				<td>WATER-IN-OIL-IN-WATER EMULSIONS OF HYDROXAMATED<br>
POLYMERS AND METHODS FOR USING THE SAME<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to flocculants and methods<br>
for using them and more particularly to hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsion flocculants and methods for flocculating process<br>
solids in industrial process streams. The flocculants and<br>
methods of the present invention find use in such industrial<br>
processes as the Bayer process for the recovery of alumina<br>
from bauxite ore.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Industrial processes that utilize liquid media most often<br>
employ solids-liquid separation techniques. In the case of<br>
aqueous systems, flocculants are often used to improve the<br>
separation process. These processes are practiced in diverse<br>
industries such as in the separation of mineral solids from<br>
aqueous systems, in the production of pulp and paper and for<br>
the treatment of paper wastes as well as for the treatment of<br>
industrial and municipal wastes. Currently flocculants are<br>
manufactured and sold either as solid powder forms which are<br>
difficult to dissolve, or as liquid forms which are easier to<br>
handle and use. Liquid forms include water-in-oil emulsions of<br>
water-soluble polymers. These have been used for many decades<br>
in many diverse industrial applications. However, these<br>
product forms suffer from several drawbacks. One of the<br>
problems of using the water-in-oil product form occurs when<br>
low temperatures (below the freezing point of the emulsion)<br>
are encountered. Often, the water-in-oil elusion will invert<br>
during the thawing process forming insoluble gels which<br>
renders the product unusable. Aqueous solutions of water-<br>
soluble polymers also tend to freeze when exposed to low<br>
temperatures making them unsuitable for adverse climates. The<br>
water-in-oil emulsion forms also suffer from the need to<br>
predilute in an aqueous medium prior to use thus adding to the<br><br>
cost for storage tanks and specialized dissolution equipment.<br>
When the process is a Bayer process, the pre-dilution step<br>
results in an additional problem since it adds water to the<br>
process necessitating the addition of additional caustic soda<br>
in order to maintain the alkalinity of the system.<br>
There is therefore a need for improved flocculant product<br>
forms which can be used in industrial processes to overcome<br>
these shortcomings.<br>
The Bayer process is almost universally used to<br>
manufacture alumina from bauxite. In this process, raw<br>
bauxite ore is first heated with caustic soda solution at<br>
temperatures in the range of 140 to 250°C. This results in the<br>
dissolution (digestion) of most of the aluminum-bearing<br>
minerals, especially the alumina trihydrate AI(OH)3 (gibbsite)<br>
and alumina monohydrate boehmite, to give a supersaturated<br>
solution of sodium aluminate (pregnant liquor). Resulting<br>
concentrations of dissolved materials are very high, with<br>
sodium hydroxide concentrations being greater than 150<br>
grams/liter and dissolved alumina being greater than 120 g/1.<br>
Any undissolved solids, usually oxides of iron which are known<br>
as red muds, are then physically separated from the aluminate<br>
solution. Typically a polymeric flocculant is used to enhance<br>
the settling and removal of the fine solid particles.<br>
Residual suspended solids are removed by a filtration step.<br>
The filtered clear solution or liquor is cooled and seeded<br>
with alumina trihydrate to precipitate a portion of the<br>
dissolved alumina. After alumina precipitation, this depleted<br>
or spent liquor is reheated and reused to dissolve more fresh<br>
bauxite.<br>
The clarified sodium aluminate liquor is seeded with<br>
alumina trihydrate crystals to induce precipitation of alumina<br>
in the form of alumina trihydrate, AI(OH)3. The alumina<br>
trihydrate particles or crystals are then separated from the<br>
concentrated caustic liquor. The alumina trihydrate crystals<br><br>
are generally separated from the liquor in which they are<br>
formed by settling and/or filtration. Coarse particles settle<br>
easily, but fine particles settle slowly resulting in yield<br>
losses. Fine particles can also blind the filters. The fine<br>
particles of alumina trihydrate which do not settle easily,<br>
are most often recycled back to digestion with the spent<br>
liquor. The un-recovered alumina trihydrate is then redigested<br>
and reprecipitated in a second cycle through the Bayer process,<br>
unnecessarily expending energy and reducing the alumina<br>
extraction capacity of the spent liquor. It is therefore<br>
highly desirable to settle as much of the trihydrate as<br>
possible so as to limit the adverse consequences of these<br>
problems.<br>
Canadian Patent No. 825,234, October 1969, uses dextran,<br>
dextran sulfate and combinations therewith containing anionic<br>
salts to improve the flocculation and filtration of alumina<br>
trihydrate from alkaline solutions thereof. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,041,269, August 1991, Moody et al., uses a flocculant for<br>
the recovery of alumina trihydrate crystals comprising a<br>
combination of dextran, or certain other polysaccharides,<br>
together with an anionic flocculant polymer including acrylic<br>
monomer.<br>
Dextran has however proved to be a poor flocculant for<br>
trihydrate crystals resulting in poor supernatant clarities.<br>
US patent 4767540 describes the use of hydroxamated<br>
polymers for flocculating suspended solids in the Bayer<br>
process.<br>
Australian patent application AU-B-46114/93 describes the<br>
use of certain hydroxamated polymers for the clarification of<br>
hydrate solids in the Bayer process.<br>
US 6,608,137 describes water-in-oil emulsions of<br>
hydroxamated polymers. These polymers must firstly be<br>
dissolved and pre-diluted in an aqueous medium (often a Bayer<br><br>
process liquor) before they may be added to the Bayer process<br>
liquor to be settled/clarified.<br>
Thus it is an objective of this invention to provide new<br>
high performance compositions of matter, water-in-oil-in-water<br>
dispersions of water-soluble polymers, which can be added<br>
directly into industrial process streams such as Bayer process<br>
steams without predilution thus eliminating the need for<br>
expensive storage vessels and associated pumping and dilution<br>
equipment. The water-in-oil-in-water emulsions of a<br>
hydroxamated polymer of the current invention also exhibit<br>
enhanced storage stability over prior art solution and water-<br>
in-oil emulsion polymers particularly when subject to<br>
extremes of low temperature.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a more effective Bayer process wherein flocculation, settling,<br>
clarification and separation of Bayer process solids,<br>
including alumina trihydrate and red mud solids from the<br>
process streams is improved by adding to the process stream a<br>
water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of a hydroxamated polymer.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are<br>
described in detail below.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
composition of a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of a water-<br>
soluble polymer in which the continuous aqueous or water phase<br>
is comprised of an aqueous solution of water-soluble salt.<br>
Preferably the water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of a water-<br>
soluble polymer is a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of a<br>
hydroxamated polymer The discontinuous phase is a water-in-oil<br>
emulsion of a water-soluble polymer preferably a water-soluble<br>
hydroxamated polymer. The terms emulsion, microemulsion or<br>
dispersion are used synonymously to indicate that the polymer<br>
is present in the form of small particles or droplets<br>
dispersed in a continuous oil phase of the oil-in-water<br><br>
emulsion. The particle size can range from 0.01 microns to 50<br>
microns and can be in the form of a microemulsion or<br>
microdispersion. The particles may also contain little or some<br>
water ranging from 0 - 90% the remainder being polymer.<br>
Preferably the particle size range is 0.05 to 10 microns. The<br>
hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-water emulsions of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by mixing a water-in-oil emulsion or<br>
dispersion of a hydroxamated polymer with water or an aqueous<br>
solution of water-soluble salt. The water soluble salt can be<br>
any salt which prevents the polymer from dissolving.<br>
Preferably the salt is a salt containing aluminum or calcium.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided an improved method for the flocculation,<br>
clarification and separation of solids from an industrial<br>
process stream comprising adding to the process stream a<br>
water-in-oil-in-water emulsion or dispersion of a water-<br>
soluble polymer. When the process stream is a Bayer process<br>
stream, the solids consist of as red mud (waste) or alumina<br>
trihydrate solids (product). The water-in-oil-in-water<br>
emulsion or dispersion of the water-soluble polymer is added<br>
in an amount effective to improve the clarification of said<br>
process stream by reducing the amount of suspended solids<br>
present in the supernatant. When the process is a Bayer<br>
process stream the preferred flocculant is a water-in-oil-in-<br>
water emulsion of a hydroxamated polymer but can include other<br>
flocculants such as polymers of acrylic acid.<br>
Hydroxamated polymers are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art and are specifically disclosed, as are methods for<br>
their production, in U.K. Patent Application 2171127 and U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 3,345,344; 4,480,067; 4,532,046; 4,536,296 and<br>
4,587,306, 4767540, and 6,608,137 which are hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Generally, these<br>
hydroxamated polymers may be produced by reacting a pendant<br>
reactive group, in solution, with a hydroxylamine or its salt<br><br>
at a temperature ranging from about 50 C. to 100 C. From about<br>
1-90% of the available pendant reactive groups of the polymer<br>
may be replaced by hydroxamic groups in accordance with said<br>
procedures.<br>
The water-in-oil-in-water emulsions of polymers of this<br>
invention may be prepared by adding to an aqueous solution of<br>
water-soluble salt a water-in-oil emulsion of a polymer most<br>
preferably a hydroxamated polymer. Preferably, the order of<br>
addition may be reversed/ i.e., the aqueous solution of water-<br>
soluble salt may be added to the water-in-oil emulsion of a<br>
polymer which is most preferably a hydroxamated polymer.<br>
Alternatively the order of addition may be reversed i.e. the<br>
aqueous solution of water-soluble salt may be added to the<br>
water-in-oil emulsion of a hydroxamated polymer. Preferably<br>
the polymer is a hydroxamated polymer when the substrate to be<br>
treated is a Bayer process stream. Methods of preparation of<br>
water-in-oil emulsion of a hydroxamated polymers are described<br>
in US 6,608,137 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Generally a backbone polymer is prepared by forming<br>
a water-in-oil emulsion of a water-soluble monomer such as<br>
acrylamide by dispersing the monomer phase within an oil and<br>
surfactant phase and conducting the polymerization in the<br>
absence of oxygen by conventional polymerization techniques<br>
e.g. by the addition of redox, thermal e.g. azo initiators or<br>
by the application of UV irradiation in the presence of UV<br>
initiators. The polymeric backbone is then reacted with<br>
hydroxylamine to form the hydroxamated polymer. The<br>
concentration of hydroxamated polymer present in the water-in-<br>
oil emulsion of hydroxamated polymer can range from 1-60%<br>
usually in the range from 10-30 %. The concentration of salt<br>
present in the aqueous solution should be such as to prevent<br>
dissolution of the water-in-oil dispersion of a hydroxamated<br>
polymer. A preferred range for the concentration of water-<br>
soluble salt is from 0.1 - 10% based on the water-in-oil-in-<br><br>
water emulsion. Most preferably the range is 1-5%. Suitable<br>
water-soluble salts include sodium aluminate, aluminum sulfate,<br>
sodium chloride, potassium chloride and the like. Aluminum<br>
salts are preferred. The ratio of water-in-oil emulsion of a<br>
hydroxamated polymer to aqueous solution of water-soluble salt<br>
that is used to prepare the water-ih-oil-in-water dispersion<br>
of a hydroxamated polymer can range from 1:99 to 99:1,<br>
preferably 10:90 to 90:10 most preferably 20-50%.<br>
Any water-in-oil emulsion of hydroxamic polymer may be<br>
used. The hydroxamic polymers, or hydroxamated polymers, are<br>
well known in the art and can be prepared by post-<br>
polymerization derivatization from polymers containing pendant<br>
reactive groups, such as pendant ester, amide, anhydride and<br>
nitrile groups and the like by the reaction thereof with<br>
hydroxylamine or its salt at a temperature within the range of<br>
from about 20 degrees C to about 100 degrees C for several<br>
hours. Monomers suitable for the preparation of precursor<br>
polymers include acrylamide and esters of (meth)acrylic acid<br>
such as methyl acrylate. From about 1 to about 90 mole<br>
percent of the available pendant reactive groups of the<br>
precursor polymer may be replaced by hydroxamic groups in<br>
accordance with such procedures. Such post-polymerization<br>
derivatization may be carried out in water-in-oil emulsion or<br>
dispersion form as described in US 6,608,137. The molecular<br>
weight of the hydroxamated polymer can range from 1000 to 50 x<br>
106 . The hydroxamated polymer preferably has a weight average<br>
molecular weight of at least about 0.1 million, preferably<br>
with an IV of from about 0.5 to about 40 dl/g when measured in<br>
M NaCl at 30 degrees C.<br>
The degree of hydroxamation, may vary from about 1 to<br>
about 90 mole percent, and preferably is within the range of<br>
from about 5 to about 75 mole percent, and most preferably<br>
from about 10 to about 50 mole percent.<br><br>
The hydroxamated polymer in the preferred embodiment is<br>
predominantly anionic, although it can also contain nonionic<br>
or cationic units. Anionic monomer units other than the<br>
hydroxamic monomer units can be incorporated into the polymer<br>
and are generally carboxylic acids or sulphonic acids and are<br>
usually derived from (meth)acrylic acids, sulfoalkyl<br>
acrylamides, such as 2-sulfopropylacrylamide or<br>
acrylamidodimethylpropylsulfonic acid.<br>
The polymers used in the present invention are employed<br>
by adding them, either directly to the process stream as<br>
water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of a hydroxamated polymer or in<br>
the form of pre-diluted aqueous solutions. The process stream<br>
can be any industrial process stream from which solids need to<br>
be separated. These processes may include mineral<br>
beneficiation processes such as is used in the extraction of<br>
alumina, phosphate, and other industrial minerals, copper,<br>
zinc, lead, and precious metals, in the production of pulp and<br>
paper, for the treatment of paper wastes as well as for the<br>
treatment of industrial and municipal wastes. Preferably the<br>
process stream is a Bayer process steam e.g., one containing<br>
red mud or alumina trihydrate solids. The water-in-oil-in-<br>
water emulsion of a hydroxamated polymer is added to the<br>
process stream containing red mud or alumina trihydrate solids<br>
in an amount at least sufficient to settle said suspended<br>
solids. Generally, for best results, at least about 0.1 mg of<br>
the hydroxamated polymer, per liter of the process stream<br>
should be employed. More preferably, at least 1.0 mg of the<br>
hydroxamated polymer is added. It is understood, that higher<br>
amounts than those just stated may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention, although generally<br>
a point is reached in which additional amounts of hydroxamated<br>
polymer do not improve the separation rate over already<br>
achieved maximum rates, Thus, it is uneconomical to use<br>
excessive amounts when this point is reached.<br><br>
The addition of the water-in-oil-in-water emulsion of<br>
hydroxamated polymer improves the supernatant clarity thereby<br>
reducing the amount of suspended solids which are typically<br>
very fine. Improving supernatant clarity minimizes alumina<br>
trihydrate losses and improves supernatant filtration by<br>
reducing filter blinding, or eliminates the need for<br>
filtration.<br>
It is also believed that the hydroxamated polymer<br>
clarification aid will improve the alumina-caustic liquor<br>
separation on a vacuum filter by forming a more porous filter<br>
cake.<br>
When the process stream is a red mud stream, superior<br>
settling rates and supernatant clarities are achieved compared<br>
to prior art polymers. Also, it has surprisingly been found<br>
that the water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsions<br>
of the instant invention are more effective flocculants for<br>
treating red muds which are contaminated with silicon<br>
containing minerals commonly known as desilication products or<br>
DSP.<br>
Comparative Example A<br>
Superfloc® HF80 is a commercially available water-in-oil<br>
emulsion containing polymer having about 60 mole% of<br>
hydroxamate groups. It is manufactured by Cytec Industries Inc.<br>
of Garret Mountain, NJ.<br>
Examples 1- 6 Preparation of hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-<br>
water polymer emulsions<br>
Six (6) samples of stable hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-<br>
water polymer emulsions are prepared by using the following<br>
procedure. Concentrations of components in each of the six<br>
samples are shown in Table 1. Powdered sodium aluminate<br>
trihydrate (Na2O.Al2O3.3H2O) and sodium hydroxide are dissolved<br>
in de-ionized water. Superfloc® HF80 is then added rapidly to<br>
a vigorously stirred solution of the sodium aluminate and<br><br>
sodium hydroxide to form stable water-in-oil-in-water<br>
emulsions of hydroxamated polymer.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7- 15 Preparation of hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-<br>
water polymer emulsions<br>
Stable water-in-oil-in-water emulsions of hydroxamated polymers are prepared by using the following procedure. A<br>
solution of 250 grams/liter of aluminum sulfate hydrate (Al2<br>
(SO4) 3.18H2O) and 100% sodium hydroxide are dissolved in<br>
deionized water. Example A is then added rapidly to the<br>
vigorously stirred caustic aluminum sulfate solution. Table 2 lists several water-in-oil-in water formulations that are<br>
prepared by this procedure.<br><br>
EXAMPLE,16 Preparation of a hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-water<br>
polymer emulsion<br>
A stable water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsion is prepared by using the following procedure. One<br><br>
hundred fifty (150) parts of a solution of aluminum sulfate is<br>
added with vigorous stirring and at a constant rate over 30 to<br>
40 minutes to 150 parts of Example A. The aluminum sulfate<br>
solution is prepared using 18.6 parts of 48% aluminum sulfate<br>
hydrate (Al2 (SO4) 3.14H2O) and 131.4 parts of deionized-water.<br>
The concentration of Example A in the final product is 50%,<br>
and the concentration of Al2 (SO4)3.14H2O is 2.97%. The final<br>
product bulk viscosity is 780cps and the pH is 10.1. This<br>
example demonstrates that the aqueous phase can be added to<br>
the water-in-oil hydroxamated polymer emulsion to produce a<br>
stable water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsion.<br>
EXAMPLE 17 Preparation of hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-water<br>
polymer emulsion<br>
A stable water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsion is prepared by using the following procedure. One<br>
hundred fifty (150) parts of a 2.2% solution of calcium<br>
chloride (CaCl2) in DI-water is added with vigorous stirring<br>
and at a constant rate over 43 minutes, to 150 parts Example A.<br>
The concentration of Example A in the final product is 50%,<br>
and the concentration of CaCl2 is 1.1%. The final product,<br>
stable water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsion had<br>
a bulk viscosity of 10,750cps and pH of 10.1.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Example 15 is thermally cycled for 4 cycles from room<br>
temperature to a temperature of between -20°C and -30°C to<br>
simulate freeze-cycles to which the product could be subjected<br>
to when used in extreme climates. After thawing to room<br>
temperature the product is remixed to form of stable water-in-<br>
oil-in water emulsion of hydroxamated polymer.<br>
Example 19-21<br><br>
The solubility of water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated<br>
polymer emulsions of Examples 8 and 15 is compared to the<br>
solubility of Example A in 150g/l sodium hydroxide in DI water<br>
at 60°C. These conditions are similar to the conditions found<br>
in the tertiary tray feed in an alumina refinery where<br>
precipitated alumina trihydrate is flocculated, settled and<br>
separated from the liquor. The torque/viscosity build up of<br>
the solution is measured by using a mixing motor capable of<br>
increasing torque to maintain the stirring speed as the<br>
viscosity increased. Table 3 shows that comparative Example A<br>
(Example 20) did not dissolve in the simulated tertiary tray<br>
feed liquor whereas the water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated<br>
polymer emulsions of the instant invention rapidly dissolved<br>
(Examples 19, 21). Therefore the water-in-oil-in-water<br>
hydroxamated polymer emulsions can be added directly to the<br>
Bayer process stream without the use of an additional dilution<br>
step.<br><br>
Example 22-29<br>
The flocculation performance of Example 1 is compared to<br>
that of two commercial prior art alumina hydrate flocculants,<br>
dextran and Example A, in simulated tertiary tray feed as<br>
shown in table 4. The slurry is prepared using spent liquor<br>
from an alumina refinery. The spent liquor is saturated with<br>
74.8.g/l of alumina at its boiling point. The solution is then<br>
cooled and held at 70°C and then 34 g/1 of alumina is suspended<br>
in the liquor. The flocculants are diluted to 0.01% polymer<br>
concentration to aid in delivering very low doses. A 200<br>
milliliter aliquot of the slurry is then treated with the<br>
flocculants. The settling time and supernatant clarity are<br><br>
measured as a function of dose. Table 1 shows that water-in-<br>
oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsions are effective<br>
trihydrate flocqulants.<br><br>
Example 30-38<br>
The flocculation performance of water-in-oil-in-water<br>
hydroxamated polymer emulsions, Example 11 and 15 are compared<br>
to that of two commercial prior art hydrate flocculants,<br>
dextran and Example A, in tertiary tray feed obtained from an<br>
alumina refinery. The tray feed temperature is measured at<br>
70°C and had a caustic content 228 gram/liter. The flocculants<br>
are all added to the tertiary tray feed without pre-dilution.<br>
The flocculants are added to 1 liter of tertiary tray slurry<br>
in a 1 liter graduated cylinder. The flocculant and slurry<br>
are thoroughly mixed with 10 up and down strokes of a plunger<br>
(perforated disk of slightly smaller diameter than that of the<br>
cylinder with a 1/8 inch rod attached to the center of one<br>
side of the disk). The interface of the settling hydrate is<br>
timed from the 900 to 700 milliliter graduations. The<br>
supernatant clarity is also measured 1 minute after the mixing<br>
stopped. Table 5 lists the results of these experiments and<br>
shows that the water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsions of the instant invention perform much better than<br>
the prior art flocculants.<br><br><br>
The flocculation of red mud obtained from an alumina<br>
refinery digester blow-off with water-in-oil-in-water<br>
hydroxamated polymer emulsions (Example 11 and 15) is<br>
demonstrated in Table 6. The blow-off solids is 39.3<br>
grams/liter, blow-off temperature is &gt;100°C, caustic<br>
concentration is 204 grams/liter and the alumina to caustic<br>
ratio (A/C) is 0.675. Example 11 and 15 are all added to the<br>
blow-off process stream without pre-dilution. The flocculants<br>
are added to 1 liter samples of digester blow-off in a 1 liter<br>
graduated cylinder. The flocculant and slurry are thoroughly<br>
mixed with 5 or 10 up and down strokes of a plunger<br>
(perforated disk of slightly smaller diameter than that of the<br>
cylinder with a 1/8 inch rod attached to the center of one<br>
side of the disk). The interface of the settling hydrate is<br>
timed from the 900 to 700 milliliter graduations. Table 6<br>
shows that water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsions can be added directly to a Bayer process steam<br>
containing red mud solids without the need for a predilution<br>
step.<br><br><br><br>
Example 41 Preparation of a hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-water<br>
polymer emulsion<br>
A stable water-in-oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer<br>
emulsion was prepared by using the following procedure. 150<br>
parts of aluminum sulfate hydrate (Al2 (SO4) 3.14H2O) was<br>
dissolved in 177.5 parts of DI water. This was added with<br>
vigorous stirring to 105 parts Example A.<br>
Example 42 Preparation of a hydroxamated water-in-oil-in-water<br>
polymer emulsion<br><br>
Following the procedure of Example 41, a stable water-in-<br>
oil-in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsion was prepared from a<br>
water-in-oil emulsion of a commercially available water-in-oil<br>
emulsion of a hydroxamated polyacrylamide similar to Example A<br>
except that the degree of hydroxamation was about 25 mole %.<br>
This is designated Comparative Example B.<br>
Examples 43-54 Red Mud Flocculation Tests.<br>
Table 7 shows the results of red mud settling tests<br><br>
comparing the performance of Examples 41 and 42 water-in-oil-<br>
in-water hydroxamated polymer emulsions of the present<br>
invention with that of prior art products. The data clearly<br>
show that the polymers of the instant invention yield superior<br>
settling rates and clarities (lower NTU).<br><br><br>
Examples 55-58.<br>
Red mud settling tests similar to Examples 43 - 54 were<br>
carried out except that 7.5%, based on red mud solids, of a<br>
synthetic desilication product (DSP) commonly found as a<br>
contaminant in red mud circuits in the Bayer process was added<br>
to the liquor. The data clearly show that the polymers of the<br>
instant invention yield superior settling rates and clarities<br>
(lower NTU) even when DSP is present.<br><br><br>
