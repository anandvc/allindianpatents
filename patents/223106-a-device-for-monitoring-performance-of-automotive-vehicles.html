				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for monitoring and analysis of different automotive vehicle performance characteristics like wheel slip, speed, acceleration, fuel consumption, dynamic roll radius and RPM.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The performance of any automotive vehicles is judged by measuring a number of performance characteristics during its dynamic stage. These performance characteristics are wheel slip during break and acceleration, dynamic roll radius, maximum speed, fuel consumption, RPM measurement etc. and variety of transducers are employed to measure the above mentioned performance evaluation parameters. For example, during dynamic state of vehicle, some amount of wheel slip occurs between road wheels and road at their contact point during acceleration and constant speed run of the vehicle. Although, wheel slip is an undesirable phenomena for a vehicle, it can not be completing eliminated. Wheel slip measurement is an important dynamic characteristic of the dynamic performance of the vehicle. This quantity forms an important performance characteristic for design and performance evaluation of a vehicle. We need an extremely accurate and precise sensor for the measurement of wheel slip. Similarly, the other performance characteristics are also needed to be monitored and analysed in order to predict the performance of any automotive vehicle.<br>
There are some devices, known in art, which are capable of evaluating some of the performance characteristics of automotive vehicles mentioned above. Basically, these devices are microprocessor based and are stand alone systems. These devices employ dedicated embedded microprocessors for such measurements and measured parameters are displayed in the I CD display panel. The device can be configured for measurement of one such performance characteristic at a time. However these devices, known in the art, suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
One major disadvantage of the these known devices is that these devices utilise dedicated embedded processors with fixed performance<br>
parameters and thus lacking versatility in terms of upgradation of capabilities and performance of these devices.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these known devices is that these devices suffer from limited memory of embedded processors and thus putting a limitation on amount of data which can be stored and analysed.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these known devices is that these devices can not monitor a variety of performance characteristic simultaneously.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these known devices is that these devices can not process data from more than one wheel of the automotive vehicle.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the these known devices is that these devices can not show the values of all the measured parameters in real time.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the these known devices is that these devices are not very accurate in evaluation of automotive vehicle performance characteristics.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these known devices is that these devices can not store a variety of performance characteristics which can be utilised in future as per need.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these devices is that these devices can not relate to more than two sensors at a time for monitoring of performance characteristics.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these devices is that the performance of such devices is limited by the performance of microprocessors used therein.<br>
Still further disadvantage of these devices is that these devices can not compute and analyse the performance evaluation parameters in real time<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these devices is that these devices can not store calibration data for all the transducers being used in the device.<br>
