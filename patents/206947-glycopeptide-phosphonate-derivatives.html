PRIORITY OF INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Number 60/213410, filed 22 June 2000, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to novel phosphonate derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics and related compounds. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives, methods of using such glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives as antibacterial agents, and processes and intermediates useful for preparing such glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives.<br>
Background<br>
Glycopeptides (e.g. dalbaheptides) are a well-known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms (see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)). These complex multi-ring peptide compounds are very effective antibacterial agents against a majority of Gram-positive bacteria. Although potent antibacterial agents, the glycopeptides antibiotics are not used in the treatment of bacterial diseases as often as other classes of antibiotics, such as the semi-synthetic penicillins, cephalosporins and lincomycins, due to concerns regarding toxicity.<br>
In recent years, however, bacterial resistance to many of the commonly-used antibiotics has developed (see J. E. Geraci et al., Mayo Clin. Proc. 1983, 55, 88-91; and M. Foldes, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983, 77,21-26). Since glycopeptide antibiotics are often effective against these resistant strains of bacteria, glycopeptides such as vancomycin have become the drugs of last resort for treating infections caused by these organisms. Recently, however, resistance to vancomycin has appeared in various microorganisms, such .as vancomycin-<br><br>
resistant enterococci (VRE), leading to increasing concerns about the ability to effectively treat bacterial infections in the future (see Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology, 1995, 17, 364-369; A. P. Johnson et al., Clinical Microbiology Rev., 1990, 3, 280-291; G. M. Eliopoulos, European J. Clinical Microbiol, Infection Disease, 1993,12, 409-412; and P. Courvalin, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother, 1990, 34, 2291-2296).<br>
A number of derivatives of vancomycin and other glycopeptides are known in the art. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,497,802; 4,698,327; 5,591,714; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889. Other derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 802 199; EP 0 801 075; EP 0 667 353; WO 97/28812; WO 97/38702; WO 98/52589; WO 98/52592; and in/. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1996,118, 13107-13108;/ Amer. Chem. Soc, 1997, IIP, 12041-12047; and/ Amer. Chem. Soc, 1994,116,4573590.<br>
Despite the above referenced disclosures, a need currently exists for novel glycopeptide derivatives having effective antibacterial activity and an improved mammalian safety profile. In particular, a need exists for glycopeptide derivatives which are effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganism, including vancomycin-resistant microorganisms, and which have reduced tissue accumulation and/or nephrotoxicity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives having highly effective antibacterial activity and an improved mammalian safety profile. More specifically, the glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives of the invention unexpectedly exhibit reduced tissue accumulation and/or nephrotoxicity when administered to a mammal.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides glycopeptide compounds substituted with one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) substituents comprising one or more (e.g., 1, 2 or 3) phosphono (-POjH groups; or apharmaceutically acceptable salt, stereoisomer, or prodrug thereof. Preferably, the glycopeptide compound is substituted with one or two substituents comprising one or two phosphono groups. More preferably, the glycopeptide compound is substituted with one<br><br>
substitueat comprising one or two phosphono groups, preferably one phosphono group. Optionally, the glycopeptide compounds of this invention may also be substituted with other substituents not comprising a phosphono group, provided that at least one substituent comprises one or more phosphono groups.<br>
Accordingly, in one preferred embodiment, this invention provides a glycopeptide compound substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent comprising one or two phosphono (-POjH;) groups; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, stereoisomer, or prodrug thereof. Preferably, the phosphono-containing substituent is attached to the carbonyl group at the C-tenninus through an amide bond, an ester bond, or a thioester bond; more preferably, through an amide bond. Preferably, the phosphono-containing substituent comprises one phosphono group. Particularly preferred phosphono-containing substituents at the C-terminus include phosphonomethylamino, 3-phosphonopropylamino and 2-hydroxy-2-ph6sphonoemyIamino.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, this invention provides a glycopeptide compound substituted at the R-terminus (on the resorcinol ring) with a substituent comprising one or two phosphono (-POJHJ) groups; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, stereoisomer, or prodrug thereof. Preferably, the phosphono-containing substituent is attached to the R-terminus (i.e., the resorcinol ring) through the nitrogen atom of an aminomethyl group attached to the R-terminus. Preferably, the phosphono-containing substituent comprises one phosphono group. Particularly preferred phosphono-containing substituents at the R-terminus include N-(phospbonomemyl)arninomethyl; N-(2-hydroxy-2-phosphonoethyl)aminomethyl;N-carboxymethyl-N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl)aminomethyl; N,N-bis(phosphonomemyI)aminomeihyl; and N-(3 -phosphonopropyl)aminomethyl.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment, this invention provides a glycopeptide compound substituted at the C-terminus and at the R-terminus with a substituent comprising one or two phosphono (-POjH groups; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, stereoisomer, or prodrug thereof. Preferably, the phosphono-containing substituents each comprises one phosphono group.<br>

Another preferred group of compounds of the invention are phosphono derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic AS2846B (also known as ;hJoroorienticin A oy LY264S26). See for example R. Nagarajan et al., J- Org,<br><br>
Chem., 1988, 54, 9S3-9S6; and N. Tsuji et al., J. Antibiot., 1988, 41, S19-S22. The structure of this glycopeptide is similar to vancomycin, except AS2S46B contains an additional amino sugar (i.e. 4-epi-vancosarnine attached at the R3 position in formula I.) and further contains 4-epi-vancosamine in place of vancosamine in the disaccharide moiety attached at the R1 position in formula I. For example, a preferred group of compounds are N-aLkylated derivatives of A82S46B that are substituted at the C-terminus or the R-terminus with a sufastituent that comprises one or more (e.g. 1,2,3,4, or 5) phosphono (-P03H,) groups; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Another preferred group of compounds of the invention that are derivatives of A82S46B are substituted at the C-terminus and the R-terminus with substiruents that each comprises one or more(e.g. 1,2,3,4, or 5) phosphono (-P03Hj) groups. Another preferred group of compounds of the invention are phosphono derivatives of AS2846B having a 4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzyl group or a 4-(4-chlorobenzyloxy)benzyl group attached at the amino group of the 4-epi-vancosamine of the disaccharide moiety. The compounds of the invention that are phosphono derivatives of A82S46B can readily be prepared using the procedures described herein. The phosphono compounds of the invention have been found to unexpectedly exhibit reduced tissue accumulation and/or nephrotoxicity when administered to a mammal. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the phosphono moiety serves to increase the overall negative charge of the glycopeptide under physiological conditions thereby facilitating excretion from the mammal after administration. The unexpected increase in excretion of the phosphono compounds of the invention may be responsible for the reduced tissue accumulation and/or reduced nephrotoxicity observed for these compounds relative to the corresponding compounds that lack the phosphono functionality.<br><br>

The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount which is sufficient to effect treatment, as defined herein, when administered to a mammal in need of such treatment. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the subject and disease state being treated, the severity of the affliction and the manner of administration, and may be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The term "protecting group" or "blocking group" refers to any group which, when bound to one or more hydroxyl, thiol, amino, carboxy or other groups of the compounds, prevents undesired reactions from occurring at these groups and which protecting group can be removed by conventional chemical or<br><br>
enzymatic steps to reestablish the hydroxyl, thio, amino, carboxy or other group. The particular removable blocking group employed is not critical and preferred removable hydroxyl blocking groups include conventional substituents such as allyl, benzyl, acetyl, chloroacetyl, thiobenzyl, benzyHdine, phenacyl, t-butyl-diphenylsilyl and any other group that can be introduced chemically onto a hydroxyl functionality and later selectively removed either by chemical or enzymatic methods in mild conditions compatible with the nature of the product. Protecting groups are disclosed in more detail in T,W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 3[d Ed., 1999, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.<br>
Preferred removable amino blocking groups include conventional substituents such as t-buryoxycarbonyl (t-BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), fjuorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC), allyloxycarbonyl (ALOC) and the like, which can be removed by conventional conditions compatible with the nature of the product.<br>
Preferred carboxy protecting groups include esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, r-butyl etc. which can be removed by mild conditions compatible with the nature of the product.<br><br><br>
When describing vancomycin derivatives, the terra "N""1-" indicates that a substituent is covalently attached to the amino group of the vacosamine moiety of vacomycin. Similarly, the term "N1™-" indicates that a substituent is covalently attached to the amino group of the leucine moiety of vancomycin.<br>
Gp-ncTfi] Synthetic Procedures<br>
The glycopeptide compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions" can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
In the following reaction schemes, the glycopeptide compounds are depicted in a simplified form as a box "G" that shows the carboxy tenninus labeled [C], the vancosamine amino terminus labeled [V], the "non-saccharide" amino terminus (leucine amine moiety) labeled [N], and optionally, the resorcinol moiety labeled [RJ as follows:<br><br><br>
A glycopeptide compound of the present invention, which is substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more (e.g.-l, 2, 3,4, or 5) phosphono (-POJHJ) groups, can be prepared by coupling a corresponding glycopeptide compound wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group with a suitable phosphono containing compound. For example, a glycopeptide compound wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group can be coupled with a phosphono containing amine, alcohol, or thiol compound to form an amide, an ester, or a thioester, respectively.  For example a glycopeptide compound of formula I wherein R? is a nitrogen linked moiety comprising one or more phosphono groups can be prepared by coupling a corresponding glycopeptide compound of formula I wherein R3 is hydroxy with the requisite phosphono-containing amine to form the formula I wherein R3 is a nitrogen linked moiety comprising one or more phosphono groups..<br>
A glycopeptide compound of the present invention, which is substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more (e.g. 1,2, 3, 4, or 5) phosphono (-POJHJ) groups, and wherein the vancosamine amino terminus (V) is substituted, can be prepared by first reductively alkylating the corresponding glycopeptide compound wherein the vancosamine amino terminus (V) is the free amine (NH and then coupling the corresponding glycopeptide compound with the requisite phosphono containing compound (e.g. phosphono containing amine, alcohoL or thiol).<br>
By way of illustration, a glycopeptide compound, such as vancomycin, can first.be reductive alkylated as shown in the following reaction:<br><br><br>
where A represents Ra minus one carbon atom and Ra, Rb, Y, Z and x are as defined herein. This reaction is typically conducted by first contacting one equivalent of the glycopeptide, i.e., vancomycin, with an excess, preferably from 1.1 to 1.3 equivalents, of the desired aldehyde in the presence of an excess, preferably about 2.0 equivalents, of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamiiie (DIPEA) and the like. This reaction is typically<br>
1 conducted in an inert diluent, such as DMF or acetonitrile/water, at ambient temperature for about 0.25 to 2 hours until formation of the corresponding imine andVor hemiaminal is substantially complete. The resulting imine and"or hemiaminal is typically not isolated, but is reacted in situ with a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, pyridine borane, or the like, to afford the corresponding amine. This reaction is preferably conducted by contacting the<br>
" imine and/or hemiaminal with an excess, preferably about 3 equivalents, of trifiuoroacetic acid, followed by about 1 to 1.2 equivalents of the reducing agent at ambient temperature in methanol or acetonitrile/water. The resulting alkylated product is readily purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC. Surprisingly, by forming the imine and/or hemiaminal in the presence of a trialkyl amine, and then acidifying with trifiuoroacetic acid before contact with the reducing agent, the selectivity for the reductive alkylation reaction is greatly improved, i.e., reductive alkylation at the amino group of the saccharide (e.g., vancosamine) is favored over reductive alkylation at the N-terminus (e,g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1.<br>
The above process is a significantly improvement over previous methods for selectively alkylating an amino saccharide group of a glycopeptide antibiotic.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a method for alkylating a glycopeptide that comprises a saccharide-amine comprising:<br>
combining an aldehyde or ketone, a suitable base, and the glycopeptide, to provide a reaction mixture;<br>
acidifying the reaction mixture; and<br>
combining the reaction mixture with a suitable reducing agent, to provide a glycopeptide that is alkylated at the saccharide-amine. Preferably, the glycopeptide comprises at least one amino group other than the saccharide-amine.<br>
Preferably, the reductive alkylation at the saccharide-amine is favored over reductive alkylation at another amino group of the glycopeptide by at least about 10:1; and more preferably, by at least about 15:1 OT about 20:1.<br>
The reductive alkylation process of the invention is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or combination of solvents, such as, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. methylene chloride), a linear or branched ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. benzene or toluene), an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, water, 1,3-a%iemyl-3,4,5J6-terrahyaVo-2(lH)-pyrimidone, tetramethyl urea, N,N-dimethylacetamide, diethylfonnamide (DMF), l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfoxide, glycerol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, N,N-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU) or dioxane. Preferably the alkylation is carried out in acetonitrile/water, or DMF/methanol.<br>
Preferably the reduction (i.e. treatment with the reducing agent) is carried out in the presence of a protic solvent, such as, for example, an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or butanol), water, or the like.<br>
The reductive alkylation process of the invention can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 100 °C. More preferably at a temperature in a range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C, or in a range of about 20 °C to about 30 °C.<br><br>
Any suitable base can be employed in the reductive alkylation process of the invention. Suitable bases include tertiary amines (e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methyimorpholine or triethylamine) and the like.<br>
Any suitable acid can be used to acidify the reaction mixture. Suitable acids include carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. A preferred acid is trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for carrying out reductive alkylation process of the invention are known in the art. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in tbe methods of the invention, provided it is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, sodium borohydride, and zinc borohydride. The reduction can also be carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst (e.g. palladium or platinum) in the presence of a hydrogen source (e.g. hydrogen gas or cyclohexadiene). See for example,, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), 899-900,<br>
Tbe glycopeptide derivative resulting from the reductive alkylation is then coupled with a phosphono containing amine (R3-H) to form an amide bond. This reaction is illustrated by the following reaction:<br><br>
where R3 is a nitrogen-linked group that comprises one or more phospbono groups. In this reaction, the glycopeptide derivative is typically contacted with the amine in the presence of a peptide coupling reagent, such as PyBOP and HOBT, to provide the amide. This reaction is typically conducted in an inert diluent, suchasDMF, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 60°C<br><br>
for about 1 to 24 hours or until the coupling reaction is substantially complete. Subsequent deprotection using conventional procedures and reagents affords the compound of this invention.<br>
If desired, the amine coupling step described above can be conducted first to provide an amide, followed by reductive alkylation and deprotection to afford the compound of the invention.<br>
If desired, the glycopeptide compounds of this invention can also be prepared in a step-wise manner in which a precursor to the -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)X group is first attached the glycopeptide by reductive alkylation, followed by subsequent elaboration of the attached precursor using conventional reagent and procedures to form the -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)I group. Additionally, ketones may also be employed in the above-described reductive alkylation reactions to afford a-substituted amines.<br>
Any glycopeptide having an amino group may be employed in these reductive alkylation reactions. Such glycopeptides are "well-known in the art and are either commercially available or may be isolated using conventional procedures. Suitable glycopeptides are disclosed, by way of example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,067,099; 3,338,786; 3,803,306; 3,928,571; 3,952,095; 4,029,769; 4,051,237; 4,064,233; 4,122,168; 4,239,751; 4,303,646; 4,322,343; 4,378,34S; 4,497,802; 4,504,467; 4,542,018; 4,547,488; 4,548,925; 4,548,974; 4,552,701; 4,558,008; 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,661,470; 4,694,069; 4,698,327; 4,782,042; 4,914,187; 4,935,238; 4,946,941; 4,994,555; 4,996,148; 5,187,082; 5,192,742; 5,312,738; 5,451,570; 5,591,714; 5,721,208; 5,750,509; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889. Preferably, the glycopeptide employed in the above reaction is vancomycin.<br>
As illustrated in the following scheme, a phosphono containing aminoalkyl sidechain at the resorcinol moiety of a glycopeptide, such as vancomycin, can be introduced via a Mannich reaction (in this scheme, the resorcinol moiety of the glycopeptide is illustrated for clarity). In this reaction, an amine of formula NHRR" (wherein one or both of R and R" is a group that comprises one or more phosphono groups), and an aldehyde (e.g. CH-,0), such as formalin (a source of formaldehyde), are reacted with the glycopeptide under basic conditions to give the glycopeptide derivative.<br><br><br>

Utility<br>
The glycopeptide compounds of this invention, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are useful in medical treatments and exhibit biological activity, including antibacterial activity, which can be demonstrated in using the tests described herein. Such tests are well known to those skilled in the art, and are referenced and described in Lorian "Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine", Fourth Edition, Williams and Wilkins (1991).<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides methods for treating bacterial or infectious diseases, especially those caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, in animals. The compounds of this invention are particularly useful in treating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Also, the compounds are useful in treating infection due to enterococci, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Examples of such diseases include severe staphylococcal infections, such as staphylococcal endocarditis and staphylococcal septicemia. The animal treated may be either susceptible to, or -   infected with, the microorganism. The method of treatment typically comprises<br><br>
administering to the animal an amount of a compound of this invention which is effective for this purpose.<br>
In practicing this method, the antibiotic can be administered in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The treatment regimeu may require administration over extended periods of time, for example, for several days or for from one io six weeks. The amount per administered dose or the total amount administered will depend on such factors as the nature and severity of the infection, the age and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the antibiotic and the microorganism or microorganisms in the infection. Preferably, the compounds of the invention are administered intravenously.<br>
Among other properties, the glycopepride compounds of the invention have been found to have reduced mammalian toxicity when administered to a mammal. For example, the phosphono substituted derivatives of the invention have been found to have reduced liver and/or kidney accumulation compared to the corresponding non-phosphono substituted compounds. Moreover, certain compounds of this invention are expected to have reduced nephrotoxicity. Additionally, it has been discovered that the addition of a cyclodextrin compound to a pharmaceutical composition containing the glycopepride compounds of this invention further reduces the nephrotoxicity and/or tissue accumulation of the glycopeptide compound when administered to a mammal.<br>
The following synthetic and biological examples are offered to illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
In the following examples, vancomycin hydrochloride semi-hydrate was<br>
purchased from Alpharma, Inc. Fort Lee, NJ 07024 (Alpharma AS, Oslo<br>
Norway). Other reagents and reactants are available from Aldrich Chemical Co.,<br>
Milwaukee, WI 53201.<br>
General Procedure A Reductive Alkylation of Vancomycin<br>
To a mixture of vancomycin (I eq.) and the desired aldehyde (1.3 eq.) in<br>
DMF was added DEPEA (2 eq.). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature<br>
for 1-2 hours and monitored by reverse-phase HPLC. Methanol and NaCNBH3<br>
(1 eq.) were added to the solution, followed by TFA (3 eq.). Stirring was<br>
continued for an additional hour at ambient temperature. After the reaction was<br>
complete, the methanol was removed in vacuo. The residue was precipitated in<br>
acetonitrile. Filtration gave the crude product which was then purified by<br>
reverse-phase HPLC. If desired, other glycopeptides antibiotics may be used in<br>
this procedure.<br>
Geiicral Procedure B Synthesis of 2-(Decylthio)acetaldehyde<br>
Under nitrogen, to a suspension of potassium carbonate (27 g, 200 mmol) in acetone (100 rnL) was added decyl bromide (10 mL, 50rnmol) and mercaptoethanol (4.4 mL, 63 mmol).

fa Fffmpeterrninarion of Antibacterial Activity<br>
1.	Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MTCs)<br>
Bacterial strains were obtained from either American Type Tissue I Culture Collection (ATCC), Stanford University Hospital (SU), Kaiser Pennanente Regional Laboratory in Berkeley (KPB), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the San Francisco Veterans" Administration Hospital (SFVA) or the University of California San Francisco Hospital (UCSF). Vancomycin resistant enterococci were pbenotyped as Van A or Van B based on their sensitivity to teicoplanin. Some vancomycin resistant enterococci that had been genotyped as Van A, Van B, Van CI or Van C2 were obtained from the Mayo CUnic.<br>
Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured in a microdilution broth procedure under NCCLS guidelines.  Routinely, the compounds were serially diluted into Mueller-Hinton broth in 96-well microliter plates. Overnight cultures of bacterial strains were diluted based on absorbance at 600 nm so that the final concentration in each well was 5 x 10s cfu/mL. Plates were returned to a 35 DC incubator. The following day (or 24 hours in the case of<br><br>
\ Enterococci strains), MICs were determined by visual inspection of the plates. Strains routinely tested in the initial screen included methicillin-seasitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillm-iesistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin sensitive Enierococcus faecium (VSE Fm), vancomycin sensitive Enterococcusfaecalis (VSE Fs), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium also resistant to teicoplanin (VRE Fra Van A),  vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium sensitive to teicoplanin (VRE Fm Van B), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis also resistant to teicoplanin (VRE Fs Vac A), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to teicoplanin (VRE Fs Van B), enterococcus gallinarium of the Van A genotype (VRE Gm Van A), enterococcus gallinarium of the Van C-l genotype (VRE Gm Van C-l), enterococcus casseliflavus of the Van C-2 genotype (VRE Cs Van C-2), enterococcus flavescens of the Van C-2 genotype (VRE Fv Van C-2), and penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSRP). Because of the inability of PSSP and PSRP to grow well in Mueller-Hinton broth, MICs with those strains were determined using either TSA broth supplemented with defibrinated blood or blood agar plates. Compounds which had significant activity against the strains mentioned above were then tested for MIC values in a larger panel of clinical isolates including the species listed above as well as non-speciated coagulase negative Staphylococcus both sensitive and resistant to methicUlin (MS-CNS and MR-CNS). In addition, they were tested for MICs against gram negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
