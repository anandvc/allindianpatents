The compounds according to formula (I) may be prepared according to the following reaction schemes.<br>
fat Preparation of a compound of formula (II).<br>
Schemes 1,2 and 3 demonstrate that a compound of formula E, H, K, L, N, O, P, R,<br>
SjLH-ViiViXOTZ [where R1 and R2 are as defined above for formula (II); and R' is<br>
C].s aikyl] {each of which is a compound of formula (U), as defined above} maybe<br>
prepared by a reaction sequence starting with a 1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid diester<br>
of formula A [Y.Tanafca et al., Tetrahedron, 29,3271 (1973)] [where each R' is,<br>
independently, Ci-5 alkyl] (preferably the dimethyl ester).<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Treatment of A with an alkylating agent [such as R2-halo (where R2 is as defined above for formula (II); and halo is preferably iodo) or an appropriate sulphate, sulphonate or carbonate ester] in the presence of a base [such as K2CO3, Na2C03 or NEt3] in a suitable solvent [such as acetonitrile, DMF or dimethylacetamide] at ambient to elevated temperatures furnishes a mixture of regioisomers, of formulae B and C, which may be separated by conventional methods.   Saponification of a compound of formula B with up to one equivalent of a base [such as KOH, NaOH or LiOH] in a protic solvent [such as methanol], preferably under reflux conditions, provides a mono-ester of formula D. Subsequent reaction of a compound of formula D with a fmorinating agent [such as DAST (diethylamino sulphur trifloride) or, preferably, SF4] in the presence of hydrofluoric acid gives a 5-CF3-l,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid ester of formula E.<br><br>
Alternatively, treatment of a compound of formula D with a chlorinating agent [such as thionyl chloride or phosgene] under standard conditions results in an acid chloride of formula F which may be reduced catalytically in an inert solvent [for example ethyl acetate or THF] in the presence of a base [for example Htinig base] to give an aldehyde-ester of formula G (modified Rosenmund conditions).   Fluorination of a compound of formula G_ by means of DAST, dimethoxy-DAST or SFt in the presence of hydrofluoric acid, optionally with solvent, preferably at elevated temperatures, forms a 5-difluoromethy3-l,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid ester of formula H.<br>
Metal hydride reduction of a compound of formula G [for example by NaBHi or LiBHfl] in methanol provides a 5-hydroxymethyI-l ,2,3-triazole of formula J, from which a 5-fluoromethyl derivative of formula K may be obtained by fluorination under mild conditions, preferably with DAST at low temperatures (0 to -78Â°C) in an inert solvent [such as dichloromethane].<br>
Alternatively, hydride reduction of a compound of formula J by conventional methods [for example via its mesylate, tosylate or iodide] results in a 5-methyl-1,2,3-triazole of formula L.<br>
Chlorination of compound of formula D [for example by thionyl chloride] followed by treatment with ammonia, preferably in a protic solvent [such as water, methanol or ethanol] furnishes an amide of formula M from which a 5-cyano-l ,2,3-triazole of formula N may be obtained by means of a dehydrating agent [such as phosphorylchloride].<br><br><br>
Further transformations to prepare a compound of formula (TJ) [where R1 and R2 are as defined above for formula (I); Y is OR' and R' is Q.s alkyl] include iHofinann rearrangement of an amide of formula M with NaOBr or NaOCl in the presence of NaOH to give a 5-amino-l,2,3-triazole of formula O.<br>
Diazotation of a compound of formula O by means of sodium nitrite under aqueous acidic conditions [for example sulphuric acid] or with a nitrite ester [for example (0-amyl nitrite] in an organic solvent [for example acetone, dichloromethane or THF] in the presence of a halogenide [such as CuCl or CuBr] gives a 5-halo-l,2,3-triazole of formula P [where halo is CI or Br] which on treatment with a fluorinating agent [such as KFor CsF], preferably in DMF orN-methylpyrrolidone at elevated temperatures, results in a S-fluoro-lAS-triazole of formula V.<br>
By diazotation of a compound of formula O and subsequent acidic aqueous hydrolysis under heating, a 5-hydroxy-l ,2,3-triazole of formula Q may be obtained. Treatment of a compound of formula 0_ with an alkylating agent [such as methyl iodide, dimethylsulphate or dimethylcarbonate] and a base [for example NaH, K2COj or Na3C03] in a polar solvent [for example DMF, DMSO or CH3CN] gives a 5-methoxy-l,2,3-triazole of formula R which may be converted to a tricbloromethoxy derivative of formula S with a chlorinating agent [such as chlorine] in the presence of azoisobutyronitrile (AJBN) or ultra-violet irradiation at elevated temperature. By treatment of a compound of formula S with a fluorinating agent [for example KF or SbF3] a 5-trifluoromethoxy~l,2,3-triazole of formula T may be prepared.<br><br>
Oxidation of a compound of formula O with {for example sodium perborate] or treatment according to A. Sudalai et al. [ Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 40,405 (2001)] leads to a 5-nitro derivative of formula U. Alternatively, a compound of formula U may also be obtained by treatment of a compound of formula P or V with NaNO; in an polar solvent [such as DMF, sulpholane or N-methylpyrrolidone] at elevated temperatures.<br><br>
Transformations of a compound of formula (II') [where R1 and R2 are as defined in ' formula (I); Y is OR'; andR' is Ci-salkyl] to give a compound of formula (II) [where Rl and R1 are as defined in formula (I) and Y is halo or hydroxy] includes saponification with a base [such as KOH or NaOH] in a protic solvent [such as methanol, ethanol or water], at ambient or elevated temperature to give a l,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid of formula W. Chlorination of a compound of formula W under standard conditions [for example with thionyl chloride, phosgene or oxaly] chloride] yields an acid chloride of formula Y.<br>
Fluorination of a compound of formula W with DAST or SF4 under mild conditions [low to ambient temperatures], preferably in an inert solvent [such as dichloromethane] gives an acid fluoride of formula Z.<br>

Surprisingly, il has now been found that the novel compounds of formula (I) have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting plants against diseases that are caused by fungi as well as by bacteria and viruses.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used in the agricultural sector and related fields of use as active ingredients for controlling plant pests. The novel compounds are distinguished by excellent activity at low rates of application, by being well tolerated by'<br><br>
plants and by being environmentally safe. They have very useful curative, preventive and systemic properties and are used for protecting numerous cultivated plants. The compounds of formula I can be used to inhibit or destroy the pests that occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time protecting also those parts of the plants that grow later, for example from phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
It is also possible to use compounds of formula (I) as dressing agents for the treatment of plant propagation material, in particular of seeds (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (e.g. rice), for the protection against fungal infections as well as against phytopathogenic fungi occurring in the soil.<br>
Furthermore the compounds according to present invention may be used for controlling fungi in related areas, for example in the protection of technical materials, including wood and wood related technical products, in food storage, in hygiene management, etc.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes: Fungi imperfecta' (e.g. Botrytis, Pyricularia, Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora and Altemaria) and Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). Additionally, they are also effective against the Ascomycetes classes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula) and of the Oomycetes classes (e.g. Phytophthora, Pythium, Plasmopara). Outstanding activity has been observed against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Furthermore, the novel compounds of formula I are effective against phytopathogenic bacteria and viruses (e.g. against Xanthomonas spp, Pseudomonas spp, Erwinia amylovora as well as against the tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Within the scope of present invention, target crops to be protected typically comprise the following species of plants: cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, drupes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber plants (pumpkins, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus,<br><br>
cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamomum, camphor) or plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation. To this end they are conveniently formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, eoatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates, and also encapsulations e.g. in polymeric substances. As with the type of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The compositions may also contain .further adjuvants such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders or tackifiers as well as fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other formulations for obtaining special effects.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are substances useful in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described in WO97/33890.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the crop area or plant to be treated, simultaneously or in succession with further compounds. These further compounds can be e.g. fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations which influence the growth of plants. They can also be selective herbicides as well as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of these preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or application promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) can be mixed with other fungicides, resulting in some cases in unexpected synergistic activities. Mixing components which are particularly preferred are azoles, such as azaconazole, BAY 14120, bitertano!, bromuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole, epoxiconazole, fenbuconazole, fluquinconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, hexaconazole, imazalil, imiben-conazole, ipconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil, pefurazoate, penconazole, pyrifenox, prochloraz, propiconazole, simeconazole, iebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon.<br><br>

A preferred method of applying a compound of formula (I), or an agrochemical composition which contains at least one of said compounds, is foliar application. The frequency of application and the rate of application will depend on the risk of infestation by the corresponding pathogen. However, the compounds of formula I can also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid formulation, or by applying the compounds in solid form to the soil,<br><br>
e.g. in granular form (soil application). In crops of water rice such granulates can be applied to the flooded rice field. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seeds (coating) by impregnating the seeds or tubers either with a liquid formulation of the fungicide or coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
A formulation [that is, a composition containing the compound of formula (I)] and, if desired, a solid or liquid adjuvant, is prepared in a known manner, typically by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound with extenders, for example solvents, solid carriers and, optionally, surface active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The agrochemical formulations will usually contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 95% byweight, of the compound of formula I, 99.9 to l%by weight, preferably 99.8 to 5% by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 5g to 2kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from lOg to 1kg a.i./ha, most preferably from 20g to 600g a.i./ha. When used as seed drenching agent, convenient dosages are from lOmg to lg of active substance per kg of seeds.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
