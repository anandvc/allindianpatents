7-SUBSTITUTED  TETRACYCLINE COMPOUNDS<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/275,576, entitled "7-Substituted Tetracycline Compounds" filed March 13, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/216,760, entitled "7-Substituted Sancycline Compounds" filed on July 7,2000; the entire contents of each of these applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected fi:om many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the name chlortetracycline. Two years later, oxytetracycline became available. The elucidation of the chemical structure of these conipounds confirmed their similarity and furnished the analytical basis for the production of a third member of this group in 1952, tetracycline. A new family of tetracycline compounds, without the  ring-attached methyl group present in earlier tetracyclines, was prepared in 1957 and became publicly available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972,<br>
Recently, research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic conditions and routes of administration. New tetracycline analogues have also been investigated which may prove to be equal to or more effective than the originally introduced tetracycline compounds. Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,165,531; 3,454,697; 3,557,280; 3,674,859; 3,957,980; 4,01,889; 4,024,272; and 4,126,680, These patents are representative of the range of pharmaceutically active   -tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions.<br>
Historically, soon after their initial development and introduction, the tetracyclines were found to be highly effective pharmacologically agmnst rickettsiae; a number of gram-positiye and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence, tetracyclines became known as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent establishment of their in vitro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetmcyclines as a class rapidly became widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directly to the emergence of resistance<br><br>
to these antibiotics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal ar pathogenic (e.g., pneumococci and Sahnonella). The rise of tetracycline-resistant organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline' analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br><br>

In a further embodiment, tiie invention pertains to 7-substituted tetracycline compounds of the formulae:<br>
The invention also pertains to each of the 7-substituted tetracycline compounds shown in Table 2, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, and prodrugs.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of this invention can be synfliesized using the methods described in Schemes 1-8.<br>
Certain 7-substituted tetracycline compounds can be synthesized by the method shown in Scheme 1. Although in each scheme saiicycline is used as the tetracycline compound, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the methodology can.4 also be applied to other tetracycline compounds such as tetracycline and doxycycline.<br><br><br>
Generally, 7-substituted tetracycline compounds can be synthesized as<br>
shown in Scheme 1 for sancycline. Sancycline (1 A) is treated with sulfuric acid and<br>
sodium nitrate. The resulting product is 7-nitro (IB) sancycline (in a mixture with the 9-<br>
position isomers). The nitro sancycline compound is then treated with hydrogen gas and<br>
a platinum catalyst to yield the 7-amino sancycline compound, IC. To sjoithesize 7<br>
derivatives, the 7-amino sancycline compound is treated with HONO, to yield the<br>
diazonium salt (ID). The salt can subsequently be treated with numerous compoxmds<br>
possessing an alkene or n bond functional group such as alkenes, aryls, and alkynyls<br>
(e.g., rBr) yielding the 7-substituted sancycline compound (IE).<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 2, tetracyclme compounds of the iriventidn Wherem r is a carbamate or a urea derivative can be synthesized using the following protocol. Sancyclihe (2A) is treats with NaNOa under acidic conditions forming 7-4 sancycline (2B) in a mixture of positional isomers. 7-nitrosancycUne (2B) is then treated with H2 gas and a platinxmi catalyst to form the 7-amino sancycUne derivative (2C). To form the urea derivative (2E), isocyanate (2D) is reacted with the 7-amino sancycline derivative (2C). To form the carbamate (20), the appropriate acid chloride ester (2F) is reacted with 2C.<br>
■	'4<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 3, tetracycline compounds of the invention, wherein r is a heterocyclic (i.e, iMazole) substituted amino group can be synthesized using thie above protocol. 7-amino sancycline (3 A) is reacted wth Fmoc-isothiocyanate (3B) to produce the protected thiourea (3C). The protected thiourea (3C) is then deprotected yielding the active sancycline thiourea (3D) compound. The sancycline thiourea (3D) is reacted with an a-haloketone (3E) to produce a thiazole substituted 7-amino sancycline (3F).<br><br>
7- alkenyl tetracycline compounds, such as 7-alkynyl sancycline (4A) and 7-alkenyl sancycline (4B), can be hydrogenated to form alkyl 7- substituted tetracycline compoimds (e.g., 7-alkyl sancycline, 4C). Scheme 4 depicts the selective hydrogenation of the 7" position double or triple bond, in saturated methanol and hydrochloric acid solution with a palladiimi/carbon catalyst imder pressure, to jdeld the product.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 5, a general synthetic scheme for synthesizing 7-position aryl derivatives is shown, A Suzuki coupling of an aryl boronic acid with an iodosancycline compound is shown, An iodo sancycline compoxmd (5B) can be Synthesized from sancycline by treatmg sancycline (5A) with at least one equivalent N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) Under acidic conditions- The reaction is quenched, and tiie restilting 7-iodo sancycline (5B) can then be purified using standard techniques known in tiie art. To form the aryl derivative, 7-iodo sancycline (5B) is treated with an aqueous base (e.g., NaaCOa) and an appropriate boronic acid (5C) and under an inert atmosphere. The reaction is catalyzed witii a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(OAc)2). The product (5D) can be purified by metiiods known in the art (such as HPLC), Other 7-aryl and alkynyl tetracycline compounds can be synthesized using similar protocols.<br>
The 7-substituted tetracycline compounds of the invention can also be syntiiesized using Stille cross couplings. Stille cross couplings can be performedusing an appropriate tin reagent (e,g., r-SnBua) and a halogenated tetracycline compound, (e.g., 7-iodosancycline). The tin reagent and tiie iodosancycline compound can be treated with a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or Pd(AsPh3)2Cl2) and, optionally, with an additional copper salt, e.g., Cul. The resulting compound can then be purified using techniques known in tiie art.<br><br><br>
The aiyl derivatives formed by Suzuki or Stille couplings, can be further derivitized. For example in Schenie 6, a fonnyl aryl sancycline (6A), an aniine, and a solvent (e.g., 1,2 dichloroethane) are combined in a reaction flask. A reducing agent is tiien added (e.g., NaBH(0Ac)3. and the reaction is allowed to proceed proceed to completion to yield the product (6B). The product is purified and characterized using standard methods.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can dso be synthesized using cross coupling reactions. As shoAvn in Scheme 7, Heck-tj4e cross-coupl4 performed by suspending a halogenated tetracycline compound (e.g., 7-iodosancycline, 7A) and an appropriate palladium or other transition metal cataLyst (e.g., Pd(0Ac)2 and Cvl) in an appropriate solvent (e.g., degassed acetonitrile). The substrate, a reactive alkene (7B) or alkyne (7D), and triethylamine are then added and titie mixture is heated for several hours, before being cooled to room temperature. The resulting 7-substituted alkenyl (7C) or 7-substituted all4nyl (7E) tetracycline compound can then be pmified using techniques known in the art<br><br><br>
To prepare 7-(2'-Chloro-alkenyl)-tetracycline compounds, the following procedure can be used, 7-(alkynyl)-sancycline (8A) is dissolved in saturated methanol and hydrochloric acid and stirred. The solvent is then removed to yield the product<br>

The language "tetracycline compound req&gt;bnsive state" includes states which can be treated, prevented, or otherwise ameliorated by the administration of a tetracycline compound of the invention. Tetracycline compound responsive states include bacterial infections (including those which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds), cancer, diabetes, and other states for which tetracyclme compounds have been found to be active (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,789,395; 5,834,450; and 5 j532,227). Compounds of the invention can be used to prevent or control important mammalian and veterinary diseases such as diarrhea, mrinary tract infections, infections<br><br>
of skin and skin structure, ear, nose and throat infections, wound infection, mastitis and the like. In addition, methods for treating neoplasms using tetracycline compounds of the invention are also included (van der Bozert et al. Cancer res., 48:6686-6690 (1988)).<br>
Bacterial infections may be caused by a wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The compounds of the invention are usefiil as antibiotics against organisms which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds. The antibiotic activity of the tetracycline compounds of the invention may be determined using the method discussed in Example 2, or by using the in vitro standard brotii dilution method described in Wmtz, J.

Salmonella4 E. hirae, A. baumanii, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, P. aei4ginosa, E.faecium, E, coli, S. aureus or E.faecalis, In one embodiment, the tetmcycline compound is used to treat a bacterial infection that is resistant to other tetracycline antibiotic compounds. The tetracycline compound of the invention may be administered with a pharmaceulically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "effective amount" of the compound is that amoxmt necessary or sufficient to treat or prevent a tetracycline ci3mpound responsive state. The effective amount can vary depending on such factors as the size and wei4t of the subject, the type of illness, or the particular tetracycline compound For example, the choice of the tetracycline cpmpoxmd can affect what constitutes an 44effective amoxmt". One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the aforementioned factors and make the determination regarding the effective amount of the tetracycline compoxmd -4 without undu4 experimentation.<br>
The invention also pertains to methods of treatment against microorganism infections and associated diseases. The methods include administration of an effective amount of one or more tetracycline compounds to a subject The subject can be either a plant or, advantageouslyj an animal, e.g., a manmial, e.g., a human.<br>
In the therapeutic methods of the invention, one or more tetracycline compounds of die invention may be administered alone to a subject, or more typically a compoxmd of the invention will be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition in mixture vsdth conventional excipient, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, oral or other desired administration<br><br>
and which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds and are not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a tetmcycline compound (e.g., a compound of Formula 1, Table 2, or other compound described herein) and, optionally; a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes substances capable of being coadministered with the tetracycline compound(s), and which allow both to perform their intended function, e.g., treat or prevent a tetracycline responsive state. Suitable pharaiaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, Tinagnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin4 perfume oil, fatty acid imonoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of tiie invention.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the inventioh that are basic in nature are capable of fonning a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be Used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are those that form nontoxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceiitically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobrornide4 hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfatCi phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citmte, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fiimarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate4 fonnate, benzoate, glutamate4 methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pahnoate [Le., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often<br>
.	...»<br>
desirable in practice to initially isolate a tetracycline compound of the invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to tibe free base compound by treatment witibt an alkaline recent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid adiiition salt The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent meditim or in a suitable organic solvoit, such as methanol or elhanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the<br><br>
desired solid salt is readily obtained. The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

formed with pharmaceutically acceptable cations by conventional metiiods. Thus, these<br>
salts may be readily prepared by treating the tetracycline compound of the invention<br>
with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cation and<br>
evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure.<br>
Alternatively, a lower alfcyl alcohol solution of the tetracycline compound of the<br>
