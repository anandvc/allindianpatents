PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESORCINOL DERIVATIVES<br>
2. HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention:<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
264/MUM/2003<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
19-12-2007<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 in high yields and purity.<br><br>
Where R is a group chosen from alkyl or aryl, either cyclic or acyclic, either unsubstituted or substituted (branched) and may have heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen or sulpher).<br>
In particular it refers to the preparation of compound of formula 1 by reaction of resorcinol and organic carboxylic acid, particularly useful in cosmetic applications.<br><br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Resorcinol and its derivatives have a wide variety of applications. The largest consumption of resorcinol is in the tyre industry where the preferred hardening resins are based on resorcinol. Another value-added application of resorcinol and its derivatives is in cosmetic products. Some compounds like 2, 4 - dihydroxyacetophenone have been used in sun-protective applications or compositions for providing sun protection.<br>
Alkyl resorcinols and aromatic resorcinols are reported to possess valuable therapeutic and antiseptic properties. In particular, 4-alkyl resorcinol is reported to have skin-beautifying effect and low toxicity and irritation when applied on to human skin. Alkyl resorcinols like 4-n-butyl resorcinol have been used in skin creams and lotions which are claimed to have good bleaching and anti-microbial effect. 2-alkyl resorcinol (where the alkyl group is linear) has been reported to have skin depigmentation properties.<br><br>
US2006039 [Redro Labs, 1932] describes a process for the preparation of di-substituted derivatives of resorcinol in which the two substituting groups (maybe alkyl or aralkyi) are unlike. The process steps include reaction of resorcinol with an acid, acid chloride or acid anhydride of the aliphatic or aromatic series in the presence of a condensing agent like zinc chloride to prepare a mono-ketone derivative. The mono-ketone derivative is further reacted with an acid, acid chloride or acid anhydride of the aliphatic or aromatic series, containing a radical different from the substituting radical already present in the resorcinol derivative in the presence of zinc chloride or other suitable condensing agent to form a diketone derivative.<br>
GB793770 [Dow Chemical Co., 1958] describes a process for preparing 4,6-diacyl resorcinols by reaction of resorcinol dialkyl ether with an acyl chloride and aluminium chloride. This publication also describes that when resorcinol was employed in the above process in place of the dialkyl ether the resulting product consisted of 90 per cent of the 2,4-isomer and 10 per cent of the 4,6-isomer.<br>
Current Science, Vol. 48, No.7, Pg. 300-301, 1979 and JP59065039 (Sumitomo Chem, 1984) both report a process where resorcinol is heated with acetic acid and zinc chloride for the preparation of 2,4,dihydroxyacetophenone.<br>
US5621146 (Kuraray Co. Ltd., 1997) describes a process where resorcinol was reacted with acetic acid in the presence of a proton acid catalyst (e.g. acidic ion-exchange resin Amberlyst 15) while removing formed water for the preparation of 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone.<br>
A journal article in. the Clean Techn. Environ Policy 4 (2002) pg. 157 - 164 also describes method to prepare 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone from resorcinol and acetic acid in the presence of variety of solid acid catalysts like montmorillonite clay (K-10),<br><br><br>
decatungstophosphoric acid suported on K-10, sulfated zirconia and ion-exchange resins like Amberlyst-36. The catalyst concentration used in this work is very low.<br>
Indian Journal of Chemistry Vol. 21 B (1982) pp. 963 -964 and Indian Journal of Chemistry Vol. 25 B (1986) pp. 515 -516 both describe a method of preparing 4,6-diacetyl resorcinol by the reaction of resorcinol with acetic anhydride in the presence of zinc chloride.<br>
Many of the above prior art publications report reaction of resorcinol with acetic acid to prepare compounds other than that of formula 1. Some compounds of formula 1 viz. 4,6- diacetyl resorcinol have been prepared from resorcinol and acetic anhydride using zinc chloride catalyst. Acetic anhydride is very difficult to purchase in many countries due to very strict government regulations on its procurement, storage and use. There is still a need felt in the art to prepare compounds of formula 1 using more easily and economically available compounds. The present inventors have found that resorcinol when reacted with readily available organic carboxylic acids in the presence of an acidic catalyst, Where maintainance of "specific catalyst : reactant ratios produce the compounds of formula 1 of high yield and purity.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to prepare compound of the formula 1,<br><br><br>
Where R is a group chosen from alkyl or aryl, either cyclic or acyclic, either unsubstituted or substituted (branched) and may have heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen or sulpher).<br>
 It is a further object of the present invention to prepare compound of formula 1 of high yields and purity in a single step reaction thus requiring only a single reaction vessel.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to prepare compound of formula 1 that uses chemicals/ raw materials which are readily available at economical price.<br>
It is a yet another object of the present invention to prepare compound of formula 1 that uses chemicals/ raw materials which are readily available at economical price and creates a minimal amount of bi-products which are also easy to separate and environmentally friendly.<br>

art could be employed to first prepare resorcinol, following which the process of the invention could be carried out.<br>
Suitable organic carboxylic acid which is used for the reaction may be aliphatic or aromatic. The carboxylic acid could be straight chain or in branched  configuration. The carboxylic acid could also have a heteroatom like oxygen, nitrogen or sulpher. Preferred carboxylic acids, as perthis invention are aliphatic in nature and have carbon chain lengths of 1 to16 more preferably 1 to 8. The preferred concentration of the   carboxylic acid is such that the mole ratio of the carboxylic acid to the resorcinol used is at least 2 preferably at least 4.<br>
The reaction has to be carried out in the presence of an acidic catalyst. The acid<br>
catalyst is chosen from Lewis acid or Bronsted acid catalysts.
