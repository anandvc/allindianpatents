				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an insulation layer for cables, in particular insu-<br>
lation layers comprising a heterophasic polymer composition haying superior<br>
mechanical and electrical properties and being environmental friendly. More-<br>
over, the present invention is related to a process for producing the insulation<br>
layer as well as to a use of the insulation layer. Further, the invention is also re-<br>
lated to a cable comprising the inventive insulation layer as well as to a process<br>
for the manufacture of the cable comprising the inventive insulation layer.<br>
Nowadays, ethylene polymer products are used as insulatioon- and semi-<br>
conducting shields for low, medium and high voltage cables, respectively, due to<br>
easy processability and their beneficial electrical properties. In addition, in low<br>
voltage applications polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is also commonly lised as insula-<br>
tion material, usually in combination with softeners to reach desirable softness<br>
of cables. A draw back with PVC is the restricted operation temperature of 70 °C<br>
by standardization. This has to be seen in relation to the fact that PVC has a re-<br>
stricted mechanical performance at elevated temperatures. In addition, softeners<br>
!<br>
have to be added to PVC in order to maintain a high level of flexibility. Insuffi-<br>
cient amounts of softeners reduce low temperature properties of PVC signifi-<br>
cantly. From an environmental point of view, these softeners are hot always re-<br>
garded as problem-free, making them desirable to eliminate.<br>
Cables comprising polyethylene layers are commonly operated at 70 °C. How-<br>
ever, there is a need of higher operating temperatures, which then! require cross-<br>
linking of the polyethylene, otherwise the polyethylene would soften or even<br>
melt Hence, in the cable sector, the coating surrounding the conductor com-<br><br><br>
monly consists of cross-linked polyethylene materials to give a satisfactory me-<br>
chanical performance even under heating in continuous use and under conditions<br>
of current overload while at the same time maintaining a high level of flexibility.<br>
On the other hand, a disadvantage of these products is that cross-linked products<br>
are hard to recycle. Moreover, in some cases the outer-protective sheet consists<br>
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is difficult to separate by conventional meth-<br>
ods from the cross-linked polyolefins containing inorganic fillers. When the ca-<br><br>
ble has reached the end of its operational lifetime, the whole cable has to be dis-<br>
posed and, in case of combustion, highly toxic chlorinated products are gener-<br>
ated.<br>
In the case of peroxide curing of cables the cross-linking stage itself is a limiting<br>
factor in terms of line speed. Moreover, in processing such cables by extrusion,<br>
it is important that cross-linking does not occur until the mixture has left the ex-<br>
!<br>
tnider, since premature cross-linking or scorch makes it impossible to maintain a<br>
uniform production capacity, and furthermore the quality of the resulting product<br>
will be unsatisfactory. Cross-linking or pre-curing within the extruder causes<br>
gelation and adhesion of the polymer gel to surfaces of the egum-menf, with<br>
consequent risk of plugging.<br>
For the above given reason, there is a need for new layer compositions which<br>
allow a higher operating temperature than polyethylene or PVC materials, pref-<br>
erably an operating temperature of at least 90 °C. Moreover, the new insulation<br><br>
layer shall reduce the scorch phenomenon also allowing a high exirusion speed.<br>
Moreover, the mechanical properties shall be improved in particular the impact<br>
strength and tensile strength.<br>
EP 0 893 801 Al discloses propylene polymer components suitable as insulation<br>
sheet material. It particularly discloses a composition of a crystalline propylene<br>
homopolymer or copolymer mixed with a copolymer of ethylene with an a-<br><br>
olefin having a low density and a high structural uniformity, in particular having a highly<br>
homogeneous distribution of the a-olefinbetween the polymer molecules. However, EP 0 893<br>
801 Al does not disclose a possibility having an insulation layer suitable for high temperature<br>
operation conditions, simultaneously having very good mechanical properties.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an insulation layer for cables comprising a<br>
composite, whereby the composite comprises a heterophasic polymer composition<br>
comprising: a polypropylene matrix having a melting enthalpy of 25 to 70 J/g at a temperature<br>
range of 135 to 170°C measured according to DSC-ISO 11357 and dispersed therein, a<br>
propylene copolymer having a weight average particle size of less than 1 urn, and a melting<br>
enthalpy of 0.5 to 75 J/g at a temperature range of 10 to 130°C measured according to DSC-<br>
ISO 11357.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for producing an insulation layer,<br>
wherein a polypropylene matrix is produced in one or more slurry reactors and optionally one<br>
or more gas phase reactors followed by producing a propylene copolymer in the 10 gas phase<br>
and, optionally, adding polyethylene by blending or in situ polymerization of ethylene in the<br>
reactor system.<br><br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an environmental<br>
friendly insulation layer allowing an operation temperature of at least 90 °C and<br>
j<br>
simultaneously having enhanced mechanical properties in particular a high im-<br>
pact strength and a good tensile strength.<br>
The present invention is based in the finding that this object can be solved by an<br>
insulation layer for cables comprising an heterophasic polymer composition<br>
comprising a propylene copolymer having a specific particle size.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides an insulation layer for dables compris-<br>
ing a composite, whereby the composite comprises a heterophasic1 polymer com-<br>
position (A) comprising<br>
a polypropylene matrix (1) and dispersed therein<br>
a propylene copolymer (2) having a weight average particle size; of less than 1<br>
urn, more preferably less than 0,9 pm and most preferably less thaji 0,8 um.<br>
Such an insulation layer is not only environmental friendly but also allows op-<br>
eration temperatures for cables of at least 90 °C. This is due to relatively high<br>
elastic modulus exhibited by the composite at elevated temperatures of relevance<br>
compared to high density polyethylene (HDPE), PVC and cross-linked low. den-<br>
sity polyethylene. Moreover, this insulation layer has attractive mechanical<br>
properties in terms of e.g. a suitable balance between impact strength and flex-<br>
ural modulus.<br><br><br>
Heterophasic polymer compositions according to this invention are compositions<br>
comprising a propylene matrix in which a copolymer is dispersed having a lower<br>
structural order than the matrix.<br>
Important for the present invention is that the propylene copolymer (2) has a<br>
particle size of at least less than 1 urn. This particle size allows a good particle<br>
distribution in the matrix and influences the impact strength of the insulation<br>
layer positively. Moreover, a low average particle size decreased the risk of<br>
crazes being initiated by these particles while improving the possibility of said<br>
particles to stop already formed crazes or cracks. The particle size distribution of<br>
the propylene copolymer (2) in the polypropylene matrix (1) can b!e determined<br>
by suitable microscopic methods. Examples for such methods are j atomic force<br>
i<br>
microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission elec-<br>
tron microscopy (TEM). Etching and/or staining of the specimeni is normally<br>
required to achieve the necessary resolution and clarity of images. Examples for<br>
i<br>
the determination of the particle size distribution and the calculation of the<br>
weight average particle size there from can be found in the literatuie. A suitable<br>
method involving SEM on specimens stained with R.UO4 is described in Polt et<br>
al. JAppl.Polym.Sci. 78 (2000) 1152-61. This SEM has been used to determine<br>
the weight average particle size in the present invention.<br>
It is preferred that the content of the composite as defined above and further de-<br>
j<br>
fined in the following is in the insulation layer at least 90 wt-%, more preferred<br>
95 wt-%.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred that the composite is a thermoplastic polyolefin compo-<br>
sition. Under "thermoplastic material" a material is understood which is capable<br>
j<br>
of being repeatedly melted by increasing temperature and solidified by decreas-<br>
ing temperature. Thermoplastic materials are those materials the change of<br>
which upon heating is substantially physical rather than chemical. They are<br>
largely two- or one-dimensional molecule structures.<br><br><br>
The molecular weight can be characterized by the way of its melt flow rate<br>
(MFR) according to ISO 1133 at 230 °C. The melt flow rate is mainly de-<br>
I<br>
pending on the average molecular weight. This is because of the fact that<br>
long molecules give the material a lower flow tendency thai short mole-<br>
cules.<br>
An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the MIjR-value. The<br>
melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polympr discharged<br>
through a defined die under specified temperature and pressure conditions<br>
and is a measure of the viscosity of the polymer which in tairn for each<br>
type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight, but also by<br>
its degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16<br>
kg (ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the composite has an MFR2<br>
(measured according to ISO 1133) of 0,5 to 50 g/10 min, more preferred of<br>
0,55 to 20 g/10 min, most preferred 0,5 to 8 g/lOmin. Moreover, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the composite is a thermoplastic polyolefin composition having<br>
an MFR2 of 0,5 to 50 g/10 min, more preferably of 0,55 to!20 g/10 min,<br>
most preferably of 0,5 to 8 g/lOmin.<br>
It is further preferred that the density of composite has to pe in a given<br>
range. The density has influence on the property of the insulation layer<br>
such as impact strength and shrinkage characteristics. Additionally, the<br>
optimum dispersion of possible additives in the composite is dependent on<br>
the right choice of the density. For this reason, a balance between these<br>
properties should be established. For the inventive insulation layer the<br>
composite has preferably a density range between 0.89-0.95 g/cm and<br>
more preferably of 0.90-0.93 g/cm3. The density has been measured ac-<br>
cording to ISO 11883.<br><br><br>
In order to achieve a good balance of the properties in the insolation layer,<br>
the amount of propylene matrix (1) and the amount of the propylene co-<br>
polymer (2) dispersed in the matrix (1) is of importance. The matrix gives<br>
the insulation layer the stiffness and tensile strength whereas the propylene<br>
copolymer (2) improves the impact strength. Hence, it is preferred that the<br>
composition (A) comprises 50-90 wt-% of the polypropylene matrix (1),<br>
more preferred 55-85 wt-% and most preferred 60-80 wt-%.<br>
On the other hand, as stated above, the amount and particle size of the pro-<br>
i<br>
f<br>
pylcne copolymer (2) has a positive influence on the impact strength. It is<br>
therefore preferred that the composition (A) comprises 10-50 Wt-% of the<br>
propylene copolymer (2) dispersed in the propylene matrix (li), more pre-<br>
ferred 15-45 wt-% and most preferred 20-40 wt-%.<br>
Optionally the propylene copolymer (2) may also include crystalline poly-<br>
ethylene but not more than 10 wt%, more preferably 5 wt% and most pref-<br>
erably 2 vvt% of the total propylene copolymer (2).<br>
Heterophasic polymer compositions normally comprise a matrix (1) in<br>
which a further polymer component is dispersed. Thereby, the matrix (1)<br>
can be of a homopolymer or copolymer nature.<br>
The term "homopolymer" used herein refers to isotactic polypropylene that<br>
substantially, i.e. to at least 98 wt%, consists of propylene units. Preferably<br>
this homopolymer consists of 99 wt%, more preferably of 9i9,5 wt% of<br>
propylene units<br>
However, in the present invention it is preferred that the matrix (1) is a<br>
propylene copolymer and more preferably a random propylene cjopolymer.<br>
A random copolymer is a copolymer consisting of alternating sequences of<br>
i<br>
two monomelic units of random length (including shiglt! molecules).<br><br><br>
Hence, according to this definition it is preferred that the rahdom propyl-<br>
ene copolymer comprises at least one comonomer selected from the group<br>
consisting of ethylene and C4-C2 a-olefin. Preferred C4-C8 a-olefins are 1-<br>
butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, l-heptene!or 1-octene,<br>
more preferred 1-butene. The most preferred random propylene copolymer<br>
consists of propylene and ethylene.<br>
Preferably the comonomer content of the polypropylene matrix (1) is 0.5-<br>
10 wt-%, more preferably 1-8 wt-% and most preferred 2-6 wt-%.<br>
The incorporation of the comonomer reduces both the meltihg point and<br>
the crystallinity of the polypropylene matrix, the latter becoming effective<br>
in a reduction of the melting enthalpy as determined in DSCI (ISO 3146).<br>
In case of ethylene as a comonomer, the melting points of sAch polymers<br>
are preferably in the range of 120 to 162°C, more preferably 130 to 160<br>
°C, while the melting enthalpies are in the range of preferably: 40 to 95 J/g,<br>
more preferably 60 to 90 J/g.<br>
For combining optimum processability with the required mechanical prop-<br>
erties the incorporation of the comonomer can be controlled in such a way<br>
that one part of the polypropylene contains more comonomer than the<br>
other. To ensure suitability for the purpose of this patent these intrapoly-<br>
meric differences in comonomer content must not exceed a( level which<br>
still allows full miscibility of all parts of the polymer. Suitably polypropyl-<br>
enes are described e.g. in WO 03/002652 (Propylene Random Copolymer<br>
and Process for the Production thereof) and are herewith incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
It is in particular preferred that the propylene copolymer (2) as defined<br>
above is substantially amorphous. Amorphous copolymers,! in technical<br>
i<br>
terms normally called "rubbers", are especially suitable for improving the<br><br><br>
impact strength and flexibility of the insulation layer when incorporated<br>
into the polypropylene matrix (1). A polymer is amorphous whjen it has no<br>
definite order or crystalline structure, expressed in a lack of rhelting point<br>
and enthalpy when investigated by DSC. The term "substantially amor-<br>
phous" means that the propylene copolymer can have residual crystallinity<br>
below a level corresponding to a melting enthalpy of 10 J/g.<br>
Preferably the propylene copolymer (2) dispersed in the polypropylene ma-<br>
trix (1) comprises at least one comonomer selected from the grOup consist-<br>
ing of ethylene and C*-C% a-olefin. Preferred Q-Cg a-olefins aire 1-butene,<br>
1-pentene, 4-methyl-l'-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene or 1-octene, more pre-<br>
ferred is 1-butene. The most preferred substantially amorphoujs propylene<br>
copolymer (2) is a so-called "ethylene-propylene rubber" (EPlt), compris-<br>
ing 30-70 wt% ethylene units and 70-30 wt% propylene units. Optionally<br>
i<br>
this copolymer can also contain diene units and is then technically denoted<br>
as "ethylene-propylene diene rubber" (EPDM). While the EPRican be both<br>
produced either directly in one step of the polymerization of ihe polypro-<br>
pylene or added as a separate component in a subsequent melt mixing or<br>
blending step, the EPDM can only be added in a subsequent melt mixing or<br>
blending step.<br>
Preferably the comonomer content of the propylene comonomer (2) is 20-<br>
80 wt-%, more preferably 30-70 wt-% and most preferred 60-65'wt-%.<br>
Beside the heterophasic polymer composition (A) the composite can com-<br>
prise preferably in addition a polyethylene (B). With such a polyethylene<br>
(B), the mechanical properties can be further adapted to the environmental<br>
circumstances, i.e. if a further improvement of impact strength, softness or<br>
resistance to stress whitening (blush) is required, this can be kchieved by<br>
incorporating a suitable polyethylene (B). The modulus of the polyethylene<br>
added should be lower than the modulus of the polypropylene matrix (1) to<br><br><br><br>
low density<br>
process. For<br>
ensure a positive influence. It is preferred that a polyethylene!' of density of<br>
930 kg/m3 or less is used, including both low density poly ethylenes (PE-<br>
LD) being produced in a high pressure process and linear!<br>
polyefhylenes (PE-LLD) being produced in a low pressure;<br>
i<br>
cable insulation compositions the low ash content of PE-LD resulting from<br>
the absence of catalyst in the polymerisation process can be Ian additional<br>
advantage.<br>
*D~<br>
Moreover, by adding the polyethylene (B) as defined above to me compos-<br>
ite comprising the heterophasic polymer composition (A) the hkpact strength<br>
is improved as can be seen by the higher values measured by the Charpy im-<br>
pact test. This test is a destructive test of impact resistance jconsisting of<br>
placing the optionally notched specimen in a horizontal position between<br>
two supports and applying a strike of known intensity, which will normally<br>
fracture the specimen. The energy uptake (damping) in this fracturing<br>
process is recorded as a measure of impact strength.<br>
Preferred polyefhylenes used for modifying the insulation; composition<br>
have a density of 910 to 930 kg/m3. In a low density polyethylene (PE-<br>
LD), the reduced crystallinity and density results from a random branching<br>
i<br>
structure of the polymer molecules, while in a linear low density polyeth-<br>
ylene (PE-LLD) higher a-olefrns like 1-butene, 1-hexene of 1-octene as<br>
comonomers are used to achieve an analogous effect. The rejsulting mate-<br>
rial is relatively soft, flexible and tough and will withstand moderate heat.<br>
Preferably the polyethylene (B) is present in an amount of 0 to 5_ 0 wt-%, more<br>
preferably 20 to 45 wt-% and most preferably between 30 tq 40 wt-?/o. In<br>
addition, it is preferred that when polyethylene (B) is incorporated into the<br>
composite at least 20 % of composition (A) is present in the composite.<br><br><br>
More preferred, composition (A) ranges from 80 to 55 wt-% and most pre-<br>
ferred 70 to 60 wt-%.<br>
Preferably the fraction of the polypropylene matrix (1) present! in the insu-<br>
lation composition has a melting enthalpy of 25 to 70 J/g at a rhelting tem-<br>
i<br>
perature of 130 to 170°C. Moreover, it is preferred that the residual crys-<br>
talline fraction of the propylene copolymer (2) and/or the polyethylene (B)<br>
j<br>
has a melting enthalpy of 0,5 to 75 J/g at a melting temperature of 100 to<br>
130°C. The melting of the insulation composition must take place at tem-<br>
peratures above 100°C to ensure sufficient resistance to ambient tempera-<br>
tures and resistive heating.<br>
The flexural modulus is the ratio, within the elastic limit, of the applied<br>
stress on a test specimen in flexure, to the corresponding strain in the out-<br>
ermost fibers of the specimen. For insulation layers for cables it is appreci-<br>
ated if the flexural modulus measured according to ISO 178 does not ex-<br>
ceed 1000 MP a, more preferably 700 MPa, still more preferably ranges<br>
from 250-650 MPa, yet more preferably from 300-600 MPa anil most pref-<br>
i<br>
erably from 340-530 MPa. Furthermore, it is preferred that the above de-<br>
scribed insulation polymer has a tensile modulus ranging from 300-600 MPa,<br>
more preferred 350-550 MPa. The tensile modulus has been determined accord-<br>
ing to ISO 178.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred that the elongation at break according to ISO 527<br>
be at least 200 %, more preferably ranges from 250-550 %, still more pref-<br>
erably from 350-530 % and most preferably from 370-490 °/o. It is most<br><br>
preferred that the properties expressed by flexural modulus<br><br>
and tensile<br><br>
modulus as well as by the elongation at break are fulfilled simultaneously.<br>
The Charpy impact strength is a destructive test of impact resistance con-<br>
sisting of placing the optionally notched specimen in a horizontal position<br><br><br>
between two supports and applying a strike of known intensify, which will<br>
normally fracture the specimen. The energy uptake (dampingj) in this frac-<br>
turing process is recorded as a measure of impact strength.: The Charpy<br>
impact has been measured according to ISO 179 leA (23 °Cj) and accord-<br>
ing to ISO 179 leA (-20 °C). It is preferred that the values measured at 23<br>
°C for the Charpy impact test ranges from 50-100 kJ/m2, mdre preferably<br>
from 55-96 kJ/m2 and most preferred from 80-95 kJ/m2. In aiddition, pref-<br>
erably the values measured at"-20 °C according to ISO 179 leA ranges<br>
from 2-15 kJ/m2, more preferably from 8-14 kJ/m2. In addition, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the impact strength properties measured according to ISO 179<br>
are simultaneously fulfilled with the properties expressed by the flexural<br>
modulus, tensile modulus and elongation at break.<br>
Moreover, the present invention also comprises a process for producing the<br>
inventive insulation whereby the polypropylene matrix (1) is produced in<br>
one or more slurry reactors and optionally one or more gas phase reactors<br>
followed by producing a propylene copolymer (2) in the gas phase and op-<br>
tionally adding polyethylene (B) by blending or in-situ polymerization of<br>
ethylene in the reactor system. Subsequently, to the additives can further<br>
on be added heterophasic polymer composition (A) by any kind of blend-<br>
ing or mixing operation.<br>
The slurry phase polymerization can be carried out at temperatures of<br>
lower than 75 °C, preferably 60-65 °C and pressure varying bjetween 60-90<br>
bar, preferably 3 0-70 bar. The polymerization is preferably carried out un-<br>
der such conditions that 20-90 wt-%, preferably 40-80 wt-% fironi the polymers<br>
are polymerized in the slurry reactors. The residence time can be between 15-20<br>
minutes.<br><br><br>
The gas phase polymerization step is carried out preferably by transferring the<br>
reaction mixture from the slurry phase directly to the gas phase without remov-<br>
ing unreacted monomers, more preferably by a pressure of higher j than 10 bar.<br>
i<br>
The reaction temperature used will generally be within the range of 60-115 °C,<br>
more preferably 70-110 °C. The reaction pressure will be preferably higher than<br>
5 bar and more preferably be in the range of 10-25 bar, and the residents time<br>
will preferably be 0.1-5 hours.<br>
Preferably a loop reactor is used as said slurry reactor although the ireactor types<br>
such as a tank reactor could also be employed. According to another embodi-<br>
ment, the slurry phase is carried out in two slurry reactors preferably but not<br>
necessarily in two loop reactors. By doing so the comonomer; distribution<br>
can easily be controlled. "When continuing the copolymerization in the gas<br>
phase reactor or reactors, the comonomer content can be increased further.<br>
Thus, the matrix polymer can be tailored by adjusting comonomer ratios in<br>
different reactors.<br>
Polymerization may be achieved by using any standard olefin polymeriza-<br>
tion catalyst and these are well known to the person skilled in jthe art. Pre-<br>
ferred catalyst systems comprise an ordinary stereo-specific Ziegler-Natta-<br>
catalyst, metallocene catalyst and other organo-metalliG or coordination<br>
catalysts. A particularly preferred catalyst system is a high yield Ziegler-<br>
Natta-catalyst having a catalyst component, a co-catalyst component, op-<br>
tionally an external donor. The catalyst system may thus contain a titanium<br>
s<br>
component and an electron/donor compound supported on an activated<br>
magnesium dichloride, a trialkylaluminum compound as an aictivator and<br>
an electron/donor compound. A further preferred catalyst system is a met-<br>
allocene catalyst having a bridged structure giving a high stereo activity<br>
and which is an active complex impregnated on a carrier. Suitable catalyst<br><br><br>
systems are described in for example FI 88047, EP 491566, E? 586390 and<br>
WO 98/12234 which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
