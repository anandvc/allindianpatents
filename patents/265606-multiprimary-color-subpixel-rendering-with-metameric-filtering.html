MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0034) In multiprimaiy &amp; RGBW displays and their associated systems, it is sometimes needed to convert traditional RGB image data into multiprimary image data. Many techniques of Gamut Mapping Algorithms (GMA) are well known in the art and are also discussed in several of the above listed applications that are herein incorporated by reference. In many of the applications incorporated by reference, there are numerous novel subpixel repeating puups that comprise multiprimary displays. Figures 2 through 10 show a representative sampling of these novel subpixel repeating patterns that are further discussed in the aforementioned patent applications and issued patents. The techniques of the present application apply to these exemplary subpixel repeating patterns and others — either known or unimown — that would allow for different metmners to be selected within a region that may be substantially undistinguishable by the human eye as viewed at normal operating distances<br><br>
[0035] When four or more non-coincident color primaries are used in a display, commonly called a "inultiprimary" display in the art, there are often multiple combinations of values for the primaries that may give the same color value. That is to~y' for a given hue, saturation, and brightness, there may be more than one set of intensity values of the four or more primaries that may give the same color impression to a human viewer. Each such possible intensity value set is called a "metamer" for said color. Thus, a metainer on a subpixelated displays is a combination (or a set) of at least two groups of colored subpixels such that there exists signals that, when applied to each such group, yields a desired color that is perceived by the Human Vision System. Of course, such a signal may vary from group of subpixels to group, in ouxter to produce the same or substantially similar perceived color. Because of this, a degree of freedom exists to adjust relative values of the primaries for some effect<br><br>
[0036] For example, in US Patent 6,536,904 to Kunzman teaches a method of reducing the visibility of field sequential color break-up by maximizing the intensity of the achromatic (i.e. white) primary of a four primary, RGBW projector. Also, US Patent 6,885,380 to Primerano et al. teaches a similar choice of maximizing the white primary of<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

RGBW displays using different methods for the goal of reducing power in Organic Light Emitting Diode. US Patents 6,536,904 and 6,885,380 are herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
[0037] Thus, metamer selection for a color subpixelated multi-primary display system, as a degree of freedom, offers several novel opportunities to transform and present data at a subpixel level. For merely one example, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the intensity value of the primary of a subpixel may be adjusted by the value of the relative luminance signal of the image being rendered at that subpixel point compared with its neighbors. In this fashion, the metamers may be adjusted to facilitate and improve the quality of the unage rendering at the color subpixel level, thus improving the art of"subpixel rendering~.<br><br>
[0038] In general for metamers, any given color and brightness may be also realized by another set of intensity values of colored subpixels in the local area. For example, in an RGBW system, a W subpixel is a metanier for grey with a nearby group of R, G, and B subpixels. Of courac, the subpixels that arc used for creating a given color maybe any nearby subpixels that are close enough that the Human Vision System will blend the colors together. These degrees of freedom -- choosing signal values from among similar color subpixels coupled with the degree of freedom afforded by choosing among metamers, and thus signal values among different sets of color subpixels — allow the luminance component of a given image to be represented possibly with greater fidelity at the subpixel level while maintaining the correct brightness and color at a global (or perceptual) level.<br><br>
[0039] For subpixel rendered images, metamer choices represent a potential opportunity to select a possibly desired metamer (maybe from a set of suitable metamers) that reduces possible errors between the desired and actual image displayed. RGBW systems are one example of display systems that may take advantage of these degrees of freedom. The metamers for RGBW systems may be found on a White vs. RGB axis. So, for merely one example, it may be possible to construct a filter that measures the high spatial frequency luminance sign.al at a given pixel mapped to a given subpixel and use it to concentrate the enei~' of the luminance signal onto the color that will be at that subpixel position aller suhpixel rendering. Using the luminance (i.e."L") values - e.g. from the ROB to RGBWL gamut mapping operation disclosed in the above listed disclosures, it is possible to evaluate<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
II<br><br><br>
the amount of intensity that should be in the White vs. the ROB values based on the pixel location.<br><br>
[0040] FIgure lA shows a system level diagram lOOa of one embodiment of the display system that employs techniques discussed further herein. Display system tOGa comprises a "pipeline" that accepts input pixel values and produces output for a multi-primary display. Most calculations in the pipeline may be done on linear color values, so an input gamma conversion and an output gamma conversion, although optional, may be desired. The input pixels may consist of 3 primary colors such as RGB or YCbCr that may be converted to muiti-primary in GMA module 102. Gamut mapping algorithms are known in the art and indeed such techniques are described in many of the herein above referenced patent applications. In such systems, it is possible that the OMA module may also calculate the luminance channel, L. of the input image data signal — in addition to the other multi-primary signals.<br><br>
[0041] It will bc appreciated that the tcchniques discussed in the present application are also applicable in situations where the number of input primary colors is N and the number of output primary colors is M and (1) N is less than M; (2) N equals M, particularly where N=M&gt; 3; or (3) N is greater than M, particularly in a system that downsamples the color space. In addition, these techniques are applicable in any color space mapping in which metamen exist within the output color space. In some systems, it may be desirable to map from a first multiprimary space into itself In such a case, the techniques described herein are applicable as long as there are metamers in the color space. It should be appreciated that, in such cases, the need for a GMA is optional.<br><br>
[0042] As will be discussed in further detail below, in one embodiment, the metameric calculations may be implemented as a filtering operation— referencing a plurality of surrounding image data (e.g. pixel or subpixel) values. These surrounding values are typically organized by a line buffer module 104, although other embodiments are possible, such as multiple frame buffers. This embodiment further comprises a metamer filtering module 106 which performs operations that will be described below. In one embodiment, it is possible for the metamer filtering to share the line buffers with sub-pixel rendering (SPR) module 108. For purposes of the present discussion, whenever the metamer filtering is combined with SPR in a manner similar to this, it is called "direct metamer filtering".<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
12<br><br><br>
[0043] In another embodiment of a display system that operates according to the techniques disclosed herein, shown in Figure lB, display system lOOb comprises several of the same modules as display system lOOa. GMA module 102 may be included to map incoming image data from one color space to another. In this embodiment, the metamer filtering (at block 106) may be accomplished in a separate pass over the pixel data. For purposes of the present discussion, this processing is called "preconditioning metamer filtering". In this case, SPR module 108 may require a separate frame buffer or line buffer 107 apart from any memory or buffer 104 used by metamer filtering module 106.<br><br>
[0044] Also, it may be possible to pre-select metamers of the input colors in metamer select module 101, as is described in an above incorporated by reference patent application. This Inetamer selection may be done on each pixel individually without filtering and thus may not require a line buffer or frame buffer.<br><br>
[0045] Additionally, in Figure lB, metamer filtering module 106 is shown downstream on the display pipeline from the GMA module 102. This is one embodiment but other locations of the two modules maybe advantageous. For example, the GMA module 102 may include a gamut clamping function as described in one of the above incorporated by reference patent applications. It may be advantageous to move the gamut clamping function after metamer filtering module 106. If colors are allowed to stay out-of-gamut until after module 106, the metamer filtering may bring some colors back into gamut and remove the necessity of clamping them, resulting in better color reproduction.<br><br>
[0046] Without regard to the particular modules or subsystems involved in the hanlware, FIgure 13 provides a high level flowchart of the processes and teelmiques disclosed herein. A display system inputs image data (1302) and fiDin the input data, the system extracts luminance information (1304). Of course, such information may already available to the system, if it is supplied by the external source or, if it is calculated via the GMA or other subsystem in the hardware. Such techniques for calculating luminance from image data is weU known and several are disclosed in many applications incorporated above.<br><br>
[0047] It will be appreciated that, while it is possible that the system calculates luminance data from the input image data, it is also possible to employ other data (e.g green and/or red intensity/brightness values) that gives the system some indication of how the input image data is varying in the mid-to-high spatial frequency domain Approximating luminance<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
13<br><br><br>
data from such high brightness subpixels — e.g. red and/or green or other colored subpixels (perhaps with a broad band pass) may be suitable.<br><br>
[0048] The luminance data is input into a metamer filter (1306) and the output is an adjustment value which is then used as input to adjust or map image data (for example, adjusting intensity values or other suitable values) from one metamer to another metamer according to the adjustment value. One embodiment of the adjustment value might be a sharpness value as given in step 1308 of Figure 13— of course, other adjustment values are possible. The resulting image data may then be output (1310). The adjustment value, as described herein, may preferably be a value that allows adjustment of subpixel intensities (across metamers) without substantially changing the perceived color or intensity of the image. As described herein, one embodiment of the adjustment value embodies a linear relationship between metamer values; however, it will be appreciated that the adjustment value, as such. may embody other relationships (e.g. non-linear, functional or non-functional, etc.) that allow for the adjustment of subpixel intensity values across metamers as desired. The scope of the claims attached below properly encompasses these other obvious relationships.<br><br>
[0049] It will also be appreciated that the manner of metamer filtering has, as one embodiment described herein, several 3x3 filter masks that employ Difference of Gaussian (DOG) and/or area resampling filters. It will be appreciated that many other filter masks are possible (e.g. dimensions other than 3x3; or diagonal mask entries as opposed to row and column, or orthogonal entries). In fact, it suffices, for the purpose of implementing display systems and methods that employ the techniques discussed herein, to have some unit that detects or calculates or infers spatial frequency data or variations therein and produces some characteristic - e.g. a value or a function that reflects upon what is being detected. Tbat characteristic may then be used by a unit or module that would then calculate or select image data from a metamer set based upon the characteristic. Many systems and methods of detecting. calculating or inferring spatial frequency variation exist and are known - e.g. filters, adaptive filters, edge detector, flat field detector, blurring filter, and transform detector (e.g. Fourier, wavelet, DCT and the like).<br><br>
[0050] For purposes of successfully carrying out the techniques discussed herein, it is sufficient that, fur whatever filter mask selected, some alteration is accomplished that alters or<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
14<br><br><br>
selects the subpixel intensity values in the image data to the desired effect The effect of the adjustment value may be to sharpen regions of high spatial frequency (e.g. text or the like). Alternatively, there may be other reasons to alter subpixel intensity values across metamers for other reasons — perhaps to smooth out certain image features (e.g. possibly under a dynamic adaptive filtering condition). The scope of the attached claims similarly encompasses these variants.<br><br>
[0051] In addition, it is possible to apply luminance data to the image data in manners other than filtering. Other functional relationships for producing an adjustment —either calculated or approximated - is within the scope of the attached claims. It may also be sufficient that intensity values of subpixels comprising approximate metamers be adjusted according to some relationship based upon the luminance data. The adjusted image data may then output to a display.<br><br>
[0052] As an additional embodiment, it is po~sible to introduce random noise to select among equivalent metamers to create a dither system to improve grey scale performance or to reduce quantization error. For example, the 'a' value described herein may represent or include such a noise signal. Such techniques to introduce noise are known in the art and several are detailed in many of the applications incorporated above.<br><br><br>
Calculating Metauners<br><br>
[0053] It is possible to model the dynamic relationships between metamer subpixel groups and associated signals. For example, it is possible to find linear relationships between the metamers and signals of any particular color - to allow calculating "nearby" metamers and signals. Such a model could be used to adjust intensity values of subpixels comprising a metamer in a manner so as to minimize image artifacts and errors — such as color error or the like, From such a model, intensity adjustment values may be stored in a display system and employed whenever there is a need to adjust image data in according with certain data, such as luminance data as mentioned above.<br><br>
[0054] For example, when one of the primaries in a metamer is changed by an amount "a", one might change each of the other primaries by an amount ~a*m'$ — where the 'metamer slope' term "in" may be different for each of the primaries. As will be discussed further, these slope terms may be calculated from the matrix M2X that converts colors from<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
15<br><br><br>
the multi-primary system into CIE XYZ co-ordinates. It is known in the art to calculate this conversion matrix from measurements of the chromaticity and luminosity of the primaries of a multi-primary system — indeed, there are several such conversion matrices discussed in copending and co-owned United States Patent Applications 2005/0083341 and 2005/0083352 which are incorporated by reference.<br><br>
[0055] In the case of a multi-primary system with only four primaries, it is possible to directly determine the slope terms for calculating metamers. There are several useful display layouts mentioned in the patent applications that have been incorporated by reference above. They are also included here for convenience. Two examples are a high brightness RGBW (with repeating subpixel group 320 comprising red 306, green 308, blue 310 and white 304 subpi.xels) shown in Figures 3,4, and SA and a wide gamut RGBC (with repeating subpixel group 802 comprising red 806, green 808, blue 810, and cyan 804 subpixels) display shown in Figure 8. The method described below will use RGBC as an example, but the process works with RGBW or any other four primary display system.<br><br><br>

[0056) Equation 100 states a linear assumption: If one starts with some arbitrary RGBC color (r g b c], add a small number 'a' times the set of metamer slope values (mr mg mbmc] and thenconverttoClE XYZ with the M2X matrix, onewill getthe sameClE XYZ color after converting the original arbitrary color directly to OlE XYZ. The following process will calculate these metamer slope values. Equation 100 can be simplified by distribution, subtracting common terms from both sides, and dividing both sides by 'a' with the result in Equation 101. Inthecase of a four primary system, the M2X matrix maybe a4x3 matrix as shown in Equation 102 with the constant values Mrx, Mgx, etc.<br><br>
[0057] In merely one enibodiment, in order to find them slope values, one might start by arbitrarily setting one of them slope values to I (or some other convenient value) as<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

shown in Equation 101. This is shown in Equation 103 with the M2X matrix expanded from Equation 102.<br><br>

[0058) Because one of the slopes (the mc slope for cyan) has been set to one (1), this may result in a column of constants in the result which can be subtracted from both sides. This is done in Equation 104. The remaining matrix on the left is square and them slope values can be calculated by invezling the matrix and multiplying both sides by the result, as shown in Equation 105. It should be noted that other values besides one (I) will have a similar effect of producing a constant column.<br><br>

Equation 105<br>
[0059] This calculates the values of mr, mg. and nib when mc is one (I). When the cyan primary of a color is changed by an amount 'a', the other primaries should be changed by a"mr, a*mg and a*mb to create a metamer of the original color. It is possible to repeat the above procedure while arbitrarily setting a different slope constant to one (I), subtracting a different constant column from both sides, and solving for the remaining variables. Alternately, one may calculate them slope values once as above, and then divide the set of slopes by each of the calculated slopes in turn to generate the set of slopes for each starting primary. An example of the M2X matrix for a test RGBC display is sho~i below with them slope values for each primary as calculated by the above procedure.<br>

[0060) Matrix 106 above is an example calculated from primary calorimetry and luminosity readings of a theoretical RGBC display. Matrix 107 is a table of metamer slope values to use when one knows how much one wishes to change red and needs to calculate how much to change the others. Matrix 108 shows how much to change the others when green is changed, Matrix 109 is when blue is changed and Matrix 110 is for when cyan is changecL<br><br>
[0061] Two special cases are worth pointing out. As shown in some of the patent applications incorporated by reference, it is possible to make simplifying assumptions about the primaries and white point of a display— thus greatly simplify the design of the display system. When calculating the metamer slopes as above, there is one more variable that can be used to simplify designs of systems using metamers. The variable that can result in simplifications here is the relative luminosity of the primaries. In one embodiment, such as the RGBW subpixel layout of Figures 3,4, and 5A, the luminosity of the W subpixel 304 is approximately equal to the combined brightness of the other three primaries 306, 308, and 310, or accounts for approximately half of the total luminosity of the display. If the following assumptions are made, the metamer m slope values have particularly easy values to implement:<br>
	I	The RGB primaries substantially match the Rec. 709 primaries,<br><br>
2	The display produces a white point that substantially matches the 1)65 standard white point.<br><br>
3	The relative luminosity of the RGB primaries is substantially the same as in a 3 primary RGB system with the same Rec. 709 and 1)65 assumptions.<br><br>
4	The W sub-pixels account for one half of the total luminosity of each sub-pixel layout.<br><br><br>
[0062] The assumptions yield a particular M2X matrix (shown below). If this M2X matrix is used in the procedure above to calculate the metamer slope values when changing the W primary, this results in a particularly convenient set of values as shown below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	metamer slope values for changing W<br><br><br><br>
[0063) Thus, if W is changed by any amount, it may only suffice to change the other primaries by the opposite amount to generate a metamer for the starting color. From this set, it is easy to see that changing one of the ROB primaries requires changing the other color primaries by the same amount and the W primary by the opposite amount.<br><br>
(0064] In another embodiment, such as the case of the ROBW layout FIgure 6 (with repeating subpixel grouping 620 comprising red 606, green 608, blue 610 and white 604 subpixels), the white 604 subpixel has approximately one third of the total brightness of subpixel group 620. As a result, the white subpixel is equal to approximately one half of the remaining 2/3's of the luminosity. This relationship allows another convenient implementation in either hardware or software. For example, if one replaces assumption Number 4 above with:<br><br>
4	The W sub-pixel accounts for one third of the total luminosity of each sub-pixel layout.<br><br>
[0065] From this, one may calculate the M2X matrix and metamer slope values and the result is:<br>

(0066] Thus, if one changes W by any amount, one may change the other primaries by half that amount in the opposite direction to generate a metamer for the starting color. Conversely, if one changes one of the color primaries by any amount, then this requires<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
19<br><br><br>
changing the other color primaries by the same amount and the W primary by twice the amount in the opposite direction. It should be noted that calculating half or double any amount can easily be done in hardware with a minimum of gates and therefore a minimum of expense. There is, of course, some degree of freedom in implementing such change. For example, one could change the values of all of the subpixels within a repeating group to affect the desired result. Alternatively, only half of the red 606 and the green 608 subpixels may be adjusted within a given repeating group 620 to affect the desired change. One possible advantage for performing the change on one half of the available subpixels within a group might be for hardware optimization. For example, fewer gates or less memory may be needed if the changes could occur on a same line of output data — as opposed to multiple lines of output data.<br>
[0067] It should also be noted that, in an RGBW layout such as that shown in Figure 6, the blue 610 sub-pixel may contribute less to the luminosity than the Rec. 709 and 1)65 assumptions above would suggest. If this dimming of blue was taken into account then a different set of m slope values would result that may be more accurate but may not be as easy to implement in hardware.<br><br>
(0068] All the above metamer slope calculations assumed a display with only four (4) primaries. As mentioned above, similar procedures can be made to work with any number of primaries. However, once the number of primaries is five (5) or more, the step in Equation 105 may need to be changed because the remaining matrix is no longer square and may not be invertecL There are several procedures that still allow the generation of useful metamer slope numbers. A non-invertible matrix does not mean that there is no solution to the problem; it means that there are many solutions. Only one solution may be suitable to generate usable sets of metamers.<br>
[0069] In multi-primary systems larger than four, there will be an equation like Equation 101 that has more than four m slope values. One approach to solving these would be to set more than one of them slopes to arbitrary values. When only three m slope values remain, then the subsequent steps may contain a square matrix that may then be inverted. The choice of values to use need not be completely arbitrary. For example, in a five primary high brightness wide gamut RGBCW (red, green, blue, cyan, and white) system it might be reasonable to assume that red and cyan are complimentary colors and should change in<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
20<br><br><br>
opposite directions so one (1) for the mw slope value and negative one (-1) for the mc slope values may be a good place to start.<br><br>
(0070] In a six primary system like that of Figure 7 (with a subpixel repeating group 701 comprising red 706, green 708, blue 710, cyan 707, magenta 709, and yellow 711 subpixels), since blue and green can combine to make cyan, one could set the mg and mb slope values to negative one (-1) while setting the mc slope to I. Choosing different values besides negative one (-1) for the complimentary primaries may result in other solutions. It may be advantageous to change the arbitrary values until a "convenient" set of metamer slopes is found that is easier to implement in hardware.<br><br>
[0071] Another solution to solving form slope values in multi-primary systems greater than four would be to use a numerical solver. This is actually similar to the previous discussion but with a computer algorithm choosing arbitrary values until a set that works is found. Many numerical solver packages are available, one that has been shown to work is the solver built into the Mathcad program by Mathsoft Engineering &amp; Education, Inc. A numerical solver like this has a drawback that it may choose an undesirable solution. However, these packages allow one to set multiple constraint equations to avoid this. For example, constraining the solver from setting any of the slopes to zero, from choosing slopes greater than two (2), malting sure that complimentary colors have opposite sign slopes, etc.<br><br>
[0072] To simplify controller hardware designs, it may be desirable to adjust the size and/or brightness of the sub-pixels to produce convenient metamer slope values. The layouts of FIgures 3 and 6, for example, resulted in metamer slopes that were 1 or powers of two. In the layout of Figure 7, the size of the cyan 707 magenta 709 and yellow 711 sub-pixels may be resized in relation to red, green and blue (due to their larger wavelength bandpass) until the metamer slope solutions are convenient numbers, such as: one hall; one, two or other suitable numbers easy to implement in hardware.<br><br>
[0073] In an alternate embodiment, these sub-pixels could remain substantially the same size as the other sub-pixels — e.g. if the ratio of the brightness of the CYM primaries to the ROB primaries have a convenient value. The example of the layout of Figure 6 shows that a ratio of 2:1 can produce metamer slopes that are all 1 or Vz. Other ratios may produce other convenient metamer slope values.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
2!<br><br><br>
[0074] In other embodiments, adjusting the brightness of the different primaries may produce these simplifying results. One possible way of decreasing the brightness of a primary would be to increase the saturation. As the color of a primary becomes more pure — e.g. as the band pass filter becomes more narrow -- the luminosity of the primary becomes lower. This adjustment can be done in the design of a display to produce "convenient" metamer slopes while at the same time increasing the total gamut of the display.<br><br>
Metamer Filtering:<br><br>
[0075] On the RGBW system having the subpixel repeating grouping 320, as shown in FIgure 3, the layout could be seen as a checker board of white alternating with color (or more precisely, two checkerboards — one of blue and white subpixels and another of red and green subpixels). In subpixel rendering on this layout, one could perform a version of area resample subpixel rendering — such as 'One-Pixel-to-Two-Subpixel' mapping. In such a rendering, one input pixel may be mapped to a white 304 and blue 310 subpixel pair, such as pair 401 as shown in FIgure 4, and the surrounding alternating input pixels may be mapped to a green 308 and red 306 subpixel pair (e.g. 406).<br>
[00761 The freedom to select a color from among various metamers creates a new possibility to improve images. A display can be designed to select metamers in such a way that the W subpixcl values are increased when they lie on the bright side of a high-frequency edge or decreased when they lie on the dark side of high-frequency edges. When red 306 and green 308 subpixel pairs 406 fall on the bright side of a high-frequency edge, it maybe desirable to select a metamer such that the R and G subpixel values are increased. Conversely, when the subpixel pair 406 lies on the dark side of an edge the R and G subpixel values should be decreased. The B subpixel does not contribute significantly to brightness and does not need to be considered.<br><br>
[0077] The discussion above implies that different, perhaps opposite, filtering operations should be done on subpixel pairs 401 and subpixel pairs 406. The two filters below are one embodiment of these filters:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

[0078] The value of"x" may be adjusted as a scale factor of this operation. The value x = 0.5 is an example of a suitable value but other values may also be chosen. It should be noted that the sign of the filter is reversed for the RG color vs. white subpixel locations. This may lead to several hardware or software optiniizations. For example, using one filter but inverting the sign of the result on every other output subpixel pair. These filters resemble orthogonal sharpening filters from the art, however they are convolved with the L or luminance channel of the multi-primary data and not the color channels. The calculation of L is often done as a step in the GMA and it may be advantageous to save this value for later processing steps. This saved L value is shown between GMA module 102 and Line Buffers 104 in Figures IA and lB.<br><br>
[0079] In a prior art sharpening filters, the resulting 'a' value of the filter operation is eventually stored back in the pixel centered under the filter, However, in metamer ifitering the center 'a' value is used instead to modify the metamer of the center pixel with the following equations:<br><br><br>
W~W+a<br><br>
R=R~inr*a<br>
O=G-mga<br><br>
B = B - mb*a<br><br><br>
[0080] The mr, mg and mb constants are the metamer slope values. As described above with the layout of FIgure 3, these slope values may all have the value one (1) — malting the calculations easy to perform. It may be advantageous to set the default value of the metamer such that the W value equals the highest valued colored primary, or as close as<br><br><br><br><br><br>
23<br><br><br>
possible to it. This will allow for the greatest "head-room" for the metamer filtering operation. One possible method of performing this metamer adjustment is disclosed in copending patent application, entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMPLEMENTING IMPROVED GAMUT MAPPING ALGORITHMS (US Serial Number 11/278,675, US Published Patent Application Number 200X/XXXXXXX — herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) and is shown in Figure lB as metamer select module 101.<br>
[0081] Figure 11 is a high level diagram of one embodiment of metamer filtering. The system may operate on two sets of data, luminance data 1102 and image (or color) data 1104. These data sets may be coincident spatially — e.g. 1102 is the luminance data of image data 1104. Luminance channel 1102 is sampled for high frequencyinformation with a filter kernel 1110. This filter kernel is described above for use on the BW sub-pixel pairs of Figure 3. In Figure 11, the value of x may be chosen to be 0.5 and the resulting coefficients may be calculated as ~/z and minus 1/8. This filter maybe applied to a 3x3 area centered on a BW pixel 1106. The result is a sharpening value 'a' -- which is used to change the metamer of a color in step 1112. For each value 1106 in the luminance channel 1102, there is a corresponding R GB and W value 1108 shown diagrammatically in the color channels 1104. The RGBW values have their metamer changed in step 1112. The resulting metamer 1116 is stored in output buffer 1114 or passed on to the next step of processing.<br><br>
[00823 In Figure 12, the RG sub-pixel pairs are processed in a similar fashion but with the opposite filter kernel, as described above. Values centered on an RG sub pixel pair 1206 are sampled from the luminance channel 1202 and convolved with filter kernel 1210. The resulting sharpness value 'a' is used in step 1212 to calculate a new metamer for an RGBW value 1208 from the color channels 1204. The resulting new metanier 1216 is stored inoutputbuffer 1214 orpassed onto the next step of processing.<br><br>
[0083] It will be appreciated that FIgures 11 and 12 are offered for explanation purposes and that other embodiments are possible. As mentioned above, different high spatial frequency data may be obtained ~- other than luminance data (e.g. red and/or green color data or the like). Other filter masks could be employed to obtain different values that reflect other relationships between the metamers (e.g. non-linear relationship, or other dimensions e.g. 5x5, or the like). It will also be appreciated that techniques and methods disclosed herein are not limited to operating with metamers in an RGBW space as depicted in FIgures 11 and 12; but<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
24<br><br><br>
encompasses a multitude of mappings from one color space to another as discussed above. It would also be appreciated that for different subpixel layouts, there may be more than two subgroups of subpixels upon which different metamer filters would operate.<br>
[0084] Figures 14 and 15 are other embodiments of display systems that may incorporate the techniques shown in Figures 11 and 12. Figure 14 is a flowchart of the preconditioning metamer filtering. If not already available, luminance may be calculated in step 1404 from the input data values 1402. Both the input values and luminance values may be stored in line buffers 1406. Line buffers or some other storage device such as a frame buffer may be desirable because filtering operations may look at the surrounding values. In software implementations where memory is readily available, it may be possible to store entire images in frame buffers. In hardware implementations, it is possible to build line buffers that hold 2 or more lines of values that may suffice for the filter. Such a line buffer may use fewer gates and may thus be desirable for lowering the cost of manufacture. Line buffer 1406 supplies the surrounding luminance values to the metamer filters. As described above, one filter kernel may be used for source pixels that ~vill eventually be converted to BW sub-pixel pairs, as shown in #1 nletamer filter 1408. Also as described above, a different filter kernel, shown as #2 metamer filer 1410, may be used for input pixels that will eventually be converted to RG sub-pixel pairs. The sharpening values that result from the metamer filters is used in step 1412 to modit~' the metanier of input colors. Line buffer 1406 is constructed to present the RGBW value of the input data pixel that corresponds to the luminance value that is in the center of the metamer filters 1408 and 1410. Of course, BW and RG metamers for an RGBW space are all exemplary descriptions. Systems may employ different metamer filters sets -e.g. #1 Metamer Filter 1408 and #2 Metamer Filter 1410 and as many other filter sets as desired according to the input and output color spaces being mapped - as well as the topology of the target subpixel layout.<br><br>
(0085] In the case of pre-conditioning inetamer filtering, the adjusted pixel values maybe storedinasecond framebufferor2"~ set of line buffers 1414. This is anormalpartof sub-pixel rendering (SPR) which is also a filtering operation and may utilize a buffer to supply the surrounding values to a filter kernel. The output from line buffer 1414 is supplied to SPR filtering step 1416 which calculates values for output display 1418.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
25<br><br><br>
[0086] FIgure 15 is a flowchart of pre-conditioning metamer filtering when Difference of Gaussian (DOG) sharpening is also desirable. This flowchart is similar to FIgure 14 with the following differences. In Figure 15, the luminance values from line buffer 1506 may be also retained and stored in the second line buffer 1514. This second line buffer presents the luminance information to DOG filter 1518 at the same time that the adjusted input values are presented to SPR filter 1516. The results are summed at step 1520 before output to display at step 1522<br><br><br>
Metamer Filtering and Other Subplxel Rendering Techniques Combined:<br><br>
[00871 For another exposition and to better understand the value of this technique, but without limiting the scope of the attached claims, imagine that there are spatial frequency components of the luminance signal in the diagonal direction of an achromatic (i.e. black &amp; white) image. This signal would be attenuated by the area resample SPR if the same midpoint metainer selection occurred. But in this new case, with metazneric pre-filtering, the energy would be pre-sharpened and partially or completely cancel the filtering of the SPR, all without excessive chromatic error.<br><br>
[0088] To see this advantage, it is helpful to review the techniques of area resampling and conventional sharpening filters. Area resampling and conventional sharpening filters for this layout and others are previously disclosed in "IMPROVED SUBPIXEL RENDERING FILTERS FOR HIGH BRIGHTNESS SUBPDCEL LAYOUTS', (US Published Patent Application 2005/0225563 herein incorporated by reference) and also in CONVERSION OF A SUB-PIXEL FORMAT DATA TO ANOTHER SUB-PDCEL DATA FORMAT (US 2003/003.4992 herein incorporated by reference) and in FOUR COLOR ARRANGEMENT OF EMITI'ERS FOR SUBDIXEL RENDERING (US 2004/0051724<br><br>
herein incorporated by reference). Consider the arrangement of RG3W subpixels in Figure 3, the red 306, green 308, and blue 310 subpixels are grouped 506 together, as shown in Figure 54, in such a manner as to be considered a single reconstruction point 506B as shown in Figure SB. The white 304 subpixel is in another group, as its sole occupant per group. considered as another reconstruction point 501K Together, these two sets of reconstruction points 501A &amp; 506B form a checkerboard of white vs. color reconstruction points. These reconstruction points SOIA and 506B may be mapped to incoming pixels 509 with their<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
26<br><br><br>
associated implied sample areas 511 on a one-pixel-to-one-reconstruction-point basis as shown in Figure 5C. Isolating just the white reconstruction points 5011 in Figure 51), one can construct area resample areas 520 associated with each reconstruction point 5011. Such a resample area 520 may be defined, in one embodiment, by the area closest to its associated reconstruction point 5011, and where the boundaries may be defined by the set of lines equidistant from other neighboring reconstruction points. Thus, a given white reconstruction point 501 lA has an associated resample area 521. It also may have an associated polygonal (or other suitable shape) sharpening area 531, as defined by lines drawn between vertices at the nearest neighboring reconstruction points 501 lB of the same color.<br><br>
[0089] In Figure SE, the input pixels 509 may be mapped to the reconstruction points 5011 and resampled by the resample areas 520. A given resample area 521 associated ~vith a given reconstruction point $01 IA ovcrlaps five input pixels 509. As disclosed in the applications mentioned above, these areas give rise to fractions of the total area to generate the area resainple based filter kernel given below:<br>
	0	.125	 0<br>
	.125	.5	.125<br>
	0	.125	0<br><br>
[0090] Although it is possible to generate an approximate DOG sharpening filter by inspection on such a simple example here, it is instructive to proceed using the area resample filter construction method. A given sharpening area 531 overlaps nine incoming pixels, generating the sharpening area resample filter below<br>

[0091] To calculate an approximate Difference Of Osussians sharpening filter wavelet. the sharpening area filter kernel may be subtracted (e.g. by taking the difference) from the area resample filter kernel:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	Area	Resample		-	Sharpening		Area	=	DOG	Wavelet<br><br>
[0092] In one embodiment, the RGBW metamer filtering may tend to pre-sharpen, or peak, the high spatial frequency luminance signal, with respect to the subpixel layout upon which it is to be rendered, especially the diagonally oriented frequencies, before the area resample filter blurs the image as a consequence of filtering out chromatic image signal components which may alias with the color subpiicel pattern. The area resample filter tends to attenuate diagonals more than horizontal and vertical signals. The Difference of Gaussians (DOG) Wavelet — which may operate from the same color plane as the area resample, from another color plane, or from the luminance data plane --sharpens and maintains the horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies more than the diagonals. This exemplary DOG wavelet operation may be viewed as moving intensity values along same color subpixels in the diagonal directions while the inetamer filtering operation moves intensity values across different color subpixels.<br>
[0093] In comparison, the RGBW metamer filtering tends to sharpen the diagonals more than the horizontal and vertical signals, while area resainpling tends to attenuate diagonals more than the horizontal and vertical signals. In fact, they may be proportionally complementary to each other when the RGBW metarneric filter operator is set approximately to x 0,5. Thus~ in combination they serve to render the image with the full signal energy of the original image -- without the need for a DOG wavelet.<br>
[0094] However, it may be advw2tageous to use a DOG wavelet to further sharpen the image— e.g. as shown in Figures 15 and 17. One embodiment uses a DOG wavelet to increase the modulation transfer function of the less luminous primaries such that they better contribute, in proportion, to the rendering of the luminance signal. Restated with a variable in an exemplary DOG wavelet:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	DOG Wavelet	+	Area Resample<br><br><br>
[0095] The less luminous primaries may be sharpened with a higher amplitude DOG filter. That is to say, that the z value is higher for darker primaries. For example, the white subpixel is the brightest and thus could be used as the normalizing brightness. Thus the z values might be determined b)~<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

where Y~, Y,, Y, and Yb are the luminance values (either approximated, modeled, measured or the like) of each fully "on" white, green, red, and blue primazy respectively, z~ z~, z~, z~ are the "z" values for sharpening the white, green, red, and blue subpixels respectively, in descending order of brightness for convenience and "s" is a scaling factor for the level of sharpening desiret<br><br>
[0096] The white color plane could be sharpened along with the dimmer primaries using the DOG wavelet by replacing the constant with a number less than one.<br><br>
[0097] In rendering band-limited images, it may be advantageous to interpolate values for half of the subpixels, taking advantage of the "extra" subpixel per pixel in the horizontal (higher subpixel density) direction using a suitable interpolation filter such as a sinc, windowed sinc, or Catmul-Rom cubic filter or other filter known now or to be later developed in the art For example, the luminance, red, and the blue color planes may be interpolated between the original samples before being used by the above DOG wavelet and area resampling filters. The white and the green color planes would remain as before. Such filtering operations have been previously described in "IMPROVED SUBPDCEL RENDERiNG FILTERS FOR HIGH BRIGHTNESS SUBPIXEL LAYOUTS,' (US Patent<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
29<br><br><br>
Application Publication 2005/0276502) and incorporated herein by reference. An example of a useful interpolation filter is the Catmul-Rom cubic filter:<br>
	/	/16	'16	/16<br><br><br><br><br>
[0098] Rather than performing the metameric filtering as a preconditioning step, it is possible to construct SPR so that it directly performs the metameric filtering in a single pass. For example, if one incoming pixel were mapped to a single white subpixel 304 as shown in Figure 5A, and the surrounding input pixels were mapped to the red, green, and blue subpixels as a group (e.g. group 506), centered on the green subpixels, than a single filter set may be used for all four color planes. As merely for example, shown below is a set of such direct filters where the metameric filter coefficient x = 0,5:<br><br><br>

	0	.125	 0		 0	-.125	 0<br><br><br>
[0099] Although it is possible to generate an approximate metameric sharpening filter by inspection on such a simple example here, it is instructive to proceed using the area resample filter construction method. In Figure SF, the white 5011 and color 5066 luminance reconstruction points are shown overlain on the incoming pixels 509 and their associated implied sample areas 511. The luminance resaniple areas 525 substantially coincide with the implied sample areas 511 of the incoming pixels 509. A given reconstruction point, in this example, a white reconstruction point 501 lA, has an associated luminance sample area 526, substantially coincident with an implied sample area 511 of an incoming pixel 509. Thus, the luminance sample area overlaps substantially one implied sample area and results in an approximate unity filter with a value of one (1). As shown, luminance reconstruction point 501 IA may also have an associated polygonal metameric sharpening sample area 536 defined by lines with vertices at the nearest neighbors of the opposite metamer exchange reconstruction points 5066A. This metameric sharpening sample area overlaps five implied<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

pixel sample areas 511, generating the filter kernel below. To calculate the direct metameric filter kernel, the metameric sharpening area filter kernel may be subtracted from the luminance sample area filter kernel:<br>
	0	0	0		0	.125	 0		0 -.125	 0<br>
	0	1	0	-	.125	.5	.125	=	-.125 .5	-.125<br>
	0	0	0		0	.125	 0		0 -.125	 0<br>
	Area Resample	-	Sharpening Area	= Metamer Sharpening Wavelet<br><br><br>
[00100] It should be noted that a similar behavior occurs in the direct method and the metameric filter preconditioning, when an incoming pixel value (as 501) is mapped to white subpixel 304 and the incoming pixel value has more brightness than its surrounding pixels 506, the white subpixel 304 gets brighter, etc. The two methods may not produce identical results however. The result of the preconditioning operation followed by subpixel rendering is a convolution of the two operations. The output intensity value of a given subpixel is affected by the input luminance value of pixels that surround the four nearest neighbors, while the direct metameric filtering operation does not exhibit this behavior. This suggests that the metameric preconditioning filter method may be suited to band-limited images while the direct method is\suitable for both band-limited and non-band-limited images, performing particularly well on black on white text when the metameric filter operator is set approximately to x = 0.5 as shown above. As before, other values for the operator are possible.<br><br>
[00101] It is also possible to construct a direct metameric filter that maps the white and blue subpixel to the same incoming pixel as a group. However, when this is done, the metameric filter may have the reverse sign as shown below. This may have the effect of blurring the blue image component. This may be reversed with a high amplitude sharpening DOG wavelet added to the self-color area resampling filter also shown below. The red, green, and white color planes continue to be filtered as above,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

[00102] Figures 16 and 17 are two embodiments of systems that combine the features of nietamer filtering with subpixel rendering — called direct metamer filtering for the purposes of this application. In Figures 14 and 15, it can be seen that two frame buffers or line buffers are described. Both of these line buffers are intended for holding and organizing information to supply the values needed for a filtering operation. However, in direct metamer filtering, the two filtering operations are combined together and only one line buffer or frame buffer may suffice. This results iii a significant savings of memory requirements in software implementations or a significant savings of gates in hardware implementations. In addition, only one metazner filter kernel is necessary instead of a separate one for BW vs. RW pairs of output sub-pixels. Figure 16 shows this embodiment. If they are not already available from previous steps, luminance values are calculated in step 1604 from input pixel values 1602. The input values and luminance values are stored in line buffers 1606. Line buffers 1606 present the color input values to the SPR filter 1608 and the luminance information to metamer filter 1610. The results from the two filters is summed at step 1612 and sent to the output display 1614 or sent to the next step in processing.<br><br>
[00103] Figure 17 shows the direct metamer filtering algorithm of FIgure 16 with the addition of DOG filtering when additional sharpening of the image is desirable. The luminance values from line buffer 1706 are used in an additional DOG filter step 1712. The output from this DOG filter 1712 is summed with the output from SPR filter 1708 and metamer filter 1710 in the summing step 1714. The result of summer 1714 is sent to output display 1716 or to the next processing step. In another embodiment, it may be possible to combine metamer filter 1710 and DOG filter 1712 into one pre-caleulated filter kerneL<br><br>
[00104] For another embodiment, the layout in Figure 6 has one white 604 subpixel per repeat cell 620 of six subpixels (i.e, comprising red 606, green 608, blue 610 and white 604 subpixels as shown). The white 604 subpixel is in half of the rows, the RWG rows 625,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
32<br><br><br>
while a single blue subpixel is found on the other rows, the GBR rows 635. To offset or reverse the blurring effect of the area resample filter on the white 604 subpixel, a direct metameric filter may be constructed:<br>
	Sampling	the White	Color Plane:			Sampling the Luminance Plane<br>
	-.015625	.140625	.140625	-.015625		-.125	-.125<br>

	-.015625 .140625	.140625 -.015625	-.125 -.125<br><br><br>
[00105] The white plane may be sampled with an area resample filter that has been modified to have Catniul-Rorn cubic type interpolation in the horizontal axis. For band-limited images, this interpolation may increase the image quality, taking advantage of the white 604 subpixel's interstitial position between the red/green columns on either side. The luminance plane may be sampled with a direct nietameric filter, concentrating intensity in the white subpixel when the pixels mapped to the RWG row 625 have more luminance than the two GBR rows 635 above and below said RWG row 625, etc. The red 606 and green 608 subpixels in the RWG row 625 do not use a metametic filter:<br><br><br>

	0	.125	 0		-.0625	0	-.0625<br><br><br>
[001061 The above filter is an area resample filter with a DOG shaipening filter. XThile the red 606 and green 608 subpixels in the RWG rows 625 do not have metameric filters, the red 606 and green 608 in the GBR rows 635 do. The red 606 subpixel filter may be as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br>

[00107] The green 608 subpixcl filter may be as follows:<br><br><br>

	o	.125	0	-.0625 -.0625 -.125<br><br><br>
[001081 Examination and comparison of the two filters sampling the luminance plane will reveal that the second filter is a DOG sharpening filter with a metameric filter added. This metameric filter is the counter part to the white subpixel metamexic filter.<br><br>
[00109] The blue 610 subpixel presents two choices. In one embodiment, it may have the counterpart filter to the white 604 subpixel, using substantially the same metameric filter. For band-limited images, this may be an advantageous choice to ensure color accuracy. However, for non-band-limited images, especially black text on white, the blue 610 subpixel may represent the blue component of the rows 625 above and below as well as in line 635. In one embodiment, it need not use the metameric filter, leaving the blue image "fuzzy", which would tend to match the lower resolution of the human vision system, and that for non-band-limited images, the image has less color error without the metameric filter.<br><br>
[00110] With metameric filtering on this layout in Figure 6, horizontally oriented lines and spaces may appear sharper, but vertically aligned lines and spaces may still appear to be "fuzzy" and "dotty". A simple technique, while not being a metameric operation, may improve the appearance of vertically orientated lines and spaces. Just as metanieric filters are directed by the local entropy and sign of the luminance signal at a point in the image to select a better metarner at that point, the following contrast improvement procedure given below measures the entropy, regardless of the sign, to push down the intensity of the white subpixel.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
34<br><br><br>
This may have the tendency to increase the contrast of black on white text and of natural images, in a manner similar to that explained in detail in the application entitled "METHODS<br><br>
AND SYSTEMS FOR SUB-PIXEL RENDERING WITH GAMMA ADJuSTMENT", The<br><br>
equation is:<br><br><br><br><br>
where Lr and Lg arc the luminance values of the pixel mapped to the red 606 subpixel and the green 608 subpixel on either side of the white 604 subpixel respectively.<br><br>
[00111] In the RGBW system, one possible metameric degree of freedom is W vs. ROB. In other four color systems such as RGBC, where the primaries are red, green, blue, and cyan respectively there is also one possible degree of metameric freedom that is roughly RC vs. GB. Another four color system may be RGCM, where the primaries are red, green, cyan, and magenta respectively; there is one possible degree of freedom that is RC vs. GM. Another four color system would be RGBY, where the primaries are red, green, blue and yellow respectively, where one possible degree of metarneric freedom is roughly RG vs. Y. Other metameric pairs and degrees of freedom are also possible as well.<br><br>
[001121 In all of the figures presented herein, such additional subpixel layouts may be obtained by replacing all or some of the white subpixels with either cyan, yellow, grey or other colors, as the case may be. In particular, the techniques discussed herein may be employed with the layout of Figures 2,3,4,5,6, 9A and 10 with all or some of the white subpixels with either cyan, yellow, grey or other colors. In addition, the techniques discussed herein encompass the scope of all manners of display technologies, including transmissive and uon-transmissive display panels, such as Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD), reflective Liquid Crystal Displays, emissive ElectroLuminecent Displays (EL), Plasma Display Panels (PDP), Field Emitter Displays (FED), Eleetrophoretic displays, Iridescent Displays (10), Incandescent Display, solid state Light Emitting Diode (LED) display, and Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays.<br><br>
[00113] A five color system such as ROBOW, where the primaries are red, green, blue, cyan, and white respectively, there are two possible degrees of metameric freedom that is roughly RC vs. GB and W vs. RGBC. A six color system such as RGBCYM, where the primaries are red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, and magenta have even more degrees of freedom<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
35<br><br><br>
such as RC vs. YB vs. GM and ROB vs. CYM. One can imagine any arbitrarily high number N of primaries in a display which may give N-3 degrees of freedom to select a rnetamer. Each degree of freedom in a multiprirnary system is an opportunity for a metameric filter, either for metameric preconditioning or direct metarneric filtering to be constructed and used to improve the subpixel rendering system.<br><br>
[00114] In Figure 8, a square group of four subpixels 802 is shown, comprised of four primaries. In this arrangement, each primary is on. a hexagonal grid with the same relationship of neighboring primaries. If the primaries are chosen such that each column has a pair of primaries that are exactly ox roughly metameric pairs with the alternating cohunna, then the construction of a metameric filter, either sequential metameric filter preconditioning or direct metamerie filtering type, may proceed as follows.<br>
[001151 First, determine the Area Resample and DOG filters for the layout, using the methods that have been disclosed in the above listed prior applications to create an approximate filter set. For one cmbodinient, it may be;<br><br><br>
Area Resampling the Self Color Plane:	Difference of Gaussians:<br>
	0	0	~Z4	0	0<br>
	.0625	.125	.0625	~'6 0	0	ci -4<br>
	~l25	.25	.125	+	0	0 a	0	0<br>
	.0625 .125 .0625	Z/ ~	Q	0	/6<br><br>
0	0 -/6 0 0<br><br><br>
[00116] The DOG filter above may be generated from simple examination. As before~ the DOG filter may sample either the self color plane, another color plane, or the luminance plane, as the DOG filter transfers signal intensities between same color subpxxels. The value of"z" may be adjusted per color as explained earlier, with the brightest primary serving as a reference.<br><br>
(001 17J Examining the layout 800 in Figure 8 for a metamer jilter, it should be noted that the colors in each column 825 and 835 may move together as the metamers are adjusted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
36<br><br><br>
Thus, moving energy along a column 825 and 835 does not provide as much value as moving energies from the neighboring columns. Thus, the metamer filter may be as shown here:<br>
	-'6	0<br>
	-/3	X<br>
		0	-<br><br>
[00118] The result of this filter may be used to adjust the values directly as a metameric filter, perhaps combined with the DOG filter above, if the metamers have the same coefficients such as for RGCM primaries, or used to push the metaroer values in a metameric filter preconditioning operation before subpixel rendering by the Area Resample + DOG filter above if the metanier coefficients are not the same, such as for RGBC primaries, Of course the indirect, preconditioning method would change the signs for the filters for each alternating column 825 and 835.<br>
[00119] Examining Figure 2 (with repeating group 202 comprising white 204, red 206, green 208, blue 210 and fifth color 212) and Figure 10 (with repeating group 1002 comprising white 1004, red 1006, green 1008, blue 1010 and fifth color 1012) we note that there are five primaries, with four of them at a lower resolution on the same hexagonal grid as the four primaries in Figure 8. Figure 9A (with repeating group 902 comprising white 904, red 906, green 908, blue 910 and fifth color 912) has an arrangement similar to Figure 2 save that the four lower resolution primaries are arranged in rows instead of columns. Each of these layouts in Figures 2, 9A, and 10, may use similar subpixel rendering and metamerie filters for the lower resolution primaries as just described for the layout shown in Figure 8, with allowance made for rotation of the filters for Figure 9A. However, in these layouts, an additional, higher resolution primary is present (e.g. 204, 904,1004). This additional primary may be a bright color primaiy such as yellow, white, or grey.<br>
(00120] Although it is possible to generate an approximate DOG sharpening filter for a hex arrangement of saturated color subpixels by inspection or examination as was done above, it is instructive to proceed using the strict area resaniple filter construction method. Examining Figure 9B, which shows the one of the satuarated color primary reconstruction points 9122 overlain and mapped on an array of pixels 909 and their implied sample areas<br>
925.	A given saturated primary reconstruction point 9122A has associated resample area 926 and sharpening area 936, generating the following filter kernels:<br><br><br><br><br>
37<br><br><br>
	00000	071170	0-7-11-70<br>
	01240120	12021201	-1-819-8-1<br>
	03264320-	82122218=-8l1421l-8<br>
	01240120	12021201	-1-819-8-1<br>
	00000	071170	0-7-11-70<br>
	Area kesainpie	-	Sharpening Area	=	DOG Wavelet<br><br>
Note that the coefficients are divided by 256.<br><br>
[00121] As noted earlier, a five primary display may have additional degrees of freedom in which to select a metamer to best render a given image at the subpixel level. Assuming that these layouts are RGBCW systems, there are at least two degrees of freedom available, W vs. RGBC and RC vs. GB. Both degrees of freedoms maybe used in the same image to improve rendering accuracy. For merely one example, assume that a vertically oriented line of a pastel color, that is to say, not white but still substantially de-saturated is to be rendered onto a dark grey background onto the display of either Figure 2 or Figure 10. In that case, the desired metamer may maximize the intensity of the white plane on the line and reduce it on either side, in response to a W vs. RGBC metameric filter. Further, the desired metamer may maximize the intensity of the metanieric pair in a column, either RC or GB, upon which the bright vertical line is to be drawn and reduce the intensity of the columns on either side, in response to an RC vs. GB metameric filter.<br><br>
[00122] A W vs. RGBC metameric filter preconditioning operation may proceed similarly to that described earlier for the W vs. RGB system:<br><br>
Samples the Luminance Plane:<br>
	.x/8	~xIs		~x/s<br>
	~x/8	 x<br>
	~xI8	~xI8		~xls<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
38<br><br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCW valucs of each pixel:<br>
W W + a;<br><br>
R - R - a;<br><br>
G=G~a;<br><br>
B = B - a;<br><br>
C=C-a<br><br>
And samples the luminance plane for the RC vs. GB metaniers:<br>
	Rand C mapped pixels	G and B mapped pixels<br>
		o	- X/	x16	~<br>
		x	x/	X/	-x<br>
	~x/6	0	/6	X,	o	X1<br><br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCW values of each pixel:<br>
W =<br>
R R + a*mr;<br>
G=G~a*mg;<br><br>
BB~a*mb;<br><br>
C = C + a*mc<br>
where mr, mg, mb, and mc are metameric m' slope coefficients that scale the effect of the value of"a~ for each color, red, green, blue, and cyan respectively to maintain the desired color through the metameric adjustment.<br><br>
[00123] It should be noted that in one set of formula above where the Wprimary is changed, there may be no metamer slope terms. When modifying the W vs the color primaries, this may be treated as another special ease where the metamer slope terms all simplify topl~ or minus one if the correct assumptions can be made, as described in the section above about calculating metamers.<br><br>
[00124] These operations may be substantially commutative, meaning they might be done in either order. After the metamer precondition, the data may be subpixel rendered. The white subpixel planes may be sampled to the fully one-pixel-to-one-white-subpixel mapped layout using a unity filter, a 1 X I array with the single filter coefficient value of one (I). The lower resolution colored primaries on a hexagonal grid may be area resampled and sharpened<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
39<br><br><br>
with a DOG using the ~fllters disclosed earlier. Further, since the colored subpixels are displaced at interstitial points, it may be advantageous for rendering band-limited images using a suitable interpolating reconstruction filter, such as those discussed above. The layouts of FIgure 2 and 9 may use a single horizontally oriented Catmul-Rom cubic filter, while the layout in Figure 10 may use a Catmul-Rom bicubic filter, either as an axis separable operation or as a convolved operation, as is understood in the art, on the color data planes to shift the phase of the reconstructed image before the subpixel rendering.<br><br>
(00125J Examining FIgure 7, the layout 700 shown is comprised of a six subpixel repeat cell 701 of six primaries, RGBCMY; substantially red 706, green 708, blue 710, cyan 707, magenta 709, and yellow 711 respectively. This collection of primaries exhibits a number of degrees of freedom as discussed above; RC vs. GM vs. BY and RGB vs. CMY. In this example, the three sets of pairings of two colors that form diebromatic metamers for white are arranged in columns; red 706 and cyan 707 are in a first column 726, green 708 and magenta 709 are in a second column 728, and blue 710 and yellow 711 is in a third column 730. The two sets of trichromatic metamers for white are arranged in columns; red 706, green<br><br>
708, and blue 710 are in a first row 725, and cyan 707, magenta 709, and yellow 711 are in a second row 735. These columns and rows are repeated across a display as many times as are desired to complete a given desired resolution panel, as known in the art. An additional feature is that the sizes of the subpixels may be adjusted such that the two trichromatic pairs for white are substantially the same luminance. In this example, the red 706, green 708, and blue 710 are twice as tall as the cyan 707, magenta 709, and yellow 711 as these colors generally are half the luminance when constructed as filters over a broad spectrum emitter or reflector as is found in backlit Liquid Czystal Displays, reflective Liquid Crystal Displays, and filtered white emitting Organic Light Emitting Diode displays (OLED). Other display technologies may exhibit other ratios and may be adjusted accordingly as desired. This feature allows each row 725 and 735 to render a white horizontal line with equal luminance. It should also be noted that the dichromatic metameric pair in the columns 726, 728, and 730 may also exhibit equal luminance, allowing each said column to render a vertical line with equal luminance.<br><br>
[00126] One-Pixel-to-One-Subpixel rendering filters for the layout 700 may be constructed as:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
40<br><br><br>
Area Resampling the Self Color Plane:<br>
	I	/12	1<br>
	'6	/6	1/<br>
	/12	/12	/12<br><br>
[00127] The RGB vs. CMY metameric preconditioning filters, sampling the luminance (L) plane may be constructed:<br>
	RGB Rows 725	CMY Rows 735<br>
	-'6	'/6	-/6	/6	1,	/6<br>
	/	/	/	1/	-/3	/3	= a<br>
	'/6	-/6	-/6	/6	16	/6<br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCMY values of each pixel:<br><br>
R=R+a<br><br>
G=G+a<br><br>
B=B+a<br><br>
C=C—a<br><br>
M=M—a<br><br>
Y=Y-a<br><br>
[00128] The RC vs. GM vs. BY metameric preconditioning filters, sampling the luminance (L) plane may be constructed:<br>
	0	1/	-/4	~x,4	x,4	0<br>
	0	x/	I,	= d	42	1/	0	= e<br>
	1/	/	/	~/4	0<br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCMY values of each pixel mapped to the RC columns 726:<br>
R'=R+d+e<br><br>
G=G-d<br><br>
B=B-e<br><br>
CC+d+e<br><br>
M=M-d<br><br>
YY-e<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCMY values of each pixel mapped to the GM columns 728:<br><br>
RR-e<br><br>
GG+d+e<br><br><br>
CC-e<br><br>
MM+d+e<br>
Y=Y-d<br><br>
Then modifies the RGBCMY values of each pixel mapped to the BY columns 728:<br><br>
R=R-d<br><br>
G=G-e<br><br>
BB+d+e<br><br>
C=C—d<br><br>
MM--e<br><br>
Y=Y+d+e<br><br>
[00129] As before, the values of 'x' may be adjusted as desired. It should be noted that there may be no need of slope value in order to create metamers, This is the result of the additional feature that the sizes of the subpixels 707,709 and 711 were adjusted such that the two trichromatic pairs for white are substantially the same luminance. Of course, if the subpixels were of equal size and/or dimension, appropriate slope values could be created in accordance with the principles and techniques described herein.<br><br>
[00 130] In some applications where the illustrated display systems and techniques may find use, the Gamut Mapping function may have already been performed by an another component or system; or the multiprimary image may have been captured directly from a multispectral camera, that is, one that captures images in four or more spectral bands that lie in or even outside the normal human vision system range of spectral wavelengths. For example, an RGBC multiprimary display may reconstruct images captured on an RGBC camera. In such cases, it may advantageous to calculate the luminance "L" value for use by the subpixel rendering and metameric filters, as this value may not be supplied directly by the input image. In the case of a display, the fonnula for calculating the luminosity can be derived from the specifications of the display, from measurements, or from the M2X matrix for that display. In the case of a multi-spectral camera, the formula could be derived from the<br><br><br>
specification or from measurements front pictures taken of test patterns of known spectral ramps. If the camera has substantially the same multiple primaries as a multi-primary display in the same system, then it would be advantageous to make the simplifying assumption that the primaries and relative luminosities of the display and camera are identical. This will simplify the rnat1~, the resulting software or hardware designs and thus decrease the total complexity and cost of the total system.<br>
