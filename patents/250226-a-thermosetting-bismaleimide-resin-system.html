				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 . The present invention relates to bismaleimide (BMI) resins<br>
for use in complex and diverse high performance composite applications. In<br>
preferred embodiments, this invention relates to a composition of BMI with<br>
improved tack and thermal durability through the incorporation of a curing agent<br>
for bismaleimides that unexpectedly is non-crystallizing. The present invention<br>
further relates to BMI resin formulations suitable to make prepregs with reduced<br>
viscosity for improved prepreg manufacturing, handling properties and handling<br>
stability.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
 Fiber reinforced, polymer matrix laminated composite<br>
structures (PMCs) are widely used in a number of applications and increasing<br>
amounts of composite structures are being used in high performance aerospace<br>
applications.<br>
 Most composite parts in the aerospace industry use epoxy<br>
resins because of epoxy's good combination of mechanical properties, wide<br>
service temperature range, and ease of part manufacture. However, some<br>
composite applications require higher thermal durability of the finished composite<br>
than traditional epoxies can provide.<br>
 Epoxy PMCs cannot be used in 'extreme environments such<br>
as high temperature applications, above about 180°C, because they lack<br>
adequate thermal durability.<br>
 A widely used high service temperature PMC resin currently<br>
used is PMR-15, a version of which is sold as CYCOM® 2237 by Cytec<br>
Engineered Materials Inc. CYCOM® 2237 has a service temperature of about<br>
288 °C for exposure of less than 100 hours to about 232X for exposure of more<br>
than 2000 hours. However, since the development of PMR-15 there has been<br>
extensive work to find a PMR-15 replacement to overcome its severe limitations<br>
restricting its use. The limitations of PMR-15 are micro-cracks and processing<br>
difficulty. An additional limitation with PMR-15 is that it contains 4,4'-<br>
methylenedianiline, MDA, a health hazard requiring extensive environmental<br>
controls.<br>
 Where aerospace applications require service temperature<br>
beyond the capability of epoxy resins, bismaleimides resins are gaining<br>
acceptance because of their epoxy-like processing properties and higher service<br>
temperature. Current BMI based resin composite systems offer service<br>
temperatures in the range of 149°C to 232°C providing excellent mechanical<br>
properties such as no micro-cracking and no environmental hazards. For<br>
example, Cycom® 5250-4 resin prepreg is offered by Cytec Engineered Materials<br>
Inc., as a high temperature primary construction material with a service<br>
temperature of about 232°C for exposure of less than about 100 hours to about<br>
190°C for exposure of more than 2000 hours.<br>
 BMI resins have been modified to improve toughness and<br>
manufacturing handling characteristics such as tack through the co-reaction of 2,<br>
2'-diaIlylbisphenol A (DABA) with substantially aromatic bismaleimides, most<br>
specifically bismaleimide incorporating 4,4'-methylenedianaline (MDA-BMI).<br>
This process is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,140. However, this<br>
system has inadequate thermal durability for 232°C use as identified by<br>
unacceptable weight loss and micro-cracking. Thermal aging at 232°C<br>
demonstrates unacceptable thermal durability for the desired exposure of 2000<br>
hours for many applications.<br>
 Additional BMI resin compounds are more fully described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,018 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,615, which technologies<br>
incorporate additional solid, undissolved, BMI to improve tack and drape. These<br>
BMI resins give superior mechanical properties, including high service<br>
temperature performance, and ease of processing into complex composite parts,<br>
but remain inadequate for 232°C use in excess of 2000 hours as identified by<br>
unacceptable weight loss and micro-cracking. In addition, while this art generally<br>
discloses that 1,6-hexamethylenediamine bismaleimide (HMDA-BMI) can be<br>
incorporated into a BMI resin system, the art does not teach that such an addition<br>
can be modified to enhance thermal durability or reduce viscosity to improve tack.<br>
Indeed, the art suggests that incorporation of an aliphatic BMI such as HMDA-<br>
BMI reduces the Tg and would thus, not be appropriate.<br>
 Other improvements in BMI technology were advanced to<br>
improve tack, but these advances did not sufficiently reduce the viscosity for<br>
processing and the tack remained unacceptable for high temperature<br>
applications. The improvement is disclosed as a eutectic blend of the<br>
substantially aromatic bismaleimides from MDA-BMI and toluene diamine (TDA-<br>
BMI) with an aliphatic bismaleimide derived form 2,2,4-trimethlyhexamethylene<br>
diamine (TMH-BMI) in a ratio of about 50/25/15 for MDA-BMI/TDA-BMI/TMH-BMI.<br>
These formulations are described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 4,211,861 and U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,211,860.<br>
 Another limitation of current BMI resin formulations is that<br>
additional toughening agents such as thermoplastics are not able to be added to<br>
current BMI resin systems because of the inherent high viscosity of current BMI<br>
resins systems not allowing the addition of further materials that will further<br>
increase the viscosity. The addition of thermoplastics to current BMI resin<br>
systems increases the resin viscosity to such a level that the resulting resin<br>
viscosity is out of range of practical application.<br>
. Current BMI resin systems also have the additional limitation<br>
of being unable to fully impregnate carbon fiber prepregs because they contain a<br>
high solid BMI content. Current BMI based resin systems contain 35 wt% to 46<br>
wt% undissolved solid BMI, as a slurry in the resin making them notoriously<br>
difficult to fully impregnate. As such, to fully impregnate a prepreg incorporating<br>
a BMI resin, high processing temperatures are required to reduce the viscosity of<br>
the liquid phase component of the resin system and dissolve more solids.<br>
Nonetheless, the high solid content of the resin makes manufacturing<br>
applications difficult and requires use of low speeds on automatic tape lay-up during<br>
part manufacturing. The solid BMI particles in the resin are taught to be necessary to<br>
ensure sufficient tack for lay-up, but with more solid particles, the out time is reduced to<br>
often less than two days before the tack is reduced to unusable levels.<br>
The present invention solves many of these issues by providing a high temperature<br>
composite with increased tack and reduced viscosity to allow for a useable BMI resin<br>
based prepreg. This system enhances the mechanical and thermal performance<br>
characteristics of the BMI resin in the final composite. Additionally, by reducing the<br>
overall viscosity, the present invention allows the incorporation of more total BMI in the<br>
resin system to improve mechanical properties as well as the possible incorporation of a<br>
thermoplastic.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for a combination of curing agents for BMI monomers<br>
that unexpectedly provide a resin composition where the liquid phase component is<br>
stable to crystallization and improves tack and thermal durability. The curing agent<br>
diallyl ether of bisphenol A (marketed as Matrimid 2292 by Huntsman) unexpectedly<br>
inhibits the crystallization of bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of an aromatic radical, in<br>
particular, 4,4'- (2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (marketed as TM123 by<br>
Technochemie). <br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a thermosetting bismaleimide resin<br>
system comprising a liquid phase and a solid phase where the non-crystallizing liquid<br>
phase contains the curing agents diallyl ether of an aromatic radical and a<br>
bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of an aromatic radical along with an aromatic BMI as a<br>
particle slurry and optionally a free radical inhibitor.<br>
The incorporation of diallyl ether of an aromatic radical to overcome limitations of<br>
current BMI systems is unexpected because combinations of bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether<br>
of an aromatic radical with increased amounts of 2,2'-diallyl..........................................<br>
bisphenol A increases crystal formation rather than decreasing crystallization. As such, it<br>
would be expected that its precursor, diallyl ether of an aromatic radical, would also<br>
increase crystallization.<br>
The present invention provides a higher service temperature with increased thermal<br>
durability than the prior art. The invention also provides the advantage of curing without<br>
volatiles, contains no toxic components, and has the ability to be used in resin infusion<br>
applications; a significant advantage over PMR-15 and prior BMI resin systems.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is for prepregs using the resin of the<br>
present invention to provide stable tack, characterized by nominal to no crystallization of<br>
the uncured liquid resin, and excellent thermal durability of the cured resin composite<br>
system.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention provides for a bismaleimide resin<br>
composition comprising 20% to 80% by weight of particulate aromatic BMI monomers<br>
slurry mixed with a liquid monomer phase component of the resin composition. The<br>
solid phase is primarily micronized particulate BMI. The non-crystallizing liquid phase is<br>
preferably a combination of diallyl ether of an aromatic radical and bis(alkenylphenoxy)<br>
ether of an aromatic radical with BMI resins in solution.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention provides for a BMI resin composition<br>
comprising about 2 wt% to 30 wt% diallyl ether of an aromatic radical; 15 wt% to 60<br>
wt% bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of an aromatic radical; 20 wt% to 80 wt% particulate<br>
aromatic BMI; and wherein the resin displays improved thermal durability.<br>
The present invention provides for a BMI resin composition having a lower viscosity.<br>
Lower resin viscosity improves certain uncured characteristics such as improved<br>
processing in resin infusion processes. It also improves BMI prepreg and adhesive<br>
handling characteristics such as tack and drape. The lower resin viscosity has further<br>
advantages of allowing modification....................................................................................<br>
of the resin by dissolving thermoplastics to improve the uncured and cured resin<br>
characteristics while maintaining the resin viscosity at usable levels.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 The present invention involves BMI resin formulations that<br>
incorporate substantially aromatic BMI monomer curing agents with substantially<br>
aromatic BMI resins to reduce the viscosity and crystallization of the uncured<br>
resin, and micro-cracking of the cured composite as measured by reduced<br>
weight loss after thermal aging, while maintaining high Tg. The reduced viscosity<br>
of the uncured resin aids in the processing of the prepreg into complex shapes<br>
by hand or automated processing methods.<br>
 The present invention combines a diallyl ether of a<br>
substantially aromatic radical with a bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical, a solid BMI resin and optionally a free radical inhibitor to create<br>
a BMI resin with uncured low viscosity and resistance to crystallization and cured<br>
high Tg.<br>
 The diallyl ether of a substantially aromatic radical is<br>
preferably the diallyl ether of bisphenol A and is more preferably a monomer.<br>
Formula 1 is a schematic representation of diallyl ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical acceptable for the present invention.<br><br>
Formula 1 - diallyl ether of a substantially aromatic radical<br>
 Wherein R1, R1' = hydrogen, alkyl, or aromatic; R2, R2' =<br>
hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, phenoxy, or alkyloxy; and where X would be a direct<br>
bond or one of the following functional groups:<br><br>
 The diallyl ether of a substantially aromatic radical can be in<br>
an amount from 5% to about 90% by weight and more preferably about 10% to<br>
about 30% by weight and most preferably 15% to about 25% by weight of the<br>
liquid monomer component of the resin system.<br>
 The benefit of the present invention is that the diallyl ether of<br>
a substantially aromatic radical combined with bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a<br>
substantially aromatic radical is more resistant to crystallization than the<br>
combination of the traditional 2,2'-dially! bisphenol A with bis(alkenylphenoxy)<br>
ether of a substantially aromatic radical. The preferred diallyl ether of a<br>
substantially aromatic radical is diallyl bisphenol A. This resistance to<br>
crystallization is possibly due to the monomers' similarities in that they are both<br>
non-polar and therefore, improve tack, which is diminished or eliminated when<br>
the resin system crystallizes.<br>
 The traditional co-reactant 2, 2'- diallylbisphenol A (marketed<br>
by Huntsman as Matrimid 5292B) and others are described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,100,140 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,018 and schematically represented below in<br>
Formula 2.<br><br>
Formula 2 -2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A<br>
 The bis(alkenyiphenoxy) ether of a substantially aromatic<br>
radical is preferably 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123), and<br>
more preferably is a monomer. These comonomers react with a BMI to form a<br>
cured network with high Tg and excellent oxidative stability,<br>
 There are two main challenges with the use of<br>
bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially aromatic radical. First, the room<br>
temperature (~75°F) viscosity is about 10,000,000 poise. To provide the prepreg<br>
tack necessary for assembling prepreg plies for a composite part, a lower<br>
viscosity comonomer or additive is needed. Traditional 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A<br>
comonomer has a viscosity of about 250 poise and has good mechanical and<br>
thermal oxidative performance. Unfortunately, bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a<br>
substantially aromatic radical is not stable when dissolved into 2,2'-diallyl<br>
bisphenol A and readily crystallizes. This crystallization increases the viscosity of<br>
the resin thus, making it difficult to use as a prepreg resin due to the lack of tack.<br>
The present invention resolves this issue by utilizing a comonomer that has low<br>
viscosity, does not crystallize with bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical, and has good thermal and oxidative characteristics.<br>
 The group of bis(alkenylphenoxy) ethers of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical acceptable for the present invention is shown below as Formula<br>
3.<br><br>
Formula 3 - bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially aromatic radical<br>
 Wherein R1, R1' = hydrogen, alkyl, or aromatic; R2, R2'<br>
hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, phenoxy, or alkyloxy; and where X would be a direct<br>
bond or one of the following functional groups:<br><br>
 The bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially aromatic<br>
radical compound can be in an amount up to about 90% by weight of the liquid<br>
component of the resin system and is preferably between about 10% to about<br>
90% and more preferably between about 60% and 80% by weight of the liquid<br>
monomer component. Preferably the bis(alkenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical compound is a bis(propenylphenoxy) ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical and most preferably is 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone<br>
(TM123).<br>
 The present invention is preferably used in combination with<br>
a solid particulate substantially aromatic BMI, preferably for example, MDA-BMI<br>
orTDA-BMI. U.S. Pat, Nos. 5,003,018 and 5,747,615 more fully disclose a slurry<br>
mixing process where some or all of the substantially aromatic BMI's are ground<br>
and added to the resin composition as fine particles.<br>
 The present invention allows for higher total amounts of<br>
substantially aromatic BMI to be incorporated into the formulation. Substantially<br>
aromatic BMI may be from about 20 wt% to about 90 wt% or more of the total<br>
resin formulation, preferably between 50 wt% and 90 wt%, and most preferably<br>
between about 60 wt% and about 75 wt%.<br>
 The particulate BMI is characterized in having an average<br>
particle size of less than 50pm in diameter, preferably where more than 90% by<br>
weight are less than 40pm and most preferably where more than 90% by weight<br>
are less than 20pm.<br>
 A further benefit of the diallyl ether of a substantially<br>
aromatic radical curing agent in the liquid monomer component is that it affords<br>
the option of adding high molecular weight thermoplastics. The present invention<br>
allows for the addition of thermoplastics in the amount of about 1 wt% to about<br>
20 wt%, preferably 1 wt% to about 5 wt% of the total resin formulation.<br>
 The present invention can be used with any BMl resin<br>
system to improve handling characteristics.<br>
 One of the further benefits of the present invention is the<br>
capability of resin transfer molding processing.<br>
 By the term "tack" is meant a property needed when plying<br>
the layers of prepregs together to later compress and heat form into composite<br>
parts and its ability to adhere to itself. Tack on prepreg is mainly a function of the<br>
viscosity of the resin. As the viscosity of the resin is lowered the resin is able to<br>
better wet-out a surface which increases the amount of energy needed to remove<br>
the prepreg. Prepreg tack is a critical physical property of the prepreg and is<br>
needed to make highly contoured parts.<br>
 By the term "drape" is meant a property needed when plying<br>
the layers of prepreg together and is the ability of the prepreg to form into tight<br>
radii needed for complex parts. As with tack, resin viscosity affects prepreg<br>
drape. As the resin viscosity is increased the resin becomes stiffer which<br>
decreases the drape of the prepreg. This make it harder to conform to contours<br>
and in some cases, this lack of drape can trap air and cause porosity.<br>
 By the term "bismaleimide" is also meant the closely related<br>
nadicimides and allylnadicimides. Preferred bismaleimides are the<br>
bismaleimides of toluenediamine, methylenedianiline, aliphatic diamines,<br>
isophorone diamine, and the like. Further examples of suitable bismaleimides<br>
are disclosed in U.S.Pat. Nos. 4,644,039 and 5,003,018. Generally, the<br>
bismaleimides are copolymerized with an alkenylphenol comonomer such as<br>
2,2'-diallylbisphenol A, 2,2'-dipropenylbisphenol A, eugenol, etc. When<br>
bismaleimides are the major thermosetting resin it is frequently desirable to<br>
incorporate a low viscosity epoxy resin, for example a bisphenol F epoxy or<br>
resorcinol based epoxy to the resin system in minor amounts.<br>
 By the term "free radical inhibitor" is meant a compound for<br>
reducing the reactivity of the resin components. Appropriate inhibitors, are<br>
known in the art and the present invention may further incorporate the use of<br>
inhibitors as more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,566.<br>
 By the term "liquid phase component" or "liquid monomer<br>
component" is meant a reactive resin system which is liquid at the slurry mixing<br>
or mixing process temperature. This liquid phase component contains two or<br>
more reactive monomers of the same or different chemical functionalities, cross-<br>
curative monomeric or oligomeric modifiers, or in addition to such components,<br>
other system components such as plasticizers, fillers, pigments, thermoplastic<br>
tougheners, rheology control agents, tackifiers, and the like.<br>
 A myriad of possible liquid monomers exist. The following<br>
types of liquid monomers may be considered as typical, but not limiting.<br>
 Unsaturated polyesters are suitable liquid monomers. These<br>
polyesters must be liquid at the slurry temperature. Such polyesters are<br>
prepared by esterifying a polybasic acid and polyfunctional alcohol at least one of<br>
which contains ethylenic or acetylenic unsaturation. Such polyesters, to have the<br>
lowest melting points, are often synthesized from mixtures of acids and alcohols.<br>
Examples of such unsaturated polyesters may be found in unsaturated<br>
Polyesters by Herman Boenig, Elsevier, New York, 1964. Many commercial<br>
resins of this type are available, often containing other polymerizable species<br>
such as styrene.<br>
 Isocyanates may be suitable liquid monomers. Examples of<br>
suitable isocyanates are the toluene isocyanates, for example 2,4-, and 2,6-<br>
toluenediisocyanates and their mixtures; the diisocyanatodiphenylmethanes, for<br>
example 2,2'-, 2,4'-, 4,4'-, and 3,3'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane and their<br>
mixtures; isophorone diisocyanate, and<br>
polyphenylenepolymethylenepolyisocyanate.<br>
 Bismaleimides may be suitable liquid monomers, particularly<br>
eutectic mixtures of two or more bismaleimides. Such bismaleimides are well<br>
known items of commerce and may be prepared, for example, through the<br>
reaction of maleic anhydride with a suitable di- or polyamine. Useful, for example,<br>
are the maleimides of the toluenediamines, the phylenediamines, the<br>
diaminodiphenylmethanes, diaminodiphenyloxides, diaminodiphenylsulfides,<br>
diaminodiphenysulfones, and their analogues. Also suitable are the maleimides<br>
of amine terminated polyarylene oligomers having interspersed oxide, sulfide,<br>
sulfone, or carbonyl groups as taught by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,175,175,4,656,208<br>
and EP-A-0,130,270.<br>
 Aliphatic bismaleimides of di- and polyamines are also<br>
suitable. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: those derived<br>
from the trimethylhexanediamines (TMH-BMI), hexanediamine (hexamethylene<br>
diamine bismaleimide or HMDA-BMI), octanediamine, decanediamine, 1,4-<br>
diaminocyclohexane, and isophorone diamine and the like.<br>
 Cyanate resins are also suitable liquid monomers. Such<br>
resins are prepared through the reaction of a cyanogen halide with an aromatic<br>
di- or polyol such as recorcinol, hydroquinone, dihydroxynaphthalene, the<br>
cresolic and phenolic novalak, and the various bisphenols. Eutectic mixtures of<br>
such cyanates are also feasible as liquid monomers.<br>
 The above-identified liquid monomers serve to illustrate the<br>
variety of chemical types which are suitable for the practice of the subject<br>
invention. Other monomers having other chemical functional groups which can<br>
meet the requirements of being liquid and substantially unreactive at the slurry<br>
mixing temperatures will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art.<br>
 Mixtures of various liquid monomers may also be used.<br>
Examples of such mixtures include epoxy resins and di-or polyphenols; epoxy<br>
resins and cyanate resins; cyanate resins and bismaleimide resins, and epoxy<br>
resins and isocyanate resins. Such resin mixtures should be capable of mutual<br>
solubility at the slurry mixing temperature; should not react substantially at the<br>
slurry mixing or mixing temperature; and where any of the components are solids,<br>
those components should not be present in an amount appreciably in excess of<br>
the storage temperature solubility of that component, or to such a degree as to<br>
elevate the glass transition temperature of the uncured resin system to<br>
unacceptable levels.<br>
 The liquid phase component reactive monomers may be co-<br>
reactive in that they do not react with each other, but react upon cure with<br>
themselves or other system components, or they may be cross-curative, in that<br>
they react with each other upon reaching the cure temperature. The reactive<br>
monomers of the liquid monomer component, however, must not react to any<br>
substantial degree during the slurry mixing process, or premature advancement<br>
of the resin may occur.<br>
 Modifiers such as the 2,2'-diallybisphenols and the 2,2'-<br>
dipropenylbisphenols, or allylphenoxy, propenylphenoxy, allylphenyl and<br>
propenyphenyl-terminated oligomeric modifiers may also be incorporated into the<br>
liquid monomer component.<br>
 Other ingredients may also be added into the liquid<br>
monomer component. Where such other modifiers are solids, as is the case with<br>
some of the oligomeric modifiers, the quantity contained in the liquid phase must<br>
be such that the storage temperature solubility of the modifier is not appreciably<br>
exceeded.<br>
 By "slurry compatible solid" is meant a reactive solid<br>
monomer or oligomer or a thermoplastic toughener. If the thermoplastic is<br>
soluble, it will be soluble at a temperature higher than the slurry mixing<br>
temperature, but not at the slurry mixing .temperature itself. Alternatively, the<br>
thermoplastic may be substantially soluble at the slurry mixing temperature, but<br>
the slurry process may be performed over a time such that only a minimal<br>
amount of the thermoplastic will dissolve. In either case, the thermoplastic must<br>
be a solid at the slurry mixing temperatures.<br>
 If the slurry compatible solid is a reactive monomer or<br>
oligomer it will have a molecular weight greater than 250 Daltons and preferably<br>
will have the same reactive functionality as the majority of the reactive chemical<br>
monomers in the finished resin system. The reactive slurry compatible solid will<br>
also be chemically and physically compatible with the liquid comonomer in the<br>
sense hereinafter designated.<br>
 By the term "slurry mixing process temperature" is meant<br>
any temperature at which mixing may occur and maintain the intended solid<br>
phase component in substantially the solid phase. This temperature may be<br>
from 70° F to 280° F, preferably about 120° F to about 200° F, and most<br>
preferably between about 140° F and 160° F.<br>
 By the term "mixing process temperature" is meant any<br>
temperature at which mixing may occur and maintain substantially a single liquid<br>
phase of the resin mixture and can similarly be from 70° F to 280° F, preferably<br>
about 120° F to about 200° F, and most preferably between about 140° F and<br>
160° F.<br>
 It is desirable that the reactive monomers will not react to<br>
any substantial degree at the slurry mixing process temperature or mixing<br>
process temperature.<br>
 By the term "epoxy resins" is meant epoxy resins having<br>
functionalities of about two or greater are suitable. Examples of liquid epoxy<br>
resins are contained in many references, such as the treatise Handbook of<br>
Epoxy Resins by Lee and Neville, McGraw-Hill, and Epoxy Resins, Chemistry<br>
and Technology, May, Ed., Marcel Dekker, ©1973. Included among these liquid<br>
systems are many of the DGEBA and DGEBF resins, the lower molecular weight<br>
phenolic and cresolic novalac based resins, and the trisglycidyl aminophenol<br>
resins. Mixtures of these liquid epoxy resins and minor amounts of solid epoxy<br>
resins such as tetraglycidyl methylenedianiline (TGMDA) or other solid epoxy<br>
resins may also be useful. In this case, the amount of solid epoxy resin should<br><br>
be such that neither the storage temperature solubility of the solid epoxy in the<br>
remaining liquid monomers is appreciably exceeded, nor is the glass transition<br>
temperature of the uncured resin system raised to an unacceptably high value.<br>
 Mixtures of epoxy resins and epoxy curing agents which are<br>
soluble in the epoxy and unreactive or poorly reactive at the slurry temperature<br>
may also be used. Examples of such systems are those containing one or more<br>
of the various glycidyl-functional epoxy resins, and aromatic amine curing agents<br>
such as diaminodiphenylmethane, diaminodiphenylsulfide, diaminodiphenyloxide,<br>
and diaminodiphenylsulfone, particularly the latter. However, as some of these<br>
aromatic amines are solids, the same limitation applies to them as applies to<br>
mixtures containing solid epoxies: the amount of solid curing agent dissolved in<br>
the liquid monomer component should be such that the storage temperature<br>
solubility of the curing agent in the remaining liquid monomer components is not<br>
exceeded, and the glass transition temperature of the uncured resin system<br>
should not be raised to unacceptable values.<br>
 By the term "slurry mixing process" is meant a slurry mixing<br>
process under a variety of conditions. Preferably, the slurry compatible solid is<br>
finely ground by conventional methods and dispersed into the additional resin<br>
components by suitable dispersing means. For example, the solid may be ground<br>
to fine particle sizes in a jet mill as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,607,069. Most<br>
preferably, the solid is ground to a particle size less than 50 urn, preferably less<br>
than 40 µm, and most preferably less than 20 urn where more than 90% of the<br>
particles are less than the desired particle size. The finely ground resin may then<br>
be dispersed, for example using a high shear mixer, at temperatures ranging<br>
from below ambient to over 200° C. depending upon the reactivities and<br>
viscosities of the liquid monomer components.<br>
 Alternatively, the slurry compatible solid may be added to the<br>
liquid monomer in small particles ranging from 50 µm, to 3 mm in size, with<br>
further size reduction accomplished by use of high shear mixing. An apparatus<br>
suitable for such high shear size reduction are the ULTRA-TURRAX® mixers<br>
available from IKA-Maschinenbau Janke and Kunke, GMBH and Co. KG., D-<br>
«<br>
7812 Bad Kruzinger 2, Federal Republic of Germany. Such high shear mixers<br>
generate considerable heat, and thus cooling is often necessary to prevent the<br>
slurry mixing temperature from rising so high that the solid dissolves in the liquid<br>
monomers or that premature reaction occurs.<br>
 An additional means of slurry mixing which is possible when<br>
the solid component has a relatively steep solubility curve in the liquid monomers<br>
and does not tend to form supersaturated solutions, is to melt the solid monomer<br>
in a separate container and add it to the liquid monomers while cooling under<br>
high shear. With some systems, it may even be possible to melt all the<br>
components together and cool while mixing under high shear. This method is not<br>
suitable, however, when supersaturation is likely, as the resulting heat-curable<br>
resin system is at most metastable and may alter its morphology in an<br>
unpredictable manner due to crystallization of the supersaturated components.<br>
The temperature of the liquid monomer using this technique, must be below the<br>
solidification temperature of the slurry compatible solid when mixing ceases, and<br>
in such cases, the "slurry mixing temperature" is this latter temperature.<br>
 In any event, following the slurry mixing process, the<br>
resulting resin system consists of a continuous phase containing the liquid<br>
monomer(s) and a discontinuous (solid) phase containing a major portion of the<br>
slurry compatible solid in the form of particles having an average size where<br>
more than 90% by weight are less than about 50 µm, preferably less than 40 µm,<br>
and particularly, less than 20 µm. The particle size of the discontinuous phase<br>
may vary from one system to another, but it is important in the case of<br>
prepregging resins that the mean particle size be less than the distance between<br>
adjacent fiber bundles or filaments.<br>
 By the term "thermoplastics" is meant the preferred<br>
engineering thermoplastics such as the polyimides, polyetherimides,<br>
polyesterimides, polysulfides, polysulfones, polyphenylene oxides,<br>
polyethersulfones, polyetherketones, polyetheretherketones,<br>
polyetherketoneketones, polyketonesulfones, polyamides, polyesters and similar<br>
polymers. Such thermoplastics preferably have glass transition temperatures<br>
greater than 150°C.<br>
 The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the<br>
present invention and are not to be construed as to limiting the scope thereof in<br>
any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following experiment evaluated the amount of crystals that were formed by<br>
replacing the diallyl ether of bisphenol A of the present invention for the traditional 2,2'-<br>
diallyl bisphenol A mixed with bis(propenylphenoxy) ether of an aromatic radical and<br>
slurry mixed in a particulate bismaleimide resin such as MDA-BMI powder.<br>
A first formulation of a prior art resin formulation was made by adding 50 grams of 2,2'-<br>
diallyl bisphenol A at 26.7°C (80°F).. Next, 50 grams of 4,4'- (2-propenylphenoxy)<br>
benzophenone (TM123) was preheated at 76.8°F (170°F) and mixed into the resin. The<br>
temperature of the resulting liquid resin mixture was increased to 93.3°C (200°F). Next,<br>
100 grams of bismalelimide particles (MDA-BMI) was slurry mixed into the liquid resin<br>
mixture. The resulting slurry mixed resin mixture was cooled to room temperature.<br>
A second formulation of the present invention was made by adding 50 grams of diallyl<br>
ether of bisphenol A at 26.7°C (80°F). Next, 50 grams of 4,4'- (2-propenylphenoxy)<br>
benzophenone (TM123) was preheated at 76.7°C (170°F) and mixed into the resin. The<br>
temperature of the resulting liquid resin mixture was increased to 93.3°C (200°F). Next,<br>
100 grams of MDA-BMI was slurry mixed into the liquid resin mixture. The resulting<br>
slurried resin mixture was cooled to room temperature.<br>
Three tests were run on these two slurry mixed resin mixtures to evaluate crystallization<br>
formation. First, the resins were allowed to sit at room temperature with no mixing for<br>
1-2 weeks. Second, the resin mixtures were seeded with 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy)<br>
benzophenone (TM123) crystals and allowed to stand at room temperature with no<br>
mixing for 1-2 weeks. And lastly, the resin mixtures were heated to 71.1°C (160°F) with<br>
no mixing for 2-3 hours.<br>
All three evaluations of the 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A curing agent visually showed a large<br>
amount of crystallization of the resin. This would eliminate the tack on the prepreg.<br>
All three evaluations of the diallyl ether of bisphenol A curing agent visually showed no<br>
crystal formation versus the unacceptable amount of crystal formation using 2,2'-diallyl<br>
bisphenol A curing agent. The only difference was the replacement of diallyl ether of<br>
bisphenol A curing agent for 2,2'-diallyi bisphenol A curing agent.<br>
The evaluations indicated that using diallyl ether of bisphenol A as the curing agent<br>
prevents crystallization and is preferred when used with 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy)<br>
benzophenone (TM123), over 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A curing agent.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The viscosity and tack of prepregs made using a prior art system, a modified version of<br>
a prior art system and the present invention were evaluated to compare the viscosity<br>
and tack of a final prepreg made from each.<br>
A first formulation was made based on the prior art system by adding 74.87 grams of<br>
2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A (Matrimid 5292B marketed by Huntsman) at 87.8°C (190°F) in an<br>
aluminum mixing can. Next, 0.6 grams of 1,4- napthaquinone was mixed into the resin.<br>
Next, 224.53 grams 4,4'-(2- propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123) was mixed into<br>
the resin. The resin was 100% homogenous and dissolved. The resin was cooled to<br>
room temperature.<br>
Room temperature (27°C) viscosity was measured on the uncured neat resin using a<br>
ARES-3 rheometer with the following settings: parallel plate, 25 mm diameter plates, 0.5<br>
mm gap, frequency of 10 rad/s. strain of 50% and time of 10 minutes. The room<br>
temperature viscosity was 100,000 PaS (100,000 poise.)<br>
The resin was stored at room temperature for 2 weeks to evaluate tack stability. Some<br>
opaque crystals were identified visually without magnification as the individuals were on<br>
the order of about 1mm. The resin crystallization on the surface reduced the tack<br>
significantly.<br>
A second formulation was made modifying the prior art resin system by adding 149.7<br>
grams of 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A (Matrimid 5292B) at 87.8°C (190°F) in an aluminum<br>
mixing can. Next, 0.6 grams of 1 ,4-napthaquinone was mixed into the resin. Next,<br>
149.7 grams of 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123) was mixed into the<br>
resin. The resin was 100% homogenous and dissolved. The resin was cooled to room<br>
temperature. The room temperature resin viscosity was 10, 000 PaS (10,000 poise) as<br>
measured above.<br>
The resin was stored at room temperature for 2 weeks to evaluate tack stability. The<br>
crystallization was again visually assessed and the approximately 1mm crystals were<br>
agglomerated to such an extent that the crystallization fully covered the exposed resin<br>
surface. The extent of crystallization reduced tack to an unusable level.<br>
A third formulation was made based on the present invention by adding 74.87 grams of<br>
diallyl ether of bisphenol A (Matrimid 2292) at 87.8°C (190°F) in an aluminum mixing<br>
can. Next, 0.6 grams of 1 ,4-napthaquinone was mixed into the resin. Next, 224.53<br>
grams of 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123) was mixed into the resin.<br>
The resin was 100% homogenous and dissolved. The resin was cooled to room<br>
temperature.<br>
Room temperature (27°C) viscosity was measured on the uncured neat resin. The room<br>
temperature viscosity was 61.5 PaS (615 poise) as measured above.<br>
The resin was stored at room temperature for 2 weeks to evaluate tack stability. The<br>
crystallization was again visually assessed with virtually no crystallization observed. The<br>
tack was stable and virtually unchanged over the two weeks.<br>
Therefore, while the modification of the prior art bismaleimide resin by simply adding<br>
more 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A did further reduce the viscosity of the resulting resin<br>
composition, the addition in fact further impaired the tack due to crystallization making<br>
the resin unusable. In contrast, the resin of the present invention not only significantly<br>
reduced the resin composition viscosity, it also provided optimal tack.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Elevated temperature, thermal durability tests were performed on composites based on<br>
the present invention as well as the prior art system to demonstrate that while the tack<br>
and viscosity of the present invention are superior to the prior art system, there is no<br>
loss in thermal durability performance.<br>
A first comparative formulation was made based on the prior art by adding 134.7 grams<br>
of 2,2'-diallyl bisphenol A (Matrimid 5292B) resin at 87.8°C (190°F) to an aluminum<br>
mixing can. Next, 1.2 grams of 1 ,4-napthaquinone was mixed into the resin. Next,<br>
404.1 grams of 4,4'-(2-propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123) was mixed into the<br>
resin. The resin is 100% homogenous and dissolved at this stage. Next, 660 grams of 20<br>
µm particle size BMI (90% of particles less 20pm in size) was slurry mixed into the resin.<br>
The resin is cooled to room temperature.<br>
The finished resin system was coated onto silicone coated release paper and used to<br>
prepare a carbon/graphite prepreg.<br>
A laminate was made by plying together 8 plies of this prepreg. It was cured using an<br>
autoclave with 5,860.5 hPa (85psi) at 190.6°C (375°F) for 6 hours. A free-standing post-<br>
cure was completed at 226.7°C (440°F) in an oven for 6 hours.<br>
The laminate was cut into 4"x4" samples and put into a 232.2°C (450°F) oven for 4000<br>
hours. The sample was weighed before and after aging after various periods of time<br>
during aging to determine the percent weight loss. The percent weight loss was 2.0%<br>
after 4000 hours.<br>
A second comparative formulation was made based upon the present invention by<br>
adding 134.7 grams of diallyl ether of bisphenol A Matrimid 2292 resin at 87.8°C (190°F)<br>
to an aluminum mixing can. Next, 1.2 grams of 1,4-Napthaquinone was mixed into the<br>
resin. Next, 404.1 grams of 4,4'-(2- propenylphenoxy) benzophenone (TM123) was<br>
mixed into the resin. The resin was 100% homogenous and dissolved at this stage.<br>
Next, 660 grams of 20 µm...................................................................................................<br>
particle size BMI (90% of particles less 20µm in size) was slurry mixed into the resin.<br>
The resin was cooled to room temperature of 27°C.<br>
The finished resin system was coated onto silicone coated release paper and used to<br>
prepare a carbon/graphite prepreg.<br>
A laminate was made by plying together 8 plies of this prepreg. It was cured using an<br>
autoclave with 5,860 hPa (85 psi) at 190.6°C (375°F) for 6 hours. A free-standing post-<br>
cure was completed at 226.7°C (440°F) in an oven for 6 hours.<br>
The laminate was cut into 4"x4" samples and put into a 232.2°C (450°F) oven for 4000<br>
hours. The sample was weighed before and after aging after various periods of time<br>
during aging to determine the percent weight loss. The percent weight loss was 1.9%.<br>
The weight loss of the First Formulation and the Second Formulation at various times<br>
during the aging test are shown in Table A below.<br>
The viscosity of the First Formulation and the Second Formulation at about room<br>
temperature are shown in Table B.<br>
