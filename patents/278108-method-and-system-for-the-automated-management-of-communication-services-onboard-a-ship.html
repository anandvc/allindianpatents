				<td>Method and system for the automated mar|apetnent of coipinufiicq^Hon services oiifebard a   ',<br>
The present invention relates to the management of telecommunicatioii'siarvjp^s.on-board a naval unit and, more specifically, to a method and a system fof the dutbnlated jnanagenidit of the telecommunication services envisaged.by a pred^ermJIl^ communications plan.   -    .<br>
In connection with the operativity of a naval fle«?t dWng-'a.missipq; it is iiedessary jtp<br>
specify and use a common communicatiohs plan which i^ows direct intkactidn between<br>

the various naval units and odier stations or units, for.exa|&amp;;|le;l8aid bases; air ^ppQrt umts<br>
and the like.<br>
This communications plan envisages the .definition^of a plurality of communicatiqiis services which can be provided by means of la bundle bf.a^a];atus ^^ith diffCTMit characteristics, comprising data and voice sqrviceis in the'VHF; UflF, HF,.SHF or IjHF SAT bands, in encrypted or unmcrypfed foiin, whidi miist bie activated ra^idlyj i.e; within' a few seconds. These services, must be provided using the. limited communications resources of a naval unit and, if necessaty, the simultaneoiis, use of 1he?e resoxirdBs, together with any equipment &amp;ults, must alsd be managed.    '<br>
At present a manual tedmique is used for activating/Fe^v&amp;tiii;g the comm.uniciBCti'(J»s services, this technique having tiie disadvantage.that itdcpist be based on memorisatipn of .the chosen configurations of the appatatus (chains df devicteis ajid/or apparatuii in liie transmission and reception channel's) by the operator ai^dotfiqanual calculation using. ^ heuristic process or a tentative approach, of the conJSgiratibn'Jmo^ appropriate, for ea^ particular transmission anid findt situation fiom among tije' many pojisibld configprations..<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method'and a-systtai adapted to allow the automated management of the commiinications services on-board-a ship, and; in particular adapted to perform analyses and predictions as to'thifetisibility arid the method of implementing these services;<br>

It is also taken into account the cunrent operating state of'the.syst.en^namely knowledge of the presence of apparatus already used by active services,'the presence of apparatus wtich are not available because they are faulty or inaccessible, etc.<br>
