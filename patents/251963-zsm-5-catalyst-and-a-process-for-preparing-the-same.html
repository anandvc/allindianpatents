				<td>ZSM-5 ADDITIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to improved ZSM-5-containing microspheres<br>
produced by spray drying kaolin slurries containing ZSM-5 and calcining the<br>
product to form attrition-resistant microspheres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that kaolin can be formed into particles, alone or with<br>
other ingredients such as particles of zeolitic molecular sieve, to form<br>
coherent bodies such as microspheres which, when calcined, are further<br>
hardened. For example, essentially catalytically inert microspheres adapted to<br>
be used in a selective vaporization process or to be blended with active<br>
zeolite particles are produced by spray drying a slurry of hydrous (uncalcined)<br>
kaolin arid calcining the resulting microspheres. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,781,818,<br>
Reagan, et al. Microspheres consisting of calcined kaolin and impregnated<br>
with precious metal have been commercially used to promote CO combustion<br>
in fluid catalytic cracking units. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,171,286, Dight, et al. In<br>
some cases, the promoter particles are preblended with particles containing<br>
an active cracking catalyst component (usually zeolite Y). In other<br>
applications, the promoter particles are introduced at a suitable level into the<br>
regenerator of an FCC unit, separately from the particles of cracking catalyst.<br>
Still another use of microspheres composed of calcined kaolin is as a reactant<br>
with caustic or sodium silicate solution to form zeolitic cracking catalyst by so-<br>
called in-situ routes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,902, Brown, et al.<br>
Many cracking catalysts are prepared by mixing a slurry of previously formed<br>
crystals of zeolite Y in appropriate ion-exchange form with silica sol or silica<br>
alumina sol and kaolin followed by spray drying. Spray dried microspheres of<br>
calcined clay may also be used as a fluidization additive in FCC units.<br>
In carrying out various processes in which an aqueous slurry of kaolin<br>
is spray dried, it is conventional to disperse the kaolin in the slurry prior to<br><br>
spray drying in order to permit the formation of high solids slurries that are<br>
sufficiently fluid to be spray dried. High solids are preferred for economic<br>
reasons. Also, higher solids are conducive to the formation of more strongly<br>
bonded particles. To disperse kaolin in water, conventional anionic clay<br>
dispersants such as sodium condensed phosphate salts, sodium silicates,<br>
soda ash, sodium polyacrylate and mixtures thereof are used. Typically, the<br>
pH of concentrated dispersed slurries of kaolin are mildly alkaline to neutral,<br>
e.g., 6.0 to 8.0, with pH 7 being optimum.<br>
In many catalytic processes, such as FCC processes, the particles<br>
must be attrition-resistant as well as sufficiently porous. Generally, one of<br>
these qualities is achieved at the expense of the other. For example, as a<br>
particle of given chemical composition is formulated to be highly porous, the<br>
hardness usually decreases.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,190,902, Demmel, utilizes the addition of phosphoric<br>
acid (or other phosphate compounds) with kaolin in a spray drying process to<br>
produce spray dried microspheres which are then calcined. In some<br>
formulations zeolite particles are present in the spray dryer feed. The process<br>
is carried out in one of two basic ways. In one, the slurry of clay particles is<br>
brought to a low pH, e.g., 1.0 to 3.0 before being mixed with a source of<br>
phosphorus, followed by spray drying. In the other, the clay slurry is brought<br>
to a high pH level (e.g., 14.0 to 10.0) before mixing with phosphate-containing<br>
compound. According to the teachings of this patent, use of these pH ranges<br>
is necessary for the production of particles with superior attrition resistance. A<br>
significant problem with these prior art approaches to producing calcined clay<br>
microspheres is that neither pH range is the mildly alkaline to neutral pH<br>
range at which concentrated slurries of kaolin are fluid and amenable to<br>
commercial spray drying using high solids slurries. Thus, the patentee diluted<br>
the original 70% solids slurry to 40% before pH adjustment apparently<br>
because of viscosity increases which follow formation of the aluminum<br>
phosphate binder.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,064, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,643, both<br>
Absil, et al, describe formation of a cracking catalyst by spray drying a slurry<br><br>
of zeolite with a slurry of clay treated with a phosphorus source at a pH less<br>
than 3. Sufficient water is added to bring the combined slurries to a low solids<br>
content of ca. 25%.<br>
The use of aluminum phosphates as a binder and hardening agent is<br>
well known in the ceramics industry (F. J. Gonzalez and J. W. Halloran,<br>
Ceram. Bull 59(7), 727 (1980)). This usually involves addition of alumina to<br>
the ceramic mix, followed by treatment with phosphoric acid, curing and firing.<br>
Similarly, the hardening of aluminous masses such as those composed of<br>
bauxite or kaolin by incorporation of phosphoric acid followed by heat<br>
treatment also is known. The product of this treatment is apparently an<br>
aluminum phosphate which can act as a binder. An aluminum phosphate<br>
formed by interaction of phosphoric acid solution with an aluminum salt<br>
solution has been used to bind zeolite and clay in a cracking catalyst<br>
composition (U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,412).<br>
Commonly assigned U.S. 5,521,133 discloses forming improved<br>
porous microspheres based on spray dried calcined kaolin. The phosphoric<br>
acid and kaolin are pumped in separate streams to a static mixer that is<br>
adjacent to the atomizer of a spray dryer. The phosphoric acid is injected into<br>
a dispersed high solids kaolin slurry and the slurry is virtually instantaneously<br>
atomized into droplets in a spray dryer. The term "virtually instantaneously" as<br>
used therein refers to a time less than about 20 seconds, preferably less than<br>
about 10 seconds. This spray drying technique eliminates undesirable kaolin<br>
flocculation and agglomeration prior to the spray dryer.<br>
Kaolin flocculation and agglomeration prior to the spray dryer would<br>
result in relatively large clay particle aggregates in the spray dryer feed. The<br>
presence of these large aggregates cause poor and uneven packing of the<br>
kaolin particles in the microspheres resulting from the spray drying process.<br>
Poor and uneven packing of kaolin particles in microspheres leads to<br>
insufficient interparticle binding of the particles within the microspheres. This<br>
results in poor physical properties including poor attrition resistance.<br>
In contrast, the process of U.S. 5,521,133 provides microspheres<br>
which have good kaolin interparticle binding and excellent physical and<br><br>
chemical properties. For example, microspheres produced by the patented<br>
process have high attrition resistance. In addition, the microspheres retain<br>
higher porosity than microspheres from the same kaolin that are spray dried<br>
without phosphoric acid binder and are calcined to the same temperature.<br>
This porosity increase coupled with higher attrition resistance is surprising<br>
since, generally, an increase in porosity leads to a decrease in attrition<br>
resistance. Sufficient porosity is also important because the physical<br>
properties of the microspheres should be comparable to those of<br>
microspheres containing the active zeolitic catalytic component, i.e., very low<br>
or very high densities are undesirable.<br>
Microspheres prepared by using principles of U.S. 5,521,133 have<br>
several applications in FCC including: catalytically inert microspheres having<br>
a high attrition resistance; active cracking component (by adding zeolite to the<br>
clay slurry); microspheres (with or without added components such as MgO)<br>
that preferentially react with contaminant vanadium; microspheres for in-situ<br>
zeolite growth (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,902, Brown et al);<br>
fluidization additive and catalytic support for a carbon monoxide combustion<br>
additive.<br>
An FCC additive containing kaolin and 10-25% by weight ZSM-5 has<br>
been used to improve gasoline octane and to enhance LPG yields. To further<br>
increase LPG while minimizing unit activity loss due to dilution, additives with<br>
ZSM-5 levels greater than 25% are required. Unfortunately, in microsphere<br>
additives that contain higher than 25% ZSM-5 levels the attrition resistance of<br>
the microspheres becomes an issue. An objective of this invention is to make<br>
an FCC additive containing at least 40% by weight ZSM-5 with the attrition<br>
resistance and with an activity similar or better, compared on the per unit<br>
ZSM-5, than the additive containing 25% ZSM-5 or less.<br>
W.R. Grace has a U.S. published patent application, U.S.<br>
2003/0047487, for making additives containing 40-80% ZSM-5 with good<br>
attrition resistance. As described therein, the amount of added alumina in the<br>
microsphere formulation needs to be less than 10% and the total alumina<br>
(added alumina plus alumina in clay and zeolite) is less than 30%. The added<br><br>
alumina has a BET surface area greater than 50 m2/g, preferably greater than<br>
140 m2/g. In their process, clay, zeolite, alumina, and binders such as<br>
phosphoric acid and aluminum chlorohydrol are all mixed together to form a<br>
uniform slurry prior to spray drying.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that when at least a portion of<br>
the microsphere contains particles of high density, low surface area<br>
unreactive species, microspheres containing 30% or more ZSM-5 possess<br>
high activity per unit ZSM-5 and superior attrition resistance compared to<br>
microspheres without such low surface area unreactive species.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, an FCC additive containing at least<br>
30% ZSM-5 and which has good attrition resistance is provided by improving<br>
the process as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. 5,521,133. In<br>
accordance with the process of the present invention, a high solids kaolin<br>
slurry is mixed with a slurry containing ZSM-5 and a low surface area alumina<br>
or similar high density, non-reactive inorganic material. The mixed slurry and<br>
phosphoric acid are pumped in separate streams to a static mixture adjacent<br>
to the atomizer of a spray dryer. Thus, the phosphoric acid is injected into the<br>
dispersed high solids mixed kaolin slurry and the acid-injected slurry is<br>
atomized into droplets in a spray dryer. The process provides microspheres<br>
which have good kaolin interparticle binding and excellent physical and<br>
chemical properties. Moreover, the microspheres can contain at least 30 wt.<br>
% ZSM-5 and due to the addition of the unreactive alumina or other high<br>
density, unreactive inorganic material, have high attrition resistance.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FCC catalysts are often blends of microspheres containing a<br>
catalytically active component (microspheres containing zeolite Y) and<br>
additives (microspheres composed of highly calcined kaolin with low surface<br>
area, with and without zeolite). During the process of fluid cracking, the<br>
catalyst components attrit forming fines. While formation of fines generally is<br><br>
considered undesirable, formation of particles less than 2.6 microns<br>
(microfines) is considered particularly undesirable as these can lead to<br>
operational problems in some FCC units while fines less than 2 microns can<br>
be important contributors to stack opacity problems.<br>
Both active and inactive catalyst particles attrit. However, microfine<br>
production from insufficiently bound additives may be significantly (2 to 5<br>
times) more severe than from active components.<br>
The attrition resistance of an FCC catalyst or additive can be assessed<br>
by a laboratory test (sometimes referred to as a Roller attrition test) described<br>
in U.S. 5,082,814, the entire content of which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference. The preferred value for an FCC catalyst additive is less than 15%<br>
fines generation.<br>
In the practice of this invention, the solids of the kaolin slurry should be<br>
kept above 50% (wt.) to insure that the process is economical. Also low solids<br>
drying results in an increase in porosity which can impair attrition resistance of<br>
the final product. Any dispersant can be used provided the kaolin is fluid<br>
(pumpable). Mixtures of soda ash and sodium polyacrylate in various ratios,<br>
e.g., 20:80 to 80:20 (weight basis) are preferred. Kaolin solids content and<br>
slurry weight are provided so as to yield a hydrous kaolin content in the<br>
formed microsphere ranging from about 15 to 50 wt. %, more typically, 25 to<br>
40 wt. %.<br>
The active catalytic zeolite such as ZSM-5 can be incorporated into the<br>
kaolin slurry by mixing therewith an aqueous slurry of the zeolite catalyst.<br>
While ZSM-5 is preferred, other known shape-selective zeolites useful for<br>
FCC are known and are characterized by an intermediate pore size (e.g., pore<br>
size of from about 4 to about 7 angstroms). Besides ZSM-5, ZSM-11 can also<br>
be used. Methods for preparing the intermediate pore ZSM zeolite catalysts<br>
are well known in the art. The ZSM-5 catalyst is preferably prepared in an<br>
aqueous slurry containing from 10-40 % by weight solids. Sufficient ZSM-5 is<br>
provided to yield a microsphere that contains at least 30 wt. % of the catalytic<br>
active component. Amounts of at least 40 wt. % are preferred.<br><br>
Prior to mixing the ZSM-5 slurry with the kaolin slurry, it is preferred to<br>
add alumina or other inorganic components into the catalytic slurry. The<br>
alumina or like inorganic components can be characterized as inactive<br>
components and have a low BET surface area and high density. Typically,<br>
the alumina or inorganic component which is added to the catalytic slurry will<br>
have a BET surface area of less than 50 m2/g and a density greater than 2.8<br>
g/cc. Preferably the high density unreactive component will have a BET<br>
surface area less than 25 m2/g and a density greater than 3.0 g/cc. Most<br>
preferably the high density unreactive component will have a BET surface<br>
area less than 25 m2/g and a density greater than 3.5 g/cc. By density it is<br>
meant the solid or crystal density of the solid material excluding pores having<br>
a diameter of greater than 20 angstroms. Examples of the inactive<br>
components include alpha-alumina and inorganic oxides or silicates such as<br>
zirconia, titania, zirconium silicate, mullite, metal carbides such as silicon<br>
carbide, metal nitrides such as silicon nitride, and other inorganic materials<br>
which have the desired low surface area and high density. Typically these<br>
materials can be added in solid form into the ZSM-5-containing catalytic<br>
slurry. Levels of the inactive component are such as to provide a final level of<br>
unreactive alumina or other unreactive component in the microsphere in<br>
amounts ranging from 3-25 weight %, more typically from about 4-10 % by<br>
weight.<br>
Optionally added to the microspheres of the present invention can be<br>
reactive alumina species. These reactive alumina species are typically added<br>
to the ZSM-5 catalytic slurry and are characterized as having a total surface<br>
area (BET) of greater than 50 m2/g. Preferably, reactive aluminas of much<br>
higher surface areas of from about 140 to 400 m2/g can be used. These<br>
reactive aluminas can typically include boehmite including dispensable<br>
boehmite (sometimes referred to as pseudoboehmite), gibbsite, and other<br>
transitional aluminas. Particularly useful is a dispersable boehmite which<br>
forms fine particles in acid such as formic acid. Thus, the dispersable<br>
boehmite can be first dispersed in an aqueous solution of acid and then<br>
added to the ZSM-5 catalyst slurry. Levels of the reactive high surface area<br><br>
alumina which can be added include levels that will provide from about 2-20<br>
wt. % of the reactive alumina in the final microsphere. Typical amounts of the<br>
reactive alumina will range from 4-8 wt. %. The total weight of alumina,<br>
whether active or inactive, which can be added to and form, part of the<br>
microsphere of this invention can range from at least 5 wt. % and typically will<br>
range from about 8-25 wt.%. A total alumina content, not including the<br>
alumina of the kaolin or the zeolite, in other words the amount of alumina in<br>
the form of added unreactive and reactive alumina, in amounts of greater than<br>
10%, have been found most useful, including amounts of from about 12-20 wt.<br>
%.<br>
The phosphoric acid is preferably added as a concentrated solution;<br>
thus, minimal dilution of the dispersed kaolin slurry takes place when acid is<br>
injected. Thus, the phosphoric acid concentration can be from 5 to 80% by<br>
weight; 50 to 80% concentrations are preferred. The amount of P added can<br>
vary widely depending on the particle size of the kaolin and the hardness that<br>
is desired. For cost reasons, it is generally preferred to minimize the<br>
phosphoric acid content consistent with the desired physical and chemical<br>
properties. Satisfactory results have been attained using sufficient phosphoric<br>
acid to produce products analyzing 3-15% P2O5, expressed on a volatile free<br>
weight basis. Microsphere products containing 7-15% P2O5 are typical.<br>
Calcination can be carried out in a standard laboratory high<br>
temperature oven. Alternatively, the calcination can be carried out on a large<br>
scale in a rotary kiln or other commercial scale calciner.<br>
The temperature to which the material is calcined depends on the<br>
desired levels of attrition resistance and porosity which, in turn, will depend on<br>
the intended end use, the particle size of the kaolin and the % phosphate<br>
binder employed. For example, if the kaolin is a fine clay (95% 
and the binder level is ca. 7% (as P2O5), a calcination temperature of at least<br>
about 1800° F is required. For a coarser clay (80% 
level of binder, a temperature of about 2100° F is required to achieve the<br>
same level of attrition resistance. Overall, a temperature range from about<br>
1200° - 2200° F is appropriate, with a range of 1500° - 2100° F preferred.<br><br>
Time at temperature is important only insofar as sufficient time must be<br>
provided for the entire mass being calcined to reach the desired calcination<br>
temperature. Thus, adequate heating can be accomplished in relatively short<br>
times provided samples are small. Conversely, if the temperature selected is<br>
too low, extending the calcination time has no beneficial effect.<br>
Kaolin particle size distribution is an important consideration in the<br>
preparation of suitable microspheres. If the kaolin particle size is too large<br>
compared to the microsphere diameter, then particle packing within the<br>
microspheres will be non-uniform and interparticle binding among kaolin<br>
particles will be insufficient to achieve the desired physical properties such as<br>
attrition resistance. Using a kaolin consisting predominantly of fine particles<br>
will give more uniform packing of the particles within the microsphere and<br>
better opportunity for interparticle binding. The types of kaolin used in the<br>
examples are listed below along with a conventional measure of fineness, the<br>
wt % 
 <br>
The additive of this invention is suitable for any chemical reaction<br>
involving a hydrocarbon feed requiring catalyst to facilitate the reaction. Such<br>
reactions include hydrocarbon conversion processes involving molecular<br>
weight reduction of a hydrocarbon, e.g., cracking. The invention can also be<br>
employed in isomerization, dimerization, polymerization, hydration and<br>
aromatization. The conditions of such processes are known in the art. See<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,235 incorporated herein by reference. Other applicable<br>
processes include upgradings of reformate, transalkylation of aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatics and reduction in the pour point of fuel<br><br>
oils. For the purposes of this invention, "hydrocarbon feedstock" not only<br>
includes organic compounds containing carbon and hydrogen atoms, but also<br>
includes hydrocarbons comprising oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms.<br>
The feedstocks can be those having a wide range of boiling temperatures,<br>
e.g., naphtha, distillate, vacuum gas oil and residual oil. Such feedstocks also<br>
include those for making heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine.<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for fluidized processes, e.g., in<br>
which catalyst attrition is a factor. The invention is especially suitable for<br>
fluidized catalytic cracking of a hydrocarbon feed to a mixture of products<br>
comprising gasoline, alkylate, potential alkylate, and lower olefins, in the<br>
presence of conventional cracking catalyst under catalytic cracking conditions.<br>
Typical hydrocarbons, i.e., feedstock, to such processes may include in<br>
whole or in part, a gas oil (e.g., light, medium, or heavy gas oil) having an<br>
initial boiling point above about 204° C, a 50% point of at least about 260° C,<br>
and an end point of at least about 315° C. The feedstock may also include<br>
deep cut gas oil, vacuum gas oil, thermal oil, residual oil, cycle stock, whole<br>
top crude, tar sand oil, shale oil, synthetic fuel, heavy hydrocarbon fractions<br>
derived from the destructive hydrogenation of coal, tar, pitches, asphalts,<br>
hydrotreated feedstocks derived from any of the foregoing, and the like. As<br>
will be recognized, the distillation of higher boiling petroleum fractions above<br>
about 400° C must be carried out under vacuum in order to avoid thermal<br>
cracking. The boiling temperatures utilized herein are expressed in terms of<br>
convenience of the boiling point corrected to atmospheric pressure. Resids or<br>
deeper cut gas oils having an end point of up to about 700° C, even with high<br>
metals contents, can also be cracked using the invention.<br>
Catalytic cracking units are generally operated at temperatures from<br>
about 400° C to about 650° C, usually from about 450° C to about 600° C, and<br>
under reduced, atmospheric, or superatmospheric pressure, usually from<br>
about atmospheric to about 5 atmospheres.<br>
An FCC catalyst (primary or additive) is added to a FCC process as a<br>
powder (20-200 microns) and generally is suspended in the feed and<br>
propelled upward in a reaction zone. A relatively heavy hydrocarbon<br><br>
feedstock, e.g., a gas oil, is admixed with a catalyst to provide a fluidized<br>
suspension and cracked in an elongated reactor, or riser, at elevated<br>
temperatures to provide a mixture of lighter hydrocarbon products. The<br>
gaseous reaction products and spent catalyst are discharged from the riser<br>
into a separator, e.g., a cyclone unit, located within the upper section of an<br>
enclosed stripping vessel, or stripper, with the reaction products being<br>
conveyed to a product recovery zone and the spent catalyst entering a dense<br>
catalyst bed within the lower section of the stripper. After stripping entrained<br>
hydrocarbons from the spent catalyst, the catalyst is conveyed to a catalyst<br>
regenerator unit. The fluidizable catalyst is continuously circulated between<br>
the riser and the regenerator and serves to transfer heat from the latter to the<br>
former thereby supplying the thermal needs of the cracking reaction which is<br>
endothermic.<br>
Gas from the FCC main-column overhead receiver is compressed and<br>
directed for further processing and separation to gasoline and light olefins,<br>
with C3 and C4 product olefins being directed to a petrochemical unit or to an<br>
alkylation unit to produce a high octane gasoline by the reaction of an<br>
isoparaffin (usually iso-butane) with one or more of the low molecular weight<br>
olefins (usually propylene and butylene). Ethylene would be recovered in a<br>
similar fashion and processed to additional petrochemical units.<br>
The FCC conversion conditions include a riser top temperature of from<br>
about 500° C to about 595° C, preferably from about 5200° C to about 565° C,<br>
and most preferably from about 530° C to about 550° C; catalyst/oil weight<br>
ratio of from about 3 to about 12, preferably from about 4 to about 11, and<br>
most preferably from about 5 to about 10; and catalyst residence time of from<br>
about 0.5 to about 15 seconds, preferably from about 1 to about 10 seconds.<br>
The catalyst of this invention is suitable as a catalyst alone, or as an<br>
additive to cracking processes which employ conventional large-pore<br>
molecular sieve component. The same applies for processes other than<br>
cracking processes. When used as an additive the catalyst of this invention is<br>
typically present in an amount between about 0.1% by weight and 30% by<br>
weight of the total catalyst inventory, and more typically in an amount between<br><br>
about 1 % by weight and 15% by weight of the total. Cracking catalysts are<br>
large pore materials having pore openings of greater than about 7 Angstroms<br>
in effective diameter. Conventional large-pore molecular sieve include zeolite<br>
X (U.S. Pat. No. 2,882,442); REX; zeolite Y {U.S. Pat. No. 3,130,007);<br>
Ultrastable Y (USY) (U.S. Pat. No. 3,449,070); Rare Earth exchanged Y<br>
(REY) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,415,438); Rare Earth exchanged USY (REUSY);<br>
Dealuminated Y (DeAl Y) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,442,792 and 4,331,694);<br>
Ultrahydrophobic Y (UHPY) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,556); and/or dealuminated<br>
silicon-enriched zeolites, e.g., LZ-210 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,678,765). Preferred are<br>
higher silica forms of zeolite Y. ZSM-20 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,972,983); zeolite<br>
Beta (U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,069); zeolite L (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,216,789 and<br>
4,701,315); and naturally occurring zeolites such as faujasite, mordenite and<br>
the like may also be used (with all patents above in parentheses incorporated<br>
herein by reference). These materials may be subjected to conventional<br>
treatments, such as impregnation or ion exchange with rare earths to increase<br>
stability, in current commercial practice most cracking catalysts contain these<br>
large-pore molecular sieves. The preferred molecular sieve of those listed<br>
above is a zeolite Y, more preferably an REY, USY or REUSY. NapthaMax®<br>
catalyst from Engelhard Corp. is a particularly suitable large pore catalyst.<br>
Methods for making these zeolites are known in the art.<br>
Other large-pore crystalline molecular sieves include pillared silicates<br>
and/or clays; aluminophosphates, e.g., ALPO4-5, ALPO4-8, VPI-5;<br>
silicoaluminophosphates, e.g., SAPO-5, SAPO-37, SAPO-40, MCM-9; and<br>
other metal aluminophosphates. Mesoporous crystalline material for use as<br>
the molecular sieve includes MCM-41. These are variously described in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,310,440; 4,440,871; 4,554,143; 4,567,029; 4,666,875; 4,742,033;<br>
4,880,611; 4,859,314; 4,791,083; 5,102,643; and 5,098,684, each<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The large-pore molecular sieve catalyst component may also include<br>
phosphorus or a phosphorus compound for any of the functions generally<br>
attributed thereto, such as, for example, attrition resistance, stability, metals<br>
passivation, and coke make reduction.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of a ZSM-5 additive in accordance with the present<br>
invention was as follows:<br>
ZSM-5 having a SiO2:AI2O3 of 26 was added to deionized water to<br>
obtain a 25% (by weight) solids slurry and milled to a particle size of 90% 
microns. The resultant slurry solids content after milling via a Premier Mill<br>
was 17%.<br>
Another slurry was prepared by adding Sasol Catapal™ B brand<br>
boehmite type alumina to deionized water to obtain 20 wt. % solids. The<br>
alumina was dispersed by adjusting slurry pH to 4.0 using nitric acid while<br>
mixing. Nine hundred ninety three (993) grams of the resultant (20.6% solids)<br>
Catapal™ B slurry was added to 5.63 kg of 17% ZSM-5 slurry and mixed.<br>
To the resultant ZSM-5/alumina slurry, 193 grams of Nabaltec<br>
Nabalox™ 313 alpha alumina powder was added while mixing.<br>
Engelhard's ASP®-200 kaolin was slurried in water to 50% solids and<br>
dispersed with TSPP. A portion (1743 grams) of the kaolin slurry was added<br>
to the mixed ZSM-5/ alumina slurry using a high shear mixer.<br>
The ZSM-5/alumina/kaolin slurry was spray dried into microspheres<br>
using a pressure nozzle spray dryer with the metered addition of 28%<br>
orthophosphoric acid solution via an in-line mixer at an acid/slurry ratio of<br>
0.169 to target 12% P2O5 on the final product.<br>
The spray dried product was muffle calcined at 1250°F for 30 minutes<br>
at a bed depth of 1.5 to 2 inches. The composition of the microsphere is<br>
shown in Table 1 below.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation:<br>
ZSM-5 as used above in Example 1 and having a SiO2:Al2O3 of 26 was<br>
added to deionized water to obtain a 25% (by weight) solids slurry and milled<br>
to a particle size of 90% 
milling via a Premiere Mill was 19.9%.<br><br>
Another slurry was prepared by adding Sasol Catapal™ B brand<br>
boehmite type alumina to deionized water to obtain 22 wt. % solids. The<br>
alumina was dispersed by adjusting slurry pH to 4.0 using nitric acid while<br>
mixing. Nine hundred twenty (920) grams of the resultant (22.3% solids)<br>
Catapal™ B slurry was added to 4.86 kg of 19.9% ZSM-5 slurry and mixed.<br>
Engelhard's ASP®-200 kaolin was slurried in water to 54% solids and<br>
dispersed with TSPP. A portion (2043 grams) of the kaolin slurry was added<br>
to the mixed ZSM-5/ alumina slurry using a high shear mixer.<br>
The ZSM-5/alumina/kaolin slurry was spray dried into microspheres<br>
using a pressure nozzle spray dryer with the metered addition of 28%<br>
orthophosphoric acid solution via an in-line mixer at an acid/slurry ratio of<br>
0.162 to target 12% P2O5 on the final product.<br>
The spray dried product was muffle calcined at 1250°F for 30 minutes<br>
at a bed depth of 1.5 to 2 inches. The composition of the microsphere is<br>
shown in Table 1 below.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
A commercially available, Engelhard FCC catalyst additive containing<br>
25% by weight ZSM-5 was provided. The composition of the commercial<br>
microsphere is shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Chemical properties of the spray-dried ZSM-5 additives described<br>
above and the activity thereof for propylene formation are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
It can be seen the microsphere of Example 1 containing alpha-alumina<br>
had improved roller attrition over Comparative Example 1 without alpha-<br>
alumina, and had equivalent attrition resistance as Comparative Example 2,<br>
although a significantly higher level of ZSM-5 was provided.<br>
Propylene yield was measured on an ACE fluid-bed hydrocarbon<br>
cracking unit using a gas-oil feed. The catalyst used was comprised of 90%<br>
FCC catalyst (containing zeolite Y), 3% additive of Example 1 and<br><br>
Comparative Example 1, or 4.8% of additive of Comparative Example 2 (to<br>
achieve equal ZSM-5 content in the blend relative to the other examples), and<br>
balance with an inert kaolin microsphere. All catalyst components and<br>
additives were steamed at 1500° F for 4 hours/100% steam prior to testing.<br>
Baseline propylene (without additive) yield at 75 wt. % conversion provided a<br>
5.0 wt. % propylene yield. Propylene Delta was calculated by substracting the<br>
baseline propylene yield (5%) from the propylene yields of the catalysts of the<br>
examples.<br><br>
