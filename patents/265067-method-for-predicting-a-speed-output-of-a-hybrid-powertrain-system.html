CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/986,094 filed on 11/07/2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art. [0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices, including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br><br><br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the powertrain, including controlling transmission operating range state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange among the electrical energ) storage device and the electric machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and rotational speed.<br>
[0005] Signal inputs into the control system may contain noise or be time delayed, therefore predicting control system inputs may improve powertrain performance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A powertrain includes an electro-mechanical transmission coupled to an internal combustion engine and first and second electric machines to transmit power to an output member. A method for controlling the powertrain includes determining an operator torque request, determining a time-based derivative of the operator torque request, determining a first future time, and predicting a change in the operator torque request based upon the operator torque request, the time-based derivative of the operator torque request, and the first future time.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, FIGS. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electromechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br><br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to herein as T|, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as Ni, NA, and NB, respectively.<br>
[0015] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12. Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine torque, can differ from the input speed Nj and the input torque Ti to the transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown). [0016] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets 24,26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e., clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br><br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0017] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0018] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor (not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br><br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator, thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively. [0019] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft, which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in FIG. 1. The output power at the output member 64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed N0 and an output torque To. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels 93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHU the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control module system described with respect to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0020] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (Ti, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br><br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in response to the motor torques TA and TB- Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0021] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB. The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br><br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31 respectively.<br>
[0022] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface ('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0023] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br><br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown). [0024] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TAand TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br><br>
[0025] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bidirectional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, Ti, provided to the transmission 10 at that instant in time based upon monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input speed, Ni. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown. [0026] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br><br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to selectively actuate the various clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow. [0027] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature, and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX-[0028] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93. The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based thereon.<br>
[0029] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM 21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br><br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5,25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0030] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'), and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0031] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the table and indicates which of the specific clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch CI 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or OFF ('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description, when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission 10, i.e., Ni/N0. A first fixed gear operation ('G1') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br><br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0032] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque from the transmission 10 to the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14, clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow. [0033] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br><br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10 required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0034] FIG. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and managing torque and power flow in a powertrain system having multiple<br><br>
torque generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid powertrain system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned control modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The control system architecture can be applied to any powertrain system having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain system having a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain system having multiple electric machines, and non-hybrid powertrain systems. [0035] The control system architecture of FIG. 3 depicts a flow of pertinent signals through the control modules. In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request ('To_req'). Operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed and the operator torque request, and optimized based upon other operating parameters of the hybrid powertrain including battery power limits and response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle.<br>
[0036] The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and Engine Start/Stop') 320 to command changes in the transmission operation ('Transmission Commands') including changing the<br><br>
operating range state. This includes commanding execution of a change in the operating range state if the preferred operating range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('NiProf) can be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle. The engine operating commands and the operator torque request are based upon the input speed profile during a transition in the operating range state of the transmission.<br>
[0037] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also include engine states including one of an all-cylinder state and a cylinder deactivation state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and a fuel cutoff state.<br>
[0038] A clutch torque ('Tel') for each of the clutches is estimated in the TCM 17, including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches, and a present engine input torque ('Ti') reacting with the input member 12 is determined in the ECM 23. An output and motor torque<br><br>
determination scheme ('Output and Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred output torque from the powertrain (To_cmd'), which includes motor torque commands ('TA',' 'TB') for controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred output torque is based upon the estimated clutch torque(s) for each of the clutches, the present input torque from the engine 14, the present operating range state, the input speed, the operator torque request, and the input speed profile. The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled through the TPIM 19 to meet the preferred motor torque commands based upon the preferred output torque. The output and motor torque determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0039] FIG. 4 graphically illustrates a method 500 for predicting the rotational speed output of the output member 64. The order of execution of the steps described herein includes determining a preferred operating range state based upon operating conditions. Actuating the clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 and engine start/stop operation takes an elapsed time in the order of 250 to 500 milliseconds. Commanding and executing a change in the input torque from the engine 14 takes an elapsed time in the order of 50 - 100 milliseconds. Commanding and executing a change in motor torques from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 takes an elapsed time in the order of less than 50 milliseconds. Torque damping may be used to minimize driveline disturbances. As each of the steps are executed, additional real-time parametric feedback data is used to calculate outputs from the strategic control<br><br>
scheme 310, the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320, the tactical control scheme 330, and the output and motor torque determination scheme 340.<br>
[0040] In addition to using feedback data during ongoing powertrain operations, feedforward data can be utilized to determine states of operating parameters. During ongoing powertrain operation, a method for predicting for a future time predictive data includes: a predicted change in the operator torque request, a predicted operator torque request for the future time, a predicted total torque request for the future time, a predicted acceleration of the output member 64 at the future time, a predicted change in an angular speed of the output member 64, and a predicted angular speed of the output member 64 at the future time.<br>
[0041] The future time is an instant in time after a predetermined elapsed time interval from the present instant in time. Use of the terms predicted, predicting, and predict refer to the future time after the predetermined elapsed time interval. As stated above, loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 ms during ongoing operation of the powertrain. The predetermined elapsed time interval may be based upon loop cycles or multiples of the loop cycles in the HCP 5. Additionally, the strategic optimization control scheme 310, the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320, and the tactical control scheme 330 may have different predetermined elapsed time intervals for execution. [0042] The predicted change in the operator torque request over a first predetermined elapsed time interval can be determined based upon the operator torque request, a time-based derivative of the operator torque request,<br><br>
and the first predetermined elapsed time interval. As FIG. 4 depicts, the operator torque request can be calculated by summing normalized operator inputs to a brake pedal 112 and accelerator pedal 113 positions (400). One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, in addition to pedals, the operator torque request may be determined from multiple input devices including joysticks, throttles, and levers. Additionally, conventional or adaptive cruise control systems may be incorporated into the powertrain system to supplant the operator torque request. The cruise control supplies the operator torque request based upon an operator desired motor vehicle speed and, in the case of an adaptive system, speeds of various vehicles within a predetermined proximity to the motor vehicle. A torque request determined by the cruise control system can then be utilized by the method in place of the operator torque request.<br>
[0043] Once the operator torque request is determined, a time-based derivative of the operator torque request can then be determined (402). Preferably, the operator torque request derivative is determined algorithmically within one of the control modules, however other methods can include using an output from a resistor-capacitor circuit that is signally connected to the brake pedal 112 and accelerator pedal 113. One preferred method comprises using a high pass filter e.g., a lead filter algorithmically within the HCP 5. The high pass filter approximates the operator torque request derivative by reducing signal noise and attenuating noise amplification resulting in a more continuous derivative signal than a pure derivative calculation.<br><br>
[0044] The operator torque request derivative is multiplied by the first predetermined elapsed time interval (404). The product of the operator torque request derivative and the first predetermined elapsed time interval is the predicted change in the operator torque request over the predetermined elapsed time interval to the first future time.<br>
[0045] Once the predicted change in the operator torque request is determined, the predicted operator torque request at the first future time can be determined (406). The predicted operator torque request is based upon the predicted change in torque and the operator torque request. The predicted operator torque request at the first future time is the sum of the predicted change in the operator torque request and the operator torque request. [0046] Once the predicted operator torque request is determined, the predicted total torque request is determined for the first future time (408). The predicted total torque request can be determined based upon the predicted operator torque request and road loads. The calculated road load is preferably the result of a dynamic road load simulator adapted during ongoing powertrain operations and as road conditions change. Road load is an estimate of torque required to overcome road conditions and can comprise aerodynamic friction, rolling resistance, and road grade. The sum of the predicted operator torque request and the road loads is the predicted total torque request at the first future time.<br>
[0047] After the predicted total torque request at the future time is determined, Newton's law of motion can be applied to calculate the predicted angular acceleration ('NoDotPrdct') of the output member 64 at the future time (410). The predicted angular acceleration of the output member 64 is<br><br>
determined by dividing the total predicted torque by an inertia value of the vehicle. The calculated vehicle inertia is preferably the result of a dynamic vehicle inertia simulator adapted during ongoing powertrain operations based upon the motor vehicle acceleration and the motor torques. Alternatively, vehicle inertia may be a predetermined static value.<br>
[0048] After the predicted angular acceleration of the output member 64 is determined at the first future time, a predicted angular speed change of the output member 64 over the first predetermined elapsed time interval may be determined (412). The predicted angular speed change of the output member 64 is the product of the predicted angular acceleration of the output member 64 multiplied by the future time. The predicted angular speed change is the speed change from the present to the first future time. [0049] After the predicted angular speed change is determined, a predicted angular speed ('NoPrdct') of the output member 64 may be determined for the first future time (414). The predicted angular speed of the output member 64 is the sum of the actual measured speed of the output member 64 measured by the transmission output speed sensor 84 at the present time and the predicted angular speed change.<br>
[0050] Multiple future times may be concurrently determined for the different operating parameters and may be based upon different loop cycle timings of the various control modules and experimentally predetermined optimizations. As the predictive data are determined for a plurality of future times, they may be used for determining powertrain operating parameters. Operating parameters may include selecting the preferred operating range states described in Table 1, positioning engine actuators, controlling operation<br><br>
of the engine to a preferred operating point, and controlling the motor torques of the first and second electrical machines 56 and 72. [0051] As FIG. 5 shows, after the predictive data are determined in block 500, they may be used in the strategic optimization control scheme 310, the tactical control scheme 330, and the output and motor torque determination scheme 340. Inputs into the output and motor torque control scheme 340 can include a predicted angular acceleration ('NoDotPrdct'), and predicted angular speed ('NoPrdct') of the output member 64. Inputs into the tactical control scheme 330 can include a predicted angular acceleration ('NoDotPrdctTact'), and predicted angular speed ('NoPrdctTact') of the output member 64. Inputs into the strategic optimization control scheme 310 can include a predicted angular acceleration ('NoDotPrdctStrat'), and predicted angular speed ('NoPrdctStrat') of the output member 64. The predictive data may be determined for a plurality of future times based upon different optimizations in the strategic optimization control scheme 310, the tactical control scheme 330, and the output and motor torque determination scheme 340. [0052] FIG. 6 shows data illustrating both measured angular acceleration and the predicted angular acceleration of output member 64 over a period of time for an exemplary system. As depicted, the predicted angular acceleration enables significantly less data variation than the measured angular acceleration and can result in greater accuracy of torque requests and efficient powertrain performance.<br>
[0053] The same methods as described hereinabove are applicable to engine starts operative in multiple more powertrain systems including powertrain systems with compression ignition, spark-ignition, homogeneous-charge<br><br>
compression-ignition, and spark-ignition direct-injection engines. Another exemplary powertrain system comprises a belt alternator starter system ('BAS') (not shown). In the BAS system, an engine can be shut OFF during stops and restarted for battery recharging and vehicle acceleration. The electrical motor may be used to recharge the battery or to provide torque mechanically through the engine during engine acceleration. In each of these situations an engine start type may be selected based upon the desired operator torque.<br>
