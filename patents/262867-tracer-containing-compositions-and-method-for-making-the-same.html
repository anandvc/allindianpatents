This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/548,085, filed February 26, 2004, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of compression refrigeration and air conditioning. Specifically, the present invention relates to a composition comprising refrigerant and tracer compound(s). Additionally, the present invention relates to a method for the identification of refrigerant gases after leaving the custody of the original manufacturer and the verification of refrigerant authenticity. The aforementioned method provides for the detection of tracer compounds, which in turn, may alert the refrigeration industry to the occurrence of dilution, adulteration, contamination or other unauthorized modification of refrigeration products.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art.<br>
Environmental concerns have led the refrigeration industry to high levels of consciousness around the responsible use of refrigerants. The refrigeration industry, as well as the society at large, benefits when everyone who manufactures, distributes, uses refrigerants, or services refrigeration and air conditioning equipment uses all applicable measures to keep equipment operating at the highest achievable level of energy efficiency. This reduces the amount of energy consumed by the equipment. Higher than necessary energy consumption, as well as leakage of refrigerants, can contribute to unnecessary pollution of our atmosphere and waste of existing resources. This unnecessary waste also comes at a cost to the consumer for replacement of leaked refrigerant.<br>
In response to environmental concerns, manufacturers of refrigerants have developed new refrigerant products that allow higher levels of energy efficiency when used in properly designed equipment. The new generation HFC refrigerants have less impact on the<br>
environment than older generation chlorinated refrigerants in the event<br>
that they inadvertently leak into the atmosphere. The HFC refrigerants<br>
have zero ozone depletion potential, and in general have less tropospheric<br>
climate, change potential than the refrigerants they replace. In addition,<br>
industry practices now mandate the elimination of leaks from most types of<br>
operating equipment, and require that refrigerant gas be recovered from<br>
equipment when that equipment is taken out of service or is opened to<br>
allow service work to be performed.<br>
While the new high efficiency refrigerants and new responsible use<br>
policies are benefiting the environment, the benefit is not as great as it<br>
could be. In some instances, the recovered refrigerant gases are not<br>
properly reclaimed or recycled. The recovered refrigerant may be reinstalled<br>
back into other pieces of equipment without being properly<br>
reclaimed and cleaned to remove any harmful or energy efficiency<br>
reducing impurities which may have been introduced in handling or as a<br>
result of poorly performing or damaged equipment. The equipment into<br>
which this refrigerant is introduced will then not operate at peak efficiency,<br>
and will consume more energy than necessary.<br>
In addition, used refrigerant can be blended with virgin refrigerant,<br>
which generally results in a non-standard refrigerant gas composition.<br>
Similarly, used refrigerant can be re-packaged and sold as virgin<br>
refrigerant, without certification of purity and quality. These practices may<br>
result in increased atmospheric pollution and increased energy use, and<br>
places expensive refrigeration hardware at risk of being damaged.<br>
In addition to negative environmental and equipment impact, there<br>
are economic losses to the refrigerant manufacturers and distributors.<br>
Refrigerant manufacturers make significant investments into the<br>
development of the quality new refrigerants products. Refrigerant<br>
distributors similarly have invested in equipment for the proper protection<br>
of refrigerants from contamination during packaging, storage, and<br>
distribution of refrigerants When refrigerants are diluted or blended with<br>
recovered refrigerants, and sold as virgin refrigerant, manufacturers and<br>
distributors do not receive the benefit of their investment.<br>
Fof the foregoing reasons, there has been a need for the ability to<br>
positively determine when a refrigerant composition is diluted or altered in<br>
any way, in a manner that does not compromise performance or the<br>
product properties to any measurable extent.<br>
PCT/US2005/005595<br>
The present invention addresses this need by providing a highly<br>
secure way to label virgin refrigerant product.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a tracer-containing composition,<br>
said composition comprising a refrigeration/heating fluid and at least one<br>
tracer compound, said tracer compound being present and analytically<br>
detectable and being selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrofluqrocarbons, deuterated hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,<br>
fluoroethers, brominated compounds, iodated compounds, alcohols,<br>
aldehydes and ketones, nitrous oxide and combinations thereof.<br>
Additionally, the present invention relates to a composition as stated<br>
above wherein at least one of said tracer compound is present as a single<br>
pre-determined isomer.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using the<br>
present inventive tracer-containing compositions, said method comprising<br>
combining said tracer compound with said refrigeration/heating fluid to<br>
make a tracer-containing refrigerant composition, and detecting the<br>
presence of said tracer compound in said tracer-containing refrigerant<br>
composition. Said method may comprise detecting the occurrence of<br>
dilution, adulteration or contamination of said composition.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to use of the tracer-containing<br>
composition in a method for producing refrigeration comprising<br>
evaporating said composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled and<br>
thereafter condensing said composition. And the present invention<br>
additionally relates to a method of using the tracer-containing refrigerant<br>
composition for producing heat comprising condensing said composition in<br>
the vicinity of a body to be heated and thereafter evaporating said<br>
composition.<br>

azeotrope-like fluorocarbon refrigerant compositions, such as, HCFC-<br>
22/HFC-152a/HCFC-124 (known by the ASHRAE designations, R-401A,<br>
R-401B, and R-401C), HFC-125/HFC-143a/HFC-134a (known by the<br>
ASHRAE designation, R-404A), HFC-32/HFC-125/HFC-134a (known by<br>
ASHRAE designations, R-407A, R-407B, and R-407C), HCFC-22/HFC-<br>
143a/HFC-125 (known by the ASHRAE designation, R-408A), HCFC-<br>
22/HCFC-124/HCFC-142b (known by the ASHRAE designation: R-409A),<br>
HFC-32/HFC-125 (R-410A), and HFC-125/HFC-143a (known by the<br>
ASHRAE designation: R-507).<br>
The fluorocarbon refrigerants of the present invention may<br>
optionally further comprise up to 10 weight percent of dimethyl ether, or at<br>
least one Ca to C5 hydrocarbon, e.g., propane, propylene, cyclopropane,<br>
n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane, cyclopentane and neopentane (2,2-<br>
dimethylpropane). Examples of fluorocarbons containing such C3 to C5<br>
hydrocarbons are azeotrope-like compositions of HCFC-22/HFC-<br>
125/propane (known by the ASHRAE designation, R-402A and R-402B),<br>
HCFC-22/octafluoropropane/propane (known by the ASHRAE<br>
designation, R-403A and R-403B), octafluoropropane/HCFC-<br>
134a/isobutane (known by the ASHRAE designation, R-413A), HCFC-<br>
22/HCFC-124/HCFC-142b/isobutane (known by the ASHRAE<br>
designation,R-414A and R-414B), HFC-134a/HCFC-124/n-butane (known<br>
by the ASHRAE designation, R-416A), HFC-125/HFC-134a/n-butane<br>
(known by the ASHRAE designation, R-417A), HFC-125/HFC-<br>
134a/dimethyl ether (known by the ASHRAE designation, R-419A), and<br>
HFC-125/HFC-134a/isobutane (known by ASHRAE designation, R-422A).<br>
The tracer compound of the present invention is selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydrofluorocarbon, deuterated hydrocarbon or<br>
hydrofluorocarbon, perfluorocarbon, fluoroether, brominated compound,<br>
iodated compound, alcohol, aldehydes and ketone, nitrous oxide (N2O)<br>
and combinations thereof. While there may be overlap between a defined<br>
chemical compound, which may be a refrigeration/heating fluid, and a<br>
chemical compound that may be defined as a tracer compound, the same<br>
compound may not serve as both elements of a given composition.<br>
Suitable tracer compound candidates are listed in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds listed in Table 1 are available commercially<br>
(from chemical supply houses, such as Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wl) or may be<br>
prepared by processes known in the art.<br>
Single tracer compounds may be used in combination with a<br>
refrigeration/heating fluid in the compositions of the present invention or<br>
multiple tracer compounds may be combined in any proportion to serve as<br>
a tracer blend. The tracer blend may contain multiple tracer compounds<br>
from the same class of compounds or multiple tracer compounds from<br>
different classes of compounds. For example, a tracer blend may contain<br>
2 or more deuterated hydrofluorocarbons, or one deuterated<br>
hydrofluorocarbon in combination with one or more perfluorocarbons.<br>
Additionally, some of the compounds in Table 1 exist as multiple<br>
'isomers, structural or optical. Single isomers or multiple isomers of the<br>
same compound may be used in any proportion to prepare the tracer<br>
compound. Further, single or multiple isomers of a given compound may<br>
be combined in any proportion with any number of other compounds to<br>
serve as a tracer blend.<br>
The tracer-containing refrigerant compositions of the present<br>
invention may be prepared by any convenient method to combine the<br>
desired amount of the individual components. A preferred method is to<br>
weigh the desired component amounts and thereafter combine the<br>
components in an appropriate vessel. Agitation may be used, if desired.<br>
By "analytically detectable" is meant that the tracer or tracer blend<br>
may be detected by any analytical method capable of differentiating the<br>
tracer from the refrigeration/heating fluid or capable of determining the<br>
quantity of tracer present. In the case where a dilution of the tracercontaining<br>
composition may have occurred, the tracer compound may be<br>
present in a lesser quantity than originally added to the<br>
refrigeration/heating fluid. Analytical detection of the lesser quantity would<br>
aid the refrigeration industry. Such detection is capable of alerting the<br>
industry to the occurrence of dilution, adulteration, or contamination.<br>
Additionally, manufacturers, distributors and purchasers would be able to<br>
verify or authenticate the source (ie., supplier) of the refrigerant<br>
composition by comparing any quantity of detected tracer to the quantity<br>
that was intentionally combined with refrigeration/heating fluid by the<br>
source.<br>
Gas chromatography (GC) is one analytical method that may be<br>
used to detect and quantify the tracer or tracer blend in the<br>
refrigeration/heating fluid. Any GC detector may be used that is capable<br>
of detecting and quantifying the tracer compound. Such detectors<br>
include, but are not limited, to flame ionization detector (FID), thermal<br>
conductivity detector (TCD), electron-capture detector (ECD), photo-<br>
ionization detector (PID), infrared detectors (IRD) and mass spectrometer<br>
detectors (usually referred to as GC-MS when combined with a gas<br>
chromatograph). Other analytical methods may be utilized which do not<br>
require the gas chromatographic separation prior to detection. Such<br>
additional analytical methods include but are not limited to nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) or infrared (IR) spectrometry.<br>
When mixtures of this invention are analyzed using gas<br>
chromatography, conditions capable of identifying and quantifying the<br>
tracer in the presence of the refrigeration/heating fluid may be used. The<br>
GC column used for the analysis must be chosen so as to be capable of<br>
separating the tracer compound or components of the tracer blend from<br>
the refrigeration/heating fluid. Both packed and capillary GC columns may<br>
be used. The preferred GC columns are those known to provide<br>
separation of fluorocarbon compounds from each other and classes of<br>
candidate tracer compounds of the present invention.<br>
The packed GC columns that may be useful in the present<br>
invention are from about 1 meter to about 12 meters in length. Generally,<br>
packed GC columns are constructed of stainless steel. The commercially<br>
available packed GC columns that may be useful in the present invention<br>
include but are not limited to: porous polymer stationary phase, such as<br>
Porapak® Q or Porapak® T; silicone polymer stationary phases, such as<br>
SP®-1000 on Carbopack® B supporter SP®-2100 (methyl silicone) on<br>
Supelcoport® support, perfluorinated polymer stationary phase, Fluorcol®<br>
on Carbopack ® B support; and polyethylene glycol stationary phases,<br>
such as Carbowax® on Carbopack® C support. For those packed GC<br>
columns that are packed with a polymer coated support, the polymer<br>
loading may range from about 0.1 % to about 10%. Packed GC columns<br>
listed here are available from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA).<br>
Capillary GC columns which are found useful in the present<br>
invention are available commercially. Capillary columns may vary in<br>
length from about 10 meters to about 105 meters, but may also be longer<br>
if two or more columns are joined together (e.g. 120 meters by joining two<br>
60 meter capillary GC columns). The capillary GC columns that may be of<br>
use in the present invention are generally constructed of fused silica<br>
tubing and vary in inner diameter (ID) from about 0.1 millimeter to about<br>
0.53 millimeter. The stationary phase for the capillary GC columns is<br>
coated on the interior surface of the column and may vary in thickness<br>
from about 0.1 micrometer to about 5 micrometers. The stationary phases<br>
that may be of use in the present invention, include but are not limited to<br>
the commercially available liquid polymer phases: RTX®-1 ((Crossbond®<br>
100% dimethyl polysiloxane), RTX®-200 (Crossbond® trifluoropropylmethyl<br>
polysiloxane), RTX®-1301 (Crossbond® 6% cyanopropylphenyl/94%<br>
dimethyl polysiloxane), RTX®-1701 (Crossbond® 14%<br>
cyanopropylphenyl/86% dimethyl polysiloxane) from Restek Corporation<br>
(Bellefonte, PA). Porous layer open tubular (PLOT) capillary columns may<br>
also be useful in the present invention. Such PLOT capillary GC columns<br>
include, but are not limited to, the CP-PoraPLOT® Q (100% styrene<br>
divinylbenzene) column from Varian Ohrompack (Middelburg, The<br>
Netherlands).<br>
Temperature and pressure conditions for the GC analysis will vary<br>
depending upon the refrigeration/heating fluid and the tracer being used in<br>
the composition. Cryogenic temperatures (sub-ambient, requiring liquid<br>
nitrogen, dry ice or liquid carbon dioxide) may be used in order to provide<br>
separation of low boiling components (either refrigeration/heating fluid or<br>
tracer compound(s)), when necessary.<br>
Tracer compounds or blends may be present in concentrations that<br>
are detectable by whichever analytical method is chosen. Additionally, the<br>
tracer concentration must be chosen such that the quantity of tracer or<br>
tracer blend does not interfere with the performance of the<br>
refrigeration/heating fluid. The tracer compound or tracer blend may be<br>
present at a total concentration of about 50 parts per million by weight<br>
(ppm) to about 1000 ppm. Preferably, the tracer compound or tracer<br>
blend is present at a total concentration of about 50 ppm to about 500 ppm<br>
and most preferably, the tracer compound or tracer blend is present at a<br>
total concentration of about 100 ppm to about 300 ppm.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using the<br>
present inventive tracer-containing refrigerant compositions, said method<br>
comprising combining said tracer compound with said refrigeration/heating<br>
fluid to make a tracer-containing refrigerant composition, and detecting the<br>
presence of said tracer compound in said tracer-containing refrigerant<br>
composition. The present method is useful to (i) determine the occurrence<br>
of dilution, adulteration or contamination or (ii) verify the source of the<br>
refrigerant composition of said composition.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of using the<br>
present inventive tracer-containing refrigerant composition, said method<br>
comprising: (i) producing refrigeration by evaporating the tracercontaining<br>
refrigerant composition in the vicinity of a body to be cooled<br>
and thereafter condensing said composition; or (ii).producing heat by<br>
condensing the tracer-containing refrigerant composition in the vicinity of<br>
the body to be heated and thereafter evaporating said composition.<br>
Vapor-compression refrigeration systems include an evaporator, a<br>
compressor, a condenser, a liquid storage receiver and an expansion<br>
device. A vapor-compression cycle re-uses refrigerant in multiple steps<br>
producing a cooling effect in one step and a heating effect in a different<br>
step. The cycle can be described simply as follows. Liquid refrigerant<br>
enters an evaporator through an expansion device, and the liquid<br>
refrigerant boils in the evaporator at a low temperature to form a gas and<br>
produce cooling. The low-pressure gas enters a compressor where the<br>
gas is compressed to raise its pressure and temperature. The highpressure<br>
gaseous refrigerant then enters the condenser in which the<br>
refrigerant condenses and discharges its heat to the environment. The<br>
refrigerant returns to the expansion device through which the liquid<br>
expands from the high-pressure level in the condenser to the low-pressure<br>
level in the evaporator, thus repeating the cycle.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Tracer-containing refrigerant compositions of the present invention<br>
were prepared and then analyzed using several different GC columns<br>
under differing conditions of analysis. The retention times for the<br>
refrigeration/heating fluid and tracer compounds were determined and are<br>
given for each example. It should be noted that exact retention times<br>
determined on a specific gas chromatograph and with a specific GC<br>
column will vary slightly from retention times determined from a different<br>
instrument and column.<br>
All samples were analyzed on Agilent 6890 Gas Chromatographs<br>
and the data collected and processed by Agilent Chemstation® software,<br>
both available from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA).<br>
