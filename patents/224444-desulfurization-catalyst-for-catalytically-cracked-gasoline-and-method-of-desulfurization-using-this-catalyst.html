				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
 The present invention relates to a desulfurization catalyst for catalytically<br>
cracked gasoline and a method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline using the<br>
same. The desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline refers to a<br>
catalyst for removing sulfur contained in generated catalytically cracked gasoline, when<br>
heavy hydrocarbon oil or vacuum gas oil is catalytically cracked with a fluidized catalytic<br>
cracking device (abbreviated as an FCC device hereinafter).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
 Catalytically cracked gasoline obtained by fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy<br>
hydrocarbon oil or vacuum gas oil contains a sulfur compound, and a reduction of such<br>
sulfur contained in catalytically cracked gasoline has been demanded these days,<br>
because a catalyst for removing NOx contained in car exhaust emission to deal with the<br>
environmental problems such as air pollution suffers a rapid deterioration in its activity<br>
when the catalyst is poisoned by the sulfur. In Japan, the quantity of sulfur content in<br>
gasoline is regulated to be 50 ppm or less from 2005, and there have been proposed<br>
various desulfurization methods of removing sulfur contained in catalytically cracked<br>
gasoline using a catalyst.<br>
[0003]<br><br>
 For instance, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. HEI 6-277519<br>
describes that catalytic cracking catalyst with a compound of Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, In, Sn,<br>
Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, B, Al (other than AI2O3) or Ga supported on alumina therein can be used<br>
for obtaining a low-sulfur containing gasoline fraction. In a method of employing the<br>
catalyst described above, however, the performance of desulfurization has not yet been<br>
sufficient.<br>
[0004]<br>
 Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-27065 discloses a method of<br>
desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline in which, in catalytically cracking of material<br>
oil using a fluidized catalytic cracking device or a heavy oil fluidized catalytic cracking<br>
device, a catalytic cracking desulfurization catalyst containing a catalyst with at least<br>
one type of metal selected from vanadium, zinc, nickel, iron and cobalt uniformly<br>
supported in an inorganic porous material therein; and also describes that vanadium or<br>
zinc is preferably used in view of desulfurization of a generated gasoline fraction in the<br>
method.<br>
 The catalytic cracking desulfurization catalyst containing a catalyst with<br>
vanadium supported thereon has the problem that, though the catalyst has an effect of<br>
removing a sulfur content in a gasoline fraction, an generated amount of hydrogen and<br>
coke is increased.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENION<br>
[0005]<br>
 An object of the present invention is to solve the problems described above and<br>
to provide, in fluidized catalytic cracking for heavy hydrocarbon oil and vacuum gas oil, a<br>
desulfurization catalyst showing a high-desulfurization performance of removing a sulfur<br><br>
content in a gasoline fraction, with generation of hydrogen and coke being suppressed,<br>
and a method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline using the desulfurization<br>
catalyst.<br>
[0006]<br>
 The present inventors pursued intensive studies to achieve the object<br>
described above, thereby found that a catalyst with antimony and vanadium supported<br>
therein has a high performance of desulfurizing a gasoline fraction with generation of<br>
hydrogen and coke being suppressed therein, which has resulted in the completion of<br>
the present invention.<br>
 Namely, the present invention provides a desulfurization catalyst for<br>
catalytically cracked gasoline comprising a porous inorganic oxide matrix containing<br>
vanadium and antimony.<br>
 Preferably the content of the vanadium as V2O5 is in a range from 0.3 to 3 wt%<br>
(catalyst standard) and that of the antimony as Sb2O3 is in a range from 0.3 to 5 wt%<br>
(catalyst standard).<br>
 Preferably the porous inorganic oxide matrix contains crystalline aluminosilicate<br>
zeolite.<br>
 The method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention implements a catalytic cracking reaction as well as a desulfurization<br>
reaction by contacting a mixed catalyst with the desulfurization catalyst for catalytically<br>
cracked gasoline and a hydrocarbon catalytic cracking catalyst mixed in the weight ratio<br>
of 5/95 to 50/50, with heavy hydrocarbon oil and/or vacuum gas oil under catalytic<br>
cracking condition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
[0007]<br>
 The desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention comprises a porous inorganic oxide matrix containing vanadium and<br>
antimony.<br>
 As the porous inorganic oxide matrix according to the present invention, an<br>
inorganic oxide matrix used for a catalyst composition for fluidiized catalytic cracking<br>
(referred to as a FCC catalyst hereinafter) is generally available, and may include, for<br>
instance, refractory oxide such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia,<br>
alumina-boria, titania, zirconia, silica-zirconia, calcium silicate and calcium aluminate;<br>
clay material such as kaolin, bentonite and halloysite. In addition, a metal scavenger<br>
such as alumina powder can be used together according to the necessity. In particular,<br>
an inorganic oxide matrix comprising silica, kaolin, porous silica xerogel and alumina is<br>
preferable because a pore volume thereof is in a range as large as from 0.20 to 0.70<br>
ml/g.<br>
 The porous inorganic oxide matrix described above is manufactured in the same<br>
method as that of manufacturing an ordinary FCC catalyst composition. In the method,<br>
for instance, inorganic oxide matrix precursors containing silica sol, kaolin, hydrated fine<br>
powder silica and alumina hydrate are spraydried, and the obtained spherical<br>
microparticles are washed, dried and calcinated. The spherical microparticles<br>
preferably have an average particle diameter thereof in a range from 40 to 80 fl m.<br>
[0008]<br>
 In the desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention, the porous inorganic oxide matrix described above contains vanadium<br>
and antimony. The content of vanadium as V2O5 is preferably in a range from 0.3 to 3<br>
wt% by the catalyst standard. When the content is less than 0.3 wt%, the<br><br>
desulfurization performance of removing a sulfur content in a gasoline fraction may<br>
sometimes degrade in fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbon oil or vacuum<br>
gas oil, while in turn, when the content is more than 3 wt%, though desulfurization<br>
performance of removing a sulfur content in a gasoline fraction improves, yield of a<br>
gasoline fraction is likely to drop. The content of the vanadium is more preferably in a<br>
range from 0.5 to 2 wt%.<br>
 The content of antimony as Sb2O3 is preferably in a range from 0.3 to 5 wt% by<br>
the catalyst standard. When the content is less than 0.3 wt%, the effect of suppressing<br>
generation of hydrogen and coke may be reduced, resulting in a drop in yield of a<br>
gasoline fraction. While in turn, when the content is more than 5 wt%, the conversion<br>
rate of heavy hydrocarbon oil and vacuum gas oil in the fluidized catalytic cracking may<br>
drop. The content of the antimony as Sb2O3 is more preferably in a range from 0.5 to 4<br>
wt%. Further, the vanadium and antimony described above may have V/Sb (atomic<br>
ratio) in a range from 0.5 to 1.5, and especially preferably in a range from 0.8 to 1.2 from<br>
an aspect of desulfurization performance of a gasoline fraction.<br>
[0009]<br>
 In the desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention, the porous inorganic oxide matrix described above preferably contains<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. As the crystalline aiuminosilicate zeolite, that used<br>
for a catalyst for ordinary catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon is available, and may include,<br>
for instance, zeolite Y, ultrastable zeolite Y (USY), zeolite X, mordenite, ? -zeolite, and<br>
zeolite ZSM such as ZSM-5. The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite is used by<br>
ion-exchanging with at least one type of cation selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, ammonium and polyvalent metal, as in the case of an ordinary catalytic<br>
cracking catalyst.<br><br>
 The content of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite described above is<br>
available in the amount used in a catalyst for ordinary catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon,<br>
and is preferably in a range from 5 to 50 wt% by the catalyst standard.<br>
 A catalyst with the porous inorganic oxide matrix described above containing<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite is specifically, for instance, a catalyst for ordinary<br>
catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon containing crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite.<br>
[0010]<br>
 The desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention is prepared by making the porous inorganic oxide matrix described<br>
above support a prespecified amount of vanadium and antimony. For instance, a porous<br>
inorganic oxide matrix is impregnated with an aqueous solution with antimony chloride<br>
dissolved in a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, and the resultant solution is dried and<br>
calcined to support antimony, and is further impregnated with an aqueous solution with<br>
ammonium metavanadate dissolved therein, dried and calcined to thereby prepare the<br>
desulfurization catalyst for catalytic cracking gasoline.<br>
[0011]<br>
 The desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention is prepared by making a fluidized catalytic cracking equilibrium catalyst<br>
(FCC equilibrium catalyst) used in a catalytic cracking reaction of heavy hydrocarbon oil<br>
with an FCC device and extracted from a catalyst regeneration tower support a<br>
prespecified amount of antimony. Generally, about 50 to 10000 ppm of vanadium as<br>
V2O5 and about 10 to 5000 ppm of nickel as NiO deposit in the fluidized catalytic<br>
cracking equilibrium catalyst, so that the supporting of antimony on the fluidized<br>
catalytic cracking equilibrium catalyst enables to obtain a desulfurization catalyst for<br>
catalytically cracked gasoline according to the present invention. It is to be noted that,<br><br>
when the amount of vanadium depositing on the fluidized catalytic cracking equilibrium<br>
catalyst is small, it is preferable to make a prespecified amount of vanadium support on<br>
the catalyst together with antimony.<br>
[0012]<br>
 Next a method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention is described below.<br>
 The method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention implements a catalytic cracking reaction as well as a desulfurization<br>
reaction by contacting a mixed catalyst of the desulfurization catalyst for catalytically<br>
cracked gasoline described above and an FCC catalyst, with heavy hydrocarbon oil<br>
and/or vacuum gas oil under catalytic cracking condition.<br>
[0013]<br>
 As FCC catalyst, any commercially available FCC catalyst can be used, and, in<br>
particular, a FCC catalyst containing a faujasite type of zeolite is suitably used because<br>
of its high cracking activity. The FCC catalyst containing a faujasite type of zeolite<br>
may include, for instance, a catalyst having a faujasite type of zeolite (USY) with an Si<br>
O2/AI2O3 molar ratio of 5 to 6 in a range from 10 to 50 wt%, silica as a bonding agent in a<br>
range from 15 to 25 wt%, active alumina in a range from 0 to 20 wt%, a metal scavenger<br>
in a range from 0 to 10 wt%, and kaolin in a range from 25 to 65 wt%. As the catalyst<br>
described above, ACZ, DCT, STW, BLC, HMR (each of which is a trademark or a<br>
registered trademark of FCC catalyst manufactured by Catalysts &amp; Chemicals Industries<br>
Co., Ltd.) and the like are suitably used.<br>
 Further, as the FCC catalyst according to the present invention, an equilibrium<br>
catalyst of the FCC catalyst described above employed in the catalytic cracking<br>
reaction of hydrocarbon in an FCC device is applicable.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
 The mixed catalyst described above has a mixing ratio of a desulfurization<br>
catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline and the FCC catalyst in a range from 5/95 to<br>
50/50 by weight ratio. When the mixing ratio of a desulfurization catalyst for<br>
catalytically cracked gasoline is smaller than 5/95, the amount of the desulfurization<br>
catalyst is too small to sufficiently remove a sulfur content in a gasoline fraction, while<br>
in turn, when the mixing ratio of a desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked<br>
gasoline is larger than 50/50, the cracking activity is deteriorated to lower an yield of<br>
gasoline.<br>
 The mixing ratio of a desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline<br>
and an FCC catalyst described above is preferably in a range from 10/90 to 30/70 by<br>
weight ratio.<br>
[0015]<br>
 A method of desulfurizing catalytically cracked gasoline implements, in an FCC<br>
device, a catalytic cracking reaction as well as a desulfurization reaction by contacting<br>
the mixed catalyst described above with heavy hydrocarbon oil and/or vacuum gas oil<br>
under catalytic cracking condition. The catalytic cracking condition may be that based<br>
on the conventional technology in the art, and may include, for instance, a catalytic<br>
cracking temperature in a range from about 400 to 600 °C and a regeneration<br>
temperature in a range from about 500 to 800°C.<br>
[0016]<br>
 The desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline according to the<br>
present invention can reduce, when used for catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbon oil<br>
and/or vacuum gas oil by mixing with a hydrocarbon catalytic cracking catalyst in an<br>
FCC device, the sulfur concentration in a gasoline fraction without lowering the cracking<br><br>
activity thereof. It is presumed that this is because antimony has a high hydrocracking<br>
performance for a sulfur compound and an effect of preventing generation of hydrogen<br>
due to the suppression of a dehydrogenation reaction, and further, antimony and<br>
vanadium generate a compound such as SbVO4, Sb2VO5, and V0.1Sb0.9O4 to suppress the<br>
dehydrogenation reaction caused by vanadium, resulting in less hydrogen to be<br>
generated.<br>

aqueous solution of antimony trichloride with 15.6 g of antimony trichloride (KANTO<br>
KAGAKU K.K., reagent of the special grade) dissolved in 32 g of a 17.5 wt% diluted<br>
hydrochloric acid aqueous solution was added to the suspension. As the suspension<br>
had pH at 1.8, 60 g of a 10 wt% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the<br>
suspension to adjust the pH to 3.0. and was agitated for 20 minutes.<br>
 Then 174 g of a 10 wt% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the<br>
suspension to neutralize the same to pH 7.0. The neutralized suspension was<br>
solid-liquid separated with a Buchner funnel, and 2.5 liter of deionized water at 60°C<br>
was sprinkled on the residual solid content for washing. The aforementioned solid<br>
content was suspended again in warm water at 60°C, and 24 g of ammonium sulfate was<br>
added thereto and agitated, the resultant solution was solid-liquid separated with a<br>
Buchner funnel to remove an Na2O content, was dried at 135°C for 12 hours, and was<br>
calcinated at 600°C for 2 hours to prepare a desulfurization catalyst for catalytically<br>
cracked gasoline ( ? ). Properties of the desulfurization catalyst for catalytically<br>
cracked gasoline (?) is shown in Table 2.<br>
[0025]<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
 495 g (on dry basis) of the USY containing porous inorganic oxide matrix (A)<br>
according to Reference Example 1 was impregnated with an aqueous solution with 6.3 g<br>
of ammonium metavanadate dissolved in an amine aqueous solution, was then dried at<br>
135 °C for 12 hours, and was calcinated at 600 °C for 2 hours to prepare a<br>
desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline ( ? ). Properties of the<br>
desulfurization catalyst for catalytically cracked gasoline (?) is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
[0027]<br>
Evaluation Test 1<br>
 Desulfurization catalysts for catalytically cracked gasoline (?) to (?) according<br>
to Examples 1 to 4 and desulfurization catalysts for catalytically cracked gasoline (?)<br>
and (?) according to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were 100% steam treated at 750°C<br>
for 13 hours. 222 g of each of the pretreated desulfurization catalysts is mixed with<br>
2.00 kg of the FCC equilibrium catalyst having properties as shown in Table 3, and each<br>
of the mixed catalysts having the mixing weight ratio of 10/90 was subjected to an<br>
evaluation test. 100% of the FCC equilibrium catalyst was employed as reference for<br>
the evaluation test.<br>
 The evaluation test for the mixed catalysts was made using a continuous<br>
reaction pilot device capable of regenerating each of the catalysts. The device is a<br>
circulation type of fluidized bed in which a catalyst is subjected to an alternate cycle of<br>
reaction and regeneration thereof while the catalyst is circulating in the device, and is in<br>
imitation of an FCC device used on a commercial scale.<br>
The Reaction condition of the evaluation test is as follows;<br><br>
Material oil:	Desulfurized vacuum gas oil (60%) + vacuum gas oil (40%)<br>
Reaction temperature:	500°C<br>
Regeneration temperature:	67O°C<br>
Ratio of catalyst/material oil: 5 g/g and 7 g/g<br>
Material oil feed rate:	10g/min<br>
 It is to be noted that analysis of generated gas and generated oil was made<br>
using gas chromatography, and the generated oil obtained in a range from C5 to the<br>
boiling point of 204°C was taken as the gasoline fraction. The generated oil was<br>
fractionated to gasoline and cycle oil with the rotary band (theoretical plate number: 45<br>
plates, manufactured by TOUKA SEIKI K.K.) method, and was analyzed for a sulfur<br>
concentration in the gasoline fraction with the coulometric titration method (ASTM<br>
D-3120).<br>
 The result of the evaluation test is shown in terms of an yield of each product<br>
having a conversion rate at a constant value of 73.0 wt% and a sulfur concentration in<br>
the gasoline fraction. The result of the evaluation test is shown in Table 4.<br>
 As seen in Table 4, catalysts employing the desulfurization catalysts for<br>
catalytically cracked gasoline according to the present invention have a lower sulfur<br>
concentration in the gasoline fraction, and have less amount of hydrogen and coke, as<br>
compared to the equilibrium catalyst only.<br><br><br>
*1) LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) represents propane + propylene + n-butane<br>
+ i-butane + butylene<br><br>
*2) Gasoline is a product fractionated in a range from C5 to the boiling point of 204°C.<br>
*3) LCO (light cycle oil) is a product fractionated in a range from the boiling point of<br>
 204°C to 343°C.<br>
*4) HCO (heavy cycle oil) is a product fractionated in a range over the boiling point<br>
 of 343°C.<br>
?5) C1: metane, C2: ethane, C2": ethylene<br><br>
