"AN AXIAL FLOW WIND-TURBINE OPERATED POWER GENERATION DEVICE"<br>
PARTHA SARATHI BURMAN, an Indian National, residing at a/102 Sangam Co-Operative Housing Society, Suchidham, Film City Road, Malad (East), Mumbai 400 097 .<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an axial flow wind-turbine operated device to generate electric power<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Harnessing wind energy is an old practice in the world and is gaining importance in recent times due to increasing cost and eventual depletion of fossil fuels. Wind energy has the advantage of being an inexhaustible source of energy. Hundreds of devices have been contrived to harness wind energy; however, few have survived the test of general commercial application.<br>
Machines to harness wind energy and convert wind energy to electric power which form prior art suffer from several disadvantages.<br>
Prior art machines are typically large in size and heavy and for producing 25 KW of energy, prior art machines are large and in order to work them a huge amount of space is required. Due to their large size these machines are an eyesore and are not appealing to the eye or practicable to use in residential areas.<br>
Conventional machines like windmills need to be placed on the top of tall towers or mounds and at a place where there is no obstruction to the flow of wind like man made structures,<br><br>
trees, etc. and where the velocity of wind is sufficiently high. Conventional machines have been installed in wide open sparsely habited areas. Conventional machines are not suitable for use on top of buildings, etc. in cities and towns as well.<br>
Prior art machines require regular maintenance and repair due to changing weather conditions which is cumbersome and expensive.<br>
Prior art machines can also be dangerous in the case of accidents occurring due to breakage of parts, storms, etc. . Wildlife and birds may also be injured due to the large blades of the machine. Furthermore, prior art machines may shut down during storms, etc. which would cause a problem in case the machines are used to generate power for use for a particular building or locality.<br>
Noise pollution created by prior art machines is another problem as it is hazardous to human health and use of machines which result in noise pollution is objectionable in residential neighborhoods.<br>
Vertical axis machines have problems of mechanical fatigue or the presence of natural resonance frequencies. Furthermore vertical axis machines require motorization in order to overcome high breakaway torque.<br>
What is needed is a compact power generation device which is independent of varying wind conditions, is easy to maintain and<br><br>
which requires a relatively low speed of wind in order to obtain a constant power output.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow wind-turbine operated power generation device which removes the problems associated with prior art and provides for a relatively small, compact, light weight machine which does not require very high wind velocity to function optimally. The present invention has a constant output of electricity since it functions on an average wind velocity i.e. from 5m/s to 8 m/s.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a wind-turbine operated electrical generator device which is not susceptible to dangerous accidents, is rugged and works during adverse climatic conditions, is unaffected by changing weather conditions, is easy to maintain (it only requires monthly cleaning of the turbine), does not produce excessive noise pollution and may be attached to the top of any structure or building, etc.<br>
This device is extremely compact. For example, 100 KW of electrical energy may be produced using an invention where the diameter of the mouth of the wind channeling body is around 3.33 feet and the length of the device is around 4 to 5 feet. Thus, the space requirement is only approximately 4 ' by 3.33'<br><br>
and 6' height. In devices/machines of prior art a huge amount of space is required for producing the same amount of energy.<br>
Since the device is an enclosed one due to the presence of the Wind Channeling Body, the device is not susceptible to dangerous accidents which prior art machines are subject to.<br>
Very little maintenance is required in the device. The equipment will work efficiently if proper cleaning of the wind channeling body is carried out periodically and if the moving parts are greased and oiled.<br>
The present invention is an axial flow wind-turbine operated power generation device which is comprised of the following parts:<br>
(a)	A wind channeling body(l), the inner diameter of which is broad at the side from which wind enters, narrows towards the middle and is broad towards the side from which wind exits. The Wind channeling Body(l) may have an Inspection Window(18) to facilitate maintenance of the device. The inner side of the wind channeling body may have a mirror finish to minimize skin friction of the wind flow.<br>
(b)	A small support cylinder(2) fitted into the narrow central portion of the wind channeling body<br>
(c)	A hub(3) with triangular shaped aerofoil hub vanes(4) along<br>
the length of the tapering end of the hub and curved inlet guide<br>
Vanes (5) along the length of the broader end of the hub such<br><br>
that the wind is directed towards the Rotor blades at a proper angle of attack<br>
(d)	A multi-blade rotor (6) placed next to the broad end of the hub that is supported by bearings and mounted on a rotor shaft(7). The Rotor shaft(7) may be stepped 3 times in order to give a proper fit to the components mounted on the shaft. Alternatively the rotor used may be a multi-stage rotor to increase the efficiency of the equipment.<br>
(e)	A Bearing Housing(9) to house the bearings and allow for lubrication of the bearings. The bearings used may be one row roller bearing and one deep groove ball bearing.<br>
(f)	Oil seals(17) placed in the bearing housing(9) to prevent leakage of oil from the housing<br>
(g)	A coupling(9) which connects the rotor(6) to the<br>
alternator(11) through the Rotor shaft(7) and alternator<br>
shaft(10)<br>
(h) A large support cylinder (13) which is fitted into the broad end of the wind channeling body from which wind exits<br>
(i) An alternator housing (12) which houses the alternator(11) and which is fitted in the large support cylinder (13) .  The output power of the alternator(11) may be connected through a battery bank to the ultimate destination.<br>
(j) An Outer Cover (14) attached to the Wind Channeling Body to protect the Wind Channeling Body from external damage and to house various components. Temperature control means comprising<br><br>
of heating coils and a thermostat may be embedded on the surface of the wind channeling body to maintain an appropriate temperature inside the wind channeling body.<br>
(k) A velocity and direction sensor (15) fixed on top of the cover of the wind channeling body(l) and electrically connected to a servo motor to sense the velocity and direction of the wind (1) Mounting means(16) comprising a turn table assembly (16) rotatably supporting the wind channeling body(1) , said mounting means_directing the entry side of the Wind Channeling Body(l) to take in wind of the desired velocity.<br>
More than one wind-turbine operated power generation device may be kept together and the electrical output of all the devices coupled to yield the sum of the individual outputs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The.present invention arises from the observation that when wind passes from a larger area to a smaller area, the velocity-increases . The hub vanes and inlet guide vanes further enhances the wind velocity and directs the wind to hit the rotor blades at a proper angle of attack. Furthermore when wind passes from a smaller area to a larger area the velocity of the wind decreases and hence temperature reduces cooling the bearing and alternator portion.<br>
The wind-operated turbine may be attached to the roof or top of a building or any large structure. The various components of the invention may be made  from anodized hindoleum{an alloy of<br><br>
aluminium, iron, silicon, magnesium manganese, copper, zinc, titanium and chromium or like material), fibre glass or any suitable material. The preferred material used for this invention is stainless steel. The length of the device and diameter of the mouth of the wind channeling body may vary as per the requirement of power generation. With an increase in dimension the power output may be increased as per the Continuity Equation. A couple of devices may also be kept together and the electrical output may be coupled in parallel to yield the sum of the individual outputs. Thus, power of 100 KW, 250 KW, 1 MW, etc. may be produced depending on the dimensions of the components of the invention.<br>
The wind-turbine operated power generation device is comprised of the following parts:<br>
(A)THE WIND CHANNELING BODY (1):<br>
The shape of the wind channeling body is such that it initially converges and later on diverges as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 so that wind will flow through it with higher velocity. The increase of wind velocity due to the introduction of the Wind Channeling Body follows the continuity equation<br>
A1 x V1 = A2 x V2 where<br>
A1     = inlet Area<br>
A2     = Throat Area<br><br>
V1     = Initial velocity i.e. wind speed<br>
V2    = Velocity at throat as shown in figure.<br>
(B)SMALL SUPPORT CYLINDER (2):<br>
This is a cylinder that is fitted into the inner portion of the Wind Channeling Body at its narrowest portion as shown in FIG 1. and FIG. 2. The Small support cylinder may also be attached by means of screws, fasteners etc. to the Wind Channeling Body. The function of the small support cylinder is to support the hub and inlet guide vanes, to house the rotor, to provide a support to attach the bearing housing and to facilitate easy cleaning of the device.<br>
(C)HUB (3):<br>
In order to further increase the velocity of the wind in the wind channeling body, a bladed hub is introduced in it. The hub is a cone shaped protrusion with a rounded end placed in front of the Rotor. The hub has an aerodynamic design as shown in FIG. 1 and is introduced in Wind Channeling Body to enhance the wind velocity from V2 to V3 through an area A3 where V2 is the throat velocity V3 is the velocity generated in between two consecutive Inlet Guide Vanes and A3 is the area between two consecutive Inlet Guide Vanes. Applying the continuity equation we get a enhanced velocity V3 . The hub is static and may be hollow which would have the effect of reducing the weight of the hub and may<br><br>
be used as a housing for the bearing or support bearing for the rotor shaft.<br>
(D)HUB VANES (4):<br>
Hub Vanes are fixed on the hub and are wedge shaped as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3. Hub Vanes are specially designed aerofoil blades with the leading end having a knife-edge. The knife-edge splits the wind easily and guides the wind through the inlet guide vanes. The vertical end or the trailing end of the Hub Vanes may be joined to the leading end of the inlet guide vanes so as to form a single object. The surfaces of the Hub Vanes have a mirror finish so as to give minimum resistance to the wind when it passes through the Hub Vanes. The Hub Vanes are introduced in the device to increase the wind velocity further so as to get maximum power. In order to obtain an electrical output of 10 KW, 16 Hub Vanes may be used. The number of vanes of the hub may vary depending on the velocity required for producing a particular amount of electrical energy. The number of Hub Vanes may preferably be equal to or 1 1/4 the times the number of rotor blades present in the device.<br>
(E)THE INLET GUIDE VANES (IGV's)  (5):<br>
The inlet guide vanes (IGVs) have an aerofoil design as shown in FIG.l that is thicker at the leading end and narrows down at the trailing end and are fixed around the portion of the hub<br><br>
that is next to the rotor at an appropriate radius that gives a proper angle of attack to the Rotor blades. The IGV's guide and direct the wind so that maximum impact of the wind is at the root and the tip of the Rotor Blades to give maximum torque to the rotor. The number of IGV's is equal to the number of hub blades with the trailing end having a knife-edge. The surfaces of the IGV's have a mirror finish so as to give minimum resistance to the flow of air.<br>
(F)MULTI-BLADE ROTOR (6) AND ROTOR SHAFT(7):<br>
A- number of rotor blades are fixed around the circumference of the rotor. The Rotor should preferably have even number of blades for dynamic balancing of the Rotor and Shaft. The Rotor shaft connects the Rotor to the Coupling and is stepped 3 times in order to give a proper fit to the components mounted on the Shaft i.e. the Rotor, the bearings and couplings. The Rotor is mounted on the part of the shaft with the largest diameter, the bearing housing on the part of the shaft with the medium diameter and the coupling on the part of the shaft with the smallest diameter. Alternatively, the rotor used may be a multistage rotor which consists of two or more rows of blades arranged around the rotor to increase the efficiency of the equipment.<br><br>
(G)BEARING AND BEARING HOUSING(8): The Rotor which is mounted on the Rotor shaft is supported by bearings. The bearings may preferably be cylindrical roller bearings and deep groove ball bearings. The bearings are housed in a Bearing Housing which is supported by the smaller support cylinder. All the moving parts, especially the shaft bearings which has dipped lubrication need to "be properly greased and oiled. The level of oil in the bearing housing also has to be drained out and topped up periodically through the drain pipe of the bearing housing.<br>
(H)COUPLING (9) : The Coupling connects the Rotor through the Rotor shaft to the Alternator through the Alternator shaft. It may preferably be a flanged coupling.<br>
(I)ALTERNATOR SHAFT(10), ALTERNATOR (11) and ALTERNATOR HOUSING<br>
(12) : The Alternator is housed in a housing and is connected to<br>
the  coupling  through  the  Alternator  shaft.  The  preferable<br>
Alternator used is an alternating type frictionless permanent<br>
magnet rotor type alternator.<br>
(J) LARGE SUPPORT CYLINDER (13): This is a cylinder that is fitted into the inner portion of the Wind Channeling Body at its divergent end as shown in FIG 1. and FIG. 2. The large support cylinder may also be attached by means of screws, fasteners etc.<br><br>
to the Wind Channeling Body. The function of the large support cylinder is to house the Alternator.<br>
(K) OUTER COVER OF WIND CHANNELING BODY(14): An Outer Cover may be placed over and attached to the Wind channeling Body in order to protect the Wind Channeling Body from external damage and to house instrumentation parts, electrical wirings, etc. Heating coils and a thermostat may be placed in the cover of the wind channeling body to maintain an appropriate temperature inside the wind channeling body where appropriate.<br>
(K)VELOCITY AND DIRECTION SENSOR(15):<br>
A velocity and direction sensor is fixed on top of the outer cover of the wind channeling body to sense the velocity and direction of the wind and electrically connected to the servo motor. The sensor gives a signal to the servo motor to position the wind channeling body to take in wind of the appropriate velocity.<br>
(L)THE TURN TABLE ASSEMBLY (16)  :<br>
The entire wind channeling body along with its cover is mounted on a turntable with rack and pinion arrangement. The pinion is mounted on a servomotor shaft, which will rotate the turntable and thus position the entry side of the wind channeling body to the direction of the wind at a required intake speed of the<br><br>
device. The turntable assembly will be attached to the top of the building, etc. where the device is placed.<br>
(M)OIL SEAL (17) : Oil seals are present at the ends of the bearing housing in order to prevent the oil from spilling out. The oil seals need to be checked and if found damaged have to be replaced immediately.<br>
(0)INSPECTION WINDOW (18): There may be an Inspection Window at the diverging end of the Wind Channeling body next to the coupling and bearing housing to facilitate maintenance and oiling of the components of the device.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Normal wind velocity in India is from 5 to 8 m/s. When wind of this velocity is passed through the Wind Channeling Body the velocity is enhanced 6 times. As per the Continuity Equation, the aerodynamic shape of the hub increases the velocity of wind 20 times. Further, the hub vanes enhance the velocity of the wind up-to 60 times. The wind is guided through the IGVS to hit the rotor blades at an appropriate angle of attack. The rotor rotates and a rotary motion is given to the rotor shaft which is transmitted to the Alternator shaft through the coupling and which rotates the Alternator to produce power. The electrical energy may be used directly to supply electricity to a building,<br><br>
etc. or through a battery bank for stabilized power supply. The advantage of using a battery bank is to allow for uninterrupted power supply during any repair or maintenance. A velocity and direction sensor is present on the Wind Channeling body. The sensor gives a signal to the servo motor to position the wind channeling body to take in wind of the appropriate velocity. The entire wind channeling body is mounted on a turntable with rack and pinion arrangement. The pinion is mounted on a servomotor shaft, which will rotate the turntable and thus position the entry side of the wind channeling body to the direction of the wind at a required intake speed of the device irrespective of the atmospheric condition. When the wind velocity increases i.e. during cyclonic condition the device will not be affected and will still produce power as in normal wind condition.<br>
Example 1: Use of the device to produce 10 KW of energy:<br>
The device may be used to produce 10 KW of energy. In such a case, the diameter of the mouth of the wind channeling body may be 3.33 feet and length of the device may be from 4 to 5 feet. When wind of velocity of 5 to 8 m/s is passed through the Wind Channeling'Body chamber the velocity is enhanced approximately 6 times to 3 0 to 50 m/s. As per the Continuity Equation, the aerodynamic shape of the hub increases the velocity of wind 2 0 times to 100 to 160 m/s. Further, the hub vanes enhance the velocity of the wind up-to 60 times to 300 to 500 m/s. The wind<br><br>
is guided through the IGVS to hit the rotor blades at an appropriate angle of attack. The rotor rotates at a speed of approximately 4000 to 5000 rpm to produce an electrical power of 10 KW. Thus, a rotary motion is given to the rotor shaft which is transmitted to the Alternator shaft through the coupling and which rotates the Alternator to produce electricity. The wind channeling body is mounted on a turntable. A velocity and direction sensor rotates the wind channeling body with the help of servo motor and rack and pinion arrangement and position to take in wind of the velocity of 5 to 8m/s.<br><br>
