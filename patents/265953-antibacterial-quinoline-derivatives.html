				<td>ANTIBACTERIAL QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline derivatives useful for the treatment of bacterial diseases, including but not limited to diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium and M. marinum.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a serious and potentially fatal infection with a world-wide distribution. Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that more than 8 million people contract TB each year, and 2 million people die from tuberculosis yearly. In the last decade, TB cases have grown 20% worldwide with the highest burden in the most impoverished communities. If these trends continue, TB incidence will increase by 41% in the next twenty years. Fifty years since the introduction of an effective chemotherapy, TB remains after AIDS, the leading infectious cause of adult mortality in the world. Complicating the TB epidemic is the rising tide of multi-drug- resistant strains, and the deadly symbiosis with HIV. People who are HIV-positive and infected with TB are 30 times more likely to develop active TB than people who are HIV-negative and TB is responsible for the death of one out of every three people with HIV/AIDS worldwide<br>
Existing approaches to treatment of tuberculosis all involve the combination of multiple agents. For example, the regimen recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further four months. These drugs are continued for a further seven months in patients infected with HIV. For patients infected with multi-drug resistant strains of M tuberculosis, agents such as ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ciprofoxacin and ofloxacin are added to the combination therapies. There exists no single agent that is effective in the clinical treatment of tuberculosis, nor any combination of agents that offers the possibility of therapy of less than six months' duration.<br>
There is a high medical need for new drugs that improve current treatment by enabling regimens that facilitate patient and provider compliance. Shorter regimens and those that require less supervision are the best way to achieve this. Most of the benefit from<br>
treatment comes in the first 2 months, during the intensive, or bactericidal, phase when four drugs are given together, the bacterial burden is greatly reduced, and patients become noninfectious. The 4- to 6-month continuation, or sterilizing, phase is required to eliminate persisting bacilli arid to minimize the risk of relapse. A potent sterilizing drug that shortens treatment to 2 months or less would be extremely beneficial. Drugs that facilitate compliance by requiring less intensive supervision also are needed. Obviously, a compound that reduces both the total length of treatment and the frequency of drug administration would provide the greatest benefit<br>
Complicating the TB epidemic is the increasing incidence of muhi-drug- resistant strains or MDR-TB. Up to four percent of all cases worldwide are considered MDR-TB - those resistant to the most effective drugs of the four-drug standard, isoniazid and rifampin. MDR-TB is lethal when untreated and cannot be adequately treated through the standard therapy, so treatment requires up to 2 years of "second-line" drugs. These drugs are often toxic, expensive and marginally effective. In the absence of an effective therapy, infectious MDR-TB patients continue to spread the disease, producing new infections with MDR-TB strains. There is a high medical need for a new drug with a new mechanism of action, which is likely to demonstrate activity against drug resistant, in particular MDR strains.<br>
The term "drug resistant" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter is a term well understood by the person skilled in microbiology. A drug resistant Mycobacterium is a Mycobacterium which is no longer susceptible to at least one previously effective drug; which has developed the ability to withstand antibiotic attack by at least one previously effective drug. A drug resistant strain may relay that ability to withstand to its progeny. Said resistance may be due to random genetic mutations in the bacterial cell that alters its sensitivity to a single drug or to different drugs.<br>
MDR tuberculosis is a specific form of drug resistant tuberculosis due to a bacterium resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs), which are at present the two most powerful anti-TB drugs. Thus, whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter "drug resistant5' includes multi drag resistant.<br>
Another factor in the control of the TB epidemic is the problem of latent TB. In spite of decades of tuberculosis (TB) control programs, about 2 billion people are infected by M. tuberculosis, though asymptomatically. About 10% of these individuals are at risk of developing active TB during their lifespan. The global epidemic of TB is fuelled by infection of HIV patients with TB and rise of multi-drug resistant TB strains<br>
(MDR-TB). The reactivation of latent TB is a high risk factor for disease development and accounts for 32% deaths in HIV infected individuals. To control TB epidemic, the need is to discover new drugs mat can kill dormant or latent bacilli. The dormant TB can get reactivated to cause disease by several factors like suppression of host immunity by use of immunosuppressive agents like antibodies against tumor necrosis factor a or interferon-y. In case of HIV positive patients the only prophylactic treatment available for latent TB is two- three months regimens of rifampicin, pyrazinamide.   The efficacy of the treatment regime is still not clear and furthermore the length of the treatments is an important constrain in resource-limited environments. Hence there is a drastic need to identify new drugs, which can act as chemoprophylatic agents for individuals harboring latent TB bacilli.<br>
The tubercle bacilli enter healthy individuals by inhalation; they are phagocytosedby the alveolar macrophages of the lungs. This leads to potent immune response and formation of granulomas, which consist of macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis surrounded by T cells. After a period of 6-8 weeks the host immune response cause death of infected cells by necrosis and accumulation of caseous material with certain extracellular bacilli, surrounded by macrophages, epitheloid cells and layers of lymphoid tissue at the periphery. In case of healthy individuals, most of the mycobacteria are killed in these environments but a small proportion of bacilli still survive and are thought to exist in a non-replicating, hypometabolic state and are tolerant to killing by anti-TB drugs like isoniazid. These bacilli can remain in the altered physiological environments even for individual's lifetime without showing any clinical symptoms of disease. However, in 10% of the cases these latent bacilli may reactivate to cause disease. One of the hypothesis about development of these persistent bacteria is patho-physiological environment in human lesions namely, reduced oxygen tension, nutrient limitation, and acidic pH. These factors have been postulated to render these bacteria phenotypically tolerant to major anti-mycobacterial drugs.<br>
In addition to the management of the TB epidemic, there is the emerging problem of resistance to first-line antibiotic agents. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods of infectivity, which<br>
increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems worldwide.<br>
Therefore, mere is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially mycobacterial infections including drug resistant and latent mycobacterial infections, and also other bacterial infections especially those caused by resistant bacterial strains.<br>
WO 2004/011436, WO2005/070924, WO2005/070430 and WO2005/075428 disclose certain substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307, 223-227.<br>
Other substituted quinolines are disclosed in US 5,965,572 (The United States of America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO 00/34265 to inhibit the growth of bacteria] microorganisms.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, in particular substituted quinoline derivatives, having the property of inhibiting bacterial growth<br>
especially of mycobacteria and therefore useful for the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent disease and including drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains), M. bovis, M, avium andM. marinum. The compounds are also useful in the treatment of other bacterial infections as described below. The compounds according to the present invention are characterized by the presence of a tertiary nitrogen atom in the alpha position in the side chain attached to the 3-position of the quinoline nucleus and thus have a different basic structure to the quinoline derivatives described in the above-mentioned WO 2004/011436 which have an asymmetric carbon atom in this position. The compounds according to the present invention therefore have the advantage that they are able to form fewer enantiomers than the compounds in WO 2004/011436.<br>

Unless otherwise indicated, the above compounds according to Formula (la) or Formula (Ib), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the quaternary amines thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomenc forms thereof, the Af-oxide forms thereof or pro-drugs thereof, are hereinafter referred to as the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (la) and (Ib) are interrelated in that e.g. a compound according to Formula (Ib), with R10 equal to oxo is the tautomeric equivalent of a compound according to Formula (la) with R2 equal to hydroxy (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
In the definition of Het, it is meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles, for instance, pyrrolyl comprises 1H-pyrrolyl and 2H-pyrrolyl.<br>
The aryl or Het listed in the definitions of the substituents of the compounds of formula (Ia) or (Ib) (see for instance R3) as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (Ia) or (Ib) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when Het is imidazolyl, it may be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl and the like.<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
The ptiarraaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to Formula (Ila) or Formula (Ib) are able to form. Said acid addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (la) or Formula (Ib) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulturic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (Ia) or Formula (Ib) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic base addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acidsvfor example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates which the compounds according to Formula (Ia) or Formula (Ib) as well as the<br>
sahs thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula Ia) or (b) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (la) or (b) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted aflcylhalide, arylalkylhalide, alkylcarbonylhalide, Arcarbonylhalide, Hetalkylhalide or Hetcarbonylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Preferably, Het represents a monocyclic heterocycle selected from furanyl or thienyl; or a bicyclic heterocycle selected from benzofuranyl or benzothienyl; each monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycle may optionally be substituted with 1,2 or 3 substituents, each substituent independently selected from the group of halo, alkyl and Ar. Preferably, the quaternisdng agent is alkylhalide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-totoenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Phannaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, triftuoroacetate, acetate, trifiate, sulfate, sulfonate. Preferably, the counterion is iodo. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (Ia) and (Ib), and theirN-oxides, addition salts or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terras cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art,<br>
StBreochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) and (Ib) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the<br>
reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is radicated using relative descriptors [R *,R * ] or [R * 5*], where R * is always specified as the reference center and [R*,R*\ indicates centers with the same chirality and [/Z*,S*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R*, S*]. If "a" and "J3" are used: the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or *'/J", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
When a specific stereoisomeric form is indicated, this means that said form is substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5 %, further preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomer(s). Thus, when a compound of formula (I) is for instance specified as (ocS, pR), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (aR, ^S) isomer.<br>
The compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (Ia) or Formula (Ib) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (la) or Formula (Ib) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto group (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
The N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of<br>
formula (la) or (Ib) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the<br>
so-called N-oxide.	,<br>
The compounds of formula (la) and (Ib) may be converted to the corresponding Noxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-cbJorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tbutyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life.

Pharmacology<br>
The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly been shown to be suitable for the treatment of bacterial diseases including especially mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent and drug resistant form thereof), M bovis, M. avium and M. marinum. The present invention thus also relates to compounds of Formula (la) or Formula (Ib) as defined hereinabove, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the quaternary amines thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide forms thereof and the pro-drugs thereof, for use as a medicine.<br>
Further, the present invention also relates to the use of a compound of Formula (la) or Formula (Ib), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the quaternary amines thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide forms thereof and the pro-drugs thereof, as well as any of the pharmaceutical compositions thereof as described hereinafter for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a bacterial disease including a mycobacterial disease.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient suffering from, or at risk of, a bacterial disease, including a mycobacterial disease, which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention.<br>
In addition to their activity against mycobacteria, the compounds according to the invention are also active against other bacteria. In general, bacterial pathogens may be classified as either gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens. Antibiotic compounds with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens are generally regarded as having a broad spectrum of activity. The compounds of the present invention are regarded as active against gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacterial pathogens. In particular, the present compounds are active against at least one gram-positive bacterium, preferably against several gram-positive bacteria, more preferably against one or more gram-positive bacteria and/or one or more gram-negative bacteria.<br>
The present compounds have bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity.<br>
Examples of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, include Staphylococci, for example 5. aureus; Enterococci, for example E.faecalis; Streptococci, for example 5. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. pyogens; Bacilli, for example Bacillus subtilis', Listeria, for example Listeria monocytogenes', Haemophilus, for example H. influenza; MoraxeUa, for example M. catarrhalis; Pseudomonas, for example Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Escherichia, for example E. coli. Gram-positive pathogens, for example Staphylococci, Enterococci and Streptococci are particularly important because of the development of resistant strains which are both difficult to treat and difGcult to eradicate from for example a hospital environment once established. Examples of such strains arc methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multiple resistant Enterococcus faecium.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also show activity against resistant bacterial strains.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are especially active against Staphylococcus aureus, including resistant Staphylococcus aureus such as for example methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus pneumoniae.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the present invention are active on those bacteria of which the viability depends on proper functioning of FIFO ATP synlhase. Without being bound to any theory, it is taught that the activity of the present compounds lies in inhibition of the FIFO ATP synthase, in particular the inhibition of the FO complex of the FIFO ATP synthase, more in particular the inhibition of subunit c of the FO<br>
complex of the FIFO ATP synthase, leading to killing of the bacteria by depletion of the cellular ATP levels of the bacteria.<br>
Bacterial infections which may be treated by the present compounds include, for example, central nervous system infections, external ear infections, infections of the middle ear, such as acute otitis media, infections of the cranial sinuses, eye infections, infections of the oral cavity, such as infections of the teeth, gums and mucosa, upper respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, genitourinary infections, gastrointestinal infections, gynaecological infections, septicemia, bone and joint infections, skin and skin structure infections, bacterial endocarditis, burns, antibacterial prophylaxis of surgery, and antibacterial prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients, such as patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, or organ transplant patients.<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter, that the compounds can treat a bacterial infection it is meant that the compounds can treat an infection with one or more bacterial strains.<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter, that the bacterial infection is other than a Mycobacterial infection it is meant that the bacterial infection is other than an infection with one or more Mycobacteria.<br>
The invention also relates to a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention. The compounds according to the invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, maybe included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in  hich the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture, of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations.<br>
Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight of the active ingredient, and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, more preferably from 30 to 99.9 weight % of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may additionally contain various other ingredients known in the art, for example, a lubricant, stabilising agent, buffering agent, emulsifying agent, viscosity-regulating agent, surfactant, preservative, flavouring or colorant.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The daily dosage of the compound according to the invention will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the mycobacterial disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compound according to the invention is administered at a daily dosage not exceeding 1 gram, e.g. in the range from 10 to 50 rug/kg body weight<br>
Given the fact that the compounds of formula (Ia) or Formula (Ib) are active against bacterial infections, the present compounds may be combined with other antibacterial agents in order to effectively combat bacterial infections.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also relates to a combination of (a) a compound<br>
according to the invention, and (b) one or more other antibacterial agents.<br>

D. Pharmacological examples<br>
D. 1. In-vitro method for testing compounds against M. tuberculosis. Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 100 µl of Middlebrook (1x) broth medium. Subsequently, stock solutions (10 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 25 µl volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial five¬fold dilutions were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). Pipette tips were changed after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 5000 CPU per well of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37RV), in a volume of 100 µ,l in Middlebrook<br>
(Ix) broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). One day before the end of incubation, 6 days after inoculation, Resazurin (1:5) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 ul and plates were incubated for another 24 hours at 37°C. On day 7 the bacterial growth was quantitated fJuorometrically.<br>
The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Spectramax Gemini EM, Molecular Devices) at an excitation wavelength of 530 run and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The percentage growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods and expressed as pIC50 values. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
D.2. In-vitro method for testing compounds for anti-bacterial activity against strain M. Smeematis ATCC607.<br>
Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180 µl of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 ul in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). Pipette tips were changed after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 250 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum, in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours in a humidified 5% CO2<br>
atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, two days after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore Alamar Blue (10x) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 µl and plates were incubated for another 2 hours at 50°C.<br>
The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor, Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 ran and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (gain 30). The percentage growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods and expressed as pIC50 values. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>

D.3. In-vitro method for testing compounds for anti-bacterial activity against various<br>
non-mvcobacterial strains<br>
Preparation of 'bacterial suspensions for susceptibility testing:<br>
The bacteria used in this study were grown overnight in flasks containing 100 ml<br>
Mueller-Hinton Broth (Becton Dickinson - cat. no. 275730) in sterile de-ionized water,<br>
with shaking, at 37 °C. Stocks (0.5 ml/tube) were stored at -70 °C until use. Bacteria<br>
titrations were performed in microtiter plates to detect the TCIDjo, in which the<br>
TCID50 represents the dilution that gives rise to bacterial growth in 50 % of<br>
inoculated cultures.<br>
In general, an inoculum level of approximately 100 TCIDso was used for susceptibility<br>
testing.<br>
Anti bacterial Susceptibility testing: IC90 determination<br>
Microtitre plate assay<br>
Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180 µl of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes in column 2. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 µJ in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to reach column 11. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Depending on the bacteria type, approximately 10 to 60 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum (100 TCID50), in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under a normal atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, one day after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to<br>
standard methods. The IC90 (expressed in µg/ml) was defined as the 90 % inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 9.<br>
Agar dilution method.<br>
MIC99 values (the minimal concentration for obtaining 99 % inhibition of bacterial growth) can be determined by performing the standard Agar dilution method according to NCCLS standards1" wherein the media used includes Mueller-Hinton agar.<br>

Time kill assays<br>
Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. Tn a time kill assay on Staphylococcus aweus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum ofS. aurues and MRSA is 10* CPU / ml in Muller Hinton broth. The antibacterial compounds are used at the concentration of 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (i.e. IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Wells receiving no antibacterial agent constitute the culture growth control. The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 °C. After 0,4, 24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10"1 to 10"6) in sterile PBS and plating (200 µl) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 °C for 24 hrs and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logioCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the colonies at highest dilution used for plating.<br>

Determination of cellular ATP levels<br>
In order to analyse the change in the total cellular ATP concentration (using ATP bioluminescence Kit, Roche), assays are carried out by growing a culture of S. aureus (ATCC29213) stock in 100 ml Mueller Hinton flasks and incubate in a shaker-incubator for 24 hrs at 37 °C (300 rpm). Measure OD405 nm and calculate the CFU/ml. Dilute the cultures to 1 x 106 CFU/ml (final concentration for ATP measurement: 1 x 10s CFU/100 µl per well) and add test compound at 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (Le. IC90) as determined in microtitre plate assay). Incubate these tubes for 0, 30 and 60 minutes<br>
at 300 rpm and 37°C. Use 0.6 ml bacterial suspension ftom the snap-cap tubes and add to a new 2 ml eppendorf tubes. Add 0.6 ml cell lysis reagent ( Roche kit), vortex at max speed and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cool on ice. Let the luminometer warm up to 30°C (Luminoskan Ascent Labsystems with injector). Fill one column (= 6 wells) with 100 µl of the same sample. Add 100 µl Luciferase reagent to each well by using the injector system. Measure the luminescence for 1 sec.<br>
