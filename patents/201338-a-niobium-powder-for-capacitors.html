				<td>DESCRIPTION Niobium Powder, Sintered Body and Capacitor Using the Body<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a niobium powder with a large capacitance per unit mass and good leakage current characteristics, a sintered body using the above-mentioned niobium powder, and a capacitor using the above-mentioned sintered body.<br>
Background Art<br>
Capacitors for use in electronic apparatus such as portable telephones and personal computers are required to be small in size and large in capacitance. Of those capacitors, a tantalum capacitor is preferably used, because the capacitance is large, not in proportion to the size, and the tantalum capacitor also has good characteristics. The tantalum capacitor usually employs a sintered body of a tantalum powder as an anode. In order to increase the capacitance of the tantalum capacitor, it is necessary to increase the mass of the sintered body, or to use a sintered body having an increased surface area obtained by pulverizing the tantalum powder.<br>
The increase in mass of the sintered body inevitably enlarges the shape, so that the requirement for a small-sized<br><br>
capacitor is not satisfied. On the other hand, when the tantalum powder is finely pulverized to increase the specific surface area, the pore size in the tantalum sintered body decreases, and the number of closed pores increases during the sintering step. The result is that the sintered body cannot be easily impregnated with a cathode agent in the subsequent step.<br>
One approach to solve these problems is a capacitor using a sintered body of a powder material which has a greater, dielectric constant than the tantalum powder. One powder material which has-such a greater dielectric constant is a niobium powder,<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 55-15722 6 discloses a method for producing a sintered element for a capacitor. This method comprises the steps of subjecting a niobium powder ranging from an agglomerate to fine particles with a particle diameter of 2.0 |im or less to pressure molding and sintering, finely cutting the molded sintered body, connecting a lead portion to the finely cut particles of the sintered body, and thereafter sintering the connected body. However, the above-mentioned application does not describe the detailed characteristics of the obtained capacitor.<br>
United States Patent No. 4, 084, 965 discloses a capacitor using a sintered body of a niobium powder with a particle size of 5.1 vim obtained from a niobium ingot through hydrogenation and pulverizing. The capacitor disclosed has, however, a<br><br>
high leakage current value (hereinafter referred to as an LC value), and therefore the serviceability is poor.<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-242004, the LC value is improved by partially nitriding a niobium powder. However, when a capacitor having a large capacitance is produced using a sintered body of a niobium powder with a smaller particle diameter, the LC value of the obtained capacitor may become exceptionally high.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,051,044 discloses a niobium powder which has a particular BET specific surface area and contains nitrogen in a particular amount. A method for decreasing the leakage current is also disclosed. However, there is no disclosure nor suggestion concerning a niobium powder containing another element which can form an alloy with niobiiom. Furthermore, this patent does not disclose nor suggest the heat resistance necessary for capacitors in soldering and the like or stability of LC value against thermal history.<br>

Detailed Description of The Invention<br>
The capacitor of the present invention which has a large capacitance and good leakage current characteristics, niobium powder and sintered body thereof which attribute to those good capacitor characteristics will be explained with regard to the following four groups ( (1) ^ (4) ) :<br>
(1)	The niobium powder for capacitors comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, and the sintered body thereof (The first group of the invention);<br>
(2)	The niobium powder for capacitors comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium, and the sintered body thereof (The second group of the invention);<br>
(3)	The niobium powder for capacitors comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth, and the sintered body thereof (The third group of the invention); and<br>
(4)	The niobium powder for capacitors comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium.<br><br>
lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium, and the sintered body thereof (The fourth group of the invention).<br>
(l)The First Group (Niobium Powder and Sintered body)<br>
The first group of the present invention relates to a      ■' niobium powder and a sintered body thereof, wherein the niobium powder contains at least one element selected from the transition elements of group 6 in the periodic table, that is, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten.<br>
Chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten aje elements that can form an alloy with niobium. The most effective for lowering the leakage current value is tungsten, while molybdenum and chromium follow in that order. It is therefore most preferable that the niobium powder of the first group of the present invention contains tungsten. Such a tungsten-containing niobium powder may further comprise molybdenum and/or chromium, preferably chromium. The total amount of these elements may be 10 mol% or less, preferably in the range of 0.01 mol% to 10 mol%, more preferably in the range of 0.1 mol% to 7 mol% in the niobium powder.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferable to use" a sintered body of a niobium powder for a capacitor, with the niobium powder containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten in an amount of 10 mol% or less, more preferably in<br><br>
the range of 0.01 mol% to 10 mol% of the niobium powder.<br>
If the content of the above-mentioned element is less than 0.01 mol%, it is impossible to inhibit the tendency whereby oxygen in a dielectric film formed by electrolytic oxidation, to be described later, is apt to diffuse into the niobium metal side. Consequently, the stability of a film obtained by electrolytic oxidation, i*e., dielectric film, cannot be maintained, so that the LC value cannot be effectively lowered. If the content of the above-mentioned element is more than 10 mol%, the amount of niobium itself in the niobium powder decreases . As a result, the capacitance of the capacitor decreases.<br>
In light of the above, the most preferable amount of at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten is in the range of 0.01 to 10 mol%. In order to further reduce the leakage current value, it is preferable that the above-mentioned element be contained in an amount of 3 mol% or less, and more preferably in the range of 0.05 to 3 mol% in the niobium powder.<br>
It is preferable that the niobium powder have a mean particle size (mean particle diameter) of 5 ^m or less, and more preferably 4 pn or less to increase the specific surface area of the powder. Most preferably, the mean particle diameter of the niobium powder of the present invention may be 0.2 pm or more and 5 pm or less. The reason for this is as follows.<br><br>
The capacitance C of a capacitor is generally expressed by the following equation:<br>
C = B X (S/d),<br>
wherein C represents the capacitance, 8 represents the dielectric constant, S represents the specific surface area, and d represents the distance between electrodes.<br>
Since d = k x V, wherein k is a constant and V represents the forming voltage, C = e x (S/(k x V)); hence, it follows that C x V == (e/k) x S.<br>
In view of the equation, the capacitance of the capacitor can be increased merely by increasing the specific surface area. Assuming that the niobium powder has a spherical shape, the smaller the particle diameter of the niobium powder, the larger the capacitance of the obtained capacitor. However, in fact, the niobium powder is not in a completely spherical shape, and occasionally contains flake-shaped particles.<br>
As described above, the characteristics required for the capacitor of the present invention are not only a large capacitance but also good leakage current properties. This cannot be achieved simply by enlarging the specific surface area of the powder.<br>
According to the present invention, by using a niobium powder containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten as a raw material to produce a sintered body, it becomes possible to provide a capacitor capable of satisfying both the above-<br><br>
mentioned capacitor characteristics, and a niobium sintered body that can provide such capacitor characteristics.<br>
TABLE 1 shows the particle diameter and the specific surface area of respective tungsten-containing niobium powders which the inventors of the present invention prepared through pulverizing as one embodiment.<br><br>
The mean particle size herein used is a value D5Q, which<br>
represents a particle diameter, measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus '^Microtrac" (trademark), made by Microtrac Corporation, when the mass percentage reaches 50% by cumulative distribution by mass. The specific surface area is a value measured by the BET method.<br>
When the mean particle size of the niobium powder containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten is less than 0.05 pm, a sintered body made from the niobium powder has a small pore size and has many closed pores. Therefore, there is a tendency for the sintered body to be not easilv<br><br>
impregnated with an agent for cathode as described later. The result is that the capacitance of the obtained capacitor cannot be increased, and therefore, the above-mentioned sintered body is not suitable for capacitors. When the mean particle size exceeds 5 ym, a large capacitance cannot be obtained.<br>
In light of the above-mentioned points, a large capacitance can be obtained in the present invention by employing a niobium powder preferably having a mean particle size of 0.05 \xm  or more and 5 |am or less.<br>
It is preferable that the niobium powder of the present invention have a BET specific surface area of at least 0.5 m^/g, more preferably at least 1. 0 m^/g, and further preferably at least 2.0 mVg. In addition, it is preferable that the niobium powder of the present invention be a powder with a BET specific surface area of 0.5 to 40 m^/g, more preferably 1 to 20 m^/g, and particularly preferably 1 to 10 m^/g.<br>
It is known that the dielectric constant (e) of niobium is about two times greater than that of tantalum. However, it is not known whether chromium, molybdenum, or tungsten is a valve metal that is one of the capacitor characteristics. Therefore it has not been known that the dielectric constant 8 of the niobium powder containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten will increase.<br>
In the present invention, when the niobium powder<br><br>
containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten is controlled to have a small mean particle size and is made into a sintered body with a large capacitance, as mentioned above, there is no peculiar increase in the LC value.<br>
This action is assumed to be as follows. The bonding strength between niobium and oxygen is greater than that between tantalum and oxygen. Therefore, oxygen in a film prepared by electrolytic oxidation, i.e., a dielectric film, tends to diffuse into the side of a niobium metal. However, because part of the niobium and at least one element of chromium, molybdenum, or tungsten are bonded together in the sintered body of the present invention, there is less chance for oxygen in the electrolytic oxidation film to be bonded to niobium, thereby preventing oxygen from diffusing into the metal.<br>
As a result, it is possible to maintain the stability of the electrolytic oxidation film, and therefore, it is considered that the effect of decreasing the LC value and minimizing the dispersion of the LC value can be obtained in a capacitor with a high capacitance prepared from the niobium powder with a small particle diameter.<br>
The present invention will now be described by taking tungsten as an example of the transition elements of the group 6 in the periodic table. The present invention is not limited to this example, but also applies to the case where chromium<br><br>
or molybdenum is used.<br>
It is particularly preferable that the tungsten-containing niobium powder used to prepare a sintered body have a mean particle size of 0.2 pm or more and 5 pm or less as mentioned above.<br>
The tungsten-containing niobium powder having such a mean particle size can be prepared from, for example, a hydride of a niobium - tungsten alloy in the form of an ingot, pellet, or powder through pulverizing and dehydrogenation. Alternatively, a niobium powder prepared by subjecting a hydride of a niobium ingot,,pellet, or powder to pulverizing and dehydrogenation, or by pulverizing a sodium reduced form of potassium fluoroniobate, is mixed with tungsten carbide, tungsten oxide, or tungsten powder. Or, a mixture of niobium oxide and tungsten oxide may be subj ected to carbon reduction.<br>
For example, when the tungsten-containing niobium powder is prepared from a hydride of a niobium - tungsten alloy ingot through pulverizing and dehydrogenation, a tungsten-containing niobium powder with a desired mean particle size can be obtained by adjusting the content of hydride in the niobium - tungsten alloy, and the pulverizing time and a pulverizer.<br>
Further, a niobixim powder with a mean particle size of from 0.2 ]xm or more to 5 lam or less may be added to . the tungsten-containing niobium powder thus obtained. The niobium powder to, be added can be prepared, for example, by<br><br>
pulverizing a sodium reduced form of potassium f luoroniobate, or subjecting a hydride of a niobium ingot to pulverizing and dehydrogenation, or by subjecting niobium oxide to carbon reduction.<br>
In order to further improve the leakage current value in a sintered body of the obtained tungsten-containing niobium powder, the tungsten-containing niobium powder may be partially bonded to at least one of nitrogen, carbon, boron, or sulfur. Any of the tungsten-containing niobium nitride, tungsten-containing niobium carbide, tungsten-containing niobium boride, and tungsten-containing niobium sulfide, resulting from the bonding to nitrogen, carbon, boron, and sulfur, respectively may be added alone, or the two to four kinds may be selectively contained.<br>
The amount of element for bonding, that is, the total content of carbon, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur, which depends upon the shape of the tungsten-containing niobium powder, may be more than 0 ppm and not more than 200,000 ppm, preferably in the range of 50 ppm to 100,000 ppm, and more preferably 200 ppm to 20,000 ppm when the tungsten-containing niobium powder has a mean particle size from 0,05 ym to 5 pm. When the total content exceeds 200,000 ppm, the capacitance characteristics deteriorate to such an extent that the niobium powder becomes unsuitable for a capacitor.<br>
Nitridation of the tungsten-containing niobium powder can be performed by any of liquid nitridation, ion nitridation.<br><br>
or gas nitridation, or by a combination of those inethods . Gas nitridation under a nitrogen gas atmosphere is preferred because the system can be made simple and the operation can be made easy.<br>
For example, according to gas nitridation under a nitrogen atmosphere, the tungsten-containing niobium powder may be allowed to stand under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The tungsten-containing niobium powder partially nitrided to a desired extent can be obtained at a nitriding atmosphere temperature of 2000*^0 or less within one hundred hours. An increase in processing temperature can curtail the processing. time.<br>
The tungsten-containing niobium powder can be carbonized by any method of gas carbonization, solid-phase carbonization, or liquid carbonization. For example, the tungsten-containing niobium powder may be allowed to stand together with a carbon source of a carbon-containing organic material such as a carbon material or methane at 2000*^0 or less under reduced pressure for one minute to one hundred hours.<br>
The tungsten-containing niobium powder can be borided by gas boronization or solid-phase boronization. For example, the tungsten-containing niobium powder may be allowed to stand together with a boron source such as boron pellets or boron halide, i.e., trifluoroboron under reduced pressure at temperatures of 2000°C or less for one minute to<br><br>
one hundred hours.<br>
The tungsten-containing niobium powder can be sulfided by any of gas sulfidation, ion sulfidation, or solid-phase sulfidation. For example/ according to gas sulfidation under a sulfur gas atmosphere, the tungsten-containing niobium powder may be allowed to stand under a sulfur atmosphere. The tungsten-containing niobium powder sulfided to a desired extent can be obtained at temperatures of 2000°C or less and a standing time of one hundred hours ' or less. The higher the processing temperature, the shorter the processing time. .<br>
According to the present invention, the tungsten-containing niobium powder can be used for a capacitor after granulation to have a desired configuration. Alternatively, the granulated powder may be mixed with a proper amount of ungranulated niobium powder after granulation.<br>
With respect to the granulation method, the tungsten-containing niobium powder not subj ected to granulation is allowed to stand under high vacuum, heated to an appropriate temperature, and then subjected to cracking. Alternatively, the tungsten-containing niobium powder not subjected to granulation is mixed with an appropriate binder such as camphor, polyacrylic acid, poly(methyl acrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol), and a solvent such as acetone, alcohol, acetate, or water, and thereafter the resulting mixture is subjected to cracking.<br><br>
The tungsten-containing niobium powder thus granulated can improve pressure-moldability in the preparation of a sintered body. In this case, it is preferable that the granulated powder have a mean particle size of 10 \im to 500 lam. When the mean particle size of the granulated powder is 10 ym or less, partial blocking takes place, which degrades the flowability toward a mold. When the granulated powder has a mean particle size of 500 \im or more, an angular portion of a molded article is easily chipped off after pressure molding. Granulated powders have preferably a mean particle size of 30 ]im to 250 ym, and particularly preferably of 60 Vim to 250 ym because the sintered body is easily impregnated with a negative electrode material after pressure molding of the niobium powder in the production of a capacitor.<br>
The  above-mentioned  nitridation,  carbonization, boronization, and sulfidation can be carried out, not only for the niobium powder, but also for the granulated niobium powder and for the niobium sintered body.<br>
The tungsten-containing niobiiim sintered body for a capacitor according to the present invention is produced by sintering the aforementioned tungsten-containing niobium powder or the granulated tungsten-containing niobium powder. An example of a method for producing the sintered body will be described later, but does not limit the present invention. For instance, a tungsten-containing niobium powder is subjected to pressure molding to have a predetermined shape.<br><br>
and the molded material is heated at SOO^C to 2000°C, preferably 900°C to ISOO^C, and more preferably 900°C to 1300°C under the application of a pressure of 10'^ to 10^ Pa (pascal) for one minute to ten hours.<br>
(2)The Second Group (Niobium Powder and Sintered Body)<br>
In the second group of the present invention, a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium is used as a starting material of the niobium powder.<br>
The boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium for use in the present invention are elements capable of forming an alloy with niobium and among these, boron and aluminum have an effect of most reducing the leakage current and next effective are gallium, indium and thallium in this order. Accordingly, in the present invention, boron or aluminum is particularly preferably incorporated into the niobium powder. The boron-containing niobium powder may further contain aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium. The total content of these elements in the niobium powder is 10 mol% or less, preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol% and more preferably from 0.1 to 7 mol%. In other words, the niobium powder formed into a sintered body and used for a capacitor in the present invention preferably contains at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium, in the range of 10 mol% or less, more preferably<br><br>
from 0. 01 to 10 mol% and particularly preferably 0 .1 to 7 mol% .<br>
If the content of the element is less than 0.01 mol%, oxygen in the dielectric film formed by the electrolytic oxidation which is described later cannot be inhibited from diffusing toward the internal niobium metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film (the dielectric film) cannot be maintained and the effect of reducing LC can be hardly obtained. On the other hand, if the content of the element exceeds 10 mol%, the content of the niobium itself in the niobium powder is reduced, as a result, the capacitance as a capacitor decreases.<br>
Accordingly, the content of at least one element selected from the group consisting of the boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium is preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol%. In order to more reduce the leakage current, the content of the element in the niobium powder is preferably 7 mol% or less, more preferably from 0.10 to 7 mol%.<br>
In order to increase the specific surface area of powder, the niobium powder of the present invention preferably has a mean particle size of 5 ^m or less, more preferably 4 ^im or less. Also, the mean particle size of the niobium powder of the present invention is preferably from 0.05 to 4 |Jiu. The reasons therefor are described above with regard to the niobium powder of the first group.<br>
In the present invention, the starting material niobium powder used for manufacturing a sintered body is a niobium<br><br>
powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium, whereby a capacitor satisfying both of the above-described properties or a niobium sintered body capable of ensuring those capacitor properties can be provided.<br>
The mean particle size (D50, |im) and the specif ic surface<br>
area  (S,  m^/g)  of a boron-containing niobium powder<br>
manufactured as one example by the present inventors<br>
(produced by a pulverization method) are shown in Table 2<br>
below.<br><br>
The mean particle size (D50; J-im) shown in Table 2 above is a value measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus ("Microtrac", trade name, manufactured byMicrotrac Company) (the D50 value indicates a particle size<br><br><br>
If the mean particle size of the niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium exceeds 5 |im, a capacitor having a large capacitance cannot be obtained, whereas if the mean particle size is less than 0.05 |im, the pore size becomes small and closed pores increase when a sintered body is produced from the powder, therefore, a cathode material which is described later cannot be easily impregnated, as a result, the niobium powder cannot provide a capacitor having a large capacitance and the sintered body thereof is not suitable for use in a capacitor.^<br>
From these reasons, the niobium powder for use in the present invention preferably has a mean particle size of 0.05 to 4 ^m, whereby a large-capacitance capacitor can be obtained.<br>
The niobium powder of the present invention is preferably a powder having a BET specific surface area of at least 0.5 m^/g, more preferably at least 1 m^/g, and still more preferably at least 2 mVg. Also, the niobium powder of the present invention preferably has a BET specific surface area of 0.5 to 40 mVg, more preferably from 1 to 20 m^/g and particularly preferably from 1 to 10 mVg-<br>
With respect to the dielectric constant (e) , niobium is known to have a dielectric constant as large as about two times the dielectric constant of tantalum, however, whether or not boron, gallium, indium and thallium are a valve metal<br><br>
having capacitor properties is not known. Aluminum is a valve acting metal but the dielectric constant thereof is known to be smaller than that of niobium. Accordingly, even when at least one element selected from the group consisting of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium is incorporated into niobium, it is not known whether e of the niobium powder containing the element increases.<br>
According to the investigations by the present inventors, even when the niobium powder is reduced in the mean particle size and a sintered body having a high capacitance is manufactured therefrom, the LC value is not peculiarly increased insofar as at least one element of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium is contained.<br>
The reasons for this result are presumed as follows.<br>
Niobium has a high bonding strength to an oxygen element as compared with tantalum and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film (dielectric material film) is liable to diffuse toward the internal niobium metal side, however, in the sintered body of the present invention, a part of niobium is bonded to at least one element of boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film is not easily bonded to the internal niobium metal and inhibited from diffusing toward the metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film can be maintained and an effect of reducing the LC value and the dispersion thereof even in the case of a capacitor<br><br>
having a fine particle size and a high capacitance can be attained.<br>
The present invention is described below using boron as an example, however, the present invention is not limited thereto and the following content can be applied also to the cases using aluminum, gallium, indium or thallium.<br>
A boron-containing niobium power for use in the manufacture of a sintered body preferably has a mean particle size of 0.05 to 4 |im as described above.<br>
The boron-containing niobium powder having such a mean particle size can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of a niobium-boron alloy ingot, pellet or powder.<br>
The boron-containing niobium powder can also be obtained by a method of mixing boric acid, boron oxide and boron powder with a niobium powder formed by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of a niobium ingot, pellet or powder, by pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium f luoroniobate or by pulverizing a reduction product resulting from reducing a niobium oxide using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesiiam, aluminum, or by a method of carbon-reducing a mixture of niobium oxide and boron oxide.<br>
For example, in the case of obtaining a niobium powder by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of a niobium-boron alloy ingot, a boron-containing niobium powder having a desired mean particle size can be obtained by<br><br>
controlling the amount of the niobium-boron alloy ingot hydrogenated, the pulverization time, the grinding machine or the like. The thus-obtained boron-containing niobium powder may be mixed with a niobium powder having a mean particle size of 5 |im or less to adjust the boron content. The niobium powder added here may be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium fluoroniobate, a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydroxide of a niobium ingot, a method of reducing a niobium oxide using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium and aluminum, or a method of hydrogen-reducing a niobium halide.<br>
In order to further improve the leakage current value of the thus-obtained boron-containing niobium powder, a part of the boron-containing niobium powder may be surface-treated by nitridation, carbonization, sulfidation and further boronization. The powder may comprise any of these products obtained by the surface-treatment of nitridation, carbonization, sulfidation or boronization, more specifically, the powder may comprise any of boron-containing niobium nitride, boron-containing niobium carbide, boron-containing niobium sulfide and boron-containing niobium boride. The powder may also comprise two, three or four of these products in combination.<br>
The sum total of the bonding amounts, that is, the total content of nitrogen,  carbon,  boron and sulfur varies<br><br>
depending on the shape of the boron-containing niobium powder, however, in the case of a powder having a mean particle size of approximately from 0.05 to 5 \xm, the total content is more than 0 ppm and not more than 200,000 ppm, preferably from 50 to 200,000 ppm, more preferably from 200 to 20,000 ppm. If the total content exceeds 200,000 ppm, the capacitance characteristics are deteriorated and the fabricated product is not suitable as a capacitor.<br>
The nitridation of the boron-containing niobium powder can be performed by any one of liquid nitridation, ion nitridation and gas nitridation or by a combination thereof. Among these, gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere is preferred because the apparatus therefor is simple and the operation is easy. For example, the gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the above-described boron-containing niobium powder to stand in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of one hundred hours or less, a boron-containing niobium powder having an objective nitrided amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing this treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The carbonization of the boron-containing niobium powder may be any one of gas carbonization, solid-phase carbonization and liquid carbonization. For example, the boron-containing niobiumpowder may be carbonized by allowing<br><br>
it to stand together with a carbon material or a carbon source such as an organic material having carbon (e.g., methane), at 2,000°C or less under reduced pressure for one minute to one hundred hours.<br>
The sulf idation of the boron-containing niobium powder may be any one of gas sulfidation, ion sulfidation and solid-phase sulfidation. For example, the gas sulfidation in a sulfur gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the boron-containing niobium powder to stand in a sulfur atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of one hundred hours or less, a boron-containing niobium powder having an objective sulfudized amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The boronization of the boron-containing niobium powder may be either gas boronization or solid-phase boronization. For example, the boron-containing niobium powder may be boronized by allowing it to stand together with a boron source such as boron pellet or boron halide (e.g., trifluoroboron), at 2,006°C or less for one minute to one hundred hours under reduced pressure.<br>
The boron-containing niobium powder for capacitors of the present invention may be used after granulating the boron-containing niobium powder into an appropriate shape or may be used by mixing an appropriate amount of non-granulated<br><br>
niobium powder after the above-described granulation.<br>
Examples of the granulation method include a method where non-granulated boron-containing niobium powder is allowed to stand in a high vacuum, heated to an appropriate temperature and then cracked, and a method where non-granulated boron-containing niobium powder is mixed with an appropriate binder such as camphor, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl acrylic acid ester or polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols, acetic acid esters or water, and then cracked.<br>
The boron-containing niobium powder granulated as such is improved in the press-molding property at the production of a sintered body. The mean particle size of the granulated powder is preferably from 10 to 500 \xm. If the mean particle size of the granulated powder is less than 10 ^im, partial blocking takes place and the fluidity into a metal mold deteriorates, whereas if it exceeds 500 jam, the molded article after the press-molding is readily broken at the corner parts . The mean particle size of the granulated powder is more preferably from 30 to 250 ^m because a cathode agent can be easily impregnated at the manufacture of a capacitor after sintering the press-molded article.<br>
The boron-containing niobium sintered body for capacitors of the present invention is produced by sintering the above-described boron-containing niobium powder or granulated boron-containing niobiiim powder. The production<br><br>
method for the sintered body is not particularly limited, however, the sintered body may be obtained, for example, by press-molding the boron-containing niobium powder into a predetermined shape and then heating it at 500 to 2,000°C, preferably from 900 to 1,500°C, more preferably from 900 to 1,300°C, for one minute to ten hours under a pressure of 10"^ to 10^ Pa.<br>
(3)The Third Group (Niobium Powder and Sintered Body)<br>
In the third group of the present invention, a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth can used as a starting material of the niobium powder.<br>
The cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth are elements capable of forming an alloy with niobium. In particular, a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rhenium, neodymium, zinc, arsenic, phosphorus, germanium and tin is preferred, and a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rhenium, neodymium and zinc is more preferred. In one embodiment, the niobium powder is, for example, a rhenium-containing niobium powder comprising at least one<br><br>
element of cerium, neodymium, titanium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth. In the present invention, the total content of these elements in the niobium powder is 10 mol% or less, preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol%, more preferably from 0.1 to 7 mol%.<br>
If the total content of the element is less than 0.01 mol%/ oxygen in the dielectric film formed by the electrolytic oxidation which is described later cannot be inhibited from diffusing toward the niobium metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film (the dielectric film) cannot be maintained and the effect of reducing LC can be hardly obtained. On the other hand, if the total content of the element exceeds 10 mol%, the content of the niobium itself in the niobium powder is reduced, as a result, the capacitance as a capacitor decreases.<br>
Accordingly, the total content of at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth is preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol%.<br>
In order to more reduce the leakage current, the content of the element in the niobium powder is preferably 7 mol% or less, more preferably from 0.1 to 7 mol%.<br>
In order to increase the specific surface area of powder,  the niobium powder of the present invention<br><br>
preferably has a mean particle size of 5 |JJU or less, more preferably 4 }im or less. Also, the mean particle size of the niobium powder is preferably from 0.05 to 4 pm. The reasons therefor are described above with regard to the niobium powder of the first group.<br>
In the present invention, the starting material niobium powder used for manufacturing a sintered body is a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth, whereby a capacitor satisfying both of the above-described properties or a niobium sintered body capable of ensuring those capacitor properties can be provided.<br>
The mean particle size (D50, |im) and the specif ic surf ace<br>
area  (S, m^/g)  of a rhenium-containing niobium powder<br>
manufactured as one example by the present inventors<br>
(produced by a pulverization method) are shown in Table 3<br>
below.<br><br><br>
The mean particle size (D50; ^im) shown in Table 3 is a value measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus ("Microtrac", trade name, manufactured by Microtrac Company) (the D^Q value indicates a particle size when the cumulative % by mass corresponds to 50% by mass). The specific surface area is a value measured by the BET method.<br>
If the mean particle size of the niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth exceeds 5 jim, a capacitor having a large capacitance cannot be obtained, whereas if the mean particle size is less than 0.05 pju, the pore size becomes small and closed pores increase when a sintered body is produced from the powder, therefore, a cathode material which is described later cannot be easily impregnated, as a result, the niobium powder cannot provide<br><br>
a capacitor having a large capacitance and the sintered body thereof is not suitable for use in a capacitor.<br>
From these reasons, the niobium powder for use in the present invention preferably has a mean particle size of 0.05 to 5 |im, whereby a large-capacitance capacitor can be obtained.<br>
The niobium powder of the present invention is preferably a powder having a BET specific surface area of at least 0.5 mVg, more preferably at least 1 m^/g, and still more preferably at least 2 m^/g. Also, the niobium powder of the present invention preferably has a BET specific surface area of 0.5 to 40 mVg, more preferably from 1 to 20 mVg and particularly preferably from 1 to 10 mVg-<br>
With respect to the dielectric constant (e) , niobium is known to have a dielectric constant as large as about two times the dielectric constant of tantalum, however, whether cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth are a valve metal having capacitor properties is not known. Accordingly, even when at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth is incorporated into niobium, it is not known whether 8 of the niobium powder containing the element increases.<br><br>
According to the investigations by the present inventors, even when the niobium powder is reduced in the mean particle size and a sintered body having a high capacitance is manufactured therefrom, the LC value is not peculiarly increased insofar as at least one element of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth is contained.<br>
The reasons for this result are presumed as follows.<br>
Niobium has a high bonding strength to an oxygen element as compared with tantalum and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film (dielectric material film) is liable to diffuse toward the internal niobium metal side, however, in the sintered body of the present invention, a part of niobium is bonded to at least one element of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film is not easily bonded to the internal niobium metal and inhibited from diffusing toward the metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film can be maintained and an effect of reducing the LC value and the dispersion thereof even in the case of a capacitor having a fine particle size and a high capacitance can be attained.<br>
The present invention is described below mainly using rhenium as an example, however, the present invention is not<br><br>
limited thereto and the following contents are applied also to the cases using at least one element selected from the group consisting of cerium, neodymium, titanium, rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, zinc, silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic and bismuth.<br>
The rhenium-containing niobium power for use in the manufacture of a sintered body preferably has a mean particle size of 0.05 to 4 |im as described above.<br>
The rhenium-containing niobium powder having such a mean particle size can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium-rhenium alloy ingot, pellet or powder. The rhenium-containing niobium powder can also be obtained by a method of mixing rhenium powder or an oxide, sulfide, sulfate, halide salt, nitrate, organic acid salt or complex salt of rhenium with a niobium powder formed by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot, pellet or powder, by pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium fluoroniobate or by pulverizing a reduction product of niobiuma oxide reduced using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesixom, aluminum and the like; or by a method of magnesium-reducing a mixture of niobium oxide and rhenium oxide.<br>
The niobium powder containing rhenium, zinc and germanium can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium-<br><br>
rhenium-zinc-germanium alloy ingot, pellet or powder.  This<br>
■ niobium powder can also be obtained by a method of mixing<br>
rhenium powder, zinc powder and germanium powder, or oxides,<br>
sulfides, sulfates, halide salts, nitrates or organic acid<br>
salts of rhenium, zinc, germanium with a niobium powder formed<br>
by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot,<br>
pellet or powder, by pulverizing a sodium reduction product<br>
of potassium fluoroniobate or by pulverizing a reduction<br>
product of niobium oxide reduced using at least one member<br>
of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium, aluminum and the like; or by<br>
a method of magnesium-reducing a mixture of niobium oxide,<br>
rhenium oxide, zinc oxide and germanium oxide.<br>
For example, in the case of obtaining the rhenium-containing niobium powder by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of a niobium-rhenium alloy ingot, a rhenium-containing niobium powder having a desired mean particle size can be obtained by controlling the amount of the niobiiom-rhenium alloy hydrogenated, the pulverization time, the grinding machine or the like.<br>
The thus-obtained rhenium-containing niobium powder nay be mixed with a niobium powder having a mean particle size :)f 5 urn or less to adjust the rhenium content. The niobium Dowder added here may be obtained, for example, by a method :)f pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium fluoroniobate, a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating i hydride of niobium ingot, a method of reducing a niobium<br><br>
oxide using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium and aluminum, or a method of hydrogen-reducing a niobium halide. In order to further improve the leakage current value of the thus-obtained rhenium-containing niobium powder, a part of the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be surface-treated by nitridation, boronization, carbonization or sulfidation. Any of the rhenium-containing niobium nitride, rhenium-containing niobium boride, rhenium-containing niobium carbide and rhenium-containing niobium sulfide, obtained by the surface-treatment using nitridation, boronization, carbonization or sulfidation, may be contained or two, three or four thereof may also be contained in combination.<br>
The amount bonded thereof, that is, the total content of nitrogen, boron, carbon and sulfur varies depending on the shape of the rhenium-containing niobium powder, however, in the case of powder having a mean particle size of approximately from 0.05 to 5 |am, the total content is more than 0 ppm and not more than 200,000 ppm, preferably from 50 to 100,000 ppm, particularly preferably from 200 to 20,000 ppm. If the total content exceeds 200,000 ppm, the capacitance properties are deteriorated and the fabricated product is not suitable as a capacitor.<br>
The nitridation of the rhenium-containing niobium powder can be performed by any one of liquid nitridation, ion nitridation and gas nitridation or by a combination thereof.<br><br>
Among these, gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere is preferred because the apparatus therefor is simple and the operation is easy. For example, the gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the above-described rhenium-containing niobium powder to stand in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of one hundred hours or less, a rhenium-containing niobium powder having an objective nitrided amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing this treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The boronization of the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be either gas boronization or solid-phase boronization. For example, the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be boronized by allowing a boron-containing niobium powder to stand together with a boron source such as boron pellet or boron halide (e.g., trifluoroboron) , at 2,000^C or less for one minute to one hundred hours under reduced pressure.<br>
The carbonization of the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be any one of gas carbonization, solid-phase carbonization and liquid carbonization. For example, the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be carbonized by allowing it to stand together with a carbon source such as a carbon material or an organic material having carbon (e.g., methane), at 2,000°C or less for one minute to one hundred<br><br>
hours under reduced pressure,<br>
The sulfidation of the rhenium-containing niobium powder may be any one of gas sulfidation, ion sulfidation and solid-phase sulfidation. For example, the gas sulfidation in a sulfur gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the rhenium-containing niobium powder to stand in a sulfur atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of one hundred hours or less, a rhenium-containing niobium powder having an objective sulfudized amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The rhenium-containing niobium powder for capacitors of the present invention may be used after granulating the rhenium-containing niobium powder into an appropriate shape or may be used by mixing an appropriate amount of non-granulated niobium powder after the above-described granulation.<br>
Examples of the granulation method include a method where non-granulated rhenium-containing niobium powder is allowed to stand in a high vacuum and heated to an appropriate temperature and then the mixture is cracked, and a method where non-granulated or granulated rhenium-containing niobium powder is mixed with an appropriate binder such as camphor, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl acrylic acid ester or polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols.<br><br>
acetic acid esters or water, and then the mixture is cracked.<br>
The rhenium-containing niobium powder granulated as such is improved in the press-molding property at the production of a sintered body. The mean particle size of the granulated powder is preferably from 10 to 500 pm. If the mean particle size of the granulated powder is less than 10 \im, partial blocking takes place and the fluidity into a metal mold deteriorates, whereas if it exceeds 500 |am, the molded article after the press-molding is readily broken at the corner parts . The mean particle size of the granulated powder is more preferably from 30 to 250 [im because a cathode agent can be easily impregnated at the manufacture of a capacitor after sintering the press-molded article.<br>
The rhenium-containing niobium sintered body for capacitors of the present invention is produced by sintering the above-described rhenium-containing niobium powder or granulated rhenium-containing niobium powder. The production method for the sintered body is not particularly limited, however, the sintered body may be obtained, for example, by press-molding the rhenium-containing niobium powder into a predetermined shape and then heating it at 500 to 2,000°C, preferably from 900 to 1,500°C, more preferably from 900 to 1, 300°C, for one minute for one hundred hours under a pressure of 10'^ to 10^ Pa (pascal) .<br>
(4) The Fourth Invention (Niobium Powder and Sintered Body)<br><br>
In the fourth group of the present invention, a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium,  yttrium,  lanthanum,  praseodymium,  samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium can used as a starting material of the niobium powder capable of satisfying the capacitor properties.<br>
The rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, sulfur, selenium and tellurium are elements capable of forming an alloy with niobium. In particular, a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of lanthanum, yttrium, erbium, ytterbium and lutetium is preferred, and a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of lanthanum and yttrium is more preferred.<br>
In one embodiment, the niobium powder is, for example, a lanthanum-containing niobium powder comprising at least one element of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium,  yttrium,  praseodymium,  samarium,  europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium.<br><br>
ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, r selenium and tellurium. In the present invention, the total content of these elements in the niobium powder is 10 mol% or less, preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol%, more preferably from 0.1 to 7 mol%.<br>
If the total content of the element is less than 0.01 mol%, oxygen in the dielectric film formed by the electrolytic oxidation which is described later cannot be inhibited from diffusing toward the niobium metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film (the dielectric film) cannot be maintained and the effect of reducing LC can be hardly obtained. On the other hand, if the total content of the element exceeds 10 mol%, the content of the niobium itself in the niobium powder is reduced, as a result, the capacitance as a capacitor decreases,<br>
Accordingly, the total content of at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium is preferably from 0.01 to 10 mol%.<br>
In order to more reduce the leakage current, the content of the element in the niobium powder is preferably 7 mol% or<br><br>
V<br>
less, more preferably from 0.1 to 7 mol%.<br>
In order to increase the specific surface area of powder, the niobium powder of the present invention preferably has a mean particle size of 5 |im or less, more preferably 4 \im or less. Also, the mean particle size of the niobium powder is preferably from 0.05 to 4 |am. The reasons therefor are described above with regard to the niobium powder of the first group.<br>
In the present invention, the starting material niobium used for manufacturing a sintered body is a niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium,  yttrium,  lanthanum,  praseodymium,  samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium, whereby a capacitor satisfying both of the above-described properties or a niobium sintered body capable of ensuring those capacitor properties can be provided.<br>
The mean particle size (D50, |im) and the specif ic surf ace area (S, m^/g) of a lanthanum-containing niobium powder manufactured as one example by the present inventors (all produced by a pulverization method) are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br>
The mean particle size (Dr^o/ 1-^) shown in Table 4 is a value measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus ("Microtrac", trade name, manufactured by Microtrac Company) (the D^^ value indicates a particle size when the cumulative % by mass corresponds to 50'^ by mass) . The specific surface area is a value measured by the BET method.<br>
If the mean particle size of the niobium powder comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium,  yttrium,  lanthanum,  praseodymium,  samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium exceeds 5 |im, a capacitor having a large capacitance cannot be obtained, whereas if the mean particle size is less than 0.05 \xm,   the pore size becomes small and closed pores increase when a sintered body is produced from the powder.<br><br>
therefore, a cathode material which is described later cannot be easily impregnated, as a result, the niobium powder cannot provide a capacitor having a large capacitance and the sintered body thereof is not suitable for use in a capacitor.<br>
From these reasons, the niobium powder for use in the present invention preferably has a mean particle size of 0.05 to 5 |im, whereby a large-capacitance capacitor can be obtained.<br>
The niobium powder of the present invention is preferably a powder having a BET specific surface area of at least 0.5 m^/g, more preferably at least 1 mVg, and still more preferably at least 2 mVg. Also, the niobium powder of the present invention preferably has a BET specific surface area of 0.5 to 40 m^/g, more preferably from 1 to 20 m^/g, and particularly preferably from 1 to 10 m^/g.<br>
With respect to the dielectric constant (e) , niobium is known to have a dielectric constant as large as about two times the dielectric constant of tantalum, however, whether rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium are a valve metal having capacitor properties is not known. Accordingly, even when at least one element selected from the group consisting of rubidium, cesium.<br><br>
magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead,-3«i*a3ft--&gt; selenium and tellurium is incorporated into niobium, it is not known whether s of the niobium powder containing the element increases,<br>
According to  the  investigations by the present inventors, even when the niobium powder is reduced in the mean particle size and a sintered body having a high capacitance is manufactured therefrom, the LC value is not peculiarly increased insofar as at least one element of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium,  samarium,  europium,  gadolinium,  terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium is contained.<br>
The reasons for this result are presumed as follows.<br>
Niobium has a high bonding strength to an oxygen element as compared with tantalum and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film (dielectric material film) is liable to diffuse toward the internal niobium metal side, however, in the sintered body of the present invention, a part of niobium is bonded to at least one element of rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium,  samarium,  europium,  gadolinium,  terbium,<br><br>
::ontaining niobium powder can also be obtained by a method of mixing lanthanum powder or a hydride, oxide, sulfide, sulfate, halide salt, nitrate, organic acid salt or complex salt of lanthanum with a niobium powder formed by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot, pellet or powder, by pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium f luoroniobate or by pulverizing a reduction product Df niobium oxide reduced using at least one member of hydrogen, zarbon, magnesium, aluminum and the like; or by a method of Tiagnesium-reducing a mixture of niobium oxide and lanthanum Dxide.<br>
The niobium powder containing lanthanum, hafnium and iridium can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium-lanthanum-hafnium- iridium alloy ingot, pellet or powder. This niobium powder can also be obtained by a method of mixing lanthanum powder, hafnium powder and iridium powder, or hydrides, oxides, sulfides, sulfates, halide salts, nitrates or organic acid salts of lanthanum, hafnium and iridium with a niobium powder formed by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot, pellet or powder, by pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium fluoroniobate or by pulverizing a reduction product of niobium oxide reduced using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium, aluminum and the like; or by a method of magnesium-reducing a mixture of niobium oxide, lanthanum oxide, hafnium oxide<br><br>
and iridium oxide.<br>
For example, in the case of obtaining the lanthanum-containing niobium powder by pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of a niobium-lanthanum alloy ingot, a lanthanum-containing niobium powder having a desired mean particle size can be obtained by controlling the amount of the niobium-lanthanum alloy hydrogenated, the pulverization time, the grinding machine or the like.<br>
In the niobium ingot usually used as a starting material<br>
of the thus-obtained lanthanum-containing niobium powder,<br>
* the c®ritents of tantalum and metal element other than the<br>
elements  described  above  (namely,  rubidium,  cesium,<br>
magnesium, strontium,:iJ^arium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum,<br>
praseodymium,  samarium,  europium,  gadolinium,  terbium,<br>
dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium,<br>
hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, cadmium,<br>
mercury, lead, selenium and tellurium) each is 1,000 ppm or<br>
less and the oxygen content is from 3,000 to 60,000 ppm.<br>
These contents show the same values also in the niobium<br>
powder containing the element described above (namely, at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
rubidium, cesium, magnesium, strontium, barium, scandium,<br>
yttrium,  lanthanum,  praseodymium,  samarium,  europium,<br>
gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium,<br>
ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, vanadium, osmium, iridium,<br>
platinum,  gold,  cadmium,  mercury,  lead,  selenium and<br><br>
tellurium).<br>
The thus-obtained lanthanum-containing niobium powder may be mixed with a niobium powder having a mean particle size of 5 |.un or less to adjust the lanthanum content. The niobium powder added here may be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing a sodium reduction product of potassium fluoroniobate, a method of pulverizing and dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot, a method of reducing a niobium oxide using at least one member of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium and aluminum, or a method of hydrogen-reducing a niobium halide.<br>
The lanthanum-containing niobium powder for capacitors of the present invention may be used after granulating the lanthanum-containing niobium powder into an appropriate shape or may be used by mixing an appropriate amount of non-granulated niobium powder after the above-described granulation.<br>
Examples of the granulation method include a method where non-granulated lanthanum-containing niobium powder is allowed to stand under highly reduced pressure, heated to an appropriate temperature and then the mixture is cracked, a method where non-granulated or granulated lanthanum-containing niobium powder is mixed with an appropriate binder such as camphor, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl acrylic acid ester or polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols, acetic acid esters or water, and then the mixture<br><br>
is cracked, a method where non-granulated or granulated lanthanum-containing niobium powder is mixed with an appropriate binder such as camphor, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl acrylic acid ester or polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols, acetic acid esters or water, the mixture is sintered under highly reduced pressure to vaporize and thereby remove the added binder and solvent through evaporation, sublimation or thermal decomposition and the sintered lanthanum-containing niobium lump is cracked, and a method where non-granulated or granulated lanthanum-containing niobium powder is mixed with barium oxide, magnesium oxide or the like and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols, acetic acid esters or water, the mixture is sintered under highly reduced pressure, and the sintered lump is cracked and then dissolved in a solution of acid such as nitric acid or hydrochloric acid or in a solution containing a chelating agent.<br>
The lanthanum-containing niobium powder granulated as such is improved in the press-molding property at the production of a sintered body. The mean particle size of the granulated powder is preferably from 10 to 500 (im. If the mean particle size of the granulated powder is less than 10 |im, partial blocking takes place and the fluidity into a metal mold deteriorates, whereas if it exceeds 500 |am, the molded article after the press-molding is readily broken at the corner parts .  The mean particle size of the granulated powder<br><br>
is more preferably from 30 to 250 |im because a cathode agent can be easily impregnated at the manufacture of a capacitor after sintering the press-molded article.<br>
The lanthanum-containing niobium sintered body for capacitors of the present invention is produced by sintering the above-described lanthanum-containing niobium powder or granulated lanthanum-containing niobium powder. The production method for the sintered body is not particularly limited, however, the sintered body may be obtained, for example, by press-molding the lanthanum-containing niobium powder into a predetermined shape and then heating it at 500 to 2,000°C, preferably from 900 to 1,500°C, more preferably from 900 to 1,300°C, for one minute to ten hours under a pressure of 10"^ to 10^ Pa (pascal) .<br>
In order to more improve the leakage current value of the thus-obtained lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body, a part of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be subjected to nitridation, boronization, carbonization, sulfidation or a plurality of these treatments.<br>
Any of the obtained lanthanum-containing niobium nitride, lanthanum-containing niobium boride, lanthanum-containing niobium carbide and lanthanum-containing niobium sulfide may be contained or two or more thereof may also be contained in combination.<br><br>
The amount bonded thereof, that is, the total content of nitrogen, boron, carbon and sulfur varies depending on the shape of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, however, the total content is more than 0 ppm and not more than 200, 000 ppm, preferably 50 to 100,000 ppm, more preferably from 200 to 20, 000 ppm. If the total content exceeds 200, 000 ppm, the capacitance properties are deteriorated and the fabricated product is not suitable as a capacitor.<br>
The nitridation of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granul-ated powder or sintered body can be performed by any one of liquid nitridation, ion nitridation and gas nitridation or by a combination thereof. Among these, gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere is preferred because the apparatus therefor is simple and the operation is easy. For example, the gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the above-described lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body to stand in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of 100 hours or less, a lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body having an objective nitrided amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing this treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The boronization of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be either gas<br><br>
boronization or solid-phase boronization. For example, the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be boronized by allowing it to stand together with a boron source such as boron pellet or boron halide (e.g., trifluoroboron), at 2,000°C or less for approximately from 1 minute to 100 hours under reduced pressure.<br>
The carbonization of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be any one of gas carbonization, solid-phase carbonization and liquid carbonization. For example, the lanthajium-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be carbonized by allowing it to stand together with a carbon material or a carbon source such as an organic material having carbon (e.g., methane) , at 2,000°C or less under reduced pressure for approximately from 1 minute to 100 hours.<br>
The sulfidation of the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body may be any one of gas sulfidation, ion sulfidation and solid-phase sulfidation. For example, the gas sulfidation in a sulfur gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the lanthanum-containing niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body to stand in a sulfur atmosphere. With an atmosphere temperature of 2, OOO^C or less and a standing time of 100 hours or less, a niobium powder, granulated powder or sintered body having an objective sulfudized amount can be obtained. The treatment<br><br>
time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
(5)Capacitor Device<br>
The manufacture of a capacitor device is described below.<br>
For example, a lead wire comprising a valve-acting metal such as niobium or tantalum and having appropriate shape and length is prepared and this lead wire is integrally molded at the press-molding of the niobium powder such that a part of the lead wire is inserted into the inside of the molded article, whereby the lead wire is designed to work out to a leading line of the sintered body.<br>
Using this sintered body as one of the electrodes, a capacitor can be manufactured by interposing a dielectric material between this one of the electrodes and the other electrode (counter electrode) . The dielectric material used here for the capacitor is preferably a dielectric material mainly comprising niobium oxide. The dielectric material mainly comprising niobium oxide can be obtained, for example, by chemically forming the lanthanum-containing niobium sintered body as one part electrode in an electrolytic solution. For chemically forming the lanthanum-containing niobium electrode in an electrolytic solution, an aqueous protonic acid solution is generally used, such as aqueous 0 .1% phosphoric acid solution or aqueous sulfuric acid solution.<br><br>
or 1% acetic acid solution or aqueous adipic acid solution. In the case of chemically forming the lanthanum-containing niobium electrode in an electrolytic solution to obtain a niobium oxide dielectric material, the capacitor of the present invention is an electrolytic capacitor and the lanthanum-containing niobium electrode serves as an anode.<br>
In the capacitor of the present invention, the other electrode (counter electrode) to the niobium sintered body is not particularly limited and, for example, at least one material (compound) selected from electrolytic solutions, organic semiconductors and inorganic semiconductors known in the art of aluminum electrolytic capacitor, may be used.<br>
Specific examples of the electrolytic solution include a dimethylformamide-ethylene glycol mixed solution having dissolved therein 5% by mass of an isobutyltripropylammonium borotetrafluoride electrolyte, and a propylene carbonate-ethylene glycol mixed solution having dissolved therein 7% by mass of tetraethylammonium borotetrafluoride.<br>
Specific examples of the organic semiconductor include an organic semiconductor comprising a benzenepyrroline tetramer and chloranile, an organic semiconductor mainly comprising tetrathiotetracene, an organic semiconductor mainly comprising tetracyanoquinodimethane, and an electrically conducting polymer comprising a repeating unit represented by formula (1) or (2) :<br><br><br>
wherein R^ to R'* each independently represents a monovalent group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, alkoxy or alkylester group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, a nitro group, a cyano group, a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, a CF3 group, a- phenyl group and a substituted phenyl group; each of the pairs R^ and R% and R^ and R' may combine at an arbitrary position to form a divalent chain for forming at least one 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-membered saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon cyclic structure together with the carbon atoms substituted by R^ and R^ or by R^ and R'*; the cyclic bond chain may contain a bond of carbonyl, ether, ester, amide, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfonyl and imino at an arbitrary position; X represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a nitrogen atom; R^ is present only when X is a nitrogen atom and independently represents hydrogen or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, R^ to R^ of formula (1) or (2) each independently preferably represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl or alkoxy<br><br>
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and each of the pairs R^ and R""', and R^ and R' may combine with each other to form a ring.<br>
In the present invention, the electrically conducting<br>
polymer comprising a repeating unit represented by formula<br>
(1) above is preferably an electrically conducting polymer<br>
comprising a structure unit represented by the following<br>
formula (3) as a repeating unit:<br><br>
wherein R^ and R^ each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a substituent for forming at least one 5-, 6- or 7-membered saturated hydrocarbon cyclic structure containing two oxygen atoms resulting from the alkyl groups combining with each other at an arbitrary position; and the cyclic structure includes a structure having a vinylene bond which may be substituted, and a phenylene structure which may be substituted.<br>

Among these, preferred are polypyrrole, polythiophene and substitution derivatives thereof (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)).<br>
When the organic or inorganic semiconductor used has an electrical conductivity of 10*^ to 10^ S • cm"S the fabricated capacitor can have a smaller impedance value and can be more increased in the capacitance at a high frequency.<br>
The electrically conducting polymer layer is produced, for example, by a method of polymerizing a polymerizable compound comprising aniline, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, methylpyrrole or a substitution derivative thereof under the action of an oxidizing agent capable of undergoing a satisfactory oxidation reaction of dehydrogenating double oxidation. Examples of the polymerization reaction from the polymerizable compound (monomer) include vapor phase polymerization and solution polymerization. The electrically conducting polymer layer is formed on the surface of the niobium sintered body having thereon a dielectric material.  In the case where the electrically<br><br>
conducting polymer is an organic solvent-soluble polymer capable of solution coating, a method of coating the polymer on the surface of the sintered body to form an electrically conducting polymer layer is used.<br>
One preferred example of the production method using the solution polymerization is a method of dipping the niobium sintered body having formed thereon a dielectric layer in a solution containing an oxidizing agent (Solution 1) and subsequently dipping the sintered body in a solution containing a monomer and a dopant (Solution 2) to form an electrically conducting polymer on the surface of the sintered body. Also, the sintered body may be dipped in Solution 1 after it is dipped in Solution 2. Solution 2 used in the above-described method may be a monomer solution not containing a dopant. In the case of using a dopant, a solution containing an oxidizing agent may be allowed to be present together on use of the dopant.<br>
Such an operation in the polymerization step is repeated once or more, preferably from 3 to 20 times, per the niobium sintered body having thereon a dielectric material, whereby a dense and stratified electrically conducting polymer layer can be easily formed.<br>
In the production method of a capacitor according to the present invention, any oxidizing agent may be used insofar as it does not adversely affect the capacitor performance and the reductant of the oxidizing agent can work out to a dopant<br><br>
and elevate the electrically conductivity of the electrically conducting polymer. An industrially inexpensive compound facilitated in the handling at the production is preferred.<br>
