DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0029] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the transmission of the present invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary gear sets. These mechanical connections generically link or relate transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first component or element of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a ground or a transmission housing. A second<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
component or element of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of a second planetary gear set. The second component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of the third planetary gear set. A third component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third component or element of the third planetary gear set. Finally, the third component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool In Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0031] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0032] The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to ground, a stationary element or the transmission housing 50. The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the input shaft or member 12 and to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. The third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 is coupled to the output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0033] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the third node 14C of the first<br>

planetary gear set 14 to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. Fourth clutch 32 selectively connects first node ISA of the third planetary gear set 18 to second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A brake 34 selectively connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 to the ground, stationary element or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear carriers.<br>
[0035] For example, the first planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear member 14B, a planet gear carrier member 14C and a ring gear member 14A, Sun gear member 14B is connected for common rotation with a first interconnecting shaft or member 46. Ring gear member 14A is connected to the ground or transmission housing 50 by a second interconnecting shaft or member 48 in order to restrict rotation of ring gear member 14A relative to the ground or transmission housing 50. The planet gear carrier member 14C rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one shown) and is connected for common rotation with a third interconnecting shaft or member 52 and with a fourth<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 54. Planet gears 14D are configured to intermesh with sun gear member 14B and ring gear member 14A.<br>
[0036] The Input shaft or member 12 Is preferably continuously connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected with a final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0037] The second planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16A, a planet carrier member 16C that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D and a ring gear member 16B. Planet gears 16D are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 16A and ring gear member 16B. Sun gear member 16A is connected for common rotation with a fifth interconnecting shaft or member 56. Planet carrier member 16C is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12. Ring gear member 168 is connected for common rotation with the first interconnecting shaft or member 46 and with a sixth interconnecting shaft or member 58.<br>
[0038] The third planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18B, a ring gear member 18A and a planet carrier member 18C that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D. Planet gears 18D are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 18B and ring gear member 18A. Sun gear member 18B is connected for common rotation with sixth interconnecting shaft or member 58. Ring gear member 18A is connected for common rotation with a seventh interconnecting shaft or member 60. Planet carrier member 18C is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
[0039] The fourth planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20C, a ring gear member 20A and a planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 20D. Planet gears 20D are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 20C and ring gear member 20A. Sun gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12. Ring gear member 20A is connected for common rotation with output shaft or member 22. Planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with an eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62.<br>
[0040] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32 and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example, first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect third interconnecting shaft or member 52 to fifth interconnecting shaft or member 56. Second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect fourth interconnecting shaft or member 54 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62. Third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect sixth interconnecting shaft or member 58 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62. Fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect seventh interconnecting shaft or member 60 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62. Brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect fifth interconnecting shaft or member 56 to transmission housing 50 in order to restrict rotation of sun gear member 16A relative to transmission housing 50.<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and brake 34), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0042] To establish reverse gear, second clutch 28 and third clutch 30 are engaged or activated. Second clutch 28 connects fourth interconnecting shaft or member 54 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62. Third clutch 30 connects sixth interconnecting shaft or member 58 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0043] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001252-PTT-DLT<br>
the clutches and the brake not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0044] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
