FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6" enoic acid calcium of Formula I,<br>
 <br>
The present invention is an improvement in or modification of the invention disclosed and claimed in our co-pending application no 277/CHE/2007,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rosuvastatin, which is an antihyperchlolesterolemic drug, is chemically known as (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium (2:1) salt of Formula I.<br>
 <br>
Rosuvastatin was for the first time disclosed in US 5,260,440. Rosuvastatin is being marketed under the proprietary name CRESTOR, as an oral tablet, for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.<br>
In view of the importance of rosuvastatin as a lipid-lowering agent, several synthetic methods have been reported in the literature to prepare rosuvastatin, some of which are summarized below:<br>
US 5,260,440 disclose a process for preparing rosuvastatin in examples. The process is as shown below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
The difficulties in the above process are that the intermediate (A) is not obtained in pure form readily. Further, its purification is tedious and overall yield is extremely low. Even when intermediate (A) is obtained in pure form, further condensation with intermediate (11) to form rosuvastatin, does not result in rosuvastatin of right quality as the product contains unacceptable quantity of impurity levels.<br>
WO 03/097614 A2 describes a modified procedure for the preparation of the starting material 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-carboxaldehyde and its further conversion to rosuvastatin by condensing with methyl (3R)-3-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-5-oxo-6-triphenylphosphoranylidene hexanoate. The condensed product was deprotected using methanesulfonic acid and subsequently converted to rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt.<br>
WO 2004/052867 Al describes a process to prepare rosuvastatin by condensing 1-cyano (2S)-<br>
2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-4-oxo-5-triphenylphosphoranylidenepentane with 4-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-carbaldehyde	and<br>
subsequent deprotection of silyl group, followed by reduction and hydrolysis.<br>
WO 2000/049014 Al discloses a novel chemical process for the manufacture of tert-butyl (E)-(6-{2-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl]vinyl}-(4R,6S)-2,2-dimethyl[l,3]dioxan-4-yl)acetate, which comprises reaction of diphenyl {4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl-methyl}phosphineoxide     with     tert-butyl     2-[(4R,6S)-6-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-4-yljacetate and its further conversion to rosuvastatin.<br>
WO 2004/014872 Al describes a process for the manufacture of rosuvastatin calcium (2:1) salt, which comprises mixing a solution of calcium chloride with a solution of water soluble salt of (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid. This process for the preparation of rosuvastatin employs the use of phosphorane side chain, the preparation of side chain requires eight<br>
 <br>
synthetic steps and involves expensive reagents. The process is both uneconomical and time consuming, hence not appropriate for commercial scale operation.<br>
WO 2006/100689 Al discloses a process for preparation of rosuvastatin as shown below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the above scheme R1, R2, R3 represent substituted or unsubstituted phenyl and R4 represents an aliphatic residue selected from C1-C4 alkyl, R5 represents C1-C4 alkyl which is optionally<br>
 <br>
substituted by hydroxyl, R6 represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy, R7 represents aliphatic residue, R8 represents C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
WO 2006/106526 Al describes the preparation of rosuvastatin as shown below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the above mentioned scheme R1, R2, R3 are substituted or unsubstituted phenyl and R4 is an aliphatic residue selected from C1-C4 alkyl, R5 represents C1-C4 alkyl, M is an alkali metal salt,<br>
 <br>
X represents a halogen, R6 represents C1-C4 alkyl which is optionally substituted by hydroxyl, R7 represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy, R8 is an aliphatic residue selected from C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
As mentioned above though there are a number of processes available still there is a continuing need to identify alternative processes for the manufacture of rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such processes may, for example, when compared to previously known processes, be more convenient to use, be more suitable for large scale manufacture, give the product in a better yield, reduce the number of steps involved, use intermediates which are more easily isolated, require less complex purification techniques, use less expensive reagents and/or be more environmentally friendly.<br>
We have now found an improved process for preparing (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-<br>
2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept"6-enoic	acid<br>
calcium of Formula I<br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium with high yield and high purity.<br>
In yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium, which is simple, industrially applicable and economically viable.<br>

 <br>
resulting compound of Formula VIII is extracted into an organic solvent. The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude compound of Formula VIII, which is purified or used as such for hydrolysis.<br>
Saponification of compound of Formula VIII is carried out using a base, such as alkali metal hydroxide selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide. Preferably sodium hydroxide is used. The sodium salt of rosuvastatin thus obtained can be optionally isolated or the solution containing of rosuvastatin sodium is treated with benzathine acetate to get the corresponding benzathine salt, which can be further converted to rosuvastatin calcium. Alternatively, aqueous sodium salt of rosuvastatin can be treated with calcium ion source to give rosuvastatin calcium.<br>
