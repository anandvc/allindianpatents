Herbicidal activities of the compounds according to the present invention and the known standard compounds as represented in the following Table 2 were estimated in a greenhouse.<br><br>
(Table Removed)25 Test for herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy Field<br>
Pots having a surface area of 150cm2 were filled with a small amount of fertilizer and sterilized paddy field soil in a muddy state with a depth of 5cm.     Five (5) seeds of pre-germinated rice were directly sown on the soil surface and three (3) rice seedlings (2-3 leaves) prepared in advance were transplanted in a depth of 2cm in each pot      In another pot, seeds of barnyardgrass were sown and incorporated into the surface layer of soil After sowing and transplanting of rice plant and sowing of barnyardgrass, the pots were flooded wjth water 3cm deep and kept in a greenhouse.     The rice plant was treated with the chemicals 5 days after sowing or transplanting, and barnyardgrass was treated with the chemicals at the pre-emergence (5 days after from sowing) and post-emergence stage (at the three-leaf stage, usually after 15 days from sowing).<br>
Suitable herbicidal compositions were prepared by mixing and dissolving 1 part by weight of the active compound with 5 parts by weight of acetone and 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycolether as an cmulsificr and then diluting with water to the predetermined concentration. Application was made by dropping the herbicide solutions onto the water surface of the pots.<br>
The test plants were observed for two weeks after the treatment with the chemicals and then herbicida] activity and phytotoxicity of the test compounds were visually rated in a percent (%) scale, where 0 means no activity or phytotoxicity and 100 means complete death.<br>
The herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy field of the compound of formula (1) and the known standard compounds are given in the following Tables 3a and 3b, respectively.<br>
Among the compounds, the standard compound E is Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, which is the most widely used herbicide in rice at the present time.    The standard compounds A,<br><br>
, C and D have similar structure to the compound of formula (I) of the present invention, and were filed already.<br>
i<br>
[Table 3 a]<br>
Herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the standard compounds in a paddy condition.(Table Removed)<br>
 As shown in Table 3a, the standard compound E, at 80 g/ha which is the four-times higher rate than the conventional application rate (20 g/ha), shows little phytotoxicity to rice; 10 or 30% to the transplanted or direct-seeded rice, respectively. Therefore, the compound E is considered to be highly safe to rice. However, it shows weak herbicidal activity to barnyardgrass (10% at 20g/ha), which is the most important weed in rice.<br>
On the contrary, the standard compounds A to D show excellent activity to barnyardgrass, i.e., 95% or greater activity at 20g/ha by pre- or post-emergence treatments. These compounds (A~D) also show rice safety at 20 g/ha; 10 to 40% of phytotoxicity27<br>
depending on the compounds However, for commercial development, a compound should be safe at four-times higher rates than the recommended rate. The compounds A~D show 50-80% of phytotoxicity depending on the compounds at 80g/ha, which is four times as much as the typical dose, and thus, are considered to be impossible to develop commercially.<br>
[Table 3b]<br>
Herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the compounds of the present invention in a paddy<br>
condition.(Table Removed) <br>
The compounds of the present invention have excellent herbicidal activity to barnyardgrass as well as improved rice selectivity. As shown in Table 3b, the compounds of the present invention have excellent herbicidal activity against barnyardgrass; 90% or greater depending on the compounds at 20g/ha. Further, they show acceptable rice safety at 80g/ha (30% or less), which is comparable to the standard compound E.<br>
Weed spectrum in paddy Field<br>
Pots having a surface area of 500Cm2 were filled with the soil in a muddy state as mentioned above. Seeds of annual weeds such as Monochoria vaginaiis (MOOVA), Lindernia proatmbens (LIDPR), Rotala indica (ROTIN), Scirpus juncoides (SCPJU), etc were sown on the surface layer of soil, and then were planted tubers of perennial weeds such as Cyperus serotinus (CYPSE) and Sagittaria pygmaea (SAGPY) in a depth of 1cm, and Eleocharis kuroguwai (ELOKU) and Sagittaria trifolia (SAGTR) in a depth of 4cni. After 5 days, the chemicals were formulated as mentioned above and applied by dropping to the water surface of the pots. The test plants were observed for two weeks after the treatment and the results are given in the following Table 4.<br>
[Table 4] .(Table Removed)<br>
Weed spectrum of the compounds of the present invention in a paddy condition.) From the results of Table 4, the compounds of the present invention show high activities on various annual and perennial weeds in addition to barnyardgrass.<br>
Consequently, the compounds of the present invention, novel herbicidal molecules in paddy conditions, effectively control the annual and perennial weeds including barnyardgrass by pre- .and post-emergence treatment and provide a high level of safety to transplanted and direct-seeded rice. Therefore, they are expected to be used for such<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
