				<td>Technical.Field<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode<br>
including an aliphatic nitrile compound. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an<br>
electrode whose surface is coated with an aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound or which comprises an electrode active<br>
material comprising an aliphatic nitrile compound, as<br>
well as to a lithium secondary battery having the same<br>
electrode.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a<br>
lithium salt such as LiPFs and a carbonate solvent reacts<br>
continuously with the surface of a cathode active<br>
material (particularly, LiCoO2) . during repeated<br>
charge/discharge cycles, resulting in the continuous<br>
formation of a resistance layer that causes an increase<br>
in resistance and interrupts conduction: of. Li+ ions Such<br>
resistance layer causes the active material particles to<br>
be isolated among themselves or from a current collector'<br>
(Al foil), thereby detracting from battery performance<br>
and life characteristics. Further, such problems<br>
increasingly and predominantly . occur at a high<br>
temperature to accelerate side reactions between an<br>
electrolyte and the surface of a cathode when a battery<br>
is stored at a high temperature (45°C or 60oC) for a long<br>
time, resulting in a significant decrease in the<br>
lifetime of a battery.<br>
Meanwhile, non-aqueous electrolyte-based secondary<br>
batteries have problems related with safety upon<br>
overcharge for the following reasons. Cathode active<br>
materials such as lithium and/or lithium ion-containing<br>
metal oxides capable of lithium' ion intercalation/<br>
deintercalation are converted into thermally unstable<br>
substances due to the release of lithium during<br>
overcharge. When the temperature of a battery reaches<br>
the critical temperature, oxygen is liberated from such<br>
unstable substances and the free oxygen may react with<br>
the solvent of an electrolyte, etc., through a highly<br>
exothermic reaction mechanism. Therefore, such a series<br>
of exothermal reactions by heating results in thermal<br>
runaway.<br>
Generally, factors affecting the safety of a<br>
battery include: (1) heat emission due to oxidation of<br>
electrolytes; and (2) heat emission resulting from the<br>
structural collapse of a cathode due to overcharge. When<br>
overcharge proceeds, heat emission occurring from the<br>
above factors independently or simultaneously causes an<br>
increase in the internal temperature of a battery,<br>
followed by ignition or explosion of the battery. Thus,<br>
batteries show a safety problem upon overcharge.<br>
Meanwhile, when external physical impacts (for<br>
example, exposure to high temperature such as a<br>
temperature of 150°C or higher by heating) are applied to<br>
a battery while the battery is charged or overcharged,<br>
the battery is overheated due to the heat emission<br>
caused by the reaction of an inflammable electrolyte<br>
with a cathode active material, and the structure of an<br>
electrode (particularly, a cathode) is collapsed to<br>
generate oxygen, which accelerates the combustion of the<br>
electrolyte. Therefore, a separator disposed between a<br>
cathode and an anode is melted and the electrical energy<br>
induces thermal runaway, resulting in ignition and<br>
explosion of the battery.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found that an aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound that forms a strong bond with a<br>
 transition metal or transition metal oxide in an<br>
 electrode active material can improve the safety of a<br>
battery, when the battery is overcharged and/or<br>
subjected to physical impacts applied from the exterior<br>
of the battery (for example, exposure to high<br>
temperature by heating) . Meanwhile, we have also<br>
recognized a problem in that when an aliphatic dinitrile<br>
compound is used as an additive for electrolyte, there<br>
is an increase in viscosity of the electrolyte so that<br>
diffusion of Li ions cannot be made smoothly under<br>
extreme conditions (a low temperature of between -20oC<br>
and -10°C), resulting in degradation of battery<br>
performance, at a low temperature.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in<br>
view of the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of<br>
the present invention to improve the safety of a battery<br>
with no degradation of battery performance by<br>
incorporating an aliphatic dinitrile compound uniformly<br>
into an electrode so that the aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
can contribute only to the formation of a complex with<br>
an electrode active material.<br>
According to an. aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided an electrode comprising an aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound, preferably a compound represented by<br>
the following formula 1, whose surface is coated with<br>
 the aliphatic nitrile compound or which comprises an<br>
electrode active material comprising the aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound. According to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary<br>
battery having the above-described electrode.<br><br>
wherein R is a C2-C15 alkane.<br>
Preferably, the aliphatic nitrile compound,<br>
preferably the compound represented by formula 1 is<br>
coated uniformly on the surface of an electrode active<br>
 material in an electrode.<br>
Additionally, it is preferable that the electrode<br>
according to the present invention includes a complex<br>
formed between the surface of the electrode active<br>
material and the aliphatic nitrile compound.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
explained in more detail.<br>
According to the present invention, the electrode<br>
for a lithium secondary battery is characterized by<br>
comprising an aliphatic nitrile compound, preferably the<br>
compound represented by the above formula 1.<br>
Aliphatic nitrile compounds can form a strong bond<br>
with a transition metal or transition metal oxide such<br>
as cobalt exposed to the surface of an electrode active<br>
material through their cyano functional groups having<br>
high dipole moment. Particularly, the cyano functional<br>
groups can form a stronger complex on the surface of an<br>
electrode active material at a temperature of 45°C or<br>
higher (see, FIG. 1).<br>
An electrode coated with an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound has a -strong protection surface that protects<br>
the surface of electrode from side reactions with an<br>
electrolyte. Therefore, it is possible to accomplish<br>
efficient lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation<br>
without varying viscosity of the electrolyte and ion<br>
conductivity, and to prevent the formation of a<br>
resistance layer capable of detracting from battery<br>
performance by the reaction of the electrolyte with<br>
electrode during repeated charge/discharge cycles, on<br>
the surface of electrode. As a result, it is possible to<br>
maintain battery performance. Further, according to the<br>
present invention, a lithium secondary battery having an<br>
electrode uniformly coated with an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound on the surface of an electrode active material,<br>
and preferably comprising an aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
forming a strong complex with a transition metal and/or<br>
 transition metal oxide present on the surface of<br>
electrode active material, can stabilize the transition<br>
metal and transition metal oxide to prevent a partial<br>
release of the transition metal from the electrode<br>
active material during repeated charge/discharge cycles.<br>
In addition, when external physical impacts are applied<br>
to a battery (particularly, when a battery is exposed to<br>
high temperature such as a temperature of 150°C or<br>
higher), it is possible to efficiently inhibit an<br>
exothermic reaction caused by the reaction of an<br>
electrolyte directly with the electrode surface and to<br>
retard the structural collapse of the electrode active<br>
material, thereby preventing ignition and explosion<br>
resulting from an increase in temperature inside of the<br>
battery. More particularly, because aliphatic nitrile<br>
compounds can protect the electrode surface more<br>
strongly at a high temperature of 45°C or higher than<br>
room temperature, it is possible to provide thermally<br>
stable electrodes.<br>
Although the compound represented by the above<br>
formula 1 is exemplified as an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound that can be incorporated into an electrode<br>
according to the. present invention, another aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound having a nitrile group only at one<br>
side, compared to the compound represented by formula 1,<br>
has a great possibility for providing safety and/or<br>
battery performance in such a degree as to be equivalent<br>
to the compound represented by formula 1, and thus it is<br>
also included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Meanwhile, alkanes present in the compound<br>
 represented by formula 1 have no reactivity. Therefore,<br>
when the compound represented by formula 1 is<br>
incorporated into an electrode, a possibility for an<br>
irreversible reaction is low. As a result, addition of<br>
the compound represented by formula 1 does not cause<br>
 degradation in battery performance.<br>
 Because an aromatic nitrile compound decomposes at<br><br>
an anode during the initial charge cycle (during<br>
formation) to increase irreversible capacity and to<br>
degrade battery performance significantly, it is not<br>
preferable to incorporate an aromatic nitrile compound<br>
into an electrode and to coat an electrode with an<br>
aromatic nitrile compound.<br>
Particular examples of the compound represented by<br>
formula 1 include succinonitrile (R=C2H4) , glutaronitrile<br>
(R=C3H6) , adiponitrile (R=C4H8) , pimelonitrile (R=C5H10),<br>
octanedinitrile (R=C6H12), azelonitrile (R=C7H14),<br>
sebaconitrile (R=CbH16), 1, 9-dicyanononane (R=C9H18) ,<br>
dodecanedinitrile (R=C10H20), etc., but are not limited<br>
thereto.<br>
Particularly,. succinonitrile forms the strongest<br>
protection layer among the compounds represented by<br>
formula 1. The longer the allcane is, the weaker the<br>
protection layer to be formed becomes. Therefore, it is<br>
most preferable to use succinonitrile as a coating<br>
material among the above compounds.<br>
The aliphatic nitrile compound is present in an<br>
electrode preferably in an amount of 0.1-20 wt% based on<br>
the weight of electrolyte or 1-10 wt% based on the<br>
weight of active material, more preferably in an amount<br>
of 10 wt% or less based on the weight of electrolyte or<br>
5 wt% or less based on the weight of active material,<br>
and most preferably in an amount of 5 wt% or less based<br>
on the weight of electrolyte or 2.5 wt% or less based.on<br>
the weight of active material.<br>
In order to incorporate an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound into an electrode, a coating solution<br>
containing an aliphatic nitrile compound may be applied<br>
on an electrode. Otherwise, an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound may be added to slurry for electrode active<br>
material to form an electrode.<br>
For the purpose that the nitrile compound<br>
 participates only in complex formation with a transition<br>
metal oxide of an electrode active material, a coating<br>
solution containing an aliphatic nitrile compound is<br>
applied to an electrode or an aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
is added to electrode active material-containing slurry<br>
in an adequate amount. Preferably, the electrode or<br>
slurry comprising the nitrile compound is treated at a<br>
high temperature. Then, the surface of electrode, namely<br>
the surface of electrode active material can be<br>
protected uniformly with the aliphatic nitrile compound.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned high-temperature<br>
treatment applied to an electrode or slurry, a battery<br>
may be preferably treated at a high temperature after<br>
the assemblage thereof.<br>
The aliphatic nitrile compound is dispersed or<br>
dissolved into a solvent to provide a solution, the<br>
solution is coated on the surface of an electrode and<br>
then the solvent is dried in order to coat the electrode<br>
surface, preferably the surface of electrode active<br>
material with the aliphatic nitrile compound. The<br>
coating method may include dip coating, spray coating,<br>
or the like. -<br>
There is no particular limitation in selection of<br>
the solvent for use in the coating solution containing<br>
an aliphatic nitrile compound, as long as the solvent<br>
has good compatibility. It is preferable to use, as a<br>
solvent for coating solution, non-polar solvents such as<br>
THF (tetrahydrofuran) and polar solvents such as NMP (N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrollidone) and carbonate solvents used as a<br>
solvent for electrolyte. Although the amount of<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound varies with the amount to be<br>
coated on an electrode, the aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
may be used in the range of between 1:9 and 9:1,<br>
expressed in the weight ratio to the solvent.<br>
The method for forming an electrode by adding an<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound to slurry for electrode<br>
active material includes the steps of: mixing an<br><br>
aliphatic nitrile compound with an electrode active<br>
material and other additives such as a binder and<br>
conductive agent, as necessary, to form slurry for<br>
electrode active material; applying the slurry for<br>
electrode active material on a collector; and removing<br>
the solvent used in the slurry by drying, etc.<br>
In order to apply the slurry for electrode active<br>
material, die coating, roll coating, comma coating and<br>
combinations thereof may be used.<br>
Meanwhile, because the compound represented by<br>
formula 1 starts to be slightly volatilized at a high<br>
temperature of 100°C or higher and then be substantially<br>
evaporated without leaving residues at a temperature of<br>
about 150°C, it is necessary to maintain an adequate<br>
drying temperature, drying rate and vent flow for the<br>
purpose of coating an electrode smoothly with the<br>
compound represented by formula 1 from slurry containing<br>
NMP as a solvent.<br>
To prevent the compound represented by formula 1<br>
from being volatilized and to remove residual NMP, the<br>
drying temperature preferably ranges from 90oC to 110°C.<br>
The drying rate is preferably 3 m/min or less, more<br>
preferably 2 m/min or less, but may be varied with the<br>
length of a drying furnace and the drying temperature of<br>
slurry. The vent flow is preferably 2000-3000 rpm.<br>
More particularly, when the electrode comprising<br>
the compound represented by formula 1 is dried at an<br>
excessively low temperature in order to retain the<br>
compound in the electrode, NMP content and water content<br>
in the electrode increase, thereby causing a problem in<br>
that battery performance is degraded. On the other hand,<br>
when the electrode is dried at an excessively high<br>
temperature, NMP content in the electrode decreases but<br>
the compound represented by formula 1 is substantially<br>
volatilized, and thus it is not possible to obtain a<br>
 uniformly coated electrode. Therefore, it is important<br>
that the drying temperature, drying rate and vent flow<br>
are maintained within the above ranges.<br>
Meanwhile, it is preferable that aliphatic nitrile<br>
compounds form a complex with the surface of an<br>
electrode active material. Preferably, for the purpose '<br>
of forming a complex, an electrode comprising an<br>
electrode active material whose surface is coated with<br>
an aliphatic nitrile compound is further treated at a<br>
high temperature. Particularly, the high-temperature<br>
treatment may be performed at such a temperature range<br>
as not to affect the electrode active material and<br>
binder, generally at a temperature of 180°C or lower.<br>
Otherwise, although the high-temperature treatment<br>
varies with the kind of the aliphatic nitrile compound,<br>
it may be performed at such a temperature range as to<br>
prevent evaporation of the aliphatic nitrile compound,<br>
generally at a temperature of 120°C or lower. In general,<br>
the high-temperature treatment is suitably performed at<br>
a temperature of between 60°C and 90oC. Long-time storage<br>
at a temperature of between 30°C and 40°C may result in<br>
the same effect.<br>
As a cathode active material for use in<br>
electrodes, lithium-containing transition metal oxides<br>
may be used. The cathode active material can be at least<br>
one selected from the group consisting of LiCo02, LiNiO2,<br>
LiMn2O4, LiMn02 and LiNi1-xCox02 (wherein 0<x></x>
Meanwhile, as an anode active material for use in<br>
electrodes, carbon, lithium metal or lithium alloy may<br>
be used. In addition, other metal oxides capable of<br>
 lithium intercalation/deintercalation and having an<br>
electric potential of 2V or less based on lithium (for<br>
example, TiO2 and SnO2) may be used as an anode active<br>
material.<br>
Slurry for electrodes may further comprise a<br>
 binder, conductive agent, viscosity controller,<br>
 supplementary binder, etc., in addition to active<br><br>
materials.<br>
Any conventional collectors made of conductive<br>
materials can be used with no particular limitation.<br>
More particularly, collectors made of metals such as<br>
iron, copper, aluminum and nickel are widely used.<br>
A lithium secondary battery, to which the<br>
electrode comprising an aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
according to the present invention may be applied, can<br>
comprise:<br>
(1) a cathode capable of lithium ion<br>
intercalation/deintercalation;<br>
(2) an anode capable of lithium ion<br>
intercalation/deintercalation;<br>
(3) a porous separator; and<br>
(4) a) a lithium salt; and<br>
b) an electrolyte compound.<br>
Non-aqueous electrolytes for lithium secondary<br>
batteries generally include flammable non-aqueous<br>
organic solvents including cyclic carbonates and/or<br>
linear carbonates. Particular examples 'of cyclic<br>
carbonates " that may be used in the present- invention<br>
include ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate<br>
(PC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), etc. Typical examples<br>
of linear carbonates include diethyl carbonate (DEC),<br>
dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC).<br>
When the electrode comprising an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound according to the present invention is used, it<br>
is possible to inhibit thermal runaway and to improve<br>
safety of batteries without causing degradation in<br>
battery performance even if such conventional flammable<br>
non-aqueous organic solvents are used as electrolytes.<br>
Non-aqueous electrolytes comprise lithium salts<br>
such as LiClO4, LiCF3SO3, LiPF6, LiBF4, LiAsF6,<br>
LiN(CF3SO2)2, etc.<br>
The lithium secondary battery according to the<br>
present invention may have a cylindrical, prismatic or<br>
pouch-like shape.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is to<br>
be understood that the following examples are<br>
illustrative only and the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto.<br>
[EXAMPLES]<br>
Example 1<br>
Succinonitrile was diluted with acetone as a<br>
solvent in the weight ratio of 3:7 to provide a<br>
solution, into which a cathode was dipped. Then, the<br>
cathode was high-temperature treated at 30°C for 2 days<br>
to evaporate the solvent, thereby providing a cathode<br>
 comprising succinocitrile forming a complex with the<br>
surface of cathode active material. The cathode active<br>
material was L1C0O2. Artificial graphite was used as an<br>
anode active material. The electrolyte used in this<br>
example was 1M LiPF6 solution formed of EC: PC:DEC=3:2:5.<br>
A 383562-type lithium polymer battery was manufactured<br>
by using a conventional method and the battery was<br>
packed with an aluminum laminate packaging material to<br>
provide a battery pack. Next, the battery was aged by<br>
treating it again at a high temperature of 60°C for 12<br>
hours or more so that any unreacted and/or residual<br>
succinonitrile in the electrode can form a complex.<br>

Example 1 was repeated to provide lithium polymer<br>
batteries, except that glutaronitrile (R=C3H6) (Example<br>
2), adiponitrile (R=C4H8) (Example 3), pimelonitrile<br>
(R=C5H10) (Example 4) , octanedinitrile (R=C6H12) (Example<br>
5), azelonitrile (R=C7H14) (Example 6), sebaconitrile<br>
(R=C8H16) (Example 7) and dodecanedinitrile (R=C10H20)<br>
(Example 8) were used, instead of succinonitrile<br>
(R=C2H4).<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium<br>
polymer battery, except that the cathode was not dipped<br>
into the aliphatic nitrile compound-containing solution.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
1M LiPFs solution formed of EC:EMC=1:2 was used as<br>
an electrolyte, to which 3 wt% of succinonitrile (R=C2H4)<br>
was added. Artificial graphite and LiCo02 were used as an<br>
anode active material and cathode active material,<br>
respectively, to provide a 523450-type prismatic lithium<br>
 battery according to a conventional method. Next, the<br>
battery was aged at a high temperature of 60oC for 12<br>
hours or more.<br>
Example 9<br>
A cathode was dipped into a solution containing<br>
 succinonitrile (R=C2H4) in a acetone as a solvent, and<br>
 then was high-temperature treated at 30 C for 2 days to<br><br>
evaporate the solvent, thereby providing a cathode<br>
comprising 3-5 wt% of succinocitrile, based on the<br>
weight of electrolyte, forming a complex with the<br>
surface of cathode active material. The cathode active<br>
material was LiCo02. The electrolyte used in this example<br>
was 1M LiPF6 solution formed of EC:EMC=1:2. Artificial<br>
graphite was used as an anode active material. A 523450-<br>
type prismatic lithium battery was manufactured by using<br>
a conventional method. Next, the battery was aged by<br>
treating it again at a high temperature of 60°C for 12<br>
hours or more so that any unreacted and/or residual<br>
succinonitrile in the electrode can form a complex.<br>
Comparative Examples 3-10<br>
The electrolyte used in these examples was 1M LiPF6<br>
solution formed of EC:EMC=1:2. To the above electrolyte,<br>
succinonitrilte (R-C2H4) (Comparative Example 3),<br>
glutaronitrile (R=C3H6) (Comparative Example 4),<br>
adiponitrile (R=C4H8) (Comparative Example 5),<br>
pimelonitrile (R=C5H10) (Comparative Example 6) ,<br>
octanedinitrile (R=C6H12) (Comparative Example 7),<br>
azelonitrile (R=C7H14) (Comparative Example 8),<br>
sebaconitrile (R=C8H16) (Comparative Example 9) and<br>
dodecanedinitrile' (R=C10H20) (Comparative Example 10) were<br>
added, each in the amount of 3 wt%. Artificial graphite<br>
 and LiCoO2 were used as an anode active material and<br>
cathode active material, respectively. 383562 type<br>
lithium polymer batteries were manufactured by using a<br>
conventional method and the batteries were packed with<br>
aluminum laminate packaging materials to provide battery<br>
 packs. Next, the batteries were aged at a high<br>
temperature of 60oC for 12 hours or more.<br>
Examples 10-17<br>
Cathodes were dipped into solutions, each<br>
containing succinonitrile (R=C2H4) (Example 10),<br>
 glutaronitrile (R=C3H6) (Example 11), adiponitrile<br>
 (R=C4H8) (Example 12), pimelonitrile (R=C5H10) (Example<br>
13), octanedinitrile (R=C6H12) {Example 14), azelonitrile<br>
(R=C7H14) (Example 15), sebaconitrile (R=C8H16) (Example<br>
16) and dodecanedinitrile (R=C10H20) (Example 17) . Then<br>
each cathode was high-temperature treated at 30°C for 2<br>
days to evaporate the solvent, thereby providing a<br>
cathode whose surface was coated with 3-5 wt% of each<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound (based on the weight of<br>
electrolyte). The cathode active material was LiCo02.<br>
The electrolyte used in these examples was 1M LiPF6<br>
solut ion formed of EC:EMC—1:2. Artificial graphite was<br>
used as an anode active material. 383562 type lithium<br>
polymer batteries were manufactured by using a<br>
conventional method and the batteries were packed with<br>
aluminum laminate packaging materials to provide battery<br>
packs. Next, the batteries were aged at a high<br>
temperature of 60°C for 12 hours or more.<br>
Example 18<br>
To cathode slurry containing LiCoO2 as a cathode<br>
active material, Super-p as a conductive agent, PVDF<br>
 homopolymer. as a binder and NMP as a solvent, 5. wt% of<br>
succinonitrile based on the weight of electrolyte (2.5<br>
wt% of succinonitrile based on the weight of cathode<br>
active material) was added and then stirred. The mixed<br>
slurry was applied on a collector and vacuum dried at<br>
 about 100 °C for 24 hours or more so as to prevent the<br>
evaporation of succinonitrile at the highest degree and<br>
to remove residual NMP. Further, the drying rate (2<br>
m/min) and vent flow (2100 rpm) were dropped as low as<br>
possible so that the slurry can be coated smoothly on<br>
 the current collector. By doing so, a cathode that<br>
comprises succinonitrile forming a complex with the<br>
surface of cathode active material and is coated<br>
uniformly with succinocitrile was obtained.<br>
Artificial graphite was used as an anode active<br>
 material. 1M LiPFs solution formed of EC:PC:DEC=3:2:5 was<br>
 used as an electrolyte, to which lwt% of VC was added. A<br>
323456-type lithium polymer battery was manufactured by<br>
using a conventional method and the battery was packed<br>
with an aluminum laminate packaging material to provide<br>
a battery pack. Next, the battery was aged by treating<br>
 it again at a high temperature of 60°C for 12 hours or<br>
more so that any unreacted and/or residual<br>
succinonitrile in the electrode can form a complex.<br>
Comparative Example 11<br>
Example 18 was repeated to provide a lithium<br>
polymer battery, except that no aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound was added to the cathode slurry.<br>
[Experimental Results]<br>
1. Test for formation of ligands on cathode<br>
surface<br>
Each battery obtained from Example 1 and<br>
Comparative Example 1 was fully charged to 4.2V and each<br>
cathode was separated from each battery to prepare a<br>
sample of 1 cm X 1 cm size. Additionally, each sample was<br>
cleaned with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to remove<br>
impurities remaining on the surface and then was tested<br>
for checking the formation of ligands by using a general<br>
surface analyzing apparatus based on XPS (X-ray<br>
photoelectron spectroscopy). The XPS apparatus (ESCALAB<br>
250) used in this test is one that shows constitutional<br>
 elements forming a surface by detecting specific binding<br>
energy and kinetic energy of atoms and reading atomic<br>
information to the depth of several nanometers from the<br>
surface. Complex formation for the electrode comprising<br>
a nitrile compound was checked through a peak<br>
 corresponding to the formation of nitrogen atoms. As<br>
shown in FIG. 1, nitrogen atoms were not detected on the<br>
 surface of cathode in the case of the battery<br>
(Comparative Example 1) using no succinonitrile. On the<br>
Other hand, in the case of the battery (Example 1) using<br>
 succinonitrile, nitrogen atoms were clearly detected by<br>
the presence of a strong bond formed between<br>
succinonitrile and cobalt transition metal or metal<br>
oxide in the cathode active material. The above XPS<br>
results indicate that a cyano functional group was<br>
bonded to cobalt metal or metal oxide to form a complex<br>
on the surface.<br>
From the result, it could be expected that an<br>
aliphatic nitrile additive could form a strong complex<br>
with the surface of cathode active material, thereby<br>
inhibiting side reactions generated from the battery<br>
during repeated charge/discharge cycles.<br>
2. Test for heat emission control<br>
Each battery obtained from Examples 1-8 and<br>
Comparative Example 1 was charged to 4.2V. A general<br>
thermogravimetric analyzer, DSC (Differential Scanning<br>
Calorimeter) was used, wherein two high-pressure pans<br>
resistant to vapor pressure of the electrolyte were used<br>
as pans for measurement. To one pan, about 5-10 mg of<br>
the cathode sample separated from each of the batteries<br>
according to Examples 1-8 and Comparative Example 1 was<br>
introduced, while the other pan was left empty.<br>
Calorific difference between two pans was analyzed while<br>
the pans were heated at a rate of 5°C/min to 350°C to<br>
measure temperature peaks where heat emission occurs.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the battery (Comparative<br>
Example 1) using the electrode comprising no aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound shows heat emission peaks at about 200°C<br>
and 240°C . The peak at about 200°C indicates heat<br>
emission caused by the reaction between the electrolyte<br>
and cathode, while the peak at about 240°C indicates heat<br>
emission caused by combined factors including the<br>
reaction between the electrolyte and cathode and the<br>
structural collapse of the cathode. On the contrary, as<br>
shown in FIGs. 2, 3 and 4, each battery using the<br>
electrode comprising succinonitrile (R=C2H4) (Example 1),<br>
 glutaronitrile (R=C3H6) (Example 2), adiponitrile (R=C4H8)<br>
 (Example 3), pimelonitrile (R=C5H10) (Example 4),<br>
octanedinitrile (r=csh12) (Example 5), azelonitrile<br>
(R=C7H14) (Example 6), sebaconitrile (R=C8H15) (Example 7)<br>
or dodecanedinitrile (R=C10H20) (Example 8) does not show<br>
the above two temperature peaks. This indicates that it<br>
was possible to inhibit heat emission caused by the<br>
reaction between the electrolyte and cathode and<br>
structural collapse of the cathode, in the case of the<br>
batteries according to the present invention.<br>
3. Overcharge test<br>
Each battery obtained from Example 1 and<br>
Comparative Example 1 was tested under the overcharge<br>
conditions of 6V/1A, 6V/2A, 12V/1C and 20V/1C in a CC/CV<br>
(Constant Current/Constant Voltage) manner. The test<br>
results including variation in temperatures are shown in<br>
FIGs. 5-9. As shown in FIGs. 5-9, the battery according<br>
to Example 1 shows more improved safety compared to the<br>
battery according to Comparative Example 1 (test results<br>
for the battery according to Comparative Example 1 are<br>
shown in FIG. 6 only for the test condition of 6V/1A and<br>
the others are not shown).<br>
Particularly, as can be seen from the peak<br>
temperature in FIG. 6 (Comparative Example 1), the<br>
battery was fired and subjected to short circuit at a<br>
measuring temperature of 200oC or higher due to the <br>
 oxidation of electrolyte present in the battery and the<br>
exothermic reaction resulting from the structural<br>
collapse of the cathode. On the contrary, the secondary<br>
 battery using the electrode comprising succinonitrile<br>
(ExampLe 1) shows a peak temperature of about 100oC. This<br>
 indicates that exothermic reactions were inhibited in<br>
the battery according to Example 1.<br>
The above overcharge test was repeated many times<br>
and the average values for the test results are shown in'<br>
the following Table i.<br>
 [Table 1]<br>
4. Hot box test<br>
Each battery obtained from Example l and<br>
Comparative Example 1 was fully charged. The charged<br>
batteries were introduced into an oven capable of<br>
convection and heated at a rate of 5°C/min from room<br>
temperature to 160°C and 170°C. Then the batteries were<br>
exposed to such high temperatures for 1 hour to check<br>
whether they are fired or not.<br>
The battery according to Comparative Example 1 was<br>
fired at 160°C when heated at a rate of 5°C/min (FIG.<br>
10), while the battery accordi ng to Example 1 was not<br>
fired under the same condition (FIGs. 11 and 12).<br>
5. Test for battery performance (1)<br>
Each battery obtained from Examples 1-8 and<br>
Comparative Example 1 was exposed to a high temperature<br>
of 90°C for 4 hours and subjected to a bulge test for<br>
measuring a change in thickness of the battery. The test<br>
results are shown in FIG. 13 Although the results for<br>
Examples 1 and 2 are not shown in FIG. 13, the batteries<br>
according to Example 1 and 2 showed a significantly<br>
decreased change in thickness, compared to the battery<br>
of Comparative Example 1. As shown in FIG. 13, the<br>
batteries according to Examples 3-8 showed excellent<br>
high-temperature stability with substantially no change<br>
in thickness.<br>
Changes in thickness of a battery may result from<br>
safety of an electrolyte, decomposition at a high<br>
temperature, reaction between a cathode surface and<br>
 electrolyte, etc. Alkanes having dinitrile functional<br>
groups used in the present invention provide excellent<br>
 effect in high-temperature storage.<br>
 Therefore, as shown in FIG. 13, electrodes<br>
comprising aliphatic dinitrile compounds provide<br>
excellent thermal stability.<br>
6. Test for battery performance (2)<br>
The battery according to Comparative Example 2 was<br>
compared to the battery according to Example 9 in terms<br>
of low-temperature performance. Each battery fully<br>
charged to 4.2V was discharged to 3V at a current of 1C<br>
(950 mA) in a constant current (CC) manner at -10°C to<br>
measure the low-temperature performance. The results are<br>
shown in FIG. 14.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, both batteries show a<br>
significant difference in terms of 10°C discharge<br>
capacity.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 14, in the case of the<br>
battery (Comparative Example 2) using an aliphatic<br>
nitrile compound added to the electrolyte, there is a<br>
problem in that the additive increases the viscosity of.<br>
electrolyte to reduce the diffusion of Li ions,<br>
resulting in degradation in the battery performance. On<br>
the other hand, in the case of the battery (Example 9)<br>
using the cathode coated with an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound, there is an advantage in that the battery<br>
safety can be improved with no degradation in the<br>
battery performance by virtue of the formation of a<br>
chemically strong complex between the nitrile functional<br>
group and the cathode, even if the content of the<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound is equal to or greater than<br>
the amount thereof added to the electrolyte.<br>
Meanwhile, each battery according to Comparative<br>
 Examples 3-10 and Examples 10-17, fully charged to 4.2V,<br>
was discharged to 3V at a current of 1C (750 mA) in a<br>
constant current (CC) manner at -10°C to measure the low-<br>
temperature performance. The results are shown the<br>
following Table 2.<br>
 [Table 2]<br>
As can be seen from Table 2, when 383562-type<br>
lithium polymer batteries according to Comparative<br>
Examples 3-10 and Examples 10-17 were tested in terms of<br>
low-temperature performance, the batteries (Examples 10-<br>
17) using the cathode coated with 3 wt% or more of an<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound shows excellent: battery<br>
performance compared to the batteries. (Comparative<br>
Examples 3-10) using 3 wt% of an aliphatic nitrile<br>
 compound as an additive for electrolyte, in the same<br>
manner as the 523450 type prismatic lithium batteries<br>
according to Comparative Example 2 and Example 9.<br>
Additionally, in the case of the batteries<br>
according to Examples 10-17, most of the batteries show<br>
 an efficiency of 83% or more regardless of the kind of<br>
aliphatic nitrile compound. On the other hand, in the<br>
case of the batteries (Comparative Examples 3-10) using<br>
an aliphatic nitrile compound as an additive for<br>
electrolyte show a difference in efficiency ranging from<br>
 71% to 78% depending on the differences in physical<br>
properties of the additive, viscosity and Li ion<br>
diffusion.<br>
7. Test for battery performance (3)<br>
Each of the batteries according to Comparative<br>
 Example 2 and Example 9 was stored at a high temperature<br>
(90°C, 4 hours) and then tested for the interfacial<br>
resistance in the battery.<br>
To measure the interfacial resistance, the battery<br>
fully charged to 4.2V was tested under the conditions of<br>
a DC voltage of OV based on an open circuit, an AC<br>
amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency ranging from 105 (Hz)<br>
to 10-1 (Hz). Additionally, the Nyquist presentation<br>
method was used wherein Z' (real number part) and -Z"<br>
(imaginary number part) are shown in the x-axis and y-<br>
axis, respectively. The results are shown in FIG. 15.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, the battery according to<br>
Comparative Example 2 shows an increase in interfacial<br>
resistance as the content of the aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound added to the electrolyte increases. On the<br>
other hand, the battery (Example 9) using the cathode<br>
coated with 3 wt% of the aliphatic nitrile compound,<br>
obtained by dipping a cathode into the coating solution<br>
containing the aliphatic nitrile compound, shows a<br>
significantly low interfacial resistance.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to improve battery<br>
safety with no degradation in battery performance when<br>
the aliphatic nitrile compound is not added to an<br>
electrolyte but is incorporated into an electrode.<br>
8. Test for battery performance (4)<br>
Each battery obtained from Example 18 (using a<br>
cathode coated with succinonitrile) and Comparative<br>
Example 11 (using a non-coated cathode) was subjected to<br>
charge/discharge cycles in a hot chamber at 45oC with a<br>
constant current (1C/1C) .<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, there is a significant<br>
difference between the battery (Example 18) using a<br>
cathode coated with succinonitrile and the battery<br>
(Comparative Example 11) using a non-coated cathode, in<br>
terms of high-temperature life characteristics. When<br>
 compared to the battery according to Comparative Example<br>
11, the battery according to Example 18 shows a less<br>
decrease in discharge capacity during repeated<br>
charge/discharge cycles, thereby providing improved life<br>
characteristics. On the other hand, the battery<br>
according to Comparative Example 11 shows a significant<br>
decrease in discharge capacity during repeated<br>
charge/discharge cycles.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the battery<br>
using an electrode comprising an aliphatic nitrile<br>
compound according to the present invention can inhibit<br>
heat emission caused by the reaction of an electrolyte<br>
with a cathode and the structural collapse of a cathode,<br>
and can reduce the calorific value due to the heat<br>
emission. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a battery<br>
from being fired due to the generation of internal short<br>
circuit resulting from an excessive heat emission upon<br>
overcharge. Further, it is possible to avoid degradation<br>
in battery performance including problems of an increase<br>
in electrolyte viscosity and an increase in interfacial<br>
resistance, occurring when an aliphatic nitrile compound<br>
is added to an electrolyte.<br>
Additionally, the compound represented by formula<br>
1 used in the present invention will not be reduced<br>
easily during the charge cycle of a battery and will not<br>
be decomposed easily even under high voltage. Therefore,<br>
it is possible to inhibit the structural collapse of a<br>
cathode efficiently as well as to improve the<br>
performance and safety of a battery due to the<br>
electrochemical stability of the compound.<br>
