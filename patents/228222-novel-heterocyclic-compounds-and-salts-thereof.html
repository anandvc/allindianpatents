				<td>The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which have a hypoglycemic action, a blood hypolipidemic action, an insulin resistance-improving action or a PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)-activating action. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the above-mentioned novel heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a hypoglycemic agent, a hypolipidemic agent, an insulin  , resistance improver, a therapeutic agent of diabetes, an anti-diabetic complication agent (i.e., a therapeutic agent of diabetic complication), a glucose tolerance improver, an anti-atherosclerosis agent, an anti-obesity agent, an antiinflammatory agent, an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of PPAR-mediated disease and an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of syndrome X, all of which comprising the above-mentioned novel heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As a therapeutic agent of diabetes, biguanide compounds having, as a main action, an inhibitory action on glucose absorption via the intestinal tract and on glucose release from the liver, sulfonylurea compounds having an accelerating action on insulin secretion as a main action, insulin and the lilce have been employed. However, biguanide compounds cause lactic acidosis, and sulfonylurea compounds sometimes cause serious hypoglycemia due to their strong hypoglycemic action. Therefore, a due care should be given when in use of these compounds.  In recent years, there have been active researches<br><br>
and developments of a therapeutic agent of diabetes, which is free of these defects, with the consequence that various compounds having an insulin resistance-improving action have been found.<br>
The insulin resistance is important as a cause of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), along with decrease in the insulin secretion. Therefore, the development of a pharmaceutical agent that improves insulin resistance has been desired. Various thiazolidine compounds are known as the agent capable of improving the insulin resistance. As these compounds, for example, 5-[4-[(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)methoxy]benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: troglitazone) is described in JP-B-2-31079, 5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-pyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: pioglitazone) is described in JP-B-5-66956, and 5-[[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)amino]ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: rosiglitazone) is described in JP-A-1-131169.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compound having a hypoglycemic action, a blood hypolipidemic action, an insulin resistance-improving action and a PPAR activating action, which has a structure completely different from that of conventional compounds, thereby to increase the diversity in and to broaden the range of selection from hypoglycemic agents, hypolipidemic agents, insulin resistance improvers, therapeutic agents of diabetes, therapeutic agents of diabetic complications, glucose tolerance improvers, anti-atherosclerosis agents, anti-obesity agents, antiinflammatory agents, agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of PPAR-mediated disease and agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of syndrome X.<br>

Blood was drawn under a non-fasting state from the tail vein of male KK-A^ mice, which were spontaneously diabetic models, had developed diabetes due to insulin resistance and which showed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.  The glucose<br><br>
level in the plasma was measured using a commercially available assay kit (glucose Cll-test WAKO, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).  The mice were grouped (5 mice per group) into a control group and an administration group, such that the mean and the standard deviation of the glucose level in the plasma of each group were nearly the same. Each test compound was suspended or dissolved in 5% gum arable solution and administered orally to the administration group for 4 consecutive days from the next day.  The 5% gum arable solution was orally administered to the control group. Blood was drawn from the tail vein under a non-fasting state about 24 hours after the final administration and the glucose level in the plasma was measured.  The decrease in the plasma glucose level was calculated from the following formula.  The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

Blood was drawn under a non-fasting state from the tail vein of male KK-A^ mice, which were spontaneously diabetic models, had developed diabetes due to insulin resistance and which showed hyperglucemia and hyperinsulemia. The glucose level in the plasma was measured using a commercially available assay kit (glucose Cll-test WAKO, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).  The mice were grouped (5 mice per group) into a control group and an administration group, such that the mean and the standard deviation of the glucose level in the plasma of each group were nearly the same. Each test compound was admixed in a proportion of 0.1 w/w% with a powder feed (CE-2, Clea) and the feed mixture was fed to the administration group for 4 days from the next day. A regular powder feed was fed to the control group. At day 5, blood was drawn from the tail vein under a non-fasting state and the glucose level in the plasma was measured.  The decrease in the plasma glucose level was calculated from the following formula.  The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

Experimental Example 3 hypotriglyceridemic action<br>
Blood was drawn under a non-fasting state from the tail vein of male KK-A^ mice, which were spontaneously diabetic models, had developed diabetes due to insulin resistance, and which showed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.  The triglyceride level in the plasma was measured using a commercially available assay kit (triglyceride G-test WAKO, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).  The mice were grouped (5 mice per group) into a control group and an administration group, such that the mean and the standard deviation of the triglyceride level in the plasma of each group were nearly the same. Each test compound was suspended or dissolved in 5% gum arable solution and administered orally to the administration group for 4 consecutive days from the next day, The 5% gum arable solution was orally administered to the control group.  Blood was drawn from the tail vein under a non-fasting state about 24 hours after the final administration and the triglyceride level in the plasma was measured.  The decrease in the plasma triglyceride level was calculated from the following formula.  The results are shown in Table 3.<br>

Experimental Example 4 Hypoglycemic action and hypoinsulinemic action in insulin resistant diabetic mouse<br>
The insulin resistance improving action was examined in KK-A^ mice, which were spontaneously diabetic models, had developed diabetes due to insulin resistance, and which showed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Blood was drawn from the tail vein of 12-week-old male KK-A^ mice under a non-fasting state, and the glucose level in the plasma was measured using a commercially available assay kit (glucose Cll-test WAKO, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).  The mice were grouped (5 mice per group) into a control group and an administration group, such that the mean glucose level in the<br><br>
plasma and the average body weight of each group, as well as the standard deviation thereof were nearly the same. The test compound (10 mg/kg) was suspended in 5% aqueous gum arable solution and orally administered once a day to the i administration group for 4 days from the next day.  The 5% aqueous gum arable solution was orally administered to the control group. Blood was drawn from the tail vein under a non-fasting state 24 hours after the final administration. The concentrations of plasma glucose and plasma insulin were measured.  The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
As a result, each test compound (10 mg/kg) lowered the glucose level in plasma and also decreased the insulin concentration in plasma. This means that the test compound lowered the plasma glucose level not by insulin secretion but by insulin sensitivity potentiating action (insulin resistance improving action), thereby to improve hyperinsulinemia.<br><br>
Experiment.al Example 5 Triglyceride accumulation promoting action in 3T3-L1 cells<br>
A culture medium of 80% confluent 3T3-L1 cells was removed and the cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution.  5% FBS-DMEM (the same amount as the removed medium) was added and the obtained cell suspension was centrifuged at 25°C, lOOxg for 1 min to give cell sediment and<br><br>
the supernatant was removed.  The cells were re-suspended in a suitable amount of 5% FBS-DMEM medium and the cells were counted.  5% FBS-DMEM medium was added to adjust the concentration to 1x10 cells/ml and the mixture was dispensed by 1 ml to a 24 well plate.  The cells were cultured with aeration of 5% CO2 at 37°C for 2 days.  Upon confirmation of a post-confluent state, the culture supernatant was changed to a medium containing 0.5 mM-IBMX, and the cells were cultured for 2 days. Then, the medium was changed to a medium containing 10 ng/ml insulin and 10"^ M test compound and the cells were cultured further for 4 days. After removing the culture supernatant, the cells were lysed in a 0.1% SDS solution and the triglyceride amount was measured.  The triglyceride accumulation (%) due to the potentiation of insulin activity by the test compound was calculated from the following formula.  The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
[(triglyceride amount with addition of test compound -triglyceride amount of control) / triglyceride amount of control]xlOO<br><br><br>
