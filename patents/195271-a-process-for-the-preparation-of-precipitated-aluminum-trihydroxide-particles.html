				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of precipitated aluminum trihydroxide particles from a supersaturated sodium aluminate solution, especially the precipitation of aluminum trihydroxide from Bayer process liquor.<br>
Various attempts have been made in the past to increase the yield and particle size of the aluminum trihydroxide recovered from Bayer process liquors.<br>
Recent attempts at improvements have included modifying various aspects of the process including improved precipitation by directing the incoming pregnant liquor stream into a first series of tanks known as the agglomeration section, followed by directing the slurry thus obtained to a second series of tanks known as the growth section. Further improvements and changes have been described in for instance U.S. patents 2,707,669, 4,234,559, 4,305,913, 4,311,486, 4,364,919, 4,617,179, 5,102,426 and French patent FR 1,391,596.<br>
The basic principles of the Bayer process have not changed in the more than 100 years which have elapsed since the original patent was granted. In a typical example the following operations are performed in turn: (1) dissolution of the alumina at a high temperature; (2) separation and washing of insoluble impurities of bauxite (red muds) to recover the soluble alumina and caustic soda; (3) partial hydrolysis of sodium aluminate at a lower temperature to precipitate aluminum trihydroxide; (4) regeneration of the solutions for reuse by evaporation of the water introduced by the washing; and (5) calcination of the aluminum trihydroxide to anhydrous alumina.<br>
The term "pregnant liquor" means a highly supersaturated solution of alumina dissolved in sodium hydroxide. It has been filtered to remove solid inerts and impurities.<br>
The   term  "caustic   concentration"  means   the   concentration  of total   sodium  hydroxide  in  the  solution  in  grams/litre,   expressed  as equivalent  Na2CO3.<br>
The   term  "seed"  means   relatively  small   aluminum  trihydroxide crystals,   which  serve   for  the   agglomeration   section,   upon  which   the dissolved  alumina   can  precipitate.<br>
The  term  "ratio"   is   the  ratio  of  dissolved  alumina  expressed  as g/L  AI2O2:total   caustic  as   g/L  NaOH,   but   expressed  in   equivalent g/L  Na2CO3.<br>
After   separation  of  the  pregnant   liquor   from  the   insoluble residues   present   in   the  bauxite,   the  pregnant   liquor   is   cooled  in preparation   for  precipitating   their  aluminum  trihydroxide   content. To   induce  precipitation,   aluminate   liquor   is   seeded  with   seed obtained   from  previously  precipitated  crystals,   and  the  mixture   is agitated.   The   seed  grows   to   an  acceptable   size   and  is   then   separated from  the   liquor.   Usually  the  process   comprises   a   first   agglomeration step,   followed  by  a   second  growth  step.   The  aluminum  trihydroxide from  precipitation  is   filtered  and  washed,   and  the  alumina   is   now ready  to  undergo   calcination.   Calcination   changes   the   composition and  crystalline   structure   of  the   alumina  without   changing  particle shape.<br>
European   and  American  plants   employ  slightly  different variations   of  the   Bayer  process.   European  plants   use  much  higher caustic  concentrations   for  digestion  of  bauxite  ore.   This  more concentrated  liquor   requires   less   energy  per  unit   volume  of   liquor circulated.<br>
In  the  American  process,   use  of  a  more  dilute   caustic  solution results   in  production  of  larger  particles,   although  at   a   somewhat lower   yield.<br>
The   Bayer  process   as   practised  in  Europe   and  the  United  States has   evolved  over   the   years   to   satisfy  the  demands  made  by  the continuous  and  ongoing  development  of  the  process.   These  demands  now include:<br>
1.       High   yield   from  the  process   liquor,   to  minimize   the   energy requirements   of  the  process,   and  to  maximize   the  production   rate<br>
from  existing   facilities.   In  practice   this   implies   precipitation from  a   caustic   solution  having  a   caustic   concentration  higher   than previously  considered  normal   for  North  American  Bayer  circuits -   typically  150-200   gpl  NaOH  caustic  expressed  as   Na2CO3   -   now  200-300   gpl.<br>
2.	Production  of  a  coarse  granular  product,   to  minimize  dusting and  facilitate  handling  in  subsequent  phases  of  metal  production  -typically  less   than  10%-45  micron.<br>
3.	Production  of  a  crystal  with  a  morphology  which  is   resistant  to breakdown  during  and  after   rough  treatment   in  modern   fluid   flash calciners.   Typically  a  breakdown  of   less   than   4%-45  micron  during calcination,   and  an  Attrition   Index  of   less   than   20   after calcination,   are   required.<br>
4.	Production  of  a  material  with  a   low  total   soda   content,   to match   the   low  losses   from  modern  dry-scrubbed  long-life   cells   in  the smelters,   and  to   avoid  excess   bath  generation.   Typically,   values   of less   than   0.4%   Na2O   (calcined  basis)   are  now  required.<br>
The  precipitation   circuit   usually  comprises   a   first   reaction circuit   (agglomeration   stage)   and  a   second   reaction   circuit    (growth stage).<br>
In  a   typical   example,   the  precipitation   circuit   includes   a chain  of  up  to  20,   for  example   10-15   tanks   or  vessels,   also   called precipitators.   The   tanks   include  two   sizes.   Usually  2-4   smaller tanks   each  of   for  example   1000  m3   capacity  to  provide   a   residence time  of   2   hours   comprise   the   agglomeration   stage   of   the precipitation   circuit;   the   remaining   tanks,   comprising  the   growth stage,   may  each  have   a   capacity  of   for  example   4000  m3   or  more,   to provide   a   residence   time   of   4   hours.   All   these   tanks   or  vessels   are often  provided  with  agitators   of  generally  conventional   character, to   effect   the   requisite   agitation  of   the   liquor  during  the precipitation  operation.   The   larger    (growth   stage)    tanks   may  be fitted  with  weirs   to   skim  liquor   from  the   top   surface  of   the contents   of  the   tank   and  cooling  devices   to   remove  heat   from  the contents.<br>
The  incoming  pregnant   liquor  preferably  has   a   temperature   of between   65   °C  and   90   °C,   for  example   70   °C  and   85   °C,   with   the typical   temperature  being  about   75   °C.   The  pregnant   liquor  usually has   a   concentration   of   100   grams/litre  to   400   grams/litre,   for example   150   grams/litre   to   300   grams/litre  of   total   caustic  and  a ratio  of   0.5   to   0.8,   for  example   0.6   to   0.75   of  dissolved  alumina   to total   caustic.   Cooling  of  the   incoming  pregnant   liquor  may  be accomplished  in  the  plant  heat   exchange  network  prior   to   its admission   to   the  precipitation  section.<br>
As   indicated  above,   alumina  production  capacity  can  be increased  by  operating   the   Bayer   liquor   cycle   at  higher   caustic   soda concentrations.   Plant  experience  however  reveals   that  there  is   a conflict   of  objectives   in   the  precipitation  process.   The   operating conditions   for  achieving  the  highest  yield  are  often  adverse  to meeting   other  objectives,   such  as   the   structure,   shape,   particle size  distribution  and  toughness   of  the  hydrate  particles   and maintaining  a  seed  balance.<br>
An  important  prerequisite   to  be   successful   in   the   high  yield mode  of   operation  is   to  have   ample   agglomeration  power  in   the precipitation   circuit   to   sustain  product   quality  and   seed  balance  by consuming  the  higher  amount   of   fines   which  is   inherent  in  maximum yield  mode   of  operation.<br>
Particle   size  distribution   control   and  particle  population balance   are   the  most   important,   difficult   to  predict,   and  poor understood  aspects  of  the  precipitation  process.   The  number  of particles   formed  by  nucleation  and  breakage  must   equal   the   number  of particles   removed   from  the   system  by  agglomeration   and/or   growth into  product,   or  by  dissolution.   The  operating  conditions   for achieving  the  highest   yield  are  often  adverse   to  meeting  other objectives,   such  as   product  particle   size,   chemical  purity  and  seed balance.<br>
The   general   approach  in  precipitation  product   quality   control is   to  produce  a   coarse,   agglomerated  but   strong  hydrate  which  does not   contain   fines   and  also  does   not  break  down  in  the   calciner. Several  precipitation   flowsheets,   some   simple   and   some   fairly<br>
complicated,   are  being  practised  to  meet   this   goal.   A  common   feature of   these   systems   is   an  agglomeration  stage  where  precipitation conditions   conductive  to  agglomeration  are  maintained.   This   is   then followed  by  a  toughening  stage  where  the  agglomerates   are  hardened by  further  deposition  of  hydrate.   The  hydrate   classification   system also  plays   an  important   role   in   yielding  a   coarse  product.   Hydro cyclones   and  other  hydraulic   classification  devices   are  being employed  to   improve   classification  over   that   achieved  in  primary  and secondary  settling  tanks.<br>
Because  of   fluctuations   of  the  process  parameters   originating outside   as   well   as   in   the  precipitation  department   there   is   often  an imbalance   in   seed  generation  and  seed   requirement.   Shortage   or excess   seed  are  both  undesired  because  both  hamper   the   operating stability  and  thus   the  production  capacity  of  the  precipitation circuit.<br>
The   conventional  method  to   control   the   seed  balance   is   by changing   the   agglomeration   ability  in   the   first  precipitator   tank.<br>
Factors   influencing  the  agglomeration  power  are   known  to  be:<br>
a)	solids   concentration   and  particle   size  distribution  in   the first  precipitator.<br>
b)	temperature   in  this   precipitator.<br>
c)	agitation.<br>
d)	degree  of  supersaturation  and  retention  time  of  the  liquor  in the  precipitator.<br>
f)        impurities,   seed  activity,   morphology  of   the   solids,   etc..<br>
The   objective   is   to  produce   a  proper   agglomerate  by  applying the   right   conditions   in  the   first   stage  of  the  precipitation process,   the   agglomeration   step.   The  proper  agglomerate   crystal   is   a composite   of   very   small   single   crystals   cemented   together  by precipitated  alumina   trihydrate   to   give   a   spherical  particle ideally.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the preparation of precipitated aluminum trihydroxide particles from a supersaturated sodium aluminate solution, comprising the steps of<br>
(a)	supplying a stream of supersaturated sodium aluminate solution and a first stream of aluminum trihydroxide particles as seed particles to a first reaction circuit,<br>
(b)	maintaining the sodium aluminate stream containing the stream of seed particles in the first reaction circuit under conditions mainly resulting in precipitation and agglomeration of aluminum trihydroxide,<br>
(c)	passing the stream thus obtained to a second reaction circuit in which the stream is maintained under conditions mainly resulting in precipitation and growth of aluminum trihydroxide particles,<br>
(d)	passing the stream obtained in the second reaction circuit to a separation/classification unit to separate the stream into a first aluminum trihydroxide product stream comprising the coarser particle size portion, a second aluminum trihydroxide product stream comprising the finer particle size portion and a spent liquor stream, and<br>
(e)	supplying a second stream of aluminum trihydroxide particles to spent liquor and dissolving at least part of the aluminum trihydroxide in the spent liquor and introducing the stream thus obtained into the sodium aluminate solution containing the first fraction of aluminum trihydroxide particles in the first reaction circuit; wherein pregnant liquor has a temperature between 65 and 90°C and spent liquor obtained in step (d) has a temperature between 40 and 65°C.<br>
At the other hand process variables should be kept such that the generation of mono crystals and aggregates are prevented. An aggregate crystal is similar to the agglomerate except that fewer and larger crystals make up the particle.  The surface of the<br>
particle  is   therefore  more  rugged.   This   along  with  the  mono  crystals will   yield  shattering  of   the  particles   and  chipping  of   the   rugged edges   in  the  calciner  resulting  in  excessive   fines.<br>
In   case  of  excess   fine   seed  inventory  the   seed  balance   is regained  by:<br>
increasing  the   first   tank   temperature.<br>
calcination  of  the   seed  and  produce  an  off   spec  product<br>
temporarily.<br>
reducing   the   first   tank  holding  time.<br>
storing  the  excess   fine   seed  temporarily.<br>
In   case   of   shortage  of   fine   seed  the   seed  stock   is   regained  by:<br>
reduction  in   the   first   tank   temperature.<br>
coarse   seed  is   supplemented  in   the   first  precipitator   tank.<br>
Most   of   the   time   a   situation  of  excess   fine   seed  will   occur because  most   of  the  measures   taken  to  maximize  production  are conflicting  with  the  production  of   a   coarse  product.<br>
Various   parameters   are   used  in  precipitation   to   control   the quality  of  the  hydrate  and  alumina.   Following  is   a   short  description of  the  most   frequently  used  variables    (A-D)   in  the   alumina   industry to  control  the  quality  of  the  precipitated  aluminum  trihydrate. A.   Temperature<br>
The   temperature   in   the  agglomeration   section   is   usually  kept   at a   fixed  level  and  is  not  altered  unless   there  is   a  major  process upset,   for  example  the  formation  of  oxalate  crystals.   In  that  case the  temperature  usually  will  be  increased.<br>
The   temperature   in   the   agglomeration   section  may  also  be increased  in  case  of  excess   seed  to  enhance   the  agglomeration  of fine  particles   into  product   size  hydrate.   In   case   of   low  seed inventory  the   temperature   in  the   agglomeration   section  may  be lowered  to  generate  more   fines  by  enhancing  nucleation.   Reason   for temperature   adjustment   can  be  dictated  by  the   level   of  occluded  soda in   the  product  hydrate.   An  increase   in  temperature   has   the   effect   of lowering  the  occluded  soda  while  the   reverse  effect  is   observed  when the   temperature   is   reduced.   In  general   the   temperature  will   be<br>
brought  back  gradually  to   the  original   level   after   the  problem  is corrected.<br>
B.	Seedcharge<br>
Seedcharge  may  be  used  in  several  ways   to   control   the  product particle   size  distribution  and  occluded   soda.   Lowering  the   fine   seed to   the  agglomeration  section  has   the  effect   of  increasing   the agglomeration  of  the   fine  particles  while   the  opposite  is   the  case at  increased  seed  charge.   The  occluded  soda  in  the  hydrate  can  also be   reduced  by  increasing  the   seed  charge   to   the   agglomeration section.   The  mechanism  in   this   case   causing  the   effects   is   probably the  precipitation   rate  which   is   lowered  at   increased   seed  charge because   of  the   increase   in   surface   area   exposed  to   the   same   amount of  liquor  and  the   reduction  of   the  driving   force   in   the   case   of increased  spent  liquor   recycle.<br>
The-  seedcharge   is   usually  maintained  at   a   level   to   obtain   a desired  particle   size  distribution   coming  out   of   the   agglomeration section.   This   PSD   is   periodically  measured   and   the   seed   charge   is adjusted  accordingly.<br>
In   case  of   shortage   of   seed  the   consequences   are   not   too dramatic  and  temperature   adjustment   can  bring  the   solution  without much  harm  to   the   PSD  of   the  hydrate  but   the   attrition  index  and chemical   quality  may  be  deteriorated.   The  problem  can  be   aggravated by  upsets   in   the  digestion   ratio   control,   clarification  mud  washing, and  calcination  outages.<br>
C.	Crystal   growth  modifiers<br>
Chemical  additives   are  used  by  several  plants   to  stabilize oxalate   in  liquor  and  to  enhance   agglomeration  of   fine   seed  in   the agglomeration   section  of   the  precipitation  department.<br>
D.	Hydrate   toughening<br>
Solids   retention,   precipitation  holding   time   after agglomeration  and  product   recycle   are  the  most   common  methods   to strengthen  the   fragile   agglomerates   to  produce   strong  hydrate particles   which   can  withstand  the   thermal   and  physical   attrition   in the   calcination   step.   Various   precipitation   seeding   routes   are<br>
employed  to  give   the  product   the   required  number  of  passes   before being  removed  from  the  precipitation   circuit   as  product.<br>
As   already  indicated  above,   methods   to   increase   the productivity  of  the   Bayer  process   usually  result   in   the  production of  a  higher  amount  of  fines.<br>
A  recent  publication  by  Sang  et.   al.    (Light  Metals   1989,   p.   33-39)   proposes   to  dissolve   the  excess   fine   seed  in  the  green  liquor (or  pregnant  liquor)   prior  to   feeding  the  precipitators.<br>
The   seed  dissolution  in  green  liquor  as   proposed  by Sang  et.   al.   has   the  disadvantage   that   relatively  high   temperatures have   to  be   applied  to  dissolve   the   seed  in   the   already  highly supersaturated   sodium  aluminate   liquor  while   this   liquor  has   a   high scaling  tendency.   At  very  high  alumina   concentrations   in   the   liquor it  will  be   almost   impossible   to   further  dissolve   seed  in   the   liquor.<br>
To  overcome  the  above  problem  it  is   now  proposed  to  dissolve any  excess   of  fines  in  spent  liquor,   rather  than  in  pregnant  liquor. This   overcomes   the  above  described  problems.<br>
The present invention, therefore, relates to a process for the precipitation of aluminum trihydroxide from a supersaturated sodium aluminate   solution,   comprising   the   steps   of<br>
(a)	supplying  a  stream  of  supersaturated  sodium  aluminate  solution and  a   first   stream  of   aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   as   seed particles   to  a   first   reaction   circuit,<br>
(b)	maintaining  the   sodium  aluminate   stream  containing   the   stream of  seed  particles   in  the   first   reaction  circuit  under  conditions mainly  resulting  in  precipitation   and  agglomeration  of   aluminum trihydroxide,<br>
(c)	passing  the  stream  thus  obtained  to  a  second  reaction  circuit in  which  the   stream  is  maintained  under   conditions  mainly   resulting in  precipitation  and  growth  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles,<br>
(d)	passing  the   stream  obtained  in  the   second   reaction   circuit   to   a separation/classification  unit   to   separate   the   stream  into  a   first aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream  comprising  the   coarser  particle size  portion,   a   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream<br>
comprising  the   finer  particle   size  portion  and  a   spent   liquor stream,<br>
(e)     supplying  a  second  stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   to spent   liquor  and  dissolving  at   least  part   of  the   aluminum trihydroxide  in  the   spent   liquor  and  introducing   the   stream  thus obtained  into   the   sodium  aluminate   solution  containing   the   first stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   in  the   first  reaction circuit.<br>
In  a   continuous   Bayer  process   at  least  a  part,   usually  the largest  part,   of   the   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream comprising  the   finer  particle   size  portion   as   described  in   step   (d) will  be   used  as   the   first   stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles, i.e.   the   seed   fraction,   as  mentioned  in   step   (a).   However,   a  part may  originate   from  another   source,   on  a   continuous   base   or   on  a batch  base,   e.g.   from  another   Bayer  plant,   a  bleed   stream  of   the same   Bayer  plant   or   rejected  product.   Small   amounts   of   spent   liquor are   often  used  to  displace   the   seed  particles.   In   the   continuous Bayer  process   the  part   of   the   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product stream  which   is   not   used  as   the   seed   fraction  of   step   (a)   will   be used  as   the   second   fraction  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   as mentioned  in   step   (e).   Also   for  this   fraction  other   sources,   as indicated  above,   may  be  used.<br>
Preferably,   the   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream  is divided  into   the   first   and  second  stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide particles   only.   It   is   further  preferred  that   the   second  stream  of aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   comprises   up  to  20%,   preferably  up to   12%   of   the   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream  as mentioned  in  step   (d).<br>
In  view  of  the   excess   seed  production  due   to   attempts   to increase   of   the   liquor  productivity  as   already  discussed  before,   it will  be   clear   that   the   second  stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide particles   as  mentioned  in   step   (e)   more   or   less   concerns   the   excess seed  production.   In  the   case   of  higher  productivity  while   keeping the   conditions   in  the   first   reaction   circuit   the   same    (same   amount of  pregnant   liquor,   same   amount   of   seed,   temperature,    ratio   etc.),<br>
an   increase   in  productivity  will   result   in   an  excess   of   seed. Dissolving  part   of   the   seed  in   spent   liquor   in   such   a  way  that   a solution   is   obtained  comparable   to   the  pregnant   liquor,   and  using the  non-dissolved  part   as   seed   for  this   solution,   will   result   in  an increased  productivity  of  the  precipitation  stage,   while   the   quality of  the  product  will   remain  the   same   or  almost   the   same.   Therefore, it   is   preferred  to  dissolve   such  an  amount   of   the   second  stream  of aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   in  a   certain  amount   of   spent   liquor that  the  A/C  ratio  of  the  solution  obtained  is   the  same  as   the  A/C ratio   of   the  pregnant   liquor.   Further,   it   is   also  preferred  that   the ratio   of   the   amount   of   the   solution  obtained  after  dissolving  part of   second  stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   and  the   amount of  non-dissolved  second  stream  aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   is the   same   as   the   amount   of  pregnant   liquor   and  the   first   stream  of aluminum  trihydroxide  particles   introduced  into   the   first   reaction circuit.   If  necessary,   the   spent   liquor  used  in   step   (e)   may  be concentrated  when   the   caustic   concentration,   due   to   for   instance washings,   is   too   low.   Preferably  the   caustic   concentration   in   the spent   liquor   to  be  used  is   the   same  as   in   the  pregnant   liquor. Usually  between   5   and   50%   of   the   second   stream  of   aluminum trihydroxide  particles   is   dissolved  in   the   spent   liquor,   preferably 10   to   40%.<br>
Part   of   the   spent   liquor  obtained  in   step   (d)   is   preferably used   for   the   spent   liquor   stream  mentioned  in   step   (e).   The supersaturated  sodium  aluminate   solution  as   described  in   step   (a)   is preferably  obtained  by  digesting  bauxite   using  at   least  part,   more preferably  all  but   the  amount  used   for   step   (e),   of   the   spent   liquor obtained  in   step   (d).<br>
The  pregnant   liquor  used  in   step   (a)   preferably  has   a temperature  between   65   and   90   °C,   preferably  between   70   and   85   °C, has   a   concentration  between   100   and   400   grams/litre,   preferably between  200   and  350   grams/litre,   of  total   caustic,   and  an  A/C   ratio of   0.5   to   0.8,   preferably  of   0.6   to   0.75.   The   spent   liquor  obtained in   step    (d)   preferably  has   a   temperature   between   4 0   and   65   °C,<br>
preferably  between   45   and   60   °C,   and  an  A/C   ratio   of   0.25   to   0.45, preferably  0.3  to  0.4.<br>
It   is   preferred  that   the  particles   of   the   aluminum  trihydroxide crystals   of  the   first   and  second  stream  of  aluminum  trihydroxide particles   have   a  median   size  between  25   and   60  micron,   preferably between  30   and   55  micron,   more  preferably  35   and  50  micron.<br>
It   is   further  preferred  that   the   first   aluminum  trihydroxide product   stream  comprises   less   than  25%  by  weight  of  product   smaller than   45  micron,   preferably  less   than   15%.   This   product   stream  is   the coarse   aluminum  trihydroxide   fraction  which  usually  will  be  used  for the  production  of   calcined,   anhydrous   alumina.<br>
The   separation/classification   step   is   carried  out  using techniques   well   known  in  the  art,   such  as   gravity  sedimentation, elutriation,   centrifugal   separation  by  hydrocyclones,   screening   and sieving.<br>
The  temperature  at  which  the   second  stream  of  aluminum trihydroxide  particles   is   dissolved  in   the   spent   liquor   fraction   is suitably  between   80   and  250   °C,   preferably  between   100   and  220   °C, more  preferably  between   120   and  180   °C.<br>
The   invention   is   illustrated  by  Figure   1.   Pregnant   liquor   is fed  via   line   (1)   to   the   first   reaction   circuit   (2),   the agglomeration  section,   of  the  precipitation  section.   The   reaction product  made   in   this   section   is   fed  via   line   (3)   to   the   second reaction   circuit   (4),   the   growth   section,   of   the  precipitation section.   The   reaction  product  obtained  in  this   section  is   fed  via line   5   to   the   separation/classification  unit   (6).   Coarse precipitated  product   (the   first   aluminum  trihydroxide  product stream)   is   removed  from  the  process   via   line   (7).   Spent  liquor  is removed  via   lines    (8)   and   (9).<br>
Fine   seed   (the   second  aluminum  trihydroxide  product   stream)   is fed  via  lines    (10)   and   (11)   to  the   first   reaction  circuit.   Part  of the   fine   seed  is   introduced  via   line   (12),   together  with   spent liquor  via   line   (9),   into  digestor   13.   After   (partial)   dissolution of   the   fine   seed,   the   reaction  product   of   this   unit   is   introduced into   the   first   reaction   circuit   (2)   via   line   (14).<br><br><br><br>
