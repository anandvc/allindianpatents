				<td>PROCESSES FOR PREPARING A POLYPEPTIDE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides processes for preparing a polypeptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. More specifically, the invention provides processes for preparing glatiramer acetate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
COPAXONE® is the trade name of glatiramer acetate, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. COPAXONE® is also known as Copolymer-1 . The COPAXONE® label discloses that COPAXONE® consists of the acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, containing four naturally-occurring amino acids: L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine and L-lysine with an average molar fraction of 0.141 , 0.427, 0.095 and 0.338, respectively, and has a weight average molecular weight of 4.7-1 1 .0 kilodaltons (kDa). COPAXPNE® comprises a mixture of polypeptides having different molecular weights and sequences. The structural formula of COPAXONE® is:<br>
(Glu, Ala, Lys, Tyr)x • xCH3COOH<br>
COPAXONE® is a white to off-white, sterile, lyophilized powder containing 20 mg glatiramer acetate and 40 mg of mannitol. It is supplied in single use vials for subcutaneous administration alter reconstitution with sterile water.<br>
Processes for preparing Copolymer-1 or glatiramer acetate have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,849,550; 5,800,808; 5,981,589; 6,048,898; 6,054,430; 6,342,476; and 6,362,161. The process for the synthesis of glatiramer acetate is based on the polymerization of A/-carboxyanhydrides of tyrosine, alanine, y-benzyl glutamate and /V-trifluoroacetyl lysine in anhydrous dioxane at room temperature using diethylamine as initiator, to form a protected polypeptide. The deblocking of the y-benzyl groups (first deprotection) is accomplished by stirring the protected polypeptide in hydrogen bromide/acetic acid at room temperature. These conditions also facilitate the cleavage of the copolymer. The next step is the removal of the Af-trifluoroacetyl groups (second deprotection) of the copolymer by treatment with 1 M piperidine. In the final steps, glatiramer acetate is obtained by purification of the copolymer through dialysis, followed by treatment<br>
with acetic acid to form the acetate salt and by another purification by dialysis against water. Thus, these prior art processes involve the polymerization of four A/-carboxyanhydrides, two deprotection steps, two purification steps and one acetate salt formation step.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,620,847 describes a process for preparing Copolymer-1 which involves treating trifluoroacetyl Copolymer-1 with aqueous piperidine to form a solution of Copolymer-1 and purifying Copolymer-1.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0091956 describes a three-step process for preparing glatiramer acetate. The process involves polymerization of a mixture of the A/-carboxyanhydrides of L-alanine, L-tyrosine, protected L-glutamate and protected L-lysine, to obtain a protected polypeptide or salt thereof; and deprotection of the protected polypeptide or salt thereof by either palladium catalytic transfer hydrogenation or palladium catalytic hydrogenation under hydrogen pressure.<br>

Preferably, the diethylamine is present in an amount of from about 0.001 weight percent (wt. %) to about 2 wt. %, more preferably from about 0.01 wt. % to about 0.02 wt. %, based on the weight of the mixture of A/-carboxyanhydride of L-tyrosine, A/-carboxyanhydride of L-alanine, /V-carboxyanhydride of protected L-glutamate and A/-carboxyanhydride of A/-f-butoxycarbonyl L-lysine.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, water is added to the polymerization mixture following polymerization. The addition of water results in precipitation of the protected polypeptide. The water is preferably removed from the mixture containing water and protected polypeptide by vacuum filtration and the recovered protected polypeptide is dried. Methods of drying are known to those skilled in the art, such as vacuum drying.<br>
In the deprotecting step, Step (ii), of the process of the invention, an acid is added to the protected polypeptide which is formed in Step (i) to form a polypeptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Undesired low molecular weight polypeptide or glatiramer fragments, i.e., less than about 2 kDa, and high molecular weight polypeptide or glatiramer fragments, i.e.r greater than about 40 kDa, are preferably removed by such methods as dialysis or diafiltration. Preferred membranes include Visking partially permeable cellulose membranes, such as a Size 6 membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 12-14 kDa, available from Medicell International Ltd., and tangential flow filtration (TFF) membranes, such as a Pellicon XL PLCCC 10 (50 cm2) or PLCCC 5 (50 cm2), available from Millipore. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the deprotected polypeptide or deprotected glatiramer is dissolved in water and subjected to dialysis, followed by dialysis in aqueous acetic acid solution.<br>
The present inventors have determined that the desired molecular weight polypeptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be controlled by dilution, concentration of • the acid added in Step (ii) or Step (b), and/or time.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, water is removed from the deprotected polypeptide. A preferred method of removal is lyophilization. In lyophilization, the solution is frozen and placed under vacuum so that the water (ice) vaporizes in the vacuum (sublimes) without melting and the non-water components (deprotected polypeptide and residual salt) are left behind in an undamaged state, i.e., without chemical decomposition. The dried product of lyophilization contains the deprotected polypeptide and residual salt.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the deprotected polypeptide is treated with glacial acetic acid to form glatiramer acetate salt. The glatiramer acetate salt is collected preferably by lyophilization to yield a glatiramer acetate salt product.<br>
II.        Phase Transfer Process.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the process for preparing a polypeptide comprising L-tyrosine, L-alanine, L-glutamate and L-lysine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, comprises treating a protected polypeptide with an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to form a polypeptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the process comprises:<br>
(a)1 polymerizing a mixture of A/-carboxyanhydride of L-tyrosine, A/-carboxyanhydride. of L-alanine, /V-carboxyanhydride of a protected L-glutamate and A/-carboxyanhydride of a protected L-lysine, in a polar aprotic solvent in the presence of an initiator, to form a protected polypeptide; and<br>
(b)1 adding an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to the protected polypeptide formed in Step (a)1 to form a polypeptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the process comprises:<br>
(a)1 polymerizing a mixture of A/-carboxyanhydride of L-tyrosine, /V-carboxyanhydride of L-alanine, A/-carboxyanhydride of a y-benzyl L-glutamate L-glutamate and W-carboxyanhydride of Ne-trifluoroacetyl L-lysine, in a polar aprotic solvent in the presence of an initiator, to form a protected glatiramer;<br>
(b)1' adding an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to the protected glatiramer formed in Step (a)1' to form a glatiramer; and<br>
(c)1' treating the glatiramer with acetic acid to form glatiramer acetate.<br>
In the deprotecting steps, Step (b)1 and Step (b)1', of the process of the invention, an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is added to the protected polypeptide formed in Step (a)1 or to the protected glatiramer formed in Step (a)1'. In Step (b)1 and Step (b)1', the protecting groups on the glutamic acid moiety, i.e., the y-benzyl group, and the protecting groups on the lysine moiety, i.e., Af-trifluoroacetyl group, are removed. In addition, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide cleaves the amide bonds of the polypeptide or glatiramer forming heterogenous polypeptide or glatiramer fragments.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the present inventors believe that the removal of the protecting groups from the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer results in a phase transfer of the deprotected polypeptide or deprotected glatiramer from the organic phase to the aqueous phase.<br>
In the absence of a buffer in Step (b)1 or Step (b)1',. the pH during Step (b)1 and Step (b)1', is generally about 13 to about 14 after the addition of the aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. In the presence of a buffer in Step (b)1 or Step (b)1', the pH is generally about 8 to about 12. The buffer may be added or formed in situ. A preferred buffer is an acetate buffer such as sodium acetate.<br>
The alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is preferably selected from calcium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. More preferably, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide. A combination of alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides may also be used.<br>
The alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is preferably present in an amount of from about 0.1 wt. % to about 400 wt. %, more preferably from about 10 wt. % to about 300 wt. %, based on the weight of the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer. Most preferably, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is present in an amount of from about 140 wt. % to about 260 wt. %, based on the weight of the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer.<br>
An aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is added to the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer preferably at a temperature of from about -78°C to about 40°C, more preferably -25°C to about 30°C, for a period of time preferably from about 1 hour to about 30 hours. Most preferably, an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is added to the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer at a temperature from about -10°C to about 10°C, e.g., 0°C, for a period of from about 1 hour to about 8 hours, with stirring. The addition of an aqueous solution of an alkali or alkaline<br>
earth metal hydroxide results in a phase separation wherein an organic phase and an aqueous phase are formed.<br>
The organic phase substantially contains the polar aprotic solvent and the protected polypeptide or protected glatiramer. The aqueous phase substantially contains water, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and the deprotected polypeptide or deprotected glatiramer in the form of a free base. The aqueous phase and the organic phase are preferably separated by using a centrifuge and decanting the organic phase.<br>
An additional advantage of the process of the invention is that the addition of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide causes deprotection of the protected polypeptide to form a deprotected polypeptide, or deprotection of the protected glatiramer to form a deprotected glatiramer.. In addition, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide causes cleavage of the amide bonds in the deprotected polypeptide or deprotected glatiramer to form polypeptide or glatiramer fragments.<br>
The aqueous phase is preferably treated with an organic or mineral acid to achieve a pH of about 7 to about 8, Such organic or mineral acids to adjust the pH are well-known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, formic acid, oxalic acid and hydrochloric acid. Dilute hydrochloric acid is preferred. The amount of organic or mineral acid used is preferably an equivalent amount based on the amount of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide added during Step (b)1 or Step (b)1' which is sufficient to produce a pH of about 7 to about 8.<br>
Undesired low molecular weight polypeptide or glatiramer fragments, i.e., less than about 2 kDa, and high molecular weight polypeptide or glatiramer fragments, I.e., greater than about 40 kDa, are preferably removed by such methods as dialysis or diafiltration. Preferred membranes include Visking partially permeable cellulose membranes such as a Size 6 membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 12-14 kDa, available from Medicell International Ltd., and tangential flow filtration (TFF) membranes, such as a Pellicon XL PLCCC 10 (50 cm2) or PLCCC 5 (50 cm2), available from Millipore. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the deprotected polypeptide or deprotected glatiramer is subjected to dialysis in water, followed by dialysis in aqueous acetic acid solution.<br>
