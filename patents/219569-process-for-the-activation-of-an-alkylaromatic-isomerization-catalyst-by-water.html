				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for isomerization of alkyiaromatics. The xylenss, i.e., para-xyiene, metaxylene and orthoxylene, are important Intermediates which find wide and varied application in chemical synthesis. Para-xylene upon oxidation yields terephthalic acid which is used in the manufacture of synthetic textile fibers and resins. Metaxylene is used in the manufacture of plasticizers, azo dyes, wood preservers, etc. Orthoxylene is feedstock for phthalic anhydride production.<br>
Xylene isomers from catalytic reforming or other sources generally do not match demand proportions as chemical intermediates, and further contain ethylbenzene which is difficult to separate or convert. Para-xylene amounts to only 20-25% of a typical CB aromatics stream. Combining xylene-recovery, such as adsorption for para-xylene recovery, with isomerization can effect adjustment in the additional quantity of the desired isomer. Isomerization converts a non-equilibriurn mixture of the xylene isomers which is lean in desired components to a mixture approaching equilibrium concentrations.<br>
An increasingly close approach to equilibrium of C6 aromatic isomers in an isomerization process is associated with higher losses of C8 aromatics to other hycroc&amp;rbons. A close approach to equilibrium minimizes the amount of recycle to para-xylene recovery, and thus reduces the investment and operating costs of the complex. A lower loss of CB aromatics reduces feedstock requirements and increases the proportion of higher-value products. The performance of an<br>
isomerization process is determined principally by the interrelationship of conversion, C8 aromatic losses and catalyst stability. The operating temperature required to achieve a given conversion is an indicator of such performance, since higher temperatures generally result in higher losses to byproducts and mere rapid catalyst deactivation.<br>
Ethylbenzene is not easily isomerized to xylenes, but it normally must oe reacted because separation from the xyienes by superfractionation or adsorption is very expensive. Modern approaches to C8 aromatics isomerization include reaction of the ethylbenzene in the presence of a solid acid catalyst with a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function to effect hydrogenation to a naphthene intermediate followed by dehydrogenation to form a xylene mixture. Another approach is to convert ethylbenzene via dealkylation to form principally benzene while isomerizing xylenes to a near-equilibrium mixture. The former approach enhances xylene yield by forming xylenes from ethylbenzene, but the latter approach commonly effects higher ethylbenzene conversion and thus lowers the quantity of recycle to the para-xylene recovery unit with a concomitant reduction in processing cost. The latter approach also yields a high-quality benzene product.<br>
In the isomerization art relating to combination schemes, in which the isomerization process is disclosed in the context of product recovery technology, there is a strong implication that the isomerization feed will be dry. US-A-3,856,872, US-A-4,218,573 and Re 31,782 disclose various flow schemes including a crystallizer providing feedstock to the isomerization process, •! is known in the art that a crystallizer recovering para-xylene must be a dry operation, and the raffinate from the crystallizer to the 'isomerization process thus will be cry.<br>
US-A-4,584423       discloses   prefractionation    and    crystallization    prior   to isomerization, and both steps would remove water from the isomerization feed.<br>
JS-A-4,300,013, on the other hand, discloses the addition of large quantities of water (0.05-1.0 wt.%) in an alkylbenzene isomerization process based on zeolite FU-1. US-A-4,723,050 also discloses the supply of large quantities of water (0.1-10 wt.%) to an isomerization process based on the idea that steam is beiieved to reduce catalyst coking due to sulfur.<br>
U.K. Patent Specification 1,255,459 discloses steam addition in an amount ranging from 100 to 1500 pprn for an xylene isomerization process. Hart et al. discloses ethylbenzene isomerization to xylenes through naphthenes using a catalyst based on an acidic refractory oxide containing a mixture of silica and alumina. Also disclosed is the use of zeolitic aluminosilicates such as faujasite (FAU).<br>
German Patent DD-219,183 (Doms et al.) discloses a mordenite (MOR) based catalyst contacted with NH3, where the selectivity of ethylbenzene isomerization is improved by the addition of 500 to 800 ppm water in the initial reaction period up to a running time of 300 hours followed by reduction of the water content to the range of 10 to 50 ppm.<br>
Other disclosures of the art include US-A-3,381,048 and US-A-3,898,297 both cf which are based on amorphous catalyst systems. Lovell et al. disclose for a xylene isomerization process based on a platinum-alumina-halogen catalyst svstem that process conditions be controlled so that water content is dry on the order of 20 to 200 wt-ppm during reaction and wet on the order of 0.3 to 2.0 wt% during regeneration. Sampson et al. disclose an alkyl benzene isomerization<br>
process based on fluorided variations of amorphous aluminas or silica/aluminas optionally containing alkali or alkaline earth metals in the presence of steam in the range of 0.005 to 1.0 wt%.<br>
US-A-4,431,857 discloses the use of crystalline borosiiicate (AMS-13) impregnated with molybdenum and the use of water addition to favor A10 formation via a disproportionation mechanism.<br>
US-A-5,773,679 discloses the co-feeding of water during the initial operation of selectivated ZSM type zeolites for hydrocarbon conversion, and the use of silicon treated ZSM-5 for toluene disproportionation in particular. The effect of this zeolite treatment is to increase para-selectivity of the catalyst by decreasing the yield of xylenes, with the total xylenes decreasing a greater amount than the para-isomer such that the relative ratio of para-xylene increases, and with the resultant balance showing increased yield of benzene. No effect on ethyl-benzene conversion is shown.<br>
Nothing in the prior art suggests the use of trace quantities of water injection during alkylaromatic isomerization reaction conditions with non-zeolitic molecular sieve containing catalysts in order to effect improved or reactivated catalyst performance while maintaining the presence of hydrocarbon material In the system. Further, the need to improve the use selected pentasil zeolitic aluminosiiicate containing catalysts that have not been silicon selectivated and where the water injection may be provided continuously or intermittently to promote favorable ethylbenzene conversion also is addressed by the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In summary, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the isomerization of xylenes and conversion of ethylbenzene.<br>
This invention is based on the discovery that injection of trace amounts of water or a water producing compound into the reactor zone of a Ca aromatics isomerization process results in a surprising improvement in ethylbenzene conversion and para-xylene yield at given reactor temperatures, along with improved catalyst stability.<br>
A broad embodiment of the present invention is a process for the upgrading of a nonequilibrium CB aromaiics feed mixture wherein water or a water forming compound is supplied continuously or intermittently to a reaction zone containing a catalyst comprising either a non-zeolitic molecular sieve or a pentasil zeolitic alurninosilicate in order to increase xylenes isomerization and ethylbenzene conversion at a given temperature.<br>
In a specific embodiment the catalyst further comprises at least one platinum-group metal component, arid an inorganic-oxide binder. The equivalent water provided to the reaction zone corresponds to 75 to 750 mass ppm, or preferably corresponds to 100 to 500 mass ppm.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure i compares the product ratio of para-xylene in total xylenes relative to reaction temperature when converting ethylbenzene in conjunction with xylene isomerization with and without the provision of a trace quantity of water to the reaction zone. Figure II compares ethylbenzene dealkylation as a function of<br>
temperature to show the effect of trace water addition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A feedstock to the present process comprises alkylaromatic hydrocarbons of the general formula C6H(MRn, where n is an integer from 2 to 5 and R is CH3, C2H5, C3H7, or C4H9, in any combination and including ail the isomers thereof, Preferred isomerizable alkylaromatic hydrocarbons include the xyiene isomers in admixture with ethylbenzene as a nonequilibrium mixture.<br>
The present process effects conversion of C2H5, C3H7, and higher R groups on aromatic rings via dealkylation in conjunction with isomerization of methyl side chains on aromatic rings to approach a near-equilibrium isomer distribution in tne aromatics product from the process.<br>
The alkylaromatic hydrocarbon feedstock may be utilized as tonne in selected fractions from various refinery petroleum streams, e.g., as recovered from catalytic reformate by fractionation or solvent extraction, produced as a byproduct of pyrolysis of petroleum distillates to obtain principally light olefins, or recovered from cracking of heavy petroleum fractions principally to gasoline-range products. An especially preferred feedstock is the raffinate after recovery of one or more valuable C8 aromatic isomers, e.g., the recovery of para-xylene by adsorption or crystallization and/or the recovery of orthoxyiene by fractionation. Usually the feedstock will be substantially sulfur-free, generally containing lass than 1 mass ppm sulfur due to prior catalytic processing. The isomerizable aromatic hydrocarbons which are converted in the process of this invention need not be concentrated. By increasing the yield of valuable petrochemical<br>
intermediates from streams which otherwise could command only fuel value, the profitability of such petrochemical operations can be enhanced.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, an alkylaromatic hydrocarbon feedstock, preferably in admixture with hydrogen, is contacted with a cataiyst of the type hereinafter described in a reaction zone. Contacting may be effected using the catalyst in a fixed-bed system, a moving-bed system, a flutdized-bed system, or in a batch-type operation. In view of the danger of attrition loss of the valuable cataiyst and of operational advantages, it is preferred to use a fixed-bed system. In this system, a hydrogen-rich gas and the feedstock are preheated by suitable heating means to the desired reaction temperature and the combined reactants then pass into a reaction zone containing a fixed bed of the catalyst. The reaction zone may be one or more separate reactors with suitable means therebetween to ensure that the desired isomerization temperature is maintained at the entrance to each reactor. It is to be noted that the reagtants may be contacted with the catalyst bed in either upward, downward, or radial-flow fashion, and that the reactants may be in the liquid phase, a mixed [squid-vapor phase, or a vapor phase when contacted with the catalyst.<br>
Operating conditions in the reaction zone include a temperature in the range from 0° to 600°C and a pressure from atmospheric to 5 MPa. Preferably, a temperature range of 300° to 500°C and a pressure range of 1 to 50 atmospheres is employed. The liquid hourly hydrocarbon space velocity of the feedstock relative to the volume of catalyst is from 0.1 to 30 hr-1, and most preferably at 0.5 10 15 hr1. The hydrocarbon is passed into the reaction zone preferably in admixture with a gaseous hydrogen-containing stream at a hydrogen-to-<br>
hydrocarbon mole ratio of fron 0.5:1 to 15:1 or more, and preferably a ratio or from 0.5 to 10. Other inert diluonts such as nitrogen, argon, methane, ethane, and the like may be present.<br>
It is an essential aspect of the invention that trace quantities of water are supplied to the reaction zone of the present process. Trace quantities generaw will amount to no more than the water of saturation of the a iky I aromatic feedstock, or typically up to 750 mass ppm (parts per million) relative to the alkylaromatic hydrocarbons; since above this level, water is believed to affect the hydroihermai stability of the molecular-sieve catalyst. At least 75 mass ppm of water must ne supplied to have a significant effect on the process, and the most effective range of trace quantities is from 100 to 500 mass ppm relative to the aikylaromsiic hydrocarbons. .The water may be injected into the alkylaromatic feedstock or into the combined reactants to the reaction zone. Alternatively, the water may be supplied as steam in the hydrogen-containing stream.<br>
As will be apparent to the skilled artisan, other compounds besides water itself may be injected where such compounds wou!d effectively form water when provided to the reaction zone. While not intending to limit the invention, example water source compounds which form water in the reaction include but are not limited to alcohols, ethers, esters, etc. A preferred water source compound is methanol.<br>
The water source is continuously provided at the typical operating conditions in the reaction zone. Alternatively, the water source ;'s provided intermittently. The water source can be stopped or provided In various amounts depending on the performance required from the catalyst system in the reaction<br>
zone. One measure of catalyst performance is weighted average bed temperature (WABT). When the catalyst is operated to achieve a constant conversion of ethylbenzene, a resulting gradual deactivation requires compensatory WABT adjustment. When WABT becomes too high it can begin to become a limiting control variable based on equipment constraints such as heater duty. Therefore intermittent water injection in the range provided herein above can allow for an extra WABT operating margin to improve the operating cycle of a temperature constrained reactor. Depending on the nature of the feed mixture and the catalyst type and condition, the amount and effectiveness of the trace water will vary. Water already present in the feed as received from the feed source will aiso periodically require some adjustment to the amount of additional trace water supplied to the reaction zone.<br>
"he particular product recovery scheme employed is not deemed to be critical to the instant invention. Any recovery scheme known in the art may be used. Typically, the reactor effluent will be condensed with the hydrogen and light hydrocarbon components removed therefrom by flash separation. The condensed Liquid product is then subjected to a fractionation procedure to further purify the desired liquid product. Valuable high-purity benzene can be recovered from the iight liquid product. In some instances it may be desirable to recover certain oroduct species, such as orthoxylene, by more rigorous fractionation. In most instances a liquid C8 aromatics product is processed to selectively recover the cara-xylene isomer. Recovery of para-xylene can be performed by crystallization methods or most preferably by selective adsorption using crystalline afuminosilicates. The raffinate remaining after recovery of the desired xylene<br>
isomers may be returned to the isomerization reactor section.<br>

As noted previously, the present invention is drawn to a process for use in isomerization of C8 aromatics comprising a non-zeolitic molecular-sieve or zeoiltic aluminosiiicate catalyst. Having described the preferred NZMS catalyst embodiment above, the description of the alternate pentasii zeolitic aiuminosilicate catalyst embodiment follows below. A component of this catalyst of the presem: invention preferably comprises at least one pentasii zeolitic aiuminosilicate medium-pore molecular sieve. The term "medium-pore" refers to the pore size as determined by standard gravimetric adsorption techniques in the art of the referenced crystalline molecular sieve between what is recognized in the art as "large pore" and "small pore," see Flanigen et ai, in a paper entitled, Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves and the Periodic Table", published in {.&amp;<br>
"Mew Developments in Zeolite Science and Technology" Proceedings of the 7th International Zeolite Conference, edited by Y. Murakami, A. lijima and J. W. Ward, pages 103-712 (1986), Intermediate-pore crystalline molecular sieves have pore sizes between 0.4 nm and 0.8 nm, especially 0.6 nm. For the purposes of this invention, crystalline molecular sieves having pores between 5 and 6.5 A are defined as "medium-pore" molecular sieves.<br>
The; term "pentasil" of the preferred pentasil zeolite component is used to describe a class of shape-selective zeolites. This class of zeolites is typically characterized by a silica/alumina mole ratio of at least 12. Descriptions of the pentasils may be found in US-A-4,159,282; US-A-4,163,018; and US-A-4,278,565. Of the pentasi! zeolites, the preferred ones are MFI, MEL, MTW, MTT and PER (SUPAC Commission on Zeolite Nomenclature), with MFI-type zeolites, often identified as ZSM-5, being particularly preferred. It is a preferred embodiment of the present invention that the pentasil be in the hydrogen form. Conversion of an alkali rnetal form pentasil to the hydrogen form may be performed by treatment with an aqueous solution of a mineral acid. Alternatively, hydrogen ions can be incorporated into the pentasil by ion exchange with ammonium hydroxide followed by calcination.<br>
St is also within the scope of the present invention that the particular pentasii selected may be a gallosilicate. Gallosilicates have essentially the same structure as the preferred zeolites described hereinabove, except that all or part of •.tie aluminum atoms in the alurninosilicate crystal framework are replaced by gallium atoms. The gallium content for this particular type of pentasil, expressed .-.as rnoie ratios of SiO2 to Ga2O3, ranges from 20:1 to 400:1 or more.<br>

The proportion of NZMS in the first catalyst is 5 to 90 rnass-% ,, preferably 10 to 80 mass-%, the remainder other than metal and ov.her components discussed herein being the binder component. The relative proportion of zeolite in the second catalyst may range from 5 to 99 mass-%, with 10 to 90 mass-% being preferred.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that a catalytic composition can combine one or more NZMSs with each other or with crystalline zeoiitic aluminosilicates. Catalysts containing the more non-zeolitic molecular sieves and zeolitic aluminosilicates may be contained in separate reactors, arranged sequentially in the same reactor, mixed physically, or composited on the same particle.<br>
The binder utilized in the present invention, should be a porous, adsorpiive, high-surface area support having a surface area of 25 to 500 m2/g. Examples of binder materials which may be used in dual-functional hydrocarbon conversion catalysts include: (1) silica or silica gel, silicon carbide, clays and silicates including those synthetically prepared and naturally occurring, which may or may not be acid treated, such as, attapulgus clay, diatornaceous earth, fuller's earth, kaoiiir. kieselguhr, etc.; (2) ceramics, porcelain, bauxite; (3) refractory inorganic oxides such as alumina, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, chromium oxsde, zinc oxide, magnesia, thoria, boria, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, chromia-aiumina, alumina-boria, silica-zirconia, zirconia-alumina, etc.; and (4) combinations of one or more materials from one or more of these groups. Preferred binders are refractory<br>
inorganic oxides, such as a binder comprising alumina. Suitable aluminas are the crystalline aluminas known as the gamma-, eta-, and theta-aluminas, with gamma-alumina as the preferred form. The alumina binder may contain minor proportions of other well known refractory inorganic oxides such as silica, zirconia, magnesia, etc.; good results may be obtained with a binder containing from 90 to 99 mass-% alumina and from 1 to 10 mass-% zirconia. A preferred binder or matrix component is a phosphorus-containing alumina component. The phosphorus may be incorporated in any acceptable manner known in the art. US-A-4,629,717 describes one method of preparing such alumina phosphate.<br>
"The preferred alumina binder is uniform in composition. The alumina may be activated prior to use by one or more treatments including drying, calcination, steaming, etc., and it may be in a form known as activated alumina, activated alumina of commerce, porous alumina, alumina gel, etc.<br>
An alternative preferred binder is a form of amorphous silica. The preferred amorphous silica is a synthetic, white, amorphous silica (silicon dioxide) powder which is classified as wet-process, hydrated silica. Preferrably the BET surface area of the silica is in the range from 120 to 160 m2/g. Nonacidic amorphous silica binder is especially preferred e.g., that the pH of a 5% water suspension be 7 or above.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may be composited and shaped into any useful form such as spheres, pills, cakes, extrudates, powders, granules, tablets, etc., and utilized in any desired size. These shapes may be prepared by spray drying, tabletting, spherizing, extrusion, and nodulizing. A preferred shape for the catalyst composite is the extrudate. The extrudates may be further shaped<br>
to any desired form, such as spheres.<br>
An alternative preferred shape of the subject catalyst is a sphere, advantageously manufactured by the oil drop method which comprises forming a hydrosol of the desired inorganic oxide binder. Alumina hydrosol is preferably prepared by reacting aluminum metal with hydrochloric acid. The molecular sieve is then uniformly dispersed in the hydrosol. This resultant zeolite-containing hydrosol is then commingled with a suitable gelling agent and is dispersed as droplets into an oil bath maintained at elevated temperatures. The lead component may be added to the mixture prior to forming the droplets and either before, after, or simultaneously with the pentasil. The droplets of the mixture remain in the oil bath until they set and form hydrogel spheres.<br>
The zeolitic aluminosilicate catalyst optimally is subjected to steaming to tailor its acid activity. The steaming may be effected at any stage of the zeolite treatment, but usually is carried out on the composite of zeolite and binder prior to incorporation of the platinum-group metal. Steaming conditions comprise a water concentration of 5 to 100 volume-%, pressure of from 100 kPa to 2 MPa, and temperature of between 600° and 1200°C. The steaming should be carried out for a period of at least one hour, and periods of 6 to 48 hours are preferred. Alternatively or in addition to the steaming, the composite may be washed with one or more of a solution of ammonium nitrate, a mineral acid, and/or water.<br>
Another component of the present invention is one or more of the platinum-group metals, selected from platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. The preferred platinum-group metal component is platinum, with palladium being the next preferred metal. The platinum-group metal component<br>
may exist within the final catalyst composite as a compound such as an oxide, sulfide, halide. oxysulfide, etc., or as an elemental metal or in combination with one or more other ingredients of the catalyst. It is believed that the best results are obtained when substantially all the platinum-group metal component exists in a reduced state. The piatinurn-group metal component generally comprises from 0.01 to 2 mass % of the final catalytic composite, calculated on an elemental basis, Most preferably, the catalyst contains from 0.05 to 1 mass % platinum.<br>
The platinum-group-metal component may be incorporated into the catalyst composite in any suitable manner. One method of preparing the catalyst involves the utilization of a water-soluble, decomposable compound of a platinum-group metal to impregnate the calcined sieve/binder composite. Alternatively, a platinum-group metal compound may be added at the time of compositing the sieve component and binder. Complexes of platinum-group metals which may be employed in impregnating solutions, co-extruded with the sieve and binder, or added by other known methods include chloroplatinic acid, chloropalladic acid, ammonium chloropiatinate, bromoplatinic acid, platinum trichloride, platinum tetrachloride hydrate, platinum dichlorocarbonyl dichloride, tetramine platinic chloride, dinitrodiaminoplatinum, sodium tetranitroplatinate (II), palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, palladium sulfate, diamminepalladium (II) hydroxide, tetrarnminepalladium (II) chloride, and the like. Preferably the platinum-group metal component is concentrated on the binder component of the catalyst.<br>
Tie present catalyst composites may contain other metal components known to modify the effect of the platinum-group metal component. Such metal modifiers may include rhenium, tin, germanium, lead, cobalt, nickel, indium,<br>
gallium, zinc, uranium, dysprosium, thallium, and mixtures thereof, Cata effective amounts of such metal modifiers may be incorporated into the catalyst by any means known in the art to effect a homogeneous or stratified distribution. Trie optional metal modifier group component generally comprises from 0.01 to 5.0 mass % of the final catalytic composite.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may contain a halogen component comprising either fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine or mixtures thereof v/!ih chlorine being preferred. Preferably, however, the catalyst contains no added halogen other than that associated with other catalyst components,<br>
The catalyst composite is dried at a temperature of from 100° to 32C°C for a period of from 2 to 24 or more hours and, usually, calcined at a temperature of from 400° to 650°C in an air atmosphere for a period of from 0.1 to 10 hours until the metallic compounds present are converted substantially to the oxide form. The optional halogen component may be adjusted by including a halogen or halogen-containing compound in the air atmosphere to result in a final composite that contains from 0.1 to 2.0 mass % halogen, calculated on an elemental basis<br>
The resultant calcined composites optimally are subjected to a substantially water-free reduction step to insure a uniform and finely divided dispersion of the optional metallic components. The reduction optionally may be effected in ihe process equipment of the present invention. Substantially pure and dry hydrogen (i.e., less than 20 vol. ppm H20) preferably is used as the reducing agent in this step. The reducing agent contacts the catalyst at conditions, including a temperature of from 200° to 650°C and for a period of from 0.5 to 10 hours, effective to reduce substantially all of the Group VIII metal component to the<br>
metallic state. In some cases the resulting reduced catalyst composite may also be beneficially subjected to presulfiding to incorporate in the catalyst composite from C.05 to 1.0 mass-% sulfur calculated on an elemental basis.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
A catalyst (X) was prepared in accordance with the procedures described hereinabove in order to illustrate the advantages of the present invention. MFI zeolite was added to an alumina sol solution, prepared by digesting metallic aluminum in hydrochloric acid, in an amount sufficient to yield a zeolite content in the finished catalyst of 11 mass %. A second solution of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was prepared and added to the zeolite/alumina sol mixture to give a homogeneous admixture. This admixture was then dispersed as droplets into an oil bath maintained at 93°C, The droplets remained in the oil bath at 150°C until they set and formed hydrogel spheres, These spheres were removed from the oil bath, water washed with a 0.5% ammonia/water solution, air dried, and calcined at a temperature of 650°C. These calcined spheres were then co-impregnated with platinum and lead, using a solution of chloroplatinic acid, lead nitrate, and 2 mass % hydrochloric acid. The impregnated spheres were oxidized and chloride adjusted at 525°C, subjected to a reducing environment of H2 at 565°C, and sulfided with H,S to yield 0.07 mass % sulfur on the catalyst. The final catalyst consisted essentially of 11 mass % MFI zeolite, 0.21 mass % platinum, 0.67 mass % lead, and 0.78 mass % chloride with the remainder being alumina binder.<br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst X of Example 1 was evaluated for upgrading of C8 aromatics in a pilot plant. The feedstock composition was approximately as follows in mass<br>
benzene       0.1 toluene         0.6 para-xylene  3.6 metaxylene   68.1 orthoxylene   16.9 ethylbenzene10.3<br>
C9 hydrocarbons      0.4<br>
Feedstock was prepared by stripping in a fractionator and storing under' a dry (
The feedstock was processed in the pilot plant over a range or temperatures, varying pressure as described. The temperature survey on fresh catalyst was performed on a dry feedstock without water addition at a gas-io-hydrocarbon ratio of 3. A subsequent test at low temperature showed severe<br>
deactivaticn, and the tasting at dry conditions was discontinued. Trace quantities of water were added to the reactor feed to determine effect on catalyst performance. The inhial test and temperature survey showed improved results over even the fresh catalyst, and a one-week stability test at 435°C confirmed catalyst stability with trace water addition.<br>
Example 3<br>
The results of the temperature surveys and individual data points are plotted as Figures I and II. Figure i is a plot of the product ratio of para-xylene in total xylenes against reactor temperature. Figure II shows ethylbenzene conversion as a function of reactor temperature.<br>
Performance of the deactivated catalyst with trace water addition shows a significant benefit over the dry operation, and even over fresh catalyst at higher temperatures. Comparing the dry test (broken line between high temperature on fresh catalyst and return to iow temperature) with the test based on water addition, ihe provision of trace quantities of water on average lowered the temperature required to achieve a given para-xylene yield by 15-20°C, or alternatively improved the para-xylene content of the xylenes by nearly 3%. Ethylbenzene conversion was increased by 8-20% at the same temperature.<br>
A second catalyst (Y) was prepared in accordance with the procedures<br>
described hereinabove in order to illustrate the advantages of the present<br>
invention where water injection is provided intermittently.	SM-3<br>
sificoaluminophosphate was prepared in accordance with the teachings of US-A-<br>
4,943,424.    The SM-3 was composited with alumina and tetramine pistinic chloride. The composite comprised 60 mass-% SM-3 and 40 mass-% alumina. Tetramine platinic chloride was incorporated into the composition to effect a platinum level of 0.28 mass-% on an elemental basis, and the catalyst was calcined and reduced.<br>
This catalyst was tested in a pilot plant flow reactor processing a non-equilibrium C8-aromatic feed mixture having the following approximate composition in mass-%:<br>
C6 hydrocarbons	0.4<br>
toluene	0.8<br>
C7 non-aromatic hydrocarbons	0.4<br>
ethylbenzene	16.3<br>
para-xylene	0,2<br>
metaxylene	48.8<br>
orthoxylene	23.1<br>
C8 non-aromatic hydrocarbons	9.7<br>
C9 hydrocarbons	0.3<br>
This feed was contacted with 100 cc of catalyst at a liquid hourly space velocity of 3.0 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4. Reactor temperature was adjusted to maintain a favorable conversion level. Conversion is expressed as the disappearance per pass of ethylbenzene. Ce aromatic loss is primarily to<br>
benzene and toluene, with smaller amounts to light gases being produced. The feed containing initial low water at 25 mass-ppm up for the initial part of the experiment. Points 1a and 1b indicate the gradual decline in catalyst performance. The waterwas then increased to 300 mass-ppm for the middle part. Point 2 indicates the effect of water addition on improving catalyst performance. The final part of the experiment decreased water back to the initial level. Point 3 indicates the rejuvenation of the catalyst and its approach back to initial fresh performance. The above results may be summarized as follows:<br>
