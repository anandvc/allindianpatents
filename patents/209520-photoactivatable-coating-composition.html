PHOTOACTIVATABLE COATING COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to a photoactivatable coating composition comprising at least one photoinitiator and a base-catalysed polymerisable or curable organic material comprising at least one polyisocyanate and at least one compound comprising Isocyanate reactive groups, and to its use for the preparation of coatings with a rapidly processable surface at ambient temperature.<br>
Photoactivatable coating compositions of the type indicated above are known from, int. al., US-A-4,369,206. In this document use Is made of ammonium salts of a-ketocarboxylic acids as photoinitiator, and the photoactivatable coating compositions comprise polyurethane or epoxide resin precursors hardening in the presence of amines. A drawback to the known compositions is that they are only cured in places which are readily accessible to UV light. In the case of three-dimensional surfaces, or where the presence of pigments does not allow the UV radiation to penetrate into lower layers, the curing speed is too low.<br>
EP-A-0 898 202 discloses the photogeneration of amines from a-amino acetophenones as latent base catalyst in a base-catalysed coating composition. The curable systems only comprise organic compounds which are capable of reacting in a base-catalysed reaction or a condensation reaction. Specific mention is made of a (poly)alcohol and a (poly)isocyanate. In order to increase the curing speed In places which are not readily accessible to UV light, mention is made of the possible use of an additional unblocked base catalyst, which, however, requires the use of an additional thermal step.<br>
The invention now provides coating compositions which can be cured by UV radiation and have an acceptable curing speed at ambient temperature in places which are not readily accessible to UV light, which compositions comprise at least one photoinitiator and a base-catalysed polymerisable or<br><br>
curable organic material comprising at least one polyisocyanate and at least one compound comprising isocyanate reactive groups.<br>
The photoactivatable coating composition according to the invention is characterised in that the isocyanate reactive groups comprise at least one thiol group and the photoinitiator is a photolatent base.<br>
It should be added that photoactivatable coating compositions comprising a photoinitiator and a polymerisable or curable organic material consisting of a (poly)isocyanate and a compound comprising thiol groups are known from, int. al, EP-A-O 188 880. The coating layers produced with the coating compositions disclosed therein can be cured first by UV radiation and then, thoroughly, in a conventional manner at ambient temperature. A major drawback to the known coating compositions is the simultaneous presence of at least two entirety different curing mechanisms. One mechanism is based on the reaction between a multifunctional aikene and a multifunctional thiol, which requires UV radiation, whereas the secondary cure comprises a great many mechanisms such as the reaction of free isocyanate with water and the reaction of free isocyanate with the thiol component- One effect of this so-called dual cure system is that unexposed places will only be cured in part, resulting in an unreacted amount of aikene in the unexposed places. Therefore, in order to still achieve a minimum degree of curing in these places, use will have to be made of compounds having a higher functionality. Using such compounds has a viscosity increasing effect, which leads to a greater quantity of solvent being required to achieve a similar spraying viscosity, which Is attended with an increase in the VOC.<br>
A further advantage of the photoactivatable coating composition according to the invention is that when a photolatent base is used, it will remain active even after the exposure has ended.<br>
Suitable photolatent bases include N-substltuted 4-(o-nitrophenyl) dihydropy-ridines, optionally substituted with alkyl ether and/or alkyl ester groups, and<br><br>
quaternary organo-boron photoinitiators. An example of an N-substituted 4-{o-nitrophenyl) dihydropyridine is N-methyl nifedipine (Macromolecules 1998, 31, 4798), N-butyl nifedipine, N-butyl 2,6-dimethyl 4-{2-nitrophenyl) 1,4-dihydropy-ridine 3,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and a nifedipine according to the following formula<br><br>
i.e., N-methyl 2,6-dlmethyl 4-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl) 1,4-dihydropyridine 3,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester. Examples of quaternary organo-boron photoinitiators are disclosed in GB-A-2 307 473, such as<br><br>
Thus far optimum results have been obtained with a phototatent base belonging to the group of a-amino acetophenones. Examples of α -amino acetophenones which can be used in the photoactivatable coating compositions according to<br>
•<br>
the present invention are: 4-(methylthiobenzoyl)-1-methyl-1-morphollnoethane Orgacure® 907 ex Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and (4-morpholinobenzoyl)-1-<br>
benzyl-i-dlmethylamino propane (Irgacure 369 ex Ciba Specialty Chemicals) disclosed In EP-A-0 898 202. Preferred Is an α -amino acetophenone according to the following fonnula<br><br><br>
The photolatent base may be used in an amount of between 0.01 to 10 wt.% on solid curable material, preferably 0.05 to 5 wt.%, more preferably 0.05 to 3 wt.%.<br>
For most coating compositions wherein use is made of a photolatent base an acceptable balance between pot life and cure speed can be obtained by the incorporation of a certain amount of organic acid. Preference Is given in said case to an organic acid that is compatible with the other parts of the composition. Thus far optimum results have been obtained with dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid. The amount used thereof varies between 0.01 and 20 wt.%, based on the total weight of the coating composition, preferably 0.05 to 10 wt.%, more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt.%.<br>
Though irradiation of most of the a-amino acetophenones known from the literature results in the generation of an active catalyst, for some of them the unexposed places detract from the performance due to a too long curing time. Said problem may be overcome by Incorporating a very weak base and/or a metal compound into the composition.<br>
Generally, good results are obtained with metal complexes and/or metal salts which are known as such as catalysts for the isocyanate hydroxyl reaction. Preference is given in said case to metal complexes or metal salts wherein the metal is selected from the group of aluminium, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. These metals are complexed with carboxylate groups and/or diketones or alkylacetoacetates. Examples of satisfactory catalysts are disclosed in US-A-5,846,897. Thus far optimum results have been obtained with the aluminium complex K-KAT® XC5218 (ex King Industries) and with organic titanates such as titanium diisopropoxide bis-2,4(pentadionate) (Tyzor® AA ex DuPont). These catalysts may be used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 wt.% on solid curable material, preferably 1 to 5 wt.%.<br><br>
The coating compositions according to the invention are radiation curable after application and, optionally, evaporation of solvents. In particular, they are suitable for curing by irradiation with UV light. Combinations of IR/UV irradiation are also suitable. Radiation sources which may be used are those customary for UV, such as high- and medium-pressure mercury lamps. In order to avoid any risk involved in handling UV light of very short wave length (UV B and/or UV C light), preference is given, especially for use in automotive refinishing shops, to fluorescent lamps which produce the less injurious UV A light. However, the low intensity of the light produced by said lamps was found to have a detrimental effect on curing the known radically polymerised dual cure systems as a result of oxygen inhibition.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that when a photolatent base is used as the photoinitiator, more particularly when a sensitiser is also employed, there are no problems as a result of oxygen inhibition during Irradiation with UV light from fluorescent lamps.<br>
Suitable sensitisers are thioxanthones such as isopropyl thioxanthone according to the following fonnula<br><br>
(Quantacure® ITX ex G. Lakes), oxazines, and rhodamines. Colouriess suri'aces can be obtained with benzophenone and derivatives thereof. Examples of suitable derivatives of benzophenone are:<br><br><br>
wherein Ri, R2, and R3 may be the same or different and stand for CH3 or H (Speedcure® BEM ex Lambson),<br><br>
wherein R1, R2. and R3 may be the same or different and stand for CH3 or H (Esacure® TZTex Lamberti).<br>
The sensitiser may be present in amount of 0.1 to 5 wt % on solid curable material, preferably 0.5 to 2.5 wt.%.<br><br>
Examples of the isocyanate reactive compound comprising at least one thiol group include a thiol-functional compound comprising at least two thiol-functional groups and a compound comprising at least one thiol-functional group and one hydroxyl-functional group. Also mixtures of these compounds may be used in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Suitable thiol group-containing compounds are generally prepared by reacting hydroxyl group-containing compounds with thiol group-containing acids, such as 3-mercaptopropionlc   acid,   2-mercaptopropionic   acid,   thio-salicylic   acid, mercaptosuccinic acid, mercaptoacetic acid, or cysteine. Examples of suitable hydroxyl group-containing compounds are diols, triols, and tetrads, such as 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propane diol, 2-ethyl-2-propyl-1,3-propane diol, 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-cyclohexane diols, and the corresponding cyclohexane dimetiianol, 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, 1,2,3-trimethylol propane, and pentaerythritol. Examples of compounds prepared according to such a method include pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionate), pentaerythritol tetrakis (2-mercaptoacetate), trimethylol propane tris (3-mercaptopropionate), trimethylol propane tris (2-mercaptopropionate), and trimethylol propane tris (2-mercaptoacetate). Good results have been obtained with trimethylol propane tris    (3-mercapto    propionate)    and    pentaerythritol    tetrakis    (3-mercapto propionate).<br>
A further example of a compound prepared according to such a method consists of a hyperbranched polyol core based on a starter polyol, e.g., trimethylol propane, and dimethylol propionic acid. This polyol is subsequently esterified with 3-mercaptoproplonlc acid and isononanoic add. These methods are described in European patent application EP-A 0 448 224 and International patent application WO 93/17060.<br><br>

The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the current invention show particular utility as clear coats, base coats, pigmented top coats, primers, and fillers. Preferably, the coating composition according to the present invention may be used as clear coat or as primer. In a clear coat application, the use of α -amino acetophenone as photolatent base is preferred. In a primer application, the use of N-substltuted 4-(o-nitrophenyi) dihydropyridines as photolatent base is prefen'ed.<br><br>
The coating compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, bnjsh, or roller, spraying being prefenred. Curing temperatures preferably are between 0 and 100oC and more preferably between 20 and 60oC. The compositions are particularly suitable In the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles, and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes.<br>
In the case of the coating composition being a clear coat, the base coat may be a conventional base coat known in the coating art. Examples are solvent borne base coats, e.g., Autobase® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, based on cellulose acetobutyrate, acrylic resins, and melamine resins, and water borne base coats, e.g., Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, based on an acrylic resin dispersion and polyester resin. Furthemiore, the base coat may comprise pigments (colour pigments, metallics and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralising agent, and defoamers. Also high solids base coats can be used. These are, for instance, based on polyols, imines, and isocyanates. The clear coat composition is applied to the surface of a base coat and then cured. An intemiediate curing step for the base coat may be introduced.<br>
The invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples. Of course these examples are submitted for a better understanding of the invention only; they are not to be construed as limiting In any manner the scope thereof.<br><br>

Water resistance was measured by exposing the film to water for one hour. In the test results, 0 means that the film was totally dissolved, and 5 means that the film was not damaged at all.<br>
Example 1<br>
Prepared were five photoactivatable coating compositions each comprising a photolatent base selected from the group of N-methyl nifedipine (base 1), N-butyl 2,6-dimethyl 4-(2-nltrophenyl) 1,4-dihydropyridine 3.5-dlcarboxyiic acid diethyl ester (base 2) and Nnnethyl 2,6-dimethyl 4-(4.5-dimethoxy-2-nitro-phenyl) 1,4-dihydropyridine 3,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (base 3).<br><br>
The photoactivatable compositions A, B. C, D, and E comprised 56 parts by<br>
weight (pbw) of Desmodur® N3390 (an aliphatic trimer of hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate ex Bayer) and 27 pbw of trimethylol propane tris(3-mercapto<br>
propionate).<br>
The weight percentage of the photolatent base varied between 0.1 and 0.4.<br>
A 50 nm thiols film was drawn out onto a glass plate and exposed to UV A light<br>
(fluorescent lamps, type Cleo® ex Philips) at a distance of 10 cm (7 mW/cm^).<br>
The results of the experiments carried out at ambient temperature both in the<br>
dark and after 10 minutes' exposure are given in Table 1. The percentages<br>
quoted in the examples denote percentages by weight, and parts are parts by<br>
weight.<br><br>
According to the results mentioned in the above table, the time for curing. increases with decreasing nifedipine concentration. The pot life Is always acceptable, but curing in the dark detracts from the performance. However, It was found that if instead of curing in darkness the whole film was at least exposed to laboratory conditions, the curing time of the parts only exposed to light available under laboratory conditions was quite acceptable and varied between 25 to 100 minutes, depending on the type of photolatent base and its concentration.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated, with the proviso that the photolatent base used was 2 parts by weight (pbw) of a tetrabutyl ammonium borate according to the following formula:<br><br><br>
The photocurable compositions A and B comprised 50 pbw of Tolonate® HDT-LV (an aliphatic trimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate ex Rh6ne-Poulenc) and 27 pbw of trimethylol propane tris(3-mercapto propionate). Composition A contained 1 pbw of sensitiser Quantacure® ITX (ex G. Lakes). The results are mentioned in Table 2.<br><br>
According to the results mentioned in the above Table, In this case the presence of a sensitiser is a prerequisite for obtaining satisfactory results.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated, with the proviso that the photolatent base used was<br>
either 0.4 or 1.8 parts by weight (pbw) of an α -amino acetophenone, i.e. (4-<br>
morpholinobenzoyi)-1-benzyl-1-dimethylamino propane (Irgacure* 369 ex Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals).<br>
The photocurable compositions A, B, and C each comprised 50 pbw of<br>
Tolonate® HDT-LV (an aliphatic trimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate ex<br>
Rhone-Poulenc) and 27 pbw of trimethylol propane tris(3-mercapto propionate).<br><br>
Composition A contained 1.8 pbw of Irgacure® 369, composition B contained 0:4 pbw, and composition C contained 0.4 pbw and 0.1 pbw of dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid. The results are mentioned in Table 3.<br><br>
According to the results mentioned in Table 3, in this case the presence of a sulphonic acid makes for a considerable improvement of the pot life, whereas the curing times after exposure to UV A or under available light in the laboratory are hardly affected.<br>
Example 4<br>
Prepared were two photoactivatable coating compositions each comprising as a. photolatent base 1.1 parts by weight (pbw) of an α -amino acetophenone according to the formula:<br><br>
The composition as such is mentioned in Table 4.<br><br><br>
The pot life of composition A was 6 hours, whereas that of composition B, which<br>
contained an additional amount of a metal complex as catalyst, was 2 hours.<br>
A 75µm thick film was drawn out onto a glass plate and exposed to UV A light<br>
(fluorescent lamps, type Cleo® ex Philips) at a distance of 20 cm (3 mW/cm2).<br>
The unexposed films were cured after having been exposed to UV-A light for 1<br>
and 2 minutes, respectively, or not.<br>
The curing times data of the exposed and unexposed films is given in Table 5.<br><br>
According to the results mentioned in Table 5, in this case the presence of an additional catalyst has no or hardly any influence on the curing time of a film exposed to UV A light. However, dark curing was accelerated to a considerable extent from 330 to 75 minutes by the incorporation of an additional catalyst. The obtained films were examined for their resistance to methylethyl ketone and water. After 7 days the Persoz hardness was measured. The resistance to methylethyl ketone of the obtained coating layers is given in Table 6.<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
Example 1 was repeated, with the proviso that the photolatent base used was<br>
2,22 parts by weight (pbw) of an α-amino acetophenone according to the<br>
formula;<br><br><br>
In this example it is shown that not only the choice of a specific photoinitiator, and, depending on the type of photoinitiator, the additional use of an acid and/or base, but also the type of polyisocyanate can be an important parameter for obtaining a good balance between pot life and drying or curing in the dark. The pot life and curing conditions of 6 compositions are given In Table 9.<br><br>
From the results mentioned in Table 9 it appears that the use of Desmodur® N3400 is attended with a too short pot life, which can be restored by combining said Isocyanate with Tolonate® HDT-LV.<br>
Example 6<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the proviso that a coating composition comprising<br>
a physical mixture of a hydroxyl-functjonal resin and a thiol-functional resin was<br>
applied.<br>
A hydroxyl-functional acrylate, Setalux 1157 XS-54 ex Akzo Nobel Resins (Ew(OH) = 693 g, s.c. = 54%), was mixed with pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionate). Dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTL) was added as a catalyst for the NCO.eaction. The results are mentioned in Table 10.<br><br><br>
Example 7<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the proviso that a resin having both hydroxyl and<br>
thiol functionality prepared as follows was applied.<br>
In a first step a polyester was prepared from 31.05 pbw pentaerythritol, 1.55 pbw dipentaerythritol, 27,4 pbw hexahydrophthalic anhydride, and 10 pbw isononanoic add at 230oC under a nitrogen blanket with xylene refluxing to an acid value between 14 and 18 mg KOH/g solids. The reaction mixture was then cooled down to 180oC.<br>
In a second step, 30 pbw 3-mercapto propfonic acid were dosed to the reaction mixture at 180o'C under a nitrogen blanket with xylene refluxing. At a conversion of more than 75% a solution of tetra-isopropyl titanate in xylene was dosed (1.0 wt% tetra-isopropyl titanate on total solids). The esterification reaction was continued under reduced pressure until the acid value was 8 to 11 mg KOH/g solids. Subsequently, the xylene was distilled off under reduced pressure. The polyester dispersion was diluted with n-butyl acetate to a solids content of 75%. The resin solution was filtered over a pressure filter at 70 oC.<br><br>
A polyester resin having both hydroxy!- and thiol-functional groups was obtained with a solids content of 77.8% in butyi acetate, an Ew (OH) - 344, an Ew (SH)= 320, and an Av = 9.9.<br>
The results are mentioned in Table 11.<br><br>
The primer formulation was sprayed over a steel plate with a dry film thickness of ± 50µm. Just after spraying the film was irradiated with UV-A light (fluorescent lamps, type Cleo® ex Philips, distance 50 cm, 1 mW/cm2). The film<br><br>
was dry and ready to sand after 5 minutes. In the dark the drying took 2 hours. Two hours after mixing the results were still the same.<br>
Example 9<br><br>
The water borne formulation was applied with a drawing bar on a tin plate in a dry film thickness of 70 µm. After 1 hour of flash-off time the film was irradiated with UV-A light (fluorescent lamps, type Cleo® ex Philips, distance 10 cm, 7 mW/cm2). The film was dry after 2 minutes. In the dark the drying took another 6 hours. Two hours after mixing the results were still the same.<br>
Example 10<br>
Composition B of example 3 was applied to two metal panels coated with commercial available base coats, i.e. Autowave and Autobase ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV. the panels were exposed to UV A light (fluorescent lamps, type Cleo* ex Philips) at a distance of 10 cm (7 mW/cm2). The clear coats were dry after 1 minute.<br><br><br><br>
