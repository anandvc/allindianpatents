				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for damage detection for the rope sheath of a synthetic fiber rope according to the preamble to Claim 1.<br>
A synthetic fiber rope is a textile product made from rope threads of natural or chemical fibers, the rope being manufactured by twisting or otherwise forming, by laying in two or more stages with or without sheathing, or by braiding. The rope sheath protectively surrounds the rope structure of so-called synthetic fiber strands and, in the case of driven ropes, creates the necessary tractive capacity. It consists preferably of abrasion-resistant synthetic material, and is connected to the outermost layer of strands by adhesion and/or direct mechanical means. Either the rope sheath surrounds the rope in its entirety, or the outermost rope strands are each surrounded by a sheath of synthetic material and these together form the rope sheath. Especially when the ropes run over pulleys, and/or are driven, the rope sheath is subject to high abrasive wear.<br>
From the applicant's EP 0 731 209 Al a sheathed synthetic fiber rope is known as a suspension element for elevators. To ascertain the state of wear of the rope sheath on this driving rope, the rope sheath has different colors arranged coaxially. At an appropriate amount of wear of the sheath, the underlying color becomes visible, which is then taken to indicate the presence of advanced wear of the rope. This indication of damage has proved its value in relation to effects of wear in the rope sheath, but it is of only limited suitability for the reliable detection of localized damage due, for example, to unintentional contact with sharp edges or the like.<br><br>
The problem therefore presents itself of specifying a damage detection device for a rope sheath which reliably detects damage to the rope sheath irrespective of the cause of the damage. This problem is solved by means of the method having the characteristics stated in Patent Claim 1.<br>
Detection of damage according to the invention has various advantages. As a result of the breaking element inserted in the rope sheath, permanent monitoring of the rope sheath by measurement is possible. For this purpose, a signal is transmitted through the breaking element over a specific length of rope. If this connection is broken, the rope sheath has been damaged from outside. By monitoring in real time, visual inspection only becomes necessary when the monitoring device detects damage to the rope sheath.<br>
The breaking element can take the form of an electric conductor, an optical-fiber cable, or the like. Of importance for the selection of the conducting material used for this purpose is a fatigue strength under reverse bending stress which at least matches that of the rope construction so that material failure due to operation is ruled out.<br>
The breaking element can, for example, be constructed as an electric conductor in the form of a carbon fiber or metal wire through which a control signal is sent. If the conducting connection is cut off, no signal is transmitted, and this can be indicated in a suitable manner.<br>
In combination with a monitoring device, damage to the rope sheath can be detected by the control, and appropriate measures to ensure safe operation of the elevator can be initiated without delay.<br>
The conducting element is preferably wrapped round the entire rope, or the strands of the outer layer, and covered by the<br><br>
rope sheath, which is preferably applied by an extrusion process. Further, with an embodiment having a two-layered rope sheath; the breaking element can be positioned on the inner layer of the rope sheath and covered by the second layer of the rope sheath. In this way, the breaking element is completely embedded in the rope sheath and additional lateral forces acting on the synthetic fiber strands as the rope runs over pulleys are avoided.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, several breaking elements are embedded in the rope sheath around the rope parallel to the strands and/or in the direction of the length of the rope. This has the advantage of the rope sheath being monitored over practically its entire surface area with regard to mechanical damage taking place from outside.<br>
Furthermore, embodiments of the invention in which the conductor element is made from high strength material afford the additional advantage of strengthening or reinforcing the rope sheath. This can be used to improve the rope's fatigue strength under reverse bending stress as well as its abrasiv
 <br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a synthetic fiber rope comprising: a plurality of synthetic fiber strands forming a rope body having a length and an outer circumferential surface; a rope sheath covering said synthetic fiber strands along the length and about the outer circumferential surface; and at least one breaking element extending along the length of said rope body external of the outer circumferential surface and being covered by said rope sheath, said breaking element having a predetermined detectable characteristic whereby when said rope sheath is damaged sufficiently to break said breaking element, said predetermined detectable characteristic changes to indicate a presence of the damage to said rope sheath.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides an apparatus for controlling an elevator system in response to damage to a sheath of a synthetic fiber rope supporting an elevator comprising: a plurality of synthetic fiber strands forming a rope body having a length and an outer circumferential surface; a rope sheath covering said synthetic fiber strands along the length and about the outer circumferential surface, said rope body and said rope sheath forming a synthetic fiber rope; at least one breaking element extending along the length of said rope body extemal of the outer circumferential surface and being covered by said rope sheath, said breaking element having a predetermined detectable characteristic whereby when said rope sheath is damaged sufficiently to break said breaking element, said predetermined detectable characteristic changes to indicate a presence of the damage to said rope sheath; and a control circuit responsive to said change for generating a control signal for use by an elevator control to stop operation of an elevator car supported by said synthetic fiber rope.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides a method of detecting damage to a sheath of a synthetic fiber rope comprising the steps of: a) providing at least one breaking element extending along a length of and extemal to an outer circumferential surface of a rope body formed from a plurality of synthetic fiber strands; b) covering<br><br>
the rope body and the breaking element with a rope sheath; c) monitoring a predetermined detectable characteristic of the breaking element for a change indicating a presence of damage to the rope sheath; and d) generating a control signal upon detection of the change in the predetermined detectable characteristic.<br>
The invention is described in more detail below by reference to an example and the attached drawing. The drawing show:<br>
Figure 1 A multi-layered aramide fiber rope with a conducting element which is wound    helically round the rope and embedded in the rope sheath;<br>
Figure 2 A schematic diagram of a mounting circuit for the aramide fiber rope illustrated in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 A schematic diagram of a control circuit.<br>
The perspective drawing in Figure 1 shows the construction of a sheathed aramide fiber rope 1 of aramide fiber strands 2,<br><br>
which together with filler strands 3 are arranged in layers around a core 4, Positioned between an inner layer of strands 5 and an outermost layer of strands 6 is an antifriction intersheath 7 preferably having a contoured surface. The outermost layer of strands 6 is covered by the rope sheath 8, which is preferably of polyurethane or polyamide. Here, a copper wire 9 is wound helically round the outermost layer of strands 6 over the entire length of the rope with a gradient 10 of, for example, 1-4 turns per 60 mm length of rope. The rope sheath 8 is extruded onto the copper wire 9 so that the copper wire 9 is embedded in the rope sheath material and thereby covered.<br>
When several breaking elements are used these can, in principle, be arranged within the rope sheath in any desired manner on the rope provided that they create a connection for carrying signals over a specific length of rope and that mutual contact between the breaking elements through material of the rope sheath surrounding them is ruled out.<br>
Instead of being wound round the rope 1, the copper wire 9 can also be embedded in the rope sheath 8 parallel to the aramide fiber strands 2 of the outermost layer of strands 6, However, with such a parallel arrangement, it is expedient to distribute a large number of copper wires evenly over the circumference of the rope 1, so as to achieve monitoring of the rope sheath 8 over as nearly as possible its entire area. This arrangement is especially advantageous when the rope has a twisted or laid construction, because then the angle of lay causes the copper wires 9 - or conducting elements in general - to be at an angle to the direction of motion of the driven rope 1 with the result that an object, such as a sharp edge, rubbing along the length of the driven rope 1, unavoidably cuts through the copper wire or wires and this is immediately recognized as damage.<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates the monitoring by measurement of the aramide fiber rope shown in Figure 1. To check whether the conducting connection created by means of breaking element(s), here the copper wire 9, is intact over the length of the rope 10, or a specific section of the length, an electric voltage, for example in a monitoring circuit 11, can be applied to the two ends of the conducting element, A suitable source of voltage for this purpose is a battery 12 or a voltage generator. An ammeter 13 can then be used to detect whether a current is flowing through the copper wire 9 or not•<br>
Instead of the ammeter 13 a control lamp can be connected in the current circuit which, depending on how it is connected, is either illuminated or extinguished when damage occurs.<br>
Furthermore, damage to the rope sheath 8 can be detected with the aid of a control circuit 21 in the monitoring circuit 11. An example of a circuit suitable for this purpose has become known from EP 0 731 209 Al. In this known control circuit 21, which is illustrated in Figure 3, a constant current 15 is fed into the conducting element or elements 9 from a source of voltage 14 for which each transmission element 9 represents a resistance R1l to Rn. A low-pass filter 16 filters the incoming impulses and transmits them to a threshold switch 17. The threshold switch 17 compares the measured voltages. When certain limit values are exceeded, i.e. due to the transmission elements 9 being cut through, the resistance becomes so high that the allowable value of the voltage is exceeded. This exceeding of the limit value is stored in a non-volatile memory 18. This memory 18 can be deleted by means of a reset button 19, otherwise it passes on its information to a logic unit 20 which is connected to the elevator control.<br>
Each conducting element 9 is correspondingly connected by cables and permanently monitored. As soon as damage occurs,<br><br><br><br>
