The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FASTENING A CASING OF MULTI-TAP<br>
DISTRIBUTION APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of The Invention:<br>
5	The present invention relates to a method and a system for fastening a<br>
casing of a multi-tap distribution apparatus, and, more particularly, to a method and a system, with which a casing of a multi-tap distribution apparatus can be fastened automatically and accurately.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art:<br>
10	It has been years that the multi-tap distribution apparatus is adopted for a<br>
transmission of signal and/or power source. Presently, the cable television station popularly uses the multi-tap distribution apparatus as a relay transmitter to distribute the signal and/or the power source to each of the customers. Thus, the output line pairs (two lines form a pair) available on the multi-tap distribution apparatus means<br>
15 the maximum numbers of customers can be distributed by the multi-tap distribution apparatus.<br>
Although the multi-tap distribution apparatus can be fixedly attached to a public area inside a congregative house such as a multi-storied building or an apartment, it is possible for the multi-tap distribution apparatus to expose outdoor to 20 suffer the winds, the rains, the frosts, and the snow falls while the customers live in a community of scattered houses. In order to keep the circuit in the multi-tap distribution apparatus from damage such as being rusted or short circuit, it is necessary for the multi-tap distribution apparatus to be made with a complete seal and being free from seeped water.<br>
25	The multi-tap distribution apparatus basically is composed of a base being<br>
fastened together with an upper cover regardless it is the coaxial type or the single<br><br>
signal type. Except it is required that the multi-tap distribution apparatus has to be in a state of being sealed completely as it has been mentioned above, it is not allowed us to ignore the importance of a firm fastening for the casing of multi-tap distribution apparatus.<br>
5	Normally, the operation for fastening the casing of the multi-tap distribution<br>
apparatus is performed manually by way of screws being engaging to the casing with the air tool. Of course, it is fine that the manual work for a set of screws with a slow production, but it may generate a bottleneck resulting from delivering the work pieces, arranging the lead time and the operation time, and so on in case of multiple<br>
10 sets of screws being conducted by way of the manual operation. Moreover, under the circumstance of the labor cost getting higher and the automation being pursued eagerly, the manual operation becomes sarcasm to the present industrial technology.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15	An object of the present invention is to provide a method and a system for<br>
fastening a casing of a multi-tap distribution apparatus, which comprises a conveyer, and a screw fastened device to fasten the casing automatically with an endless chain moving in a cycle repeatedly such that an accurate and faster fastening job can be performed successfully.<br>
20     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention can be more fully understood by referencing to the following description and accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a multi-tap distribution apparatus;<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a conveyer disclosed in a system of the 25    present invention for fastening the casing of a multi-tap distribution apparatus; and<br><br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a screw fastened device in a system of the present invention for fastening the casing of a multi-tap distribution apparatus.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a multi-tap distribution apparatus shown is a 5 sophisticate one, which can transmit the signal and the power source simultaneously, so that it is necessary to be fastened with two times. For a simple multi-tap distribution apparatus with a signal transmission, it requires only to be fastened once. The sophisticate multi-tap distribution apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises a base A, a coaxial cover B, and a module cover of current distribution C. 10 The coaxial cover B has to be fastened to the base A first and then the module cover C is fastened to the coaxial cover B.<br>
In order to complete the fastening job, the system for fastening the multi-tap distribution apparatus according to the present invention comprises a conveyer 1, and at least a screw fastened device 2.<br>
15	Wherein, the conveyer 1 provides a flat work platform 11 and a plurality of<br>
locating plates 12 disposed above the work platform 11. The locating plates 12 are spaced to each other equally and a locating base 13 is disposed on each locating plate 12 and fixedly attached to the locating plate 12 respectively. The respective locating plate 12 at the inner side thereof is fixed to a movable endless chain 14.<br>
20	Further, the work platform 11 is provided with a flat surface for work and<br>
the work platform at the inner side thereof provides several sprockets 111 meshes with the chain 14. The sprockets 111 driven by a motor with a reduction speed so that the endless chain 14 can be actuated to move in a cycle repeatedly.<br>
Because the locating plates 12 at the inner sides thereof are fixed to the<br>
25    top of the endless chain 14 by way of fixing pins so as to move along with the<br>
endless chain. The locating plate 12 at the outer side thereof provides plate wheels<br><br>
121 in addition to the locating base 13 being fixedly attached to the upper surface thereof such that the locating plates 12 can move smoothly with the endless chain.<br>
The locating base 13 is provided to correspond to the contour of the multi-tap distribution apparatus so that there are different shapes for the locating base 13 5    based on different multi-tap distribution apparatus. The locating base 13 is fixedly attached to the locating plate 12 so as to be placed by the multi-tap distribution apparatus.<br>
The endless chain 14 meshes with the sprockets 111 so that the endless chain 14 can be driven to move in a cycle repeatedly as mentioned above.<br>
10	The screw fastened device 2 is disposed above the work platform 11 and<br>
strides the work platform 11. The screw fastened device 2 further comprises a frame 21, a press rod 22, a plurality of air tools 23, and a detector 24.<br>
Wherein, the frame 21 is fixedly attached to the work platform 11 and provides four legs 211 and a top plate 212 thereof for supporting other components 15    of the screw fastened device 2.<br>
The press rod 21 is possible to move upward and downward and the<br>
purpose thereof is to press and retain the upper cover of the multi-tap distribution<br>
apparatus so as to locate the multi-tap distribution apparatus well. The upward and<br>
the downward movements of the press rod 21 can be done by way of a conventional<br>
20    hydraulic or air cylinder so that no detail will be described further.<br>
The air tools 23 are used for fastening the screws to the casing of the<br>
respective multi-tap distribution apparatus so that the amount and the specification<br>
thereof, and even the fastened length into the casing are corresponding to the<br>
fastened screws on the multi-tap distribution apparatus. The air tools 23 connect<br>
25    with a compressor via air tubes so that the work of fastening can be done quickly.<br>
The detector 24 is used for detecting and starting the operation of fastening so that it can be disposed at the front or the rear sides of the frame 21. The detector<br><br>
24 shown in Fig. 3 is a shading type of detector and the detector can emit a signal as soon as a light beam sent from one side is blocked and a receiver at an opposite side thereof cannot receive the light beam. The detector is operated by way of a programmable control and, in addition, the programmable control is performed by 5 way of a controller to control the motor driving the chain 14, and the compressor driving the press rod 22. These are belonged to the prior art so that no detail will be described.<br>
Referring to Figs 1 to 3 again, while the system for fastening a casing of the multi-tap distribution apparatus is in operation, a unfastened multi-tap distribution<br>
10 apparatus with the lower base A having been closed with the cover (B or C) and being attached with threaded rods is located in place and the cycling chain 14 is actuated to move around. Then, the unfastened multi-tap distribution apparatus moves along with the chain 14 to the frame 21 and the detector 24 can emit a signal as soon as the unfastened multi-tap distribution apparatus has been detected. At<br>
15 this time, the press rod 22 moves downward to press the cover (B or C) and the air tools also descends to fit with the screws such that the air tools 23 start to turn and fasten the screws for a preset time or till the air supply is out. In this way, the fastening job is completed. The press rod 22 and the detector 24 ascend as soon as the fastening job is finished. The chain 14 further moves to send next unfastened<br>
20 multi-tap distribution apparatus in the frame 21 and the procedure of fastening job is performed once more. If the detector 24 is disposed at the front side of the frame 21, the detector 24 may emit a signal again during the unfastened multi-tap distribution apparatus passing over the detector 24. The detector 24 being disposed at the front side of the frame 21 or at the rear side of the frame 21 is an equivalent<br>
25    way for the reset of the programmable control.<br>
For a single cover B system, a set of screw fastened device 2 is enough,<br>
and for double covers (B and C), two sets of screw fastened devices 2 can be<br>
provided for fastening the screws at different portions of the casing of the multi-tap<br>
distribution apparatus. It is noted that the moving principle for the single cover can<br>
30    be applied for fastening double covers basically.<br><br>
It is appreciated from the preceding description that the present invention can provides a fastening job automatically so that a control of production quantity, a uniform quality of fastening, and a reduction of labor cost can be achieved effectively.<br>
5	While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred<br>
