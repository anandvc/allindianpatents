				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a vessel for mixing a cell suspension and/or a cell lysate. The invention also relates to a method of using the vessel to mix a cell lysate in order to obtain high-purity products such as nucleic acids or proteins for use in a variety of applications.<br>
The alkaline lysis of bacterial cells is a well-established laboratory technique for recovering plasmid DNA from host cells (Birnboim et a/., Methods Ensymol. 100. 243-255, 1983). The method involves the addition of a detergent, usually sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and sodium hydroxide to a bacterial cell suspension followed by the addition of a strong neutralising solution, usually potassium acetate or glacial acetic acid, after a short period of incubation. This results in a solution containing large aggregates, also referred to as floes, comprising denatured chromosomal DNA, protein, cell wall and/or membrane material. The floes are removed from the solution by coarse filtration or centrifugation, leaving a solution containing plasmid DNA that can be further purified by a variety of standard procedures.<br>
The method is based firstly on the chemical breakage of cell walls and membranes, followed by the solubilization and denaturtion of cellular components in an alkaline solution. The ability of plasmid DNA to renature upon neutralisation and chromosomal DNA's inability to do likewise enables the isolation of plasmid DNA.<br>
The method of alkaline lysis and the properties of the solutions produced at various stages of the alkaline lysis method have previously only been of academic interest. However, with the advent of human gene therapy, utilizing plasmid DNA obtained from host cells such as E.coli, there is now a requirement for the production of large quantities of very high purity plasmid DNA. The requirement of such large-scale manufacture has increased the need for new techniques so that the scale and robustness of operations can be increased to the level and standard required.<br>
Chromosomal DNA is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is known to possess viscoelastic properties, which have previously been utilized to determine the size of the DNA molecules (Chase, et al, Biophys. J. 28, 93-105, 1979). The viscoelastic properties have also been recognized when the process of alkaline lysis has been used to isolate plasmid DNA from bacteria (Nienow, AIChE Annual Meeting, November 1998, Florida USA). One feature of the process is the change in the rheological properties of the solution at various stages of the procedure. Studies of<br>
these Theological properties have shown that the initial cell suspension exhibits Newtonian characteristics. The characteristics of a Newtonian fluid can be summarised by three criteria (1) constant viscosity, and when a fluid flows under laminar conditions: (2) shear stress is directly proportional to shear rate, and (3) the only stress generated is shear stress (Barnes et al, Introduction to Rheology, 1989 and Ciccolini et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 60, 768-770, 1998). Cell suspensions have been found to have a viscosity that is very nearly constant, with a value very similar to that of water i.e. less than 3niPa (Ciccolini et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 60, 768-770, 1998). When the alkaline detergent solution is added, the properties of the solution change dramatically to give a solution that has a shear-dependent, relatively low apparent viscosity with a maximum value of about 22 mPas at a shear rate of 350 s"1 when a solution of about 120g wet cell weight I"1 is lysed. Despite the solution's low apparent viscosity, it is highly viscoelastic and gives a large Weissenburg effect. The Weissenburg effect is also known as "rod climbing" and is defined as the effect created when a shaft or rod rotates in a viscoelastic solution (Barnes et al., Introduction to Rheology, 1989). A Newtonian fluid would be forced toward the outer sides of a vessel by inertia, whereas an elastic fluid climbs up the shaft as a direct consequence of the normal stress (a characteristic of a viscoelastic fluid) which acts like a hoop around the shaft. The viscoelastic properties of the lysate solution have been characterised using a rheometer operated under the oscillatory mode. The phase angle of the solution was found to be 58°, wherein 0° represents a solid and 90° represents an inelastic fluid. This demonstrates the elastic properties of the solution. The relatively low apparent viscosity in combination with viscoelasticity is very unusual as most viscoelastic fluids also exhibit high apparent viscosities. On neutralisation, the viscoelasticity of the solution breaks down so that it once again becomes of low viscosity, close to that of water, with no signs of viscoelasticity.<br>
Whilst acting as a critical step in the recovery and purification of plasmid DNA, the lysis and neutralisation step have the potential for generating additional contaminants such as small fragments of chromosomal DNA and irreversibly denatured plasmid DNA.<br>
The problems are, at least partially, pH and time-related, specifically with respect to the period for which the plasmid DNA can be incubated in the alkaline detergent solution. Extended exposure to the concentrated alkaline solution may result<br>
At the laboratory scale, the process of alkaline lysis is achieved by "gentle mixing" such as the inversion of a test tube or bottle. This technique is clearly limited in scale and subject to operator influence. However, some companies do carry out this operation using volumes of up to 5 1 (Oral Presentation by Schleef M., Bio-Europe 1997, Cambridge, England, 1997).<br>
If plasmid DNA or other desired cell derived products are to be generated in a pure form suitable for clinical trials, a scaleable method of carrying out mixing during the lysis procedure is required to overcome the problems detailed above.<br>
Methods using static mixers have been described in, for example, International patent application WO 97/23601 but do not address the problems of plasmid quality, yield and purity.<br>
General discussions of methods for mixing solutions in vessels during the lysis process have been made by Marquet et al., (Bio Pharm, September, 26-37, 1995), but do not provide any description or data of a system that addresses the problems detailed above.<br>
The terms "mixing" and "agitate" as used herein refer to the mixing of the contents of the vessel of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a vessel for mixing a cell suspension and/or a cell lysate containing chromosomal DNA and a desired product, wherein the vessel comprises:<br>
(a)	one or more low power number impellers positioned so that the impeller<br>
or impellers give even dissipation of energy throughout the contents of the vessel;<br>
(b)	one or more feedlines enabling the addition of fluids to a well-mixed<br>
zone formed around the distal end of one or more of the impellers; and<br>
(c)	one or more baffles spaced substantially equally around the inner surface<br>
of the vessel, wherein the one or more baffles extend substantially parallel to the axis of<br>
rotation of the or each impellers.<br>
Even dissipation of energy throughout the contents of the vessel achieves homogeneous mixing of the vessel contents.<br>
The desired product can be'a protein. It is well known to those skilled in the art that proteins can be isolated from cell cultures and suitable chemical extraction procedures are described in Falconer el al., (Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 53, 453-458, 1997); Falconer et al, (Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 57, 381-386,<br>
in the formation of denatured plasmid DNA (Birnboim &amp; Doly, Nuc.Acids.Res., 7, 1513, 1979 and International Patent Application WO 97/29190). Denatured plasmid DNA cannot be readily purified from renatured plasmid DNA and its presence therefore leads to significant loss of functional plasmid yield. It is therefore important that mixing is sufficiently vigorous to ensure localised extremes of pH are avoided and that exposures to these conditions are minimised.<br>
If mixing is too vigorous at any stage of the procedure, strands of chromosomal DNA are physically broken up. The chromosomal DNA may be fragmented to a size where the fragments may renature upon neutralisation and be carried forward into the recovery and purification procedure. The fragmented chromosomal DNA will contaminate the solution and create a significant purification problem as it has similar properties to plasmid DNA and cannot be readily separated by techniques such as chromatography to the level required by regulatory authorities responsible for clinical products. Also, if the mixing is vigorous during neutralisation, the floes formed become too small, due to mechanical stress and cannot be readily removed by centrifugation or filtration.<br>
Clearly, any mixing process must be able to achieve rapid mixing without creating unwanted chemical or mechanical damage to the plasmid DNA, in addition limiting the mechanical damage to the chromosomal DNA and ideally without creating mechanical damage of the flocculated material. Similar problems occur when isolating proteins form cell cultures.<br>
During the process, significant volume changes occur. The alkaline detergent added to the cell suspension is usually equal to or double the volume of the initial suspension and the neutralisation solution is usually the same volume as that of the initial cell suspension. Consequently, the initial cell suspension may only represent 25% of the final volume to be mixed.<br>
Any mixing must take account of these changes in volume so that efficient mixing can be carried out over a wide range of volumes. In addition to this, and especially in systems where more than one impeller is in operation, steps are preferably taken in order to minimise air entrapment in the solution by impellers intersecting the air/liquid interface. Such entrapment may cause mechanical damage and fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA.<br>
1998); and Falconer et al, (Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 62, 455-460, 1998). Desired proteins include antibodies, cytokines hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, enzymes, clotting factors, apolipoproteins, receptors, drugs, oncogenes, tumor antigens, tumor suppressors, structural proteins, viral antigens, parasitic antigens and bacterial antigens. Specific examples of these proteins include proinsulin, growth hormone, dystrophin, androgen receptors, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor II, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, epidermal growth factor TGF-ot, TGF-P, PDGF, angiogenesis factors (acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and angiogenin), matrix proteins (Type IV collagen, Type VII collagen, laminin), phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, oncogenes (ras, fos, myc, erb, src, sis, jun), E6 or E7 transforming sequence, p53 protein, Rb gene product, cytokines (e.g. II-1, IL-6, EL-8) or their receptors, viral capsid protein, and proteins from viral, bacterial and parasitic organisms which can be used to induce an immunologic response, and other proteins of useful significance in the body.<br>
Preferably, however, the desired product is plasmid DNA.<br>
The term "vessel" as used herein means any receptacle capable of holding the cell suspension. The vessel may be of any shape suitable for mixing and is preferably cylindrical. Preferably, the vessel has a shallow rounded or dished bottom with a concave shaped internal wall. Alternatively, it is preferred that the vessel has a flat bottom. The vessel preferably is hermetically sealed and hermetically sealed vessels are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The vessel of the present invention has at least one rotatable axle for rotating the impellers and may have more than one rotatable axle. The use of two or more axles in fermentation and other mixing vessels is well known and is applicable to the presently claimed vessel. Preferably, however, the vessel has one axle.<br>
The term "a cell suspension" as used herein means a medium comprising cells. The term "lysate" as used herein refers to a medium wherein cells have been lysed.<br>
The cells may be any cells capable of growth or maintenance in a medium and include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Preferably, the cells are bacterial cells such as E.coli, mammalian cells such as HeLa cells, CHO cells and myeloma cell lines, and insect cells. Most preferably, the cells are prokaryotic cells or lower eukaryotic cells such as yeasts. The cells may be present on microcarrier beads. Suitable microcarrier beads for culturing cells are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The term "chromosomal DNA" is used herein to indicate DNA that forms part of the chromosome of a cell or a fragment thereof.<br>
The term "plasmid DNA" is used herein to indicate DNA that forms part of a plasmid contained in the cells and encompasses any form of plasmid DNA, including vectors such as episomal vectors (i.e. BPV), integrating vectors, and viral vectors such as adenovirus vectors and retroviral vectors, cosmids, YACs, BACs and PACs.<br>
The term "impeller" as used herein, refers to an element, which on rotation in a liquid, causes mixing of the liquid. Preferably, the impeller has one or more blades for mixing the liquid. There are numerous different types of impellers with different types of blade. Suitable impellers for use in the present invention are described in the Ekato handbook of mixing technology - Impeller Systems, Ekato, (Published by Ruhr and Mischtechnik GmbH). Preferably, the impeller is an axial impeller. An axial impeller is defined as an impeller having an axial component in the flow it imparts. Such an axial component ensures that the impeller pumps the fluid in an axial direction drawing in the fluid axially and ejecting it so that the flow of the liquid moves along the sides of the vessel which are substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the impellers. The impeller may be a helical ribbon type impeller as described in the Ekato handbook of mixing technology - Impeller Systems (supra). A helical ribbon impeller comprises a strip spiral or blade attached to the rotatable axle of the vessel with one or more bars. The helical ribbon impeller induces an axial flow by displacement and also creates a tangential flow.<br>
The impellers used in the present invention are low power number impellers. The term "a low power number impeller" refers to an impeller having a low power number (Po), which is a property of the impeller/vessel configuration calculated according to the following formula.<br>
Po=27tNM pN3D5 where<br>
2:i;Nm is equal to the power (W)<br>
Po is power number and is dimensionless<br>
N is impeller speed (rps)<br>
M is torque (Nm)<br>
p is density of the liquid to be mixed (kg m"3)<br>
u is impeller length (m)<br>
A low power number is herein defined as less than 2, more preferably less than 1 and most preferably less than 0.5 when measured in a Newtonian fluid, specifically water.<br>
Preferably the impellers are the INTERMIG® impeller as manufactured by Ekato in Germany. An INTERMIG® impeller is an interference multistage counter flow impeller. The INTERMIG® has an outer double blade at each distal end and the double blade is arranged in a staggered position in a peripheral direction. The axial effect of the INTERMIG® impeller is increased by the staggering of the outer blades. An INTERMIG® impeller is shown in Figure 3. Alternatively, the preferred impeller is a helical ribbon impeller as defined in the Ekato handbook of mixing technology -Impeller Systems (supra). The helical ribbon impeller may be a continuous helical impeller or may be modified so that subsequent to the addition of a liquid, none of the impeller intersects the air/liquid interface. This may be achieved by dividing the helical ribbon impeller into sections and separating the sections on the axle with gaps in between each section of the impeller thereby forming a sectioned helical impeller. Each section of the helical ribbon impeller can be seen as a separate impeller. A suitably modified sectioned helical ribbon impeller is shown in Figure 4. The present invention also provides a sectioned helical ribbon impeller comprising two or more sections of a helical impeller which when present on an axle have a gap in between the sections which does not contain a blade or part of a blade of an impeller.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the impeller length to the internal diameter of the vessel is greater than 0.5, more preferably greater than 0.6.<br>
The position of the one or more impellers in the vessel may also be important for achieving efficient mixing. The impellers are preferably positioned so that subsequent to any addition of a liquid to the vessel, none of the impellers intersect the air/liquid interface, thereby ensuring that turbulence of the air/liquid interface is reduced and the risk of introducing air bubbles into the cell suspension is also reduced.<br>
Depending on the size of the vessel used, the number of impellers varies. For example, vessels having a volume of 1 to 5 1, preferably at least two impellers and more preferably at least 3 impellers are used. For vessels having a volume of 5 to 60 1, at least 3 to 5 impellers are preferably used. For vessels having a volume between 60 and<br>
] 000 1, tf least 4 to 6 impellers are preferably used. However, if a continuous helical ribbon impeller is used, and as the helical ribbon impeller gives mixing throughout the vessel, it is possible to use only one continuous helical ribbon impeller for the vessel. However, the continuous helical impeller may optionally be used in combination with one or more non-helical ribbon axial impellers such as an INTERMIG® or propeller impeller, as defined in the Ekato handbook of mixing technology - Impeller Systems, Ekato (supra). Impellers are used in the vessel of the present invention in order to achieve mixing throughout the contents of the vessel and to avoid compartmentalisation at any point within the vessel. Compartmentalisation is the situation when there is a part of the vessel contents which is not being mixed with the rest of the vessel contents i.e. a compartment is formed in contents of the vessel which does not mix with the rest of the contents of the vessel. The round bottom or dished bottom of many vessels can be an area where compartmentalisation occurs. Preferably, an impeller is positioned adjacent to the bottom of such vessels to ensure that compartmentalisation does not occur. It is further preferred, especially when a continuous helical impeller is not used, that a separate impeller is used in each addition zone. The term "addition zone" refers to the section of the vessel filled when one of the three solutions, the cell suspension, lysis buffer and neutralisation buffer, is added to the vessel. The impeller set up of a vessel can be tested to determine if the impellers entrap air into the liquid and whether compartmentalisation occurs with the set power input limits. The vessel can be tested using standard visualisation techniques such as observation of the motion of tracer particles in transparent fluids, decolourisation and the use of X-ray photographic techniques in opaque fluids (Elson et aL, Chem. Eng; Sci., 4^, 2555-2562, 1986; Cronin et aL, Food Bioprod. Proc. Trans. I. Chem. E.5 Part C, 72, 35-40; Smith et al., Chem. Eng, Sci., 39,1093,1975; and Kuboi et al., Chem. Eng. Comm., 22,29,1983).<br>
The term "well-mixed zone" refers to the area around each impeller in which liquid is caused to mix. The well-mixed zone can be determined by standard flow visualisation techniques, including observation of motion tracer particles in transparent fluids, decolourisation and the use of X-ray photographic techniques in opaque fluids (Elson et al., Chem. Eng. Sci., 41,2555-2562, 1986; Cronin et al., Food Bioprod. Proc. Trans. I. Chem. E., Part C, 72, 35-40; Smith et al., Chem. Eng, Sci., 39, 1093,1975; and Kuboi et al., Chem. Eng. Comm., 22, 29, 1983). The well-mixed zone is preferably the<br>
area around each impeller where the greatest flow occurs.   The. well-mixed zone is preferably adjacent to the distal end of the impeller or impellers.<br>
The term "feedline" as used herein, refers to an element capable of delivering fluids to a well-mixed zone. The vessel may comprises one or more feedlines enabling the addition of fluids to a well-mixed zone. A well-mixed zone is generally found adjacent to the distal end of one or more of the impellers. The feedlines may be a tube or a series of tubes that are present on the inner wall of the vessel and allow the delivery of fluid at substantially the same level in the vessel as an impeller. The fluid is delivered via the tube or tubes to substantially the same level within the vessel as the level of the impeller and is therefore considered to be delivered adjacent to the distal end of one or more of the impellers and into a well-mixed zone. Preferably, the fluid is delivered via the tube or tubes adjacent to the distal ends of two or more impellers. It is further preferred that there is at least one feedline for each impeller and/or at least one feedline for each addition zone. In the smaller vessels, i.e. less than 101, one point of addition at the level of the one or more impellers will be sufficient. However, in larger vessels, i.e. greater than 10 1 it is preferred that fluids be introduced into the vessel at the level of the impeller at numerous points around the inner wall of the vessel. One way of achieving this is by introducing the fluid via annular sparge lines so that fluid enters simultaneously via a large number of ports positioned adjacent to the arc formed by the distal end of the impeller on rotation of the impeller. Another way is by using multiple ports at the level of each impeller. The tube or tubes forming the feedlines may be moveable within the vessel so that the level at which fluids are added can be altered during mixing.<br>
It is further preferred that the feedline is so formed as to direct fluid being added towards the impeller.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the feedline is a conduit within the axle carrying the impellers which passes through one or more impellers to deliver the liquid adjacent to the distal end of the one or more impeller.<br>
Preferably, the feedlines all deliver fluid to the zone of greatest mixing generally formed around the distal end of one or more impellers.<br>
Preferably, the feedlines allow addition of each of the solutions to the vessel in less than 2 minutes.<br>
The term "aspect ratio" as used herein, refers to the ratio of the height of the liquid within the vessel to the width of the liquid in the vessel. Where the vessel does not have a uniform height or width, the maximum width and height may be used to calculate the aspect ratio. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the vessel has an aspect ratio in the range of 0.5 to 2.5. By having a low aspect ratio, the vessel further enhances efficient mixing. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the aspect ratio of the vessel is 1.0.<br>
The term "baffle" as used herein, refers to an element, which diverts the flow of liquid in the vessel. Baffles help to prevent the rotation of liquid inside the vessel, encourage top to bottom secondary flows and prevent the formation of a central vortex and subsequent air entrapment. The development of top to bottom secondary flows are important for mixing throughout the vessel as additional quantities of fluid are added sequentially and each must be homogenised throughout the whole contents of the vessel efficiently. The most common type of baffle is a strip of material having a width of approximately 10% of the internal vessel diameter, which extends along the length of the vessel in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the one or more impellers. The edge of the baffles may be flush against the internal wall of the vessel or may be spaced away from the wall by a gap of approximately 0.1 to 5 cm. However, other types of baffles can also be employed such as those described by Nagata (Mixing Principles and Applications. John Wiley, New York, USA, 1975). The vessel has one or more baffles spaced substantially equally around the inner surface of the vessel, wherein the one or more baffles extend substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the impellers. Preferably at least two baffles and more preferably at least four baffles are used in the vessel. Preferably, the baffles extend along the entire length of the vessel. The baffles are preferably 3 to 15%, more preferably 6 to 12% and most preferably 10% of the internal diameter of the vessel in width. The edge of each baffle may be flush with the inner wall of the vessel or may be spaced away from the inner wall of the vessel. The position of the baffles is preferably so that there is a close clearance between the baffles and the arc formed by the distal end of an impeller on its rotation. Preferably, the close clearance is between 0.1 and 10cm, more preferably between 1 to 5cm. In a particularly preferred embodiment, when the vessel has an internal diameter of about 0.45 metres and a volume of 60 1, it is preferred that there are 4 baffles, each having a width of 10% of the internal vessel diameter.<br>
The use of baffles in mixing vessels is described in Ekato handbook of mixing technology - Impeller Systems, Ekato (supra) and in Nagata (Mixing Principles and Applications, Wiley, New York, 1975).<br>
The term "substantial fragmentation" as used herein, refers to the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA to a level where the level of fragmented DNA in the purified product exceeds 4% of the weight of the desired product. In particular, when the desired product is plasmid DNA the term "substantial fragmentation" as used herein, refers to the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA to a level where the level of fragmented DNA in the purified product exceeds 4% of the total DNA content by weight when the plasmid DNA is purified according to the method of International Patent Application WO 97/29190. When the desired product is a protein the level of chromosomal DNA contamination is measured after the protein has been purified according to the method of Falconer et al., (Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 53, 453-458, 1997). Preferably, when the desired product is a protein, the level of chromosomal DNA contamination is less than 0.5% of the purified protein by weight.<br>
The vessel preferably has a volume between 5 1 and 1,000 1, more preferably between 50 1 and 500 1 and most preferably between 50 1 and 100 I. Suitable lysis vessels are manufactured by Yateson Engineering Ltd. Bolton, United Kingdom.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for using of the vessel of the present invention in the lysis of cells of a cell suspension, which contains chromosomal DNA and a desired product, wherein the one or more impellers are rotated at a speed selected such that efficient mixing is obtained without generating mechanical stresses sufficient to lead to substantial fragmentation of chromosomal DNA or floes of aggregated material. Preferably, the desired product is plasmid DNA.<br>
The method of the present invention preferably comprises adding the cell suspension to the vessel, mixing the cell suspension, adding a lysis solution to the cell suspension, mixing the cell suspension until the cells have lysed, adding a neutralising solution and mixing until neutralisation is achieved and floes of aggregated material are generated. On neutralisation, the plasmid DNA is renatured. The plasmid DNA can then be further purified using standard processes such as bag filtration and chromatography, which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the method of the present invention, it is preferred that the solutions added to the vessel are added using feedlines that are immersed within liquid contained in the<br>
vessel. Preferably, each solution is mixed in the vessel in less than 4 minutes, preferably in less than 2 minutes.<br>
The cell suspension can be any cell suspension in any medium. Preferably the cell suspension has a cell density of 70 to 300g wet weight I"1.<br>
The cell suspension is preferably mixed to generate and maintain a homogeneous solution. Preferably, the cell suspension is mixed whilst the lysis solution is added. The lysis solution is preferably a mixture of sodium hydroxide and SDS. Preferably, the lysis solution is added according to the method described in International Patent Application WO 97/29290. The combination of the high pH and the detergent results in lysis of cells and denaturation of chromosomal DNA as well as other cellular components. Preferably, the lysis solution is mixed with the cell suspension to generate a lysate in as short a period as possible to minimise the exposure to high pH levels present in the lysis buffer and thereby reduce the formation of irreversibly denatured plasmid DNA but not sufficiently high to cause mechanical damage to the chromosomal DNA.<br>
Once lysis is complete, the viscoelastic properties of the resultant lysate will have dramatically increased and this can be used as a measure of the completion of lysis. The increase in viscoelastic properties may be visualised directly by observing the Weissenburg effect of the fluid climbing up the shaft of the impeller. This may also be measured indirectly, but more objectively, by monitoring the torque on the stirrer motor of the lysis vessel. By torque is meant the turning moment exerted by the motor of the impeller axle.<br>
Whilst mixing the unlysed cell suspension, which behaves as a low viscosity Newtonian fluid, a stable low level of torque is observed. Upon lysis, the torque rises rapidly until lysis is complete, when it stabilises at a maximum value.<br>
Accordingly, this aspect of the invention provides a method for monitoring the degree of lysis of a cell suspension in a vessel whose contents are mixed by rotating one or more impellers, comprising measuring the torque applied to the axle of the impeller, wherein the torque increases in proportion to the degree of cell lysis until lysis is complete, when it stabilises at a maximum value. Once lysis is complete, the viscoelastic properties of the resultant lysate will have dramatically increased and this can be used as a measure of the completion of lysis. On lysis, the torque generally increases between five and fifteen-fold (i.e. 500-1500%) before stabilising at a constant<br>
value. Preferably, a rise of greater than 300% of the initial torque is indicative of lysis, more preferably greater than 500%, even more preferably greater than 1000% increase.<br>
When lysis is complete, or after a short, pre-determined period of incubation, preferably 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably 2 to 20 minutes and most preferably 5 to 10 minutes, the addition of a neutralisation buffer through the appropriate delivery feedline is initiated. The neutralisation buffer can be any strong organic acidic buffer such as glacial acetic acid. Preferably, the neutralisation buffer is 3M KAc, lOmM EDTA pH 5.5. Preferably, the neutralisation buffer is added while the lysate is being mixed. Efficient mixing and neutralisation can be visualised directly, this time by disappearance of the Weissenburg effect due to a loss in viscoelastic properties of the lysate.<br>
Again, this effect may be measured by monitoring the change in torque on the stirrer, which is seen to fall rapidly on neutralisation as the Theological properties of the lysate return to those of a low-viscosity Newtonian fluid. In the method of this aspect of the invention, complete neutralisation of the cell lysate is generally indicated by a decrease in torque, preferably to less than 50% of the maximum torque on the axle during the lysis stage of the reaction. More preferably, a drop to less than 30% of the maximum value achieved, most preferably to less than 25% of the maximum value, is indicative of neutralisation.<br>
Complete neutralisation is important, since failure to return the fluid to one with a viscosity of less than 3mPas and negligible viscoelastic properties results in poor filtration characteristics in subsequent purification steps and a decrease in overall yield.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention provides a method for preparing a desired product from a cell suspension in a vessel, comprising the steps of lysing said cells by alkaline lysis to give a cell lysate, neutralising said cell lysate and preparing the desired product from the cell lysate, wherein the contents of said vessel are mixed by rotating one or more impellers, and wherein progress of the lysis and neutralisation reactions is monitored by measuring the torque applied to the axle of the impeller.<br>
As the skilled reader will appreciate, torque may be measured using any measure of energy input as related either directly or indirectly to mechanical resistance in the contents of the vessel. For example, the increase in viscoelastic properties may be visualised directly by observing the Weissenburg effect of the fluid climbing up the<br>
shaft of the impeller. This may also be measured indirectly, but more objectively, by monitoring the torque on the stirrer motor of the lysis vessel. In the case of an electric motor-driven impeller, torque may conveniently be monitored by measuring the increased current drawn to maintain a constant speed of impeller rotation. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, a rheometer is used to measure torque and thus monitor the progress of the reaction.<br>
The plasmid contained in the cells may be any plasmid or vector as indicated above but is preferably a nucleic acid vector comprising DNA. The plasmid may be of linear or circular configuration and may be adapted for episomal or integrated existence in the host cell as set forth in the extensive body of literature known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention also relates to a plasmid obtained from a cell culture lysed using the vessel of the present invention.<br>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Construction of therapeutic expression plasmid vector pTXOl 61<br>
pTX0161 is a high copy number (ColEl origin of replication) plasmid vector carrying the Escherichia coli B nitroreductase gene (ntr) driven by the cytomegalovirus<br>
immediate early promoter. Delivery of this vector to mammalian tumour cells allows specific cell killing by the prodrug CB 1954 (Drabek et al, Gene Therapy, 4, 93-100, 1997), a form of enhanced cancer chemotherapy described as gene directed en2yme-prodrug therapy or GDEPT.<br>
pTX0161 was constructed by the removal of the ntr cassette from pTX0160 (Williams et al., Nuc, Acids Res., 26, 2120-2124, 1998) as an Apal-bluatsd, Xbdl restriction enzyme digested fragment which was then inserted into pTXOOOS (a pUC19 derived vector encoding tetracycline resistance).<br>
Generation of the Production Strain: PHI pTX0161<br>
1 Ong of pTX0161 plasmid DNA was used to transform calcium competent E. coli DH1 cells (Hanahan, Mol. Biol., 166, 557-580, 1983). A single transformant was selected to generate a Master Cell Bank (MCB) of the Production Strain under conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice. Cells harvested from an exponentially growing culture, were cryopreserved in 20% glycerol and stored at -80°C to constitute the MCB.<br>
Fermentation of PHI pTX0161 Inoculum preparation<br>
A 1ml vial of DH1 pTXOl 61 was taken from the MCB and thawed rapidly at<br>
37°C. The contents of this vial was aseptically inoculated into 5ml of LB medium (Peptone 10g/l, Yeast Extract 5g/l, NaCl 5g/l) supplemented with tetracycline (12<br>
u-gml"1) in a 30ml universal bottle. This was incubated at 37°C in an orbital shaker (200rpm). During mid-exponential growth phase, 4ml of this culture was used to inoculate 46 ml of Terrific broth (Tartof and Hobbs, Focus, 9,2-12,1987) supplemented with tetracycline (12 µgml"1) in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask. This was grown, as above, before being subcultured in two stages (200ml and 2000ml cultures in Terrific broth with tetracycline) and used to inoculate the fermenter once grown to a cell density of 2 OD600nm-Fermentation<br>
A rich complex batch medium consisting of final concentrations of KH2PO4<br>
(3g/l), Na2HP04 (6g/l), NaCl (0.5g/l), Peptone (2g/l), (NH4)9S04 (10g/l),<br>
polypropylene glycol, molecular weight 2025g (0.2%), Trace element solution (0.05% [consisting of CoCl2.6H20 (2g/l), CuCl2.2H20 (1.9g/l), H3BO3 (1.6g/l), MnS04.H2O<br>
(1.6g/l), Na2Mo04.2H20 (2g/l), ZnCl2-7H2O (2g/l), Fe2(SO4)3.xH20 (lg/1), CaCl2.2H20 (lg/1), and Citric acid (60g/l)]), CaCl2.2H2O (0.03g/l), FeS04.7H20 (0.04g/l), citric acid (0.02g/l) and yeast extract (20g/l) was prepared and made up to a volume of 46 1 in the fermentation vessel. After sterilisation in situ, aseptic additions of glycerol (2.8%), MgS04 (0.5g/l) and vitamin solution (5ml/l [consisting of biotin 0.6g/l, folic acid 0.04g/l, pyridoxine-HCl lAg/l, riboflavin 0.42g/l, pantothenoic acid 5.4g/l, niacin 6.lg/1]) and tetracycline (12mg/l) were made.<br>
The vessel was then inoculated as above. Fermentation was carried out at 37°C, pH 6.8 with the dissolved oxygen setpoint 50% of air saturation.<br>
The vessel was sampled regularly and the ODgOOnm recorded to allow calculation of the specific growth rate. Plasmid DNA was isolated from samples during culture for qualitative analysis and from fermentation end-points for quantitative comparision (Qiagen Maxi plasmid purification kits, Qiagen Ltd.). Dry weight determination was used to estimate biomass.<br>
Plasmid Copy Number Estimation<br>
The molecular weight of pTX0l 61, a 7796 base plasmid, is 5.06 x 106 Daltons. The specific recovered plasmid yield can be converted to a recovered plasmid copy<br>
number, knowing that 1 OD600nm unit is equivalent to 2 x 10 cells ml"1 for this fermentation culture (Kech and Brent, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et aL, Eds, John Wiley Sons Inc., New York, 1.2.2,1995).<br>
Fermentation Cell Harvesting<br>
Cells were harvested when in late exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 5000g for 25 minutes at 4°C in sterile 1000ml centrifuge bottles. The clarified supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were either frozen at -80°C or removed from the pots and transfer into bags prior to freezing.<br>
Manual Lysis Procedure<br>
The manual lysis procedure used as a comparison with the lysis vessel procedure is the Qiagen Midi and Maxi protocol (Qiagen Plasmid Purification Handbook 1997).<br>
Primary Plasmid DNA Recovery by Modified Alkaline Cell Lysis<br>
Preparation of a Cell Suspension for 5 / cell Lysis<br>
A total of 180g (wet weight) of cells were removed from storage at -80°C and thawed at 18°C for approximately 20 minutes. Cell suspension buffer (50mM Tris lOmM EDTA at pH 8.0) was added to each centrifuge bottle sufficient to solubilise the cell pellet. Resuspended cells were pooled and mixed with a Silverson high shear mixer to generate a homogeneous suspension. The volume was then adjusted (by weight) with cell suspension buffer to 1 litre, a final cell concentration of approximately 180g cell wet weight I"1 cell suspension buffer.<br>
Preparation of a Cell Suspension for 60 I cell Lysis<br>
A total of 1800g (wet weight) of cells were removed from storage at -80°C and thawed at 18°C for approximately 20 minutes. The cell paste was removed from the bags and added to 91 of cell suspension buffer (50mM Tris lOmM EDTA at pH 8.0). The cells were then suspended into the buffer using a Silverson High shear mixer to generate a homogeneous suspension. The volume of the cell suspension was then adjusted (by weight) with cell suspension buffer to 15 litres, a final cell concentration of approximately 120g cell wet weight I"1 cell suspension buffer.<br>
Bag Filtration<br>
The contents of the holding vessels was pumped through a 100 urn woven nylon bag filter (Plastok Holdings Ltd) prior to 5 urn filtration via a Poly guard depth filter (Millipore UK Ltd. Watford, England).<br>
Expanded Bed Adsorption Chromatography<br>
A Streamline 50 chromatography column (Pharmacia) was packed with 480 ml of DEAE Streamline (Pharmacia). The chromatography bed was expanded using 0.1M NaOH by upward linear flow at a rate of 105cmhr"1, stopped to allow overnight<br>
sanitisation and re-expanded in equilibration buffer (0.8 M KAc, 10 mM EDTA pH 5.5) to prepare the column for loading. The plasmid containing filtrate was pumped onto the column at the same linear flow rate. Once loaded, the column was washed with equilibration buffer until the on-line absorbance detector (optical density at 254nm or OD254nm) was reduced to 20% of the maximum value or less. The column was then washed with a low salt buffer (25mM Potassium acetate, 1 OmM EDTA pH5.5) and the fluid flow direction was reversed. This allows packing of the chromatography gel in the column and reduces the buffer volumes required for subsequent steps. Washing was continued until 5% of the maximum OD254nm value was reached before residual KNA fragments were eluted from the column using 0.5M salt wash buffer (25mM Potassium acetate, lOmM EDTA, 0.5M NaCl pH 5.5). Plasmid DNA was then eluted with elution buffer (0.75 M NaCl, 25 mM KAc 10 mM EDTA pH 5.5) and stored overnight at +4 to +8°C.<br>
Concentration of the Streamline Eluate<br>
An Pellicon XL ultrafiltration device (Millipore UK Ltd, Watford, England) was sanitised with 0.1M NaOH and flushed with elution buffer. The plasmid enriched Streamline column eluate was concentrated approximately 25 fold by ultrafiltration using a 30 Kilodalton molecular weight cut off membrane. The concentrate was decanted and the system flushed with buffer to remove residual plasmid DNA which was pooled with the concentrate. The pool volume of ~50ml was stored at 4-10°C overnight.<br>
Size Exclusion Chromatography<br>
To remove residual contaminants such as digested RNA fragments, and in order to exchange the plasmid into a suitable formulation buffer, the concentrated Streamline eluate was loaded onto an Pharmacia XK16 column packed with approximately 112 ml of Pharmacia S500HR media (bed height 56cm). The column pipework had been previously sanitised with 0.1M NaOH, and equilibrated with 0.3M NaCl. The entire concentrate was loaded onto the column at 1.2 ml/minute. The OD254nm of the column eluate was monitored throughout the run and 2ml fractions collected. Material in the first OD 260 nm peak were regarded as being pure plasmid DNA and were pooled. The volume of the pool was approximately 20-25 ml. Samples for quality control analysis<br>
were removed and the remainder of the bulk plasmid pool aliquoted and frozen at -80°C.<br>
DNA Analysis for Quality Control<br>
Product concentration<br>
The total nucleic acid concentration (strength of solution) was determined spectrophotometrically by recording the optical density at 260 nm and converting this value to mg/ml assuming that the extinction coefficient of a 0.0005% solution of plasmid DNA in a 1 cm path length cell is 0.02 units. Highly concentrated samples were diluted by weight such that the recorded optical density was within the linear response range of the chromophore.<br>
Host chromosomal DNA<br>
Host chromosomal DNA contamination was assessed using PCR analysis, employing oligonucleotide primers complementary to a ubiquitous element of the E. coli genome. Standards of pTX0161 purified by double density gradient ultracentrifugation (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, Nolan el aL, (Eds), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989) were spiked in duplicate with varying percentages (w/w) of DH1 host chromosomal DNA. An identical quantity of the pTX0161 was also subjected to the reaction and analysed alongside the other samples by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis. Maximum contamination levels were derived based on a comparison of the intensity of the host chromosomal DNA spiked standards against the sample being tested.<br>
Endotoxin contamination<br>
Endotoxin contamination was assessed using the KQCL kinetic chromogenic assay (Biowhittaker UK Ltd). Product was diluted to a range known to overcome interference. Positive product controls were included to confirm that no inhibition or enhancement of the reaction cascade by sample or buffer components had occurred.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The, vessel (1) has a volume of 5 1, an internal diameter of 165mm and is operated with two feedlines (2, 3) in the vessel (1). The vessel (1) has three InterMig impellers (4, 5, 6) positioned 18mm, 105mm and 155mm from the bottom of the vessel (1). The impellers are 116mm in length. The first feedline (2) is positioned so that fluid is delivered at the same level as the lowest impeller (4). The first feedline (2) is used to add a cell suspension and subsequently a lysis buffer to the vessel (1). The second feedline (3) is positioned so that fluid is delivered at the same level as the second impeller (5). The second feedline (3) is used to add a neutralisation buffer.<br>
The vessel (1) also has four baffles (7) spaced equally around the inner vertical wall of the vessel (1) which are substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the impellers (4, 5, 6). Each baffle (7) has a width of 15mm and is approximately 315mm in length. The baffles (7) are spaced from the internal wall of the vessel (1) by a 5mm gap. The clearance between the baffles and the arc formed by rotation of the impellers is 5mm.<br>
The feedlines (2, 3) are constructed from 5 or 10 ml pipettes with the bottom tapered section removed and the plugs removed from the top section connected to lengths of peristaltic pump tubing. The feedlines (2, 3) have an internal diameter of approximately 4mm.<br>
The vessel (1) has an aspect ratio of 1.1 (183/165).<br>
Lysis protocol<br>
A 180 g/1 (wet weight) solution of E. coli DH1 cells containing plasmid pTX0161 was generated by resuspending 180g of frozen cells into cell suspension buffer (50mM Tris base, lOmM EDTA pH8.0) using a Silverson high shear lab mixer (Silverson Machines Ltd.) as indicated above. The solution was mixed until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The volume was then adjusted to 1 1 with cell suspension buffer. The solution was then transferred to the lysis vessel (1) and mixed at 75 rpm. 100 mg of RNaseA was then added to the solution and incubated for 5 minutes with stirring.<br>
2 1 of lysis buffer (0.155M NaOH/1% SDS), at a flow rate of 1 1/min were added and the timing of the lysis started at this point. When all the lysis buffer had been added (2 minutes), the stirrer speed was increased to 125 rpm and maintained until all the cells<br>
had been solubilised (4 minutes after lysis started).   The impellers were then switched off.<br>
At 9 minutes 30 seconds after lysis started the contents of the vessel were stirred at a speed of 75 rpm. At 10 minutes after lysis was started, 1 1 of the neutralisation buffer (3M KAc, l0mM EDTA pH5.5) was added at a flow rate of 500 ml/min. When the top impeller (6) was completely covered, the impeller speed was raised to 100 rpm and maintained until the Weissenburg effect was lost (12 minutes). Lysis was then regarded as complete and the impellers switched off.<br>
The vessel contents were cooled for 40 minutes by circulating chilled water at 5°C around the vessel to reduce the temperature of the contents to about 10°C. The vessel contents were then filtered via a l00µm bag filter (Plastok Holdings Ltd., Birkenhead, England) and 5um depth filter (Millipore Ltd., Watford, England) as described above. The collected filtrate was then purified via expanded bed chromatography as described above.<br>
It should be noted that the generation of homogenous cell suspension prior to lysis can be achieved using the vessel of the present invention.<br>
Yield and contamination measurements were made as described above.<br>

Description of the lysis vessel<br>
The vessel (8) has a volume of 60 1, an internal diameter of 455mm and is operated with three feedlines (9, 10, 11). The vessel has a lid (17) which forms a hermetic seal with the main body of the vessel. The vessel has five impellers (12, 13, 14, 15, 16). The first impeller (12) is a propeller type impeller having the same pitch angle as an InterMIG impeller (see Figure 3) with the distal forked heads (16) removed. The first impeller (12) is 190mm in length. The remaining four impellers are InterMIG impellers as shown in Figure 3 and are 280mm in length. The impellers are positioned 45mm, 100mm, 185mm, 270mm and 370mm from the. bottom of the vessel, respectively. The first two impellers (12, 13) are therefore within the bottom 15 1 level<br>
of the vessel (8) and are used to stir the cell suspension. The third and fourth impellers (14, 15) are placed in the 15 1 to 45 1 levels of the vessel (8) and with the first two impellers (12, 13) will be used to mix cells with the lysis solution. The fifth impeller (16) is placed in the 45 to 60 1 level of the vessel (8) and with the first four impellers (12, 13, 14, 15) will be used to mix the neutralised solution.<br>
The first feedline (9) is movable between the level of the first and second impellers (12, 13). In this example, the feedline is positioned to deliver fluid at the same level as the first impeller (12). The second feedline (10) is movable between the level of the first and second impeller (12j 13). In this example, the feedline is initially positioned to deliver fluid at the same level as the second impeller (13). The third feedline (11) is movable between the level of the second, third, fourth and fifth impellers (13, 14, 15, 16). In this example, the feedline is initially positioned at the level of the third impeller (14). The feedlines (9, 10) are fed by peristaltic pumps (Watson Marlow 600 series fitted 1.75cm ID silicone tubing (Watson Marlow Ltd., Falmouth, England) under manual control.<br>
The vessel (8) also has four baffles (18) spaced equally around the inner vertical wall of the vessel (8) which are substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the impellers (12, 13, 14, 15, 16). Each baffle (18) has a width of 45mm and is approximately 330mm in length. The baffles (18) are spaced from the internal wall of the vessel (8) by a 1 Omm gap.<br>
The vessel (8) has an aspect ratio of 0.97 (440/455).<br>
Lysis Protocol<br>
A 15 1 solution of cell suspension of E.co//'_DHl cells containing plasmid pTX0161 at a concentration of 120g/l was generated by resuspending 1200g of frozen<br>
cells into cell suspension buffer (50mM Tris base, lOmM EDTA pH.8) at 4°C. Resuspension was achieved using a Silverson high shear mixer (Silverson Machines Ltd) as described above. The solution was mixed until a homogeneous solution was achieved, the volume was then adjusted by weight to 15 1 using cell suspension buffer. The cells were generated by the fermentation protocol outlined above and harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C prior to use.<br>
The cell suspension was transferred to the lysis vessel (8) and agitated at a speed of 8rpm. 1,5g of RNase (Sigma Chemicals) resuspended in 15ml of cell suspension buffer was added to the cell suspension and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.<br>
The impeller speed was increased to 44rpm and 30 1 of cell lysis buffer (0.155M NaOH, 1.0% SDS) was added to the solution. Initially this was added through the first and the second feedlines (9, 10) at a flow rate of 7.4 1/min. When third impeller (14) was completely covered with liquid, lysis buffer was also added via the third feedline (11) at a flow rate of 7.4 1/min. Addition of the lysis solution was completed in less than 2 minutes. The solution was then stirred for a further 2 minutes after which the impellers were stopped and the lysate allowed to incubate.<br>
The height of the third feedline (11) previously at the level of the third impeller (14) was raised to the level of the fourth impeller (15).<br>
Ten minutes after the start of the addition of the lysis buffer the impellers were switched on at a speed of 74rpm and 15 I of neutralisation buffer (3M Potassium Acetate, lOmM EDTA pH5.5 at 4°C) was added via all the feedlines (9, 10, 11) simultaneously at a flow rate of 3.75 1/min. This addition was completed in less than 2 minutes after which the impeller speed was reduced to 26rpm and these conditions were maintained for an additional 3 minutes after which impeller speed was reduced to 16rpm for a further 6 minutes.<br>
The vessel contents were then filtered via a 1 OOum bag filter (Plastok Holdings Ltd., Birkenhead, England) and Sum depth filter (Millipore Ltd., Watford, England) as described above. The collected filtrate was then purified via expanded bed chromatography as described above.<br>
Yield and contamination measurements were made as described above.<br>
Results<br>
Plasmid Yield	344u.g/g wet weight<br>
Endotoxin content	13 Eu/mg<br>
Chromosomal DNA	4%<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The lysis vessel was as described in Example 1 with the following modifications. Mixing was either by three INTERMIG impellers, positioned at 50mm intervals from the base of the vessel, or by two split helical ribbons, with the bottom impeller 3.8cm from the base of the vessel and the two impellers 5.8cm apart<br>
Lysis protocol<br>
A 120g/L of cell suspension of DH1 host strain was prepared using a high shear mixer and then transferred to the lysis vessel and mixed at 125 rpm. 2L lysis buffer was added at a flow rate of IL/min to this solution and a mixing speed of 125 rpm was maintained throughout the lysis, incubation and neutralisation steps. On completion of the incubation, 1L of neutralisation buffer was added at a flow rate of IL/min.<br>
Determination of motor torque<br>
Motor torque was determined using a Visco-Mix rheometer supplied by Coesfield, Mess Technich GMBH. Germany. This was connected to the stirrer shaft to which various types of impellers were attached and the lysis performed as described.<br>
Results<br>
The results shown in Figure 5 show a rapid increase in motor torque during the addition of the lysis buffer. This is indicative of changes in the rheological properties of the lysis solution. The graph shows that for both types of impeller that a stable state is achieved less than 3 mins after the completion of the addition of the lysis buffer, indicating that no further changes in rheological properties are occurring and from which complete lysis is inferred.<br>
Upon the addition of the neutralisation buffer, a dramatic decrease in motor torque is seen; followed by a stable state, again indicating that no further changes in rheological properties are occurring and that complete neutralisation has occurred.<br>
