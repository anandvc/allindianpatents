				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br><br>
This invention concerns a method and a device for detection of broken<br>
filaments, more particularly in a process of a<br>
preparing polymeric filaments, and especially a process<br>
of melt-spinning synthetic polymers, and in a device<br>
that is capable of detecting defects as small as a<br>
broken filament in such a process, or in other<br>
processes, and improvements in products resulting<br>
therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Spinning of synthetic filaments from melts of<br>
synthetic polymers (melt-spinning), and from solvent<br>
solutions of synthetic polymers and of regenerated<br>
polymers (solvent-spinning), has been carried out<br>
commercially for much of the present century, and on a<br>
very large scale, amounting to millions of tons, and at<br>
high speeds, ranging from hundreds to thousands of<br>
meters/min. Most of such filaments are of fine dpf<br>
(denier per filament, 1 denier being the weight in<br>
grams of 9 km of the filament, and 1 dtex being the<br>
weight in grams of 10 km of the filament). There have<br>
been several suggestions in the art to detect "spinning<br>
drips", such as Harvey et al. U.S. Defensive<br>
Publication T886,007, published May, 1971, disclosing a<br>
slotted device for detecting oversize defects in yarns<br>
or filaments, and being particularly adapted to solvent<br>
spinning of synthetic fibers for detecting oversize<br>
filaments or polymer drips. Harvey's slotted device<br>
used a strain gauge, e.g., a type SPB2-15-200 strain<br>
gauge made by Baldwin Lima Hamilton, to measure strain<br>
fluctuations in a slotted guide (as oversized filaments<br>
or polymer drips would touch and deflect the guide).<br>
Harvey disclosed that the device would be used to<br>
indicate such an oversized defect, and could operate a<br><br>
cut-down device, so the filaments could be fed to<br>
waste, or a marking device to locate the defects.<br>
Actual practice on spinning positions has been to use a<br>
cut-out device, of various types.<br>
It would be desirable to improve the ability to<br>
sense and mark defects in freshly-spun filaments<br>
without breaking out the whole end. As will be<br>
appreciated, freshly-spun undrawn synthetic filaments<br>
are very fragile and sensitive, so the problems<br>
involved in the control and monitoring of freshly-spun<br>
undrawn synthetic filaments are of an altogether<br>
different nature than for textile fibers, such as<br>
cotton, wool or drawn synthetic fibers.<br>
In the 1970's, Weidmann et al, in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,133,207 had proposed a device for detecting knot-<br>
like thick places in traveling textile threads,<br>
involving passing the textile thread through a gap<br>
between a thread guide and a mechanical vibratory<br>
system having a fundamental frequency below 10 0 Hz and<br>
comprising a vibratable plate-shaped or cantilever<br>
member and, secured thereto on one face, a<br>
mechanoelectrical transducer element which was a plate-<br>
shaped piezoelectrical structure responsive to<br>
vibration of the vibratable member. Weidmann's device<br>
could be used for assessing knots in weft threads on<br>
weaving machines, and on spinning and winding machines<br>
for assessing or counting knots or knot-like thick<br>
places. So far as is known, Weidmann's device was<br>
never used on a melt-spinning or solvent-spinning<br>
machine.<br>
Piezoelectric elements have been suggested by<br>
several sources over the years for detecting<br>
disturbances in a running threadline, e.g., by Raaben<br>
et al (1971) in U.S. Patent No. 3,611,342, Paul (1978)<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,110,654, Arita et al 1981) in<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,254,613, Kitamura (1983) in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,393,647, Bobbola (1986) in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,605,875, Kimura (1991) in U.S. Patent No. 5,043,708,<br>
and Atex (Savio et al, 1994) in EPA 616 058 Al. These<br>
typically were to detect breakage of yarns as a whole,<br>
not for detecting breakage of a single filament in a<br>
multifilament continuous filament yarn. Also,<br>
typically these prior suggestions were for use on<br>
textile machines, such as during ring-spinning,<br>
twisting, back winding or weaving, not on a melt-<br>
spinning position during initial extrusion from the<br>
melt, quenching or initial winding of freshly-quenched<br>
and spun filaments for yarns or tows.<br>
As mentioned by Weidmann, supra, capacitative<br>
or optoelectrical transducers or sensing devices had<br>
been suggested for operation without touching a thread,<br>
but were expensive to manufacture. For example, The<br>
Technology Partnership Limited discussed several such<br>
thread detector devices in WO 92/01622 (1992) and<br>
suggested an ultrasonic acoustic wave system for such a<br>
purpose.<br>
What has been lacking for all these years has<br>
been a practical device capable of detecting the<br>
presence of a single broken filament during, for<br>
example, melt-spinning while the rest of the threadline<br>
continues to run with unbroken filaments. Even<br>
relatively recently, Reese described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,034,174 the current practice of examining the ends of<br>
a completely wound bobbin of yarn for broken filaments,<br>
counting the number of broken filaments protruding from<br>
the ends of the bobbin to give a measure of the<br>
probable number of broken filaments in the yarn on the<br>
bobbin, and dividing the total number of protruding<br>
broken filaments counted by the number of pounds of<br>
yarn on the bobbin and expressing the result as BFC<br>
(Broken Filament Count). As will be recognized, this<br><br><br>
technique (recently used in practice) has been much<br>
inferior to detecting a filament broken during melt-<br>
spinning on that spinning position, but a practical<br>
method sensitive enough to detect a single broken<br>
filament on a melt-spinning threadline has not hitherto<br>
been available without a significant cost penalty, such<br>
as was mentioned by Weidmann as long ago as during the<br>
1970s.<br>
The present invention solves this long-standing<br>
problem. An essential element of my invention is the<br>
use of a piezoelectric film sensor in detecting a<br>
broken freshly-extruded synthetic filament on, e.g., a<br>
melt-spinning position. Piezoelectric film has been<br>
available commercially for some 10 years, but has not<br>
previously been suggested for use in solving this<br>
problem, despite various publications, e.g., by Ben<br>
Carlisle, in Machine Design, October 23, 1986, pages<br>
105-110, and Carenzo et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,136,202,<br>
which refers to a technical manual and other literature<br>
on Kynar® Piezo Film, published in 1987 and 1988.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the invention,<br>
therefore, there is provided an improvement in a<br>
process for melt-spinning a synthetic polymer into a<br>
multiplicity of filaments, comprising extruding the<br>
molten polymer through spinning capillaries into<br>
filamentary streams, quenching said filamentary streams<br>
with cooling air to harden the streams into filaments,<br>
and applying finish to said filaments, and wherein the<br>
improvement comprises the capability to ser.se and<br>
record the presence of a broken filament by passing<br>
said filaments past a flexible cantilever beam that is<br>
spaced from said filaments at a predetermined distance<br>
from said filaments, and wherein a piezoelectric film<br>
sensor is secured to said beam, and wherein said film<br>
sensor is part of an electric circuit containing also<br><br><br>
means for recording electric impulses from said film<br>
sensor, whereby impact from a filament defect on said<br>
beam will cause said beam to flex and stretch said film<br>
sensor, and will initiate an electric impulse from the<br>
film sensor in said electric circuit, and wherein said<br>
electric impulse is recorded.<br>
The flexible cantilever beam that carries the<br>
piezoelectric film sensor is preferably formed with a<br>
free end that is spaced from a guide, so as to define a<br>
gap of predetermined width between the free end of the<br>
beam and the guide.<br>
According to another aspect, there is provided<br>
a device that it suitable for detecting a broken<br>
filament in a multiplicity of filaments being moved<br>
continuously along a filament path comprising:<br>
(1)	a cantilever beam that has two faces and is<br>
flexible and of low inertia in a direction along said<br>
path, and that is spaced a predetermined distance from<br>
said path,<br>
(2)	a piezoelectric film sensor that is<br>
permanently bonded to a face of said beam whereby, upon<br>
deflection of said beam by a broken filament or other<br>
filamentary defect, said piezoelectric film develops an<br>
electric signal, and<br>
. (3) an electric circuit containing means for<br>
recording said electric signal.<br>
This beam is preferably formed with a free end<br>
that is disposed on a first side of said path, and a<br>
guide member is disposed in opposite relationship to<br>
said free end such that a filament path gap of a<br>
predetermined width is formed between said free end and<br>
said guide member.<br>
Other arrangements may be used, for instance<br>
the beam may be provided with a slot, so that the<br><br>
filament path passes through the slot which forms a filament path<br>
gap of predetermined width.<br>
According to further aspect, improved products such as<br>
improved yarns are provided as a result of applying the process<br>
improvements and of using the device of the invention and the<br>
lessons learned thereby.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved<br>
process for detecting a broken filament in a multiplicity of<br>
filaments, comprising the steps of :<br>
a)	extruding the molten polymer through spinning capillaries<br>
into filamentary streams;<br>
b)	quenching the filamentary streams with cooling air to harden<br>
the streams into filaments; and<br>
c)	applying finish to the filaments; and<br>
wherein the process further includes steps of :<br>
d)	sensing and recording the presence of a broken filament by<br>
passing the filaments past a flexible cantilever beam that is<br>
spaced from the filaments at a predetermined distance from<br>
the filaments, and wherein a piezoelectric film sensor is<br>
secured to the beam, and wherein the film sensor is part of<br>
an  electric  circuit  containing  also  means  for  recording<br>
electric impulses from the film sensor,<br>
e)	whereby impact from a filament defect on the beam will<br>
cause the beam to flex and stretch the film sensor, and will<br>
initiate an electric impulse from the film  sensor in  the<br>
electric circuit, and wherein the electric impulse is recorded<br>
to detect the broken filament.<br>
The present invention also relates to a device for detecting a<br>
broken  filament  in  a  multiplicity  of  filaments  being  moved<br>
continuously along a filament path comprising:<br>
a)    a cantilever beam that has two faces and is flexible and of<br>
low inertia in a direction along the path, and that is spaced a<br>
predetermined distance from the path;<br><br><br>
b)	a piezoelectric film sensor that is permanently bonded to a<br>
face of the beam whereby, upon deflection of the beam by a<br>
broken filament or other filamentary defect, the piezoelectric<br>
film develops an electric signal; and<br>
c)	an electric circuit connected to the piezeolectric film and<br>
provided to communicate the electric signal to means for<br>
recording the electric signal.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a<br>
typical process for melt-spinning synthetic filaments<br>
according to the art.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are schematic views of a<br>
preferred device according to the invention in<br>
elevation and plan-view, respectively.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the invention will<br>
be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings. Referring to Figure 1, showing a typical<br>
high speed melt-spinning apparatus for use in preparing<br>
yarn, molten polyester is melt-spun through orifices in<br>
a heated spinneret block 2. and cooled in the atmosphere<br>
to solidify as filaments l. As the molten polyester<br>
emerges from block 2., it may be protected from the<br>
atmosphere by a metal tube surrounding the filaments as<br>
they pass between the orifices and a zone .10. in which<br>
cooling air is introduced, e.g., symmetrically around<br>
the filaments through the holes in a foraminous metal<br>
tube 11. The filaments may optionally pass between<br>
convergence guides 21, which are arranged so as to<br>
confine the filaments, and then in contact with rolls<br>
20 which rotate in a bath of spin-finish and thus apply<br>
the desired amount of finish to the solid filaments, or<br>
an alternative means of applying spin-finish, such as a<br>
metering device, and then pass another set of guides 22<br><br><br>
which hold the filaments in contact with the finish<br>
roll 20 and direct the filaments to the next set of<br>
guides 25, and on to the windup system, which comprises<br>
a first driven roll 31L, a second driven roll 32., a<br>
traversing guide 35 and a driven take up roll 33, the<br>
yarn being interlaced by an interlacing jet 34. Such a<br>
melt-spinning position has been described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,156,071 (Knox). Several variations may be<br>
used. For instance, interlacing jet 34 may be between<br>
rolls 31 and 32, or between guides 25 and roll 31,<br>
especially for a single-roll wind-up (or godet-less<br>
system), and, for staple, neither interlace nor wind-up<br>
are generally used but the filaments pass in a bundle<br>
from first driven roll 31 to a collecting device,<br>
usually for processing as tow, generally after<br>
combination with other bundles to make a larger tow<br>
bundle. As mentioned, hitherto, it has not generally<br>
been practical to use prior suggestions for monitoring<br>
defects when melt-spinning at high speed. So cleaner<br>
guides have been used, as described in art such as<br>
Quick, U.S. Patent No. 2,624,933 or Ebnesajjad et al,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,668,453, to break out the whole<br>
bundle of filaments as relatively large defects pass<br>
such cleaner guides. Such cleaner guides may be<br>
located conveniently along the melt-spinning<br>
threadline, e.g., where guides are shown at 22 or 25 or<br>
wherever convenient. According to my invention,<br>
however, a device for detecting a broken filament may<br>
be located instead of or in addition to such a cleaner<br>
guide at a similar location along a threadline for<br>
melt-spinning, or otherwise.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a broken filament<br>
detector, indicated generally as 40, is shown on the<br>
right side of Figure 2, with cantilever beam 41<br>
extending toward the threadline 1 as the latter passes<br>
between guides 42 and 44, both located on the same side<br>
of threadline 1 and located above and below beam 41<br><br>
which is also located on the same side of threadline l,.<br>
Guide 43 is located on the far side of threadline l,<br>
i.e., opposite to beam 41, so as to define a gap of<br>
predetermined width between guide 43. and beam 41<br>
through which threadline 1 will pass as it is urged<br>
towards guide 43 by upper guide 42 and lower guide 44.<br>
This gap 48 is shown more particularly in Figure 3,<br>
which does not show threadline 1, and is a plan view<br>
looking upward at detector 40. and guide 43, Figure 3<br>
is on a smaller scale than Figure 2 and shows eight<br>
beams 41 extending from base 45 and guide 43, both<br>
being securely mounted on a rigid support 46. The<br>
eight beams 41 are flexible and may be made of<br>
stainless steel, e.g., 3-4 mils (0.075-0.1 mm) thick,<br>
and a piezoelectric film sensor 47 is secured to each<br>
of the beams 41.<br>
The piezoelectric film sensor(s) 47 should be<br>
permanently bonded to the cantilever beam(s) 41, as the<br>
flexing of a beam should flex and strain the film<br>
sensor so as to detect the defect, such as a broken<br>
filament. Figure 3 shows 8 beams 41 and piezoelectric<br>
film sensors 47 for 8 freshly-melt-spun filament<br>
bundles, side-by-side. As will be understood different<br>
configurations may be used, according to the array of<br>
filaments, bundles or yarns that are being forwarded<br>
past the detector device. For instance, for spinning a<br>
large bundle of filaments for a tow and processing into<br>
staple, a single larger cantilever beam may be used to<br>
stretch across the whole filament bundle.<br>
Electronic circuitry for the piezoelectric film<br>
sensor may be as described by Atochem in Product Data<br>
Number 61 (8/91) or in Carenzo et al, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,136,202 or the Kynar® Piezo Film Technical Manual<br>
(and Product Summary and Price List) referred tc<br>
therein, and is also described in Weidmann et al., U.S.<br>
patent No. 4,133,207 (for a ceramic-type<br><br><br>
piezoelectrical transducer), and is not shown in<br>
Figures 2 and 3, except for an electrical conductor 50<br>
to a source of electrical power supply. In other<br>
words, suitable electronic circuitry is available<br>
commercially.<br>
As indicated, cantilever beams may be made of<br>
stainless steel 3 to 4 mils thick. Such dimensions<br>
have been used successfully to provide low beam<br>
inertia, high resiliency, and high deflection and<br>
signal responses. The width and length of the beams<br>
depend on specific applications and are basically<br>
determined by the width of the filament bundle<br>
(threadline) and the defects involved. Beam widths and<br>
lengths ranging, respectively, from 0.18 to 1 and 0.5<br>
to 1.5 inches (4.5 to 25, and 12 to 40 mm) have been<br>
successfully tested and evaluated on different machine<br>
configurations and products.<br>
Other materials instead of stainless steel may<br>
be used to construct the cantilever beams for desired<br>
sensor characteristics For example, brass and plastic<br>
beams may be used. However, for ease of fabrication<br>
and lower cost, stainless steel beams have proved to be<br>
adequate for typical applications.<br>
The "sensing gap" dimension is adjusted for<br>
different applications as dictated by the thickness of<br>
the filament bundles, and the sensitivity requirements.<br>
In applications, gap sizes ranging from 4 mils to 30<br>
mils (0.1 to 0.8 mm) have been tested successfully for<br>
a variety of product lines. The gap will generally,<br>
depending on the sensitivity desired, be 2 to 3 times<br>
the width of the filament bundle. Typical threadlines<br>
may be 1-3 mils (25-75 microns) thick. Generally, if<br>
practical, for maximum sensitivity it may be desirable<br>
to have a yarn bundle spread out on the guide, so as to<br>
present only one filament thickness, but this may not<br><br>
always be practical, especially when melt-spinning<br>
large filament bundles, e.g., for staple.<br>
The operative parts of the sensing device,<br>
i.e., the piezoelectric film sensor(s) 47 (and,<br>
desirably, cantilever beam(s) 41) are preferably water-<br>
proofed, e.g., coated with a suitable waterproofing<br>
material. I have found it very important in practice,<br>
for melt-spinning applications, to protect the film<br>
from spin-finish, and I have used a commercially-<br>
available water proofing coating sold under the trade<br>
name Parylene, by Paratronic of Attleboro,<br>
Massachusetts to cover these parts up to base 45. In<br>
addition, the whole device, including base 45, which<br>
contains electronic circuitry, should desirably be<br>
sealed with a suitable material, e.g., a silicone<br>
sealant.<br>
In contrast to attempts to use prior devices,<br>
which did not prove to be satisfactory, I have been<br>
able to detect and record broken filaments in<br>
individual bundles of freshly-melt-spun filaments using<br>
the process and device of my invention, and I have,<br>
thereby, been able to improve the quality of the<br>
resulting yarns as a result of my improved ability to<br>
detect broken filaments and other yarn defects, and,<br>
consequently, my ability to correct the reasons for<br>
such broken filaments and other defects. The improved<br>
yarns (of improved quality) are also provided according<br>
to my invention. Although the object of my invention<br>
and the greatest perceived need has been during melt-<br>
spinning, it will be recognized that my novel broken<br>
filament detector will have wider application in<br>
monitoring and recording defects in other running<br>
threadlines. According to the sensitivity of the<br>
settings of the device, it may be used to monitor<br>
single filament breaks, as I have done, ani/or larger<br>
defects, such as drips, thick places or fused<br><br>

herein described with reference to and as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>
A process and a device for detecting a broken filament in a<br>
multiplicity of filaments are provided, wherein the process<br>
comprises: extruding the molten polymer through spinning<br>
capillaries into filamentary streams; quenching the filamentary<br>
streams with cooling air to harden the streams into filaments;<br>
applying finish to the filaments; sensing and recording the<br>
presence of a broken filament by passing the filaments past a<br>
flexible cantilever beam that is spaced from the filaments at a<br>
predetermined distance from the filaments, and wherein a<br>
piezoelectric film sensor is secured to the beam, and wherein the<br>
film sensor is part of an electric circuit containing also means for<br>
recording electric impulses from the film sensor, whereby impact<br>
from a filament defect on the beam will cause the beam to flex and<br>
stretch the film sensor, and will initiate an electric impulse from<br>
the film sensor in the electric circuit, and wherein the electric<br>
impulse is recorded to detect the broken filament.</td>
