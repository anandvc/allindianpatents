RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application claims priority of a provisional application, U.S.<br>
Ser. No. 60/318,536 which was filed on September 10,2001.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to silicone hydrogels that contain internal wetting<br>
agents, as well as methods for their production and use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since<br>
at least the 1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials and<br>
as such were somewhat uncomfortable to users. Modern lenses have been<br>
developed that are made of softer materials, typically hydrogels and<br>
particularly silicone hydrogels. Silicone hydrogels are water-swollen polymer<br>
networks that have high oxygen permeability and surfaces that are more<br>
hydrophobic than hydrophilic. These lenses provide a good level of comfort to<br>
many lens wearers, but there are some users who experience discomfort and<br>
excessive ocular deposits leading to reduced visual acuity when using these<br>
lenses. This discomfort and deposits has been attributed to the hydrophobic<br>
character of the surfaces of lenses and the interaction of those surfaces with<br>
the protein, lipids and mucin and the hydrophilic surface of the eye.<br>
Others have tried to alleviate this problem by coating the surface of<br>
silicone hydrogel contact lenses with hydrophilic coatings. For example, it has<br>
been disclosed that silicone hydrogel lenses can be made more compatible<br>
with ocular surfaces by applying plasma coatings to the lens surface.<br>
However, uncoated silicone hydrogel lenses having low incidences of surface<br>
deposits have not been disclosed.<br>
incorporating internal hydrophilic agents (or wetting agents) into a<br>
macromer containing reaction mixture has been disclosed. However, not all<br>
silicone containing macromers display compatibility with hydrophilic polymers.<br>
Modifying the surface of a polymeric article by adding polymerizable<br>
surfactants to a monomer mix used to form the article has also been<br>
disclosed. However, lasting in vivo improvements in wettability and<br>
reductions in surface deposits are not likely.<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or poly-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline have been<br>
added to a hydrogel composition to form an interpenetrating network which<br>
shows a low degree of surface friction, a low dehydration rate and a high<br>
degree of biodeposit resistance. However, the hydrogel formulations<br>
disclosed are conventional hydrogels and there is no disclosure on how to<br>
incorporate hydrophobic components, such as siloxane monomers, without<br>
losing monomer compatibility.<br>
While it may be possible to incorporate high molecular weight polymers<br>
as internal wetting agents into silicone hydrogel lenses, such polymers are<br>
difficult to solubilize in reaction mixtures which contain silicones. In order to<br>
solubilize these wetting agents, silicone macromers or other prepolymers<br>
must be used. These silicone macromers or prepolymers must be prepared<br>
in a separate step and then subsequently mixed with the remaining<br>
ingredients of the silicone hydrogel formulation. This additional step (or steps)<br>
increases the cost and the time it takes to produce these lenses.<br>
Therefore it would be advantageous to find a lens formulation that does<br>
not require the use of surface treatment to provide on eye wettability and<br>
resistance to surface depositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a wettable silicone hydrogel<br>
comprising the reaction product of at least one siloxane containing macromer;<br>
at least one high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer; and at least one<br>
compatibilizing component.<br>
The present invention further relates to a.ethod comprising the steps of<br>
(a) mixing reactive components comprising at least one high molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer, at least one siloxane containing macromer and an<br>
effective amount of at least one compatibilizing component and (b) curing the<br>
product of step (a) to form a biomedical device.<br>
The present invention further comprises a method comprising the steps of (a)<br>
mixing reactive components comprising a high molecular weight hydrophilic<br>
polymer and an effective amount of a compatibilizing component and (b)<br>
curing the product of step (a) at or above a minimum gel time, to form a<br>
wettable biomedical device.<br>
The present invention yet further relates to an ophthalmic lens<br>
comprising a siiicone hydrogei which has, without surface treatment, a tear<br>
film break up time of at least about 7 seconds<br>
The present invention still further relates to a siiicone hydrogei contact<br>
lens comprising at least one oxygen permeable component, at least one<br>
compatibilizing component and an amount of high molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer sufficient to provide said device, without a surface<br>
treatment, with tear film break up time after about one day of wear of at least<br>
about 7 seconds.<br>
A device comprising a siiicone hydrogei contact lens which is substantially<br>
free from surface deposition without surface modification.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A biomedical device formed from a reaction mixture comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, or consisting of a siiicone containing macromer, at<br>
least one high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer and a compatibilizing<br>
amount of a compatibilizing component.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that biomedical devices, and particularly<br>
ophthalmic devices having exceptional in vivo or clinical wettability, without<br>
surface modification may be made by including an effective amount of a high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymer and a compatibilizing amount of a<br>
compatibilizing component in a siiicone hydrogei formulation. By exceptional<br>
wettability we mean a decrease in advancing dynamic contact angle of at<br>
least about 10% and preferably at least about 20% in some embodiments at<br>
least about 50% as compared to a similar formulation without any hydrophilic<br>
polymer. Prior to the present invention ophthalmic devices formed from<br>
siiicone hydrogels either had to be surface modified to provide clinical<br>
wettability or be formed from at least one siiicone containing macromer having<br>
hydroxyl functionality.<br>
As used herein, a "biomedical device" is any article that is designed to<br>
be used while either in or on mammalian tissues or fluid and preferably on or<br>
in human tissues or fluid. Examples of these devices include but are not<br>
limited to catheters, implants, stents, and ophthalmic devices such as<br>
intraocular lenses and contact lenses. The preferred biomedical devices are<br>
ophthalmic devices, particularly contact lenses, most particularly contact<br>
lenses made from silicone hydrogels.<br>
As used herein, the terms "lens" and "opthalmic device" refer to<br>
devices that reside in or on the eye. These devices can provide optical<br>
correction, wound care, drug delivery, diagnostic functionality or cosmetic<br>
enhancement or effect or a combination of these properties. The term lens<br>
includes but is not limited to soft contact lenses, hard contact lenses,<br>
intraocular lenses, overlay lenses, ocular inserts, and optical inserts.<br>
As used herein the term "monomer" is a compound containing at least<br>
one polymerizable group and an average molecular weight of about less than<br>
2000 Daltons, as measure via gel permeation chromatography refractive<br>
index detection.. Thus, monomers, include dimers and in some cases<br>
oligomers, including oligomers made from more than one monomeric unit.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "without a surface treatment" means that<br>
the exterior surfaces of the devices of the present invention are not separately<br>
treated to improve the wettability of the device. Treatments which may be<br>
foregone because of the present invention include, plasma treatments,<br>
grafting, coating and the like. However, coatings which provide properties<br>
other than improved wettability, such as, but not limited to antimicrobial<br>
coatings may be applied to devices of the present invention.<br>
Various molecular weight ranges are disclosed herein. For compounds<br>
having discrete molecular structures, the molecular weights reported herein<br>
are calculated based upon the molecular formula and reported in gm/mol. For<br>
polymers molecular weights (number average) are measured via gel<br>
permeation chromatography refractive index detection and reported in Daltons<br>
or are measured via kinematic viscosity measurements, as described in<br>
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, N-Vinyl Amide Polymers,<br>
Second edition, Vol 17, pgs. 198-257, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. and reported in<br>
K-values.<br>
High Molecular Weight HydroDhilic Polymer<br>
As used herein, "high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer" refers to<br>
substances having a weight average molecular weight of no less than about<br>
100,000 Daltons, wherein said substances upon incorporation to silicone<br>
hydrogel formulations, improve the wettability of the cured silicone hydrogels.<br>
The preferred weight average molecular weight of these high molecular<br>
weight hydrophilic polymers is greater than about 150,000 Daltons; more<br>
preferably between about 150,000 to about 2,000,000 Daltons, more<br>
preferably still between about 300,000 to about 1,800,000 Daltons, most<br>
preferably about 500,000 to about 1,500,000 Daltons (all weight average<br>
molecular weight).<br>
Alternatively, the molecular weight of hydrophilic polymers of the<br>
invention can be also expressed by the K-value, based on kinematic viscosity<br>
measurements, as described in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and<br>
Engineering, N-Vinyl Amide Polymers, Second edition, Vol 17, pgs. 198-257,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. When expressed in this manner, hydrophilic<br>
monomers having K-values of greater than about 46 and preferably between<br>
about 46 and about 150. The high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers are<br>
present in the formulations of these devices in an amount sufficient to provide<br>
contact lenses, which without surface modification remain substantially free<br>
from surface depositions during use. Typical use periods include at least<br>
about 8 hours, and preferably worn several days in a row, and more<br>
preferably for 24 hours or more without removal. Substantially free from<br>
surface deposition means that, when viewed with a slit lamp, at least about<br>
80% and preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably about 100% of<br>
the lenses worn in the patient population display depositions rated as none or<br>
slight, over the wear period.<br>
Suitable amounts of high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer include<br>
from about 1 to about 15 weight percent, more preferably about 3 to about 15<br>
percent, most preferably about 5 to about 12 percent, all based upon the total<br>
weight of all reactive components.<br>
Examples of high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers include but<br>
are not limited to polyamides, polylactones, polyimides, polylactams and<br>
functionalized polyamides, polylactones, polyimides, polylactams, such as<br>
DMA functionalized by copolymerizing DMA with a lesser molar amount of a<br>
hydroxyl-functional monomer such as HEMA, and then reacting the hydroxyl<br>
groups of the resulting copolymer with materials containing radical<br>
polymerizable groups, such as isocyanatoethylmethacrylate or methacryloyl<br>
chloride. Hydrophilic prepolymers made from DMA or N-vinyl pyrrolidone with<br>
glycidyl methacrylate may also be used. The glycidyl methacrylate ring can<br>
be opened to give a diol which may be used in conjunction with other<br>
hydrophilic prepolymer in a mixed system to increase the compatibility of the<br>
high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer, hydroxyl-functionalized silicone<br>
containing monomer and any other groups which impart compatibility. The<br>
preferred high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers are those that contain a<br>
cyclic moiety in their backbone, more preferably, a cyclic amide or cyclic<br>
imide. High molecular weight hydrophilic polymers include but are not limited<br>
to poly-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-2- piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-2-<br>
caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2- caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2-<br>
piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2- piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2-<br>
caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-ethyl-2- pyrrolidone, and poly-N-vinyl-4,5-<br>
dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone, polyvinylimidazole, poly-N-N-dimethylacrylamide,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid, polyethylene oxide, poly 2 ethyl oxazoline,<br>
heparin polysaccharides, polysaccharides, mixtures and copolymers<br>
(including block or random, branched, multichain, comb-shaped or star<br>
shaped) thereof where poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is particularly preferred.<br>
Copolymers might also be used such as graft copolymers of PVP.<br>
The high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers provide improved<br>
wettability, and particularly improved in vivo wettability to the medical devices<br>
of the present invention. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed<br>
that the high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers are hydrogen bond<br>
receivers which in aqueous environments, hydrogen bond to water, thus<br>
becoming effectively more hydrophilic. The absence of water facilitates the<br>
incorporation of the hydrophilic polymer in the reaction mixture. Aside from<br>
the specifically named high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers, it is<br>
expected that any high molecular weight polymer will be useful in this<br>
invention provided that when said polymer is added to a silicone hydrogel<br>
formulation, the hydrophilic polymer (a) does not substantially phase separate<br>
from the reaction mixture and (b) imparts wettability to the resulting cured<br>
polymer. In some embodiments it is preferred that the high molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer be soluble in the diluent at processing temperatures.<br>
Manufacturing processes which use water or water soluble diluents may be<br>
preferred due to their simplicity and reduced cost. In these embodiments high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymers which are water soluble at processing<br>
temperatures are preferred.<br>
Compatibilizing Component<br>
As used herein a "compatibilizing component" is a compound having a<br>
number average molecular weight of about less than 5000 Daltons, and<br>
preferably less than about 3000 Daltons, and containing at least one<br>
polymerizable group, which is capable of solubilizing the selected reactive<br>
components. Without a compatibilizing component the high molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer and oxygen permeable components are insufficiently<br>
miscible, and cannot, with reasonable processing conditions, form an optically<br>
transparent ophthalmic device. The compatibilizing component of the present<br>
invention solubilizes the oxygen permeable component(s) and high molecular<br>
weight hydrophilic polymer via hydrogen bonding, dispersive forces,<br>
combinations thereof and the like. Thus any functionality which reacts in any<br>
of these ways with the hydrophilic polymer may be used as a compatibilizing<br>
component. Macromers (number average molecular weights of between<br>
about 5000 and about 15,000 Daltons) may also be used so long as they<br>
have the compatibilizing functionality described herein. If a compatibilizing<br>
macromer is used it may still be necessary to add an additional<br>
compatibilizing component to get the desired level of wettability in,the<br>
resulting ophthalmic device.<br>
One suitable class of compatibilizing components of the present<br>
invention comprise at least one active hydrogen and at least one siloxane<br>
group. An active hydrogen has the ability to hydrogen bond with the<br>
hydrophilic polymer and any hydrophilic monomers present. Hydroxyl groups<br>
readily participate in hydrogen bonding and are therefore a preferred source<br>
of active hydrogens. Thus, in one embodiment, the compatibilizing<br>
components of the present invention beneficially comprise at least one<br>
hydroxyl group and at least one "-Si-O-Si-"group. It is preferred that silicone<br>
and its attached oxygen account for more than about 10 weight percent of<br>
said compatibilizing component, more preferably more than about 20 weight<br>
percent.<br>
The ratio of Si to OH in the compatibilizing component is also important<br>
to providing a compatibilzing component which will provide the desired degree<br>
of compatibilization. If the ratio of hydrophobic portion to OH is too high, the<br>
compatibilizing component may be poor at compatibilizing the hydrophilic<br>
polymer, resulting in incompatible reaction mixtures. Accordingly, in some<br>
embodiments, the Si to OH ratio is less than about 15:1, and preferably<br>
between about 1:1 to about 10:1. In some embodiments primary alcohols<br>
have provided improved compatibility compared to secondary alcohols.<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the amount and selection of<br>
compatibilizing component will depend on how much hydrophilic polymer is<br>
needed to achieve the desired wettability and the degree to which the silicone<br>
containing monomer is incompatible with the hydrophilic polymer.<br>
Examples of compatibilizing components include monomers of<br>

Additional suitable compatibilizing components are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 4,235,985 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable compatibilizing components may also comprise silicone<br>
containing macromers which have been modified to include compatibilizing<br>
functionality as defined above. Such macromers comprise substantial<br>
quantities of both Si and HB groups as defined, above, or active hydrogen<br>
functionality, such as hydroxyl groups. One class of suitable macromers<br>
include hydroxyl functionalized macromers made by Group Transfer<br>
Polymerization (GTP), or styrene functionalized prepolymers of hydroxyl<br>
functional methacrylates and silicone methacrylates and are disclosed in<br>
US6,367,929, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the present<br>
ivention, these macromers are preferably used with another compatibilizing<br>
component, such as a siloxane containing monomer. Other macromers, such<br>
as those made by radical polymerization or condensation reaction may also<br>
be used independently or in combination with other compatibilizing<br>
components so long as the Si to hydrogen molar ratio (OH) of the macromer<br>
is less than about 15:1, and preferably between about 1:1 to about 10:1 or the<br>
Si to HB molar ratio is less than about 10:1 and preferably between about 1:1<br>
and about 8:1. However, those of skill in the art will appreciate that including<br>
difluoromethylene groups will decrease the molar ratio suitable for providing<br>
compatibility.<br>
Suitable monofunctional compatibilizing components are commercially<br>
available from Gelest, Inc. Morrisville, PA. Suitable multifunctional<br>
compatibilizing components are commercially available from Gelest, Inc,<br>
Morrisville, PA or may be made using the procedures disclosed in 5,994,488<br>
and 5,962,548. Suitable PEG type monofunctional compatibilizing<br>
components may be made using the procedures disclosed in<br>
PCT/JP02/02231.<br>
Suitable compatibilizing macromers may be made using the general<br>
procedure disclosed in US 5,760,100 (material C) or US 6,367,929.<br>
While compatibiiizing components comprising hydroxyl functionality<br>
have been found to be particularly suitable for providing compatible polymers<br>
for biomedical devices, and particulalrly ophthalmic devices, any<br>
compatibilizing component which, when polymerized and/or formed into a final<br>
article is compatible with the selected hydrophilic components may be used.<br>
Compatibilizing components may be selected using the following monomer<br>
compatibility test. In this test one gram of each of mono-3-methacryloxypropyl<br>
terminated, mono-butyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (mPDMS MW 800-<br>
1000) and a monomer to be tested are mixed together in one gram of 3,7-<br>
dimethyl-3-octanol at about 20°C. A mixture of 12 weight parts K-90 PVP and<br>
60 weight parts DMA is added drop-wise to hydrophobic component solution,<br>
with stirring, until the solution remains cloudy after three minutes of stirring.<br>
The mass of the added blend of PVP and DMA is determined in grams and<br>
recorded as the monomer compatibility index. Any compatibilizing component<br>
having a compatibility index of greater than 0.5 grams, more preferably<br>
greater than about 1 grams and most preferably greater than about 1.5 grams<br>
will be suitable for use in this invention. Those of skill in the art will appreciate<br>
that the molecular weight of the active compatibilizing component will effect<br>
the results of the above test. Compatibilizing components having molecular<br>
weights greater than about 800 daltons may need to mix for longer periods of<br>
time to give representative results.<br>
An "effective amount" of the compatibilizing component of the invention<br>
is the amount needed to compatibilize or dissolve the high molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer and the other components of the polymer formulation.<br>
Thus, the amount of compatibilizing component will depend in part on the<br>
amount of hydrophilic polymer which is used, with more compatibilizing<br>
component being needed to compatibilize higher concentrations of high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymer. Effective amounts of compatibilizing<br>
component in the polymer formulation include about 5% (weight percent,<br>
based on the total weight of the reactive components) to about 90 %,<br>
preferably about 10% to about 80%, most preferably, about 20% to about<br>
50%.<br>
In addition to the high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers and the<br>
compatibilizing components of the invention other hydrophilic monomers,<br>
oxygen permeability enhancing components, crosslinkers, additives, diluents,<br>
polymerization initators may be used to prepare the biomedical devices of the<br>
invention.<br>

prepolymers, fluorine containing monomers, macromers and reactive<br>
prepolymers and carbon-carbon triple bond containing monomers, macromers<br>
and reactive prepolmers and combinations thereof, but exclude the<br>
compatibilizing component. For the purposes of this invention, the term<br>

macromers, and mixtures thereof<br>
Suitable siloxane containing monomers include, amide analogs of TRIS<br>

macromers may be formed via the polymerization of one or more siloxanes<br>
with one or more acrylic or methacrylic materials. Siloxane containing<br>
macromers may be formed via group transfer polymerization ("GTP"), free<br>
radical polymerization, condensation reactions and the like. The siloxane<br>
containing macromers may be formed in one or a series of steps depending<br>
on the components selected and using conditions known in the art. Specific<br>
siloxane containing macromers, and methods for their manufucture, include<br>
those disclosed in US 5,760,100 as materials A-D (methacrylate<br>
functionalized, silicone-fluoroether urethanes and methacrylate functionalized,<br>

US 5,070215 and urethane based prepolymers comprising alternating "hard"<br>
segments formed from the reaction of short chained diols and diisocyantes<br>
and "soft" segments formed from a relatively high molecular weight polymer,<br>
which is a,w endcapped with two active hydrogens. Specific examples of<br>
suitable siloxane containing prepolymers, and methods for their manufacture,<br>
are disclosed in US 5,034,461, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The hydrogels of the present invention may comprise at least one<br>

present in amounts between about 5 and about 50 weight%, preferably<br>
between about 10 and about 50 weight% and more preferably between about<br>

macromers and reactive prepolymers include macromers and prepolymers<br>
which include said flurorine containing monomers.<br>
It has been found that wettability of macromer containing silicone<br>
hydrogels may be improved by including at least one hydrophilic polymer and<br>
a compatibilizing component. Improved wettability includes a decrease in<br>
advancing dynamic contact angle of at least about 10%, and preferably at<br>
least about 20% and in some embodiment a decrease of at least about 50%.<br>
In certain embodiments it may be preferred to use mixtures of siloxane<br>
containing monomers or mixtures of siloxane containing monomers with<br>
siloxane containing macromers or prepolymers.<br>
Hydrophilic Monomers<br>
Additionally, reactive components of the present invention may also<br>
include any hydrophilic monomers used to prepare conventional hydrogels.<br>
For example monomers containing acrylic groups (CH2=CROX, where R is<br>
hydrogen or C1-6alkyl an X is 0 or N) or vinyl groups (-C=CH2) may be used.<br>
Examples of additional hydrophilic monomers are N,N-dimethylacrylamide,<br>

combinations thereof.<br>
Aside the additional hydrophilic monomers mentioned above,<br>
polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl groups<br>
replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable double bond may<br>
be used. Examples include polyethylene glycol, as disclosed in US<br>

5,304,584, and ethoxylated bisphenol A, as disclosed in US5,565,539,<br>
reacted with one or more molar equivalents of an end-capping group such as<br>
isocyanatoethyl methacrylate, methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride,<br>
vinylbenzoyl chloride, and the like, produce a polyethylene polyol having one<br>
or more terminal polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene<br>
polyol through linking moieties such as carbamate, urea or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples include the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl<br>
carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,070,215, the hydrophilic<br>
oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,277, and polydextran.<br>
The preferred additional hydrophilic monomers are N,N-<br>
dimethylacrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP),<br>
polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid and<br>
combinations thereof, with hydrophilic monomers comprising DMA being<br>
particularly preferred. Additional hydrophilic monomers may be present in<br>
amounts of about 0 to about 70 wt%, more preferably of about 5 and about 60<br>
and most preferably of about 10 and 50 weight%, based upon the total weight<br>
of the reactive components.<br>
Crosslinkers<br>
Suitable crosslinkers are compounds with two or more polymerizable<br>
functional groups. The crosslinker may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic and in<br>
some embodiments of the present invention mixtures of hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic crosslinkers have been found to provide silicone hydrogels with<br>
improved optical clarity (reduced haziness compared to a CSI Thin Lens®).<br>
Examples of suitable hydrophilic crosslinkers include compounds having two<br>
or more polymerizable functional groups, as well as hydrophilic functional<br>
groups such as polyether, amide or hydroxyl groups. Specific examples<br>
include TEGDMA (tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate), TrEGDMA<br>
(triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate), ethyleneglycol dimethacylate (EGDMA),<br>
ethylenediamine dimethyacrylamide, glycerol dimethacrylate and<br>
combinations thereof Examples of suitable hydrophobic crosslinkers include<br>
multifunctional compatibilizing component, multifunctional polyether-<br>
polydimethylsiloxane block copolymers, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Specific hydrophobic crosslinkers include acryloxypropyl terminated<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (n= 10 or 20) (acPOMS), hydroxylacrylate functionalized<br>
siloxane macromer, methacryloxypropyl terminated PDMS, butanediol<br>
dimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, 1,3-bis(3-<br>
methacryloxypropyl)tetrakis(trimethylsiloxy) disiloxane and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred crosslinkers include TEGDMA, EGDMA, acPDMS and combinations<br>
thereof. The amount of hydrophilic crosslinker used is generally about 0 to<br>
about 2 weight% and preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 weight % and the<br>
amount of hydrophobic crosslinker is about 0 to about 0 to about 5 weight %<br>
based upon the total weight of the reactive components, which can<br>
alternatively be referred to in mol% of about 0.01 to about 0.2 mmole/gm<br>
reactive components, preferably about 0.02 to about 0.1 and more preferably<br>
0.03 to about 0.6 mmole/gm.<br>
Increasing the level of crosslinker in the final polymer has been found<br>
to reduce the amount of haze. However, as crosslinker concentration<br>
increases above about 0.15 mmole/gm reactive components modulus<br>
increases above generally desired levels (greater than about 90 psi). Thus, in<br>
the present invention the crosslinker composition and amount is selected to<br>
provide a crosslinker concentration in the reaction mixture of between about 1<br>
and about 10 mmoles crosslinker per 100 grams of reactive components.<br>
Additional components or additives, which are generally known in the<br>
art may also be included. Additives include but are not limited to ultra-violet<br>
absorbing compounds and monomer, reactive tints, antimicrobial compounds,<br>
pigments, photochromic, release agents, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Diluents<br>
The reactive components (compatibilizing component, hydrophilic<br>
polymer, oxygen permeable components, hydrophilic monomers,<br>
crosslinker(s) and other components) are mixed and reacted in the absence<br>
of water and optionally, in the presence of at least one diluent to form a<br>
reaction mixture. The type and amount of diluent used also effects the<br>
properties of the resultant polymer and article. The haze and wettability of the<br>
final article may be improved by selecting relatively hydrophobic diluents<br>
and/or decreasing the concentration of diluent used. As discussed above,<br>
increasing the hydrophobicity of the diluent may also allow poorly compatible<br>
components (as measured by the compatibility test) to be processed to form a<br>
compatible polymer and article. However, as the diluent becomes more<br>
hydrophobic, processing steps necessary to replace the diluent with water will<br>
require the use of solvents other than water. This may undesirably increase<br>
the complexity and cost of the manufacturing process. Thus, it is important to<br>
select a diluent which provides the desired compatibility to the components<br>
with the necessary level of processing convenience. Diluents useful in<br>
preparing the devices of this invention include ethers, esters, alkanes, alkyi<br>
halides, silanes, amides, alcohols and combinations thereof. Amides and<br>
alcohols are preferred diluents, and secondary and tertiary alcohols are most<br>
preferred alcohol diluents. Examples of ethers useful as diluents for this<br>
invention include tetrahydrofuran, tripropylene glycol methyl ether,<br>
dipropylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol n-butyl ether, diethyiene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol phenyl<br>
ether, propytene glycol methyl ether, propylene giycol methyl ether acetate,<br>

glycol n-butyl ether, dipropylene glycol n-butyl ether, tripropylene glycol n-<br>
butyl ether, propylene glycol phenyl ether dipropylene glycol dimetyl ether,<br>
polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols and mixtures thereof. Examples<br>
of esters useful for this invention include ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl<br>
acetate, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, i-propyl lactate. Examples of alkyl<br>
halides useful as diluents for this invention include methylene chloride.<br>
Examples of silanes useful as diluents for this invention include<br>
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.<br>
Examples of alcohols useful as diluents for this invention include those<br>
having the formula<br><br>
wherein Where R, R' and R" are independently selected from H, a linear,<br>
branched or cyclic monovalent alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons which may<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more groups including halogens, ethers,<br>
esters, aryls, aminos, amides, alkenes, alkynes, carboxylic acids, alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones or the like, or any two or all three of R, R and R" can<br>
together bond to form one or more cyclic structures, such as alkyl having 1<br>
to10 carbons which may also be substituted as just described, with the<br>
proviso that no more than one of R, R' or R" is H.<br>
It is preferred that R, R' and R" are independently selected from H or<br>
unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic alkyl groups having 1 to 7 carbons. It<br>
is more preferred that R, R', and R" are independently selected form<br>
unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic alkyl groups having 1 to 7 carbons, in<br>
certain embodiments, the preferred diluent has 4 or more, more preferably 5<br>
or more total carbons, because the higher molecular weight diluents have<br>
lower volatility, and lower flammability. When one of the R, R' and R" is H, the<br>
structure forms a secondary alcohol. When none of the R, R' and R" are H,<br>
the structure forms a tertiary alcohol. Tertiary alcohols are more preferred<br>
than secondary alcohols. The diluents are preferably inert and easily<br>
displaceable by water when the total number of carbons is five or less.<br>
Examples of useful secondary alcohols include 2-butanol, 2-propanol,<br>
menthol, cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol and exonorbomeol, 2-pentanol, 3-<br>

phenyl-2-propanol and 3-ethyl-3-pentanol, and the like.<br>
A single alcohol or mixtures of two or more of the above-listed alcohols or<br>
two or more alcohols according to the structure above can be used as the<br>
diluent to make the polymer of this invention.<br>
In certain embodiments, the preferred alcohol diluents are secondary and<br>
tertiary alcohols having at least 4 carbons. The more preferred alcohol<br>
diluents include tert-butanol, tert-amyl alcohol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol,<br>
2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, 3-ethyl-3-pentanol, 3,7-dirnethyl-<br>
3-octanol.<br>
Presently, the most preferred diluents are hexanol, heptanol, octanol,<br>
nonanol, decanol, tert-butyl alcohol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, isopropanol, t amyl<br>
alcohol, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, i-propyl lactate, 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol,<br>
dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl propionamide, N methyl<br>
pyrrolidinone and mixtures thereof. Additional diluents useful for this invention<br>
are disclosed in US patent 6,020,445, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the diluent is water soluble<br>
at processing conditions and readily washed out of the lens with water in a<br>
short period of time. Suitable water soluble diluents include 1-ethoxy-2-<br>
propanol, 1-methyl-2-propanol, t-amyl alcohol, tripropylene glycol methyl<br>
ether, isopropanol, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylpropionamide, ethyl<br>
lactate, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, mixtures thereof and the like. The<br>
use of a water soluble diluent allows the post molding process to be<br>
conducted using water only or aqueous solutions which comprise water as a<br>
substantial component.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount of diluent is generally less than about<br>
50 weight % of the reaction mixture and preferably less than about 40<br>
weight% and more preferably between about 10 and about 30 weight %<br>
based upon the total weight of the components of the reaction mixture.<br>
The diluent may also comprise additional components such as release<br>
agents. Suitable release agents are water soluble and aid in lens deblocking<br>
The polymerization initiators includes compounds such as lauryl<br>
peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, isopropyl percarbonate, azobisisobutyronitrile,<br>
and the like, that generate free radicals at moderately elevated temperatures,<br>
and photoinitiator systems such as aromatic alpha-hydroxy ketones,<br>
alkoxyoxybenzoins, acetophenones, acyl phosphine oxides, and a tertiary<br>
amine plus a diketone, mixtures thereof and the like. Illustrative examples of<br>
photoinitiators are 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-<br>
phenyl-propan-1-one,bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl<br>
phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-<br>
phenylphosphineoxide (Irgacure 819), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyldiphenyl<br>
phosphine oxide, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyoyl diphenylphosphine oxide, benzoin<br>
methyl ester.and a combination of camphorquinone and ethyl 4-(N,N-<br>
dimethylamino)benzoate. Commercially available visible light initiator<br>
systems include Irgacure 819, Irgacure 1700, Irgacure 1800, Irgacure 1850<br>
(all from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and Lucirin TPO initiator (available from<br>
BASF). Commercially available UV photoinitiators include Darocur 1173 and<br>
Darocur 2959 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals). The initiator is used in the reaction<br>
mixture in effective amounts to initiate photopolymerization of the reaction<br>
mixture, e.g., from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of<br>
reactive monomer. Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated<br>
using the appropriate choice of heat or visible or ultraviolet light or other<br>
means depending on the polymerization initiator used. Alternatively, initiation<br>
can be conducted without a photoinitiator using, for example, e-beam.<br>
However, when a photoinitiator is used, the preferred initiator is a combination<br>
of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-<br>
trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), and the preferred method of<br>
polymerization initiation is visible light. The most preferred is bis(2,4,6-<br>
trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide (Irgacure 819).<br>
The preferred range of all silicone containing components (oxygen<br>

components.<br>
A preferred range of diluent is from about 0 to about 70 weight percent,<br>
more preferably about 0 to about 50 weight percent, and still more preferably<br>

components.<br>

ethanol, 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol.<br>
Processing<br>
The biomedical devices of the invention are prepared by mixing the<br>
high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer, the compatibilizing component,<br>
plus one or more of the following: the oxygen permeability enhancing<br>
component, the hydrophilic monomers, the additives ("reactive components"),<br>
and the diluents ("reaction mixture"), with a polymerization initator and curing<br>
by appropriate conditions to form a product that can be subsequently formed<br>
into the appropriate shape by lathing, cutting and the like. Alternatively, the<br>
reaction mixture may be placed in a mold and subsequently cured into the<br>
appropriate article.<br>
Various processes are known for curing the reaction mixture in the<br>
production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting.<br>
Spincasting methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,408,429 and<br>
3,660,545, and static casting methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred method for producing contact lenses<br>
comprising the polymer of this invention is by the direct molding of the silicone<br>
hydrogels, which is economical, and enables precise control over the final<br>
shape of the hydrated lens. For this method, the reaction mixture is placed in<br>
a mold having the shape of the final desired silicone hydrogel, i.e., water-<br>
swollen polymer, and the reaction mixture is subjected to conditions whereby<br>
the monomers polymerize, to thereby produce a polymer/diluent mixture in the<br>
shape of the final desired product. Then, this polymer/diluent mixture is<br>
treated with a solvent to remove the diluent and ultimately replace it with<br>
water, producing a silicone hydrogel having a final size and shape which are<br>
quite similar to the size and shape of the original molded polymer/diluent<br>
article. This method can be used to form contact lenses and is further<br>
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,495,313; 4,680,336; 4,889,664; and 5,039,459,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Curing<br>
Yet another feature of the present invention is a process for curing<br>
silicone hydrogel formulations to provide enhanced wettability. It has been<br>
found that the gel time for a silicone hydrogel may be used to select cure<br>
conditions which provide a wettable ophthalmic device, and specifically a<br>
contact lens. The gel time is the time at which a crosslinked polymer network<br>
is formed, resulting in the viscosity of the curing reaction mixture approaching<br>
infinity and the reaction mixture becoming non-fluid. The gel point occurs at a<br>
specific degree of conversion, independent of reaction conditions, and<br>
therefore can be used as an indicator of the rate of the reaction. It has been<br>
found that, for a given reaction mixture, the gel time may be used to<br>
determine cure conditions which impart desirable wettability. Thus, in a<br>
process of the present invention, the reaction mixture is cured at or above a<br>
gel time that provides improved wettability, or more preferably sufficient<br>
wettability for the resulting device to be used without a hydrophilic coating or<br>
surface treatment ("minimum gel time"). Preferably improved wettability is a<br>
decrease in advancing dynamic contact angle of at least 10% compared to<br>
formulation with no high molecular weight polymer. Longer gel times are<br>
preferred as they provide improved wettability and increased processing<br>
flexibility.<br>
Gel times will vary for different silicone hydrogel formulations. Cure<br>
conditions also effect gel time. For example the concentration of crosslinker<br>
will impact gel time, increasing crosslinker concentrations decreases gel time.<br>
Increasing the intensity of the radiation (for photopolymerization) or<br>
temperature (for thermal polymerization), the efficiency of initiation (either by<br>
selecting a more efficient initiator or irradiation source, or an initiator which<br>
absorbs more strongly in the selected irradiation range) will also decrease gel<br>
time. Temperature and diluent type and concentration also effect gel time in<br>
ways understood by those of skill in the art.<br>
The minimum gel time may be determined by selecting a given<br>
formulation, varying one of the above factors and measuring the gel time and<br>
contact angles. The minimum gel time is the point above which the resulting<br>
lens is generally wettable. Below the minimum gel time the lens is generally<br>
not wettable. For a contact lens "generally wettable" is a lens which displays<br>
an advancing dynamic contact angle of less than about 70 and preferably less<br>
than about 60° or a contact lens which displays a tear film break up time equal<br>
to or better than an ACUVUE® lens. Thus, those of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that minimum gel point as defined herein may be a range, taking<br>
into consideration statistical experimental variability.<br>
In certain embodiments using visible light irradiation minimum<br>
gel times of at least about 30, preferably greater than about 35, and more<br>
preferably greater than about 40 seconds have been found to be<br>
advantageous.<br>
Curing may be conducted using heat, ionizing or actinic radiation, for<br>
example electron beams, Xrays, UV or visible light, ie. electromagnetic<br>
radiation or particle radiation having a wavelength in the range of from about<br>
150 to about 800 nm. Preferable radiation sources include UV or visible light<br>
having a wavelength of about 250 to about 700 nm. Suitable radiation<br>
sources include UV lamps, fluorescent lamps, incandescent lamps, mercury<br>
vapor lamps, and sunlight. In embodiments where a UV absorbing compound<br>
is included in the reaction mixture (for example, as a UV block or<br>
photochromic) curing is conducting by means other than UV irradiation (such<br>
as by visible light or heat). In a preferred embodiment the radiation source is<br>
selected from UVA (about 315 - about 400 nm), UVB (about 280-about 315)<br>
or visible light (about 400 -about 450 nm). In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the reaction mixture includes a UV absorbing compound, is cured using<br>
visible light. In many embodiments it will be useful to cure the reaction<br>
mixture at low intensity to achieve the desired minimum gel time. As used<br>
herein the term low intensity" means those between about 0.1 mW/cm2 to<br>
about 6 mW/cm2 and preferably between about 1 mW/cm2 and 3 mW/cm2.<br>
The cure time is long, generally more than about 1 minute and preferably<br>
between about 1 and about 60 minutes and still more preferably between<br>
about 1 and about 30 minutes This slow, low intensity cure is one way to<br>
provide the desired minimum gel times and produce ophthalmic devices which<br>
display good wettability.<br>
Initiator concentration also effects gel time. Accordingly, in some<br>
embodiments it is preferred to have relatively low amounts of photoinitiator,<br>
generally 1% or less and preferably 0.5% or less.<br>
The temperature at which the reaction mixture is cured is also<br>
important. As the temperature is increased above ambient the haze of the<br>
resulting polymer decreases. Temperatures effective to reduce haze include<br>
temperatures at which the haze for the resulting lens is decreased by at least<br>
about 20% as compared to a lens of the same composition made at 25°C.<br>
Thus, suitable cure temperatures include those greater than about 25°C,<br>
preferably those between about 25°C and 70°C and more preferably those<br>
between about 40°C and 70°C. The precise set of cure conditions<br>
(temperature, intensity and time) will depend upon the components of lens<br>
material selected and, with reference to the teaching herein, are within the<br>
skill of one of ordinary skill in the art to determine. Cure may be conducted in<br>
one or a muptiplicity of cure zones.<br>
The cure conditions must be sufficient to form a polymer network from<br>
the reaction mixture. The resulting polymer network is swollen with the diluent<br>
and has the form of the mold cavity.<br>
Deblocking<br>
After the lenses have been cured they must be removed from the mold.<br>
Unfortunately, the silicone components used in the lens formulation render the<br>
finished lenses "sticky" and difficult to release from the lens molds. Lenses<br>
can be deblocked (removed from the mold half or tool supporting the lens)<br>
using a solvent, such as an organic solvent. However, in one embodiment of<br>
the present invention at least one low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer is<br>
added to the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture is formed into the desired<br>
article, cured and deblocked in water or an aqueous solution comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of and consisting of a small amount of surfactant. The<br>
low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer can be any polymer having a<br>
structure as defined for a high molecular weight polymer, but with a molecular<br>
weight such that the low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer extracts or<br>
leaches from the lens under deblocking conditions to assist in lens release<br>
from the mold. Suitable molecular weights include those less than about<br>
40,000 Daltons and preferably less than about 20,000 Daltons. Those of skill<br>
in the art will appreciate that the foregoing molecular weights are averages,<br>
and that some amount of material having a molecular weight higher than the<br>
given averages may be suitable, so long as the average molecular weight is<br>
within the specified range. Preferably the low molecular weight polymer is<br>
selected from water soluble polyamides, lactams and polyethylene glycols,<br>
and mixtures thereof and more preferably poly-vinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene<br>
glycols, poly 2 ethyl-2-oxazoline (available from Plymer Chemistry<br>
Innovations, Tuscon, AZ), polymethacrylic acid, poly(1 -lactic acid),<br>
polycaprolactam, polycaprolactone, polycaprolactone diol, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyhema, polyacrylic acid, poly(1-glycerol methacrylate), poiy(2-ethyl-2-<br>
oxazoline), poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate), poly(2-vinylpyridine N-oxide),<br>
polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide and the like.<br>
The low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer may be used in amounts<br>
up to about 20 wt.% and preferably in amounts between about 5 and about 20<br>
wt% of the reactive components.<br>
Suitable surfactants include non-ionic surfactants including betaines,<br>
amine oxides, combinations thereof and the like. Examples of suitable<br>
surfactants include TWEEN® (ICI), DOE 120 (Amerchol/Union Carbide and<br>
the like. The surfactants may be used in amounts up to about 10,000 ppm,<br>
preferably between about 25 ppm and about 1500 ppm and more preferably<br>
between about 100 and about 1200 ppm.<br>
Suitable release agents are low molecular weight, and include 1-<br>
methyl-4-piperidone, 3-morpholino-1,2-propanediol, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ol,<br>
glycerol formal, ethyl-4-oxo-1-piperidine carboxylate, 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-<br>
tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone<br>
Lenses made from reaction mixtures without low molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer may be deblocked in an aqueous solution comprising at<br>
least one organic solvent. Suitable organic solvents are hydrophobic, but<br>
miscible with water. Alcohols, ethers and the like are suitable, more<br>
specifically primary alcohols and more specifically isopropyl alcohol, DPMA,<br>
TPM, OPM, methanol, ethanol, propanol and mixtures thereof being suitable<br>
examples.<br>
Suitable deblocking temperatures range from about ambient to about<br>
100°C, preferably between about 70°C and 95°C, with higher temperatures<br>
providing quicker deblocking times. Agitation, such as by sonication, may<br>
also be used to decrease deblocking times. Other means known in the art,<br>
such as vacuum nozzles may also be used to remove the lenses from the<br>
molds.<br>
Diluent replacement/hydration<br>
Typically after curing the reaction mixture, the resulting polymer is<br>
treated with a solvent to remove the diluent (if used), unreacted components,<br>
byproducts, and the like and hydrate the polymer to form the hydrogel.<br>
Alternatively, depending on the solubility characteristics of the hydrogel's<br>
components, the solvent initially used can be an organic liquid such as<br>
ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, TPM, DPM, PEGs, PPGs, glycerol, mixtures<br>
thereof, or a mixture of one or more such organic liquids with water, followed<br>
by extraction with pure water (or physiological saline). The organic liquid may<br>
also be used as a "pre-soak". After demolding, lenses may be briefly soaked<br>
(times up to about 30 minutes, preferably between about 5 and about 30<br>
minutes) in the organic liquid or a mixture of organic liquid and water. After<br>
the pre-soak, the lens may be further hydrated using aqueous extraction<br>
solvents.<br>
In some embodiments, the preferred process uses an extraction<br>
solvent that is predominately water, preferably greater than 90% water, more<br>
preferably greater than 97% water. Other components may includes salts<br>
such as sodium chloride, sodium borate boric acid, DPM, TPM, ethanol or<br>
isopropanol. Lenses are generally released from the molds into this<br>
extraction solvent, optionally with stirring or a continuous flow of the extraction<br>
solvent over the lenses. This process can be conducted at temperatures from<br>
2 to 121°C, preferably from 20 to 98 °C. The process can be conducted at<br>
elevated pressures, particularly when using temperatures in excess of 100°C,<br>
but is more typically conducted at ambient pressures. It is possible to deblock<br>
the lenses into one solution (for example containing some release aid) and<br>
then transfer them into another (for example the final packing solution),<br>
although it may also be possible to deblock the lenses into the same solution<br>
in which they are packaged. The treatment of lenses with this extraction<br>
solvent may be conducted for a period of from about 30 seconds to about 3<br>
days, preferably between about 5 and about 30 minutes. The selected<br>
hydration solution may additional comprise small amounts of additives such<br>
as surfactants and/or release aids. Suitable surfactants include include non-<br>
ionic surfactants, such as betaines and amine oxides. Specific surfactants<br>
include TWEEN 80 (available from Amerchol), DOE 120 (available from Union<br>
Carbide), Pluronics, methyl cellulose, mixtures thereof and the like and may<br>
be added in amounts between about 0.01 weight% and about 5% based upon<br>
total weight of hydration solution used.<br>
In one embodiment the lenses may be hydrated using a "step down"<br>
method, where the solvent is replaced in steps over the hydration process.<br>
Suitable step down processes have at least two, at least three and in some<br>
embodiments at least four steps, where a percentage of the solvent is<br>
replaced with water.<br>
The silicone hydrogels after hydration of the polymers preferably<br>
comprise about 10 to about 60 weight percent water, more preferably about<br>
20 to about 55 weight percent water, and most preferably about 25 to about<br>
50 weight percent water of the total weight of the silicone hydrogel. Further<br>
details on the methods of producing silicone hydrogel contact lenses are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,495,313; 4,680,336; 4,889,664; and 5,039,459,<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The cured biomedical device of the present invention displays excellent<br>
resistance to fouling in vivo, even without a coating. When the biomedical<br>
device is an ophthalmic device, resistance to biofouling may be measured by<br>
measuring the amount of surface deposits on the lens during the wear period,<br>
often referred to as lipid deposits".<br>
Lens surface deposits are measured as follows: Lenses were put on<br>
human eyes and evaluated after 30 minutes and one week of wear using a slit<br>
lamp. During the evaluation the patient is asked to blink several times and the<br>
lenses are manually "pushed" in order to differentiate between deposits and<br>
back surface trapped debris. Front and back surface deposits are graded as<br>
being discrete (i.e. jelly bumps) or filmy. Front surface deposits give a bright<br>
reflection while back surface deposits do not. Deposits are differentiated from<br>
back surface trapped debris during a blink or a push-up test. The deposits will<br>
move while the back surface trapped debris will remain still. The deposits are<br>
graded into five categories based upon the percentage of the lens surface<br>
which is effected: none (
6% to about 15%), moderate (about 16% to about 25%) and severe (greater<br>
than about 25%). A10% difference between the categories is considered<br>
clinically significant.<br>
The ophthalmic devices of the present invention also display low haze,<br>
good wettability and modulus.<br>
Haze is measured by placing test lenses in saline in a clear cell above<br>
a black background, illuminating from below with a fiber optic lamp at an angle<br>
66° normal to the lens cell, and capturing an image of the lens from above<br>
with a video camera. The background-subtracted scattered light image was<br>
quantitatively analyzed, by integrating over the central 10 mm of the lens, and<br>
then compared to a -1.00 diopter CSI Thin Lens®, which is arbitrarily set at a<br>
haze value of 100, with no lens set as a haze value of 0.<br>
Wettability is measured by measuring the contact angle or DCA,<br>
typically with borate buffered saline, using a Wilhelmy balance at 23°C. The<br>
wetting force between the lens surface and borate buffered saline is<br>
measured using a Wilhelmy microbalance while the sample is being<br>
immersed into or pulled out of the saline. The following equation is used<br>
F = 2gpcosq or q = cos-1(F/2gp)<br>
where F is the wetting force, y is the surface tension of the probe liquid,<br>
p is the perimeter of the sample at the meniscus and q is the contact angle.<br>
Typically, two contact angles are obtained from a dynamic wetting experiment<br>
- advancing contact angle and receding contact angle. Advancing contact<br>
angle is obtained from the portion of the wetting experiment where the sample<br>
is being immersed into the probe liquid. At least 4 lenses of each composition<br>
are measured and the values reported herein.<br>
However, DCA is not always a good predictor of wettability on eye.<br>
The pre-lens tear film non-invasive break-up time (PLTF-NIBUT) is one<br>
measure of in vivo or "clinical" lens wettability. The PLTF-NIBUT is measured<br>
using a slit lamp and a circular fluorescent tearscope for noninvasive viewing<br>
of the tearfilm (Keeler Tearscope Plus). The time elapsed between the eye<br>
opening after a blink and the appearance of the first dark spot within the tear<br>
film on the front surface of a contact lens is recorded as PLTF-NIBUT. The<br>
PLTF-NIBUT was measured 30-minutes after the lenses were placed on eye<br>
and after one week. Three measurements were taken at each time interval<br>
and were averaged into one reading. The PLTF-NIBUT was measured on<br>
both eyes, beginning with the right eye and then the left eye.<br>
Movement is measured using the "push up" test. The patient's eyes<br>
are in the primary gaze position. The push-up test is a gentle digital push of<br>
the lens upwards using the lower lid. The resistance of the lens to upward<br>
movement is judged and graded according to the following scale: 1<br>
(excessive, unacceptable movement), 2 (moderate, but acceptable<br>
movement), 3 (optimal movement), 4 (minimal, but acceptable movement), 5<br>
(insufficient, unacceptable movement).<br>
The lenses of the present invention display moduli of at least about 30<br>
psi, preferably between about 30 and about 90 psi, and more preferably<br>
between about 40 and about 70 psi. Modulus is measured by using the<br>
crosshead of a constant rate of movement type tensile testing machine<br>
equipped with a load cell that is lowered to the initial gauge height. A suitable<br>
testing machine includes an Instron model 1122. A dog-bone shaped sample<br>
having a 0.522 inch length, 0.276 inch "ear" width and 0.213 inch "neck" width<br>
is loaded into the grips and elongated at a constant rate of strain of 2 in/min.<br>
until it breaks. The initial gauge length of the sample (Lo) and sample length<br>
at break (Lf) are measured. Twelve specimens of each composition are<br>
measured and the average is reported. Tensile modulus is measured at the<br>
initial linear portion of the stress/strain curve.<br>
The contact lenses prepared by this invention have O2 Dk values<br>
between about 40 and about 300 barrer, determined by the polarographic<br>
method. Lenses are positioned on the sensor then covered on the upper side<br>
with a mesh support. The lens is exposed to an atmosphere of humified 2.1%<br>
O2. The oxygen that diffuses through the lens is measured using a<br>
polarographic oxygen sensor consisting of a 4 mm diameter gold cathode and<br>
a silver ring anode. The reference values are those measured on<br>
commercially available contact lenses using this method. Balafilcon A lenses<br>
available from Bausch &amp; Lomb give a measurement of approx. 79 barrer.<br>
Etafilcon lenses give a measurement of 20 to 25 barrer. (1 barrer = 10-10 (cm3<br>
of gas x cm2)/(cm3 of polymer x s x cm Hg).<br>
Gel time was measured using the following method. The photo-<br>
polymerization reaction was monitored with an ATS StressTech rheometer<br>
equipped with a photo-curing accessory, which consists of a temperature-<br>
controlled cell with a quartz lower plate and an aluminum upper plate, and a<br>
radiation delivery system equipped with a bandpass filter. The radiation,<br>
which originates at a Novacure mercury arc lamp equipped with an iris and<br>
computer-controlled shutter, was delivered to the quartz plate in the<br>
rheometer via a liquid light guide. The filter was a 420 nm (20 nm FWHM)<br>
bandpass filter, which simulates the light emitted from a TL03 bulb. The<br>
intensity of the radiation, measured at the surface of the quartz window with<br>
an IL1400A radiometer, was controlled to ± 0.02 mW/cm2 with an iris. The<br>
temperature was controlled at 45 ± 0.1 °C. After approximately 1 mL of the de-<br>
gassed reactive mixture was placed on the lower plate of the rheometer, the<br>
25 mm diameter upper plate was lowered to 0.500 ± 0.001 mm above the<br>
lower plate, where it was held until after the reaction reached the gel point.<br>
The sample was allowed to reach thermal equilibrium (~4 minutes, determined<br>
by the leveling-off of the steady shear viscosity) before the lamp shutter was<br>
opened and the reaction begun. During this time while the sample was<br>
reaching thermal equilibrium, the sample chamber was purged with nitrogen<br>
gas at a rate of 400 seem. During the reaction the rheometer continuously<br>
monitored the strain resulting from an applied dynamic stress (fast oscillation<br>
mode), where time segments of less than a complete cycle were used to<br>
calculate the strain at the applied programmable stress. The computer<br>
calculated the dynamic shear modulus (G1), loss modulus (G"), and viscosity<br>
(v*), as a function of exposure time. As the reaction proceeded the shear<br>
modulus increased from 0.1 MPa, and tan 6 (=G7G') dropped from<br>
near infinity to less than 1. For measurements made herein the gel time is the<br>
time at which tan 5 equals 1 .(the crossover point when G'=G"). At the time<br>
that G' reaches 100 Pa (shortly after the gel point), the restriction on the upper<br>
plate was removed so that the gap between the upper and lower plates can<br>
change as the reactive monomer mix shrinks during cure.<br>
It will be appreciated that all of the tests specified above have a certain<br>
amount of inherent test error. Accordingly, results reported herein are not to<br>
be taken as absolute numbers, but numerical ranges based upon the<br>
precision of the particular test.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as<br>
well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention.<br>
However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>

Examples 1-10<br>
The reaction components and diluent (D30) listed in Table 1 were<br>
mixed together with stirring or rolling for at least about 3 hours at 23°C, until<br>
all components were dissolved. The reactive components are reported as<br>
weight percent of all reactive components and the diluent is weight percent of<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was placed into thermoplastic contact<br>
lens molds (made from Topas® copolymers of ethylene and norbornene<br>
obtained from Ticona Polymers), and irradiated using Philips TL 20W/03T<br>
fluorescent bulbs at 45°C for about 20 minutes N2. The molds were opened<br>
and lenses were extracted into a 50:50 (wt) solution of IPA and H2O, and<br>
soaked in IPA at ambient temperature for about 15 hours to remove residual<br>
diluent and monomers, placed into deionized H2O for about 30 minutes, then<br>
equilibrated in borate buffered saline for at least about 24 hours and<br>
autoclaved at 122°C for 30 minutes. The properties of the resulting lenses<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
1. Equilibrium water content<br>
2. Dynamic contact angle, measured with physiological borate-buffered saline<br>
using a Wilhelmy balance.<br>
3. Oxygen permeability, edge corrected, in Baiters.<br>
The results of Examples 1-10 show that the reaction mixture<br>
components and their amounts may be varied substantially, while still<br>
providing uncoated lenses having an excellent balance of mechanical<br>
properties and wettability. The contact angle (DCA) of Example 9 may be too<br>
high to form a lens that would be clinically wettable, and the modulus may be<br>
lower than desired to provide a mechanically robust lens. Example 9<br>
contained the lowest concentration of SiGMA (20%). Because the SiGMA<br>
had been reduced, less PVP could be added to the formulation and still<br>
provide a compatible reaction mixture. Thus, these examples show that<br>
SiGMA is effective in compatibilizing PVP and that when sufficient SiGMA and<br>
PVP are present lenses with desirable wettability and other mechanical<br>
properties can be made without any form of surface modification.<br>
Example 11<br>
Lenses having the formulation of Example 1 were remade, without<br>
controlling cure intensity. The mechanical properties are reported in Table 2,<br>
below. These lenses were clinically evaluated using ACUVUE® 2 lenses as<br>
controls. The test lenses were worn in one eye and an ACUVUE®2 lens was<br>
worn on the contralateral eye. The lenses were worn by 6 patients in a daily<br>
wear mode (nightly removal) for a period of one week. At one week the<br>
PLTF-NIBUT was 3.6 (±3.0) seconds compared to 5.8 (±2.5) seconds for<br>
ACUVUE® 2 lenses. The front surface deposition was graded none to slight<br>
for 50% of the test lenses and 100% for the control lenses. The movement<br>
was acceptable for both test and control lenses.<br>
Example 12<br>
Example 11 was repeated except that the cure intensity was reduced<br>
to 1.0 mW/cm2. The mechanical properties are reported in Table 2, below.<br>
These lenses were clinically evaluated using ACUVUE® 2 lenses as controls.<br>
The test lenses were worn by 15 patients in a daily wear mode (nightly<br>
removal), in one eye for a period of one week and an ACUVUE® 2 lens was<br>
worn in the contralateral eye. At one week the PLTF-NIBUT was 8.2 (±1.7)<br>
seconds compared to 6.9 (±1.5) seconds for ACUVUE® 2 lenses. The front<br>
surface deposition was graded none to slight for all of the patients for both<br>
test and control lenses. The movement was acceptable for both test and<br>
control lenses.<br><br>
Generally the mechanical properties for Examples 1,11 and 12 are<br>
consistent results for multiple runs of the same material. However, the clinical<br>
results for Examples 11 (uncontrolled cure intensity) and 12 (low, controlled<br>
cure intensity) are substantially different. The on eye wettability after one<br>
week of wear for Example 11 (measured by PLTF-NIBUT) was worse that the<br>
ACUVUE® 2 lenses (3.6 v. 5.8) and half the lenses had more than slight<br>
surface depositions. The Example 12 lenses (controlled, low intensity cure)<br>
displayed significantly improved on-eye wettability, which was measurably<br>
better than ACUVUE® 2 lenses (8.2 v. 6.9) and no surface depositions. Thus,<br>
using a low, controlled cure provides an uncoated lens having on-eye<br>
wettability which is as good as, and in some cases better than conventional<br>
hydrogel lenses.<br>
Examples 13-17<br>
Reaction mixtures described in Table 3 and containing low or no<br>
compatibilizing component (in these Examples SiGMA) were mixed with<br>
constant stirring at room temperature for 16 hours. Even after 16 hours each<br>
of the reaction mixtures remained cloudy and some contained precipitates.<br>
Accordingly, these reaction mixtures could not be used to produce lenses.<br><br><br>
Examples 13 through 15 show that reaction mixtures without any<br>
compatibilizing component (SiGMA or mPDMS-OH) are incompatible, and not<br>
suitable for making contact lenses. Examples 16 and 17 show that<br>
concentrations of compatibilizing component less than about 20 weight% are<br>
insufficient to compatibilize significant amounts of high molecular weight<br>
PVP. However, comparing Example 17 to Example 9, lesser amounts of high<br>
molecular weight PVP (3 weight %) can be included and still form a<br>
compatible reaction mixture.<br>
Examples 18-26<br>
A solution of 1.00 gram of D30,1.00 gram of mPDMS and 1.00 gram<br>
of TRIS was placed in a glass vial (Ex. 18). As the blend was rapidly stirred at<br>
about 20 to 23 °C with a magnetic stir bar, a solution of 12 parts (wt) PVP<br>
(K90) and 60 parts DMA was added dropwise until the solution remained<br>
cloudy after 3 minutes of stirring. The mass of the added DMA/PVP blend<br>
was determined in grams and reported as the "monomer compatibility index".<br>
This test was repeated using SiGMA (Ex. 19), MBM (Ex. 20), MPD (Ex. 21),<br>
acPDMS, where n=10 (Ex. 22), acPDMS where n=20 (Ex. 23), iSiGMA-3Me<br>
(Ex. 24) and TRIS2-HOEOP2 (Ex. 25) as test silicone monomers in place of<br>
TRIS.<br><br><br>
Doug - should we try mPDMS-OH and see what that number is?<br>
Structures for acPDMS, iSiGMA-3Me and TRIS2-HOEOP2 are shown<br>
below.<br>
acPDMS (n averages 10 or 20):<br><br>
TRIS2-HOEOP2<br><br>
iSiMAA3-Me<br><br>
The results, shown in Table 4, show that SiGMA, acPDMS (where n= 10 and<br>
20) and mPDMS-OH more readily incorporate into a blend of a diluent,<br>
another silicone containing monomer, a hydrophilic monomer, and an high<br>
molecular weight polymer (PVP) than alternative silicone-containing<br>
monomers. Thus, compatibilizing silicone containing monomers having a<br>
compatibility index of greater than about 0.5 are useful for compatibilizing high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymers like PVP.<br>
Example 27 -35<br>
Lenses were made using the reaction mixture formulation of Example<br>
1. The plastic contact lens molds (made from Topas® copolymers of ethylene<br>
and norbornene obtained from Ticona Polymers) were stored overnight in<br>
nitrogen (
mixture. Molds were closed and lenses photocured using the times and cure<br>
intensities indicated in Table 5. Lenses were formed by irradiation of the<br>
monomer mix using visible light fluorescent bulbs, curing at 45°C. The<br>
intensity was varied by using a variable balast or light filters, in two steps of<br>
varied intensity and cure time. The step 2 time was selected to provide the<br>
same total irradiation energy (about 830 mJ/cm2) for each sample.<br>
The finished lenses were demolded use a 60:40 mixture of isopropyl<br>
alcohol/DI water. The lenses were transferred to a jar containing 300 g 100%<br>
isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The IPA was replaced every 2 hours for 10 hours. At<br>
the end of about 10 hours, 50% of the IPA was removed and replaced with Dl<br>
water and the jar was rolled for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, 50% of the IPA<br>
was removed and replaced with Dl water and the jar was rolled for another 20<br>
minutes. The lenses were transferred to packing solution, rolled for 20<br>
minutes and then tested.<br><br>
The contact angles for Examples 27 through 232 are not significantly<br>
different, indicating that step 1 cure intensities of less than about about 2<br>
mW/cm2 provide improved wettability for this lens formulation regardless of<br>
the step 1 cure time. However, those of skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
shorter step 1 cure times (such as those used in Examples 28 and 31) allow<br>
for shorter overall cure cycles. Moreover, it should be noted that even though<br>
the contact angles for Examples 33 through 35 are measurably higher than<br>
those of Examples 27-32, the lenses of Examples 33-35 may still provide<br>
desirable on eye wettability.<br>
Examples 36 - 41<br>
The reaction components of Example 1, were blended with either 25%<br>
or 40% D3O as diluent in accordance with the procedure of Example 1. The<br>
resultant reaction mixtures were charged into plastic contact lens molds<br>
(made from Topas® copolymers of ethylene and norbornene obtained from<br>
Ticona Polymers) and cured in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere, at<br>
about 2.5 mW/cm2 intensity, about 30 minutes and the temperatures shown in<br>
Table 6, below. The lenses were removed from the molds, hydrated and<br>
autoclaved as describe in Example 1. After hydration the haze values of the<br>
lenses were determined. The results shown in Table 6 show that the degree<br>
of haziness was reduced at the higher temperatures. The results also show<br>
that as the concentration of diluent decreases the haze also decreases.<br><br>
The results in Table 6 show that haze may be reduced by about 20%<br>
(Example 41 v. Example 39) and up to as much as about 65% (Example 37 v.<br>
Example 36) by increasing the cure temperature. Decreasing diluent<br>
concentration from 40 to 25% decrease haze by between about 40 and 75%.<br>
Examples 42-47<br>
Lenses were made from the formulations shown in Table 8 using the<br>
procedure of Example 1, with a 30 minute cure time at 25°C and an intensity<br>
of about 2.5 mW/cm2. Percent haze was measured and is reported in Table<br>
7.<br><br>
A comparision of the results for formulations having the same amount<br>
of diluent and either TEGDMA or acPDMS (Examples 42 and 46 and<br>
Examples 43 and 47) shows that acPDMS is an effective crosslinker and<br>
provides lenses with properties which are comparable to those where<br>
TEGDMA is used as a crosslinker. Examples 44 and 45 contain both<br>
crosslinkers. Haze for these Examples decreased substantially compared to<br>
the lenses made from either crosslinker alone. However, modulus and<br>
elongation were negatively impacted (likely because the amount of crosslinker<br>
was too great).<br>
Examples 48-52<br>
Reaction mixtures were made using the formulations shown in Table 8<br>
with a mixture of 72.5% t-amyl alcohol and 27.5% PVP (Mw = 2500) as the<br>
diluent. The reaction mixtures were placed into thermoplastic contact lens<br>
molds, and irradiated using Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs at45°C, 0.8<br>
mW/cm2 for about 32 minutes. The molds were opened and lenses were<br>
released into deionized water at 95°C over a period of 20 minutes. The<br>
lenses were then placed into borate buffered saline solution for 60 minutes<br>
and autoclaved at 122°C and 30 minutes. The properties of the resulting<br>
lenses are shown in Table 9.<br><br>
Diluents (weight parts):<br>
A = 72.5% t-amyl alcohol and 27.5 PVP (Mw = 2500)<br>
B = t-amyl alcohol<br>
C = 15/38/38% TMP/2M2P/ PVP (Mw = 2500)<br>
D= 57/43 2M2P/TMP<br>
NT - not tested<br>
Thus, Examples 48, 51 show that formulations comprising both<br>
hydrophilic (EGDMA or TEGDMA) and hydrophobic crosslinkers (acPDMS)<br>
provide silicone hydrogel compositions which display an excellent balance of<br>
properties including good water content, moderate Dk, wettabiltiy, modulus<br>
and elongation.<br>
Example 55<br>
The lenses of Example 48 were clinically evaluated. The lenses were<br>
worn by 18 patients in a daily wear mode (nightly removal) for a period of one<br>
week. At one week the PLTF-NIBUT was 8.4 (±2.9) seconds compared to 7.0<br>
(±1.3) seconds for ACUVUE® 2 lenses. The front surface discrete deposition<br>
was graded none to slight for 97% of the patients with the test lenses,<br>
compared with 89% in control lenses. The movement was acceptable for<br>
both test and control lenses.<br>
Example 56<br>
The lenses of Example 49 were clinically evaluated. The lenses were<br>
worn by 18 patients in a daily wear mode (nightly removal) for a period of one<br>
week. At one week the PLTF-NIBUT was 8.4 (±2.9) seconds compared to 7<br>
(±1.3) seconds for ACUVUE® 2 lenses. The front surface discrete deposition<br>
was graded none to slight for 95% of the patients with the test lenses,<br>
compared with 89% in control lenses. The movement was acceptable for<br>
both test and control lenses.<br>
Example 57<br>
The lenses of Example 51 were clinically evaluated. The lenses were<br>
worn by 13 patients in a daily wear mode (nightly removal) for a period of one<br>
week. At one week the PLTF-NIBUT was 4.3 (±1.9) seconds compared to 9.6<br>
(±2.1) seconds for ACUVUE® 2 lenses. The front surface discrete deposition<br>
was graded none to slight for 70% of the patients with the test lenses,<br>
compared with 92% in control lenses. The movement was acceptable for<br>
both test and control lenses. Thus, there is some correlation between contact<br>
angle measurements (108° for Example 51 versus 52° for Example 48) and<br>
clinical wettability as measure by PLTF-NIBUT (4.3 seconds for Example 51<br>
versus 8.4 seconds for Example 48).<br>
Examples 58-68<br>
Silicone hydrogel lenses were made using the components listed in<br>
Table 9 and the following procedure:<br>
The components were mixed together in a jar to for a reaction mixture.<br>
The jar containing the reaction mixture was placed on a jar mill roller and<br>
rolled overnight.<br>
The reaction mixture was placed in a vacuum desiccator and the<br>
oxygen removed by applying vacuum for 40 minutes. The desiccator was<br>
back filled with nitrogen. Contact lenses were formed by adding<br>
approximately 0.10 g of the degassed lens material to the concave front curve<br>
side of TOPAS® mold cavities in a glove box with nitrogen purge. The molds<br>
were closed with polypropylene convex base curve mold halves.<br>
Polymerization was carried out under a nitrogen purge and was photoinitiated<br>
with 5 mW cm2 of visible light generated using 20W fluorescent lights with a<br>
TL-03 phosphor. After curing for 25 minutes at 45°C, the molds were opened.<br>
The concave front curve portion of the lens mold was placed into a sonication<br>
bath (Aquasonic model 75D) containing deionized water under the conditions<br>
(temperature and amount of Tween) shown in Table 10. The lens deblock<br>
time is shown in Table 10. The lenses were clear and of the proper shape to<br>
be contact lenses.<br><br><br>
Example 69<br>
The lenses of Example 59 which were deblocked in Example 66, were<br>
further hydrated in deionized water at 65°C for 20 minutes. The lenses were<br>
then transferred into borate buffered saline solution and allowed to equilibrate<br>
for at least about 24 hours. The lenses were clear and of the proper shape to<br>
be contact lenses. The lenses had a water content of 43%, a modulus of 87<br>
psi, an elongation of 175%, and a Dk of 61 barriers. The lenses were found to<br>
have an advancing contact angle of 57 degrees. This indicates the lenses<br>
were substantially free of hydrophobic material.<br>
Example 70<br>
The concave front curve portion of the lens mold from Example 61 was<br>
placed into a sonication bath (Aquasonic model 75D) containing about 5%<br>
DOE-120 in deionized water at about 75°C. The lenses deblocked from the<br>
frame in 18 minutes.<br>
Example 71 (use of an organic solvent)<br>
The concave front curve portion of the lens mold from example 61 was<br>
placed into a sonication bath (Aquasonic 75D) containing about 10% of 2-<br>
propanol an organic solvent in deionized water at 75°C. The lenses<br>
deblocked form the frame in 15 minutes. When Tween was used as the<br>
additive (Example 68) the deblock time was 18 minutes. Thus, the present<br>
example shows that organic solvents may also be used to deblock lenses<br>
comprising low molecular weight hydrophilic polymers.<br>
EXAMPLE 72 (contains no low molecular weight PVP)<br>
Silicone hydrogel lenses wee made using the formulation and<br>
procedure of Example 58, but without any low molecular weight PVP. The<br>
following procedure was used to deblock the lenses.<br>
The concave front curve portion of the lens mold was placed into a<br>
sonication bath (Aquasonic model 75D) containing about 850ppm of Tween in<br>
deionized water at about 65°C. The lenses did not release from the mold.<br>
The deblock time for the formulation which contained low molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer (Example 58 formuation) under similar deblock conditions<br>
(Example 62 - 850 ppm Tween and 75°C) was 10 minutes. Thus, the present<br>
Example shows that deblocking cannot be accomplished in water only, in this<br>
formulation without including low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer in the<br>
formulation.<br>
Example 73<br>
The concave front curve portion of the lens mold from example 72 was<br>
placed into a sonication bath (Aquasonic 75D) containing about 10% of 2-<br>
propanol an organic solvent in deionized water at 75°C. The lenses<br>
deblocked form the frame in 20 to 25 minutes. Thus, lenses of the present<br>
invention which do not contain low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer may<br>
be deblocked using an aqueous solution comprising an organic solvent.<br>
Examples 74-76<br>
Formulations were made according to Example 49, but with varying<br>
amounts of photoinitiator (0.23,0.38 or 0.5 wt.%), curing at 45°C with Philips<br>
TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs (which closely match the spectral output of the<br>
visible light used to measure gel time) irradiating the molds at 2.0 mW/cm2.<br>
The advancing contact angles of the resulting lenses are shown in Table 11.<br><br><br>
Examples 77-79<br>
Gel times were measured for the formulation of Example 1 at 45°C at<br>
1.0,2.5 and 5.0 mW/cm2. The results are shown in Table 12.<br><br>
The results of Examples 74 through 76 and 77 through 79 compared<br>
with Examples 27-35, show that as gel times increase, wettability improves.<br>
Thus, gel points can be used, in coordination with contact angle<br>
measurements, to determine suitable cure conditions for a given polymer<br>
formulation and photoinitiator system.<br>
Example 80 (Macromer Preparation)<br>
To a dry container, which was housed in a dry box under nitrogen at<br>
ambient temperature was added 30.0 g (0.277 mol) of<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane (a water scavenger), a solution of 13.75 ml of<br>
a 1M solution of TBACB (386.0 g TBACB in 1000 ml dry THF), 61.39 g (0.578<br>
mol) of p-xylene, 154.28 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate (1.4 equivalents<br>
relative to initiator), 1892.13 (9.352 mol) 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate<br>
(8.5 equivalents relative to initiator) and 4399.78 g (61.01 mol) of THF. This<br>
mixture was charged to a dry, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped<br>
with a thermocouple and condenser, all connected to a nitrogen source.<br>
The initial mixture was cooled to 15 °C while stirring and purging with<br>
nitrogen. After the solution reached 15°C, 191.75 g (1.100 mol) of 1-<br>
trimethylsiloxy-1-methoxy-2-methylpropene (1 equivalent) was injected into<br>
the reaction vessel. The reaction was allowed to exotherm to approximately<br>
62 °C and then 30 ml of a 0.40 M solution of 154.4 g TBACB in 11 ml of dry<br>
THF was metered in throughout the remainder of the reaction. After the<br>
temperature of reaction reached 30 °C and the metering began, a solution of<br>
467.56 g (2.311 mol) 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (2.1 equivalents<br>
relative to the initiator), 3636.6. g (3.463 mol) n-butyl<br>
monomethacryloxypropyl-polydimethylsiloxane (3.2 equivalents relative to the<br>
initiator), 3673.84 g (8.689 mol) TRIS (7.9 equivalents relative to the initiator)<br>
and 20.0 g bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane was added.<br>
This mixture was allowed to exotherm to approximately 38-42 °C and<br>
then allowed to cool to 30 °C. At that time, a solution of 10.0 g (0.076 mol)<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 154.26 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate<br>
(1.4 equivalents relative to the initiator) and 1892.13 g (9.352 mol) 2-<br>
trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to the initiator) was<br>
added and the mixture again allowed to exotherm to approximately 40 °C.<br>
The reaction temperature dropped to approximately 30 °C and 2 gallons of<br>
THF were added to decrease the viscosity. A solution of 439.69 g water,<br>
740.6 g methanol and 8.8 g (0.068 mol) dichloroacetic acid was added and<br>
the mixture refluxed for 4.5 hours to remove the trimethylsiloxy protecting<br>
groups on the HEMA. Volatiles were then removed and toluene added to aid<br>
in removal of the water until a vapor temperature of 110 °C was reached.<br>
The reaction flask was maintained at approximately 110 °C and a<br>
solution of 443 g (2.201 mol) TMI and 5.7 g (0.010 mol) dibutyltin dilaurate<br>
were added. The mixture was reacted until the isocyanate peak was gone by<br>
IR. The toluene was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield an off-white,<br>
anhydrous, waxy reactive macromer. The macromer was placed into acetone<br>
at a weight basis of approximately 2:1 acetone to macromer. After 24 hrs,<br>
water was added to precipitate out the macromer and the macromer was<br>
filtered and dried using a vacuum oven between 45 and 60 °C for 20-30 hrs.<br>
Examples 81-881<br>
Reaction mixtures were made in a nitrogen-filled glove box using the<br>
formulations shown in Table 12 with a D3O and/or IPL as the diluent. The<br>
reaction mixtures were placed into thermoplastic contact lens molds, and<br>
irradiated using Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs at 50°C, for about 60<br>
minutes. The molds were opened and lenses were released IPA, leached<br>
and transferred into borate buffered saline. The properties of the resulting<br>
lenses are shown in Table 13.<br><br>
Example 89<br>
The lenses of Example 83 were clinically evaluated. The lenses were<br>
worn by 10 patients in a daily wear mode (nightly removal) for a period of 30<br>
minutes. For each patient, the test lens was worn in one eye and an Bauch &amp;<br>
Lomb Purevision lens was worn in the contralateral eye. At thirty minutes the<br>
PLTF-NIBUT was 7.5 (±1.6) seconds compared to 8.6 (+1.6) seconds for the<br>
Bausch &amp; Lomb Purevision lens. . The front surface discrete deposition was<br>
graded none to slight for 100% of the patients with the test lenses, compared<br>
with 100% in control lenses. The movement was acceptable for both test and<br>
control lenses. The lenses of the present invention are comparable in<br>
performance to the B&amp;L lens, which has a plasma coating. Thus, the present<br>
Example shows that lenses formed from a polymer network comprising a<br>
siloxane containing macromer, high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer and<br>
a compatibilizing component display good wettability and deposition<br>
resistance without a coating.<br>
Example 90<br>
Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (2.3 ml) was added to 27.8 g 1,3-<br>
bis(hydroxybutyl)tetramethyldisiloxane and 204.4 g<br>
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. The resulting solution was stirred overnight.<br>
17.0 g Na2CO3 were added and the mixture was stirred for one hour. About<br>
50 ml hexane was added and the mixture was stirred for about one hour, then<br>
filtered. The hexane was evaporated under reduced pressure and cyclics<br>
were removed by heating to 110°C at 
hydroxybutyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
In a separate flask 12.2 g CH2OH terminated Fluorolink® Polymer<br>
Modifier D10 with an average equivalent weight of 500 (Ausimont USA,<br>
equivalent to Fomblin® ZDOL) was combined with 11.8 mg dibutyltin<br>
dilaurate. The resulting solution was evacuated to about 20 mBar twice, each<br>
time refilling with dry N2. 5.0 ml isophorone diisocyanate was added and the<br>
mixture was stirred overnight under N2 to produce a clear viscous product.<br>
47.7 g of the hydroxybutyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane from above<br>
was combined with 41.3 grams anhydrous toluene. This solution was<br>
combined with the Fluorolink®-lsophorone diisocyanate product and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen overnight. The toluene was<br>
evaporated from the product over about 5 hours at 
isocyanatoethyl methacrylate was added and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
under N2 for four days to produce a slightly opaque viscous liquid<br>
fluorosilicone macromer.<br>
Example 91<br>
2.60 g of the fluorosilicone macromer made in Example 90 was<br>
combined with 1.12 g ethanol, 1.04 g TRIS, 1.56 g DMA, 32 mg Darocur 1173<br>
to produce a slightly hazy blend containing 18% diluent (ethanol). Contact<br>
lenses were made from this blend in plastic molds (Topas) curing 30 minutes<br>
under fluorescent UV lamps at room temperature in a N2 atmosphere. The<br>
molds were opened, and the lenses released (deblocked) into ethanol. The<br>
lenses were leached with CH2CI2 and then IPA for about 30 minutes each at<br>
room temperature, then placed into borate buffered saline for about 2 hours<br>
and then autoclave at 121°C for 30 minutes. The resulting lenses were tacky<br>
to the touch and had a tendency to stick to each other. The advancing DCA<br>
of these lenses was measured and is shown in Table 14.<br>
Example 92-88<br>
Reaction mixtures were made using the reactive components (amounts<br>
based upon reactive components) shown in Table 14 and D30 as a diluent.<br>
The amount of D3O is based upon the total amount of reactive components<br>
and diluent. The reaction mixture and lenses were made using procedure of<br>
Example 91. The resulting lenses were slippery to the touch and did not stick<br>
to each other.<br>
The advancing DCA of these lenses was measured and is shown in<br>
Table 14, below.<br>
Examples 92 through 94 clearly show that hydrophilic polymer may be<br>
used to improve wettability. In these Examples contact angles are reduced by<br>
up to about 50% (Example 93) and up to about 60% (Example 94).<br>
Compositons comprising higher amounts of fluorosilicone macromer and<br>
hydrophilic polymer can also be made by functionalizing the fluorosilicone<br>
macromer to include active hydrogens.<br>
Examples 95-95<br>
Reaction mixtures were made using reactive components shown in<br>
Table 15 and 29% (based upon all reactive components and diluent) t-amyl<br>
alcohol as a diluent and 11% PVP 2,500 (based upon reactive components).<br>
Amounts indicated are based upon 100% reactive components. The reaction<br>
mixtures were placed into thermoplastic contact lens molds, and irradiated<br>
using Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulb at 60°C, 0.8 mW/cm2 for about 30<br>
minutes under nitrogen. The molds were opened and lenses were released<br>
into deionized water at 95°C over a period of 15 minutes. The lenses were<br>
then placed into borate buffered saline solution for 60 minutes and autoclaved<br>
at 122° C for 30 min. The properties of the resulting lenses are shown in<br>
Table 15.<br>
Table 15 shows that the addition of PVP dramatically decreases<br>
contact angle. As little as 1% decreases the dynamic contact angle by about<br>
10% and as little as 3% decreases dynamic contact angle by about 50%.<br>
These improvements are consistent with those observed for macromer based<br>
polymers, such as those in Examples 92-94.<br>
Example 100<br>
Preparation of mPDMS-OH (used in Examples 3)<br>
96 g of Gelest MCR-E11 (mono-(2,3-epoxypropyl)-propyl ether<br>
terminated polydimethylsiloxane(1000 MW)), 11.6 g methacrylic acid, 0.10 g<br>
triethylamine and 0.02 g hydroquinone monomethylether were combined and<br>
heated to 140°C with an air bubbler and with stirring for 2.5 hours. The<br>
product was extracted with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and CH2CI2. The<br>
CH2CI2 layer was dried over Na2 SO4 and evaporated to give 94 g of product.<br>
HPLC/MS was consistent with desired structure:<br>
