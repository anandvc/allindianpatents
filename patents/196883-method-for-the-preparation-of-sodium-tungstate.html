				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of sodium tungstate by the oxidation of hard metal scrap and/or heavy metal scrap in a molten salt.       <br>
Methods for the working up of hard metal scrap (WC-Co or WC-Co-TaC-TiC) and heavy metal scrap (W-Cu-Ni-Fe) are described in numerous patent publications. Known methods include the oxidation of hard metal scrap at elevated temperatures (US-A 3 887.680), treatment with liquid zinc (US-A 3 595 484) or the anodic dissolving of the binder (AT-A 380 495). These methods are either expensive as regards apparatus or are suitable only for certain types of scrap.<br>
Moreover the reaction of hard metal scrap in molten salts is important industrially.<br>
Thus US-A 4 603 043 describes the working up of W-containing materials in a molten salt consisting of NaN03 and NaOH at temperatures of 500 to 700oC Here,   in   order  better  to   control   the  reaction,   NaOH   and  the   W-containing component are first of all  heated to  560 to  600oC.  The NaN03  required  as oxidising agent is subsequently added over a period of 2 to 3 hours.<br>
According to DE-A 314 495, the working up of hard metal scrap is likewise; carried out in an alkali hydroxide/alkali nitrate melt, in a molten salt consisting of; 40 to 80% alkali nitrate and 20 to 60% alkali hydroxide. 5% of NaCl is added in , order to lower the melting point. The melting temperature is 550°C. The melt is subsequently poured into water.<br>
DD-A 207 932 discloses the working up of hard metal scrap in pure sodium nitrate melts or pure sodium nitrite melts. Here the stoichiometric excess of the alkali component is to be 10 to 15% and the melting temperature 900°C. The reacted melt is cooled to room temperature prior to being dissolved in water.<br>
According to IN-A. 157 146, a molten salt consisting of alkali hydroxide, preferably KOH or NaOH, and an alkali nitrate as oxidising agent, preferably KN03 or NaN03, is employed for the working up of hard metal scrap. The melting temperature varies between 350 and 460°C. In this connection it was established that at 400 to 420°C the yields of tungsten are 90 to 94%. At 440 to<br>
460°C the yield of tungsten can be increased to 99%. In this case the reaction can be controlled only with difficulty. In addition emission of nitrogen oxides occurs.<br>
The disadvantage of all reactions in nitrate and/or nitrite media is that the highly exothermic reaction is difficult to control. Consequently the overall reaction is considered to be problematic as regards industrial safety. In addition there is a frequently uncontrollable emission of nitrous gases. Nitrite and nitrate contained in the sodium tungstate solution and in the filtration residues render working up extremely difficult when a solvent extraction has subsequently to be carried out.<br>
The object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a method for the working up of lumps of hard metal scrap and heavy metal scrap, which does not have the disadvantages described.<br>
This object was fulfilled according to the invention by the working up by oxidation of tungsten-containing scrap of various compositions in a molten salt consisting of NaOH and Na2O4<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for the preparation of sodium tungstate by the oxidation of hard metal scrap and/or heavy metal scrap of the kind such as herein described in a molten salt, characterized in that a molten salt consisting of from 60 to 90 wt.% of NaOH and from 10 to 40 wt.% of Na2S04 is used.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a method for the preparation of sodium tungstate by the oxidation of hard metal scrap and/or heavy metal scrap in a molten salt, characterised in that a molten salt consisting of from 60 to 90 wt.% of NaOH and from 10 to 40 wt.% of Na2S04 is used.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a moving melt, particularly preferably in a • batchwise operated directly fired rotary kiln. As protection against stresses the rotary kiln should be lined with a refractory material. The oxidation is advantageously carried out by blowing air into the melt. It is technically efficient to carry out the reaction at temperatures of between 800 and 1100°C. Particularly good digestion data are obtained when the reaction is carried out using a 5 to 20 wt.% excess of alkali components.<br>
The  method  according to the invention  is  further  explained  below,  with  no limitation to the invention being thereby intended<br>
After the liquefaction of the melt, the energy supply is stopped and the reaction is conducted for 4 to 8 hours, with blowing in of air and rotation of the kiln. In the<br>
-/-<br>
course of this the tungsten content passes from the W-containing materials directly into the sodium tungstate.<br>
An additional energy supply is unnecessary; the reaction can be controlled solely by the volume of air blown in. After termination of the reaction, the Na2WO4 melt is transferred directly into water through special hoppers. Sodium tungstate dissolves instantly and can be worked up into tungsten carbide powder by the conventional methods.<br>
The rest of the components present in the feed material such as Co, TiC, TaC or Fe, Ni, Cu remain in the residue and can likewise be worked up by known methods.<br>
An advantage of the method according to the invention is that the reaction is mildly exothermic in an NaOH/Na2S04 melt. The overall reaction can be efficiently controlled by the blowing in of air, that is, there are no problems as regards industrial safety.<br>
Another advantage is that the alkali compounds used have no adverse effects at all on the further processing of the useful components.<br>
Furthermore, no uncontrollable emission of reaction gases occurs in the course of this reaction.<br>
The method according to the invention is explained below by means of examples, without any limitation being intended.<br>
Example 1<br>
1000 kg of lumps of hard metal scrap having the composition 84% WC, 9% Co, 4% TaC, 3% TiC together with 400 kg of NaOH and 150 kg of Na2S04 were charged into a batchwise operated rotary kiln lined with a refractory material and heated to about 900°C. Following termination of the reaction after 6 hours, the melt was transferred into about 5 m3 of water and leached. After filtration, the Co, Ti and Ta constituents remained in the residue, whereas the tungsten passed into the filtrate as sodium tungstate and was worked up by means of conventional methods into ammonium paratungstate.<br>
■/-<br>
The yield of W from digestion was 86.3%.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure was as described in Example 1.<br>
In addition, during the six-hour reaction in solution 60 m3 air/hour was blown through the melt. The working up was carried out as described in Example 1.<br>
The yield from digestion was 89.5%.<br>
Example 3<br>
1000 kg of lumps of hard metal scrap together with 400 kg of NaOH and 250 kg of Na2S04 were melted and worked up as described in Example 1.<br>
The yield of W from digestion was 91.5%.<br>
Example 4<br>
1000 kg of lumps of hard metal scrap together with 400 kg of NaOH and 150 kg of Na2S04 were digested and processed as in Example 1, but without moving the melt.<br>
The yield of W from digestion was 75.1%.<br>
The melt variables chosen in the Example and the yields from digestion as a function of the Na2C4 content are shown in Figure 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
