SPECIFICATION<br>
METAL GASKET FOR CYLINDER HEAD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a metal gasket for cylinder head,<br>
which is placed between a cylinder block of an internal combustion engine,<br>
and a cylinder head thereof.<br>
5	Background Art<br>
[0002]	As this type of metal gasket, a metal gasket shown, for example, in<br>
Fig. 3 in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-287137, is known.<br>
This metal gasket for cylinder head includes: two base plates which are metal<br>
plates, and in each of which cylinder holes are formed corresponding to<br>
10	individual cylinder bores in a cylinder block of an internal combustion engine;<br>
circumferential beads having a both-sided sloped angular shape in cross<br>
section and formed around the individual cylinder holes; cooling water holes<br>
formed outside the peripheries of the individual circumferential beads corre-<br>
sponding to a cooling water jacket of the cylinder block and cooling water<br>
15	holes of the cylinder head; and an outer bead having a one-sided sloped shape<br>
in cross section and formed and positioned so as to enclose the circumferential<br>
beads and the cooling water holes as a whole. Further, a thin step adjustment<br>
plate made of a metal plate is placed between the two base plates.<br>
[0003]	The step adjustment plate extends outward, from the position inside<br>
20	the circumferential beads of the base plate to the position of the cooling water<br>
jacket, and has claw-like protrusions. When the claw-like protrusions are<br>
inserted into the cooling water holes of one of the base plates, and the<br>
portions protruding from the cooling water holes are folded over, the step<br>
adjustment plate is coupled with the base plate, so that the contact pressure<br>
25	exerted on the circumferential beads of the base plate, and the sealing of the<br>
combustion gas in the cylinder bores are improved.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
[0004]	However, according to the conventional metal gasket described<br>
30	above, the step differences between the circumferential beads and the outer<br>
	05915(1/27)<br><br>
-2-<br>
bead of the base plate as well as the contact pressure applied to the<br>
circumferential beads, can be adjusted only by employing the thickness of the<br>
step adjustment plate that extends outward from the position inside the<br>
circumferential beads of the base plate to the position of the cooling water<br>
5	jacket. Therefore, there has been a problem that the lower limit for the<br>
adjustment is limited to the lower limit of a thickness available for a metal<br>
plate for the step adjustment plate and fine adjustments for the step<br>
differences can not be performed to obtain an appropriate contact pressure to<br>
be applied to the circumferential beads and the outer bead.<br>
10	Means for solving the problems<br>
[0005]	The objective of the present invention is to advantageously solve<br>
the above-described problems. According to the present invention, a metal<br>

water holes formed outside peripheries of the circumferential beads<br>
20	corresponding to a cooling water jacket for the cylinder block and cooling<br>
water holes in the cylinder head, and an outer bead which has a one-sided<br>
sloped shape in cross section and is formed and positioned so as to entirely<br>
enclose the circumferential beads and the cooling water holes, and wherein the<br>
circumferential beads of the two base plates are aligned in the direction of<br>
25	thickness of the metal gasket, is characterized in that, claw-like protrusions<br>
which are provided with one of inner step adjustment plate and outer step<br>
adjustment plate, are inserted into engagement holes in the other of the inner<br>
step adjustment plate and the outer step adjustment plate, the outer step<br>
adjustment plate being formed of a metal plate and extending from the<br>
30	position of the cooling water jacket to the positions of the outer edges of the<br>
base plates, while the inner step adjustment plate being formed of a metal<br>
plate having a thicker thickness than the outer step adjustment plate and<br>
extending from locations inside the circumferential beads of the base plates to<br>
	05915(2/27)<br><br>
-3-<br>
the position of the cooling water jacket, and portions projecting through the<br>
engagement holes are folded over so as to couple the outer and the inner step<br>
adjustment plates, thus, placing the outer and inner step adjustment plates<br>
between the two base plates<br>
5	[0006]	Furthermore, according to the present invention, a metal gasket for<br>
cylinder head of a two-plate lamination type, wherein a base plate is provided,<br>
which is a metal plate, the base plate having cylinder holes formed<br>
corresponding to cylinder bores in a cylinder block on which a cylinder head<br>
for an internal combustion engine is mounted, circumferential beads which<br>
10	have a both-sided sloped angular shape in cross section and are formed around<br>
the peripheries of the cylinder holes, cooling water holes formed outside<br>
peripheries of the circumferential beads corresponding to a cooling water<br>
jacket for the cylinder block and cooling water holes in the cylinder head, and<br>
an outer bead which has a one-sided sloped shape in cross section and is<br>
15	formed and positioned so as to entirely enclose the circumferential beads and<br>
the cooling water holes, is characterized in that, claw-like protrusions which<br>
are provided with one of inner step adjustment plate and outer step adjustment<br>
plate, are inserted into engagement holes in the other of the inner step<br>
adjustment plate and the outer step adjustment plate, the outer step adjustment<br>
20	plate being formed of a metal plate and extending from the position of the<br>
cooling water jacket to the positions of the outer edges of the base plates,<br>
while the inner step adjustment plate being formed of a metal plate having a<br>
thicker thickness than the outer step adjustment plate and extending from<br>
locations inside the circumferential beads of the base plates to the position of<br>
25	the cooling water jacket, and portions projecting through the engagement<br>
holes are folded over so as to couple the outer and the inner step adjustment<br>
plates, thus, overlapping the outer and inner step adjustment plates with the<br>
base plate.<br>
[0007]	Furthermore, according to the present invention, a metal gasket for<br>
30	cylinder head of a single-plate type, which is a metal plate, having cylinder<br>
holes formed corresponding to cylinder bores in a cylinder block on which a<br>
cylinder head for an internal combustion engine is mounted, circumferential<br>
beads which have a both-sided sloped angular shape in cross section and are<br>
	05915(3/27)<br><br>
-4-<br>
formed around the peripheries of the cylinder holes, cooling water holes<br>
which are formed outside the peripheries of the circumferential beads<br>
corresponding to a cooling water jacket for the cylinder block and cooling<br>
water holes in the cylinder head, and an outer bead which has a one-sided<br>
5	sloped shape in cross section and is formed and positioned so as to entirely<br>
enclose the circumferential beads and the cooling water holes, is characterized<br>
in that, claw-like protrusions which are provided with one of inner step<br>
adjustment plate and outer step adjustment plate, are inserted into engagement<br>
holes formed in the other of the inner step adjustment plate and the outer step<br>
10	adjustment plate, the outer step adjustment plate extending from the position<br>
of the cooling water jacket to the positions of the outer edges of the base<br>
plates, while the inner step adjustment plate being formed of a metal plate<br>
having a thicker thickness than the outer step adjustment plate and extending<br>
from locations inside the circumferential beads of the base plates to the<br>
15	position of the cooling water jacket, and portions projecting through the<br>
engagement holes are folded over so as to couple the outer base plate and the<br>
inner base plate.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0008]	According to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a three-plate<br>
20	lamination type of the present invention, an outer step adjustment plate and a<br>
thicker inner step adjustment plate, which are positioned between the two base<br>
plates, are coupled together and positioned by fitting claw-like protrusions<br>
into the engagement holes thereof. And by employing the difference in the<br>
thickness of the outer step adjustment plate and the inner step adjustment<br>
25	plate, the step between the circumferential beads and the outer beads of the<br>
base plate, and the contact pressure applied to the circumferential beads can<br>
be adjusted.<br>
[0009]	Therefore, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a<br>
three-plate lamination type of the present invention, the step difference can be<br>
30	adjusted by employing the difference in the plate thickness of the outer step<br>
adjustment plate and the inner adjustment plate, which is thicker than the<br>
former, and the lower limit for the step adjustment can be the lower limit of<br>
the difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate and the inner<br>
	05915(4/27)<br><br>
-5-<br>
step adjustment plate, which is thicker than the former. Thus, even a slight<br>
step difference can be designated in order to appropriately balance the contact<br>
pressure applied to the circumferential beads and the outer bead.<br>
[0010]	In the present invention, relative to the claw-like protrusions<br>
5	inserted into the engagement holes and folded over, claw-like protrusion-<br>
clearance holes may be formed in at least one of the two base plates to be<br>
aligned in the direction of thickness of the metal gasket. By employing the<br>
claw-like protrusion-clearance holes, a phenomenon can be prevented that, at<br>
positions outside the circumferential beads in the radial direction, the claw-<br>
10	like protrusions of either the outer step adjustment plate or the inner step<br>
adjustment plate, are folded over and overlap the other plate, and are held<br>
between the two base plates. Further, it is possible to prevent claw-like<br>
protrusions that function as shims from partially reducing the contact pressure<br>
applied to the circumferential beads.<br>
15	[0011]	When the metal gasket for cylinder head of the present invention is<br>
employed for a cylinder block of an open deck type, and the deck face is wide<br>
open at the location of a cooling water jacket, a base plate facing the cylinder<br>
block can be deformed and project into the cooling water jacket. Thus, since<br>
claw-like -protrusion clearance holes are not much required, clearance holes<br>
20	need be formed only in the base plate that faces the cylinder head. When the<br>
metal gasket for cylinder head of this invention is employed for a cylinder<br>
block of a closed deck type, for which the deck face is closed at the location<br>
of a cooling water jacket, except for cooling water holes, it is preferable that<br>
claw-like-protrusion clearance holes be formed in both a base plate facing the<br>
25	cylinder block and a base plate facing the cylinder head.<br>
[0012]	Furthermore, according to the present invention, relative to the<br>
claw-like protrusions that are inserted into the engagement holes and folded<br>
over, claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses facing the claw-like protrusions<br>
may be formed in at least one of the two base plates, in the direction of the<br>
30	thickness of the metal gasket. By employing the claw-like-protrusion<br>
clearance recesses, a phenomenon can also be prevented whereby, at positions<br>
outside the circumferential beads in the radial direction, the claw-like<br>
protrusions of either the outer step adjustment plate or the inner step<br>
	05915(5/27)<br><br>
-6-<br>
adjustment plate are folded over and overlap the other plate, and are held<br>
between the two base plates. Further, it is possible to prevent the claw-like<br>
protrusions that can function as shims from partially reducing the contact<br>
pressure applied to the circumferential beads. In addition, with these claw-<br>
5	like-protrusion clearance recesses, since the base plate is not open at the<br>
positions of the claw-like protrusions, the circulation of cooling water<br>
between the cylinder block and the cylinder head at unnecessary locations can<br>
be avoided.<br>
[0013]	In a case wherein the forming of the claw-like -protrusion<br>
10	clearance recesses is effected by press molding, generally, a raised portion is<br>
generated at a corresponding outside portion of the base plate. However,<br>
when the metal gasket for cylinder head of the present invention is employed<br>
for the above described open deck cylinder block, the raised portion need only<br>
be projected inside the cooling water jacket in order to form a claw-like -<br>
15	projection clearance recess in the base plate that faces the cylinder block. In<br>
a case wherein the metal gasket for cylinder head of this invention is<br>
employed for the above described closed deck cylinder block, the above<br>
described raised portion need only be projected inside the cooling water holes<br>
opening into the deck face of the cylinder block. And when the metal gasket<br>
20	for cylinder head is to be mounted on either type of cylinder block, the raised<br>
portion must be projected inside the cooling water holes opening in the deck<br>
face of the cylinder head in order to form a claw-like -projection clearance<br>
recess in the base plate that faces the cylinder head.<br>
[0014]	Further, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a two-<br>
25	plate lamination type of the present invention, an outer step adjustment plate<br>
and a thicker inner step adjustment plate, which are positioned with<br>
overlapping the two base plates, are coupled together and positioned by fitting<br>
claw-like protrusions into the engagement holes thereof. And by employing<br>
the difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate and the inner<br>
30	step adjustment plate, the step between the circumferential beads and the outer<br>
beads of the base plate, and the contact pressure applied to the circumferential<br>
beads can be adjusted.<br>
[0015]	Therefore, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a two-<br>
	05915(6/27)<br><br>
-7-<br>
plate lamination type of the present invention, the lower limit for the step<br>
adjustment can be the lower limit of the difference in the thickness of the<br>
outer step adjustment plate and the inner step adjustment plate, which is<br>
thicker that the former. Thus, even a slight step difference can be designated<br>
5	in order to appropriately balance the contact pressure applied to the<br>
circumferential beads and the outer bead.<br>
[0016]	In the present invention, relative to the claw-like protrusions<br>
inserted into the engagement holes and folded over, claw-like -protrusion<br>
clearance holes may be formed in the two base plates to be aligned in the<br>
10	direction of thickness of the metal gasket. By employing the claw-like-<br>
protrusion clearance holes, a phenomenon can be prevented that, at positions<br>
outside the circumferential beads in the radial direction, the claw-like<br>
protrusions of either the outer step adjustment plate or the inner step<br>
adjustment plate, are folded over and overlap the other plate, and are<br>
15	overlapped with the base plate. Further, it is possible to prevent claw-like<br>
protrusions that function as shims from partially reducing the contact pressure<br>
applied to the circumferential beads.<br>
[0017]	Furthermore, according to the present invention, relative to the<br>
claw-like protrusions that are inserted into the engagement holes and folded<br>
20	over, claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses facing the claw-like protrusions<br>
may be formed in the base plate to be aligned in the direction of the thickness<br>
of the metal gasket. By employing the claw-like-protrusion clearance<br>
recesses, a phenomenon can also be prevented whereby, at positions outside<br>
the circumferential beads in the radial direction, the claw-like protrusions of<br>
25	either the outer step adjustment plate or the inner step adjustment plate are<br>
folded over and overlap the other plate, and are overlapped with the base plate.<br>
Further, it is possible to prevent the claw-like protrusions that can function<br>
as shims from partially reducing the contact pressure applied to the<br>
circumferential beads. In addition, with these claw-like-protrusion clearance<br>
30	recesses, since the base plate is not open at the positions of the claw-like-<br>
protrusions, the circulation of cooling water between the cylinder block and<br>
the cylinder head at unnecessary locations can be avoided.<br>
[0018]	Further, according to the present invention, the inner step<br>
	05915(7/27)<br><br>
-8-<br>
adjustment plate may have circumferential beads, having a crescent shape in<br>
cross section, that are arranged in the direction of the thickness of the metal<br>
gasket relative to the circumferential beads of the base plates, and that are<br>
projected in opposite directions. According to this arrangement, for the two-<br>
5	plate or three-plate lamination metal gasket, circumferential beads to be<br>
overlapped can be increased, and the sealing for the gas produced by the<br>
combustions in the cylinder bores can be improved.<br>
[0019]	In addition, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a<br>
single-plate type of the present invention, an outer step adjustment plate and a<br>
10	thicker inner step adjustment plate are coupled together and positioned by<br>
fitting claw-like protrusions into the engagement holes thereof. And by<br>
employing the difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate<br>
and the inner step adjustment plate, the step between the circumferential beads<br>
and the outer beads of the base plate, and the contact pressure applied to the<br>
15	circumferential beads can be adjusted.<br>
[0020]	Therefore, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of a<br>
single-plate type of the present invention, the lower limit for the step<br>
adjustment can be the lower limit of the difference in the thickness of the<br>
outer base plate and the inner base plate, which is thicker than the former.<br>
20	Thus, even a slight step difference can be arranged in order to appropriately<br>
balance the contact pressure applied to the circumferential beads and the outer<br>
bead.<br>
[0021]	According to the present individual inventions, the claw-like<br>
protrusions may be provided for the outer step adjustment plate or the outer<br>
25	base plate, and the engagement holes may be formed in the inner step<br>
adjustment plate or in the inner base plate. With this arrangement, since the<br>
claw-like protrusions to be folded over are made of a thinner plate than either<br>
the outer step adjustment plate or the inner step adjustment plate, the<br>
processing for bending the claw-like protrusions can be improved.<br>

embodiment; Fig. 5 is a plan view of the inner step adjustment plate of the<br>

a metal gasket; 2, a base plate; 3, an outer step adjustment plate; and 4, an<br>
15	inner step adjustment plate.<br>
[0024]	In the first embodiment, the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 is a<br>
three-plate lamination type that, as shown in Fig. 2, has two base plates 2,<br>
which are metal plates made of stainless steel. As shown in Fig. 3, each of<br>
these base plates 2 includes: a plurality (three in the drawing) of cylinder<br>
20	holes 2a, which are formed corresponding to the cylinder bores in a cylinder<br>
block of an engine, an internal combustion engine, with which the metal<br>
gasket 1 is to be assembled and on which a cylinder head is to be mounted;<br>
circumferential beads 2b having a both-sided sloped angular shape in cross<br>
section, which are formed around the peripheries of the cylinder holes 2a;<br>
25	multiple cooling water holes 2c, which are formed, outside the peripheries of<br>
the circumferential beads 2b, corresponding to the cooling water jacket of the<br>
cylinder block and the cooling water holes in the cylinder head; and an outer<br>
bead 2d having a one-sided sloped shape in cross section, which is formed and<br>
positioned so as to entirely enclose the circumferential beads 2b and the<br>
30	cooling water holes 2c.<br>
[0025]	Furthermore, a plurality of lubricating oil holes 2e, a plurality<br>
(eight in the drawing) of bolt holes 2f, into which head bolts are to be inserted<br>
to secure the cylinder head to the cylinder block, and grommet holes 2g,<br>
	05915(10/27)<br><br>
-11-<br>
which will be described later, are formed outside the outer beads 2d of the two<br>
base plates 2. The circumferential beads 2b of these two base plates 2 are<br>
positioned in the direction of thickness of the gasket 1, and are projected<br>
inward, in opposite directions, and facing each other. The outer beads 2d of<br>
5	the two base plates 2 are also positioned in the direction of thickness of the<br>
gasket 1, and are projected inward, opposite directions, and facing each other.<br>
[0026]	Further, in the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the first<br>
embodiment, as shown in Fig. 2, an outer step adjustment plate 3, which is a<br>
metal plate that, for example, is thinner than the base plate 2 and is made of<br>
10	stainless steel, and an inner step adjustment plate 4, which is a metal plate that,<br>
for example, is as thick as the base plate 2 and is made of stainless steel, are<br>
inserted between the two base plates 2. As shown in Fig. 4, the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 is extended from the position corresponding to the cooling<br>
water jacket of the cylinder block of the engine to the position of the outer<br>
15	end area of the two base plates 2. This outer step adjustment plate 3<br>
includes: a plurality (four for each cylinder hole 2a in the base plate 2 in the<br>
drawing) claw-like protrusions 3a, which are projected inwardly from the<br>
positions on the inner edge consonant with the cooling water jacket; semi-<br>
circular or semi-oval clearance recesses 3b, which are formed in the inner<br>
20	edge corresponding to the cooling water holes 2c of the base plates 2; and a<br>
plurality of holes 3c and grommet holes 3d that will be described later, which<br>
are consonant respectively with the lubricating oil holes 2e and the bolt holes<br>
2f of the base plates 2. Referring to Fig. 2, the area near the claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a is lowered in advance to the half bead state, so that the inner<br>
25	step adjustment plate 4 and the outer step adjustment plate 3 are located on<br>
the same plane, and the upper faces of the claw-like protrusions 3a are aligned<br>
with the lower face of the inner step adjustment plate 4. However, instead of<br>
lowering the area to the half bead state, as shown in Fig. 6 flat claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a may be aligned under the inner step adjustment plate 4. Thus,<br>
30	when the gasket is held between the cylinder block and the cylinder head, the<br>
area near the claw-like protrusions 3a will be displaced to the half bead state,<br>
and the inner step adjustment plate 4 and the outer step adjustment plate 3 will<br>
be aligned on the same plane.<br>
	05915(11/27)<br><br>
-12-<br>
[0027] On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5, the inner step adjustment<br>
plate 4 in this case is extended from the positions of the inner edges of the<br>
cylinder holes 2a, which are the inner positions of the circumferential beads<br>
2b of the base plates 2, to the position of the cooling water jacket. And the<br>
5	inner step adjustment plate 4 includes engagement holes (rectangular holes in<br>
the drawing) 4a, which are located at positions consonant with the multiple<br>
claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step adjustment plate 3 for the insertion<br>
of the claw- s 3a, and also includes: cylinder holes 4b, consonant with the<br>
cylinder holes 2a of the individual base plates 2; holes 4c, consonant with the<br>
10	cooling water holes 2c of the base plates 2; and semi-circular or semi-oval<br>
clearance recesses 4d, which are formed in the outer edge consonant with the<br>
cooling water jacket, and are located at positions consonant with the cooling<br>
water holes 2c of the base plate 2.<br>
[0028]	Further, as shown in Figs. 1 and 6, in the metal gasket for cylinder<br>
15	head 1 of the first embodiment, the claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 are inserted into the engagement holes 4a of the inner step<br>
adjustment plate 4 from below the inner step adjustment plate4, and the<br>
portions projecting outward from the engagement holes 4a are folded over<br>
onto the inner step adjustment plate 4. In this manner, the claw-like<br>
20	protrusions 3a are hooked through the engagement holes 4a, and the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 and the inner step adjustment plate 4 are coupled, so that<br>
portions other than the claw-like protrusions 3a do not overlap each other in<br>
the direction of the thickness. Further, in order that the metal gasket for<br>
cylinder head 1 of the first embodiment can be appropriately used for a closed<br>
25	deck type cylinder block, wherein the deck face, other than the cooling water<br>
holes, is closed at the position of the cooling water jacket, as shown in Figs. 1,<br>
2 and 3, the two base plates 2 include claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h,<br>
which are aligned in the direction of the thickness of the metal gasket for<br>
cylinder head 1 in order to permit the entry of the claw-like protrusions 3a<br>
30	that have been inserted into respective engagement holes 4a and have been<br>
folded over.<br>
[0029]	In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, in the metal gasket for cylinder<br>
head 1 of the first embodiment, common grommets 5 are inserted through the<br>
	05915(12/27)<br><br>
-13-<br>
grommet holes 2g, 3d, of the two base plates 2 and the outer step adjustment<br>
plate 3 located between them, that are aligned with each other, and protruding<br>
parts of the common grommets 5 are folded over and cramped, so that the two<br>
base plates 2 and the outer step adjustment plates 3 and the inner step<br>
5	adjustment plates 4 located between them are correctly positioned. It should<br>
be noted that since these grommet holes 2g, 3d are located outside the<br>
positions of the cylinder block and the cylinder head of the engine, the<br>
grommets 5 will not be held between the cylinder block and the cylinder head<br>
of the engine and reduce the contact pressure applied to the beads 2b, 2d.<br>
10	[0030]	For the metal gasket cylinder head 1 of the first embodiment<br>
described above, the outer step adjustment plate 3 and the thicker inner step<br>
adjustment plate 3, which are located between the two base plates 2, are<br>
coupled together and positioned by inserting the claw-like protrusions 3a of<br>
one of these plates, i.e., the outer step adjustment plate 3, into the engagement<br>
15	holes 3a of the other plate, i.e., the inner step adjustment plate 3. And by<br>
employing the difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate 3<br>
and the inner step adjustment plate 4, which is thicker than the former, the<br>
step difference between the circumferential beads 2b of the base plate 2 and<br>
the outer bead 2d, as well as the contact pressure on the circumferential beads<br>
20	2b, is adjusted.<br>
[0031]	Therefore, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of a<br>
three-plate lamination type of the first embodiment 1, since the contact<br>
pressure applied to the circumferential beads 2b of the base plates 2 can be<br>
increased by employing the step difference that is adjusted by altering the<br>
25	difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate 3 and the inner<br>
step adjustment plate 4, which is thicker than the former, the sealing of the<br>
gas of combustion in the cylinder bores can be improved. Furthermore, since<br>
the lower limit of the adjustment of the step is the lower limit of the<br>
difference in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate 3 and the inner<br>
30	step adjustment plate 4, which is thicker than the former, even a small step<br>
difference can be arranged in order to obtain an appropriate contact pressure<br>
balance for the circumferential beads 2b and the outer bead 2d.<br>
[0032]	In addition, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
	05915(13/27)<br><br>
-14-<br>
first embodiment, the two base plates 2 include, relative to the claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a that have been inserted into the respective engagement holes 4a<br>
and folded over, the claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h that are aligned<br>
in the direction of the thickness of the metal gasket 1. Thus, for the use in a<br>
5	cylinder block of a closed deck type, the claw-like-protrusion clearance holes<br>
2h, which are formed both in the base plate 2, which faces the cylinder block,<br>
and in the base plate 2, which faces the cylinder head, can prevent the<br>
appearance of a state wherein the claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 are held between the two base plates 2, after being folded<br>
10	over and overlapping the inner step adjustment plate 4 at positions outside the<br>
circumferential beads 2b in the radial direction. Further, a phenomenon<br>
wherein the claw-like protrusions 3a function as shims, and partially reduce<br>
the contact pressure applied to the circumferential beads 2b, can be prevented.<br>
[0033] Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head,<br>
15	according to a second embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 8 is a<br>
plan view of a base plate (the lower one in Fig. 7) that faces the cylinder block<br>
of the metal basket according to the second embodiment. The portions in the<br>
drawings corresponding to those in the previous embodiment are denoted by<br>
using the same references. The metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the second<br>
20	embodiment is a three-plate lamination type, as of the first embodiment, and<br>
differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the first embodiment only<br>
in that: in order to be appropriately used for an open deck cylinder block<br>
wherein the deck face is opened widely at the position of a cooling water<br>
jacket, a base plate (a lower base plate in the drawing that faces the cylinder<br>
25	block) 2 differs from the base plate 2 in Fig. 3; and as shown in Fig. 8, claw-<br>
like-protrusion clearance holes 2h are not formed. The other portions are<br>
arranged in the same manner as for the metal gasket 1 of the first embodiment.<br>
[0034]	With the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the second<br>
embodiment, the same operational effects as in the first embodiment are also<br>
30	obtained. Further, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
second embodiment, the base plate (the upper base plate in the drawing) 2, of<br>
the two base plates 2, that faces the cylinder head includes the claw-like-<br>
protrusion clearance holes 2h that are aligned in the direction of the thickness<br>
	05915(14/27)<br><br>
-15-<br>
of the metal gasket 1, relative to the respective claw-like protrusions 3a that<br>
are inserted into the respective engagement holes 4a and folded over. Thus,<br>
for use in an open deck cylinder block, the claw-like-protrusion clearance<br>
holes 2h, which are formed in the base plate 2 that faces the cylinder head,<br>
5	can prevent the appearance of a state wherein the folded over portions of the<br>
claw-like protrusions 3a are pressed against the deck face of the cylinder head,<br>
and are held between the two base plates 2 at positions outside the<br>
circumferential beads 2b in the radial direction of the cylinder holes 2a.<br>
Further, a phenomenon wherein the folded portions of the claw-like<br>
10	protrusions 3a function as shims, reducing the contact pressure on the<br>
circumferential beads 2b, can also be prevented.<br>
[0035]	Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to a third embodiment of this invention, and Fig. 10 is a perspective<br>
view of a cross section of the metal gasket of the third embodiment that is<br>
15	near the same position as that in Fig. 9. In the drawings, the portions<br>
corresponding to those in the previous embodiment are denoted by using the<br>
same reference numerals. A metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the third<br>
embodiment, which is the same three-plate lamination type as that of the<br>
second embodiment, differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
20	second embodiment only in that: in order to be appropriately used for an<br>
open deck type cylinder block, wherein the deck face is opened widely at the<br>
location of a cooling water jacket, unlike the base plate 2 in Fig. 8, a base<br>
plate (a lower base plate in Fig. 9) 2 that faces a cylinder block includes, as<br>
shown in Figs. 9 and 10, claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, which are,<br>
25	for example, embossed by pressure applied at positions corresponding to the<br>
claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h of the base plate 2 in Fig. 3 and are<br>
directed toward claw-like protrusions 3a while, like the base plate 2 in Fig. 8,<br>
a base plate (an upper base plate in Fig. 9) 2 that faces a cylinder head does<br>
not include claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h; and claw-like protrusions<br>
30	3a, on an outer step adjustment plate 3, are inserted into engagement holes 4a<br>
in an inner step adjustment plate 4, from above the inner step adjustment plate<br>
4, and the portions that extend outward, from the engagement holes 4a, are<br>
folded over, under the inner step adjustment plate. The other portions are<br>
	05915(15/27)<br><br>
-16-<br>
arranged in the same manner as are those for the metal gasket for cylinder<br>
head 2 of the second embodiment.<br>
[0036]	According to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the third<br>
embodiment, the lower base plate 2, which faces the cylinder block, also<br>
5	includes the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, which are aligned in<br>
the direction of the thickness of the metal gasket 1, relative to the respective<br>
claw-like protrusions 3a that are inserted into the engagement holes 4a and<br>
folded over. Thus, the convex portions, which are extended outside the lower<br>
base plate 2, corresponding to the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i<br>
10	formed in this base plate 2, enter the cooling water jacket opening of the deck<br>
face of the cylinder block, while the claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 enter the claw-like protrusion clearance recesses 2i that are<br>
formed in the lower base plate 2. Therefore, the same operational effects can<br>
be acquired as those obtained in the second embodiment. Further, according<br>
15	to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 for the third embodiment, since the<br>
opening of the base plate 2 is prevented at the positions of the claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a because of the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, the<br>
circulation of cooling water, between the cylinder block and the cylinder head,<br>
at an unnecessary locations can be avoided.<br>
20	[0037]	Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, and in the drawing,<br>
the same portions as in the previous embodiments are denoted by the same<br>
reference numerals. A metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the fourth<br>
embodiment, which is of the same three-plate lamination type as of the first<br>
25	embodiment, differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the first<br>
embodiment only in that: in order to be appropriately used for a closed deck<br>
type cylinder block, wherein the deck face, other than the cooling water holes,<br>
is closed at the location of a cooling water jacket, two base plates 2, in<br>
addition to those of the first embodiment, include claw-like-protrusion<br>
30	clearance holes 2h, and an inner step adjustment plate 4 includes an<br>
circumferential bead 4e, which has a crescent shape in cross section, that is<br>
aligned with circumferential beads 2b on the two base plates 2, in the<br>
direction of the thickness of the metal gasket 1, that are projected in directions<br>
	05915(16/27)<br><br>
-17-<br>
opposite to those of the beads 2b; and accordingly, the circumferential bead<br>
2b and the outer bead 2d on the base plate 2 that faces the cylinder head are<br>
projected in the direction the reverse of that in the first embodiment. The<br>
other portions are arranged in the same manner as are those for the metal<br>
5	gasket for cylinder head 1 of the first embodiment.<br>
[0038]	For the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the fourth embodiment,<br>
the same operating effects can be obtained as are obtained in the first<br>
embodiment above. Further, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
1 of the fourth embodiment, the number of circumferential beads to be<br>
10	laminated in a metal gasket for cylinder head of a three-plate lamination type<br>
can be increased, and the sealing provided for combustion gas in the cylinder<br>
bores can be even more improved.<br>
[0039]	Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, and the portions in<br>
15	the drawings corresponding to those in the previous embodiments are denoted<br>
by using the same references. The metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
fifth embodiment is a three-plate lamination type, as of the fourth embodiment,<br>
and differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the fourth<br>
embodiment only in that: in order to be appropriately used for an open deck<br>
20	cylinder block wherein the deck face is opened widely at the position of a<br>
cooling water jacket, a base plate (a lower base plate in the drawing) 2 that<br>
faces the cylinder block differs from the base plate 2 in Fig. 3; as shown in<br>
Figs. 8 and 12, claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h are not formed. The<br>
other portions are arranged in the same manner as for the metal gasket 1 of the<br>
25	fourth embodiment.<br>
[0040]	With the metal gasket cylinder head 1 of the fifth embodiment, the<br>
same operational effects as in the fourth embodiment are also obtained.<br>
Further, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the fifth<br>
embodiment, the base plate (the upper base plate in the drawing) 2, of the two<br>
30	base plates 2, that faces the cylinder head includes the claw-like-protrusion<br>
clearance holes 2h that are aligned in the direction of the thickness of the<br>
metal gasket 1, relative to the respective claw-like protrusions 3a that are<br>
inserted into the respective engagement holes 4a and folded over. Thus, for<br>
	05915(17/27)<br><br>
-18-<br>
use in an open deck cylinder block, the claw-like-protrusion clearance holes<br>
2h, which are formed in the base plate 2 that faces the cylinder head, can<br>
prevent the appearance of a state wherein the folded over portions of the claw-<br>
like protrusions 3a are pressed against the deck face of the cylinder head, and<br>
5	are held between the two base plates 2 at positions outside the circumferential<br>
beads 2b in the radial direction of the cylinder holes 2a. Further, a<br>
phenomenon wherein the folded portions of the claw-like protrusions 3a<br>
function as shims, reducing the contact pressure on the circumferential beads<br>
2b, can also be prevented.<br>
10	[0041]	Fig. 13 is a cross sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to a sixth embodiment of this invention, and in the drawings, the<br>
portions corresponding to those in the previous embodiments are denoted by<br>
using the same reference numerals. A metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
sixth embodiment, which is the same three-plate lamination type as that of the<br>
15	fifth embodiment, differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the fifth<br>
embodiment only in that: in order to be appropriately used for an open deck<br>
type cylinder block, wherein the deck face is opened widely at the location of<br>
a cooling water jacket, unlike the base plate 2 in Fig. 8, a base plate (a lower<br>
base plate in the drawing) 2 that faces a cylinder block includes, as shown in<br>
20	Fig. 13, claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, which are, for example,<br>
embossed by pressure applied at positions corresponding to the claw-like-<br>
protrusion clearance holes 2h of the base plate 2 in Fig. 3 and are directed<br>
toward claw-like protrusions 3a while, like the base plate 2 in Fig. 8, a base<br>
plate (an upper base plate in Fig. 13) 2 that faces a cylinder head does not<br>
25	include claw-like-protrusion clearance holes 2h; and claw-like protrusions 3a,<br>
on an outer step adjustment plate 3, are inserted into engagement holes 4a in<br>
an inner step adjustment plate 4, from above the inner step adjustment plate 4,<br>
and the portions that extend outward, from the engagement holes 4a, are<br>
folded over, under the inner step adjustment plate. The other portions are<br>
30	arranged in the same manner as are those for the metal gasket for cylinder<br>
head 1 of the fifth embodiment.<br>
[0042]	According to the metal gasket cylinder head 1 of the sixth<br>
embodiment, the lower base plate 2, which faces the cylinder block, also<br>
	05915(18/27)<br><br>
-19-<br>
includes the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, which are aligned in<br>
the direction of the thickness of the metal gasket 1, relative to the respective<br>
claw-like protrusions 3a that are inserted into the engagement holes 4a and<br>
folded over. Thus, the convex portions, which are extended outside the lower<br>
5	base plate 2, corresponding to the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i<br>
formed in this base plate 2, enter the cooling water jacket opening of the deck<br>
face of the cylinder block, while the claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 3 enter the claw-like protrusion clearance recesses 2i that are<br>
formed in the lower base plate 2. Therefore, the same operational effects can<br>
10	be acquired as those obtained in the fifth embodiment. Further, according to<br>
the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 for the sixth embodiment, since the<br>
opening of the base plate 2 is prevented at the positions of the claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a because of the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, the<br>
circulation of cooling water, between the cylinder block and the cylinder head,<br>
15	at an unnecessary locations can be avoided.<br>
[0043]	Fig. 14 is a cross-sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to a seventh embodiment of this invention, and in the drawing,<br>
portions corresponding to those in the previous embodiments are denoted by<br>
using the same reference numerals. A metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
20	seventh embodiment, unlike those in the first to the sixth embodiments, is of a<br>
two-plate lamination type, and is arranged by laminating one base plate 2,<br>
which has the same structure as the base plate (an upper base plate in the<br>
drawing) 2 of the first embodiment that faces a cylinder head, and a one step<br>
adjustment plate, which is obtained when an outer step adjustment plate 3 has<br>
25	the same structure as the outer step adjustment plate 3 of the fourth<br>
embodiment, except that an outer bead 3e, corresponding to the outer bead 2d<br>
of the base plate 2, is coupled with an inner step adjustment plate 4 having the<br>
same structure as the inner step adjustment plate 4 of the fourth embodiment,<br>
and that the direction in which the circumferential bead 4e is projected is<br>
30	changed and is the reverse of that in the fourth embodiment, by fitting claw-<br>
like protrusions 3a, for the outer step adjustment plate 3, into engagement<br>
holes 4a in the inner step adjustment plate 4, from below the inner step<br>
adjustment plate 4, in the same manner as in the previous first, second, fourth<br>
	05915(19/27)<br><br>
-20-<br>
and fifth embodiments, and by folding over the claw-like protrusions 3a on<br>
the inner step adjustment plate 4.<br>
[0044]	According to the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the seventh<br>
embodiment, the same operating effects as in the first to the sixth<br>
5	embodiments can be acquired with the two-plate lamination arrangement.<br>
[0045]	Fig. 15 is a cross-sectional view of a metal gasket for cylinder head<br>
according to an eighth embodiment of this invention, and in the drawing,<br>
portions corresponding to those in the previous embodiments are denoted by<br>
using the same reference numerals. A metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
10	eighth embodiment is the of same two-plate lamination type as of the seventh<br>
embodiment, and differs from the metal gasket for cylinder head 1 of the<br>
seventh embodiment only in that: the locations of a base plate 2 and a step<br>
adjustment plate are vertically the reverse of those in the seventh embodiment;<br>
at positions corresponding to the claw-like -protrusion clearance holes 2h of<br>
15	the base plate 2 in Fig. 1, the base plate 2 located below, which faces a<br>
cylinder block, includes, as shown in Fig. 15, claw-like-protrusion clearance<br>
recesses 2i that are embossed, for example, by pressing and are directed claw-<br>
like protrusions 3a; and claw-like protrusions 3a of an outer step adjustment<br>
plate 3 are inserted from above into engagement holes 4a in an inner step<br>
20	adjustment plate 4, and the portions extending outward from the engagement<br>
holes 4a are folded over under the inner step adjustment plate 4. The other<br>
portions are formed in the same manner as in the metal gasket for cylinder<br>
head 1 of the seventh embodiment.<br>
[0046] According to the above described metal gasket for cylinder head of<br>
25	the eighth embodiment, the base plate 2 that faces the cylinder head also<br>
includes claw-like -protrusion clearance recesses 2i that are aligned in the<br>
direction of the thickness of the metal gasket 1, relative to the claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a that are inserted into the engagement holes 4a and folded over.<br>
Therefore, the convex portions, which are extended outside the base plate 2<br>
30	corresponding to the claw-like -protrusion clearance recesses 2i formed in this<br>
base plate 2, are entered inside the cooling water holes in the deck face of the<br>
cylinder head, and the claw-like protrusions 3a of the outer step adjustment<br>
plate 3 are entered into the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i formed<br>
	05915(20/27)<br><br>
-21-<br>
in the base plate 2. Therefore, the same operational effects as obtained in the<br>
seventh embodiment can be acquired. Furthermore, according to the metal<br>
gasket for cylinder head 1 of the eighth embodiment, since the opening of the<br>
base plate 2 is prevented at the positions of the claw-like protrusions 3a<br>
5	because of the claw-like-protrusion clearance recesses 2i, the circulation of<br>
cooling water between the cylinder block and the cylinder head at unnecessary<br>
locations can be avoided.<br>
[0047]	An explanation has been given by employing illustrated examples;<br>
however, the present invention is not limited to the above described examples.<br>
10	For example, although not shown, an outer base plate (denoted, for easy<br>
understanding, by the same reference numeral as used for the outer step<br>
adjustment plate) 3, which has the same structure as the outer step adjustment<br>
plate 3 in the seventh or eighth embodiment, and an inner base plate (denoted,<br>
for easy understanding, by the same reference numeral as used for the inner<br>
15	step adjustment plate) 4, which has the same structure as the outer step<br>
adjustment plate 4 in the fourth embodiment, may be coupled together, in the<br>
same manner as in the previous embodiments, by folding over claw-like<br>
protrusions 3a on the outer base plate 3 that have been inserted into the<br>
individual engagement holes 4a of the inner base plate 4, so that a metal<br>
20	gasket for cylinder head of a single plate type may be provided. In this case,<br>
the claw-like protrusions 3a need only be projected inside the cooling water<br>
holes in the cylinder head or the cooling water jacket opening, or the cooling<br>
water hole in the cylinder block.<br>
[0048]	Further, in this invention, the individual claw-like protrusions may<br>
25	be formed on the inner step adjustment plate or the inner base plate, and the<br>
engagement holes may be formed in the outer step adjustment plate or in the<br>
outer base plate.<br>
[0049]	Furthermore, in this invention, claw-like-protrusion clearance<br>
recesses may be formed in the two base plates. In addition, the metal gasket<br>
30	for cylinder head of the third, sixth and eighth embodiments can also be applied<br>
for a closed deck type cylinder block. In this case, when convex portions<br>
project outside the base plate, corresponding to the claw-like-protrusion<br>
recesses formed in the base plate, these convex portions need only be<br>
	05915(21/27)<br><br>
-22-<br>
projected inside the cooling water holes in the deck face of the cylinder block.<br>
[0050]	Moreover, in this invention, the claw-like protrusion clearance<br>
recesses may be formed by electric discharge machining, so that<br>
corresponding convex portions do not project outside the base plate.<br>
5	Industrial Applicability<br>
[0051]	In conclusion, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of<br>
this invention, the step difference can be adjusted by employing a difference<br>
in the thickness of the outer step adjustment plate and the inner step<br>
adjustment plate, which is thicker than the former, and the lower limit of the<br>
10	step adjustment is equal to the lower limit of the difference in the thickness of<br>
the outer step adjustment plate and the inner step adjustment plate, which is<br>
thicker than the former. Therefore, even a small step difference can be<br>
arranged in order to appropriately balance a contact pressure applied to the<br>
circumferential beads and the outer bead.<br>
15	[0052]	In addition, according to the metal gasket for cylinder head of this<br>
invention, since the outer step adjustment plate and the inner step adjustment<br>
plate are coupled by press machining, a welding equipment and processing are<br>
not required, compared with when these plates are to be welded and coupled,<br>
so that a gasket can be manufactured at a lower cost.<br>
