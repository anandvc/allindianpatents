COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"2,,3,-DIDEOXY-3,-FLUORO-5'-O-(2-(L-VALYLOXY)-PROPIONYL)GUANOSINE"<br>
MEDIVIR AB, of Lunastigen 7, S-141 44 Huddinge, Sweden,<br><br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes  the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to the field of prodrugs, that is novel derivatives of otherwise known and proven drugs which release that drug in active or pro-active form in vivo. The enzymatic and/or chemical cleavage of the compounds of the present invention occurs in such a manner that the parent drug is released and the moiety or moieties split off remain non-toxic or are metabolized so that non-toxic or acceptable amounts of metabolic products are produced.The present compounds thus modify the in vivo availability of the parent compound compared to what would be the case if the parent compound was to be administered itself. For instance the prodrugs of the invention may give higher bioavailabilities, varied bioavailability kinetics or bioavailabilities with a decreased interpersonal spread.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
WO97/30051 and WO 98/21223 describe prodrugs of nucleoside analogues comprising a fatty acid ester and an amino acid ester, optionally combined on a linker structure which is in turn bonded to the nucleoside. As shown in the examples of WO 97/30051, the presence of the fatty acid component was essential to good bioavailability.<br>
J Med Chem 39(1) 10-18 1996 describes a number of acyloxymethyl ethers of the enolic drug oxindole and indicate that the amino acyl variants have poorer bioaviailability that the mother substance.<br>
J Med Chem 22 657-661 (1979) and DE 2112057 describe valyloxymethyl esters of lactamcarboxy functions of various penicillins although to our knowledge none have shown clinical promise.<br><br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
In a ccordance with a first aspect of the invention there are provided pharmaceutical<br>
compounds of the formula:<br>
D*-Linker+ (R,')fc-R,<br>
where	R2 and R2 (if present) is the amide or ester residue of an aliphatic<br>
amino acid,<br>
k is 0 or 1.<br>
D* is a Drug residue bearing an accessible function selected from amine, hydroxy and carboxy,<br>
Linker* is an at least bifunctional linker comprising a first function bound to said accessible function spaced from a second function forming an amide or acyl bond with the aliphatic amino acid,<br>
wherein the compound is free from long chain fatty acid esters; and with the provisos that Linker* does not consist solely of alkoxy when the Drug comprises a lactamcarboxy or enolic hydroxy function and that the Drug is not a monohydric nucleoside.<br>
The invention further provides novel intermediates useful for denvatising accessible hydroxy, carboxy or amino functions of Drugs to prepare prodrugs as described in the foregoing paragraph. Certain of these novel intermediates are also useful for derivatising other functions on drugs, as descnbed and claimed in our co-pending international application filed 30 March 1999 and claiming priority from SE 9801216-4.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides the use of a structure of the formula -Linker* (R2')k-R2as a prodrug moiety for a drug bearing an accesible hydroxy, carboxy or amino function.<br>
By the use of the invention the pharmacokinetics of a broad range of orally administered drugs are enhanced, for instance by improving absolute bioavailability or by providing a more even release of the mother compound or by providing for a reduced interpersonal spread in pharmacokinetic performance. However the compounds of the invention are not limited to those based on orally administered<br><br>
drugs as the prodrugs of the invention, when paremerally administered, provide enhanced pharmacokinetic performance, for instance by improving solubility, while still allowing for efficient release of the mother compound.<br>
Drug residue as used in its conventional significance, that is implying that during linkage a hydrogen or hydroxy has been eliminated from an accessible amino, carboxy or hydroxy function on the Drug. The amine function on the Drug can be a primary amine (-NH,) or a secondary amine (-NH-).<br>
The expression difunctional in the context of the linker group means that the linker has at least one hydroxy or amine function available for esterification or amide bonding with R2, or a carboxyl function available for amide bonding with the free a-amine function of R-,. Spaced therefrom on the difunctional linker is a further functional group for linkage to a cooperating function on the Drug such as hydroxy, carboxy or amino.<br>
The linker may in fact be trifunctional, that is the linker has at least three functions including two independently selected from hydroxy, amine or carboxy, the amine and hydroxy function(s) being available for esterification/amide bonding with the carboxyl functions of a pair of R,, or the carboxy function(s) on the linker being available for amide bonding with the free a-amine function of R3. These hydroxy/amine/carboxy functions are spaced from a further functional group for linkage with a cooperating hydroxy, carboxy or amine function on the drug. Other trifunctional linker groups may comprise a first hydroxy, amine or carboxy function cooperating with R2, a function cooperating with the drug and a further functional group either underivatised such as hydroxy, carboxy, amine etc or alternatively protected with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable protecting groups.<br>
The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the pharmaceutical compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents therefor. Additional aspects of the invention provide methods of medical treatment or prophylaxis comprising the administration of the pharmaceutical<br><br>
compounds of the invention to a human or animal suffering from or prone to the ailment to which the respective Drug is applicable.<br>
Convenient linker groups, for instance when the Drug compnses an amine or hydroxy function, include those of the Formulae IIa<br><br><br><br>
llaa<br>
where	A and A' are independently<br>
an ester linkage between an hydroxy on the linker and the carboxy on R:, or an amide linkage between an amine on the linker and a carboxy on R2 Q is a structure:<br><br>
or Q is a monocyclic, saturated or unsaturated carbo- or heterocycle with 4, 5 or 6 ring atoms;<br>
Alk is absent, C1-C4 alkylene or C2-C4 alkenylene; T is a bond, -O- or -N(R4)-,<br>
V is a bond or a structure of the formula IIbb or IIcc:<br><br><br>
R2, and R4 are independently hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl; and m and n are independently 0, 1 or 2; k is 0 (that is the branch is absent )or 1<br><br>
A number of useful hetero or carbocycles for Q as a nng are defined below which is preferably an aromatic group such as pyridine, furyl, lmidazol etc or especially phenyl, such as aromatic moieties wherein the arm(s) beanng the or each R: group are respectively para and meta or both meta to the remainder of the linker.<br>
Where the Drug comprises a carboxyl function, the linker may compnse a structure of the formulae VIII:<br><br><br>
where A, A', Q, Alk, k m, and n are as defined for Formula Ha.<br>
Preferably, however, when the Drug compnses a carboxy function, the di- or trifunctional linker group is a structure of Formulae lid (that is a compound of Formulae IIa, wherein T is 0 and V is a structure of the formula libb):<br><br>
In structure lid, R4 is preferably hydrogen and R4 is ethyl, phenyl, but especially methyl or hydrogen, or R4 and R4 together define isopropyl.<br>
Particularly convenient structures when the drug compnses an hydroxy function include the corresponding structures to:<br>
formula 11 e*, that is<br><br><br><br>
formula II f*, that is<br>
R<br><br>
I If*<br>
Formula Id*, that is<br>
O R2 — O — Alk—II- 0 — Drug<br>
Id* A favoured structure within formula IIa has the formula:<br><br>
which breaks down in vivo to the nature identical glycenc acid. Particularly preferred are compounds derived from D-glyceric acid.<br>
Thus preferred pharmaceutical compounds of the invention will compnse a [(R) 2,3-bis-(L-valyloxy)-propionyl] or [(R) 2,3-bis-(L-isoleucyloxy)-propionyl] moiety.<br>
A preferred group of linker(R2')-R3 structures comprise glycerol denvatives of the formula Ik<br><br><br>
lIe<br>
or the corresponding 2,3 enaniiomer, where A is hydrogen or the acyl residue of an aliphatic L-amino acid ester, A' is the acyl residue of an aliphatic ammo acid residue and D is a C1-C6 saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid residue. Trifunctional linkers of the formula He are hydrolysed or otherwise break down in vivo to release the nature identical compounds glycerol, the L-amino acid, the fatty acid (if present) and the dicarboxylic acid, each of which are generally safely metabolised and/or excreted by the body. Preferably A and A' are both the same residue, particularly residues of L-valine or L-isoleucine.<br>
Particularly preferred dicarboxylic acid residues include those derived from oxalic, malonic, tartronic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, glutaric, glutaconic, citraconic, itaconic, ethidine-malonic, mesaconic, adipic, allylmalonic, propylidenemalonic, hydromuconic, pyrocinchonic and muconic acids and the like. The dicarboxylic acid residue may be optionally substituted.<br>
Several of the abovementioned dicarboxylic acids can themselves define a Afunctional linker. For instance hydroxy-substituted dicarboxylic acids such as tartaric acid or malic acid offer a number of configurations within the scope of the invention. Taking tartaric acid as an example a carboxyl function is available for estenfication with an hydroxy function on the drug (optionally via a difunctional linker). The hydroxy function(s) are available for estenfication with the respective carboxyl functions of the R, amino acid while the remaining carboxy group can be free, or optionally protected, for instance with a conventional pharmaceutical^ acceptable ester such as the methyl or ethyl ester.<br><br><br><br>
Favoured lingers of the tananc acid senes above can be genencally depicted as Formula He:<br><br>
where R2 is as shown above, p, q and r are each independently 0 to 5, preferably 0 or 1 and Rv is the free acid, or a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carboxy protecting group, such as the methyl, benzyl or especially the ethyl ester.<br>
Favoured linkers of the malic series have the formula IIf:<br><br><br>

terminal carboxy function.<br>
A funher preferred prodrug moiety, especially for Drugs containing hydroxy groups which are not prone to electron withdrawal include a-co hydroxyalkanoic acid denvatives where R-, is esterified to the terminal hydroxy group. ]n these compounds hydrolysis and removal of the R2 group in vivo leaves a reactive terminal radical which will tend to cyclize and prompt the effective release of the mother drug.Linkers of this aspect of the invention are conveniently prepared from a-hydroxy co-carboxylic acids such as carbonrc acid, glycollic acid, hydroxypropanoic acid, hydroxybutyric acid, hvdroxwalenc acid or hydroxycaproic acid.<br>

Linkers prepared from co-hydroxybutyric derivatives are convenient as with these compounds hydrolysis and removal of the R: group in vivo leaves a reactive terminal radical which will tend to cyclize and prompt the effective release of the mother compound. Similarly, linkers of the formula Ls:<br><br><br>
are convenient as enzymatic or spontaneous hydrolysis of a first of the R: groups will result in an active terminus able to curl back and attack the acyl linkage to the mother compound thus promoting spontaneous release of the linker fragment. Other convenient linkers along the same principle have the formula L3, or L3:<br><br>

The invention is applicable to L and D- nucleosides beanng di, tn and tetrahydric (that is beanng 2, 3 or 4 hydroxy groups on the (pseudo)saccharide, such as those of the formula N-3:<br><br><br><br>
where	B is a natural or unnatural nucleotide base,<br>
RNI is O or -CH,-, S<br>
RN: and RN3 are each H or RN2 is methylene or -CH(OH)- and RN5 is a bond thereto, or RN2 and RN5 together are a bond; n is 0 or 1;<br>
one of RN3 and RNi comprises a liaker-R: structure such as those of formulae Ilaa, Il'aa, lIc', He', IIP, id' and the other is hydrogen or a further linker-R2 structure.<br>
An alternative group drugs to which the invention is applicable includes those of formula N-3 a:<br><br><br>
N-3a<br><br>
where B, NR3 and NR4 are as defined above.<br>
Preferably the linker(R2')k-R, structure is estenfied to R3 in the above two structures, that is the nominal 5' hydroxy group of the nucleoside analogue.<br>
An alternative group of drugs within the scope of the invention has the formula N-3b:<br><br><br>
NR3—O<br>
NR4<br><br>
N-3b<br><br>
where B, RN3and RN4 are as defined above and RN6 is fluoro and RN7 is hydrogen or RN6 and RN7 are both fluoro or RN6 and RN7 together define an exo-methenyl group. The preferred base is guanine in this alternative.<br>
A further group of nucleosides within the scope of the invention has the formula N-3c<br><br>
RN3 —O-<br>
RN4<br><br>
RN9<br><br>
N-3c<br><br>
where B, RN3 and RN4 are as defined above, RN8 and RN9 are fluoro (or one of them is fluoro and the other is hydrogen) or RN8 and RN9 together define exomethenyl or exomethenyl mono or di-subsituted with fluoro. These nucleosides have anticancer activity.<br>
The invention is also applicable to other nucleosides having at least two hydroxy groups, but outside the scope of formula N-3a-c. for instance, 9-[3,3-<br>
d]hydroxyrnethyl-4-hydroxy-but-]-yl]guanine as described in WO 95/22330 and 9-<br><br>
[4-hydroxy-(2-hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine as described in EP 343 133. The invention is applicable to both L and D stereo forms of the various nucleoside analogues<br>
The compounds of the invention, especially cytosine or guanine derivatives where NR] is oxygen, n is 1 and NR2 and NR5 define a ring are also active against certain retroviral infections, notably SIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and Hepatitis B virus. The compounds of the invention, especially cytosme, guanosine or 6-meihoxyguanosine derivatives wherein NR] is oxygen, n is 0 and NR2 and NR5 define an arabinose ring are potent anticancer compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention, especially derivatives comprising a 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide base, where NR1 is O, NR2 is -CH(OH)-, NR3 is a bond thereto and n is 0 (ribavirin) are expected to be active against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Compounds comprising a substituted benzimidazole base, where NR] is O, NR2 is -CH(OH)-, NR5 is a bond thereto and n is 0 (for instance Glaxo Wellcome's 1263W94 where the base is 2-isopropylamin-5,6-dichloro-benzimidazol-3-yl) are expected to be active against CMV. Compounds comprising an adenine base, where NR1 is O, NR2 is -CH(OH)-, NR5 is a bond thereto and n is 0 (vidarabine) are expected to be active against HSV encephalitis. Compounds comprising a 2-chloroadenine base with a 2'-deoxyribose sugar are expected to have anticancer activity.<br>
The nucleoside derivatives of the invention are particularly useful for guanine nucleoside and analogues which tend to have poorer uptake than pynmidine nucleosides. Accordingly B is preferably guanine or a guanine derivative.<br>
A group of hydroxy beanng drugs which are particularly amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are the ring hydroxy compounds. By ring hydroxy is meant that the hydroxy function to which the prodrug of the invention is bound is bonded directly onto an aromatic or non-aromatic, heterocyclic or carbocychc ring structure.<br><br>
Examples of ring hydroxy compounds include the cyclic urea HIV protease inhibitors, such as those described in WO 9843969, WO9820008, and WO 9419329. Representative protease inhibitors include.<br><br>
where Rl is NH, (DMP 450) or	                     (SD 146).<br><br>
Some examples of phenolic ring hydroxy compounds include the PETT NNRT1 discussed below or the compound described in J Med Chem 35 3467 (1992):<br><br>
OH<br><br>
OH     O<br>
Pancratistatin descnbed in Anticancer Drug Design 10: 243 &amp; 299 (1995) and Bioorg Med Chem Lett 6 157 1996:<br><br>
has both phenolicand carbocyclic ring hydroxy functions. A further useful drug with a combination of phenolic and carbocyclic hydroxy functions is etoposide:<br><br><br><br>
as described in Bioorg Med Chem Leu 4 2567 (1994) and Clinical Cancer Res 1 105<br>
1995.<br>
A further convenient Drug for appying the prodrugs of the invention is the anti¬parkinsonian agent levodopa:<br>
O<br><br>
This drug has four accessible functions for applying the prodrugs of the invention, namely the 3 and 4 hydroxy groups on the phenyl and the amino and carboxy functions on the side chain.<br>
A structure of the formula 11a or II-b can be esterified to one or both of the aromatic hydroxy! functions or amide-bonded to the levodopa ammo function. A trifunctiona] linker of Formula III or Formula lid, can be carbonyl bonded to the levodopa carboxy] function. Such "blocked" carboxyl levodopa compounds are conceivably less susceptible to in vivo peripheral decarboxylation than levodopa and may thus allow the diminution or omission of the customarily coadministered decarboxylase inhibitors such as carbidopa.<br><br>
A further convenient Drug for applying the prodrugs of the invention is chromoglycate, also known as cromolyn, useful in the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, mastocytosis, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease:<br><br><br><br>
It will be apparent that cromolyn has three accessible functions suitable for applying the prodrugs of the invention. In particular, a linker of the formula IId can be carbonyl linked to either of the carboxy groups. As cromolyn is a symmetric compound it may be advantageous to bond a respective linker to each of the carboxyl groups. Alternatively or additionally, a linker of the formula IIa, lId, such as those wherein T is a bond or -O- and V isa bond can be esterified to the hydroxy group depending from the propylene bridge, optionally in conjunction with conventional pharmaceutical esters on the carboxy groups.<br><br>
A further group of Drugs which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are the<br>
pain-killer opiates such as morphine:<br>
OH<br>
H3C-N<br>
Morphine and many of its analogues have a pair of hydroxy functions accessible to the prodrug approach of the invention. For instance a structure of formula IIa wherein T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond would be convenient for estenfication with the 3 and/or 6 hydroxy groups.<br><br>
A further convenient group of compounds include the macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and roxitromycin and antibacterial glycopeptides such as vancomycin.<br>
A further convenient group of Drugs for applying*the prodrugs of the invention are the rifamycin antibiotics:<br><br><br><br>
wherein the asterisks define the requisite number of aromatic bonds, including rifampicin (R2, is OH, R,, is -CH=N-(4-N-methylpiperazine), Rc is hydroxy),-nfamide (R, is OCH2CONH(C2H5)2, Rb is hydrogen, Rc is hydroxy), rifamycin B (R, is -OCH2COOH, Rb is hydrogen, Rc is hydroxy), rifamycin O (R, is -l,3-dioxolan-4-on)-2-yl, Rb is hydrogen, Rc is hydroxy), rifamycin S (R, is =O, Rb is hydrogen. Rt is =O), rifamycin SV (Ra is -OH, Rb is hydrogen Rc is -OH), rifaximin (R3 and Rb together define a structure:<br><br>
, R5 is hydroxy), and nfabutinum (Ra and R3 together define a structure:<br><br>
. R1 is =0).<br>
It will be apparent that the rifamvcms have a number of free hydroxyls and secondary amines available for estenficalion or amide bonding with respective linker-R2 groups<br><br>
    in accordance with the invention such as those of Formula Ila above, which linker group is bonded to one of said hydroxy or amino groups.<br>

Common for the above cephalosporins is the presence of a carboxy group at the 2-position which is amenable to derivation with a linker group, in particular those of the Formula lid defined above. The above listed Ra, Rb and Rc groups may also be combined in various permutations and the invention includes prodrugs of all such cephalosporins.<br>
A further group of Drugs which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are the anticholinesterases such as tacrine:<br><br>
where R is H or OH. It will be apparent that the tacrine itself (R=H) has a free amine group suitable for denvatisation with a linker-R2, group such as those of Formula lla, for instance when T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond. The tacrine metabolite (R = OH), which is also active in vivo has an additional hydroxy function which can alternatively or additionally be derivatised with a linker such as those of Formula lla, for instance when T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond.<br>
A further group of Drugs which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are the sulphonamide diuretics such as furosemide:<br><br><br>
h will be apparent that furosemide has a free carboxylic function, a primary amine and a secondary amine amenable !o the prodrugs of the invention. In particular an R2 bearing linker, such as those of Formula III, or Formula IId can be carbonyl linked to the free carboxy function. Alternatively or additionally, an R: bearing linker, such as those of Formula Ila, for instance where T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond can be amide bonded to the primary and/or secondary amine groups.<br>
A further group of Drugs amenable to the prodrugs of the invention include the α-1 and P-blocker carvedilol compounds:<br><br>
Carvedilol has a free hydroxy function, a secondary heterocyclic amine and a further secondary amine on the side chain, which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention, such as those of Formula IIa, for instance where T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond which is in turn linked to the hydroxy and/or the ring amine and/or the side chain amine functions on carvedilol.<br>
A further group of Drugs which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are the hypolipaemic statins, such as flustatin or compounds of the formula:<br><br><br>
Re Rd<br>
such as pravastatin (Ra = H, Rb = OH, Re = H . Rd = OH) and simvastatin.(Ra = CH3, Rb = CH„ Re and Rd together define a bond).<br>
Taking simvastatin as an example, it will be apparent thai there is a free side chain hydroxyl which is available for linkage with an R: bearing linker, such as those of Formula Ila, for instance where T is a bond or -O- and V is a bond.<br>
The statin pravastatin also bears a corresponding hydroxy function and can be derivatised with a linker in the same fashion. Pravastatin also bears a ring hydroxyl and a further side chain hydroxyl function which can be derivatised with a linker in a corresponding fashion. Pravastatin also bears a carboxyl function which can additionally or alternatively be derivatised with an R2 bearing linker such as those of Formula III, or Formula IId.<br>
A further group of Drugs which are amenable to the prodrugs of the invention are peptides and pseudopeptides such protease inhibitors including antifibrinolytics like aprotinin or peptidomimetic aspartyl protease inhibitors such as renin inhibitors. Other peptide Drugs include hormones such as vasopressins. Taking vasopressins as an example, peptide Drugs may be cyclic oligopeptides consisting solely of amino acids such as desmopressin or oxytocin, wherein the N and C terminals represent accessible functions for derivatisation in accordance with the invention. Additionally many peptide drugs include amino acids with side chains bearing accessible functions such as arginine, serine or aspartate. Alternatively a peptide Drug, particularly peptidomimetics can be derivatised with non-amino acid structures bearine accessible functions such as somatostatin octreotide.<br><br>
Useful oligopeptides for derivisation acording to the invention include MK 383, an Arg-Gly-Asp analogue useful as an antithrombotic, DADLE (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-D-Leu), an encephalin analogue and N1SIN.<br>

It will be appreciated that the NNRTI mother compound in formulae P-3-8' has been shown as an example of a phenolic hydroxy and that the respective prodrug moiety will be applicable to otther ring hydroxy functions of a drug, particularly those subject to electron withdrawing effects. Compounds of this phenolic hydroxy aspect of the invention are typically prepared by alkylation of the corresponding mother compounds. In particular, the preparation of compounds of formula P-3 or P-4 generally proceeds by alkylation using conventional coupling conditions of the mother compound with the corresponding intermediate:<br><br><br><br>
where Rx and L are as defined above and R2* is R2 as defined, but N-protected with a conventional N-protectmg group. Preferably the halogen activating group is iodo, which is in turn prepared by iodination of ihe corresponding chloro analogue. Typical coupling conditions include treatment with a base in an organic solvent such as THF pnor to addition of the halogenaied intermediate followed by  conventional deprotection of the R3 N-proiecting group.<br>

The pharmaceutical compounds of the invention are generally prepared by alkylation or acylation of the respective mother compounds. Alkylation or acylation generally proceeds via,an activated derivative. The activated derivative used in an acylation may comprise e.g, the acid halide, acid anhydride, activated acid ester or the acid in the presence of coupling reagent, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, where<br>

The reactive derivatives of the X-linker(N-PG-R2')-N-PG-R2 intermediates implied above may be pre-formed or generated in situ by the use of reagents * such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or O-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl) N,N,N\N,-tetramethyluronium'tetrafluoroborate(TBTU). When an acid halide, such as the acid chloride is used, a tertiaryamine catalyst, such as triethylamine, N,N'-dimethylaniline, pyridinebrdimemylariiihopyndine may be added to the reaction mixture to bind the liberated hydrohalicacid.'        <br><br><br>
The reacnons are preferably earned out in an unreactive solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran. dioxane, acetonitnle or a halogenatated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane. If desired, any of the above mentioned tertiary amine catalysts may be used as solvent, taking care that a suitable excess is present. The reaction temperature can typically be vaned between 0° C and 60° C, but will preferably be kept between 5° and 50° C. After a period of 1 to 60 hours the reaction will usually be essentially complete. The progress of the reaction can be followed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and appropriate solvent systems. In general, when the reaction is completed as determined by TLC, the product is extracted with an organic solvent and punfied by chromatography and/or recrystaliisation from an appropriate solvent system.<br>
By-products where acylation has taken place on inappropriate places on the Drug can be separated by chromatography, but such misacylation can be minimized by controlled reaction conditions. These controlled conditions can be achieved, for example, by manipulating the reagent concentrations or rate of addition, especially of the acylating agent, by lowering the temperature or by the choice of solvent. The reaction can be followed by TLC to monitor the controlled conditions..<br>
Linkers of Formula Ha may alternatively be amide bonded to free primary or secondary amine functions on the Drug using conventional chemistry in the peptide art.<br>
Linkers of Formula Ilia or IVd or the corresponding derivatives of Formula III' and H'd will generally be acylated to free carboxyl functions on the Drug in an analogous, but reversed fashion to the above described acylation of Drugs with hydroxy functions. US 4 486 425 which is incorporated by reference illustrates a convenient process.<br><br>
Linkers of Formula IVa wherein V comprises a structure of the formula Ilcc can be prepared by a by a two stage process. In particular a compound of the formula C1C(=0)0C(RJ(R4,)C1 can be reacted with a suitable accessible hydroxy function on the Drug (optionally protected on other functions with conventional protecting groups) as is known in the cephalosporin art. The resulting Drug-O-C(=O)OC(R.)(RJ')chlonde is then reacted with an R: bearing linker wherein a free function comprises a carboxyl function, such as the potassium salt.<br>
Intermediates of the formula IId are conveniently prepared by acylation of a carboxy-protecied hydroxy alkanoic acid, typically a 2-hydroxy-l-alkanoic acid, with the appropriate activated and N-protected R: derivative, such as N-CBZ valyl or isoleucyl in conjunction with a conventional coupling reagent such as DMAP/DCC or with the amino acid halide. The carboxy protecting group is then removed, for instance by acid hydrolysis and the resulting intermediate is activated as described above or the free acid is unsed in conjunction with a coupling reagent to esterify the the nucleoside under conventional esterification conditions.<br>
Compounds within the scope of the invention are also conveniently prepared by the methodology in the immediately preceding paragraph, namely esterification of a carboxy protected a- hydroxy, co-carboxy acid, such as glycollic acid, lactic acid, hydroxybutyric acid etc with the appropriate N-protected R, derivative, either as the free acid in conjunction with a coupling agent or activated, for instance to the corresponding acid halide. The carboxy protecting group is removed and the resulting intermediate esterified with the nucleoside with the methodology described above.<br>
Compounds comprising a structure of the formula IIc or II fare prepared by carboxy protecting the terminal carboxy groups of the respective dicarboxylic acid, such as L-tartaric acid or L-malic acid, with conventional carboxy protecting groups such as benzyl. The free hydroxy group (s) are then esterified with conventional esterification techniques, such as DMAP &amp; DCC in DMF with the appropnate N-protected R, amino acid, such as N-Boc-L-valyl or N-Boc-L-isoleucyl. The benzyl carboxy protecting groups are removed and the resulting product is esterified to the 5'-<br><br>
hydroxy function of a monohydric nucleoside, using conventional conditions, such as those in the accompanying Examples. Finally, the free carboxy function is esterified with an R, group or, more preferbably a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable ester, such as the ethyl ester.<br>
Tnfunctional of formula Ha wherein and n and m are 1 and Alk is absent can be prepared from glycerol by regioselective estenfication as described in PCT/SE9S/01467. In short R: and R2' are regioselectively estenfied 10 positions 1 and 3 of the glycerol and position 2 is then converted to the appropriate -T-C(=0)-group, which is then estenfied to an accessible function on the Drug, or alternatively to a cooperating function on an intermediate linker, such as succinic acid which is in tum linked to the accessible funciton on the Drug. Glycerol based linkers where T comprises an -NH- group can be prepared by analogous regioselective esterification followed by conversion of the free hydroxyl to amine, reduction to azide and reaction with phosgene to form the corresponding chlorocarbamate.<br>
Linkers where m and n are 1, Alk is alkylene or alkenylene and T is a bond can be prepared analagously to the methodology in PCT/SE98/01467. Other permutations of m, n, Alk and the various functions in the tnfunctional linker group L, of formula Ha can be prepared analagously to the above with the corresponding starter materials, such as 1,2,4-trihydroxybutane (CA registry number 3968-00-6), 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid (1518-61-2 &amp;. 22329-74-4), (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid (51267-44-8), (R)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid (158800-76-1), 1,2,5-pentanetriol (51064-73-4 &amp; 14697-46-2), (S)-l,2,5-pentanetnol (13942-73-9), (R)-1,2,5-pentanetno!

or can be reacted with an hydroxy group of the Drug (optionally protected on the other vulnerable functional groups with conventional protecting groups). The resulting drug-0-C(=O)OC(R4)(R4')chloride is then reacted with an N-protected-R7 or a di or tri tnfunctiona] linker beanng an N-protected R: in which the third function compnses a carboxyl function<br>
The amino acid derivative of R: and, if present, R, can alternatively be esterified to the linker group with the 2-oxa-4-aza-cycloalkane-l,3-dione methodology descnbed in international patent application no. WO 94/29311, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Linking of the carboxy function of R: to an amine group on the linker derivative proceeds by conventional peptide chemistry, generally in conjunction with protection of the a-amine with conventional N-protecting groups. Formation of an amide bond between a carboxyl function on the linker and the a-amine group of R-, also proceeds by conventional peptide chemistry, generally in conjunction with protection of the a-carboxy function.<br>
The preparation of further linker groups and their application to Drugs is shown in the following Examples.<br>

While it is possible for the active agent to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as part of a pharmaceutical formulation. Such a formulation will comprise the above defined active agent together with one or more acceptable carners/excipients and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The camer(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration, but preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in<br><br>
unit dosage form, e.g. tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the above defined active agent with the earner. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid earners or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for prepanng a pharmaceutical composition comprising bnngmg a pharmaceutical compound of the invention or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically acceptable earner or vehicle. If the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations involves intimate mixing of pharmaceutical excipients and the active ingredient in salt form, then it is often preferred to use excipients which are non-basic in nature, i.e. either acidic or neutral.<br>
Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion and as a bolus etc.<br>

Biological Example 1 Pharmacokinetics<br>
Confirmation that orally administered prodrugs as envisaged by the invention release the respective mother compound in vivo is obtained in a rat model which is<br>
..recognized,as,.a useful model for assessing pharmacokinetic parameters vehicle analogues- The oral compositions are administered in, a pharmaceutical vehicle<br>
comprising propyene glycol , or in the case of the more soluble compounds such as<br>
:<br>
 that ofExampie 26 or Example 34, in.water/tb duplicate fasted animals in.a dosage<br><br>
corresponding to 0 1 mmol/kg. For comparison, a set of rats is iv dosed with 0.01 mmol/kg of the metabolite 2',3'-dideoxy-3,-fluoroguanosine. Serum levels of the metabolite are then monitored in serum collected at intervals from individual animals from 0.5 to up to 12 hours following administration (5 min to 6 hours for FLG).<br>
The metabolite is analysed with HPLC with UV detection at 254 ran, in a manner analogous to Stahle et al 1995, J Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 13, 369-376. An HPLC system can be based on a 0.05 M ammonium-dihydrogen-phosphate buffer, with 1.2 % 2-propanol solvent, buffered to pH 4.5 or 30 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer with 2% acetonitrile solvent buffered to pH 7.0. The column may be a 100 x 2.1 mm BAS CI8 5 pm particle size with a 7 pm CI 8 guard column or Zorbax SB-CN C18 150x4.6mm, 5pm column. Protein binding of the compounds of the invention is neglible as is that of the metabolite and ultrafiltration through Amicon or Microcon 30 filters is useful for serum samples. Advantageously the main peak is subject to further column chromatography to better aid in resolution of FLG over low weight serum components. The iv levels are multiplied by a factor often in order to obtain AUC values for comparison with the oral values. Absolute oral bioavailability is determined as the ratio between °""AUCjv and """AlICoral<br>

The compounds of the invention thus provide significantly enhanced oral bioavailability relative to the active metabolite 2',3'-dideoxy-3,-fluoroguanosine. Notably, the compounds are released into the blood in a relatively sustained manner, rather than in an immediate peak. This means that effective amounts of the active metabolite are available in the blood for many hours assisting once daily dosage. Additionally, a sustained release avoids the problems of acute toxicity seen in compounds with a more rapid release rate.<br>
Although the rat is well recognized as a good model for predicting human bioavailability of nuceoside analogues, species independent bioavailability of a 5'-0-3-[ 1.3-bis-(L-valyloxy)-2-propyloxycarbonyl propanoyl]FLG was confirmed in = 11.5 kg male and female beagle dogs administered orally with 0.05 mmol/kg (38 mg/kg) compound in water or iv 0.005 mmol/kg (1.35 mg/kg) metabolite in water. Plasma collection and analysis as above.<br>

Female dog   12 hour absolute bioavailability	74%<br>
Biological Example 2 Bioavailability<br>
The release of the phenolic mother compound from a prodrug of the invention were monitored in rats. The compounds of Examples PI-4, 6&amp;7 were made up in a propylene glycol vehicle and orally administered to paired fasted male Sprague Dawley rats at a dose corresponding to 0.027 mmol/kg. At 30, 60, 120, 240 &amp; 360 minutes, 0.2 ml blood were collected, centnfuged and frozen for later analysis. The released phenolic drug, (IS, 2S)-N-[c/5-2-(6 -fluoro-2-hydroxy-3-propionylphenyl) cyclopropyl]-N,-[2-(5-cyanop&gt;'ridyl)] urea was assayed by HPLC. Aliquots comprising 40-100 u.1 of each plasma sample are mixed with an equal volume of<br><br>
acetonitnie (10 seconds, Vibrofex). The sample is centrifuged (2 min, 14000 RPM] and 30 ul of the supernatant is injected into an HPLC system, as follows.<br><br>

Biological Example 3<br>
Bioavailability of the ring indanolic ring hydroxy compound of Example B-1 was assessed in rats by the procedure of Biological Example 2 also using a propylene glycol vehicle, 58mg/kg (0.047 mmol/kg), but wherein the mother compound Nl, N6-di [(lS,2R)-2-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-l-H-l-indenyl]-(2R, 3R, 5R)-2,5-di(benzyloxy)-3,4-dihydroxyhexanediamide was assayed by LC-MS using SiM (single ion monitonng) with M/Z ion detector 653. Plasma results are presented as uM in the table below:<br><br>
