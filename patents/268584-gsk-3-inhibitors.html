GSK-3 INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to enzyme inhibitors, and more particularly to urea<br>
derivatives as inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3(3, GSK-3, to processes of<br>
preparation of such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and<br>
to their use for the treatment and or prophylaxis of a disease in which GSK-3 is<br>
involved, such as Alzheimer's disease or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by<br>
better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with<br>
target diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive<br>
study is the protein kinases. Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular<br>
responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include<br>
autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative<br>
diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease or<br>
hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal<br>
chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
comprised of a and Î² isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes (Coghlan et al.,<br>
Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics<br>
Dev., 10, 508-514 (2000)). The threonine/serine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3<br>
(GSK-3) fulfills a pivotal role in various receptor-linked signalling pathways (Doble,<br>
BW, Woodgett, JR J.Cell Sci. 2003, 116:1175-1186). Dysregulation within these<br>
pathways is considered a crucial event in the development of several prevalent human<br>
disorders, such as type II diabetes (Kaidanovich O, Eldar-Finkelman H, Expert Opin.<br>
Ther. Targets, 2002, 6:555-561), Alzheimer's disease (Grimes CA, Jope RS,<br>
Prog.Neurobiol. 2001, 65:391-426) , CNS disorders such as manic depressive disorder<br>
and neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders (Hoeflich KP, Luo<br><br>
WO 2007/017145	PCT/EP2006/007520<br>
2<br>
J, Rubie EA, Tsao MS, Jin O, Woodgett J, Nature 2000, 406:86-90). These diseases<br>
may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal operation of certain cell signalling<br>
pathways in which GSK-3 plays a role.<br>
GSK-3 has been found to phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number<br>
of regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen synthase which is the rate<br>
limiting enzyme necessary for glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor P-catenin, the translation initiation factor elF2B, as<br>
well as ATP citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc, c-Myb, CREB, and<br>
CEPBa. These diverse protein targets implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular<br>
metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
Currently, inhibition of GSK-3 may represent a viable strategy to develop novel<br>
medicinal entities for the treatment of such unmet diseases (Martinez A, Castro A,<br>
Dorronsoro 1, Alonso M, Med. Res. Rev., 2002, 22:373-384) through insulin mimicry,<br>
tau dephosphorylation and amyloid processing, or transcriptional modulation<br>
respectively.<br>
In the State of the Art, some compounds containing an urea group have already<br>
been described as having GSK-3 inhibitory properties. This is the case, for example, of<br>
publications WO03/004472, WO03/004475 and WO03/089419. These publications<br>
refer each one to a very broad number of compounds defined by a Markush structure,<br>
said structure being big and complex, this circumstance making their preparation more<br>
complicated and increasing the probability of reactivity of the compounds. Particularly,<br>
these compounds pertain to structural subgroups such as substituted thiazole compounds<br>
and heterocyclic amines. These compounds may contain, among many other groups, an<br>
urea functional group. These compounds are generally said to have inhibitory effects on<br>
GSK-3, and thus potential activity in the treatment and prevention of a series of diseases<br>
related to GSK-3, such as dementias, diabetes and mood disorders. Nevertheless, no<br>
results regarding GSK-3 inhibition for any particular compounds are included in any of<br>
the above-mentioned publications; that is, neither for those comprising an urea<br>
functional group any results really proving any activity of these urea derivatives are<br>
shown.<br><br>
WO 2007/017145	PCT/EP2006/007520<br>
3<br>
On the other hand, Publication WO03/004478 and article "Structural Insights<br>
and Biological Effects of GSK-3 specific Inhibitor AR-A014418", J. Biol. Chem., 278<br>
(46), 2003 deal with one particular urea, 4-(4-methoxybenzyl)-N'-(5-nitro-l,3-thiazo!-<br>
2-yl)urea; this urea indeed has a much smaller and simpler structure than the above<br>
mentioned ureas. It is described as having GSK-3 inhibitory properties, and thus as<br>
having potential activity for treating and/or preventing numerous conditions associated<br>
with glycogen synthase kinase 3. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the GSK-3<br>
inhibitory effect is due to the urea itself or to the nitro-thiazole, as heterocyclic<br>
compounds have been described as having GSK-3 inhibitory properties, see for example<br>
above-mentioned WO03/089419.<br>
Some other ureas have been described in relation to the treatment of<br>
neurological disorders, but in relation with completely different methods of action, for<br>
example WO00/06156, wherein the disclosed ureas are described to be potentiators of<br>
glutamate receptor function.<br>
There is therefore still a need to find good GSK-3 inhibitors, being both<br>
effective and selective, and having good "drugability:' properties, i.e. good<br>
pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and<br>
excretion. An additional advantage would be to find compounds with simple, stable<br>
structures, being easy to be prepared by ordinary proceedings known to the skilled<br>
person.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that a group of stable and small urea derivatives shows<br>
inhibitory effects on GSK-3 enzyme.<br>

other.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the compounds of the invention are also meant to<br>
include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically<br>
enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the<br>
replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by<br>
a I3C- or l4C-enriched carbon or 15N-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, solvates, prodrugs"<br>
refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, or any other compound<br>
which, upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or<br><br>
WO 2007/017145	PCT/EP2006/007520<br>
13<br>
indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those<br>
may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation<br>
of salts, prodrugs and derivatives can be carried out by methods known in the art.<br>
For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein<br>
are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by<br>
conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by<br>
reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of<br>
the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two.<br>
Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or<br>
acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid<br>
addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide,<br>
sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example,<br>
acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, maiate, mandelate,<br>
methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts<br>
include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium,<br>
magnesium, aluminium and lithium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example,<br>
ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine,<br>
glucamine and basic aminoacids salts.<br>
Particularly favoured derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the<br>
bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are<br>
administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more<br>
readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a<br>
biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent<br>
species.<br>
Any compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula (I) is within the<br>
scope of the invention. The term "prodrug" is used in its broadest sense and<br>
encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the<br>
invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include,<br>
depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the<br><br>
WO 2007/017145	PCT/EP2006/007520<br>
14<br>
following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate<br>
esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known<br>
methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled<br>
in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. "Textbook of Drugdesign<br>
and Discovery" Taylor &amp; Francis (April 2002).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free<br>
compounds or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) and it is intended that both forms are within<br>
the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the<br>
art. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates. In a particular<br>
embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
form is meant, inter alia, having a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding<br>
normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material<br>
considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are<br>
preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%, most preferably above 90%. In a<br>
preferred embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of formula (I), or of its salts,<br>
solvates or prodrugs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by the above described<br>
formula (1) may include enantiomers depending on the presence of chiral centres or<br>
isomers depending on the presence of multiple bonds (e.g. Z, E). The single isomers,<br>
enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) defined above can be obtained by available<br>
synthetic procedures, for example by reacting:<br><br><br>
in a suitable solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane,<br>
dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature within the range of+20 to +150Â°C.<br>
One preferred pharmaceutically acceptable form is the crystalline form,<br>
including such form in a pharmaceutical composition. In the case of salts and solvates<br>
the additional ionic and solvent moieties must also be non-toxic. The compounds of the<br>
invention may present different polymorphic forms, it is intended that the invention<br>
encompasses all such forms.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, pills,<br>
capsules, granules etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) composition for<br>
oral, topical or parenteral administration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions are in oral form.<br>
Suitable dose forms for oral administration may be tablets and capsules and may contain<br>
conventional excipients known in the art such as binding agents, for example syrup,<br>
acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example<br>
lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting<br>
lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycolate or microcrystalline cellulose; or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of<br>
blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute<br>
the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers.<br>
Such operations are conventional in the art. The tablets may for example be prepared by<br>
wet or dry granulation and optionally coated according to methods well known in<br>
normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.<br><br>
WO 2007/017145	PCT/EP2006/007520<br>
16<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be adapted for parenteral<br>
administration, such as sterile solutions, suspensions or lyophilized products in the<br>
appropriate unit dosage form. Adequate excipients can be used, such as bulking agents,<br>
buffering agents or surfactants.<br>
The mentioned formulations will be prepared using standard methods such as<br>
those described or referred to in the Spanish and US Pharmacopoeias and similar<br>
reference texts.<br>
Administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention may<br>
be by any suitable method, such as intravenous infusion, oral preparations, and<br>
intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. Oral administration is preferred because<br>
of the convenience for the patient and the chronic character of many of the diseases to<br>
be treated.<br>
Generally an effective administered amount of a compound of the invention will<br>
depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder<br>
being treated and the weight of the sufferer. However, active compounds will typically<br>
be administered once or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with<br>
typical total daily doses in the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compounds and compositions of this invention may be used with other<br>
drugs to provide a combination therapy. The other drugs may form part of the same<br>
composition, or be provided as a separate composition for administration at the same<br>
time or at different time.<br>
In the following, the present invention is further illustrated by examples. They<br>
should in no case be interpreted as a limitation of the scope of the invention as defined<br>
in the claims.<br><br>
