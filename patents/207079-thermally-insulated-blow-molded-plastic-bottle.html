COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SEE SEC. 10; RULE 13)<br>
" Thermally insulated blow molded plastic bottle<br>
SHAH(SAVLA)Dhirajlal Premji 31A Ganesh Prasad, 4th floor, 10 Noushir Bharucha Marg, Mumbai- 400,007, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be perfomed :<br><br><br>
This invention relates to " Thermally insulated blow molded plastic bottle and method of manufacturing such bottle."<br>
More particularly this invention relates to thermally insulated 'one use throw away type' blow molded plastic bottle and closure cap with or without option to have pilfer evident sealing band of the type described herein for use in filling heat sensitive products and method of manufacturing such bottle.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Use of blow moulded plastic bottles with or without pilfer evident sealing band are known and used all over the country by manufacturers for filling sterilized potable water, filling cough mixture, milk products and other food products having low melting point such as ghee, chocolates and the like products. The vacuum sealed bottles known by their generic term 'Thermos flasks" are known and used wherever the liquid is required to be maintained at hot or cold temperature.   But this is found to be expensive and not viable for use as one use throwaway type packaging material. Both these do not offer any solution to the problems faced by the pharmaceutical, processed drinking water and   food      processing   industry,   with   cost   effectiveness   and convenient to  use  on  online  automatic  packing  (filling)  line<br><br><br>
compared to glass container of    semi-automatic process with inherent variation.<br>
Alternate packing method is to fill the product in glass bottles as packaging material, but glass being breakable, thicker glass bottle is used, which increases costs of manufacture, transportation and risk of breakages during handling and transportation. Again minimum number of glass bottles is to be ordered for manufacturing which is quite large. All these problems are present in today's time for the above industries.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to offer low cost thermally insulated jacketed plastic bottle which can be manufactured by any person skilled in the art and offered to the above stated industries at affordable price. There are no such thermally insulated blow moulded jacketed bottle with or without pilfer evident tearable sealing band produced or used anywhere.<br>
Another object of this invention is to offer thermally insulated jacketed bottle of the type herein described capable of increasing shelf life more than what is presently offered by the industry and in which the air entrapped within the hollow space between two bottles forms thermal insulation and air cushion for the products packed in inner of said jacketed bottle.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
With these objects in view according to this invention thermally<br><br><br>
insulated blow molded jacketed plastic bottle with or without pilfer evident tear able sealing band comprising a tubular bottle having means for fixing a closure hot pressed into a rotund bottle to form an air tight container and the air entrapped in the void between two bottles forms thermal insulation for the product packed in said jacketed bottle which, at the option of the industry when closed by a screw cap or having perforated tearable sealing band such that the contents of said bottle become accessible only after breaking said sealing band and said screw cap thereafter can only be used as ordinary screw cap and wherein said pot bellied bottle is provided with undersized neck ring than the diameter said tubular bottle such that said neck ring to expand when tubular bottle is slid into said pot bellied bottle and which on cooling down to ambient temperature attains stable dimensions and forms an unitary airtight bottle..<br>
The following nomenclature represents like parts throughout this specification:<br>
1	Hermitically insulated assembled jacketed bottle<br>
2	Tubular bottle 2A    Screw threads<br>
2B    Notch below screw threads 2A<br>
2C    Lock ring separating lock ring and flange 2E<br>
2D    Collar around ramp 2E<br>
2E    Ramp<br><br><br>
2F    Stud on base 2G of tubular bottle 2<br>
2G    base of bottle 2 having integrally attached stud 2F<br>
3      rotund or like belly shaped bottle shell<br>
3A    collar around mouth of bottle 3 3B    socket on<br>
3C    air pocket within the bottle 3 forming thermal<br>
insulation for the contents in bottle 2 3D    base of bottle 3<br>
4	screw cap with or without pilfer-evident<br>
4A    screw threads on cap 4 matching with screw threads<br>
2A on jacketed bottle 1 4B    tear able sealing band (Optional. Not shown in drawing) AC    tab on sealing band 4 for tearing apart said sealing band<br>
(Optional. Not shown in the drawing) 4D    cork or plastic liner in closure cap 4<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 - shows part sectional elevation of tubular bottle; Fig.2-  shows  a  part  sectional  elevation  of pot  bellied<br>
bottle Fig.3 - shows a part sectional elevation of closure, and Fig.4 â€”shows a part sectional elevation of jacketed bottle<br><br><br>
assembly fitted with closure cap without sealing band.<br>
According to this invention a thermally insulated blow molded jacketed plastic bottle 1 (Fig. 4) with or without a pilfer evident tear able sealing band 4B having a tab 4C (Fig.3) at one end comprising a tubular or any geometrical shaped bottle 2 hot pressed into a pot bellied or rotund bottle 3 thereby matching collar 2D on ramp 2E with collar 3A around mouth of bottle 3 (Fig.3) and forms an air tight bottle 1 and the air entrapped in cavity 3C forms thermal insulation for the contents packed in said bottle 1. Said bottle 1, when closed at the option of the user industry, with a screw cap or a pilfer evident tear able sealing band 4B with a tab 4C on one side, the contents of said bottle 1 are accessible only when said sealing band is torn open and thereafter said cover can only be used as an ordinary screw cap. Tubular bottle 2 and the opening formed in said pot bellied bottle 3 may have provided with matching geometrical shape such that the two complement with each other and form rigid thermally insulated unitary bottle.<br>
The following is the method of manufacturing thermally insulated bottle or like container :<br><br><br>
The tubular or any other geometrical shaped bottle 2 and the pot bellied bottle shell 3 having a matching geometrical shaped opening are either blow molded together or separately and bottle 3 as it comes out of the blowing machine is hot and bottle 2 is pressed into said bottle shell 3 so that the mating faces on respective bottles get properly fitted and which on cooling down to ambient temperature shrink and attain stable dimensions. Likewise a closure cap 4 is molded with or without a perforated tear able sealing band 4B slides over lock ring 2D on said tubular bottle 2 and forms pilfer evident sealed bottle 1 thereafter the packed product of said bottle 2 can only be accessed when said sealing band is torn and separated from the closure cap 4 thus it guarantees that the product packed in said bottle 2 has not been tampered with since leaving the fact<br>
According to this invention the product packing inner capacity and the outer dimensions remains same as conventional glass bottle. According to one modification the volume of outer bottle shell may vary depending on the specification laid by the industry while the volume of the inner bottle remains constant. Likewise the volume of said tubular bottle remains the same as that of conventional glass bottle<br><br><br>
