				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The<br>
invention relates to a linear actuator of the type defined in the introductory<br>
portion of claim 1.<br>
A quick release unit in an actuator is used for temporarily interrupting the<br>
connection to the inert part of the transmission and the motor so that the<br>
activating element may be adjusted manually. As an example of where a<br>
quick release unit is used, reference may be made to hospital beds, patient<br>
lifters, emergency exits or fire doors and other structures where it is important,<br>
if not vital, to be able to make a spontaneous adjustment of the activating<br>
element.<br>
Actuators having a quick release function are known inter alia from EP 685<br>
662 B1 and WO 03/033946 A1 to Linak A/S. The two documents relates to<br>
a quick release unit based on two cylindrical elements wound with a releasable<br>
coupling spring. The structures are excellent as far as it goes, but they<br>
occupy some space, partly because the coupling spring is to have a certain<br>
length, and partly because the release mechanism is also bulky.<br>
For the sake of completeness it may be mentioned that EP 577 541 B1 to<br>
Linak A/S discloses another quick release unit with two angularly positioned<br>
gear wheels, where the one gear wheel may be displaced out of engagement.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a compact quick release unit of the<br>
type having two cylindrical elements disposed in-line at a location in the<br>
transmission string.<br>
This is achieved according to the invention by constructing the actuator as<br>
stated in claim 1. The structure thus disclosed opens up the possibility of<br>
providing a compact quick release unit.<br>
The quick release unit will be particularly compact if it is constructed such<br>
that the one cylindrical coupling part extends into the other. Then, the<br>
length does not become greater or much greater than the longest coupling<br>
part.<br>
The structure may be even more compact in that the quick release unit is<br>
arranged in connection with a gear wheel, and where the two coupling parts<br>
are received completely or partly in a hollow in the gear wheel. This is particularly<br>
expedient in connection with actuators of the type where a worm<br>
wheel has a cylindrical projection on the one side.<br>
The compactness may be accentuated additionally in that the torquetransferring<br>
mutually engaging means are arranged such that the two coupling<br>
parts have to be pressed toward each other in order to clear each<br>
other. This means that no additional space is required at the sides for the<br>
quick release unit to be released.<br>
The compact structure is additionally accentuated by the use of a cylindrical<br>
spring arranged between a collar on the external and the internal coupling<br>
part, respectively. The collar on the internal coupling part may be formed by<br>
a disc in engagement with an annular groove on the coupling part. The essential<br>
parts of the quick release unit then just appear as a compact cylindrical<br>
unit.<br>
Again, when the torque-transferring engaging means on the outer coupling<br>
part are configured as ribs extending into the hollow thereof, and the other<br>
coupling part has a narrowed end capable of passing through the hole, and<br>
the step between the narrowed end and the outer side of the coupling part<br>
is configured with corresponding ribs, the length of the quick release unit<br>
does not become much longer than the longest coupling part.<br>
In an embodiment, the internal coupling part is expediently secured on the<br>
shaft end of the spindle, while the external coupling part is mounted in engagement<br>
with the gear wheel which drives the spindle.<br>
The activating means may be made compact by configuring it with a disc<br>
having at least one leg, which protrudes through an opening in the gear<br>
wheel, and which, when being pressed in toward the gear wheel, pushes<br>
the outer coupling part out of engagement with the inner coupling part.<br>
Movement of the disc may be effected by an eccentric, which may merely<br>
be a thickened part on a shaft passed out to an operating handle.<br>
In another embodiment, the coupling parts are arranged in extension of<br>
each other on the shaft end of the spindle, which gives a good mount, but a<br>
less compact structure, but the good mount per se provides the possibility<br>
of reducing the length of the coupling parts.<br>
In this embodiment, it is expedient that the facing edges of the coupling<br>
parts are configured with the torque-transferring mutually engaging means<br>
in the form of claws. If, upon release of the quick release unit, it is desired<br>
to couple it again en route, this involves the risk that the claws of the two<br>
coupling parts will ride on the end of each other when the spindle rotates.<br>
To ensure the re-coupling, the quick release unit is constructed such that a<br>
space is present between the claws of such a size that the claws enter into<br>
engagement also during the rotation of the spindle.<br>
In a compact version, the spring is in the form of a cylindrical spring arranged<br>
between a collar on the one coupling part and the side of the worm<br>
wheel, and at the same time the coupling part may be moved against the<br>
spring in toward the worm wheel to interrupt the connection between the<br>
two coupling parts.<br>
In an embodiment of the release mechanism, it comprises a tilting element<br>
which is arranged rotatably about an axis, and which, with a lower part, in a<br>
rest position, is fitted down over the coupling part with a pair of legs and<br>
rests against the collar opposite the spring, which contributes to a short fitting<br>
length.<br>
In an embodiment of the release mechanism, it comprises an axially displaceable<br>
element having a hook-shaped end, which extends into a recess<br>
in an upper inclined part of the tilting element, and which is connected with<br>
the operating handle via a cable, which does not contribute to an increased<br>
fitting length either.<br>
A couple of examples of linear actuators according to the invention will be<br>

ftg. 14 shows a perspective view of the release mechanism,<br>

As will appear from fig. 1 of the drawing, the main components of the actuator<br>
are formed by a two-part cabinet 1 a, 1 b having a reversible electric<br>
motor which, via a worm gear, drives a spindle 2 with a spindle nut 3 to<br>
which an thrust rod 4 (inner tube) surrounded by an outer pipe 5 is secured.<br>
In genera!, the basic structure of the actuator is of the same type as<br>
disclosed in the European Patent EP 647 799 B1 to Linak A/S, which is<br>
hereby incorporated herein by way of reference. It is observed, that the<br>
motor is not shown in the drawing, but it is positioned in the perpendicular<br>
section 1c of the cabinet. The shaft member is extended into a worm in engagement<br>
with a worm wheel 6 mounted on a front member of the motor. It<br>
is observed that the spindle 2 is arranged in the cabinet with a ball bearing<br>
7. Otherwise, only the parts of the actuator necessary to understand the<br>
invention will be described.<br>
Initially, it is observed that the difference between figs. 2-4 and figs. 5-7 is<br>
that the quick release unit in figs. 5-7 is released, while this is not the case<br>
in figs. 2-4.<br>
According to the invention, the actuator is provided with a quick release unit<br>
comprising two coupling parts 8, 9, where the one inner coupling part 8 is<br>
mounted on a shaft end of the spindle 2 with a D groove connection, while<br>
the other outer coupling part 9 is mounted in the worm wheel 6. This worm<br>
wheel is configured with a hollow cylindrical part 10 on the side facing out<br>
toward the front end of the actuator, and the outer coupling part 9 is received<br>
therein in a torque-transferring manner by a splined connection.<br>
The rear side of the worm wheel has arranged thereon a circular disc 11<br>
with three legs 12 which extend through openings in the worm wheel, protrude<br>
into the hollow of the cylindrical part 10 and are guided in grooves<br>
therein. The outer end of the legs 12 is provided with a projection facing in<br>
toward the wall of the hollow and cooperates with an edge therein, so that<br>
the disc cannot be pulled out unintentionally.<br>
The upper part 1b of the cabinet accommodates a release mechanism 13 in<br>
a housing 14 having an entry 31 for a cable (not shown) which leads out to<br>
an operating handle (not shown). The release mechanism comprises a<br>
shaft member 15 passed down behind the circular disc 11. The end of the<br>
shaft member has a boss 16 which is caused to contact the disc 11 by rotation<br>
of the shaft member to press the disc forwards toward the worm wheel.<br>
The shaft member is spring-biased by a spring 17 to the inactive position,<br>
i.e. a position in which the boss 16 is not in contact with the disc 11. A ring<br>
18 is secured to the upper end of the shaft, and the end of the cable, which<br>
leads out to the operating handle, is secured in this ring. The circular recess<br>
in the housing is closed by a cover 19 and a ring 20.<br>
Forwardly, the outer coupling part 9, which is received in the worm wheel,<br>
has internal torque-transferring engaging means in the form of the one part<br>
of a splined connection 21 a. An abutment in the form of a collar 22 is provided<br>
on the outer side of the coupling part 9 at the front end in front of the<br>
splined connection to the worm wheel.<br>
Forwardly, the inner coupling part 8 has a narrowed part 23 which can pass<br>
through the opening of the part of the splined connection 21 which is present<br>
in the outer coupling part 9. The other part of the splined connection<br>
21 b is provided in the step between the narrowed end 23 and the outer side<br>
of the coupling part. A groove for a disc 24 forming an abutment is present<br>
in the narrowed part 23. In the opening, the disc has two diametrically positioned<br>
projections which fit in two corresponding slots which lead into the<br>
groove where the disc is rotated and thereby secured.<br>
A screw spring 25 is arranged between the collar 22 on the outer coupling<br>
part 9 and the abutment 24 on the inner coupling part 8. The spring causes<br>
the two coupling parts to be in mutual engagement via the splined connection<br>
21 a, 21 b. The torque from the worm wheel 6 is transferred to the outer<br>
coupling part 9 via the splined connection in the hollow of the cylindrical<br>
part of the worm wheel and the outer side of the coupling part. The torque<br>
is transferred from the outer coupling part 9 to the inner coupling part 8 via<br>
the splined connection 21 a, 21 b and from there further on to the spindle 2<br>
via the D groove in the inner coupling part.<br>
The quick release unit is activated by operating the release mechanism,<br>
whereby the boss 16 on the shaft member 15 is turned into contact with the<br>
disc 11, which is thereby pressed forwards. The outer coupling part will<br>
thereby be pushed forwards by the legs 12 on the disc 11. The coupling<br>
part 9 rests with the rear edge on projections 26 on the legs which protrude<br>
into the hollow. The splined connection 21 a, 21 b between the outer coupling<br>
part 9 and the inner coupling part 8 will then be interrupted, whereby<br>
the spindle may rotate freely independently of the transmission and the<br>
motor. The thrust rod 4 of the actuator and thereby the element connected<br>
with it may then be adjusted manually.<br>
It is observed for the sake of completeness that the abutment disc 24 on<br>
the inner coupling part 8 rests against the rear side of the ball bearing 7 and<br>
is thereby fixed against axial movement. When the handle of the release<br>
mechanism is released again, the spring 25 will press the outer coupling<br>
part 9 rearwards until the splined connection with the inner coupling part 8<br>
is re-established.<br>
Figs. 8-13 of the drawing show a second embodiment of the actuator according<br>
to the invention. The same parts are designated by the same reference<br>
numerals as are used in the foregoing. The basic structure of the actuator<br>
is of the same type as is shown in figs. 1-8 and described on page 7,<br>
line 23 to page 11, line 14 in the International Application WO 02/29284 A1<br>
to Linak A/S, which is hereby incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
The quick release unit again comprises two coupling parts 8', 9', where the<br>
one coupling part 8' is fixedly mounted on the shaft end of the spindle 2',<br>
while the other coupling part 9' is mounted on the worm wheel 6' which,<br>
here, is mounted on the shaft end of the spindle. On the side facing out toward<br>
the front end of tha actuator, the worm wheel 6' is configured with a<br>
cylindrical part 27, and the coupling part 9' is fixed against rotation, but is<br>
axially displaceably mounted on the cylindrical part 27 with a splined connection.<br>
Moreover, the coupling part 9' is provided with a collar 22' in the<br>
form of a spring ring, and a spring 25' is provided between this collar 22'<br>
and the side of the worm wheel 6, said spring keeping the coupling part 9'<br>
in engagement with the coupling part 8' on the shaft end 2a of the spindle.<br>
The facing edges of the two coupling parts 8', 9' are configured with torquetransferring<br>
mutually engaging means, here in the form of claws 21 a1, 21 b'.<br>
The release mechanism 13' comprises a tilting element 28 which is arranged<br>
rotatably about an axis 28c, and which, with a lower part 28a, in a<br>
rest position, is fitted down over the coupling part 9' with a pair of legs and<br>
rests against the collar 22' opposite the spring 25'. The tilting element 28 is<br>
arranged in a U-shaped housing 31 in the actuator. An axiaily displaceable<br>
element 29 is fitted through an opening, which simultaneously serves as a<br>
guide, said element 29 having a hook-shaped end which extends into a recess<br>
in an upper inclined part 28b of the tilting element and is moreover<br>
connected with an operating handle via a cable. The cable is secured at the<br>
top of the element 29 and is passed in a curve out through the opening 31<br>
in an outer housing 14' secured to the actual housing of the actuator. The<br>
displaceable element 29 is secured against sagging with a locking disc 32<br>
at the top which rides on an edge in the opening of the element 29. Operation<br>
of the handle causes the element 29 to be pulled axiaily upwards,<br>
whereby the tilting element 28 rotates abut its axis 28c, and the legs are<br>
then pressed against the collar 22' and thereby presses the coupling part 9'<br>
in toward the worm wheel 6' and out of engagement with the coupling part<br>
8', whereby the spindle 4' is released from the transmission and the motor.<br>
The thrust rod of the actuator may thereby be adjusted manually, and when<br>
the spindle is not self-locking, the load will cause the spindle to rotate.<br>
When the operating handle is released again, the spring 25' again presses<br>
the coupling part 9' into engagement with the coupling part 8'. Re-coupling<br>
en route is possible in that the claws 21 a1, 21 b' have a relatively great<br>
mutual clearance, which ensures that the claws will not ride on top of each<br>
other during the rotation of the spindle.<br>
The invention thus provides an actuator with a compact structure of the<br>
quick release unit which does not cause an increased fitting length of the<br>
actuator.<br><br><br><br><br>
