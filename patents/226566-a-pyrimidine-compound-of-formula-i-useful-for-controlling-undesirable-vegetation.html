				<td>The present invention relates to a pyrimidine compound of formula I useful for controlling undesirable vegetation.<br>
This invention relates to certain pyrimidines and pyridines, their jV-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts, compositions thereof, and methods of their use for controlling undesirable vegetation.<br>
The control of undesired vegetation is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Achievement of selective control of the growth of weeds especially in such useful crops as rice, soybean, sugar beet, corn (maize), potato, wheat, barley, tomato and plantation crops, among others, is very desirable. Unchecked weed growth in such useful crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of undesired vegetation in noncrop areas is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds which are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, «-propyl, /-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. The term "1-2 alkyl" indicates that one or two of the available positions for that substituent may be alkyl which are independently selected. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenesysuch as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1 -propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds'such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. 'Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, «-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkoxyalkyl" denotes alkoxy substitution on'plkyl. Examples of "alkoxyalkyl" include CH3OCH2, CH3OCH2CH2, CH3CH2OCH^, CH3CH2CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. "Alkenyloxy" includes straight-chain or branched alkenyloxy moieties. Examples of "alkenyloxy" include H2OCHCH2O,<br><br>
(CH3)2OCHCH2O. (CH3)CH=CHCH2O, (CH3)CH=C(CH3)CH2O and CH2=CHCH2CH2O. "Alkynyloxy" includes straight-chain or branched alkynyloxy moieties. Examples of "alkynyloxy" include HC=CCH2O, CH3OCCH2O and CH3CsCCH2CH2O. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio, butylthio, pentylthio and hexylthio isomers. "Alkylthioalkyl" denotes alkylthio substitution on alkyl. Examples of "alkylthioalkyl" include CH3SCH2, CH3SCH2CH2, CH3CH2SCH2, CH3CH2CH2CH2SCH2 and CH3CH2SCH2CH2. "Alkylsulfinyl" includes both enantiomers of an alkylsulfmyl group. Examples of "alkylsulfmyl" include CH3S(O), CH3CH2S(O), CH3CH2CH2S(O), (CH3)2CHS(O) and the different butylsulfinyl, pentylsulfinyl and hexylsulfmyl isomers. Examples of "alkylsulfonyl" include CH3S(O)2, CH3CH2S(O)2, CH3CH2CH2S(O)2, (CH3)2CHS(O)2 and the different butylsulfonyl, pentylsulfonyl and hexylsulfonyl isomers. "Alkylamino", "dialkylamino", "alkenylthio", "alkenylsulfmyl", "alkenylsulfonyl", "alkynylthio", "alkynylsulfinyl", "alkynylsulfonyl", and the like, are defined analogously to the above examples. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form TV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form TV-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form TV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of TV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and /«-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as /-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane. These methods for the preparation of TV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 43, pp 149-161, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. H. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br>
The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "1-2 halogen" indicates that one or two of the available positions for that substituent may be halogen which are independently selected. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of<br><br>
"haloalkyl" include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH2 and CF3CC12. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF3O, CC13CH2O, HCF2CH2CH2O and CF3CH26.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Cj-Cj" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 4. For example, CpC3 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. Examples of "alkylcarbonyl" include C(O)CH3, C(O)CH2CH2CH3 and C(O)CH(CH3)2. Examples of "alkoxycarbonyl" include CH3OC(-O), CH3CH2OC(=O), CH3CH2CH2OC(=O), (CH3)2CHOC(=O) and the different butoxy- or pentoxycarbonyl isomers. In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, all substituents are attached to these rings through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R9, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
The compounds of this invention thus include compounds of Formula I, geometric and stereoisomers thereof, TV-oxides thereof, and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compound of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
The salts of the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids.<br>

DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-12. The definitions of J, A, W, X, Y, Z, R1, R2, R3, R4, R9, R10, and R14 in the compounds of Formulae 1-16 below are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention. Compounds of Formulae la-Ic are various subsets of the compounds of Formula I, and all substituents for Formulae la-Ic are as defined above for Formula I.<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation of compounds of Formula la (Formula I wherein A is A-l). Substituted heterocycles of Formula 1 (where L1 is halogen) can be coupled with metalated aryls or heteroaryls of Formula 2"(where Met is Sn(alkyl)3, B(OH)2 or Zn(LJ)2) in the presence of a palladium(O) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) or in the presence of a palladium(II) catalyst such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) to provide compounds of Formula la. Palladium(II) catalysts are generally used with a suitable base such as aqueous sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate. Suitable solvents for this coupling include TV, 7V-dimethylformamide, dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran. Reaction temperatures range from 20 °C to 130 °C.<br><br>

Substituted heterocycles of Formula 1 are allowed to react with substituted azoles of Formula 3 in the presence of a suitable base such as an alkali carbonate, alkali hydroxide, or alkali hydride in a solvent such as AyV-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 130 °C to provide compounds of Formula Ib.<br>
(Figure Remove)Scheme 3 illustrates a method for preparing compounds of Formula Ic wherein J is an a^ole heterocycle of Formula J-7 and A is A-l or A-2. Compounds of Formula 4 are allowed to react with an azole heterocycle of Formula 3 in a protic or aprotic solvent at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 100 °C in the presence of a suitable base such an alkali carbonate, alkali hydroxide, or alkali hydride to provide compounds of Formula Ic.

(Figure Remove)Substituted pyrimidine intermediates of Formula 1 (wherein J is J-l to J-6) can be prepared by the method shown in Scheme 4. By the synthetic protocol of Menta, E. and Oliva, A. J. Heterocydic Chem. (1997), 34, p 27, a dihalopyrimidine of Formula 5 (where L1 and L2 are halogen) is coupled with a substituted alkyl zinc reagent of Formula 6 (where L3 is halogen) in the presence of a palladium(O) catalyst such as<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) or in the presence of a palladium(II) catalyst such as dichloro-bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II). Palladium(II) catalysts are generally used with a suitable base such as sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate. Suitable solvents for this coupling include A',A'-dimethylformamide, dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran. Reaction temperatures range from 0 °C to 130 °C.<br>

Dihaloheterocycles of Formula 5 can be obtained commercially or can be readily prepared by known methods in the art; for example, see Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry; Katritzky, A.R., Ed.; Academic Press: New York, 1993; volume 58, pp 301-305; Heterocyclic Compounds; Elderfield, R.C., Ed.; John Wiley: New York, 1957; volume 6, chapter 7, pp 265-270.<br>
Zinc reagents of Formula 6 can be made by the method shown in Scheme 5. A substituted alkyl halide of Formula 7 (where L^ is halogen) is allowed to react with activated zinc (see Jubert, C. and Knochel, P. J. Org. Chem. (1992), 57, p 5425; Knochel, P. and Singer, R. D.

Compounds of Formula 1 (wherein R3 and R4 are taken together as C(=O)) can be prepared by the condensation of pyrimidines and pyridines of Formula 10 with aldehydes of Formula 11 in the presence of an imidazolium catalyst of Formula 12 as shown in Scheme 8. This reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong base such as an alkali hydride, preferably sodium hydride, in solvents such- as dichloromethane, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene or other aprotic solvent. The reaction may be carried out at temperatures between 0 and 120 °C. A wide variety of azolium salts are known to catalyze this transformation; see, for example, Miyashita Heterocycles, (1996), 43, 509-512 and references cited therein. A preferred catalyst is 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide.<br>
(Figure Remove)Compounds of Formula I (wherein R3 and R4 are taken together as C(=NOR14)) can be formed directly from compounds of Formula I (wherein R3 and R4 are taken together as C(-O)) by the action of hydroxylamine or capped hydroxylamine salts of Formula 13 as shown in Scheme 9. Many hydroxylamines are commercially available as acid salts and are freed by the action of a base in the presence of the ketone of Formula I. Suitable bases include alkali carbonates, acetates, and hydroxides. These reactions are best carried out in protic solvents, such as lower alcohols, at temperatures between 0 and 120 °C. Especially preferred conditions use sodium carbonate or sodium acetate as base in ethanol at 70 to<br>
80 °C. (Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of Formula I (wherein R3 is OH and R4 is H) can be made by the reduction of ketones of Formula I (wherein R3 and R4 are taken together as C(=O)) as shown in Scheme 10. A wide variety of reduction conditions can be utilized, but for reasons of ease of use and selectivity, alkali borohydrides are preferred reductants. The reduction can be carried out at 0 to 100 °C in a variety of sofvents which are inert to the action of borohydrides. Especially preferred conditions are the use of sodium borohydride in ethanol at 0 to 25 °C.<br>
Scheme 10(Figure Remove)<br>
As shown in Scheme 11, compounds of Formula 1 wherein J is J-7 can also be made via the bromination of compounds ol Formula 14 with molecular bromine in an acidic solvent such as acetic acid at temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 °C in the same way as previously described in Scheme 6. The brominated products of Formula 15 can be displaced by heterocycles of Formula 3 in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate as previously described for Scheme 2. Compounds of Formula 14 are known in the literature or are commercially available. See Benneche (Acta Chemica Scandanavia, 1997, 51, 302) for preparation of these compounds from compounds of Formula 5.<br>
Scheme 11<br>
(Figure Remove)Compounds of Formula 1 in which is cyano can be made as shown in Scheme 12. The reaction of acetonitrile derivatives of formula 16 with compounds of Formula 5 in the presence of a base gives compounds of formula 1 with a cyano group. The reaction can be carried out in a variety of solvents such as dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, or other solvents inert to strong bases. A wide variety of bases which can deprotonate substituted acetonitriles can be used. Sodium hydride and potassium t-butoxide are preferred due to their ease of use and availability. The reaction can be carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 °C. Compounds of formula 16 are well known in the literature and many are commercially available<br>
Scheme 12<br>
(Figure Remove)Compounds of Formula I substituted with the group S(O)nR13 wherein n is 1 or 2 can be prepared from compounds of Formula I substituted with said S(O)nR13 group wherein n is 0 by treatment with an oxidizing reagent such as w-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or Oxone® (potassium peroxymonosulfate). This type of oxidation reaction is well known in the art; for<br>
example, see March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; John Wiley: New York, 1992; 4th edition, pp 1201-1203.<br>
It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula I.<br>
One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula 1 and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents.<br>

Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are highly active preemergent and postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. Many of them have utility for broad-spectrum pre- and/or postemergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired such as around fuel storage tanks, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive-in theaters, air fields, river banks, irrigation and other waterways, around billboards and highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds are useful for the control of selected grass and broadleaf weeds with tolerance to important agronomic crops which include but are not limited to alfalfa, barley, cotton, wheat, rape, sugar beets, corn (maize), sorghum, soybeans, rice, oats, peanuts, vegetables, tomato, potato, perennial plantation crops including coffee, cocoa, oil palm, rubber, sugarcane, citrus, grapes, fruit trees, nut trees, banana, plantain, pineapple, hops, tea and forests such as eucalyptus and conifers (e.g., loblolly pine), and turf species (e.g., Kentucky bluegrass, St. Augustine grass, Kentucky fescue and Bermuda grass). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that not all<br>
compounds are equally effective against all weeds. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth.<br>
A herbicidally effective amount of the compounds of this invention is determined by a number of factors. These factors include: formulation selected, method of application, amount and type of vegetation present, growing conditions, etc. In general, a herbicidally effective amount of compounds of this invention is 0.001 to 20 kg/ha with a preferred range of 0.004 to 1.0 kg/ha. One skilled in the art can Easily determine the herbicidally effective amount necessary for the desired level of weed control.<br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TESTA<br>
Seeds of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), crabgrass (Digitaria spp.), morningglory (Ipomoea spp.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) were planted into a sandy loam soil and treated preemergence by soil drench with test chemicals formulated in a non-phytotoxic solvent mixture which includes a surfactant. At the same time, these crop and weed species were also treated postemergence sprayed to runoff, with test chemicals formulated in the same manner.<br>
Plants ranged in height from two to eighteen cm and were in the one to two leaf stage for the postemergence treatment. Treated plants and untreated controls were maintained in a greenhouse for approximately eleven days, after which all treated plants were compared to untreated controls and visually evaluated for injury. Plant response ratings, summarized in Table A, are based on a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no effect and 10 is complete control. A dash (-) response means no test results.<br><br>
