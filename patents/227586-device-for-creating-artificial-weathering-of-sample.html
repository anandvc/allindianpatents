				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a device for creating artificial weathering<br>
of samples. The weathering-dependent ageing of a sample, in particular of a flat<br>
material sample, is evaluated in such devices by exposing the sample to artificial<br>
weathering. To that end, such devices usually have a weathering chamber<br>
which contains holding means for holding samples to be weathered and a<br>
radiation source for applying radiation to the samples, in particular UV radiation.<br>
Such devices for creating artificial weathering of samples are intended to<br>
estimate the lifetime of materials which are constantly exposed to natural<br>
weather conditions during their use, and which therefore suffer from climatic<br>
effects such as sunlight, solar heat, moisture and the like. In order to obtain a<br>
good simulation of the natural weathering situation, the spectral energy<br>
distribution of the light generated in the device should correspond as closely as<br>
possible to that of natural solar radiation, for which reason xenon radiators are<br>
used as radiation sources in such devices. An accelerated ageing test of the<br>
materials is essentially achieved by much more intense irradiation of the samples<br>
compared with natural conditions, which speeds up the ageing of the samples.<br>
In this way, a prediction of the long-term ageing of a material sample can be<br>
made after a comparatively short time.<br>
A large number of the samples studied in artificial weathering creating<br>
devices consist of polymeric materials. Their deterioration due to weathering is<br>
essentially caused by the UV component of solar radiation. The primary<br>
photochemical processes which take place during this, that is to say the<br><br>
absorption of photons and the generation of excited states or free radicals, are<br>
independent of temperature. The subsequent reaction steps with the polymers<br>
or additives, however, may be temperature-dependent so that the observed<br>
ageing of the materials is also temperature-dependent.<br>
A xenon lamp is normally used as the radiation source in the weathering<br>
testers of the prior art. Although such a lamp is known to be able to simulate the<br>
solar spectrum very well, the emitted radiation nevertheless has a relatively high<br>
spectral component in the infrared spectral range, which needs to be suppressed<br>
by filters in order to prevent excessive heating of the samples. Furthermore, a<br>
commercially available xenon radiation source has only a lifetime of about 1500<br>
hours.<br>
A halogen lamp may also be used as the radiation source, although this<br>
has the disadvantage that it is not adjustable, or can only be adjusted to a minor<br>
extent. The same applies to fluorescent lamps, which likewise have already<br>
been used as radiation sources in weathering testers and which also have the<br>
disadvantage of a relatively short lifetime.<br>
All of the aforementioned radiation sources furthermore have the<br>
disadvantage that they are not spectrally modifiable. But it is often useful to<br>
study the ageing of a material sample as a function of radiation in a limited<br>
wavelength range. For this purpose, admittedly, it is known to resolve the<br>
radiation of a xenon lamp into its spectral components by using a prism or<br>
grating before sending it onto the sample: the different parts of the sample are<br>
then exposed to radiation with a different wavelength and the property changes<br><br>
at different points of the sample can be unequivocally assigned to the<br>
wavelength of the incident radiation. This, however, needs relatively long<br>
exposure times since the spectral exposure level on the sample itself is relatively<br>
low.<br>
Another disadvantage of the aforementioned conventional radiation<br>
sources in weathering testers, due to the way in which they are designed and<br>
operated, is that they are relatively unwieldly and, for example, modified<br>
conditions in respect of the sample surfaces of the material samples to be<br>
exposed cannot therefore be accommodated.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a device for<br>
creating artificial weathering of samples, in which the spectral and spatial<br>
features of the radiation source and the radiation emitted by it can be adapted<br>
more flexibly and, in particular, modified situations of the samples to be exposed<br>
can be accommodated better.<br>
To achieve this object, the present invention provides a device for creating<br>
artificial weathering of samples, having a weathering chamber which contains<br>
holding means for holding samples to be weathered and a UV radiation<br>
arrangement for applying UV radiation to the samples, characterized in that the<br>
UV radiation arrangement comprises a plurality of UV light-emitting diodes<br>
(LEDs).<br>
The invention therefore makes it possible to the use of the availability of<br>
UV light-emitting diodes which has occurred in recent years for a weathering<br>
tester, in particular ones which are based on GaN. GaN LEDs can now<br><br>
satisfactorily cover the entire UV range of the solar spectrum. The obtainable<br>
radiation densities are already so high that the radiation power of a conventional<br>
xenon lamp can readily be achieved by a multiple arrangement of UV LEDs.<br>
The intended UV spectrum depends only on the band gap of the<br>
semiconductor materials used in the LEDs. Additional undesired spectral<br>
components, such as infrared spectral components, are therefore not produced<br>
at all.<br>
Another	advantage	is that the light intensity<br><br>
of the UV radiation which is generated can be adjusted<br>
very easily by means of the current delivered to the<br>
LEDs. The emission spectrum can also be altered to a<br>
limited extent by adjusting the current.<br>
Owing to the compact nature of the LEDs, they<br>
can be arranged in the form of LED arrays. By mounting<br>
them on flexible printed circuit boards, it is also<br>
possible for geometrically non-planar samples to be<br>
exposed almost uniformly, or for a number of samples<br>
inside the weathering chamber to be exposed uniformly.<br>
Virtually any irradiation surfaces can be achieved<br>
since LED arrays are relatively easy to scale.<br>
LEDs are furthermore known to have long<br>
lifetimes, of the order of 1500 hours or more.<br>
Spectral modification of such a UV radiation<br>
arrangement can be achieved by providing a plurality of<br>
different types of light-emitting diodes with differen<br>
spectral emission characteristics, in particular so as<br>
to simulate the ultraviolet spectral component of<br>
natural solar radiation. This makes it possible to<br>
ensure that the UV-A component and the UV-B component<br>
of the solar spectrum are taken into account in a<br>
consistently realistic way. Since the different types<br>
of light-emitting diodes can also be operated<br>
individually, it is also possible to study the effect<br>
of exposing the material samples to individual<br>
wavelength ranges.<br>
It is furthermore possible to provide at least<br>
one other type of light-emitting diode in addition, the<br>
spectral emission of which lies in the visible spectral<br>
range so that, in particular, part of the visible<br>
spectral component of natural solar radiation can also<br>
be simulated. If desired, essentially the entire<br>
spectrum of natural solar radiation can be covered in<br>
this way by providing different types of LEDs with<br>
different emission characteristics.<br>
The LED arrangement is preferably provided as a<br>
regular arrangement of the LEDs, i.e. in particular in<br>
the form of a matrix of rows and columns.<br><br>
It may be necessary to expose material sample<br>
which has a non-planar surfaced topology. In this case,<br>
the LED arrangement may be designed and arranged so<br>
that the LEDs face the sample surface of the material<br>
sample with an equal distance, so as to achieve uniform<br>
exposure of the material sample. If a plurality of<br>
material samples are being exposed, then it is equally<br>
well possible to provide the LEDs at equal distances<br>
from the sample surfaces of the plurality of material<br>
samples. The LED arrangement can accordingly be adapted<br>
to the profile or topology of the single sample<br>
surface, or of the plurality of sample surfaces.<br>
In particular, it may be possible to adapt the<br>
LED arrangement by mounting the LEDs on flexible<br>
printed circuit board, in particular a so-called<br>
flexboard. The mounting may be carried out in a manner<br>
which is known per se by using surface mount technology<br>
(SMT) , with a multiplicity of LEDs being mounted on a<br>
printed circuit board (PCB). It is then possible to use<br>
an LED design which, for example, is described in the<br>
article "Siemens SMT TOPLED for surface mount<br>
technology" by F. Mollmer and G. Waitl in the journal<br>
Siemens Components 29 (1991), volume 4, page 147 in<br>
conjunction with Illustration 1. This form of LED is<br>
extremely compact and makes it possible to arrange a<br>
multiplicity of such LEDs in a row or matrix<br>
arrangement.<br>
If the LEDs are mounted on a flexible printed<br>
circuit board, then this may be supported by fitting it<br>
to a holding body so that it adopts the surface shape<br>
and topology of the latter. This holding body may<br>
consist of a thick metal plate, so that it<br>
simultaneously acts as a heat sink. The metal plate, or<br>
another support, may be pliable in a geometrically<br>
stable way so that it is possible to adapt to modified<br>
sample shapes. The holding body then needs to be<br>
fastened to an inner wall of the weathering chamber.<br>
As an alternative to this, a flexible printed<br>
circuit board itself may be designed, in terms of its<br><br>
thickness and its material, in such a way that it is pliable and respectively<br>
maintains the new state in a geometrically stable way.<br>
In a conventional weathering tester, the sample holding means are formed<br>
by a holding frame closed in a ring shape, which extends concentrically around<br>
the radiation source and, in particular, to which a rotational movement around<br>
the radiation source can be imparted. If the present invention is to be used in a<br>
conventional weathering tester, then the LED arrangement may be provided<br>
inside the ring-shaped holding frame, likewise as an arrangement closed in ring<br>
shape. In particular, a tubular holding body may be provided inside the holding<br>
frame and concentrically with it, the LEDs being fastened in a desired distribution<br>
on the outer circumference of the tubular holding body and electrically connected<br>
in a suitable way. The LEDs are preferably mounted on a flexible printed circuit<br>
board which is in turn placed on the outer circumference of the tubular holding<br>
body and fastened to it. The tubular holding body may be made of a metal, so<br>
that it constitutes a heat sink for dissipating heat from the LEDs.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments in conjunction with the figures of the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
device according to the invention for the artificial weathering of samples ;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a cross section of the tubular holding body shown in Fig. 1<br>
with, fastened to it, the flexible printed circuit board which carries the light-<br>
emitting diodes;<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a flexible printed circuit board which is fastened to a pliable<br>
support and carries the light-emitting diodes ; and<br>
Fig. 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of the use of three different UV<br>
LEDs and their spectral emission characteristics (solid lines) and the cumulative<br><br>
spectral emission curve (broken line).<br>
Fig. 1 represents a longitudinal section of a<br>
device according to the invention for the artificial<br>
weathering of samples.<br>
A holding frame 2 closed in a ring shape is<br>
mounted so that it can rotate in a weathering chamber<br>
1, and samples 3 or work-pieces can be held on its<br>
inner wall. The holding frame 2 has, in particular, a<br>
circular cross section. A tubular holding body 4 is<br>
positioned inside the holding frame 2 and<br>
concentrically with it, by fixing it to the upper wall<br>
of the weathering chamber 1. A flexible printed circuit<br>
board 5 is placed around the outer circumrerence of the<br>
tubular holding body 4 and is fastened to it in a<br>
suitable way. UV light emitting diodes 6 are mounted on<br>
a regular arrangement on tne flexible printed circuit<br>
board 5 by using surface mount technology. These may<br>
comprise different types of light-emitting diodes with<br>
different spectral emission characteristics. They may<br>
furthermore be electrically operated individually, and<br>
each individual light-emitting diode may be operated in<br>
a variable way as a function of time. Also, light-<br>
emitting diodes of one spectral type may be<br>
electrically operated together and light-emitting<br>
diodes of another spectral type may likewise be<br>
electrically operated together. The entire field of<br>
light-emitting diodes may be divided into a number of<br>
sub-fields, each sub-field containing at least one<br>
light-emitting diode of each spectral type to be used.<br>
The holding frame 2 is preferably mounted so<br>
that it can rotate in such a way that the rotation axis<br>
coincides with the axis of the tubular holding body 4,<br>
so that the samples 3 move on a circular path around<br>
the individual light-emitting diodes 6 and at an equal<br>
distance from them.<br>
In a manner which is known per se, the<br>
weathering chamber 1 may also have other artificial<br>
weathering instruments, for example moisture generators<br>
or the like, although these do not play an essential<br><br>
part in the present invention and will not therefore be<br>
discussed in detail. For example, an air flow may also<br>
be blown into the weathering chamber 1 and sweep past<br>
the samples 3 in a vertical direction.<br>
Fig. 2 represents a cross section of the<br>
tubular holding body 4 in Fig. 1. The flexible printed<br>
circuit board 5 is form-fitted around tne outer<br>
circumference of the tubular holding body 4. The UV<br>
light-emitting diodes 6 are applied to it by using the<br>
SMT mounting technology which is known per se. This<br>
will not be described in detail because it is known in<br>
the prior art. The tubular holding body 4 may be made<br>
of a metal or another material with good thermal<br>
conductivity, so tnat tne neat produced in the light-<br>
emitting diodes b can be dissipated efficiently.<br>
Optionally, the air flow produced in the weathering<br>
chamber 1 may also be passed through the interior of<br>
the tubular holding body 4 in order to dissipate the<br>
heat from it.<br>
As shown, the LEDs 6 are arranged in a matrix.<br>
Instead of this, the rows may also be arranged<br>
alternately with an offset between LEDs that lie above<br>
one another, with one LED respectively being placed<br>
level with the gap between the two LEDs arranged in the<br>
row above.<br>
The dynamic electrical operability of the<br>
individual light-emitting diodes may, for example, may<br>
be used for energy-saving operation of the UV radiation<br>
arrangement. Specifically, for example, if only a<br>
relatively small number of material samples are to be<br>
artificially weathered, then they may be fastened next<br>
to one other on the holding frame 2 over a particular<br>
limited angular sector of it. When the holding frame 2<br>
is set in rotation, then only those light-emitting<br>
diodes which lie in the relevant angular sector are<br>
always supplied with current, so that the material<br>
samples are exposed to the light-cone of UV radiation<br>
moving around at an angular speed which is the same as<br>
the angular speed of the holding frame 2. It is merely<br><br>
necessary to provide suitable electrical operation and<br>
programming of the light-emitting diodes 6.<br>
As mentioned above, the entire diode field of<br>
the light-emitting diodes 6 may be divided into sub-<br>
fields which respectively contain at least one light-<br>
emitting diode of a particular spectral type.<br>
Spectrally different light-emitting diodes may be<br>
arranged in each of these sub-fields, so that radiation<br>
approximately comparable to the solar spectrum can be<br>
emitted.<br>
But if only the UV component of the solar<br>
spectrum is to be approximately simulated, for example,<br>
then three different light-emitting diodes with three<br>
different emission curves in the UV spectrum may be<br>
used. This is represented in Fig. 4 where, by way of<br>
example, the emission curves of three spectrally<br>
different light-emitting diodes which add up to give an<br>
overall emission curve are plotted between the<br>
wavelengths 300 nm and 400 nm. Since the three light-<br>
emitting diodes can be operated independently of one<br>
another, the emitted UV spectrum can therefore be<br>
adjusted flexibly.<br>
The way in which a conventional weathering<br>
tester may be constructed according to the invention<br>
was described with reference to Fig. 1. An important<br>
point of the present invention goes beyond this,<br>
however, since it permits spatial adaptation of the UV<br>
radiation arrangement to one or more of the material<br>
samples to be exposed. This is shown in Fig. 4 by way<br>
of example in relation to a material sample 3 which has<br>
a particular surface topology. The invention now makes<br>
it possible to expose this material sample 3 in such a<br>
way that the distance between the light-emitting diodes,<br>
6 and the sample surface is spatially constant. In<br>
order to do this, the light-emitting diodes 6 are<br>
fastened on a flexible printed circuit board 5 in the<br>
manner already described above. Since in general the<br>
flexible printed circuit board 5 itself is not<br>
geometrically stable, it is applied to a substrate 7<br><br>
whose shape can be altered and which keeps the shape<br>
when it is changed, that is to say it is geometrically<br>
stable. The substrate 7 may, for example, be a<br>
lightweight pliable metal sheet which again acts<br>
simultaneously as a heat sink for the heat to be<br>
dissipated from the light-emitting diodes 6. The<br>
substrate 7 then merely needs to be fastened in a<br>
suitable way on the inner wall of the weathering<br>
chamber. It is also conceivable to use a flexible<br>
printed circuit board which can be altered in a<br>
geometrically stable way owing to the way in which it<br>
is constructed, so that it is unnecessary to use an<br>
additional substrate 7.<br>
If a rotational movement is imparted to the<br>
material sample 3 in Fig. 4, then the LED arrangement<br>
may likewise be moved in co-rotation with the same<br>
angular speed, so that the material sample 3 and the<br>
LED arrangement are always in a constant spatial<br>
relation to one another.<br><br>
