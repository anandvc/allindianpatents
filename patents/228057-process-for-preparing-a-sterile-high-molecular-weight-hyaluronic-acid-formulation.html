				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING A STERILE HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT HYALURONIC ACID FORMULATION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a sterile high molecular<br>
weight hyaluronic acid salt as a final formulation for pharmaceutical use.<br>
Hyaluronic acid in its salt form may for instance include sodium hyaluronate,<br>
potassium hyaluronate, magnesium hyaluronate, calcium hyaluronate, or<br>
others.<br>
Hyaluronic acid is a mucoid polysaccharide of biological origin, which is widely<br>
distributed in nature. For example, it is known that hyaluronic acid is present in<br>
various animal tissues such as umbilical cord, synovial fluid, vitreous humor,<br>
rooster comb and various connective tissues such as skin and cartilage.<br>
Chemically, hyaluronic acid is a member of glycosaminoglycans and it is<br>
constituted by alternating and repeating units of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-<br>
D-glucosamine, to form a linear chain having a molecular weight up to 13 x 106<br>
Daltons.<br>
In the meaning of the present invention, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid<br>
is hyaluronic acid having an average molecular weight of not less than 0.5 x 106<br>
Daltons.<br>
Pharmaceutical use of hyaluronic acid or of a salt thereof is widely described in<br>
the literature.<br>
Since hyaluronic acid is a non-immunogenic substance and has viscoelastic<br>
and hydrophilic properties, it is used, since several years, as an eye vitreous or<br>
joint fluid replacement or as a supportive medium in ophthalmic surgery, as<br>
disclosed for example in US-A-4,141,973 of Balazs.<br>
In joint fluids, the viscous hyaluronic acid solution serves as a lubricant to<br>
provide a protective environment to the cells, and for this reason, it is used in<br>
the treatment of inflamed knee joints.<br>
EP-A-0 781 547 discloses a sodium hyaluronate based ophthalmic formulation<br>
for use in eye surgery.<br>
EP-A-0 719 559 discloses sodium hyaluronate viscous solutions for use as<br>
masking fluid in therapeutic photokeratectomy by means of excimer laser.<br>
EP-A-0 875 248 discloses the use of hyaluronic acid or of one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the preparation of an aqueous solution<br>
useful as intra-articular lavage liquid.<br>
EP-A-0 698 388 of Chemedica S.A. discloses an ophthalmic preparation for<br>
use as artificial tears containing hyaluronate as a viscosity thickener.<br>
The pharmaceutical use of hyaluronic acid or of a salt thereof requires a highly<br>
pure and sterile product.<br>
Hyaluronic acid can be extracted and purified from animal or microbial sources<br>
such as umbilical cords, rooster combs or from group A and C Streptococci as<br>
disclosed for example in US-A-4,141,973 of Balazs, US-A-5,559,104 of Romeo<br>
et al. and WO 00/4925.<br>
Industrial extraction and purification processes of hyaluronic acid typically<br>
produce hyaluronic acid salts, such as sodium hyaluronate, in the form of a<br>
dried powder. The purified pharmaceutical grade dried povfer may be used for<br>
preparing, for example, aqueous pharmaceutical formulations for the various<br>
pharmaceutical uses such as interarticular injection, eye drops or vitreous<br>
humor replacement.<br>
A common industrial process for preparing ready-to-use pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprises the mixing of a defined quantity in weight of sodium<br>
hyaluronate with a precise volume of water and, as the case may be, salt such<br>
as sodium chloride and buffers such as phosphates and other excipients. As<br>
the concentration and composition of the formulation for pharmaceutical use<br>
should remain within a narrowly defined range, the various components of the<br>
formulation are carefully measured. The formulation is then filled into recipients<br>
such as syringes and vials of defined dosages ready for use. Subsequent to<br>
filling of the recipients, the formulation is sterilized by autoclave typically at<br>
around 121° C for fifteen minutes or more.<br>
One of the problems with the use of heat to sterilize hyaluronic acid is the<br>
known effect on breaking the molecular chains forming HA, thus reducing the<br>
average molecular weight of HA.<br>
The high molecular weight of hyaluronic acid is an important pharmacological<br>
property.<br>
In many pharmaceutical applications it is undesirable to have low molecular<br>
weight hyaluronic acid in the formulation, for example in view of the<br>
inflammatory effects of low molecular weight HA as reported in US 4,141,973<br>
and the loss of beneficial rheological properties of high molecular weight HA. In<br>
order to compensate for degradation of the HA in a formulation of given<br>
concentration in the aforementioned sterilization methods, the hyaluronic acid<br>
or salts thereof initially used in preparing the formulation have an. average<br>
molecular weight that is higher than that of the desired minimum average<br>
molecular weight of the final formulation. This is however uneconomical since<br>
the yield of hyaluronic acid from starting material decreases as the average<br>
molecular weight required increases..<br>
Another known method of sterilizing hyaluronic acid is by filtration. This<br>
technique is used in conventional industrial processus for preparing purified<br>
hyaluronic acid salts in a concentrated form, usually in the form of dried<br>
powder, whereby a low concentration aqueous solution is passed through the<br>
filter and subsequently dried.<br>
Such sterilization steps are for example described in European patent<br>
application EP 867453 and in PCT application WO 00/44925. In these<br>
applications, a filter with a pore size as small as 0.22 µm is also disclosed for<br>
sterilization: Filters having a pore size of 0.22 µm have a bacterial challenge of<br>
1 over 107 bacteria, based on the smallest known bacterium Pseudomonas<br>
diminuta, while filters having a pore size of 0.45 µm have a bacterial challenge<br>
of 1 over 104 bacteria (always based on Pseudomonas diminuta). For this<br>
reason, filters having a pore size less than 0.45 µm are considered to be<br>
sterilizing.<br>
In conventional industrial processes, the method of sterilization by filtration is<br>
not known to be used for preparing high viscosity pharmaceutical formulations<br>
ready for use, since at the required concentration of HA in high viscosity<br>
pharmaceutical aqueous formulations, typically in the range of 1 .to 2% wt/v, not<br>
all of the hyaluronic acid passes through the filter at 0.22 µm. Since this results<br>
in a change in the concentration and/or a loss of hyaluronic acid, sterilization by<br>
filtration for preparing ready-to-use high viscosity pharmaceutical formulations<br>
is problematic.<br>
In US 5,093,487, the preparation of an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation<br>
comprising high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate ready for use and<br>
sterilized through a filter of 0.22 µm is described. The sterilizing method<br>
described in this patent however relies on a number of passes of hyaluronic<br>
acid aqueous formulation through the 0.22 pm filter, so as to irreversibly reduce<br>
the viscosity of the hyaluronic acid. The sterilization of an aqueous<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising HA at a concentration of 1% or more is.<br>
according to this publication, possible in view of the reduction of viscosity of the<br>
hyaluronic acid resulting from the multiple passes through the filter. It is further<br>
argued in this application that the viscosity is reduced without reducing the<br>
molecular weight of HA. Without wishing to take position on the validity of the<br>
findings reported in the aforementioned publication, for many pharmaceutical<br>
applications such as intra-articular applications, the lowering of the viscosity of<br>
HA is undesirable.<br>
An object of the present invention is to obtain a sterile ready-to-use<br>
pharmaceutical aqueous formulation comprising a hyaluronic acid salt, that is<br>
sterile and economical to produce, particularly in industrial conditions. It is<br>
advantageous to provide such formulation with a narrow tolerance in the<br>
concentration of the ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Objects of this invention have been achieved by a process for preparing a<br>
sterile high molecular weight hyaluronic acid formulation for pharmaceutical use<br>
according to claim 1.<br>
Disclosed herein is a process for preparing a sterile ready-to-use aqueous<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid<br>
salt (HA) at a specified final concentration, comprising the steps of:<br>
- providing an aqueous formulation comprising high molecular weight HA at a<br>
concentration less than the specified final concentration;<br>
- passing said aqueous formulation through a filter having a pore size<br>
not exceeding 0.45 urn;<br>
- concentrating said aqueous formulation by applying a vacuum and boiling off<br>
water until said specified final concentration is reached.<br>
Advantageously, the reduced concentration of the aqueous formulation prior to<br>
filtering, as a function of the molecular weight, reduces the viscosity and<br>
enables the entire HA to pass through the filter and be sterilized, the<br>
subsequent boiling with a vacuum ensuring that essentially no heat dependent<br>
degradation of HA occurs. The process is well adapted to an industrial<br>
environment and is particularly economical, allowing ready-to-use dosages of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising HA to be filled in sterile recipients<br>
without further sterilization.<br>
A further advantage is that the formulation is microbiologically stable and may<br>
be kept for weeks before being used as pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Viscosity of HA in aqueous solution is a property that depends on several<br>
parameters such as molecular weight, concentration, temperature,<br>
concentration and quality of salts, pH and shear rate applied to the solution.<br>
Higher molecular weight and concentration increase the viscosity, while higher<br>
shear rate and salts decrease the viscosity. Regarding the temperature, HA has<br>
a hysteretic behavior as reported by M. Cardones et al. "Hysteresis Behavior of<br>
Sodium Hyaluronate Solutions during Heating and Cooling", Clear Solutions<br>
Biotech, Inc., Technical Rep 01. Viscosity increases and decreases in an<br>
irregular way by increasing or decreasing the temperature. Between 60° C and<br>
70° C it is possible to get the minimum viscosity of the solution. Therefore, this<br>
hysteretic property can be used for decreasing or increasing the viscosity of the<br>
solution, but it has to be considered that the HA chains degradation is<br>
proportional to the temperature and the duration at which this temperature is<br>
kept.<br>
During the concentrating step after filtration, the concentration of HA may be<br>
monitored in real time in order to stop the vacuum boiling when the specified<br>
concentration for the ready-to-use pharmaceutical formulation is reached. The<br>
monitoring or measuring process may advantageously be carried out with a<br>
spectrophotometer with the sensing beam placed in the formulation, the<br>
absorption of radiation in the ultraviolet range (UV) being proportional to the HA<br>
concentration. A particularly advantageous feature of this invention is that it<br>
obviates the need to mix exact quantities of water and hyaluronic acid to obtain<br>
the specified concentration and ensure that such concentration is maintained<br>
through the process. Instead, the initial HA and water mix has an approximate<br>
concentration lower than the final formulation, thus simplifying the process.<br>
The vacuum applied during the concentrating process is preferably j not exceeding<br>
200 millibars absolute pressure, in particular in the range of 30 to 60 millibars,<br>
for example 40 millibars, whereby the boiling temperature is around 26 to 28°<br>
C. Industrial equipment is economical to operate reliably at such pressures, and<br>
the low temperature avoids any significant or measurable reduction of the<br>
hyaluronic acid molecular weight.<br>
The filter pore size is advantageously not exceeding 0.22 urn, thus ensuring the<br>
preparation of a highly sterile formulation. Filter sterilized ready-to-use high<br>
viscosity pharmaceutical formulation with HA concentration in the range of 1 to<br>
3% can thus advantageously be prepared in a sterile and economical manner,<br>
according to this invention.<br>
Further advantageous aspects of this invention will be apparent from the claims<br>
and the following detailed description of an example of a process and annexed<br>
drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 represents a flow chart illustrating steps in an embodiment of the process<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are graphs represent the percentage of HA of molecular weight<br>
1.1 million and 2.2 million Daltons, respectively, passing through a filter of 0.22<br>
urn as a function of the % wt/v concentration in an aqueous solution, at 20° C<br>
and neutral pH;<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph representing the optical density (OD) at 230 nm of the<br>
formulation as a function of time during the concentration process as measured<br>
by a spectrophotometer.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a process for preparing a ready-to-use aqueous<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid<br>
salt at a specified pharmaceutical concentration is shown. Prior to preparing the<br>
formulation, the process plant equipment is cleaned with purified water (step 1),<br>
sterilized with clean steam (step 2), and washed with sterile distilled water for<br>
injection (WFI) (step 3).<br>
A preparation of an aqueous HA formulation, for example a diluted sodium<br>
hyaluronate solution at a concentration less than the concentration specified for<br>
the final pharmaceutical formulation is introduced into a mixing reactor for<br>
preparing the prefiltered formulation (step 4).<br>
The aqueous HA solution may either be prepared from a dried HA salt or from<br>
the solution prepared according to PCT application WO 00/44925, before the<br>
drying process.<br>
The addition of a concentrated salt solution (25x), dosed by a peristaltic pump,<br>
is carried out in order to add the right amount of salts coupled with the amount<br>
of HA added (step 5). The salt solution normally contains NaCI, buffers and<br>
other excipients specified for the final pharmaceutical formulation, and they are<br>
added in order to bring the pH to a physiological pH, such as 7.4, and to give<br>
the final formulation the physiological osmolarity, such as 300 mOsm/lt.<br>
The salt solution, buffers and other excipients may also be added aseptically<br>
after the filtration step 7 directly into the reaction chamber. This is particularly<br>
advantageous for very high molecular weight HA in view of the fact that salts<br>
decrease the filterability of HA and thus would require greater dilution of the<br>
pre-filtered solution. The amount of excipients added can be monitored in real<br>
time by an electrical conductivity sensor (probe) in the reaction chamber. The<br>
conductivity of the HA formulation is related to the amount of excipient in the<br>
formulation and can be determined empirically. Thus, by measuring the<br>
conductivity of the HA formulation as excipient is added in the reaction chamber<br>
until the required concentration is reached, the required amount of excipient in<br>
the formulation can be added in a simple, reliable and precise manner. The<br>
aforegoing in particular obviates the need to calculate and measure dosages in<br>
advance, and in particular removes the problem of having to take into account<br>
and compensate for the certain amount of HA, even if small, retained by the<br>
filter during the filtration step 7.<br>
By way of example, the formulation may be prepared from 45 grams of dried<br>
sodium hyaluronate of an average molecular weight of 2.2 million Daltons<br>
mixed-with 15 liters of WFI. In this case, due to the high molecular weight of<br>
HA, the salts and buffer solution is added after filtration in order to avoid a<br>
greater dilution of the pre-filtered solution than needed, as mentioned above.<br>
A stirring machine in the reactor mixes the prefiltered solution (step 6), for<br>
example for about 120 minutes, until it is homogeneous. In this particular<br>
example, the prefiltered solution has an HA concentration of 0.3% wt/v. At this<br>
concentration, hyaluronic acid with a molecular weight of 2.2 million Daltons, at<br>
room temperature and physiological pH, has a low viscosity which enables it to<br>
pass entirely through a filter with pore size of 0.22 p. The maximum viscosity<br>
at which all of the HA formulation passes through a filter having a pore size of<br>
0.22 urn, is found to be approximately 5 Pas as measured at 0.1 s-1 shear rate<br>
at 20° C . This maximum viscosity however will depend on the filter pore size: a<br>
smaller pore size, such as 0,1 urn, would lower this maximum viscosity at which<br>
all HA would pass through the filter.<br>
As discussed above, the maximum concentration of HA in an aqueous solution<br>
at which substantially all the HA will pass through a sterilizing filter, for example<br>
a filter of 0.22 µm, will depend on the molecular weight of the hyaluronic acid.<br>
This may be shown with reference to the graphs shown in Figures 2 and 3,<br>
whereby Fig. 2 shows the percentage of sodium hyaluronate at average<br>
molecular weight of about 1.1 million Daltons passing through a filter of 0.22 µm<br>
pore size at substantially ambient temperature (around 20° C) and substantially<br>
neutral pH (around 7) as a function of the concentration (grams of sodium<br>
hyaluronate per deciliter of water - % wt/v).<br>
Fig. 3 shows a similar graph under the same conditions except that the sodium<br>
hyaluronate has an average molecular weight of about 2.2 million Daltons. It<br>
may be seen on the graph of Fig. 2 that all the sodium hyaluronate at a<br>
molecular weight of 1.1 million Daltons passes through the filter up to a<br>
concentration of about 0.92% wt/v (or g/dl), whereas for sodium hyaluronate<br>
having a molecular weight of 2:2 million Daltons, the maximum concentration is<br>
approximately 0.32% wt/v. Therefore, as the molecular weight of the hyaluronic<br>
acid salt increases from 1.1 to 2.2 million Daltons, the maximum concentration<br>
of HA in an aqueous solution to pass 100% through the 0.22 µm filter will<br>
decrease from about 0.94% wt/v to about 0.32% wt/v.<br>
In an industrial process, and considering that after filtration the solution is<br>
concentrated, it is preferred to have a concentration somewhat lower than the<br>
upper limit to ensure that the filtering process is complete and reliable with a<br>
certain margin for error or variations from batch to batch in the molecular weight<br>
of the sodium hyaluronate, the temperature, and the mixing concentrations.<br>
The solution may be forced through the sterilizing filter (step 7) by introducing a<br>
gas under pressure, such a nitrogen, for example at around 3 bars pressure in<br>
the mixing reactor, or by means of a pump. The sterilizing filter preferably has a<br>
pore size of 0.22 µm, but filters having other pore sizes less than 0,45 µm and<br>
greater than around 0.1 µm, may also be used to the extent such filters are or<br>
become commercially available.<br>
When all the solution has passed through the filter into a distiller, the distiller is<br>
sealed off from the filter and mixing reactor with a valve, and a vacuum pump is<br>
activated and regulates the pressure in the distiller by means of a regulatory<br>
valve (steps 8, 9, 10). The pressure is less than 200 millibars in order to bring<br>
the boiling temperature below 60° C, but preferably the pressure is in the region<br>
of 30 to 60 millibars, for example at 40 millibars, whereby the boiling<br>
temperature of water is in the region of 26 to 28° C, close to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Instead of the distiller, a thin film evaporator or any other under-vacuum<br>
concentrators can be useful for a batch, fed-batch or continuous concentration<br>
of the HA formulation.<br>
A heating jacket around the distiller supplies heat energy during the boiling<br>
process. Advantageously, the boiling temperature of less than 30° C ensures<br>
that there is essentially no degradation of the hyaluronic acid such that the<br>
molecular weight of the hyaluronic acid is not reduced.<br>
An HA concentration sensor, advantageously in the form of a<br>
spectrophotometer having an optical fibre immersed in the formulation, may be<br>
provided to measure in real time the concentration of hyaluronic acid (step 11)<br>
and automatically stops the boiling process when the specified concentration is<br>
reached. The spectrophotometer may for example be based on the absorption<br>
of a beam of ultraviolet light (e.g. wave length 230 nm) positioned within the<br>
solution in the distiller. Fig. 4 shows the optical density at 230 nm measured<br>
over time during the whole concentration process (for example up to 2 % w/v.)<br>
The real time HA concentration measurement obviates the need to mix very<br>
precise quantities during the preparation of the diluted prefiltered solution, thus<br>
simplifying the process.<br>
The vacuum boiling also has an important advantage of degassing the<br>
formulation which, in view of the mixing process and application of nitrogen at<br>
high pressure during the filtering process, comprises bubbles, microbubbles<br>
and dissolved gas that are not acceptable in the final pharmaceutical<br>
formulation.<br>
When the HA concentration sensor in the distiller signals that the specified<br>
concentration is attained, the pressure in the distiller is rapidly increased by<br>
introducing gas, for example nitrogen, therein (step 13) and the jacket heating<br>
around the distiller is cooled to ambient temperature or less, thus immediately<br>
stopping the concentration process of the formulation (step 12).<br>
It may be noted that with a process according to this invention, the<br>
concentration of hyaluronic acid in the formulation may be in the range up to<br>
3%, depending on the specified pharmaceutical use.<br>
The formulation can then be pumped or pushed by a gas (e.g. nitrogen) under<br>
pressure into sterile tanks (steps 28, 30) for filling at another location and/or in<br>
a subsequent stage directly into sterile recipients, such as syringes (step 16),<br>
ready for use. The pharmaceutical formulation may also be directly filled into<br>
sterile recipients for pharmaceutical use without intermediate storage in a sterile<br>
tank.<br>
