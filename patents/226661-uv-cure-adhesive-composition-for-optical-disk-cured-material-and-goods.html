Description<br>
UV-CURE ADHESIVE COMPOSITION FOR OPTICAL DISK, CURED MATERIAL<br>
AND GOODS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive composition for an optical disk, in particular, a UV-curable adhesive composition for bonding two disk substrates and allowing the substrates to adhere with curing with ultraviolet rays as is typical for DVDs, and a bonded optical disk obtained by using the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
DVDs in practical use at present, which are bonded optical disks, can be roughly classified into DVD-ROMs on which information such as movies has been recorded when producing the disk and blank DVDs on which no information is recorded upon production allowing consumers themselves to record information on the pigment recording layer or the inorganic recording layer.  DVD-ROMs include DVD-5 with a recording layer structure of single-sided, single layer read having a recording capacity of about 5 GB, DVD-9 of a single-sided, dual layer read having a recording capacity of about 9 GB, DVD-10-of a double-sided, dual layer read having a recording capacity of about 10 GB, and DVD-18 of a double-sided, quadruple layer read having a recording capacity cf about 18 GB.  At<br><br>
present, DVD-9s are most commonly used because of their recording capacity for recording a movie of about two and a half hours.  Presently, DVD-9s using an aluminum alloy as a total reflection film and gold as a translucent reflection film are most common.  Unlike a total reflection film, a translucent reflection film must transmit laser, and so the film needs to be thin.  Thus, gold, which can be easily formed into a thin film and is relatively stable, has been conventionally used.<br>
Gold, however, is very expensive and therefore the material for a translucent reflection film has been shifted from gold to silicon or a silicon compound, and further to silver or a silver alloy. In addition, use of blue lasers is now being developed for further increase of recording capacity. While red lasers do not have any problem of laser transmittance even if the material for the translucent reflection film is gold, silicon, a silicon compound, silver or a silver alloy, it has been recognized that for blue lasers, silver or a silver alloy is effective as the material for a translucent reflection film in view of the transmittance at about 4 00 nm which is the wavelength of the blue laser. Silver and silver alloys, however, has a disadvantage that they are more susceptible to oxidation and unstable than gold. When a thin film of silver or a silver alloy is used for a translucent reflection film and is allowed to adhere with a conventional adhesive for a bonded optical disk, a durability equivalent to those of bonded optical disks in which gold is used as a<br><br>
material for the translucent reflection f i lm cannot be afforded, and an adhesive having a satisfactory durability has not been provided yet.<br>
On the other hand, in the field of blank DVDs, there are various formats including DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM.  Presently dominant DVD-R, DVD-RAM, DVD+R and DVD+RW are of single-sided, single layer structure, in which silver or a silver alloy having a high reflectance, as well as an aluminum compound, is used as a material for a reflection film. However, because silver or a silver alloy is subject to oxidation, a protective coat must be formed. Although formation of the protective coat has an advantage of achieving a high durability, it has involved problems such as decrease of production efficiency of optical disks, increase of production cost and decrease of production yield.  For such reason, development of an adhesive which can afford a durability equivalent to those of conventional optical disks without forming a protective coat has been desired.<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies and as a result, have developed an adhesive which can impart durability as high as that of a conventional optical disk using gold as a translucent reflection film, even to a bonded optical disk obtained by adhering a translucent reflection film comprising silver or a silver alloy, as described in Japanese Patent Application Laying Open (KOKAI) No. 2002-265885. However, although these adhesives can afford a somewhat high durability, two problems were left unsolved.  The first<br><br>
problem is generation of voids (air bubbles) when bonding two optical disk substrates by an optical disk manufacturing apparatus. This problem was mostly found in DVDs of single-sided, single layer read type such as DVD-5s and blank DVDs. The second is a problem of degradation in reflectance of the silver or a silver alloy translucent reflection film when a bonded optical disk using silver or a silver alloy translucent reflection film is exposed to sunlight for a long time.<br>
The mechanism for preventing voids in optical disk manufacturing apparatuses which is widely employed in th
resistance of 1000 MQ-cm or less, and highly conductive, and thus voids were hardly introduced into DVDs manufactured by the aforementioned optical disk manufacturing apparatus. However, along with the shift of the material for the translucent reflection film to a silver or a silver alloy which is highly susceptible to oxidation, adhesive components used for the material also shifted toward low concentration of ions - and rendering the components hydrophobic. Adhesives for silver or a silver alloy reflection film presently used thus have a high electrical resistance, and for example, when<br><br>
manufacturing DVDs, in particular, single-sided, single layer read-only DVDs by the aforementioned apparatus, there is a problem that because no metal reflection film is provided on a substrate where recording is not conducted, applied voltage of the aforementioned apparatus cannot afford electric current sufficient to prevent generation of voids and as a result, voids are easily generated.<br>
In addition, degradation in reflectance of^the translucent reflection film due to long time exposure to sunlight is a phenomenon occurring only when silver or a silver alloy is used for the translucent reflection film, which does not occur when the material for the translucent reflection filmisgold, siliconor a silicon compound. Thus, aUV-curable resin composition for bonding an optical disk capable of suppressing degradation in reflectance even in the case of using silver or a silver alloy for a translucent reflection film has been demanded.<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
The present invention aims at providing an adhesive which exhibits, in a bonded optical disk obtained by adhering a translucent reflection film comprising silver or silver alloy, a high durability equivalent to those of conventional optical disks in which gold is used for a translucent reflection film, and providing a UV-cure adhesive which is free of inclusion of voids when bonding by an optical disk manufacturing apparatus, and which can suppress degradation in reflectance<br><br>
even if an optical disk obtained by bonding is exposed to sunlight for a long time.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies to solve the above-mentioned problem and as a result, have found that by bending a translucent reflection film comprising silver or a silver alloy by using a UV-cure adhesive having a specific composition, voids are not generated when bonding by an optical disk manufacturing apparatus, high durability of an optical disk obtained by bonding can be achieved, and the degradation in reflectance of the translucent reflection film of an optical disk obtained by bonding can be suppressed, which resulted in the completion of the present invention-According ly, the present invention relates to<br>

The epoxy (meth)acrylate (A) in the present invention has a function to improve the curability and the hardness of the cured product, as well as to decrease the electrical resistivity of a UV-cure resin composition and to suppress degradation in reflectance when the optical disk bonded by using the resin composition of the present invention is exposed to sunlight for a long time. In the present invention, as the epoxy (meth) acrylate (A) , any compound can be used as long as it is obtained by reacting a glycidyl ether epoxy compound and (meth) acrylic acid.

A monofunctional (meth) acrylate (C) containing a^ hydroxyl group may be contained (concurrently used) in the UV-cure resin composition for bonding an optical disk of the<br><br>
present invention.  Specific examples of ~he monofunctional (meth)acrylate (C) containing a hydroxy1 group that can be used together include 2-hydroxyethyl (rr.eth) acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydrcxybutyl (meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, dipropylene glycol (meth)acrylate, polypropylene glycol (meth)acrylate, caprolactone acrylate and aliphatic epoxy acrylate.

The reaction is conducted, for example, as follows . That is, organic polyisocyanate is mixed to polyhydric alcohol so that the amount of the isocyanate group is 1.1 to 2 . 0 equivalents per 1 equivalent of the hydroxyl group, and the reaction is<br>
conducted at a reaction temperature of preferably 70 to 90°C to synthesize a urethane oligomer. Then a<br>
hydroxy(meth)acrylate compound is added so that the amount of the hydroxyl group is preferably 1 to 1.5 equivalents per<br><br>
1 equivalent of the isocyanate group of the urethane oligomer, and the reaction is conducted at a reaction temperature of<br>
70 to 90°C to give an objective urethane (r.eth) acrylate.  The molecular weight of the urethane (meth;acrylate (F) is preferably 400 to 10000.  The urethane (meth) acrylate (F) may be used alone or in a mixture of two or more. The content of the urethane (meth)acrylate (F) in ~he composition is "" usually 1 to 20% by weight, and preferably 5 to 15% by weight.<br>

Specific examples of the phosphorus compound include tris(nonylated phenyl) phosphite, ADKSTAB PER-4C (available from Asahi Denka Co., Ltd.), ADKSTAB 260 (available from Asahi Denka Co., Ltd.) and ADKSTAB 522A (available from Asahi Denka Co., Ltd.). One or more of the additives may be contained. The content of the additive (G) in the composition is usually 0.005 to 10% by weight, and preferably 0.01 to 5% by weight.<br>
The UV-cure resin composition of the present invention may also contain, as a high molecular polymer, polyester-, polycarbonate-, polyacrylic-, polyurethane- or polyvinyl-based resin.  The composition may also contain<br><br>
additives such as an organic solvent, a silane coupling agent, a polymerization inhibitor, a leveling agent, an antistatic agent, a surface lubricant, a ultraviolet absorber and filler, where necessary.<br>
The UV-cure resin composition of the present invention can be obtained by mixing and dissolving each component<br>
mentioned above at room temperature to SC°C, and impurities may be removed by filtration where necessary. The viscosity<br>
at 25°C of the UV-cure resin composition of the present invention is^ preferably in the range of 100 to 5000 mPa-S (measured by a Brookfield type viscometer) in consideration of coating property.<br>
It is preferable to blend the aforementioned" chemical<br>
agents so that the electrical resistivity at 25°C of the UV-cure resin composition of the present invention falls into the range<br>
of 0 to 1000 MQ-cm, particularly 0 to 600 MQ-cm.  In the present invention, the electrical resistivity was measured by using<br>
R8340 ULTRA HIGH RESISTANCE METER made by ADVANTEST Corporation.<br>
Another finding is that when one or both of the optical disk substrates to be bonded are a silver or silver alloy reflection film, it is suitable that the UV-cure resin composition has an electrical resistivity at 25°C of 1000 MQ-cm or less, preferably 100 to 1000 MQ-cm, and particularly preferably 100 to 600 MQ-cm for an optical disk manufacturing apparatus which conducts bonding by applying a voltage. A nv-rMiro rp.qin comoosition with such function is prepared by<br><br>
accordingly selecting components from the aforementioned epoxy (meth) acrylate (A), photopolymeriza'ion initiator (B) , monofunctional (meth) acrylate (C) containing a hydroxyl group, (meth)acrylate phosphate compound (D) and mono- to trifunctional (meth)acrylate monomer (E; .<br>
The UV-cure resin composition of the present invention can be suitably used as an adhesive for a bonded optical disk in which silver or a silver alloy is used for a translucent reflection film or a total reflection film. Specifically, the UV-cure resin composition of the present invention is applied by any method such as a spin coating method, a 2P method, a roll coating method and a screen printing method, and two optical disk substrates are bonded so that the film thickness<br>
of an adhesive layer is 1 to 100 \xm after bonding, and then by irradiating with ultraviolet to near ultraviolet rays from one or both sides, the adhesive layer is cured to bond the substrates. The irradiation amount is preferably 50 to 1000 mJ/cm2, particularly preferably 100 to 700 mJ/cm2. For curing by irradiation with ultraviolet to near ultraviolet rays, the light source is not particularly limited as long as it is a lamp which can emit ultraviolet to near ultraviolet rays . For example, a low pressure, high pressure or ultra-high pressure mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, a (pulse) xenon lamp or an electrodeless lamp may be used.<br>
The optical di.sk. to be bonded include those using silver or a silver alloy as a translucent reflection film and silver or a silver alloy as a reflection film, and those using silver<br><br>
or a silver alloy as a total reflection film (for single layer type), and in addition to these, the composition can also be used for those using gold, silicon or a silicon compound as a translucent reflection film and aluminum or an aluminum alloy and silver or a silver alloy as a total reflection film. When used for a single layer type, the UV-cure resin composition of the present invention may be applied onto a total reflection film using silver or silver alloy without forming a protective film to bond a blank substrate (having no reflection film).<br>
The substrate of an optical disk includes total reflection film substrates and translucent reflection film substrates. As a total reflection film substrate, a 0.6 mm thick polycarbonate substrate (hereinafter PC substrate) to which aluminum, an aluminum alloy, silver or a silver alloy is sputtered (deposited) in a film thickness of 35 to 60 nm (nanometer) can be used. As a translucent reflection film, a 0. 6 mm thick PC substrate to which gold, silicon or a silicon alloy and silver or a silver alloy are sputtered (deposited) in a film thickness of 5 to 20 nm can be used.<br>
The UV-cure resin composition of the present invention has an excellent effect that, in a bonded optical disk obtained by adhering a translucent reflection film comprising silver or a silver alloy, voids (air bubbles) are not included when bonding by an optical disk manufacturing apparatus, the durability of the obtained optical disk is equivalent to those of optical disks in which gold is used as a translucent<br><br>
reflection film and the degradation in reflectance caused by exposure to sunlight for a long time can be suppressed.<br>
In the present invention, the experiment of long time exposure to sunlight of an optical disk bonded by using the UV-cure resin composition was conducted by using XENON WZATHER-OMETER Ci-4000 made by Atlas Material Testing Technology LLC. The reflectance of silver or a silver alloy translucent reflection film after the experiment was measured by DVD-2000 made by AECO Ltd. For DVD-9, the standard of the reflectance of a translucent reflection film defined in that industry is not less than 18%.<br>
