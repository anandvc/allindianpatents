EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS FOR UPGRADING OIL<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to equipment and process<br>
for upgrading oil to enable production of a lighter refined<br>
oil from a heavier material oil.<br>
Prior art<br>
[0002]<br>
There is a trend toward lighter products in worldwide<br>
oil situations in recent years.  So-called light oils (light<br>
hydrocarbon oils), such as a gasoline, a heating oil, and a<br>
gas oil, can be obtained not only by means of distillation of<br>
oil, such as atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation,<br>
but also by cracking so-called heavy oils (heavy hydrocarbon<br>
oils) . The process of obtaining a light oil from a heavy oil<br>
includes catalytic cracking by which a heavy oil is cracked<br>
using a catalyst, hydro-cracking by which a heavy oil is cracked<br>
using a catalyst in a hydrogen gas stream with the addition<br>
of hydrogen, thermal cracking by which a heavy oil is thermally<br>
cracked without using a catalyst, and so forth (see, for example,<br>
Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2).<br><br>
[0003]<br>
In addition to the need for a catalyst, catalytic<br>
cracking and hydro-cracking require regeneration processing<br>
of the catalyst because the catalyst becomes inactive with<br>
catalytic cracking of a heavy oil. Further, hydro-cracking<br>
requires strict production conditions at a temperature of 500°C<br>
or above and a pressure of 30 to 100 atmospheres.  Thermal<br>
cracking also requires strict production conditions at a<br>
temperature of 400°C to 500°C and a pressure of 2 to 30<br>
atmospheres.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0004]<br>
The present invention has worked out in view of the<br>
above-mentioned problems, and has an object to provide<br>
equipment and process for upgrading oil which can produce a<br>
refined oil lighter than a material oil by cracking the heavier<br>
material oil with the addition of hydrogen under more relaxed<br>
production conditions than those in the prior art without using<br>
a catalyst, that is, without the need for regeneration<br>
processing of a catalyst.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
Equipment and process for upgrading oil to produce a<br>
lighter refined oil from a heavier material oil according to<br>
an aspect of the invention makes an emulsion by emulsifying<br>
ionized alkaline water in the material oil and dropping<br>
droplets of the emulsion onto the surface of a heated heat<br>
medium.<br>
[0006]<br>
With the equipment and process for upgrading oil, it is<br>
possible to obtain a lighter refined oil from a heavier material<br>
oil under more relaxed production conditions than those in the<br>
prior art.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described with<br>
reference to the drawings.  Components labeled with the same<br>
reference numerals in the respective drawings denote the same<br>
components and descriptions thereof are not repeated herein.<br>
[0009]<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a configuration of an<br>
equipment for upgrading oil of this embodiment. As is shown<br>
in FIG. 1, which is a schematic diagram, an equipment 1A for<br>
upgrading oil is an equipment that produces a lighter refined<br>
oil 03 from a heavier material oil O1 by making an emulsion<br>
E by emulsifying ionized alkaline water A in the material oil<br>
Ol first and then dropping droplets D of the emulsion E onto<br>
the surface S of a heated heat medium O2. The equipment 1A<br>
for upgrading oil comprises, for example, an emulsion making<br>
portion 10, a refinery tank portion 20, a heating portion 30,<br><br>
and a refined oil processing portion 40.<br>
[0010]<br>
The emulsion making portion 10 is an apparatus that makes<br>
the emulsion E by emulsifying the ionized alkaline water A in<br>
the heavier material oil 01.  The emulsion making portion 10<br>
is brought into communication with the refinery tank portion<br>
20 so that droplets D of the produced emulsion E drop onto the<br>
surface S of the heat medium 02.  The emulsion E is of a<br>
water-in-oil type in which fine particles making up the ionized<br>
alkaline water A are dispersed in the material oil Ol.<br>
[0011]<br>
The emulsion making portion 10 as above includes, for<br>
example, a water tank 11, a material oil tank 12, tubes 13 and<br>
14, pumps 15 and 16, and a mixer 17. The water tank 11 is a<br>
reservoir for storing the ionized alkaline water A.  The water<br>
tank 11 is connected to the mixer 17 via the tube 13 so that<br>
the ionized alkaline water A is flown out from the water tank<br>
11 to the mixer 17.  The tube 13 is provided with the pump 15<br>
and the pump 15 causes the ionized alkaline water A to be flown<br>
out from the water tank 11 to the mixer 17 while adjusting a<br>
flow rate. The material oil tank 12 is a reservoir for storing<br>
the material oil 01. The material oil tank 12 is connected<br>
to the mixer 17 via the tube 14 so that the material oil 01<br>
is flown out from the material oil tank 12 to the mixer 17.<br>
The tube 14 is provided with the pump 16 and the pump 16 causes<br><br>
the material oil 01 to be flown out from the material oil tank<br>
12 to the mixer 17 while adjusting a flow rate.  The mixer 17<br>
is a device that mixes the ionized alkaline water A and the<br>
material oil O1 flown therein.  The ionized alkaline water A<br>
is emulsified in the material oil 01 by this mixing and the<br>
water-in-oil emulsion E is thus produced in the mixer 17. The<br>
mixer 17 includes a dropping opening portion 171 that forms<br>
the droplets D of the emulsion E and drops them into the refinery-<br>
tank portion 20.<br>
[0012]<br>
The refinery tank portion 20 is a reservoir configured<br>
not only to store the heat medium O2 but also to introduce the<br>
droplets D of the emulsion E made in the emulsion making portion<br>
10 so that the droplets D of the emulsion E are dropped onto<br>
the surface S of the heat medium 02 . As will be described below,<br>
the refined oil 03 is produced as the droplets D of the emulsion<br>
E are dropped onto the surface S of the heat medium O2. The<br>
refinery tank portion 20 is brought into communication with<br>
the refined oil processing portion 40 so that the refined oil<br>
03 is flown out to the refined oil processing portion 40.  The<br>
refinery tank portion 20 includes, for example, a metal<br>
reservoir of a circular cylindrical shape having a bottom 21<br>
and a lid 22 and a relatively large internal volume. An<br>
introduction inlet portion 24 and an introduction outlet<br>
portion 25 are made in the lid 22. The introduction inlet<br><br>
portion 24 is an opening portion to introduce the droplets D<br>
of the emulsion E made in the emulsion making portion 10 to<br>
the inside so that the droplets D of the emulsion E are dropped<br>
onto the surface S of the heat medium 02 and it is connected<br>
to the dropping opening portion 171 of the mixer 17 in the<br>
emulsion making portion 10.  The introduction outlet portion<br>
25 is an opening portion to introduce the refined oil O3 that<br>
is lighter than the material oil Ol to the outside.<br>
[0013]<br>
The heating portion 30 is an apparatus that heats the<br>
refinery tank portion 20.  The heat medium 02 is heated as the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 is heated.  The heating portion 30<br>
is provided, for example, with a burner 32 at one end portion<br>
and includes a heating gas duct portion 31 in which is flown<br>
a hot combustion gas generated by burning a fuel oil by the<br>
burner 32.  The heating portion 30 heats the bottom 21 of the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 by letting the hot combustion gas<br>
generated by burning the fuel oil by the burner 32 flow through<br>
the heating gas duct portion 31. Accordingly, heat of the<br>
combustion gas is transferred to the heat medium 02 via the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 by heat conduction and the heat medium<br>
02 is heated, which induces a convection. As the fuel oil for<br>
the burner 32, for example, a heavy oil fuel, such as an<br>
inexpensive fuel oil C, is used.<br>
[0014]<br><br>
The refined oil processing portion 40 is a reservoir for<br>
collecting and storing the refined oil 03 produced in the<br>
refinery tank portion 20. The refined oil processing portion<br>
40 includes an introduction inlet portion 41 and an atmospheric<br>
opening portion 42- The introduction inlet portion 41 is an<br>
opening portion to introduce the refined oil 03 produced in<br>
the refinery tank 20 to the inside and is connected to the<br>
introduction outlet portion 25 of the refinery tank portion<br>
20. The atmospheric opening portion 42 is an opening portion<br>
through which atmospheric air flows in and out freely and it<br>
is open to the atmosphere. The generation tank portion 20<br>
communicating with the refined oil processing portion 40 is<br>
consequently brought into a state open to the atmosphere. The<br>
inside of the refinery tank portion 20 is thus almost at a<br>
pressure of the atmosphere. The refined oil processing<br>
portion 40 includes, for example, a condenser to condense a<br>
gas of the refined oil O3 into a liquid and a storage tank to<br>
store the liquid of the refined oil O3 condensed by the<br>
condenser. This storage tank is open to the atmosphere.  In<br>
addition, the refined oil processing portion 40 includes, for<br>
example, a fractionating column to fractionate the refined oil<br>
O3. a condenser to condense a gas of oil fractionated in the<br>
fractionating column into a liquid, and a storage tank to store<br>
the liquid of oil condensed by the condenser. This storage<br>
tank is open to the atmosphere. Because the condenser<br>
8<br><br>
condenses a gas of oil to a liquid, a pressure varies inside<br>
the refinery tank portion 20 communicating with the refined<br>
oil processing portion 40. The variance in pressure, however,<br>
is of the order of ±1/100. The inside of the refinery tank<br>
portion 20 is therefore almost at a pressure of the atmosphere<br>
in this case, too.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the equipment 1A for upgrading oil configured as above,<br>
the ionized alkaline water A is fed and stored in the water<br>
tank 11 first, then the heavier material oil 01 is fed and stored<br>
in the material oil tank 12, and the heat medium 02 in an amount<br>
sufficient to form the liquid surface S is fed and stored in<br>
the refinery tank portion 20.<br>
[0016]<br>
The ionized alkaline water A is ionized alkaline water<br>
containing calcium ions (Ca2+), and it is an aqueous solution<br>
of calcium produced by mixing an aqueous solution of calcium<br>
hydroxide (Ca(0H)2), water, and calcium (Ca).  The ionized<br>
alkaline water A containing calcium ions is adjusted to have<br>
the oxidation-reduction potential of -850 mV or below, so that<br>
water molecules are readily cracked into oxygen atoms and<br>
hydrogen atoms by a phreatic explosion described below through<br>
activation of hydrogen. Also, it is adjusted to have a pH of<br>
12 or higher so that a hydrogenation reaction described below<br>
takes place efficiently by bringing active hydrogen produced<br><br>
by adjustment of the oxidation-reduction potential and<br>
cavitation described below in a relatively stable state. As<br>
has been described, the ionized alkaline water A contains<br>
calcium ions and is adjusted to have the oxidation-reduction<br>
potential of -850 mV or below and the pH of 12 or higher.  It<br>
is therefore possible to obtain a lighter refined oil<br>
effectively from a heavier material oil.<br>
[0017]<br>
The material oil 01 in the material oil tank 12 may be<br>
any heavy oil as long as it can produce the water-in-oil<br>
emulsion E when mixed by the mixer 17 and form the droplets<br>
D.  Examples include but not limited to a crude oil, an<br>
atmospheric distillation residue, a vacuum distillation<br>
residue, a thermal cracking residue, a coal tar, a fuel oil<br>
A, a fuel oil B, and a fuel oil C.  These heavy oils may be<br>
used as the material oil 01 either solely or in the form of<br>
a mixture of two or more kinds of these heavy oils.<br>
Alternatively, these heavy oils partially mixed with a light<br>
oil may be used as the material oil 01.<br>
[0018]<br>
As will be described below, the heat medium 02 is a medium<br>
that transfers heat to the droplets D of the emulsion E dropped<br>
onto the surface S thereof, and it may be any oil (hydrocarbon<br>
oil) as long as it is in a liquid state when heated to a specific<br>
temperature by the heating portion 30. Because it is heated<br><br>
to about 250 to 400°C in this embodiment, for example, a heavy<br>
oil, such as a fuel oil, is used.<br>
[0019]<br>
Subsequently, the heating portion 30 is activated. The<br>
refinery tank portion 20 is heated by the heating portion 30<br>
and so is the heat medium 02 in the refinery tank portion 20.<br>
The heat medium 02 is thus heated to about 250 to 400°C. In<br>
addition, because a heavy oil is used as the heat medium O2<br>
in this embodiment, part of the heat medium 02 vaporizes as<br>
the heat medium 02 is heated. Accordingly, the inside of the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 turns into a gas atmosphere containing<br>
the vaporized heat medium 02 at a temperature corresponding<br>
to the temperature of the heat medium 02 stored in the refinery<br>
tank portion 20.<br>
[0020]<br>
Subsequently, each of the pump 15 and the pump 16 is<br>
activated. The ionized alkaline water A is thus flown out from<br>
the water tank 11 to the mixer 17 and at the same time the<br>
material oil Ol is flown out from the material oil tank 12 to<br>
the mixer 17. The mixer 17 is then activated to mix the ionized<br>
alkaline water A and the material oil Ol flown therein. The<br>
water-in-oil emulsion E is thus produced. A particle size of<br>
fine particles making up the ionized alkaline water A dispersed<br>
in the emulsion E is normally 10 μm or smaller, and preferably<br>
3 to 5 μm. A particle size of water smaller than 3 μm is not<br><br><br>
preferable because cavitation is generated insufficiently in<br>
this case, and a particle size of water larger than 5 μm is<br>
not preferable, either, because cavitation is generated<br>
insufficiently in this case, too.<br>
[0021]<br>
The emulsion E produced by the mixer 17 is formed in the<br>
shape of drops, which are dropped, as the droplets D, from the<br>
introduction inlet portion 24 toward the surface S of the heat<br>
medium O2 in the refinery tank portion 20. The droplets D thus<br>
dropped react with the heat medium O2 to produce the refined<br>
oil O3 lighter than the material oil Ol.<br>
[0022]<br>
As to the process by which the dropped droplets D produce<br>
the lighter refined oil 03 from the heavier material oil 01,<br>
the inventor makes the inference as follows.  Specifically,<br>
the droplets D of the emulsion E introduced inside from the<br>
introduction inlet portion 24 are heated up by heat from the<br>
gas in the refinery tank 20 .  The material oil Ol in the emulsion<br>
E is thus heated and the ionized alkaline water A which is in<br>
the form of fine particles is heated via the material oil Ol.<br>
The droplets D of the emulsion E become finer as the droplets<br>
D separate by this heating while they are falling down.<br>
Meanwhile, the ionized alkaline water A made up of fine<br>
particles reaches the boiling point first and vaporizes.<br>
Although the vaporized ionized alkaline water A is to expand.<br><br><br>
such expansion is prevented by a tensile force of the<br>
surrounding oil film, which causes the energy to accumulate.<br>
The droplets D of the emulsion E fall down further and they<br>
are heated at once when they reach the surface of the heat medium<br>
O2.  This heating causes the vaporized ionized alkaline water<br>
A to expand at once and the pressure induced by this expansion<br>
exceeds the limit of the tensile force of the surrounding oil<br>
film, which gives rise to a micro explosion caused by a phreatic<br>
explosion.  In this instance, the material oil O1 in the<br>
droplets D scatters and the surface area is enlarged by several<br>
thousand times (for example, 5000 times) at once.  The heating<br>
is thus accelerated.  In addition, cavitation is generated in<br>
the heat medium O2 by the micro explosion. The cavitation<br>
raises the temperature in a microscopic fraction of the heat<br>
medium 02 having undergone the micro explosion to about 10000°C<br>
and the pressure wave of the cavitation rises to about 350<br>
atmospheres .  Cracking occurs consequently in the material oil<br>
Ol and the water molecules of the ionized alkaline water are<br>
cracked into oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms. Chemically<br>
active hydrogen atoms produced by the cracking of water<br>
molecules bind to binding bonds of cleaved carbon atoms<br>
produced by the cracking. Hydrogen is thus added to the<br>
material oil Ol. Further, chemically active oxygen atoms<br>
produced by the cracking of water molecules bind to binding<br>
bonds of cleaved carbon atoms produced by the cracking. Oxygen,<br><br>
too, is thus added to the material oil 01. The refined oil<br>
03 lighter than the heavier material oil 01 is produced in this<br>
manner. Further, the refined oil 03 contains more oxygen than<br>
the material oil Ol. The above is the inference made by the<br>
inventor as to the process by which the dropped droplets D<br>
produce the lighter refined oil O3 from the heavier material<br>
oil Ol.<br>
[0023]<br>
Accordingly, the proportion of the weight of water in<br>
the ionized alkaline water in relative to the weight of the<br>
material oil Ol in the emulsion E, weight of water/(weight of<br>
material oil Ol) x 100, is determined by a difference between<br>
the hydrogen content in the material oil Ol and the hydrogen<br>
content in the light oil to be produced.  The water content<br>
is higher in the material oil 01 having a higher specific<br>
gravity and it is preferably 5 to 30 wt%.  In terms of upgrading<br>
oil, a proportion of water lower than 5 wt% is not preferable<br>
because hydrogen atoms become insufficient in this case. A<br>
proportion of water higher than 30 wt% is not preferable, either,<br>
because the water content becomes excessively high in this case.<br>
In order to produce the emulsion E at the proportion specified<br>
above by the mixer 17, the ionized alkaline water A is flown<br>
out from the water tank 11 to the mixer 17 while the flow rate<br>
is adjusted by the pump 15 and the material oil 01 is flown<br>
out from the material oil tank 12 to the mixer 17 while the<br><br>
flow rate is adjusted by the pump 16.<br>
[0024]<br>
The light refined oil 03 thus produced is introduced out<br>
from the introduction outlet portion 25 and collected and<br>
stored in the refined oil processing portion 40 provided at<br>
the introduction outlet portion 25.<br>
[0025]<br>
In this manner, it is possible to obtain the lighter<br>
refined oil 03 from the heavier material oil 01 by the equipment<br>
1A for upgrading oil.  In the equipment 1A for upgrading oil<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention, the temperature<br>
of the heat medium 02 is about 2 50 to 400°C and the production<br>
conditions are more relaxed than those in the prior art. A<br>
material having lower heat resistance than that in the prior<br>
art can be therefore adopted for the refinery tank portion 20.<br>
Further, in the equipment 1A for upgrading oil described as<br>
above, the refinery tank portion 20 is open to the atmosphere<br>
and the production conditions are relaxed further than those<br>
in the prior art. The strength of the refinery tank portion<br>
20 can be therefore lower than that in the prior art, which<br>
allows the refinery tank portion 20 to adopt a simpler structure<br>
than that in the prior art. In addition, because it is not<br>
necessary to use a catalyst used in catalytic cracking and<br>
hydro-cracking in the equipment 1A for upgrading oil described<br>
above, the need for the regeneration processing of a catalyst<br><br>
can be eliminated.<br>
[0026]<br>
The heat medium 02 is an oil, particularly, a heavy oil<br>
in this embodiment.  Hence, cracking occurs in part of the oil<br>
forming the heat medium O2 when cracking occurs in the raw<br>
material 01, and hydrogen is added to the heat medium 02 .  Part<br>
of the oil forming the heat medium 02 is thus converted into<br>
a light oil, which flows from the refinery tank portion 20 to<br>
the refined oil processing portion 40 and is consumed<br>
eventually.  It is therefore necessary to replenish the heat<br>
medium 02 as needed while the equipment 1A for upgrading oil<br>
is operating for a hydrogenation reaction to take place in a<br>
satisfactory manner.<br>
[0027]<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram showing a configuration of a heating<br>
portion of another equipment for upgrading oil of this<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the embodiment described above, the equipment 1A for<br>
upgrading oil is configured so as to heat the heat medium 02<br>
in the refinery tank portion 20.  However, the equipment for<br>
upgrading oil may be configured so as to heat a gas in the<br>
refinery tank 20 as well. An equipment 1B for upgrading oil<br>
configured as above includes a heating portion 50 shown in FIG.<br>
2, which is a schematic diagram, instead of the heating portion<br><br>
30 of the equipment 1A for upgrading oil shown in FIG. 1.  The<br>
heating portion 50 is provided, for example, with a burner 52<br>
at one end portion and includes a heating gas duct portion 51<br>
in which is flown a hot combustion gas generated by burning<br>
a fuel oil by the burner 52.  The heating gas duct portion 51<br>
is formed by including a bottom surface heating portion 511<br>
extending almost horizontally along the bottom 21 of the<br>
refinery tank portion 2 0 and a side surface heating portion<br>
512 communicating with the bottom surface heating portion 511<br>
and extending upward almost perpendicularly along the side wall<br>
23 of the refinery tank portion 20.  The side surface heating<br>
portion 512 is bent upward almost at a right angle while<br>
communicating with the bottom surface heating portion 511.<br>
The emulsion making portion 10, the refinery tank portion 20,<br>
and the refined oil processing portion 40 of the equipment 1B<br>
for upgrading oil are the same as the corresponding<br>
counterparts described above, and descriptions thereof are<br>
omitted herein. The heating portion 50 configured as above<br>
heats the bottom 21 of the refinery tank portion 20 by letting<br>
a hot combustion gas generated by burning a fuel oil by the<br>
burner 52 flow through the bottom surface heating portion 511.<br>
Heat of the combustion gas is thus transferred to the heat<br>
medium O2 via the refinery tank portion 20 by heat conduction,<br>
and the heat medium 02 is heated. The heating portion 50 heats<br>
the side wall 23 of the refinery tank portion 20 by letting<br><br>
the combustion gas flow from the bottom surface heating portion<br>
511 to the side surface heating portion 512. Heat of the<br>
combustion gas is thus transferred to a gas in the refinery<br>
tank portion 20 via the refinery tank portion 20 by heat<br>
conduction.  The heating portion 50 is therefore capable of<br>
heating the gas in the refinery tank portion 20 as well.<br>
[0029]<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram showing a configuration of a refinery<br>
tank portion and a heating portion of still another equipment<br>
for upgrading oil according to the embodiment.  In the<br>
embodiment described above, as is shown in FIG. 3, which is<br>
a schematic diagram, an equipment 1C for upgrading oil may be<br>
formed using a heating portion 70 and a refinery tank portion<br>
60 in which the heat medium 02 circulates with the heating by<br>
the heating portion 70 instead of using the heating portion<br>
30 and the refinery tank portion 20 of the equipment 1A for<br>
upgrading oil shown in FIG. 1.  Referring to FIG. 3. the<br>
refinery tank portion 60 is a reservoir formed in the shape<br>
of a closed loop in which the heat medium 02 is allowed to<br>
circulate up and down. The heating portion 70 is provided,<br>
for example, with a burner 72 at one end portion and includes<br>
a heating gas duct portion 71 in which is flown a hot combustion<br>
gas generated by burning a fuel oil by the burner 72.  The<br>
heating gas duct portion 71 is formed by including a lower<br>
heating portion 711 that heats the heat medium 02 in a closed<br><br>
loop lower portion 61 of the refinery tank portion 60 and a<br>
side heating portion 712 that communicates with the lower<br>
heating portion 711 and heats the heat medium 02 that is heated<br>
by the lower heating portion 711 and thereby coming up in a<br>
closed loop side portion 62 of the refinery tank portion 60.<br>
[0030]<br>
More specifically, the refinery tank portion 60 includes<br>
a lower storage portion 111 having a relatively large internal<br>
volume at the lower potion thereof.  The lower storage portion<br>
111 forms the lower end portion of the closed loop and<br>
corresponds to the closed loop lower portion 61.<br>
[0031]<br>
As is shown in PIG. 3, the lower storage portion 111 is<br>
provided with a first side portion 112 extending upward from<br>
one end side (left side in FIG. 3) in the top surface portion<br>
and a second side portion 113 extending upward from the other<br>
end side (right side in FIG. 3) in the top surface portion.<br>
The first side portion 112 includes a heat transfer tube portion<br>
114 formed of a large number of heat transfer tubes 114a each<br>
being made of a pipe and a confluent portion 115 provided at<br>
the upper end portion of the heat transfer tube portion 114.<br>
[0032]<br>
The heat transfer tube portion 114 is connected to the<br>
top surface portion of the lower storage portion 111 at the<br>
lower end portion and each heat transfer tube 114a extends<br><br>
vertically.  The interior of each heat transfer tube 114a is<br>
brought into communication with the interior of the lower<br>
storage portion 111 via a communication hole formed in the top<br>
surface of the lower storage portion 111.  The confluent<br>
portion 115 lies over all the heat transfer tubes 114a. The<br>
heat media O2 flowing out from the upper end of each heat<br>
transfer tube 114a joins at the confluent portion 115.  The<br>
closed loop side portion 62 includes the heat transfer tube<br>
portion 114 and the confluent portion 115.  In short, the heat<br>
transfer tube portion 114 and the confluent portion 115 form<br>
one side portion of the closed loop.<br>
[0033]<br>
Meanwhile, the second side portion 113 forms, for example,<br>
a circular cylindrical shape. An upper storage portion 117<br>
connects the second side portion 113 and the confluent portion<br>
115 above the bottom storage portion 111. A space which is<br>
surrounded by the lower storage portion 111, the first side<br>
portion 112, the second side portion 113, and the upper storage<br>
portion 117 makes a penetrating space that penetrates through<br>
the sheet surface in the depth direction. The upper storage<br>
portion 117 forms, for example, a circular cylindrical shape<br>
and inclines slightly downward from the first side portion 112<br>
to the second side portion 113. The upper storage portion 117<br>
serves as the upper end portion of the closed loop.<br>
[0034]<br><br>
The confluent portion 115 and the second side portion<br>
113 are communicated with each other via the upper storage<br>
portion 117. The second side portion 113 is communicated with<br>
the lower storage portion 111 via a communication hole made<br>
in the top surface portion of the lower storage portion 111.<br>
In this manner, the interior of the refinery tank portion 60<br>
is formed in a closed loop in which the lower storage portion<br>
111, the first side portion 112, the second side portion 113,<br>
and the upper storage portion 117 communicate with each other.<br>
The heat medium O2 is therefore allowed to circulate up and<br>
down in the refinery tank portion 60.  In short, the interior<br>
of the refinery tank portion 60 forms a closed circuit as a<br>
whole serving as a circulation channel for a thermal convection.<br>
In this embodiment, the upper storage portion 117 and the second<br>
side portion 113 together form a circulating portion. Namely,<br>
the heat medium O2 flowing out from the first side portion 112<br>
flows to the lower storage portion 111 through the upper storage<br>
portion 117 and the second side portion 113.  In this embodiment,<br>
the refinery tank portion 60 is formed one system with the lower<br>
storage portion 111, the first side portion 112, the second<br>
side portion 113, and the upper storage portion 117. The heat<br>
medium 02 is therefore stored thoroughly in these lower storage<br>
portion 111, first side portion 112, second side portion 113,<br>
and upper storage portion 117.<br>
[0035]<br><br>
The heating portion 70 is provided with the heating gas<br>
duct, portion 71 in which is flown a combustion gas that heats<br>
the heat medium 02 in the refinery tank portion 60 . The heating<br>
gas duct portion 71 includes the lower heating portion 711,<br>
the side heating portion 712, and a connecting portion 713 that<br>
connects the both heating portions 711 and 712.<br>
[0036]<br>
The lower heating portion 711 is to heat the heat medium<br>
O2 in the lower storage portion 111 and includes an outer<br>
heating portion 715 provided on the outside of the refinery<br>
tank portion 60 and an inner heating portion 716 provided on<br>
the inside of the refinery tank portion 60.  The outer heating<br>
portion 715 is provided with a burner 72 at the end portion<br>
and is formed of an introduction portion 715a extending almost<br>
horizontally, a bottom surface heating portion 715b<br>
communicating with the downstream end of the introduction<br>
portion 715a and extending almost horizontally along the bottom<br>
surface 611 of the refinery tank portion 60, and a connecting<br>
portion 715c communicating with the downstream end of the<br>
bottom surface heating portion 715b and extending upward along<br>
the side wall 612 of the lower storage portion 111. The<br>
exterior wall of the outer heating portion 715 is formed with<br>
a fire-resistant heat insulator for preventing the radiation<br>
of heat of the combustion gas flowing inside the outer heating<br>
portion 715.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
A combustion gas is generated by burning the burner 72<br>
and the combustion gas flows through the introduction portion<br>
715a, the bottom surface heating portion 715b, and the<br>
connecting portion 715c. At this time, heat of the combustion<br>
gas is transferred to the heat medium O2 in the lower storage<br>
portion 111 via the bottom surface 611 of the refinery tank<br>
portion 60 at the bottom heating portion 715b.  In other words,<br>
the bottom surface 611 of the refinery tank portion 60 serves<br>
as a heat transfer surface that transfers the heat of the<br>
combustion gas to the heat medium 02.<br>
[0038]<br>
The inner heating portion 716 is disposed inside the<br>
lower storage portion 111 and formed of plural U tubes 716a.<br>
Each U tube 716a is fixed to the side wall 612 on one side (left<br>
side in FIG. 3) of the lower storage portion 111 so that the<br>
both ends of the tube are disposed at top and bottom and provided<br>
also to extend horizontally from the side wall 612 toward the<br>
opposite side wall 613.  The curved portion of the U tube 716a<br>
is disposed near the opposite side wall 613. By providing the<br>
curved portion in a state spaced apart from the side wall 613,<br>
even when the U tubes 716a undergo thermal expansion, it is<br>
possible to control heat stress of the U tubes 716a.<br>
[0039]<br>
One end on the lower side of the U tube 716a is<br><br>
communicated with the connecting portion 715c via a<br>
communication hole made in the side wall 612. Meanwhile, one<br>
end on the upper side of the U tube 716a is communicated with<br>
the communicating portion 713 via a communication hole made<br>
in the side wall 612. The communication portion 713 is<br>
communicated with the U tubes 716a at the lower end and is<br>
provided on the outside of the refinery tank portion 60. The<br>
communicating portion 713 is communicated with the lower end<br>
of the side heating portion 712 at the upper end portion. The<br>
communicating portion 713 is covered with a heat insulator.<br>
[0040]<br>
The side heating portion 712 is adapted for heating the<br>
heat medium 02 in the first side portion 112, and is provided<br>
to surround the heat transfer tube portion 114, for example,<br>
of a circular cylindrical member extending upward along the<br>
first side portion 112 from the lower end portion of the first<br>
side portion 112 .  The side heating portion 712 is communicated<br>
with the communicating portion 713 at the lower end.  In other<br>
words, the heat medium 02 in the heat transfer tube portion<br>
114 is heated by a combustion gas flowing upward on the outside<br>
of the heat transfer tubes 114a in the side heating portion<br>
712.<br>
[0041]<br>
The refinery tank portion 60 is provided with an<br>
unillustrated level detector (for example, a level sensor) to<br><br>
detect the liquid surface S of the heat medium O2 stored therein,<br>
The level detector is provided, for example, to the upper end<br>
portion of the second side portion 113.  It is provided so as<br>
to control a heating amount of the heating portion 70 and a<br>
feed amount of the heat medium 02 to be fed from an unillustrated<br>
feeding portion in such a manner that an amount of the heat<br>
medium O2 in the refinery tank portion 60 falls within a range<br>
for keeping the liquid surface S of the heat medium 02 on the<br>
upper side of the second side portion 113 and for keeping a<br>
normal circulation.<br>
[0042]<br>
Also, the refinery tank portion 60 is provided with an<br>
exhausting tube 118 for exhausting the remaining materials in<br>
the refinery tank portion 60. The exhausting tube 118 is<br>
provided at the lower end portion of the lower storage portion<br>
111 and used to exhaust the heat medium O2 (oil content in this<br>
embodiment) remaining at the bottom of the tank.<br>
[0043]<br>
The refined oil processing portion 40 is provided at the<br>
upper end portion of the first side portion 112 and the emulsion<br>
making portion 10 is provided at the upper end portion of the<br>
second side portion 113. The emulsion making portion 10 is<br>
provided so that the droplets D of the emulsion E are dropped<br>
onto the surface S of the heat medium 02 that streams down in<br>
the second side portion 113 of the refinery tank portion 60.<br><br>
The emulsion making portion 10 and the refined oil processing<br>
portion 40 of the equipment 1C for upgrading oil are the same<br>
as the corresponding counterparts described above and<br>
descriptions thereof are omitted herein.<br>
[0044]<br>
In this equipment 1C for upgrading oil configured as<br>
above, the refined oil O3 is produced from the material oil<br>
01 as the droplets D of the emulsion E are dropped onto the<br>
surface S of the heat medium O2 that streams down in the second<br>
side portion 113.<br>
[0045]<br>
More specifically, in the equipment 1C for upgrading oil,<br>
the ionized alkaline water A is first fed and stored in the<br>
water tank 11, then the heavier material oil Ol is fed and stored<br>
in the material oil tank 12, and the heat medium O2 in an amount<br>
sufficient to form the liquid surface S is fed and stored in<br>
the refinery tank portion 20.  Subsequently, the heating<br>
portion 70 starts to work and the interior of the refinery tank<br>
portion 60 is heated by a combustion gas, for example, at about<br>
700 to 800°C generated by burning the burner 72.  In other words,<br>
the combustion gas from the burner 72 flows through the<br>
introduction portion 715a, after which it heats the refinery<br>
tank portion bottom surface 611 in the bottom surface heating<br>
portion 715b and flows into the inner heating portion 716<br>
through the connecting portion 715c.  In the inner heating<br><br>
portion 716, the combustion gas heats the heat medium 02 in<br>
the lower storage portion 111 and flows into the side heating<br>
portion 712 through the communication portion 713.  In the side<br>
heating portion 712, the combustion gas heats the heat medium<br>
02 in the first side portion 112 and is then exhausted.<br>
Meanwhile, in the refinery tank portion 60, the heat medium<br>
O2 heated by the combustion gas in the lower storage portion<br>
111 comes up and flows into the respective heat transfer tubes<br>
114a of the heat transfer tube portion 114.  The heat medium<br>
O2 is heated in the heat transfer tubes 114a to the temperature<br>
that it comes to a boil in part.  Accordingly, it turns into<br>
a gas-liquid mixing fluid having a low density in general<br>
average in the heat transfer tubes 114a and generates an intense<br>
upward flow.  This generates a fast circulating flow in the<br>
refinery tank portion 60 , in which the heat medium O2 circulates<br>
through the lower storage portion 111, the first side portion<br>
112, the upper storage portion 117, and the second side portion<br>
113 sequentially in this order.  Hence, because the heat medium<br>
O2 comes down at a high speed in the second side portion 113,<br>
a cone-shaped swirl is being formed on the surface S of the<br>
heat medium 02 in the second side portion 113.  When the<br>
droplets D of the emulsion E made in the refinery tank portion<br>
20 are dropped onto the surface S on which the swirl is being<br>
formed, the droplets D are drawn into the swirl.  Heat is<br>
transferred to the droplets D from the heat medium 02 while<br><br>
they are coining down in the second side portion 113 together<br>
with the heat medium 02, therefore, the droplets D are heated<br>
up at once.  The droplets D thus undergo a micro explosion while<br>
coming down in the second side portion 113 and cavitation is<br>
generated.  Also, a micro explosion can occur while the<br>
slightest part of the droplets D flows transversely in the lower<br>
storage portion 111. The material oil O1 is converted to the<br>
lighter refined oil 03 by the cavitation.  The refined oil 03<br>
flows into the first side portion 112 together with the heat<br>
medium O2 and separates from the heat medium O2 toward the upper<br>
side of the first side portion 112, after which it is introduced<br>
into the refined oil processing portion 40 from the upper end<br>
portion of the first side portion 112.  In the equipment 1C<br>
for upgrading oil configured as above, a natural convection<br>
occurs efficiently in the refinery tank portion 60 by the<br>
heating portion 70 as has been described above.  The heating<br>
efficiency of the heat medium O2 can be thus enhanced.<br>
[0046]<br>
An experiment will now be described. Table 1 below is<br>
a table showing results of the experiment for upgrading oil.<br>
Table 2 below is a table showing results of distillation<br>
analysis on the material oil. Table 3 below is a table showing<br>
results of distillation analysis on the refined oil.  Table<br>
4 below is a table showing results of analysis on the density,<br>
the flash point, and the sulfur content of the material oil.<br><br>
Table 5 below is a table showing results of analysis on the<br>
density, the flash point, and the sulfur content of the refined<br>
oil.<br><br><br><br><br>

[0051]<br>
[Table 5]<br>
Result of Analysis on Density, Flash Point, and<br>
Sulfur Content of Refined oil<br><br>
[0052]<br>
Initially, 11.00 kg (Table 1 above) of ionized alkaline<br>
water, which contained calcium ions and was adjusted to have<br>
the oxidation-reduction potential of -850 mV or below and a<br>
pH of 12 or higher, was fed and stored in the water tank 11.<br>
[0053]<br>
As is set forth in Table 1 above, the material oil Ol,<br>
which is a mixture oil of 32.00 kg of fuel oil C, 4.63 kg of<br>
fuel oil A, and 20.02 kg of kerosene, was fed and stored in<br>
the material oil tank 12 . According to analysis on the material<br>
oil Ol made by Marine &amp; Oil Surveyors Co., Ltd. (2-9-1,<br>
Motomachi-Dori, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan), the results are<br>
shown in Table 2 and Table 4. According to Table 2 above, the<br>
temperature rises gradually from 113.7°C to 413.3°C at 5%<br>
distillation to 95% distillation, and according to Table 4<br>
above, the density is 0.9648 at 15°C and the flash point is<br>
77.0°C. Hence, it is confirmed that the material oil Ol is a<br>
heavy oil.  It also contains 2.28 wt% of sulfur.<br><br>
[0054]<br>
At the liquid level forming the liquid surface S, for<br>
example, at about 1/3 depth of the refinery tank portion 20,<br>
the heat medium O2 was fed and stored in the refinery tank<br>
portion 20.  Subsequently, the heat medium 02 was heated at<br>
the heat portion 30 to about 250 to 400°C.  In this case, the<br>
temperature of a gas (including the vaporized heat medium 02)<br>
inside the refinery tank portion 20 was about 280 to 450°C.<br>
The flow rates of the pumps 15 and 16 were then adjusted for<br>
the emulsion E to be produced from the ionized alkaline water<br>
and the material oil Ol. and the emulsion E was produced by<br>
the mixer 17.  The droplets D of the emulsion E thus produced<br>
were dropped onto the surface of the heat medium O2.<br>
Consequently, 64.24 kg of refined oil (Table 1 above) was<br>
obtained.  In this case, 0.68 kg of residue (Table 1 above)<br>
was remained at the bottom of the refinery tank portion 20,<br>
and substances, such as moisture vapor, the material oil Ol,<br>
and the refined oil O3, flown out from the portion open to the<br>
atmosphere as a loss by evaporation was 2 . 73 kg (Table 1 above) .<br>
[0055]<br>
According to analysis on the refined oil 03 made by Marine<br>
&amp; Oil Surveyors Co., Ltd., the results are shown in Table 3<br>
and Table 5. According to Table 3 above, the temperature rises<br>
gradually at 5% distillation to 95% distillation only in a range<br>
of 157.5°C to 261.0°C. Also, according to Table 5 above, the<br><br>
density is 0.7926 at 15°C and the flash point is 32.5°C.  It<br>
is therefore confirmed that the refined oil 03 is a light oil,<br>
in particular, kerosene.  It is confirmed further that sulfur<br>
reduces to 0.06 wt%.<br>
[0056]<br>
One comparative example will now be described. A<br>
comparison was made in a case where the refined oil 03 is<br>
produced from the material oil Ol using the equipment 1A for<br>
upgrading oil shown in FIG. 1, and in a case where the refined<br>
oil 03 is produced from the material oil 01 by means of the<br>
conventional thermal cracking method using an equipment formed<br>
by omitting the emulsion making portion 10 from the<br>
configuration of the equipment 1A for upgrading oil shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The components forming the material oil 01 were the<br>
same in each case.<br>
[0057]<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram showing refinery temperatures with<br>
elapsed times by an inventive process of upgrading oil and by<br>
a conventional thermal cracking method.  FIG. 5 is a diagram<br>
showing an amount of used fuel with elapsed times by an<br>
inventive process of upgrading oil and by a conventional<br>
thermal cracking method. FIG. 6 is a diagram showing an amount<br>
of refined oil with elapsed times by an inventive process of<br>
upgrading oil and by a conventional thermal cracking method.<br>
The abscissa in FIG. 4 through FIG. 6 is used for the elapsed<br><br>
times since the start of production.  The ordinate in FIG. 4<br>
is used for the temperature (refinery temperature) inside the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 indicated by the unit of °C.  The<br>
ordinate in FIG. 5 is used for an amount of used fuel per unit<br>
time (an amount of used fuel per ten minutes) indicated by the<br>
unit of liter/10 minutes.  The ordinate in FIG. 6 is used for<br>
an amount of refined oil per unit time (an amount of refined<br>
oil per ten minutes) indicated by the unit of litter/10 minutes .<br>
The mark ♦ in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 denotes the refinery temperature<br>
by the inventive process of upgrading oil and the mark ■ in<br>
FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 denotes the refinery temperature by the<br>
conventional thermal cracking method.  Of a pair of bar charts<br>
in FIG. 6, the outline bar chart (on the left side on the sheet<br>
surface) represents an amount of refined oil by the inventive<br>
process of upgrading oil and the hatched bar chart (on the right<br>
side on the sheet surface) represents an amount of refined oil<br>
by the conventional thermal cracking method.<br>
[0058]<br>
As can be understood from FIG. 4, according to the<br>
conventional thermal cracking method, the temperature in the<br>
refinery tank portion 20 in a period from the start of<br>
production to 60 minutes later is in a range of 524°C to 539°C<br>
and the average temperature is 533°C.  On the contrary,<br>
according to the inventive process of upgrading oil, the<br>
temperature in the refinery tank portion 20 is in a range of<br><br>
339°C to 356°C and the average temperature is 347°C. Hence,<br>
the refinery temperature is lower in the case of the inventive<br>
process of upgrading oil than in the case of the conventional<br>
thermal cracking method, and the production conditions are more<br>
relaxed. When the average temperatures are compared, it is<br>
lower by as much as 186°C in the former than in the latter.<br>
[0059]<br>
Consequently, as can be understood from FIG. 5, according<br>
to the conventional thermal cracking method, an amount of used<br>
fuel per ten minutes in a period from the start of production<br>
to 60 minutes later is in a range of 0,9 liter/10 minutes to 1.2<br>
liters/10 minutes and the average amount of used fuel is 1.05<br>
liters/10 minutes. An amount of used fuel for one hour is 6.3<br>
liters. On the contrary, according to the inventive process<br>
of upgrading oil, an amount of used fuel per ten minutes in<br>
a period from the start of production to 60 minutes later is<br>
in a range of 0.4 liter/10 minutes to 0.9 liter/10 minutes and<br>
the average amount of used fuel is 0.7 liter/10 minutes. An<br>
amount of used fuel for one hour is 4.2 liters. Accordingly,<br>
an amount of used fuel is smaller in the case of the inventive<br>
process of upgrading oil than in the case of the conventional<br>
thermal cracking method. When the amounts of used fuel per<br>
unit time are compared using the average amounts of used fuel,<br>
it is smaller by as much as 0.35 liter/10 minutes in the former<br>
than in the latter. When the amounts of used fuel for one hour<br><br>
are compared, it is smaller by as much as 2.1 liters in the<br>
former than in the latter.<br>
[0060]<br>
Meanwhile, as can be understood from FIG. 6, according<br>
to the conventional thermal cracking method, an amount of<br>
production of the refined oil 03 per 10 minutes in a period<br>
from the start of production to 60 minutes later is in a range<br>
of 0.37 liter/10 minutes to 0.41 liter/10 minutes.  An amount<br>
of production for one hour is 2.3 liters. On the contrary,<br>
according to the inventive process of upgrading oil, an amount<br>
of production of the refined oil O3 per ten minutes in a period<br>
from the start of production to 60 minutes later is in a range<br>
of 0.82 liter/10 minutes to 0.86 liter/10 minutes.  An amount<br>
of production for one hour is 5.1 liters. Accordingly, it is<br>
possible to obtain a larger amount of the refined oil O3 from<br>
a smaller amount of used fuel by the inventive process of<br>
upgrading oil than by the conventional thermal cracking method<br>
and energy efficiency is better in the former than in the latter.<br>
In order to obtain 1 liter of the refined oil 03, a fuel of<br>
about 2.74 liters is necessary for the conventional thermal<br>
cracking method. On the contrary, in order to obtain 1 liter<br>
of the refined oil 03, only a fuel of about 0.824 liter is<br>
necessary for the inventive process of upgrading oil.<br>
[0061]<br>
As has been described, for the equipment 1 for upgrading<br><br>
oil, there is no need to use a catalyst used in catalytic<br>
cracking and hydro-cracking, which eliminates the need for the<br>
regeneration processing of a catalyst.  In addition, it is<br>
possible to obtain the lighter refined oil 03 from the heavier<br>
material oil Ol under the relatively relaxed production<br>
conditions in comparison with those in the prior art. Moreover,<br>
energy efficiency to obtain the refined oil O3 is more<br>
satisfactory.<br>
[0062]<br>
Further, with the equipment 1 for upgrading oil. in a<br>
case where the material oil 01 contains sulfur, hydrogen atoms<br>
produced by the cracking of water molecules may react with<br>
sulfur in the material oil 01 to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S),<br>
which enables desulfurization.<br>
