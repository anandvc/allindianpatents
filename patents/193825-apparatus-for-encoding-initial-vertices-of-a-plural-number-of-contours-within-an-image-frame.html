				<td>The present invention. relates to an apparatus for contour coding; and more particularly, to an apparatus for encoding initial vertices of a plural number of contours within an image frame.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In digitally televised systems such as video-telephone, teleconference and high definition television systems, a large amount of digital data is needed to define each video frame signal since a video line signal in the video frame signal comprises a sequence of digital data reference to as pixel values. Since, however, the available frequency bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the large amount of digital data therethrough, it is necessary to compress or reduce the volume of data through the use of various data compression techniques, especially, in the case of such low bit-rate video signal encoders as video- telephone and teleconference systems.<br>
One of such techniques for encoding video signals for a low bit-rate encoding system is an object-oriented analysis-synthesis coding technique, wherein an input video image is<br>
-1A-<br><br>
divided into objects and three sets of parameters for defining the motion, the contour and the pixel data of each object are processed through different encoding channels.<br>
In processing a contour of an object, contour information is important for the analysis and the synthesis of the object shape. A classical coding method for representing the contour information is a chain coding method, wherein all the pixel on the contour ("contour pixel") are treated as vertices and coded to represent the contour information. The chain coding method, however, requires a substantial amount of bits for the representation thereof, although the method does not incur any loss in the contour information.<br>
To overcome the drawback, therefore, there have been proposed several methods to encode the contour information such as polygonal approximation and B-spline approximation, wherein selected contour pixels are determined as vertices and the contour is represented based on the vertices. One of the disadvantages in the polygonal approximation is the roughness in the representation of the contour. The B-spline approximation is, on the other hand, capable of representing the contour more precisely: however, it requires a high-order polynomial to reduce the approximation error and results in an increased overall computational complexity of the video encoder.<br>
In encoding the vertex information of a contour, on of the vertices of the contour is determined first as an initial<br>
-2-<br><br>
vertex and a relative displacement between each pair of adjacent vertices is<br>
computed.   The   vertex   information   is   then   coded  based  on   the   absolute<br>
position of the initial vertex and the relative displacements for the remaining<br>
vertices  through  the use of, e.g., the  so-called locally-adaptive octant based<br>
vertex   coding   technique   (see.,   "Revised   description   of  S4a:   Geometrical<br>
Representation    Method",    International    Organization    for   Standardization<br>
ISO/IEC   JTC1/SC29/WG11,   Coding   of   Moving   Pictures    and    Audio <br>
Information, Shape Coding AHG, 30, July, 1996).	<br>
According to the conventional contour encoding schemes, therefore the coding efficiency would be degraded in case there exist a multiple number of contours in a frame since an initial vertex of each contour is represented by using its absolute position within the frame.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, a primary object of the invention to provide an apparatus for further increasing the coding efficiency by encoding the initial vertices using displacements therebetween when there is one more than one contour in a frame.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for encoding initial vertices of a plural number of contours within frame of an<br>

which   informs   if   the   number   of   the   initial   vertices   is   smaller   than   the<br><br>

accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>

shown in Fig. 1; and	<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a block diagram of a contour coding apparatus 10 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, which includes a contour extraction block 110, a vertex selection block 120, a contour count block 130, a vertex coding block 140, an initial vertex coding block 150, and a multiplexor (MUX) 180.<br>
A segmentation mask of an input image signal is fed to the contour extraction block 110, wherein the input image includes one or more objects<br>
-5-<br><br>
and a background. Each pixel in the segmentation mask has a label identifying the region it belongs to. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, all the pixels constituting the objects ("object pixels") have one of binary numbers, e.g., 1 and the pixels corresponding to the background ("background pixels") are represented by the other binary number, e.g., 0. In another instance, the segmentation mask can be constituted such that all the background pixels are represented by zero values and the object pixels in an object have one of non-zero values, e.g., 1, 2, . .,255, identifying the object. In any case, each object can be easily identified by the label of the pixels in an object. At the contour extraction block 110, the contour of each object is detected, wherein the contour is made of contour pixels, the contour pixels representing object pixels residing at a boundary of an object The contours extracted by the contour extraction block 110 are provided to the vertex selection block 120 and the contour count block 130.<br>
The contour count block 130 detects the total number of contours included in the input image by counting the extracted contours inputted thereto from the contour extraction block 110 and provides the number of contours to die initial vertex coding block 150 via a line L3.<br>
The vertex selection block 120 determines vertices on each of the contours through the use, e.g., of a conventional polygonal approximation<br>
-6-<br><br>
technique for fitting the contour with a plurality of line segments, wherein a contour segment confined by two vertices disposed adjacent to each other along the contour is represented by a line segment formed by connecting the two vertices. The degree of the polygonal approximation is determined by a characteristic constant Dmax. In the polygonal approximation technique, a distance    between    each    contour   pixel    on    a   contour   segment   and   its<br><br>
corresponding line  segment is required not to be greater than the constant,<br>
Dmax. if the Dmax is smaller than one pixel distance, all the contour pixels are<br><br>
selected as vertices.	<br>
In addition to selecting the vertices of the contours, the vertex selection block 120 decides an initial vertex for each contour by using a conventional method. For example, a length of each line segment of a contour is calculated and one of the two vertices corresponding to the longest line segment can be set as an initial vertex of that contour. In another Instance, direction components, e.g., horizontal and vertical components, of the length of each line segment is computed and one of the two vertices corresponding to the largest direction component may be determined as the initial vertex for a contour.<br>
Outputted from the vertex selection block 120 are position information, i.e., the absolute addresses of the selected vertices for each contour, which arc<br><br>
f<br><br>
-7-<br><br>
fed to the vertex coding block 140 via a line L1 and those of the initial vertices to the initial vertex coding block 150 via a line L2.<br>
The vertex coding block 140 encodes relative positions of the non-initial vertices i.e., the vertices except the initial vertex for each contour based on a conventional vertex coding scheme, e.g., the locally-adaptive octant-based vertex coding technique, to thereby provide encoded non-initial vertex data to the MUX 180, the relative position of a vertex representing a displacement from a previously coded vertex to the vertex. In case the vertex is the first non-initial vertex of the contour to be coded, a displacement between the initial vertex of the contour and the vertex is coded instead. At the initial vertex coding block 150, the initial vertices are encoded and provided as encoded initial vertex data to the MUX 180.<br>
The     MUX   180   combines   the  encoded  initial  vertex   data  and  the encoded non-initial vertex data into coded contour data and provides the same to a transmitter (not shown) for the transmission thereof<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there are illustrated details of the initial vertex coding block 150, which includes a switch 152, a first comparison block 154, an absolute address coding block 156, a grouping block 158, a dynamic range calculation block 160, a displacement calculation block 162, a second comparison block 164, a selector 166, an escape coding block 168 and a displacement coding block 170.<br>
-8-<br><br>
The number of contours on the line L3 from the contour count block 130 shown in Fig. 1 is fed both to the first comparison block 154 and the dynamic range calculation block   160.<br>
The     first comparison block 154 compares the number of contours with a predetermined number. If the number   of contours   is smaller than, the predetermined number, the first  comparison  block     154    provides     a    first switching signal to the switch 152 which enables the switch 152 to convey position  information  for  the  initial  vertices  to  the  absolute  address-coding block 156.     However, if the number of contours is equal to or is larger than the predetermined number, the first comparison block  154 feeds a second switching signal to the switch 152 to transfer position information of the initial vertices to the grouping block 158.<br>
To the switch 152, the position information of the initial vertices selected by the vertex selection block 120 shown in Fig. 1 is inputted via the line L2. The switch 152, based on a switching signal provided thereto from the first comparison block 154, conveys the position information for the initial vertices on L2 either to the absolute address coding block 156 or to the grouping block 158.<br>
In response to the position information of the initial vertices, the absolute address-coding block 156 encodes the absolute addresses of the initial<br>
-9-<br><br>
vertices and sends the encoded absolute addresses as initial vertex data to the MUX 180 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Meanwhile, the dynamic range calculation block 160 calculates a horizontal dynamic range and a vertical dynamic range based on the number of<br>
contours coupled thereto via the line L3 and provides  them to the grouping<br><br>
block 158, the  second comparison block 164, and the displacement coding<br><br>
block 170. The horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges, which determine the<br><br>
number of bits required in encoding the initial vertices, is calculated as in the<br>
following example.	<br>
For the purpose of simplicity, the horizontal and vertical sizes, FSH and FSV of the frame, are assumed to be 352 and 240 pixels, respectively. To obtain the horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges, each of the FS H and the FSV is divided by     the number   of contours L first. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, if FSH/L and FSV/L are equal to or greater than 2M and 2 N but smaller than 2M+1 and 2 N+1, respectively, the      horizontal      and      the     vertical dynamic ranges, DRH and DRv, are determined as 2M+1-1 and 2N+1-1, M and N being non-negative integers. If,    for instance, there are 20 contours in a frame, FS H /L(=17.6) is    greater than 24 but smaller than 25 and therefore, M    is determined as 4, which gives        rise to horizontal dynamic range DRH of 25-l (=31).<br>
-10-<br><br>
Likewise, FSV/L equals to 12 and, therefore, the vertical dynamic range DRV for the frame including 20   contours   is   determined   to   be   24-l   (=15).<br>
In such an instance, a horizontal and a vertical dynamic range bits indicating bits needed in representing respective dynamic ranges are determined as M+l=5 and N+l=4 and fed to the displacement coding block 170.<br>
At the grouping block 158, the initial vertices of the contours within the image are divided into one or more groups depending on the displacements therebetween. With reference to Fig. 3, there is illustrated a grouping process carried out at the grouping block 158, wherein exemplary initial vertices, II to 113, are grouped into three groups A, B, and C. First of all, base on the position information of the initial vertices from the switch 152 and the horizontal and the vertical dynamic ranges from the dynamic range calculation block 160, the grouping block 158 determines a dynamic region for each initial vertex by forming a rectangle whose central point coincides with the initial vertex itself and whose horizontal and vertical lengths equal to the horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges, respectively. For the initial vertices 11 to 113 of Fig. 3, respective dynamic regions Rl to R13 are determined next. After deciding the dynamic regions of each initial vertex, the initial vertices whose dynamic regions overlap or arc contiguous to one another are set as a group,<br>
-11-<br><br>
wherein the two of the dynamic regions in a group form one overlapped region and none of the dynamic regions in a group overlap with any dynamic region of an initial vertex belonging to another group. In Fig. 3, the initial vertices II to 113 are grouped into three different groups A to C consisting of one or more initial vertices II, 12 to 15, and 16 to 113, respectively. Each initial vertex in a group having more than one initial vertex therein is coupled to at least one initial vertex via dynamic regions. For instance, 12 and 15 in the group B and 16, 111 and 113 in the group C have only one neighboring initial vertex, respectively; 18 in the group C has three neighboring initial vertices 17, 19 and 112, and each of the remaining vertices in the groups B and C has two neighboring initial<br>
vertices. Further, the horizontal and the vertical components of the displacement between a pair of initial vertices which have overlapping or contiguous dynamic regions are not greater than the horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges, respectively.<br>
Position information data of the initial vertices are then outputted one at a time to the displacement calculation block 162 and the selector 166 on a group-by-group basis. Since the order of groups is not fixed, if, e.g., group A iS outputted first, then any one of the groups B or C can be selected to be outputted next It should be noted, however, that the initial vertices in a group are outputted starting from one of the initial vertices, e.g., 12 or 15 in the group<br>
-12-<br><br>
B, which has only one neighboring vertex, and sequentially in an order of coupling each other. For instance, the vertices 12, 13, 14 and 15 in the group B are provided in that particular order or in a reversed order, i.e., 15 to 12. If a group includes a branch vertex, e.g., 18 in the group C, having more than two neighboring initial vertices, vertices of one branch, e.g., 16 to 111, are outputted first in that order, and-then vertices of another branch, such as 113, and 112 are outputted in that order.<br>
The displacement calculation block 162 calculates the horizontal and the vertical displacements between two initial vertices inputted thereto consecutively. When ADDH ( i) and ADDv(i) are the horizontal and vertical addresses of the i-th initial vertex inputted thereto from the grouping block 158, and an i-th horizontal and vertical displacement DH,(i) and Dv(i) may be defined as:<br>
DH (i) =ADDH,(i) -ADDH(i-1)<br>
DP (I) =ADDv (i) -ADDV (i - 1)<br>
Wherein i is a positive integer from 1 to L, L being a total number of the initial vertices, and ADD H (0) and ADDv (0) are preset initial values having such large values that generate DH ( 1) and Dv(l) whose absolute values are greater than any possible horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges.<br>
-13-<br><br>
The calculated horizontal and vertical displacements are fed both to the second comparison block 164 and the selector 166. At the second comparison block 164, for each initial vertex, the absolute values of the DH(i) and the Dv(i) are compared with the horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges, DRH and DRV, respectively. If the absolute values of the horizontal and vertical displacements<br>
for an initial vertex arc       both  equal to  or  smaller  than  the  corresponding<br>
dynamic ranges, respectively, the second comparison block 164 sets the initial<br><br>
vertex as a relative vertex and generates a first selection signal to the<br>
selector 166. If. however, a magnitude of any of the two displacements DH (i)<br>
and the Dv(i) is larger than the corresponding dynamic ranges, the second<br>
comparison block 164 sets the initial vertex as an absolute vertex and provides<br>
the selector 166 with a second selection signal.	<br>
The selector 166 provides the displacements DH (i) and the Dv(i) to the displacement coding block 170 if the first selection signal is inputted thereto; and transfers the absolute addresses, i.e., ADDH (i) and ADDv(i), to the escape coding block 168 in response to the second selection signal. In other words, the selector 166 selectively provides the relative and absolute vertices to the displacement coding block 170 and the escape coding block 168 in response to the first and the second selection signals, respectively. For the exemplary initial vertices shown in Fig. 3, if the vertices are provided by the grouping block 158<br>
-14-<br><br>
in an order of II to III, I13 and I12, transferred to the escape coding block 168 are first vertices, II, I2,I6, of the groups A, B and C and a first vertex I13 of a branch in the group C, Those vertices I1, I2, I6 and I13 are absolute vertices because the II is the first vertex outputted from the grouping block 158 and the subsequent vertices, I2, I6 and I3, are all disposed outside the dynamic regions thereof, respectively.<br>
The escape coding block 168 encodes the position information of each absolute vertex inputted thereto by using a predetermined escape code, wherein the escape code indicates that a codeword appearing thereafter is an encoded absolute address. For example, upon receiving horizontal and vertical addresses of an absolute vertex, e.g., 12, the escape coding block 168 produces the escape code followed by the encoded horizontal and vertical absolute addresses of the vertex 12. Escape-coded data from the escape coding block 168 is fed to the MUX 180 shown in Fig. 1, the escape-coded data including the escape code and the encoded horizontal and vertical address of each absolute vertex.<br>
The displacement coding block 170 encodes the horizontal and the vertical displacements of the relative vertices conveyed thereto from the selector 166 by using the number of bits assigned by the dynamic range calculation block 160 to thereby send encoded relative vertex data for each<br>
45-<br><br>
relative vertex to the MUX 180. For instance, if the horizontal and the vertical dynamic range bits determined by the dynamic range calculation block 160 are 5 and 4, respectively, the displacement coding block 170 generates first horizontal and vertical range bit data representing respective dynamic range bits and then encodes the displacement for each relative vertex by using the horizontal and the vertical dynamic range bits. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of the horizontal and the vertical range bit data is represented in 3 bits. The range bit data and the encoded displacement data for the relative vertices are transferred to the MUX 180.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the grouping block 158 may be changed to append to each initial vertex a group index indicating the group the initial vertex belongs to. And then the grouping block 158 sends the absolute addresses of each initial vertex to the displacement calculation block 162. The displacement calculation block 162 may be modified to directly provide the displacements to the displacement coding block 170. In this embodiment, the second comparison block 164 and the selector 166 are not needed. The displacement calculation block 162 sends the absolute addresses of a first initial vertex in each group to the escape coding block 168 and transmits displacements for the subsequent initial vertices in each group to the displacement coding block 170. In such an instance, if a group includes a<br>
-16-<br><br>
branch as in the case of group C in Fig. 3, the grouping block 158 also issues reference vertex information for a first initial vertex in a second branch. For example, if the vertices in the group C are outputted from the grouping block 158 in the order of 16 to I11, the vertices I12 and I13 are outputted to the displacement calculation block 162 in that order with the reference vertex information attached to the I12 indicating that the reference vertex of the first<br><br>
initial vertex 112 of the second branch is 18. Based on the reference vertex<br><br>
information, the displacement calculation block 162 provides the displacement, data of the vertex I12 obtained with respect to the branch vertex 18.     <br>
In short, if the number of contours in an image frame is less than the predetermined number, all the absolute addresses of the initial vertices of the contours are encoded at the absolute address coding block 156 and are transmitted as the encoded initial vertex data to the MUX 180. However, if the number of the contours are greater than or equal to the predetermined number, the contours are divided into a plurality of groups, wherein if a position of an initial vertex in a group is known, relative displacements of all the other vertices in the group with respect to the initial vertex can be represented by dynamic ranges determined by the number of the contours. Thereafter, absolute position information of a first initial vertex in each group is encoded at the escape coding block 168 and all the remaining<br>
-17-<br><br>
initial vertices are encoded at the displacement coding block 170 based on their displacements and the dynamic ranges. The escape-coded data and the displacement coded data are provided as the encoded initial vertex data to the MUX 180. At the MUX 180, the encoded non-initial vertex data from the vertex coding block 140 and the encoded initial vertex data from the initial vertex coding block 150 are multiplexed into the coded contour data and are transmitted to the transmitter (not shown) for the transmission thereof.<br>
While the present invention has been described with respect to certain preferred embodiments      only,   other   modifications   and   variations   can   be<br>
made without departing forth in the following claims.<br>
-18-<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.        An apparatus for encoding initial vertices of a plural number of contours within frame of an input image signal, wherein the initial vertex is one of a set of<br>
vertices representing a contour, comprising:<br>
first comparison block (154) for comparing number of initial vertices with<br>
a predetermined number;<br>
switch (152) for switching the initial vertices based on the comparison result which informs if the number of the initial vertices is smaller than the predetermined number or not;<br>
absolute address coding block (156) for encoding absolute addresses of the initial vertices if the number of initial vertices is smaller than the predetermined number;<br>
dynamic range calculation block (160) for calculating a horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges of the frame;<br>
grouping block (158) for obtaining a dynamic region of each initial vertex to thereby group the initial vertices having overlapping or contiguous dynamic regions together and for providing the initial vertices one at a time in a group and on a group-by-group basis;<br>
second comparison block (164) and selector (166) for determining if the initial vertex is in a different group from the immediately preceding one or not;<br>
-19-<br><br>
escape coding block (168) for escape coding the initial vertex if the initial vertex is in the different group from the immediately preceding one;<br>
displacement calculation block (162) and displacement coding block (170) for coding the displacement of the initial vertex from the immediately preceding initial vertex if the initial vertex is in a same group as the immediately preceding one; and<br>
multiplexor (180) for rendering the escape coded initial vertices and the displacement coded initial vertices as encoded initial vertex data.<br>
2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dynamic range calculation<br>
block (160) for calculating the horizontal and vertical dynamic ranges of the<br>
frame, DRH and DRV, divides horizontal and vertical sizes of the frame FSH and<br>
FSv by the number of contours L, L being a non-negative integer; and if FSH/L<br>
and FSV/L are equal to or greater than 2M and 2N but smaller than 2M+1 and 2N+1.<br>
respectively, sets the horizontal and the vertical dynamic ranges, DRH and DRV, as<br>
2M+1 -1 and 2 N+1-1, M and N being non-negative integers.<br>
3. The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the escape coding block (168)<br>
for escaping coding the initial vertex produces a horizontal and vertical escape<br>
codes; and encodes the horizontal and vertical absolute addresses of the initial vertex.<br>

4.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the displacement calculation<br>
block (162) and the displacement coding block (170) for coding displacement<br>
comprises:<br>
displacement calculation block (162) for calculating horizontal and vertical displacements of the initial vertex provided i-th from the providing means, i being an integer from 1 to L; and<br>
displacement coding block (170) for allocating M+1 and N+1 bits for encoding the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively; and encoding horizontal and vertical displacements of the initial vertex.<br>
5.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the multiplexor (180) for<br>
rendering  the   encoded  initial  vertex  data  multiplexes  the  encoded absolute<br>
addresses of the first initial vertex of the group with the encoded displacements<br>
of rest of the initial vertices within the group to thereby provide encoded initial<br>
vertex data for each group of initial vertices; and outputs the encoded initial<br>
vertex data of each group of initial vertices on a group-by-group basis.<br>
Dated        this        10th	day       of     June,       1997.<br><br><br>
-21-<br><br>
Apparatus for encoding initial vertices of a plural number of contours within   an   image   frame  which   comprises   of  (referring  to   Fig.   2):   a  first comparison    block    (154)    compares    number    of   initial   vertices  with    a predetermined number; and a switch (152) switches the initial vertices based on <br><br>
the comparison result wherein, an absolute address coding block (156) encodes absolute addresses of the initial vertices, wherein, a grouping block (158) obtains a dynamic region of each initial vertex; a second comparison block (164) and selector (166) determine if the initial vertex is in a different group from the immediately preceding one or not; and an escape coding block (168) escape-codes the initial vertex if the initial vertex is in the different group from the immediately preceding one; a displacement calculation block (162) and displacement coding block (170) encodes the displacement of the initial vertex from the immediately preceding initial vertex; and a multiplexor (180) renders the escape initial vertices and the displacements coded initial vertices as encoded initial vertex data.<br></td>
