Field of the invention:This invention relates to a process of making a novel refreshing drink.<br>
Baclcground of Invention:<br>
Beverage products such as coffee enjoy considerable popularity and make up an increasingly significant proportion of the diets of many people. However, these high quality coffee products are both expensive to purchase and to produce. One such reason is the cost of the raw materials. Due to the nature of coffee production (e. g., growing cycle, season, location, and the like) it is difficult to offset an increase in demand for consumer preferred coffees. This results in higher production costs for high quality coffee food and beverage products that must eventually be borne by the consumer.<br>
Caffeine is one of the most popular drug in the world. It is consumed in coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some drugs. The actual source of caffeine is the coffee bean, tea leaf, kola nut and cacao pod. Pure caffeine is odorless and has a bitter taste. It is a central nervous system stimulant. In increased doses, caffeine can, reduce fine motor coordination, cause insomnia, headaches, nervousness and dizziness.<br>
Objectives<br>
The main objective of this invention is to make a refreshing drink that does not cause any harmful side effects.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to make a drink that is consumable by all age groups.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a novel refreshing drink.<br>
Another objective of invention is to provide a novel refreshing drink at reduced cost.<br><br>
Summary:<br>
Dates i.e. Phoenix dactylifera due to its tannin content, is used medicinally as a astringent in intestinal troubles. In the form of an infusion, decoction, syrup or paste, is administered as a treatment for sore throat, colds, bronchial catarrh. It is taken to relieve fever, cystisis, gonorrhea, edema, liver and abdominal troubles. And it is said to counteract alcohol intoxication. In most of the industries date seeds are generally treated as waste.<br>
The present invention involves making of a novel refreshing drink from the discarded date seeds. The date seeds removed from the dates are processed using predetermined steps and at set temperature to obtain a novel refreshing drink which is consumeable as a drink like coffee, tea etc. The drink is easily produced withouth any complex process or device, at a reduced cost. The present invention does not produce any harmful side effects. It also serves as an alternate for caffeine based drinks without inducing any side effects.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become fully apparent with reference to specfication in the following detailed description.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention the objectives are obtained in the following manner. A novel refreshing drink comprises the following steps of soaking the peeled seed of Phoenix dactylifera i.e dates in wet sand for period of 3-6 days. The soaked seeds are cleaned and rinsed with clean water; the cleaned seeds are exposed to or subjected to hot air blow for a time period of less than 1 hr. The hot air dried seeds are then roasted i.e. the dried raw date seeds are brought into contact with heated roasting gas and roasted at normal temperature of. The roasting of raw date seeds in performed for a predetermined time period of 30 mins - 45 mins at a normal temperature of 110°C to 120°C. As the seed is<br><br>
turned over and over, the moisture content drops and the colour of the seeds appear to be rich brownish - black in colour. The roasted seeds are feed to a pulverizer. The pulverzier provided with a rotary cutter rotated by a driving force of a motor and is equipped with grinding blade on the upper side. The pulverizer fine grinds the roasted seeds and the powdered seeds are sieved to obtain fine powder. The seeds are dried by blowing hot air for about more than 30 mins. The pulverized seeds are mixed with Elettaria cardamomum or Coriandnum sativam or dried Zingiber officinale or all at set propotion.<br>
Elettaria cardamomum: Elettaria cardamomum has its origin in the Ghat Mountains on the Malabar coast of South West India. According to the present invention the seeds obtained from Elettaria cardamomum are cleaned and dried in hot sun for about 2- 3 days. The dried seeds are fed to a rotary pulverizer and grinded to obtain fine powder. According to the present invention the about 0.5% by weight to about 10% by weight of fine powdered seeds of Elettaria cardamomum is added to the pulverized powder.<br>
Coriandrum sativum: Coriandrum sativum has its origin in the Ghat Mountains on the Malabar coast of South West India. According to the present invention the seeds obtained from Coriandrum sativum are cleaned and dried in hot sun for about 1- 2 days. The dried seeds are fed to a rotary pulverizer and grinded to obtain fine powder. According to the present invention the about 0.5% by weight to about 10% by weight of fine powdered seeds of Coriandrum sativum is added to the pulverized powder.<br>
Zingiber officinale: Zingiber officinale has its origion in the tropical regions of Asia. Fifty percent of world wide production is in India According to the present invention the rhizomes of Coriandrum sativum are well cleaned and sliced into small pieces. The sliced pieces are dried seeds in hot sun for about 2-4 days to remove the   moisture content and are fed to a rotary pulverizer and grinded to<br><br>
obtain fine powder. According to the present invention the about 0.5% by weight to about 10% by weight of fine powdered seeds of Zingiber officinale is added to the pulverized powder.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modifications and this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention following, in general, the principles of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure come within known or customary practice within the art to which the invention pertains and may be applied to the essential<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
