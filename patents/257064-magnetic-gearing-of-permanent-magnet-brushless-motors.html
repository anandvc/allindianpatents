This invention relates to the magnetic gearing of permanent magnet brushless<br>
motors.<br>
Permanent magnet brushless motors are known which are capable of providing<br>
variable speed outputs. The motor characteristics are linear, generating high torque at low<br>
speeds and high speed at low torque levels.<br>
In certain applications, the range of speed and torque characteristics of a particular<br>
motor may not be sufficient to cover the desired range, even though the output power of the<br>
motor may be sufficient. In such circumstances two options are available. Firstly, a more<br>
powerful motor could be used to cover the entire range or secondly, mechanical gears could<br>
be provided for the motor. Both of these methods add cost and weight to the system.<br>
Canadian Patent Application No. 2341095 discloses an alternative to the above-<br>
mentioned methods which uses a technique in which the speed and torque can be varied<br>
inside the motor and the only additional item required is a switching circuit. A prerequisite of<br>
this technique is that the stator coils of the motor must be segmented into at least two or more<br>
sections, which are evenly or perhaps unevenly distributed throughout the stator slots. The<br>
switching circuit can then be used to change the number of coil segments which are connected<br>
to the supply. Such an arrangement utilises the control of the induced back electromotive<br>
force (back emf) to control the speed by selectively altering the number of conductors which<br>
are connected to the supply. This in effect also alters the torque with changing speed of the<br>
motor.<br>
In the main embodiment of Canadian Patent Application No. 2341095, each of the<br>
motor windings comprises a plurality of series-connected sections provided by tappings in the<br>
winding, which can be selectively connected across the supply. With just one of the coil<br>
segments connected across the supply, the motor will produce a high speed but a low torque.<br>
However, with a higher proportion of coils connected in series across the supply, the motor<br>
will produce a lower speed at the same torque. In this manner, the speed but not the torque of<br>
the motor can be varied by selectively connecting the windings in series.<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment, each of the motor windings comprises a plurality of<br>
parallel-connected sections, which sections can be selectively connected in parallel across the<br>
supply. With just one of the coil segments connected across the supply, the motor will<br>
produce a high speed but a low torque as previously described. However, with a higher<br>
proportion of coils connected in parallel across the supply, the motor will produce high torque<br>
at the same speed. In this manner, the torque but not the speed of the motor can be varied by<br>
selectively connecting the windings in parallel.<br>
A disadvantage of either arrangement is that sections are redundant when running<br>
the motor during some configurations and thus copper(I2R) losses will be higher because the<br>
cross-sectional area of copper utilised decreases as the number of active sections decreases.<br>
Also, the presence of redundant sections means that the net resistance of the coils is not<br>
optimised in all configurations and hence the supply current or voltage has to be controlled to<br>
avoid damaging the connected coils. Since speed and torque are functions of the current, any<br>
limitation of the current affects the performance of the motor.<br>
In most situations, the supply current to the motor is limited (for example in<br>
domestic mains to 13 amps), and thus the attainable speed and torque will not be optimised<br>
when some coils are out of circuit.<br>
We have now devised a permanent magnet brushless motor which alleviates the<br>
above-mentioned problem.<br>
In accordance with this invention, there is provided a permanent magnet brushless<br>
motor comprising a winding divided into a plurality of sections and switch means for<br>
selectively connecting the sections of the winding in one of a plurality of different<br>
configurations, wherein each section is connected in series and/or parallel with all other<br>
sections of the winding.<br>
The switch means can then be used to change magnetic gears, by changing the<br>
configuration of the coil segments in series, parallel or a combination of both, which are<br><br>
connected to the supply. We call such an arrangement magnetic gearing because it utilises the<br>
control of the induced back electromagnetic force (back emf) to control the speed by<br>
selectively altering the winding configuration which are connected to the supply. This alters<br>
the torque with changing speed of the motor.<br>
In contrast to known methods of varying the speed or torque by coil manipulation,<br>
the present invention is distinguished in that all of the winding segments contribute towards<br>
the motor operation no matter which section configuration is being employed. In this manner,<br>
all of the available copper is utilised at all times, thereby keeping the copper loss of the motor<br>
to a minimum.<br>
The advantage of utilising all of the winding sections is the reduction of the motor's<br>
copper loss. Normally the stator slots are packed with as much copper wire as possible, either<br>
by maximising the number of turns, or by maximising the wire diameter (if the number of<br>
turns have been predetermined for the design). In this manner the cross-section area of copper<br>
is maximised for the slot, so that the resistance of the coils is kept to a minimum. Hence the<br>
copper loss for the motor will always be kept to a minimum.<br>
In a first configuration, the switch means is preferably arranged to connect all of the<br>
winding sections in parallel. In this configuration at a given current I, the motor is able to<br>
reach high speeds at relatively low torque levels.<br>
In a second configuration, the switch means is preferably arranged to connect all of<br>
the winding sections in series. In this configuration at the same current I, the motor is only<br>
able to deliver high levels of torque at relatively low speeds.<br>
In a third configuration, the switch means is preferably arranged to connect some of<br>
the winding sections in parallel, with at least one other section being connected in series with<br>
the parallel-connected sections. In this configuration at the same current, the motor is able to<br>
reach speeds between that of the first and second configurations and deliver a torque between<br>
the first and second configurations.<br><br>
In order to further vary the speed v torque characteristic of the motor, the voltage<br>
applied to the winding may be pulse-width modulated, for example using said switch means.<br>
The speed v torque characteristic of the motor may also be varied by rapidly<br>
switching the winding sections between different configurations to obtain a characteristic<br>
intermediate that of the configurations between which the windings are switched.<br>
Preferably the switch means is able to vary the configuration of the winding<br>
connections whilst the motor is running, in accordance with predetermined operating<br>
parameters.<br>
Preferably, the switch means is able to vary the configuration of the winding<br>
connections whilst the motor is running, in accordance with the output of means for sensing<br>
an operating parameter of the motor such as the current, voltage, speed or torque, or in<br>
accordance with the output of means for sensing an operating parameter of the article being<br>
driven by the motor such as velocity. In the case of a multi-phase motor having a plurality of<br>
windings, the switch means may vary the configuration of the winding connections of a<br>
conducting phase whilst the motor is running, in accordance with the back emf measured<br>
across the winding of non-conducting phase or a section thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the switch means is able to vary the configuration of the winding<br>
connections in accordance with time or an operating cycle or program.<br>
Alternatively, means may be provided for manually changing the configuration of<br>
the winding connections.<br>
Preferably all of the sections of the winding are wound in parallel during assembly,<br>
with the current preferably flowing through each section in the same direction.<br>
One of the sections of the winding may comprise a different number of turns from<br>
another section. Also, one of the sections of the winding may comprise a conductor having a<br>
different cross-sectional area than the conductor of another section.<br><br>
An embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of an example only<br>
and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of one phase of a 3- phase permanent magnet<br>
brushless motor in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figures 2 to 6 are schematic diagrams showing various connections of sections of<br>
the motor of Figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 7 is a table showing the switch states of the motor of Figure 1 with reference<br>
to the connections of Figures 2 to 6;<br>
Figure 8 is a graph of speed v torque for the connections of Figures 2 to 6; and<br>
Figure 9 is graph of speed v torque to illustrate how the ideal motor characteristics<br>
for a washing machine can be achieved using the motor of Figure 1.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is shown a 3-phase permanent magnet<br>
brushless DC motor comprising three star-connected phases R, Y, B 18 slots, 12 poles and a<br>
slot pitch of 1. The stator outer diameter, inner diameter and length are 110mm, 55 mm and<br>
75mm, respectively. The air gap is 0.5mm, the magnet width and thickness are 10mm and 4<br>
mm, respectively.<br>
Each phase comprises a winding having, for example, five conductors or so-called<br>
sections 1-5 of 0.63mm enamelled copper which are co-wound in parallel through the relevant<br>
stator slots of the motor. The supply voltage to the motor is 180 volts DC.<br>
The first end of the first section 1 of one phase R is connected to the first ends of the<br>
first sections of the other two phases Y, B. The first end of the first section of the phase R is<br>
also connected to the first end of the second section 2 of that phase R via a switchSl.<br><br>
Likewise, the first ends of the other sections 3,4, 5 are connected to adjacent sections via<br>
respective switches S2, S3, S4.<br>
Similarly, the second end of the first section 1 of the phase R is connected to the<br>
second end of the second section 2 of that phase R via a switch S9. Likewise, the second ends<br>
of the other sections 3,4, 5 are connected to adjacent sections via respective switchesS10, S11,<br>
S12. The second end of the fifth section 5 is also connected to the supply.<br>
The second end of the first section 1 of the phase R is connected to the first end of<br>
the second section 2 of that phase R via a switch S5. Likewise, the second ends of the other<br>
sections2, 3,4 are connected to the first ends of adjacent sections via respective<br>
switchesS6,S7,S8.<br>
Referring to Figures 2,7 and 8 of the drawings, when the motor is initially started,<br>
only the switches S5 to S8 are energised such that the sections 1-5 are connected in series.<br>
In this manner the supply current flows through each series- connected section 1-5 in<br>
the same direction with respect to each section's polar orientation (as indicated by the arrows<br>
in Figure 1): it is imperative that this is always the case.<br>
Had one of the sections (e. g. section 4) been oriented in the opposite direction, the<br>
flux produced by section 4 would oppose the flux produced by sections 1,2, 3 and 5.<br>
The torque of the motor is directly proportional to the current and, as long as the<br>
starting torque is high enough to overcome the load attached to the motor, the rotor begins to<br>
turn. This is accompanied by the generation of a back emf in the coils, which begins to cancel<br>
out the supply voltage, so that the current available for the phase coils begins to reduce, as<br>
does the torque produced by the motor.<br>
The back emf, is directly proportional to the number of turns in the phase coils, the<br>
magnetic flux produced by the permanent magnets, the number of permanent magnet pole<br><br>
pairs and the angular speed of the rotor. Other factors, such as the interconnection between<br>
the coils and the phases and the number of phases also affects the back emf generated.<br>
The consequence of this behaviour is that, the motor will continue to accelerate until<br>
the torque produced by it, equals the load. From this point on, the motor will continue to<br>
rotate at a constant speed. If at any instance the load is altered, the motor will automatically<br>
adjust its torque (and consequently, its speed) in order to balance the load.<br>
The maximum speed that can be attained by a motor, occurs when there is no load<br>
attached to the motor. Ideally, this occurs when the back emf generated in the phase coils is<br>
equal to the supply voltage, at which instance there is no current flowing through the coils to<br>
produce any torque ; this situation is referred to as the no load speed.<br>
In reality, the back emf will always remain marginally lower than the supply voltage<br>
(even at no load speed). This is because a small portion of power supply is used up in<br>
overcoming frictional forces due to windage and the bearings, as well as iron losses of the<br>
motor.<br>
It is evident from the graph of Figure 8 that the motor is limited to performance<br>
criteria within the speed v torque line for Figure 2. The graph indicates that the motor can<br>
manage a maximum speed of 584 rpm and a maximum torque of 28.1 Nm. As a further<br>
example, it can also provide torque of 8 Nm up to a maximum speed of approximately 400<br>
rpm, or conversely, the motor running at 400 rpm, can provide up to a maximum torque of<br>
approximately 8 Nm.<br>
If the desired motor performance falls beyond the 10 amp line, for instance 14 Nm at<br>
600 rpm, the motor parameters need to be altered in order to cater for the additional power<br>
requirements.<br>
Referring to Figures 3,7 and 8 of the drawings, the motor's performance can be<br>
changed by altering the configuration in which all of the motor's windings are connected. By<br>
energising the switches in accordance with Figure 7, sections 1 and 2 can be connected in<br><br>
parallel and this parallel set is then connected in series with section 3,4 and 5 (which are<br>
connected in series with one another).<br>
It is evident from the graph of Figure 8 that the motor is now limited to performance<br>
criteria within the speed v torque line for Figure 3. The graph indicates the motor will now<br>
generate a no load speed of 725 rpm and a stall torque of 34.6 Nm.<br>
Referring to Figures 4,7 and 8 of the drawings, the motor's performance can be<br>
changed again by energising the switches in accordance with Figure 7, so that sections 1,2<br>
and 3 are connected in parallel and this parallel set is then connected in series with sections 4<br>
and 5 (which are connected in series with one another).<br>
It is evident from the graph of Figure 8 that the motor is now limited to performance<br>
criteria within the speed v torque line for Figure 4. The graph indicates the motor will now<br>
generate a no load speed of 966 rpm and a stall torque of 46.1 Nm.<br>
Referring to Figures 5,7 and 8 of the drawings, the motor's performance can be<br>
changed again by energising the switches in accordance with Figure 7, so that sections 1,2, 3<br>
and 4 are connected in parallel and this parallel set is then connected in series with section 5.<br>
It is evident from the graph of Figure 8 that the motor is now limited to performance<br>
criteria within the speed v torque line for Figure 5. The graph indicates the motor will now<br>
generate a no load speed of 1449 rpm and a stall torque of 69. 0 Nm.<br>
Referring to Figures 6,7 and 8 of the drawings, the motor's performance can finally<br>
be changed by energising the switches in accordance with Figure 7, so that sections 1,2, 3,4<br>
and 5 are connected in parallel.<br>
It is evident from the graph of Figure 8 that the motor is now limited to performance<br>
within the speed v torque line for Figure 6. The graph indicates the motor will now generate a<br>
no load speed of 2898 rpm and a stall torque of 136.7 Nm.<br><br>
At first sight, one may consider that the best option would be to implement the<br>
configuration of Figure 6 (i.e. all sections in parallel), since this choice yields the greatest<br>
range in terms of both speed and torque. However, although the voltage supplied to all of the<br>
configurations is the same (180 volts DC), the current varies from one configuration to the<br>
next. In practical applications there will always be a current limit, for example most<br>
household appliances are limited to 13 amps. Referring to Figure 8, if a notional 10 amp limit<br>
is applied to each configuration, it will be seen that the maximum torque achievable by the<br>
configuration of Figures 2 to 6 are 29.7, 23.7, 17.8, 11.9 and 5.9 Nm respectively. Thus, by<br>
operating the switches to change between the various configurations, whilst keeping the<br>
motor within the confines of the 10 amp limit, a performance can be achieved as shown in the<br>
shaded area of the graph. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that a gearing system for the<br>
motor can be provided by operating the switches, thereby allowing the motor to generate<br>
higher torque (at low speed) and higher speed (with low torque) than would be possible with<br>
any single configuration (with limited current supply). Thus, when the motor is initially<br>
energised, all sections can be connected in series as shown in Figure 2, such that a high<br>
starting torque is achieved well within the confines of the 10 amp limit.<br>
The switches S1 to S12 can be relays or semiconductor devices. In the case of<br>
semiconductor devices, a plurality of devices could be included in a single package.<br>
Individual switches for example S1, S5 and S9 can be configured into a single mechanical or<br>
electronic switch. In this case when 1 and 9 are ON, then 5 is OFF. When 5 is ON, then 1 and<br>
9 are OFF.<br>
This way only 4 switches will be required per phase instead of 12 switches.<br>
Referring to Figure 9 of the drawings, there is shown a graph of the required speed v<br>
torque curve 20 for a domestic washing machine superimposed onto the graph of Figure 8. At<br>
present the required speed and torque are normally achieved by using induction motors<br>
running at high speeds with appropriate mechanical gearing and drive belts, or by using a<br>
large DC direct drive motor. However, it can be seen that the required range of speed and<br>
torque can easily be achieved within the current confines using a reasonably sized direct drive<br>
brushless DC motor in accordance with this invention.<br><br>
It will be seen that the configurations of Figures 3 and 4 are not necessary to provide<br>
the required speed v torque curve for a domestic washing machine and thus some cost savings<br>
can be achieved by omitting some of the switches.<br>
It should be noted that the multi-segmented coils within a single phase need not be<br>
wound using the same wire diameter or the same number of turns, however, all the phases<br>
must be wound in an identical manner. For instance, section 1 of every phase must be wound<br>
with the same wire and have the same number of turns. Coil section 2 can have a different<br>
number of turns and it can be wound using a different wire diameter to that of section 1, but<br>
coil segment 2 of every phase must be identical and the same applies to all other segments.<br>
It will be appreciated that whilst the embodiment hereinbefore described utilises 3-<br>
phases, the invention applies to a motor having any number of phases. Furthermore, the<br>
invention also applies to permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors, which have<br>
similar speed torque characteristics.<br>
The configurations discussed in Figures 2 to Figures 6 are not the only possible<br>
combinations. For example, another possible combination is coil sections 1 and 2 connected<br>
in parallel and coil sections 3 and 4 connected in parallel, the two parallel sets being<br>
connected in series with one another and with the remaining section 5. This configuration will<br>
produce the same motor characteristics as the arrangement shown in Figure 4.<br>
Yet another configuration can be obtained by connecting sections 1,2 and 3 in<br>
parallel and sections 4 and 5 in parallel and then connecting the parallel sets in series with one<br>
another. This will yield motor characteristics that are the same as the one produced by the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 5.<br>
The number of speed-torque characteristics that can be obtained is dependent on the<br>
number of winding sections provided (per phase), which is limited to some finite number.<br><br>
The motor operates at its most efficient level when it is running as close as possible<br>
to its no load speed. For this reason, it is undesirable to allow the motor to compensate for an<br>
increase in load, by automatically reducing its speed (on the speed-torque characteristics line).<br>
It would be far better to meet the demands of the increase in load through magnetic gearing,<br>
so that the new torque level is achieved whilst the motor continues to run close to its no load<br>
speed. However, in order to meet all possible torque levels (within the given range of the<br>
motor) the motor would require an infinite number of magnetic gears and therefore, an<br>
infinite number of winding sections and switches.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, it is possible to achieve any speed torque curve in<br>
between those obtained by altering the configuration of the windings by interchanging<br>
between the two configurations very rapidly, so that the motor is not operating at the<br>
characteristics of either configuration, but somewhere in between. The rapid switching<br>
between the two configurations can be achieved by feeding a pulse width modulated (PWM)<br>
signal to the switches (S1 to S12) and the duty cycle of the PWM is altered to achieve the<br>
desired intermediate speed and torque.<br>
For example, consider a first configuration with all winding sections connected in<br>
parallel; this gear provides the highest speed the motor can achieve and therefore, it is the<br>
highest gear. The next gear down from this, is achieved by connecting one of the winding<br>
sections in series with the remaining parallel sections; this provides the next highest speed.<br>
If the PWM has a duty cycle of l00%, the gear will change from the highest to the<br>
next lower gear and remain there. Conversely, if a duty cycle of 0% (i.e. no signal) is chosen,<br>
the motor will remain in the highest gear. Choosing a duty cycle between 0 and 100% will<br>
yield a gear and consequently, a motor speed and torque between the highest two gears; i.e. an<br>
intermediate gear.<br>
If desired, the gearing can be switched directly between the highest gear (all sections<br>
in parallel) and the lowest gear (all sections in series). The duty cycle of the PWM can then be<br>
used to select a speed/torque characteristics anywhere in between the two extremes of the<br>
motor performance.<br><br>
However, the resolution and consequently, the accuracy with which a desired speed<br>
can be achieved decreases as the full range of the gearing scale increases. This, to some extent<br>
can be compensated by increase in PWM frequency.<br><br>
