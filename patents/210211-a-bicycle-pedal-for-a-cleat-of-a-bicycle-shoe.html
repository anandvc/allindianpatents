GAP ADJUSTING MECHANISM FOR BICYCLE PEDAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to bicycle pedals. More specifically, the present invention relates to a bicycle pedal having a cage surrounding a clipless pedal body such that the rider's shoe can engage the pedal with or without the cleat of the bicycle shoe being attached to the clipless pedal body.<br>
2.	Background Information<br>
In recent years, bicycle pedals have been designed for specific purposes such as for pleasure, off road biking, road racing, etc. One particular type of bicycle pedal which is gaining more popularity, is the step-in or clipless pedal which releasbly engages a cleat secured to the sole of a cyclist's shoe. The clipless pedal has a pedal spindle that can be mounted on the crank of a bicycle, a pedal body that is rotatably supported on this pedal spindle, and at least one cleat engagement mechanism with a pair of front and rear cleat clamping members that are fixed on either side or both sides of the pedal body for engaging front and rear portions of a cleat. In this type of bicycle pedal, the rider steps onto the pedal and the cleat engagement mechanism automatically grips on to the cleat secured to the bottom of the cyclist's shoe.<br>
More specifically, when attaching the cyclist's shoe to the step-in pedal via the cleat, the cyclist moves the shoe obliquely downwardly and forwardly relative to the pedal body such that the front end of the cleat engages a front hook or clamping member of the pedal body.. Once the front end of the cleat is engaged with the front hook of the pedal body, the cyclist places the rear end of the cleat in contact with a guide portion of the rear hook or clamping member of the pedal body. In this position, the cyclist presses the shoe downwardly against the pedal to cause the rear<br><br>
hook or clamping member to initially pivot rearwardly against the force of a spring to move the rear hook or clamping member to a cleat releasing position. The rear end of the cleat then enters a position opposite a back face of the rear hook or clamping member. Then, the rear hook or clamping member returns under the force of a biasing member or spring so that the rear hook or clamping member engages the rear end of the cleat. This engagement fixes the cyclist's shoe to the pedal via the cleat.<br>
When releasing the shoe from the pedal, the cyclist will typically turn the shoe about an axis perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the tread of the pedal, using the front end of the cleat as a pivoting point. As a result of this pivoting action, the rear hook or clamping member is pivoted rearwardly against the force of the spring to a cleat releasing position to release the shoe.<br>
When step-in pedals are used for road type bikes, the pedal is typically only provided with a single clamping assembly such that the cyclisf s shoe can only be coupled to one of the two sides of the pedal. Off road or mountain type bikes, on the other hand, usually have a pair of clamping assemblies such that the cyclist's shoe can be clamped to either side of the pedal. In either case, it is desirable to design the pedal to be as compact and light weight as possible.<br>
One problem with most clipless pedals is that they are quite small such that only small portions of the pedal body engages the rider's shoe. Specifically, the pedal body has a tread surface located on both sides of the cleat engagement mechanism. This tread surface has only a small surface area because the pedal body is typically made as small as possible so that it will be lightweight. With this type of clipless pedal, the shoe and the pedal are in a state of constant engagement when the cleat clamping is engaged in the cleat clamping members, so the pedaling force can be transmitted efficiently to the pedals. As a result, clipless pedals are widely employed on racing bicycles used in road racing and mountain bike racing.<br><br>
With this type of clipless pedal, if the she and the pedal are loose to the right and left around the cleat clamping members, then the rider's foot will wobble to the right and left and.the rider's pedaling force will not be transmitted efficiently to the pedal. Therefore, any looseness to the right and left between the shoe and pedal should be suppressed to a minimum by having the rubber portion of the shoe sole come into contact on the right and left of the cleat with a tread surface provided to the pedal body.<br>
The conventional structure described above merely consists of bringing the rubber portion of the shoe sole into contact with a tread surface having a tiny surface area in order to suppress looseness to the right and left of the shoe. Therefore, the contact length is minimal, and it is difficult to suppress properly the looseness to the right and left. Moreover, since the portion of the shoe sole that is in contact with the tread surface is the same portion that comes into contact with the ground when the rider is walking, it tends to wear down, and when this portion of the sole wears down, the tread surface and the shoe sole no longer come into contact uniformly, making it difficult to suppress the looseness between the shoe and pedal.<br>
Downhill races, dual slalom races, cross-country races, and other such off-road<br><br>
races for mountain bikes and BMX (bicycle motors) have been widely staged in recent years. In this type of off-road race, unlike in road racing, the riders traverse an unpaved track. Furthermore, with this type of off-road racing the foot must be repeatedly taken off the pedal during cornering and replaced on the pedal after the comer has been exited. Unfortunately, since the racing is performed on unpaved roads, mud clings to the pedals and tends to clog the cleat clamping members. Once the cleat clamping members become clogged with mud, the cleat cannot be engaged in the cleat clamping members, and the shoe cannot be attached to the pedal.<br>
When a cleat cannot be engaged with the cleat clamping members because of mud clogging, or when the rider's feet are frequently removed from the pedals, the<br><br>
rider must often step on the pedal without the cleat being completely engaged in the cleat clamping members. However, since the pedal bodies of the above-identified conventional clipless pedals are typically as small as possible and only have small tread surface areas, the rider's foot would slip off the pedal when the cleat was not engaged with the cleat clamping members. As a result, the rider's pedaling force is not transmitted efficiently to the pedals, and the speed of the bicycle drops. Lower speed is a critical problem for a racer. Accordingly, when it is expected that the pedals will become clogged with mud or the shoes will be taken off and replaced on the pedals frequently in this type of off-road race, more and more riders are using ordinary double-sided pedals rather than clipless pedals. Such pedals have no cleat engagement mechanisms, but they provide a good grip to the shoes in muddy situations. However, in either case, the cyclist does not have an optimum apparatus for pedaling the bicycle.<br>
For a step-in or clipless pedal to be usable in such muddy situations, it must be possible for the rider to step on the pedal stably even when the cleat is not engaged with the cleat clamping members. One possible means for achieving this could be to provide a wider tread cage on the pedal around the outside of the cleat clamping members so that more tread surface can come into contact with the shoe sole such as disclosed in European Patent Application No. 753,453 and European Patent Application No. 753,454. However, a mountain bike shoe differs from a road shoe in that the cleat is recessed into the shoe sole to make walking more comfortable. Thus, if a wide tread cage is provided around the outside of the cleat engagement mechanism, then the tread cage will interfere with the shoe sole and get in the way when the cleat is being engaged with the cleat engagement members. This, in turn, limits the engagement direction of the shoe. Consequently, when the shoe is inserted from a direction other than the engagement direction, it will be difficult to quickly reengage the cleat with the cleat engagement mechanism even if there is no mud clogging or the like.<br><br>
In view of the above, it is apparent that there exists a need for a clipless bicycle pedal which limits wobbling. Moreover, there exists a need for a bicycle pedal which can accommodate different types of sole designs of bicycle shoes. This invention addresses these needs in the art, along with other needs which will become apparent to those skilled in the art once given this disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring initially to Figures 1 through 4, a bicycle pedal 10 is illustrated in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention. Bicycle pedal 10 is a clipless or step-in pedal that can be used with a bicycle shoe 12 with a cleat 14 coupled thereto. Bicycle pedal 10 is especially designed for use with off road bicycles as opposed to use with a road bicycle. Of course, bicycle pedal 10 can be used on a road bicycle or any type of bicycle if needed and/or desired. As seen in Figure 1, bicycle pedal 10 is fixedly coupled to bicycle crank 16 of a bicycle for<br><br>
rotation therewith! The bicycle pedal 10 illustrated in the drawings is a right side pedal. Of course, the same pedal is provided on the left side of the bicycle with the left side pedal being the mirror image of the right side pedal 10. Thus, the description will be made herein with reference to only one of the pedals.<br>
As seen in Figure 2, bicycle pedal 10 basically includes a pedal shaft or spindle 20, a pedal body 22 with first and second cleat engagement mechanisms 24, a-cage 28 surrounding pedal body 22, a biasing member 30, and an adjustment mechanism 32 to change the angular position of cage 28 relative to pedal body 22. As shown in Figure 1, pedal spindle 20 is fastened to crank 16 of a bicycle, with pedal body 22 and cage 28 both being rotatably coupled to pedal spindle 20 for supporting a rider's foot. Specifically, cleat 14 is fixedly attached to bicycle shoe 12 which in turn is releasably attached to pedal body 22 via one of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24 in a conventional manner. Of course, the sole of bicycle shoe 12 can directly engage cage 28 without being coupled to one of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24. Cage 28 is positioned around pedal body 22 and is rotatably supported relative to pedal body 22 about pedal spindle 20.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the pedal spindle 20 is a multi-step spindle having numerous stepped portions which is received in a stepped bore 31 formed in pedal body 22. Pedal spindle 20 has a first end 33 with threads formed thereon for threadedly coupling pedal 10 to crank 16 in a conventional manner. The other end 34 of pedal spindle 20 rotatably supports pedal body 22 and cage 28. In particular, end 34 of spindle 20 has threads formed thereon for threadedly receiving lock nut 35 which secures pusher 36, bearing assembly 37, ring 38, sleeve or tube 39 and gasket 40 on pedal spindle 20. Since these parts are relatively conventional parts and the specific constructions of these parts are not critical to the present invention, they will not be discussed in detail herein. Rather, these parts will only be discussed as necessary to understand the present invention.<br><br>
Bearing assembly 37 rotatably supports pedal body 22 on pedal spindle 20 so that pedal body 22 can freely rotate about the center longitudinal axis A of pedal spindle 20. Sleeve 39, on the other hand, is fixedly coupled to pedal body 22 so that pedal body 22 rotates with sleeve 39. More specifically, the icier end 41 of sleeve 39 is threadedly coupled within the stepped bore 31 of pedal body 22.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, pedal body 22 has a center portion 43 and a par of side portions 44 that are rotatably supported by pedal spindle 20 for rotation about center longitudinal axis A. Pedal body 22 is preferably made of a lightweight material such as an aluminum alloy. One of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24 is located on each side of pedal body 22. Side portions 44 extend forward and backward from center portion 43, and are located on opposite sides of the cleat engaging mechanisms 24. Between the pair of side portions 44, center portion 43 defines an engagement fixing surface 45 on each side of pedal body 22 that serves to fix the cleat engagement mechanisms 24 thereto via screws 46.<br>
Cage 28 is preferably made of a lightweight material such as an aluminum alloy. Cage 28 surrounds pedal body 22 and is rotatably mounted on pedal spindle 20 for rotation about center longitudinal axis A. Biasing member or spring 30 biases<br><br>
pedal body 22 and cage 28 in opposite directions. As best seen in Figures 6 through 9, a stop member or abutment 50 is positioned on cage 28 to engage one of the side portions 44 of pedal body 22 to limit rotational movement between pedal body 22 and cage 28. In this position, the horizontal center plane B of pedal body 22 forms approximately a 12.5° angle with the horizontal center plane C of cage 28 such that the rearward ends of cleat engagement mechanisms 24 lie below the surface of cage 28. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the location and construction of stop member 50 can be changed as needed and/or desired. For example, stop member 50 could be formed on pedal body 22 for engaging a portion of cage 22. The frame of cage 28 is in the form of a compressed octagon or compressed oval (in plan view) and<br><br>
includes has a tread surface 53 on each side for engaging the sole portion of bicycle shoe 12.<br>
Cage 28 has a pair of parallel side sections 54 and 55, a pair of end sections 56 and 57, Side sections 54 and 55 have holes 58 and 59, respectively, which have bushings 60 and 61 positioned therein. Bushing 60 is frictionally retained on sleeve 39 so that cage 20 can rotate relative sleeve 39 and pedal body 22. Bushing 61 surrounds a plug 62 such that cage 28 rotates relative to plug 62. Plug 62 is secured to pedal body 22 by screw 63. Spring 30 is located within hole 59 of cage 28 between pedal body 22 and plug 62.<br>
Cage 28 is coupled to pedal body 22 so that cage 28 rotates with pedal body 22 about the center longitudinal axis A of pedal spindle 20. Specifically, biasing member 30 couples cage 28 to pedal body 22 for rotation therewith. Biasing member 30 in the preferred embodiment is a torsion spring with a first end 64 coupled within a recess or hole formed in the end of pedal body 22 and a second end 65 coupled within a recess formed in cage 28. Spring 30 is preloaded such that pedal body 22 and cage 28 are biased in opposite directions. In particular, spring 30 biases pedal body 22 in a counter clockwise direction as seen in Figures 6 and 7, while cage 28 is biased in a clockwise direction by spring 30. Rotational movement is limited by stop member 50 engaging pedal body 22. Accordingly, limited rotational movement is provided between pedal body 22 and cage 28. The amount of rotational movement between pedal body 22 and cage 28 is controlled by adjustment mechanism 32.<br>
Referring to Figures 2, and 6 through 9, adjustment mechanism 32 includes a first abutment 66 formed on pedal body 22, a second abutment 67 formed on cage 28, and an adjustment member or screw 68 interposed between abutments 66 and 67. While screw 68 is illustrated as being threadedly coupled to abutment 67 formed on cage 28, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that screw 68 could be threadedly coupled to abutment 66. Preferably, when screw 68 is fully<br><br>
threaded into abutment 67, such that the head of the screw bottoms out on abutment 66, the relative angular position between center planes B and C of pedal body 22 and cage 28, respectively, is approximately 0°. Of course, screw 68 can be longer such that pedal body 22 is angled in the opposite direction relative to cage 28. When screw 68 is either removed or unthreaded so that the tip of screw 68 does not engage abutment 66, the relative angular position between center lines B and C of pedal body 22 and cage 28, respectively, is approximately 12.5°. In particular, stop member 50 of cage 28 engages one of the side portions 44 of pedal body 22 to prevent further rotational movement therebetween. In other words, the angular position of pedal body 22 relative to cage 28 can be infinitely adjusted between at least 0° to at least 12.5°.<br>
Cleat engagement mechanisms 24 selectively engage cleat 16 of bicycle shoe 12 to attach the sole of a bicycle shoe 12 to pedal 10. Each of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24 has a front cleat engagement member 80 that engages the front portion of cleat 16 and a rear cleat engagement member 81 that engages the rear portion of cleat 16. Cleat engagement mechanisms 24 are well know in the art, and thus will only be briefly discussed herein.<br>
The front cleat engagement member 80 is symmetrical to the left and right of the center line of pedal 10. Cleat engagement member 80 is rigidly attached to the engagement fixing surface 45, and has a cleat clamping member or portion that curves out in a U-shape above the front of engagement fixing surface 45.<br>
Rear cleat engagement member 81 is curved in a roughly inverted U-shape, with its two ends being swingably supported by a fixed shaft 90 (see Figures 7 and 8) that passes between the side portions 50 of pedal body 22. A pair of canceling springs 91 are wound around the outside of this fixed shaft 90 for biasing rear cleat engagement member 81 such that it always rotates forward (the direction of the arrow in Figures 7 and 8).<br><br>
Pedal body 22 is biased in the counter-clockwise direction by the torsion spring 30 with respect to the cage 28 as shown in Figures 4 through 6, but counterclockwise rotation is restricted by adjustment mechanism 32 as explained above. Normally, adjustment mechanism 32 is set so that each cleat clamping member of the front cleat engagement member 80 is positioned above its respective tread surface 53 of cage 28, and each rear cleat engagement member 81 is positioned below its respective tread surface 53 of cage 28. As a result, when the bicycle shoe 12 is placed on the pedal 10, the cleat 14 can be engaged with one of the front cleat engagement members 80 without the shoe sole interfering with the cage 28.<br>
Operation of the pedal 10 will now be described with reference to Figures 5 through 8. In a state in which the shoe 12 is not attached to the pedal 10, as shore in Figures 2 and 3, the front cleat engagement members 80 of pedal body 22 are biased by the torsion spring 30 so that they are positioned above the tread surfaces 53 of cage 28, while the rear cleat engagement members 81 are positioned below the cage 28. When bicycle shoe 12 is to be attached to the pedal 10, the tip of the shoe sole is moved forward toward front cleat engagement member 80 so that the tip of cleat 14 is inserted into one of the cleat clamping members. In this state, since each front cleat engagement member 80 is positioned above its respective tread surface 53 of the cage 28, the cage 28 does not get in the way of the tip of cleat 14 which can be easily inserted into the front cleat clamping member.<br>
Once the tip of the cleat 14 has been inserted into one of the cleat clamping members 83 of the front cleat engagement member 80, force is applied to the heel side of the shoe 12, and the shoe 12 is pushed down toward the pedal 10. As a result, cage 28 and pedal body 22 rotate relative to each other against the biasing force of the torsion spring 30, and the two end up nearly parallel, as shown in Figures 5 and 7. When the heel is pressed down further from this state, the rear end of the cleat 14 rotates the rear cleat engagement member 81 backward (the opposite direction from the arrow in Figures 7 and 8) against the biasing force of the springs 91, and the cleat<br><br>
14 slides between "the two cleat engagement members 80 and 81. Once the cleat 14 has slid between the two cleat engagement members 80 and 81, the rear cleat engagement member 81 is biased by the spring 91 back to its original position wherein a tongue of cleat engagement members 81 hits against a rotation stopper of cleat engagement member 80. As a result, the cleat 14 is engaged between the two cleat engagement members 80 and 81,<br>
When the cleat 14 is engaged in the two cleat engagement members 80 and 81, the cage 28 is biased by the spring 30 forward with respect to the pedal body 22, the shoe sole comes into contact with side sections 54 and 55 of cage 28 as well as one of the end sections 56 and 57 of cage 28. As a result, the shoe sole is stabilized. Specifically, the shoe 12 resists leaning to the left or right by side sections 54 and 55 of cage 28, and the pedaling force is transmitted efficiently to the pedal 10. Thus, cage 28 provides a relatively wide tread surface 53 around the pedal body 22 to support the riders' foot. Since cage 28 and pedal body 22 rotate relative to each other, the front cleat engagement members 80 can always be positioned above tread surface 53 of cage 28 to permit easy engagement of cleat 14 with one of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24.<br>
When the shoe 12 is placed on the pedal 10 in a state in which the cleat 14 is not engaged with one of the cleat engagement mechanisms 24, then pedal body 22 rotates and the cleat engagement mechanisms 24 retract to the position seen in Figure 6. As a result, the shoe sole hits the wide tread surface 53, and the leg is able to move the pedal 10 in a stable attitude without wobbling to the left and right, so the function of a clipless pedal and the function of a double-sided pedal can both be realized with a single pedal. Accordingly, the pedaling force can be transmitted efficiently to the pedal 10 even in a state in which the cleat is not engaged during frequent cornering or in a state in which cleat engagement is impossible because of mud clogging during a race. Also, when the shoe is to be removed from the pedal 10, if the heel portion of the shoe 12 is lightly twisted to the outside, the rear cleat engagement member 81 will<br><br>
rotate to the rear against the energizing force of the spring 91, and the engagement of the rear end of the cleat 14 will be released instantly.<br>
EMBODIMENT OF FIGURES 10-12<br>
A right bicycle pedal in accordance with a second embodiment of the present   invention is illustrated in Figures 10-12. Bicycle pedal 110 is substantially identical to bicycle pedal 10 of the first embodiment, except that minor changes have been made to the shape of the pedal body 122, the cleat engagement mechanisms 124 and the cage 128. In view of the similarities between bicycle pedal 110 of the second embodiment and bicycle pedal 10 of the first embodiment, this second embodiment will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein. Rather, only those features which significantly differ from the first embodiment will be described herein.<br>
While the above is a description of various embodiments of the present invention, further modifications may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the shape of the cleat engagement members is not limited to that in the above embodiments, and the present invention can also be applied to cleats of other configurations. The configuration and position of the biasing means for biasing the tread cage and the linking can take many different forms. Similarly, the structure and position of the brace member are not limited to those in the above embodiment. The present invention can also be applied to a shoe in which the cleat projects out from the shoe sole, as in the case of a road-racing shoe. Since the sole of a shoe such as this is usually made from a relatively hard synthetic resin, the effect of the present invention at preventing looseness will be even better compared to a mountain bike shoe.<br>
