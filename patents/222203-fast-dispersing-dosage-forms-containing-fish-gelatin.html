				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to  pharmaceutical compositions. In particular the invention relates to freeze-dried fast-dispersing dosage forms containing fish gelatin<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Fast-dispersing dosage forms which are designed to release the active ingredient in the oral cavity are well known and can be used to deliver a wide range of drugs   Many such fast-dispersing dosage forms utilize gelatin as a carner  Gelatin B P , which is normally utilized in such formulations, is defined as a protein obtained by partial hydrolysis of animal collagenous tissues such as skin, tendons ligaments and bones, with boiling water  However, such mammalian derived gelatin has an unpleasant taste and thus necessitates the use of sweeteners and flavors in such fast-dispersing dosage forms to mask the taste of the gelatin in addition to any sweeteners and flavors which may be required to mask the taste of the active ingredient Moreover, when conventional mammalian derived gelatin is used in tne production of such fast-dispersing dosage forms, it is necessary to heat the gelatin solution to 60°C in order to effect solution   This heating step increases processing times and incurs heating costs thereby increasing the overall costs of the process<br>

While che prior an is replete wuh methods and techniques for the preparation of rapidly dispersing dosage forms, it has failed to consider che benefits associated with the use of fish gelatin, especially non-gelling, non-hydrolyzed fish gelatin, in such dosage forms   The pharmaceutical indusxry would be able to avoid the use of mammalian derived gelatin due to taste considerations   Thus, there exists the need for improved fasi-dispcrsing dosage forms which are designed to quickly release the active ingredient in the oral cavit  chat avoid the use of mammalian derived gelatin<br>
Summary of  the Invention<br>
It  has now been found that many of the problems associated with the use of mammalian-denved gelatin can be overcome if fish gelatin, especially non-gelling fish gelatin, is utilized for preparing fasc-dispersmg dosage forms   Surprisingly, the non-gelling form of fish gelatin from sources such as cold water fish can be advantageously used in rapidly disintegrating dosage forms   Moreover, a number of further advantages have been identified in terms of processing paramefers and the qualities of the resultant producl<br>
The present invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a carner and an active ingredient (e g , drug, compound, and the like) wherein the earner is fish gelatin and the composition is in the form of a fast-dispersing dosage form which releases the active ingredient rapidly on contact with a fluid (c g , saliva, bodily fluids, water, and the like)   Preferably, the composition is designed for oral administration and releases the active ingredient rapidly in the oral cavity  In another embodiment, the composition can be applied topically for instance, to wee skin, or dispersed or dissolved in a liquid pnor to topical or oral administration<br>
The invention also discloses a process for preparing fast-dispersing dosage forms by freeze-drying or lyophilizing a combination of the active ingredient and fish gelatin (e g , non-gelling fish gelatin)<br>
The invention further includes a method of using fish gelatin (e g , non-gelling fish gelatin) in pharmaceutical compositions in fast dispersing dosage form, and m particular, freeze dned fast-dispersing dosage forms<br>
[n a preferred embodiment the comoosition of the invention is a solid fast dispersing dosage form containing a network, of che active ingredient ana a j/acer-soluble or water-aisoersible earner compnsing fish gelatin (e g   non-gelling fish gelatin), the network having been obtained by subliming solvent from a composition in the solid state containing the active ingredient and a solution or dispersion of the earner in a solvent<br>
The fish gelatin used in accordance with cite invention is preferably obtained from cold water fish sources and is the non-gelJing type of fish gelatin   More preferably, the non-hydrolyzed form of non-gelling fish gelatin is used   In an alternative embodiment, spray-dned non-hydrolyzed non-gelling fish gelatin can be used<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The phxase "fast-dispersing dosage form" refers to compositions which disintegrate or disperse within 1 to 60 seconds, preferably I to 30 seconds, more preferably 1 to 10 seconds and particularly 2 to 8 seconds, after being placed in contacc with a. fluid," The fluid is preferably that found in the oral cavity, i e , saliva, as with oral administration   In a general context the phrase encompasses all the previously mentioned dosage forms described herein as well as any other equivalent dosage form<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of che invention are solid fast-dispersing dosage forms compnsing a solid network of the active ingredient and a<br>
water-soluble or water -disperstole earner concaining fish gelatin   Accordingly, the came  is inert towards the active ingredient   The network, is obtained bv subliming solvent from a composition m the solid state the composition comprising che active ingredient and a solution oftne earner in the solvent   Tne dosage forms according to che invention can be prepared according to tne process disclosed in Gregory et al, UK Patent No   1,548,022 using fish gelatin as the earner<br>
Accordingly, an initial composition (or admixture) comprising the active ingredient and a solution of the fish gelatin earner in a solvent is prepared followed by sublimation   The sublimation is preferably earned out by freeze drying che composition   The composition can be contained in a mold during the freeze-arymg process to produce a solid form in any desired shape   The mold can be cooled using liquid nitrogen or solid carbon dioxide m a preliminary step pnor to the deposition of the composition therein.   After freezing the mold and composition, they are next subjected to reduced pressure and, if desired, controlled application of heat to aid in sublimation of solvent   The reduced pressure applied  in the process can be below about 4 mm Hg, preferably below about 0 3 mm Hg   The freeze dned compositions can then be removed from the mold if desired or stored therein until later use<br>
When che process is used with active ingredients and fish gelatin as the earner, a solid fast-dispersing dosage form is produced having the advantages associated with the use of fish gelatin described herein   Generally, fish gelatin is categonzed as being from cold water and warm water fish sources and as being of the gelling or non-gelling vanety   The non-gelling vanety of Fish gelaun, in companson to gelling fish<br>
gelatin and boMne gelatin, contains lower proline and hydroxyprolme ammo acid content which arc known to be associated with cross-linking properties and gelling ability   Non-gelling fish gelatin can remain at solution concentrations of UD to about 40% as well as in cemperacures as low as 20° C   The fish gelatin used in accordance with the invention is preferably obtained from cold water fish sources and is the non-gelling type of fish gelatin   More preferably, che non-hydroIyzed form of non-gelling fish gelatin is used   In an alternative embodiment, spray-dned non-hvdrolyzed non-gelhng fish gelatin can be used   Fish geiacins suitable for use in che invention can be obtained from Croda Colloids Ltd (Chestre, England), for example<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Despite the comparatively lower oroline and hvdrcuyproline concent and other differences in non-gelling fisn ge"aun as compared to gelling fish gelatin and bovine gelatin, non-gelling fish gelatin can be successfully used in a matrix for preparing fast-dispersing dosage forms in accordance with the invention<br>
The composition according co the invention can also contain, in addition to the active ingredient and fish gelatin earner other matrix forming agents and secondary components   Matrix forming agents suitable foruse in the present invention include materials derived from animal or vegetable proteins, such as other gelatins, dectirins and soy, wheat and psyllium seed proteins, gums such as acacia, guar, agar and xanthan, polysaccharides, alginates, carboxymethylcelluloses, carrageenans, dextrans, pectins, synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polypeptide/protem or polysaccharide complexes such as gelatin-acacia complexes<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
 Comparative Tensile Strenth  and Dispersion Testing<br>
The units produceo in Example 1 ana the Comparative Examples A tarougn C were subjected to tensile strength and disintegration tests according to methods conforming to (he USP monograph requirements   An additional dispersion test was also earned out to identify any subtle differences which may not be apparent from the disintegration test.<br>
The dispersion test was performed by,adding 500 ml volume of purified water into a glass beaker   The water was then heated to a temperature of 37° C   The units were carefully drooped onco the surface of the water and the time taken to fully disperse noted   The water was then changed for subsequent unit testing<br>
Results<br>
The units produced in Example I exhibited a disintegration time of 0 85 seconds and gave a mean tensile strength value of 0 267 N mm "   In contrast, the units produced in Comparative Example A exhibited a disintegration time of 4 28 seconds and had a mean tensile strength value of 0 408 N mm 2   The disp"ersion test confirmed these results   The units produced in Comparative Examples B and C exhibited a mean tensile strength of 0 407 U mm 2 and 0 433 N mm 2 respectively   In addition, it was noted that the units produced tn Example 1 had no unpleasant smell or taste and a better mouth-feel than the units produced <br> the Comparative Examples<br>
In particular, the units of Comparative Examples B and C were slow 10 disperse and had a gummy mouth-feel<br>
It is apparent from cne above chat fast-disoersmg dosage forms produced using fish gelatin have a numoer of advantages over those produced using mammalian-denved gelatin   For instance, such dosage forms containing fish gelatin have a faster disintegration time, a better caste and a becter moudvfeel than dosage forms containing mammalian derived gelatin   Moreover, there is no need for sweeteners and flavors to be added to mask the taste or smell of the gelatin since fish gelatin has an acceptable taste and smell   Thus, although some sweeteners and flavors may still be required co mask the taste of an unpalatable active ingredient, the overall quantity of sweeteners and flavors can be greatly reduced with attendant cost benefits   In addition, since fish gelacin is soluble in cold water the heating step, which is required when mammalian denved gelatin is used, can be omitted thereby productng cost savings in heating costs and shorter mixing times   The overall process is therefore more controllable when fish gelacin is used in olace of mammalian denved gelatin The following examples further exemplify formulations which can be prepared using the process described in Example I.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
 Testing of "Gelling" Fish Gelatin<br>
A formulation containing "gelling" fish gelatin was prepared ana evaluated for disintegration time and mouin feel   Gelatin, mannitol and ounfied water were weighed into plastic vessels   The gelatin and mannuol were added 10 the vortex of continually stirred purified water, and the mixture was heated to a temperature of 60°C in order to effect solution of  t.he gelatin   Once dissolved, the solution was then cooled to a temperature of about 23 4° C prior to dosing   All quo cs of 500 mg were dosed into pre-formed blister pockets and frozen, stored and freeze-dned<br>
A total batch of 100 grams was prepared containing the following formulation<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The dosage forms were analyzed for disintegration time and mouth feel Disintegration time of the samples was measured according to USP methods  The samples had disintegration times of greater than 5 seconds   The mouth feel of the samples was found to be slow to disperse, "gummy " in nature, and overall unsatisfactory.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for improved dosage forms chat are economical  to  produce and avoic problems associated with mammalian gelatin  Tne cosage forms according to the presenc indention addresses tnese needs and does so with superior results<br>
The invention has been aescnbed with reference co various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques   However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications can be made while remaining within the spine and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
