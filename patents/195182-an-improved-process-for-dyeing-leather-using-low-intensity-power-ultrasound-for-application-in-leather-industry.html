				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for dyeing leather using low intensity power ultrasound for application in leather industry. This has potential use in the dye yard of leather tanning industry for dyeing any leather with even shade as well as full penetration even at room-temperature at the cost of very low energy consumption even without the aid of conventional drumming or mechanical action.<br>
As reported by Kirk ( Chemistry and Technology of Leather, edited by O'Flaherty, W.T.Roddy and R.M.Lollar, Robert E.Krieger publishing company, New York, volume 3, chapter 3, p-1, 1978), leather is colored not only to improve its appearance, but also to make it adaptable for fashion styling with an ultimate objective to increase its value as a commodity. It is conventionally done either during post tanning wet operation by drum dyeing method or during finishing operation by brush or spray dyeing. Conventional methods however also include carrying out of dyeing operation even in paddles.<br>
The most prevalent method of dyeing leather in the post tanning bath, as mentioned by Sharphouse ( Leather Technicians' Handbook, published by Leather producers' Association, Northampton, U.K, p-304, 1983), is the drum dyeing, wherein the leather is dyed at 60 - 80°C in drums made of wood or steel fitted with hollow axle through which dye solutions and auxiliary agents are added v- lile rotating the drum at 12 to 1b rpm. Float of the bath a ,d pH of leather are however adjusted depending on the nature of dye used, extent<br>
of dyeing requirements in terms of penetration, shade etc. before adding dye to the bath. Crust leathers are also conventionally dyed by drum dyeing method in similar way after wetting back the same using ammonia and wetting agents.<br>
Paddle is a curve shaped tank made up of wood or concrete in which mechanical agitation is caused by the rotation of circular wooden blades fitted at the axle of the tank. The paddle dyeing is usually used for fragile leathers like book-binding leathers, skivers and shearlings which are likely to be damaged by the vigorous action of drum. The float used for paddle dyeing is usually considerably higher compared to that used in conventional drum dyeing.<br>
As reported by Ludvik ( Study on scope for decrease of pollution load in Leather industry, A report on assistance in pollution control in the tanning industry in South-East Asia, prepared by United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, p-15, 1997), the main limitation of the conventional processes is that external heating arrangement is to be made to ensure that the dyeing operation is carried out at around 60°C for better result. Moreover, full penetration required for certain categories of leather requires the duration of dyeing to be extended even upto 5 hours, whereby the leather quality is likely to be affected due to more mechanical action. Another major drawback of the hitherto known conventional methods is that tfre';exhaustionipf:dye in the bath is only in the range of 50-75%, resulting in the presence of substantial amount of unused dye in the spent liquor, thereby<br>
causing not only an enormous wastage from the economical point of view, but also the creation of environmental problems.<br>
The ill-effects of mechanical action and the problem of external heating may be overcome by spray dyeing method, whereby a dye solution of required shade is sprayed on the leather. This method is, however, suitable only for surface dyeing and is usually employed in the finishing stage. The above limitations have prompted the researchers to try the option of power ultrasound for dyeing leather. Ultrasound, which is a sound wave with frequency above 16kHz, the human audible range, is produced by ultrasonic transducers, which convert electrical signals of ultrasonic frequency to mechanical vibrations of the same frequency. As reported by Contamine et al (Chemical Engineering Science, 49(248), 5865, 1994) the ultrasound at a frequency range of 20-1000 kHz is known as power ultrasound, which is now well known to have significant effects on the rate of various processes in the chemical industry such as cleaning, homogenisation, emulsification, extraction, partiele:size reduction etc. The power applied to the transducer is available as ultrasonic energy over a working area, while the energy available per unit of working area of the ultrasonic equipment is known as the ultrasonic intensity.<br>
Although it is non-conventional, yet the power ultrasound can be employed durfago leather dyeing to accelerate the penetration of dye through the cross-section of leather?and facilitate dyeing, unlike conventional methods, even at<br>
stationary condition and at room-ternperature. As reported by Crawford (Ultrasonic Engineering, Butterworths scientific publication, London, Chapter. 8, P-184,1960), dyeing in presence of power ultrasound is carried out in a ultrasound cleaning tank or by immersing ultrasonic horn inside the dye bath, kept in a dyeing vessel.<br>
Cujan et al (Leder Waren, 19(4), 180, 1984) used power ultrasound of intensity in the range of 4 -25 W/cm2 at a frequency in the range of 19-23kHz for dyeing cow leather with cross sectional area of 2 xlO"4 cm2 with an inference that it is possible to reduce the duration of dyeing by adopting ultrasonic technique. Xie et al (Proceedings of the International Union of Leather Technologists' and Chemists Societies Congress, London, p-584-599,1997) used a comparatively lower ultrasonic intensity of 1.36 W/cm2 at 38Khz frequency for dyeing cow leather with 4%w/w, dye based on leather weight to achieve an uptake of maximum 3mgs of dye per grn of leather, resulting in an exhaustion of dye to the extent of 7.5%, after a period of 3 hrs of dyeing.<br>
It is pertinent to mention here that only acid dyes have been used in the hitherto known processes of ultrasonic dyeing. Although such dyes of much bigger particle size as direct dye, metal complex dye are presently preferred for dyeing of leather to get better result in terms of shade, fastness etc, no prior art is available on the use of these dyes for dyeing leather-using pewer ultrasound.<br>
Another major limitation of the hitherto known ultrasonic dyeing of leather is that the high ultrasonic intensity, used in the process results not only in high energy consumption, but also in the enormous rise of temperature of the dye bath resulting in possible damage to certain kind of leather having low shrinkage temperature. Moreover, higher intensity of power ultrasound may also result in the rupture of the leather, damaging its quality. Yet another major drawback of the hitherto known ultrasonic dyeing is that the exhaustion level of the bath is much less compared to that achieved by conventional drum dyeing methods and this is perhaps the major factor which is responsible for discouraging the leather dyers to switch over to the non-conventional option of ultrasonic method of dyeing.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
process for dyeing leather using low intensity power ultrasound for application<br>
in leather industry, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use power ultrasound of<br>
intensity below 0.5 W/ cm2 for dyeing leather.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process of<br>
dyeing leather using dyes of bigger particle size like direct dye and rnetal<br>
complex dye.<br>
Still1 another objective of the present invention is to  provide a process to<br>
achieve more exhaustion of dye compared to that achieved in the hitherto<br>
known methods, to reduce wastage as well as pollution problem.<br>
Accordingly  the   present invention   provides an improved   process for<br>
dyeing leather using low intensity power ultrasound for application in leather<br>
industry, which comprises<br>
i) washing the leather by conventional method,<br>
ii) adjusting the pH of the leather in the range of 4 -6.5,<br>
iii) dyeing the leather, as formed in step (ii), at a maximum ultrasonic intensity<br>
of 0.5 W/cm2, either continuously or with pulsing, at maximum temperature of<br>
60°C,<br>
iv) fixing the dye by conventional method over a period of 20-60 min.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the leather used may be such<br>
as chrome tanned leather, stripped and bleached vegetable tanned leather,<br>
semi chrome leather, crust leather.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the chemicals used for<br>
adjusting the pH may be such as   sodium formate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
neutralising syntans, borax, sodium thiosulphate, either individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the dye used may be<br>
such as   acid dye, direct dye, metal complex dye, either individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the float used for<br>
dyeing may be in?the range of 100-3000% by volume offwater on leather<br>
weight.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, pH for dye fixation<br>
may be in the range of 3.5-4.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the dye fixing agent<br>
used may be such as formic acid, acetic acid either individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of dye<br>
fixing agent may be in the range of 40-80%w/w, on the amount of dye used.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the ultrasonic dyeing<br>
bath may be used in a condition such as static or dynamic or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the ultrasonic<br>
frequency used may be maximum 100 kHz.<br>
Leather is washed by conventional method and pH of the leather is adjusted in the range of 4-6.5 by known method. Dyeing is then done in a fresh float of •100r300©% by: volume of water on the weight of leather using dye in presence of ultrasound at a maximum intensity of 0.5 W/em2 with ultrasonic frequency of maximum 100kHz over a period depending upon the dyeing parameters like shade, type and thickness of leather, penetration requirement, type of dye, etc, either continuously or with pulsing, at a temperature of maximum 60°C in an ultrasonic tank, in a condition, either i static-sondynamic or a combination thereof. The resulting leather is checked fort;penetration of dye by cutting a cross section and then treated with 40-<br>
8Q%w/w, of dye fixing agent on the amount of dye used over a period of 20-60minutes. Finally the leather is taken out of the ultrasonic bath for the subsequent operations by conventional method.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in selecting an ultrasonic intensity range below 0.5 W/cm2 for dyeirag of leather resulting not only in the dye uptake to a level as high as 85% or more in three hours even maintaining the dye bath in stationary condition, registering a substantial increase in dye-uptake over the hitherto known processes, both conventional and non-conventional, but also enabling the leather to be dyed even with such dyes of bigger particle size as direct dye and metal complex dye, which have not been reported in the prior art, thereby providing am improved eeo*friendly method; to Use dye of any particle size for dyeing, that results in maximum dye exhaustion adding little to the load of effluent at the cost of lesser energy consumption.<br>
The following examples are given fcy way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
A circular piece of 9 cm diameter, which was cut from a chrome tanned cow leather, shaved to? a thickness of 1.2 mm, was weighed and the weight was<br>
noted to be 6.074g. The leather cut piece was washed with three changes of plain water in a beaker and then taken in a 1000ml beaker containing 60.7ml water. 60.74mg of sodium formate was separately dissolved in 0.6 ml of water taken in a beaker and the same was added to the beaker containing the leather cut piece while stirring the contents continuously with a mechanical stirrer. After a period of SOminutes, an aqueous solution of 60.74mg of sodium bi carbonate, dissolved in 0.6 ml of water was added to the beaker in 3 feeds at 10 minutes interval with continuous stirring, which was continued for another 1 hr after adding the final installment. pH of the cross section of the leather was found to be 6.0. The bath was then drained and the leather was washed with two changes of plain water.<br>
This washed leather was then taken in a glass process beaker containing 36.4ml of plain water at 30°C and the beaker was positioned at the centre of an ultrasonic tank by clamping it at a height of 2 cm. from the base of the tank. 243mg of Acid Red dye was dissolved in 24.3ml of water at 30°C and the resulting dye solution was added to the process beaker, positioned in the ultrasonic tank, which was filled with 2.5 litres of water. Ultrasound was switched on to generate ultrasonic output power of 150W with frequency of 33 kHz, generated by the transducers fixed at the bottom waJI of the ultrasonic tank of area 317.25cm2, thereby producing ultrasound with 0.473 W/cm-2- intensity. After 15 minutes, the instrument was switched off for Srninutes and then again switched on for 15 minutes. This process cycle<br>
was continued for   four times. A cross section of the leather was cut and penetration of dye was noted to be thorough.<br>
0.12g of 80% formic acid was dissolved in 1.2ml of water taken in a beaker and was added to the dye bath at the end of fourth cycle in three feeds with 7minutes interval for dye fixation, while continuing the process of ultrasonication in the similar way for a period of 40 minutes. Then the pH of the dye bath was found to be 3.5 and the ultrasouiad was switched of!. The resulting dyed leather was taken out of the process beaker. Finally the leather piece was washed well in plain water and then taken for subsequent fatliquoring operation.<br>
Exhaustion of dye in the bath was calculated to be 88% on the amount of dye added to the bath. The leather was also subjected to physical testing. Tensile strength was found to be 215 kg/cm2, tear strength was found to be 46 kg/cm, while the elongation at break was determined to be 45%. The grain of the leather was found to crack at a load of 62 k§ while the distension at grain crack was found to be 12 mm.<br>
