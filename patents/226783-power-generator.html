				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a power generator for mounting inside a<br>
pneumatic tyre. The invention is particularly suitable for a vehicle tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus, for supplying power to a telemetry unit for<br>
transmitting data from the tyre.<br>
It is known to provide a tyre monitoring apparatus for measuring the<br>
pressure within vehicle tyres.<br>
The tyre monitoring apparatus may also measure other parameters within a<br>
tyre environment, such as the local temperature of a tyre. The measured data<br>
is transmitted, for example via a radio wave link, to the cabin of the vehicle<br>
where it is electronically processed before being displayed to the vehicle<br>
driver. This enables the recipient of the transmitted data to monitor changes<br>
in the condition of the tyre, for example to reduce damage to the tyre (s) of a<br>
vehicle, or to predict tyre failure. This is of particular advantage at high<br>
vehicle speeds, when the environment within a tyre is at its most hostile and<br>
the likelihood of damage to a tyre and, indeed, injury to the occupants of the<br>
vehicle, is at its greatest.<br>
The majority of existing tyre monitoring apparatus uses a battery<br>
as the power source, which is located on or within a wheel or<br>
tyre. Such arrangements have several undesirable limitations, for<br>
example limited battery life and size or weight which can be<br>
accommodated within a tyre. This can have a further undesirable knock<br>
on effect, in that if there is a limited power source available, for example as<br>
a result of weight implications, be number and frequency of data<br>
transmissions that can be relayed for processing is compromised.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to reduce or substantially obviate the<br>
disadvantages referred to above.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a power generator for<br>
mounting inside a pneumatic tyre, the power generator including a<br>
piezoelectric element, an actuating mass arranged for contact with the<br>
piezoelectric element and control circuitry in electrical communication with<br>
the piezoelectric element, in which the actuating mass is arranged to deflect<br>
the piezoelectric element in response to external forces acting on the<br>
actuating mass in use to generate an electrical charge, characterized in that<br>
the control circuitry forms at least part of the actuating mass.<br>
Conveniently, the power generator includes a housing for the piezoelectric<br>
element, actuating mass and control circuitry, the housing being adapted to<br>
be mounted within a pneumatic tyre.<br>
An exterior surface of the housing may have a substantially arcuate profile<br>
adapted for bonding to an arcuate interior surface of a vehicle tyre. An<br>
exterior surface of the housing may include an external profile for<br>
complimentary engagement with the internal pattern of a vehicle tyre.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the housing is releasably mounted on a footing<br>
adapted to be bonded to the internal wall of a tyre, which may be by means<br>
of clips.<br>
The footing preferably includes air channels for allowing movement of air<br>
about the housing, in use.<br>
Preferably, the maximum deflection of the piezoelectric element under<br>
action of the actuating mass is limited by a portion of the housing.<br>
Conveniently, the housing includes abase wall, and the piezoelectric element<br>
is supported on the housing with a central region of the element spaced apart<br>
from the base wall, and in which the base wall serves to limit the maximum<br>
deflection of the piezoelectric element.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the piezoelectric element is in the form of a<br>
piezoceramic disc, preferably having a radius R, and being mounted on a<br>
supporting disc having a radius greater than R.<br>
Preferably, the actuating mass includes an actuator movably mounted in the<br>
housing and adapted for contact with the piezoelectric element. The actuator<br>
may include a projection, provided for contact with the piezoelectric<br>
element, which may be elongate. In a preferred embodiment, the projection<br>
contacts a central region of the piezoelectric element, and may be arranged<br>
for diametrical contact with the disc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the control circuitry is mounted on the actuator.<br>
In a further embodiment, the housing includes a cap adapted for movement<br>
with the actuator, and the control circuitry is mounted on the cap.<br>
Preferably, the control circuitry is encased in a potting compound which also<br>
contributes to the actuating mass.<br>
The control circuitry may include sensor circuitry for monitoring<br>
environment parameters local to the housing.<br>
The power generator may form part of a telemetry unit and the control<br>
circuitry includes sensor circuitry for monitoring environment parameters<br>
local to the unit.<br>
The control circuitry preferably includes a low power consumption protocol,<br>
for minimizing consumption of the generated power.<br>
The invention is advantageous in that it provides a power generator which is<br>
suitable for supplying power to a remote telemetry apparatus for transmitting<br>
data from inside the harsh environment of a rotating pneumatic tyre, which<br>
obviates the need for a battery.<br>

FIGURE 9 is a cross-sectional view through the unit of Figures 6 to 8;<br>
FIGURE 10 shows an end view of the unit of Figures 6 to 9 in use in a<br>
pneumatic tyre; and<br>
FIGURE 11 is a side view of the unit as shown in Figure 10.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4, a power generator/sensor unit is indicated<br>
generally at 10, for use in a tyre monitoring apparatus. The unit 10 includes<br>
a housing 12 made as a reinforced injection moulding composite for<br>
mounting in and adapted to withstand the harsh environment of pneumatic<br>
vehicle tyre. Although the housing 102 is described as being made as a<br>
composite moulding, any suitable material can be used.<br>
The housing 12 has a base or footing 16 having a shallow convex outer<br>
profile, indicated at C in Figure 2, for bonding to a correspondingly arcuate<br>
interior surface of a vehicle tyre. The base 16 defines a chamber, indicated at<br>
18 in Figure 1, having an internal base wall 20.<br>
The unit 10 includes a piezoelectric element 11 in the form of a<br>
piezoceramic disc 14 having a radius R, which is mounted centrally on a<br>
brass supporting disc 15 having a radius greater than R.<br>
The element 11 is mounted in the housing 12 for generating electrical power<br>
to operate circuitry within the unit 10.<br>
The base 16 of the housing 12 includes two opposed recesses 22, one of<br>
which can be seen clearly in figure 1, for supporting part of the periphery of<br>
the brass disc 15. When supported on the base 16, the central portion of the<br>
brass disc 15 is spaced apart from the base wall 20 by a small distance. A<br>
cover 26 is received on the base 16, which overlays the part of the periphery<br>
of the brass disc 15 supported on the recesses 22, such that the disc is<br>
clamped between the cover 26 and the recesses 22 along two edge portions<br>
47.<br>
A cap 28 is provided over the cover 26, the cap including a central formation<br>
30, which extends through a central aperture 27 in the cover 26.<br>
A printed circuit board (PCB) 32 is mounted in the housing 12 on the cap<br>
28. As shown in Figure 5A, the PCB 32 includes a micro processor, a radio<br>
frequency (RF) transmitter, pressure and temperature sensor circuitry,<br>
including pressure and temperature sensors, and supervision and control<br>
circuitry, which form part of a tyre monitoring apparatus. The PCB 32 also<br>
includes a rectifier for converting an alternating current output from the<br>
piezoceramic disc 14 into a direct current output; an energy storage element<br>
in the form of a series of a capacitors, which store the direct current output<br>
from the rectifier until required, and A DC-DC controller which is provided<br>
for regulating voltage output from the capacitors. The preferred embodiment<br>
uses ultra low leakage type capacitors, to ensure that as high a percentage of<br>
the generated charge is retained as possible and that internal leakage is kept<br>
to a minimum.<br>
The PCB 32 is in electrical communication with the piezoceramic disc 14<br>
via two wires, not shown, and is securably located on the cap 28 by a potting<br>
compound 34, to protect the PCB 32 during installation or transit, and from<br>
the harsh environment within a rotating pneumatic tyre. The potting<br>
compound 34 can be any suitable type but in this embodiment is a two-part<br>
epoxy adhesive.<br>
An actuator 36 is disposed between the piezoceramic disc 14, the cover 26<br>
and the cap 28, the actuator consisting of an integrally formed foot 38 and a<br>
stem 40. The stem 40 extends into the central formation of the cap 28 and<br>
includes a central bore 42. As can be seen clearly in figure 2, the foot 38<br>
includes an integrally formed elongate projection or nose 44, which is in<br>
contact with the piezoceramic element. The nose 44 extends diametrically<br>
across the piezoelectric element 11, as indicated in Figure 4, which shows<br>
the contact area 45 of the nose 44 on the piezoelectric element 11 and the<br>
areas of support 47 for the disc 15 on the base 16. It will be appreciated that<br>
the piezoelectric element 11 is configured substantially as a simply<br>
supported beam, supported on one side by the recesses 22 in the base 16 and<br>
contactable on its opposite side by the nose 44 of the actuator 36.<br>
The actuator 36 is connected to the cap 28 by a screw 46, which passes<br>
through the cap 28 and is securably received in the bore 42 of the stem 40.<br>
The base 16 is connected to the cover 26 by four screws 48, which pass<br>
through the corners of the base 16 and which are securably received in the<br>
cover 26.<br>
The arrangement is such that the piezoelectric element 11 can be deflected<br>
downwardly (as viewed in Figure 2) under the influence of the actuator 36,<br>
as will be described in more detail below.<br>
However, the maximum deflection of the piezoelectric element 11 is limited<br>
by the distance between the underside of the brass disc 15 and the internal<br>
base wall 20, set at 0.4 mm in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4. Thus, the<br>
element 11 is protected against excess deflection, which might otherwise<br>
damage the structure and charge generating capacity of the element 11. The<br>
movement of the actuator 36 within the housing 12 in the opposite direction,<br>
1. e. perpendicularly away from the piezoceramic disc 14, upwards as viewed<br>
in figure2, is restricted by walls 27 of the cover 26.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4, the maximum distance between the<br>
upper side of the foot 38 of the actuator 36 and the walls 21 of the cover26 is<br>
0.6 mm when the power generator 10 is in the rest position shown in Figure<br>
2. Hence, the maximum travel of the actuator 36 within the housing 12 is 1<br>
mm in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4. This maximum distance of travel<br>
of the actuator 36 within the housing 12 is set at a predetermined low value<br>
to protect the piezoceramic disc 14 from damage due to deflection and/or<br>
impact of the actuator 36 on the upper surface of the piezoceramic disc 14 in<br>
use. It will be understood that the maximum travel of the actuator and<br>
deflection of the piezoelectric element can be limited to any distance suitable<br>
for protecting the integrity of the structure and charge generating capacity of<br>
the piezoelectric element.<br>
The arrangement of the piezoceramic disc 14, in combination with the<br>
components of the PCB 32 which are associated with the piezoceramic disc<br>
14, as described above, form part of a power generator in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, for supplying power for the circuitry<br>
of the unit 10.<br>
Operation of the power generator will now be described, by way of example,<br>
in which the unit 10 is mounted in a pneumatic tyre on the wheel of a<br>
vehicle, with the outer surface of the base 16 of the housing 12 bonded to a<br>
correspondingly arcuate profile of an interior surface of the tyre, and in<br>
which the unit 10 includes a piezoceramic disc 14 of any suitable known<br>
construction.<br>
It will be appreciated that mechanical excitation of the disc 14 generates a<br>
voltage. The effect is substantially linear, i. e. the electric field generated<br>
varies directly with the applied mechanical stress, and is direction<br>
dependent, so that compressive and tensile stresses generate voltages of<br>
opposite polarity.<br>
The cap 28, PCB 32, potting compound 34 and the actuator 36 act on the<br>
disc 14 as a single unit mass, in use, i. e. with the cap, actuator, circuitry and<br>
potting compound acting as a composite actuating mass. When the wheel is<br>
in rotation, centrifugal forces act on the cap 28, PCB 32 and the potting<br>
compound 34, which urge the actuator 36 radially outwards in the direction<br>
of the piezoelectric element 11. This centrifugal action on the actuator 36<br>
causes the piezoelectric element 11 to deflect, typically between 0.2 to 0.4<br>
mm at its central region 45 from a rest position when the wheel is not in<br>
rotation. Since the piezoelectric element 11 acts as a simply supported beam<br>
and the nose 44 of the actuator 36 is in contact with the disc 14 at the central<br>
position 45 between the area of support for the brass disc 15, the deflection<br>
is in the form of a uniform bending of the discs 14 and 15 between the two<br>
areas of support 47 of the brass disc 15.<br>
It will be understood that, as the vehicle is in motion, the external area of the<br>
tyre adjacent the unit 10 comes in to contact with the surface along which<br>
the vehicle is travelling, once with every revolution of the wheel. This<br>
contact deforms the area of the tyre adjacent the unit, which deformation is<br>
transmitted to the power generator, ultimately in the form of a deformation<br>
of the piezoelectric element 11 by the actuator 36. Hence, the piezoceramic<br>
disc 14 is subjected to variations in mechanical excitation during rotation of<br>
the wheel on the road surface, whereby each excitation results in a potential<br>
difference being generated by the piezoceramic disc 14. This process is set<br>
out below, with reference to a rotating wheel, starting from a position where<br>
the area of the tyre adjacent the unit 10 is moving towards contact with a<br>
road surface.<br>
With the wheel in rotation, the actuator 36 is in contact with the<br>
piezoceramic disc 14, under centrifugal action from the cap 28, PCB 32 and<br>
potting compound 34, as described above. The piezoceramic disc 14<br>
therefore experiences a substantially constant deflection under the<br>
centrifugal forces, which are transmitted through the actuator 36. As the<br>
wheel rotates further, the area of the tyre adjacent the unit 10 comes into<br>
contact with the road surface and deforms. The deformation results in a<br>
deacceleration of the tyre in the region of the point of contact with the road<br>
surface, causing a sudden reduction in the centrifugal forces experienced by<br>
the actuator 36, almost instantaneously, substantially to zero. This change in<br>
centrifugal acceleration causes a reduction in the deflection experienced by<br>
the piezoceramic disc 14 under action of the actuator 36 and generates a first<br>
pulse of electrical charge, which is communicated to the PCB 32.<br>
As the wheel rotates further, at the instant where the area of the tyre adjacent<br>
the unit 10 moves away from contact with the road surface, the acceleration<br>
of the tyre adjacent the unit 10 increases suddenly, which results in an<br>
instantaneous increase in the centrifugal forces experienced by the actuator<br>
36. Hence, piezoceramic disc 14 is again caused to deflect under centrifugal<br>
action of the actuator 36, cap 28, PCB 32 and potting compound 34, as<br>
described above, which generates a second pulse of electrical charge of<br>
opposite polarity to the first pulse described above, which is communicated<br>
to the PCB 32.<br>
Hence, during a single revolution of the wheel two pulses of electrical<br>
charge, of opposite polarity, are generated in quick succession, constituting a<br>
single alternating current output. The rectifier rectifies the alternating current<br>
output into a direct current output, which is stored in the capacitors for use to<br><br>
power the tyre monitoring apparatus. For each revolution of the wheel, a<br>
small storable electrical charge is generated, typically of 5-10 nano<br>
coulombs.<br>
In addition to the storable charge generated with each revolution of the<br>
wheel due to contact with the road surface, the unit 10 may also transmit<br>
other excitation forces to the piezoelectric element 14, for example<br>
accelerations/deflections which are caused by vibrations due to<br>
imperfections in the road surface, or out of balance forces on the wheel<br>
itself. If the excitation is sufficient to cause deflection of the piezoelectric<br>
disc 14, an additional storable charge will be generated and stored in the<br>
capacitors, as described above.<br>
In some circumstances, the forces acting on the unit 10 inside a vehicle tyre<br>
will not be sufficient to cause uniform bending of the piezoceramic disc 14,<br>
as described above. Instead, the deformation will be in the form of a<br>
localized  squashing  0;of the structure of the disc 14 at the point<br>
of contact with, and in the region immediately adjacent to, the actuator. In<br>
operation, the localised 'squashing' of the disc structure also generates a<br>
potential difference across the element 11, for generating charge<br>
substantially as described above.<br>
The unit 10 is particularly advantageous in that the control circuitry is used<br>
as an actuating mass for the piezoelectric element 11. In the described<br>
embodiment, the weight of the cap 28, the PCB 32 and the potting<br>
compound 34 operate as a single unit to act as an actuating mass/exciter for<br>
the piezoceramic disc 14, without the need for any additional mass. Hence<br>
there is an overall saving in weight in the power generator, to minimise<br>
localized wear caused by the unit 10 adjacent the area of mounting in the<br>
vehicle tyre, and thus reduce the likelihood of a localised bald spot occurring<br>
in the tread of the tyre.<br>
The outer surface C of the base 16 may include an external profile for<br>
complimentary engagement with the internal pattern of a vehicle tyre, to<br>
limit further the effects of localised wear on the tyre, in use.<br>
In order to utilise the small amounts of power generated by the power<br>
generator and to remove the need for a battery backup to power the tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus, an ultra low power consumption protocol is used to<br>
control the consumption of power stored by the capacitors.<br>
Operation of a tyre monitoring apparatus will now be described by way of<br>
example, illustrating the stages which are implemented to ensure that the<br>
optimum low power protocol is realised, starting with the monitoring<br>
apparatus in a 'sleep' mode, with reference to Figure 5. As referred to above,<br>
the tyre monitoring apparatus includes a unit 10 having a piezoelectric<br>
power generator, a microprocessor, a radio frequency (RF) transmitter,<br>
pressure and temperature sensor circuitry and supervision and control<br>
circuitry.<br>
Example 1<br>
Stage 1 The microprocessor is in 'sleep' mode, in which all internal<br>
processing is suspended, apart from a monitor circuit, for monitoring the<br>
'wake up' requirements of the microprocessor. In this embodiment, the<br>
monitor circuit monitors an externally referenced clock in the form of a<br>
crystal oscillator, located outside the microprocessor in the unit. Hence, in<br>
sleep mode, the majority of the microprocessor circuitry is disabled and the<br>
power consumption of the tyre monitoring apparatus is at a minimum level,<br>
for example approximately 24 micro ampere of supply current.<br>
Stage 2 After a predetermined time, in this embodiment 60 seconds, the<br>
monitor circuit 'wakes up' the microprocessor. Upon 'wake up', the<br>
microprocessor switches from the external clock to an internal clock, in the<br>
form of an internal resistor capacitor oscillator. This switch is implemented<br>
to facilitate a higher speed operation of the analogue to digital conversions<br>
and subsequent calculations, which are utilised by the tyre monitoring<br>
apparatus. The switch also initiates power to the internal circuitry of the<br>
microprocessor, which allows the main program of the microprocessor to be<br>
used and to enable the microprocessor to enter a measure and control phase.<br>
Stage 3 Once the microprocessor has 'woken up', power is provided to the<br>
temperature and pressure sensor circuitry. A prescribed time is then allowed<br>
to elapse, in this embodiment 0.5 milliseconds, to facilitate settling of the<br>
sensor circuitry, after which time the microprocessor measures the local<br>
pressure and temperature within the tyre. The values are then stored within<br>
the microprocessor and the power to the sensor circuitry is removed<br>
instantaneously.<br>
Stage 4 The stored pressure and temperature values are concatenated with a<br>
sensor identification and cyclic redundancy check to form a data packet for<br>
transmitting to a receiver unit display unit in the vehicle.<br>
Stage 5 The microprocessor then switches from the internal clock back to<br>
the external clock. This change is employed to ensure accurate time signals<br>
for the transmission of the data via the radio frequency (RF) link, since the<br>
external clock is a quartz crystal time reference unit, which ensures that a<br>
higher absolute frequency accuracy is attainable than with the internal clock.<br>
Stage 6 The microprocessor sets a control line to a logic high OF 3V, which<br>
enables the RF transmitter, thus causing it to emit a radio frequency carrier.<br>
A settling time of approximately 1 millisecond then elapses to facilitate<br>
settling of the RF transmitter components prior to the transmission of data<br>
from the PCB 32. A pseudo bit pattern, used to bias a radio frequency data<br>
slicer, is then concatenated with the sensor identification and cyclic<br>
redundancy check for transmitting. The data to be transmitted is then<br>
frequency modulated onto a 433MHZ radio wave for propagation to the<br>
receiver unit.<br>
Stage 7 The data is transmitted and power to the RF transmitter is then<br>
inhibited instantaneously, at which point the microprocessor then re-enters<br>
 'SLEEP mode'.<br>
Hence, by utilising the low power protocol described in stages 1-7 of the<br>
above example, the tyre monitoring apparatus utilises only a minimum<br>
amount of power from the power generator, to transmit a reading of the local<br>
pressure and temperature within the tyre. After use, the microprocessor<br>
remains in sleep mode for a predetermined period, as referred to in Stage 2<br>
above, while the energy stored in the capacitors is recharged by excitation of<br>
the piezoceramic disc 14, as described with reference to Figures 1 to 4.<br>
Hence, using a continuous cycle of stages 1-7, the tyre monitoring apparatus<br>
is able to monitor the local condition of the tyre, utilising the small electrical<br>
charges generated by the piezoceramic disc 14, without the need for a back-<br>
up battery supply.<br>
The continuous cycles are of advantage during normal operating conditions<br>
of the tyre, whereby any changes in tyre pressure or temperature, which<br>
might indicate a potential problem or failure of the tyre can be monitored, to<br>
avoid a blow out, for example. This has particular advantage at high vehicle<br>
speeds.<br>
Principally, there is a tri-way interdependency of critical factors in the<br>
protocol for the telemetry unit, between the charge generation capability of<br>
the piezoelectric element, the charge storage size and efficiency, and the RF<br>
transmitter reliability governed by the transmitter 'on' time. For a given type<br>
of piezoelectric element, there is an optimum charge capacitance for the<br>
power generator and optimum transmission time for the RF transmitter. The<br>
piezoelectric element must have sufficient charge generation overcome the<br>
impedance of the storage capacitors, and the capacitors must have sufficient<br>
capacitance to hold the charge required to perform the<br>
measurement/transmission cycle. The RF transmitter 'on' time, i. e. when the<br>
transmitter is active and transmitting, must be optimised between a<br>
maximum period in which there is sufficient charge to transmit the data prior<br>
to the energy storage being exhausted, and a minimum period below which<br>
the reliability of the RF link is adversely effected. If transmission time is<br>
extended beyond the optimum period, the effective frequency of data<br>
transmissions is reduced for a given capacitance.<br>
The data transmitted to the in-car receiver unit is shown to the driver of the<br>
vehicle on the display unit for each of the sensor circuits in the tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus, with respect to each tyre of the vehicle. The display<br>
unit informs the driver of the data visually and/or by audible means, for<br>
example a link to the audio system in the vehicle.<br>
Each tyre/wheel of the vehicle is marked by an individual identifying<br>
feature that relates to a specific sensor located within that tyre. This<br>
identifying feature is also represented on the display unit, in combination<br>
with the data from the sensor within the tyre. In the event that the wheel is<br>
moved to another position on the vehicle it can always be related to the<br>
relevant information on the display unit. Suitable identifying features<br>
include colour-coded symbols and alphanumeric symbols.<br>
Each sensor has a unique electronic serial number, which can be used to aid<br>
the security of the radio transmission data. The unique electronic serial<br>
number can also act as an electronic tagging feature for security and anti<br>
counterfeiting purposes.<br>
With reference to the preferred embodiment of the power generator, it has<br>
been described that a storable electrical charge is generated by the<br>
piezoelectric element with each revolution of the vehicle wheel. Therefore, it<br>
will be appreciated that the generation of charge is proportional to the speed<br>
at which the vehicle is travelling. In the above example of the power<br>
consumption protocol, the time delay between transmission of data from the<br>
tyre monitoring apparatus and the "wake up" of the micro processor for<br>
measuring and transmitting a further reading is set to a predetermined value.<br>
In a slow moving vehicle, the electrical charge which is generated and stored<br>
within a predetermined time period is less than would be generated and<br>
stored in a vehicle travelling at a faster speed in the same time period.<br>
Therefore, the time interval between "wake up" of the microprocessor is set<br>
at a predetermined value, selected to allow a sufficient electrical charge to be<br>
generated and stored for measurement and transmission of the parameters of<br>
a tyre on a slow moving vehicle, for example 25 KMH.<br>
However, as the speed of the vehicle increases, the rate of electrical charge<br>
generation also increases. Thus, the time period required to generate<br>
sufficient electrical charge to enable the tyre monitoring system to measure<br>
and transmit the tyre parameters is reduced.<br>
To take advantage of this, the low power protocol described above can be<br>
modified so that the micro processor is "awoken" from its sleep mode at<br>
intervals relative to a function of the speed of the vehicle or the state of the<br>
electrical charge stored in the capacitors, which enables the transmission of<br>
data to be varied in proportion to the speed of the vehicle.<br>
The following example shows a preferred mode of operation, in which the<br>
rate of transmission of data from the tyre monitoring apparatus is<br>
proportional to the speed of the vehicle, starting with the monitoring system<br>
in a "sleep" mode, substantially as described in example 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Stage 1 As the wheel rotates, storable power outputs are produced by the<br>
power generator, one per revolution, as described above. In this example,<br>
this characteristic of the power generator is used to monitor the speed of the<br>
vehicle and/or the state of charge of the capacitors. A small portion of each<br>
storable power output is signal conditioned to take in to consideration false<br>
triggers of power, which may be experienced by the piezoelectric disc 14<br>
during rotation of the wheel, for example accelerations/deflections which are<br>
caused by vibrations due to imperfections in the road surface. The<br>
conditioned signal is then supplied to an interrupt circuit in the<br>
microprocessor, which momentarily wakes the microprocessor from its sleep<br>
mode and increments a counter in the microprocessor. The microprocessor<br>
then returns instantly to the sleep mode.<br>
Stage 2 Both the average charge generated per revolution of the wheel and<br>
the value of stored charge sufficient to measure and transmit data from the<br>
unit 10 are known. Hence, the number of "interrupts" or increments of the<br>
counter required for the capacitors to store a charge sufficient for<br>
measurement and transmission of data from the apparatus can be calculated.<br>
Therefore, the micro processor can be set to "wake up", substantially as<br>
described in stage 2 of example 1, after a predetermined number of<br>
revolutions of the wheel, for example 50 revolutions. At this point, power is<br>
initiated to the internal circuitry of the microprocessor, which allows the<br>
main program of the microprocessor to be used and to enable the<br>
microprocessor to enter a measure and control phase.<br>
The internal clock of the microprocessor monitors the time taken for the<br>
predetermined number of revolutions to be completed. Hence, a value of<br>
average speed of the vehicle during the time period can be calculated from<br>
the elapsed time and the distance travelled which is cross- referenced from a<br>
table of data relating to the diameter of the wheel.<br>
Stage 3 As described in example 1, once the microprocessor has 'woken up',<br>
power is provided to the temperature and pressure sensor circuitry. A<br>
prescribed time is then allowed to elapse, for example 50.0 micro seconds, to<br>
facilitate settling of the sensor circuitry, after which time the microprocessor<br>
measures the local pressure and temperature within the tyre. The values are<br>
then stored within the microprocessor and the power to the sensor circuitry<br>
is removed instantaneously.<br>
Stage 4 The stored pressure and temperature values are concatenated with a<br>
sensor identification and cyclic redundancy check, as described in stage 4 of<br>
example 1, and the value of speed calculated during stage 2.<br>
Further stages 5 to 7 are then carried out substantially as described with<br>
reference to stages 5 to 7 in the above example.<br>
Since the speed of the data transmissions is proportional to the speed of the<br>
vehicle, this mode of operation provides a major safety improvement over<br>
known tyre monitoring apparatus, in that the information is transmitted and<br>
updated regularly, depending on the speed of the vehicle.<br>
This has particular advantage in that a catastrophic failure of a tyre is more<br>
likely to occur, possibly with greater consequences, at high vehicle speed.<br>
The unit 10 is more regularly updated at high vehicle speeds than at lower<br>
speeds, thereby improving vehicle safety by warning the driver of any<br>
deflation of the vehicle tyres, for example.<br>
A further embodiment of power/sensor or telemetry unit is indicated at 100<br>
in Figure 6 to 11, which corresponds substantially to the unit 10 described<br>
above.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the unit 100 includes a housing 112, which consists of<br>
a base portion 116 and a cap 128 mounted on the base portion 116. The<br>
housing 112 is removably mounted on a resilient base or footing 151 made<br>
of a rubber or any other suitable material. A pair of resilient clip arms 153<br>
are pivotably provided on the footing 151, for snap-fitting engagement with<br>
formations 117 on the base portion 116 of the housing 112. The unit 100 can<br>
be simply removed from the footing 151 by unclipping the arms 153 from<br>
their engagement with the formations 117, for repair or installation in<br>
another tyre using a new footing 151, for example.<br>
The footing 151 is adapted to be permanently secured to an internal surface<br>
159 of a tyre, as shown in Figure 10 and 11, and can be disposed of with the<br>
tyre after use. Two air channels 155 are provided in the footing 151, which<br>
have the dual function of allowing air movement about the unit 100, in use,<br>
and providing a footing of sufficient flexibility to aid protection and shock<br>
absorption for the internal components of the unit 100, whilst propagating<br>
the flexure of the tyre during rotation to the internal components of the unit<br>
100.<br>
The footing 151 IS generally elliptical and has a greater surface area than the<br>
base portion 116 of the housing 112. The shape and size of the footing 151 is<br>
designed to spread the load of the unit 100 on a tyre, to reduce adverse tyre<br>
wear in the region of the unit 100, that may otherwise be expected when<br>
providing a localised mass on the inside of a tyre, the mass of the unit 100<br>
being in the region of between 30-50 grams.<br>
Referring specifically to Figures 7 to 9, the internal configuration of the<br>
housing 112 and the internal components of the unit 100 will now be<br>
described.<br>
The unit 100 includes a piezoelectric element 114 mounted on a brass<br>
supporting disc 115, substantially as described with reference to Figures 1 to<br>
4. The base portion 116 of the housing 112 defines a compartment 118<br>
formed by a base wall 120 and a peripheral wall 121.<br>
Recesses 122 are formed in the peripheral wall 121, for supporting a part of<br>
the periphery of the brass disc 115. When supported on the base portion 116,<br>
the central portion of the brass disc 115 is spaced apart from the base wall<br>
120. In this embodiment, tabs 123 are provided which extend over a portion<br>
of the recesses 122, for engagement with the periphery of the brass disc 115,<br>
for retaining the brass disc 115, and thereby the piezoelectric element 114,<br>
on the base portion 116.<br>
The unit 100 includes a one-piece moulded actuator 136 defining a chamber<br>
137, which is movably mounted in the housing 112. A printed circuit board<br>
or PCB (not shown), corresponding to the PCB 32 described with reference<br>
to the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4 is mounted in the chamber 137. The<br>
PCB is in electrical communication with the piezoceramic disc 114 via wires<br>
(not shown), which pass through an aperture 139 in the floor of the chamber<br>
137. The PCB is securely located on the actuator 136 by a potting compound<br>
(not shown), which protects the PCB during installation or transit of the unit<br>
100, as well as from the harsh environment within a rotating pneumatic tyre<br>
in use.<br>
An elongate projection or nose 144 is formed on the underside of the<br>
actuator 136, as can be seen in Figure 8. In a normal rest position in the<br>
housing 112, the nose 144 is in contact with the piezoceramic disc 114, as<br>
can be seen in Figure 9. In the rest position, the underside of the actuator 136<br>
is spaced from an internal surface 141 of the base portion 116 by a distance<br>
of approximately 0.3 mm. In use, the piezoelectric element 114 is deflected<br>
in the direction of the base wall 120 under action of the actuating mass, and<br>
it will be appreciated, therefore, that the maximum deflection is limited to<br>
approximately 0.3 mm, as the periphery of the actuator 136 comes into<br>
contact with the internal surface 141. This maximum deflection is limited to<br>
protect the piezoelectric element 114 from excessive bending, and may be<br>
any suitable distance, for example between 0.2 and 0.5 mm. It will be<br>
appreciated that the components of the PCB and potting compound form part<br>
of an actuating mass for excitation of the piezoelectric element, with the<br>
actuator 136.<br>
The housing 112 is injection moulded from plastics and is adapted to<br>
withstand the harsh environment within a pneumatic vehicle tyre. The<br>
piezoceramic disc 114, and actuator 136 and control circuitry form are thus<br>
part of a power generator for use in a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
The unit 100 operates substantially in the same way as the unit 10, as<br>
described above therefore operation of the unit 100 is not described in<br>
significant detail.<br>
In summary, it will be appreciated that the units 10,100 each serve as a<br>
telemetry unit, which is capable of measuring and transmitting data relevant<br>
to tyre conditions local to the unit.<br>
The concept of mounting an in-tyre telemetry unit to the inner surface of a<br>
tyre by means of a sacrificial footing 151 which can be permanently bonded<br>
to the tyre is not limited to the application with units having a piezoelectric<br>
power generator as described above. The footing can be used with any<br>
suitable telemetry unit. Accordingly, the applicant may claim independent<br>
patent protection to this concept.<br>
