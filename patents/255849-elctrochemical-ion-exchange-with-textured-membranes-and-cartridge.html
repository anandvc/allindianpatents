FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to electrochemical ion exchange with textured<br>
membranes and cartridge background. <br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ion exchange cells are used to remove or replace Ions in solutions, for example,<br>
in the production of high purity water by deionization, in waste water treatment,<br>
and in the selective substitution of Ions in solution. Ion exchange materials<br>
include cation and anion exchange materials that contain replaceable ions or<br>
which chemically react with specific Ions, to exchange captions or anions,<br>
respectively, from a solution stream. A typical conventional Ion exchange cell<br>
comprises Ion exchange resin beads packed into columns and a stream of<br>
solution to be treated is passed through the column. Ions in the solution are<br>
removed or replaced by the ion exchange material, and product solution or waste<br>
emerges from the outlet of the column. When the Ion exchange materials-<br>
overwhelmed with Ions from the solution, the beads are regenerated with a<br>
suitable solution. Caption exchange resins are commonly regenerated using<br>
acidic solutions or salt brine (eg. for water softeners), and anion exchange resins<br>
are most often regenerated with basic solutions or brine.<br>
Electrochemical Ion exchange uses a water-splitting ion exchange membrane<br>
(also known as a bipolar, double, or laminar membrane) positioned between two<br>
facing electrodes with a dielectric spacer between the membranes, as for<br>
example, described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,788,812 (Nyberg)<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in Its entirety. The water splitting<br><br><br>
membranes have both a caption exchange layer and an anion exchange layer.<br>
When a sufficiently high electric field is applied through the membrane by,<br>
applying a voltage to the two electrodes, water is irreversibly dissociated or "split"<br><br>
into component ions H+ and OH- at the boundary between the caption and anion<br>
exchange layers. The resultant H+ and OH- Ions migrate and diffuse through the<br>
ion exchange layers in the direction of the electrode having an opposite polarity<br>
(eg. H+ migrates to the negative electrode). During the regeneration step, the H+<br>
and OH- Ions formed at the membrane interface causes the rejection of captions<br>
and anions removed in a previous deionization step, reforming the acid and base<br>
forms of the caption and anion exchange materials. Electrical regeneration in this<br>
way avoids the use, and subsequent disposal problems, of hazardous chemicals<br>
that are used to regenerate conventional Ion exchange beads.<br>
The Ion exchange membranes of the prior art are typically smooth and flat, and<br>
also often have a uniform cross-sectional thickness, to minimize variations in<br>
current densities across the membranes in electrochemical cells. Also a separate<br>
dielectric spacer, such as a plastic netting material, is typically placed between<br>
the membranes to maintain the membranes at a uniform distance from one<br>
another to further reduce current density variation and maintain consistent mass<br>
transport rates and pressure drops across the gap between the membranes. The<br>
membrane thickness is maintained uniform to provide a constant spacing<br>
between Ion exchange membranes to generate uniform current densities across<br>
membrane surfaces. Various methods can be used to maintain a uniform<br>
thickness on the membrane. The membrane should also be flat and smooth to<br>
facilitate the" backwashing of Ion exchange resins in electrode ionization devices,<br><br><br>
and well as the periodic replacement of these resins. Membranes have a smooth<br>
flat surface also reduces the pressure drop between adjacent membranes.<br>
However, conventional Ion exchange membranes generally provide slower Ion<br>
exchange rates and consequently, slower solution treatment flow rates and<br>
outputs, than conventional Ion exchange bead systems. Consequently, the<br>
membrane systems have limited utility due to space volume versus solution<br>
treatment throughout considerations.<br>
Furthermore, the dielectric spacer layers that are used to separate the<br>
membranes in the electrochemical cells have to be sufficiently thick to be free-<br>
standing and structurally sound to withstand handling when inserted between the<br>
membranes in the fabrication of a cell. Typically, the spacer layers are fabricated<br>
from polymer, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, and can have a regular<br>
pattern. A typical thickness of the spacer layer is from about 0.25 to about 1 mm<br>
(10 to 40 mils). Spacer layers thinner than 0.25 mm are difficult to handle and can<br>
result in stretching of spacer strands, tearing or creasing, in the assembly of cells,<br>
and they are also generally more expensive and difficult to make. A further<br>
problem in attempting to reduce spacer thickness arises because the pressure of<br>
the solution passed through the cell needs to be increased to deliver the same<br>
solution flow rate. Thus, generally, relatively thick spacer layers are used in the<br>
electrochemical cell, further increasing the bulk volume of the cell and reducing<br>
solution treatment output per unit volume of cell space.<br>
The stack of membranes and spacers is also difficult to assemble into or remove<br>
from the cell for cleaning or replacement. Typically, a number of membranes and<br><br><br>
spacers are used in a cell, and it is desirable to be able to more easily handle the<br>
stack of membranes. The membrane stack can also become easily disoriented in<br>
the cell during assembly of the cell or during use. Also, when membranes are<br>
sealed into 10 water-tight electrochemical cells, it is difficult to open the cells to<br>
remove the membranes without damaging the cell or membranes. A cell structure<br>
that can be easily assembled or opened is desirable.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to have an electrochemical ion exchange cell capable of<br>
providing good ion exchange rates. It is also desirable to have a water-splitting<br>
membrane and spacer that exhibits sufficient strength for handling and use and<br>
which is not excessively thick. It is further desirable to limit the number of steps<br>
needed to manufacture such cells, reduce the number of parts for assembly, and<br>
reduce assembly errors. It is also desirable to have a cell that can be easily<br>
assembled or disassembled without damaging or disorienting the membranes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
An electrochemical cell comprises an Ion exchange membrane 10 (also known as<br>
a bipolar, double, or laminar membrane), an exemplary embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 1A. The Ion exchange membrane comprises anion and cation<br>
exchange materials which can be in the form of solids or gels, and contain Ions<br>
which are replaceable by other Ions or Ions which chemically react with specific<br>
ions to remove the ions from a solution stream. For example, suitable cation and<br>
anion exchange materials can include crosslinked or un- crosslinked organic<br>
polymers or Inorganic structures such as zeolites. Anion exchange materials<br>
exchange anions with no permanent change to their structure, and can be for<br>
example, basic groups. Other suitable anion exchange materials can include<br>
basic functional groups capable of exchanging anions such as -NR3A -NR2HA,<br>
-PR3A, -SR2A, or C5H5NHA (pyridine), where R is an alkyl, aryl, or other organic<br>
group and A Is an anion (e.g., hydroxide, bicarbonate, chloride, or sulfate Ion).<br>
Cation exchange materials exchange cations with no permanent change to the<br>
structure of the material, and can include, for example, acidic groups. Suitable<br>
cation exchange materials can include acidic functional groups capable of<br>
exchanging cations such as -COOM, -SO3M, -PO3M2, and -C6H4OM, where M is a<br>
cation (e.g., hydrogen, sodium, calcium, or copper Ion). Cation exchange<br>
materials also include those comprising neutral groups or ligands that bind<br>
cations through coordinate rather than electrostatic or Ionic bonds (for example<br>
pyridine, phosphine and sulfide groups), and groups comprising complexing or<br>
chelating groups (e.g., those derived from aminophosphoric acid, aminocarboxylic<br>
acid and hydroxamic acid.<br><br><br>
The selection of suitable cation and anion exchange materials for the Ion<br>
exchange membrane 10 depends on the application of the membrane. In one<br>
version, the membrane 10 comprises an anion exchange layer 12 abutting a<br>
cation exchange layer 14 to form a heterogeneous water-splitting Interface 18.<br>
The anion exchange layer 12 contains anion exchange material and the cation<br>
exchange layer 14 contains cation exchange materials. For example, in. the<br>
delonizatlon of a water based solution stream, the membrane 10 can have an<br>
anion exchange layer 12 having - NR3A groups such as triethyl ammoniums<br>
(-N(C2H5)3 groups, and an cation exchange layer 14 comprising -SO3M or<br>
carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups. Such a membrane 10 swells in water to. have a<br>
lower electrical resistance and higher mass transport rate over a wide range of<br>
pH. Anion exchange materials comprising weak base or weak acid groups are<br>
preferred when particularly efficient ion exchange regeneration is required. For<br>
example. -NR2HA will react with OH" in a very favorable reaction to form -NR2 ,<br>
H2O and expel A" As another example, for the selective removal of calcium or<br>
copper ions from a liquid containing other ions, for example sodium ion. Ion<br>
exchange groups such as -COOM or a chelating group such as aminocarboxylic<br>
acid are preferred. These weak acid groups offer the additional benefit of<br>
particularly efficient regeneration due to the strongly favorable reaction of<br>
-(COO)nM with H+ to form -COOH and expel M+n where M is a metal ion.<br>
Preferably, the membrane 10 is textured to have at least one exposed surface 24<br>
with texture features 26 comprising a pattern of repeating three-dimensional<br>
shapes, such as an array peaks 28 and valleys 30, exemplary embodiments of<br>
which are shown in FIGS. 1 A to 1 E. 2 and 3. The texture features 26 generally<br><br><br>
have dimensions that on the order of microns or greater as explained below and<br>
are not sized in sub-micron ranges. In one version, the texture features 26 can<br>
have peaks 28 shaped like ridges 36a.b which are spaced apart and parallel to a<br>
flow path of the solution stream 20 and valleys 30 comprising furrows 38a.b that<br>
lie between adjacent 20 ridges 36 as shown in FIG. 1 A.<br>
The ridges 36a.b and furrows 38a.b can be on both surfaces 24a.b or layers<br>
12,14 of the membrane 10. For example, In the version shown in FIG. 1 B. the<br>
ridges 36a.b and furrows 38a.b are positioned on both sides of the membrane 10<br>
such 25 that a ridge 36a on one side (or layer) of the membrane 10 lies generally<br>
opposite a furrow 38a on the other side (or layer) of the membrane 10. This<br>
arrangement is better for providing more uniform current density and hence better<br>
utilization of Ion exchange capacity.<br>
In yet another version, as shown in FIG. 1 C, the entire membrane 10 undulates<br>
with a furrow 38a on the first surface 24a following the contour of a ridge 36b on<br>
the second surface 24b of the membrane 10. and a ridge 36a on the first surface<br>
24a similarly following the contour of the furrow 38b on the second surface 24b of<br>
the membrane 10. In this version, the corrugated membrane 10 has a corrugation<br>
obtained from rows of ridges 28 running in the direction of the solution stream 20<br>
on both opposing sides of the membrane 10, i.e., the peaks 28a on one side of<br>
the membrane 10 lie opposite the valleys 30b on the other side of the membrane<br>
10. The corrugated membrane 10 provides a uniform distance across anion and<br>
cation exchange Iayers5 12,14, respectively, in contrast to other membrane<br>
designs that can provide thin and thick anion and/or cation layers as illustrated in<br><br><br>
1 B. This provides still more uniform current densities and Ion exchange capacity<br>
utilization. Other arrangements of the ridges 36a,b and furrows 38a,b can also be<br>
used, for example, with the ridges 36a and furrows 38a on one surface 24a<br>
asymmetrical to the ridges 36b and furrows 38b on the 10 other surface 24b, such<br>
that they are generally non-parallel or even perpendicular to one another (not<br>
shown).<br>
It may also be useful to texture only one side of a water-splitting membrane .10,<br>
for example the surface 24 as shown in FIG.1D, to increase the extraction of-<br>
either cations or anions. In this version, the surface 24a formed from the anion<br>
layer 12 has the ridges 36 and furrows 38, while the other surface 24b is flat. This<br>
membrane 10 also has parallel ridges 36 with channels 40 cutting across the<br>
ridges 36. The channels 40 are oriented along a different direction than the<br>
orientation of the ridges 36 (or furrows 38) to promote turbulence and/or increase<br>
surface area. For example, the channels 40 can be oriented generally<br>
perpendicular to the orientation of the ridges 36 and furrows 38 so that they<br>
define additional passages that traverse the direction of flow of the solution<br>
stream 20 across the membrane 10. The channels 40 can also be oriented at any<br>
angular direction relative to that of the rides 36 or furrows 38.<br>
The peaks 28 and valleys 30 of the texture features 26 can also be other<br>
structures other than ridges 36 and furrows 38. For example, the peaks 28 can<br>
comprise conical protrusions 48 that extend out from an otherwise substantially<br>
flat surface region 49 which defines the valleys 30 between the peaks 28, as<br>
shown in FIG. 2. In this version, the conical protrusions 48 are randomly spaced<br><br><br>
apart and distributed across the membrane surface. The conical protrusions 48<br>
create a turbulent convoluted flow of the solution stream 20 across the exposed<br>
surface 24 of the membrane 110, which increases the residence time of the<br>
solution stream 20 on the membrane 10. The conical protrusions 48 may be<br>
formed by abrasion, foaming, embossing, or any other suitable means. Instead of<br>
a conical shape, the conical protrusions 48 can also have other shapes and<br>
dimensions.<br>
In yet another version, the membrane 10 comprises texture features 26<br>
comprising peaks 28 shaped like mesas 50 that extend out of an otherwise<br>
substantially flat surface region 49 which defines the valleys 30 between the<br>
peaks 28, as shown in FIG. 3. The mesas 50 have a flat cut-off top and are<br>
generally cylindrical with a rounded bottom edge. The mesas 50 can be formed,<br>
for example, impressing a mesh screen having a pattern of round holes into a<br>
freshly formed membrane sheet by a press, such as a hydraulic press, or by<br>
running a membrane sheet through rollers having a pattern of holes therein. This,<br>
version is particularly useful when the solution stream has a large amount of<br>
dissolved solids that would otherwise get entrapped into the fine holes and<br>
spaces between other types of texture features 26.<br>
It is believed that the texture features 26 on the exposed surface 24 of the<br>
membrane 10 can increase mass transport of Ions between membrane 10 and<br>
solution stream 20, and can also serve to separate the membranes from one<br>
another while still allowing solution to flow between membranes through texture<br>
valleys. In explaining the effects of texture on the exposed surface 24 of the<br><br><br>
membrane 10, it is beneficial to distinguish between geometric area, surface area,<br>
and surface roughness. Geometric area is the area measured with a ruler when a<br>
membrane 10 is laid out flat on a planar surface. Surface area is measured on a<br>
scale that Increases mass transport of species, e.g. Ions, from solution to the<br>
membrane surface. The texture features 26 are provided to increase the surface<br>
area for a given geometric area. The size of the texture features 26 which must<br>
be considered in measuring surface area is determined by the solution stagnant<br>
layer thickness, which is typically greater than one micron as described below<br>
Surface roughness refers to micro-texture features 42, as described below, whichrs<br>
are generally sub-micron sized features that are smaller than the solutions<br>
stagnant layer thickness, and hence do not substantially influence mass transport<br>
rates from solution to the membrane 10.	<br>
Thus, as certain dimensions of the texture features 26 increases, the surface area of the exposed surface 24 of the membrane 10 also proportionately<br>
increases. If the dimensions of the textured features 26 are greater than the<br>
stagnant layer thickness, mass transport rates into and out of the membrane 10<br>
will increase. The mass transport from a solution to 'a membrane 10 or other<br>
surface Is proportional to the surface area of the stagnant layer. At the boundary<br>
between a surface and a stirred or flowing solution there is a layer of solution, the<br>
stagnant layer, which Is flowing or stirring at a significantly slower rate than the<br>
bulk solution stream. The rate of flow is described in terms of solution velocity that<br>
decreases as one nears the stagnant layer from within the bulk solution, and this<br>
velocity is zero at the surface. Because the solution velocity Is a smooth<br>
continuous function from the edge of the bulk solution to the Immobile surface,<br><br><br>
the stagnant layer thickness can be mathematically defined as the distance from<br>
the surface at which the solution speed increases to 99% of the bulk or free<br>
stream solution speed:<br>
Stagnant Layer Thickness δ = 5/√Rex	(2) where Re is the<br>
Reynolds number of the solution in the channel, and viscous flow dominates<br>
when Re is small (≤2000) and turbulent flow dominates when Re is large (≥2000).<br>
When the dimensions of the texture features 26 are larger than the stagnant<br>
layer thickness 8, the stagnant layer begins to follow the contour of the<br>
features 26 on the exposed surface 24 of the membrane 10, and thus, the surface<br>
area of the stagnant layer increases with increasing membrane surface area.<br>
When the texture features 26 have dimensions smaller than the stagnant layer<br>
thickness 8, the stagnant layer is essentially flat on the surface 24 of the<br>
membrane 10 to have a reduced surface area. Thus, for a given geometric area,<br>
faster mass transport into and out of the cation and anion exchange layers 12, 14<br>
of the membrane 10 results from increasing the effective area of the stagnant<br>
layer by the use of features that have dimensions greater than the stagnant layer<br>
thickness 8. The textured membranelO then has an effective surface area for<br>
mass transport that includes the larger area resulting from the convoluted<br>
topography of the textured features 26. For the typical solution velocities of a<br>
solution stream passing across the surface 24 of a membrane 10, the stagnant<br>
layer thickness 8 is usually about 1 micron or larger, with the layer thickness 8<br>
increasing as the flow rate of the solution stream decreases. Thus, a suitable<br>
dimension of the texture features 26 of the membrane 10 should be at least about<br>
1 micron, and more typically at least about 10 microns.<br><br><br>
As illustrated by the exemplary embodiments described above, the texture<br>
features 26 have different shapes depending on their application, that can include<br><br>
for example, peaks 28 that are shaped as ridges 36, conical protrusions 48, or<br>
mesas 50; and valleys 30 formed by furrows 38, grooves 46 or flat surface<br>
regions 49. The dimensions of these peaks 28 and valleys 30 can be<br>
appropriately described by, for example, peak heights or valley depths, the<br>
distance dpv (peak to valley) which would be the distance from the crown 44 of a<br>
peak 28 to the base 52 of a valley 30, or dpp (peak to peak) which would be the<br>
distance from one peak 28a to an adjacent peak 28b. Referring to FIG. 2, the<br>
crowns 44 of the peaks 28 are those portions of the peaks that are furthest from<br>
the water splitting interface 18 between the two ion exchange layers 12, 14 of the<br>
membrane 10, and the base 52 of the valleys 30 are those portions of the valleys<br>
that are closest to the interface 18. The absolute dimensions selected depends on<br>
the application, since thinner membranes 10 with texture features 26 having<br>
smaller dimensions provide greater surface area in a given 15 volume of a cell,<br>
but may exhibit excessive pressure drops due to the small channels available for<br>
flow of the solution stream between the features 26. In one version, the texture<br>
features 26 comprise a distance dpv of at least about 10 microns or more<br>
preferably at least about 100 microns; and the distance dpp can be at least about<br>
10 microns or more preferably at least about 100 microns.<br>
The texture features 26 of the membranes 10 can also be defined by an aspect<br>
ratio that depends on the balance of properties desired for an electrochemical<br>
cell. Thus:<br><br><br>
Texture Feature Aspect Ratio=	6pv I dpp	 (1) in Equation<br>
1, dpv (distance peak to valley) refers to the average distance from a crown 44x of<br>
a peak 28x to a base 52x of an adjacent valley 30x; and dpp (distance peak to<br>
peak) refers to average distances between the crowns 44x,y of the adjacent<br>
peaks 44x,y. For any given type of texture feature 26, such as the ridges, furrows,<br>
grooves, channels, or protrusions, the aspect ratios can be estimated from<br>
average values for dpv and dpp. The surface area of the membrane increases as<br>
the texture feature aspect ratio increases. A suitable ratio of dpv/dpp is at least<br>
about 0.10, more preferably at least 0.5, and most preferably at least 1.0.<br>
Excessively high aspect ratios may provide a textured membrane 10 that folds or<br>
buckles during assembly of the cell or high solution pressures and are thus<br>
undesirable.<br>
A variety of methods may be used to fabricate the texture features 26 on the<br>
water-splitting membrane 10. The selected fabrication method can depend upon<br>
the shape, dimensions, and spacing of the texture features 26. For example,<br>
texture features 26 comprising peaks 28 that are shaped as parallel and spaced<br>
apart ridges 36 and valleys 30 shaped as furrows 38 between the ridges 36, as<br>
shown in FIG. 1A, can be formed by passing an un-textured smooth membrane<br>
sheet 60 that is mounted as a roll 62 on a roller 64, through a pair of rollers 68a,b,<br>
where at least one roller 68a has a Imprinted roller surface 70 that is imprinted<br>
with the a desired pattern of circumferential raised portions 72a and<br>
circumferential troughs 72b that correspond to the ridges 36 and furrows 38, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5. When the smooth membrane sheet 60 passes through the pair<br><br><br>
of roller 68a,b, the imprinted pattern on the roller surface 70 is embossed on the<br>
surface of the smooth membrane sheet 60 that is in contact with the imprinted<br>
roller surface 70 to form a textured membrane 10 having a corresponding pattern<br>
of ridges 36 and furrows 38. Other methods of forming the membrane 10<br>
including, for example, forming a pattern of mesas 50, as shown in FIG. 3, by<br>
thermoforming by compression the desired texture pattern on a smooth<br>
membrane sheet 60 between plates or rollers. The pattern of conical protrusions<br>
48 can be formed by sandblasting the membrane sheet 60, abrading the<br>
membrane sheet 60 with a stiff brush, or introducing open pores into the. material<br>
of the membrane sheet 60 using foaming agents. Other methods capable of<br>
forming the texture features 26 on the membrane 10 having peak-valley and<br>
peak-peak dimensions greater than the stagnant layer thickness, for example,<br>
about 1 micron, are also suitable.<br>
In another version, micro-texture features 42 are superimposed on top of the<br>
macro texture features 26, for example, fine grooves 74 that are abraded or<br>
scratched onto the peaks 28, as shown in FIG. 1 D. In the version shown, the fine<br>
grooves 74 are formed as a secondary pressed pattern onto the entire surface of<br>
the peaks 28. When the micro-texture dimensions are greater than the stagnant<br>
layer thickness, this increases mass transport rates. Micro-texture features 42<br>
comprising fine grooves 74 that are abrasion marks can be formed on the<br>
membrane 10 by, for example, sand blasting the membrane 10. The sand<br>
blasting can be performed with a sequence of nozzles 75 mounted on a tube 76<br>
that each direct abrasive particle jets 78 onto the membrane 10, as shown in FIG.<br>
5. The abrasive particle jets 78 can be forced out by pressured air or other gases.<br><br><br>
Suitable abrasive particles include aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, or silicon<br>
carbide. Pores or other fine texture features can be formed on the surface of the<br>
membrane 10 that is already coarsely textured with peaks 28 and valleys 30, for<br>
example, by adding a pore forming material to the membrane during fabrication of<br>
the membrane 10. The pore forming material can be dissolved out of the<br>
membrane 10 during fabrication of the membrane 10 to form the pores on the<br>
membrane surface.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, an integral spacer 80 provides spacing<br>
between adjacent membranes 10 to allow the solution stream 20 to flow across<br>
substantially all the exposed surfaces 24 of the membrane 10. The integral<br>
spacer 80 is bonded to the textured membrane 10 to form a unitary article such<br>
that the membrane 10 and integral spacer 80 form a single structure.<br>
Advantageously, by being bonded to the membrane 10, the integral spacer 80 is<br>
not displaced from its position on the membrane during the process of<br>
transporting the membrane 10 as rolls or sheets, or during the fabrication of<br>
cartridges or electrochemical cells using the water splitting membrane 10. The<br>
integral spacer 80 can be adhered to either one or both of the exposed surfaces<br>
24a,b of the membrane 10. This integral spacer 80 should be formed of a non-<br>
conducting material, such as a dielectric material, that maintains its	shape<br>
in the solution to be treated. The thickness of the integral spacer 80 can vary over<br>
a wide range that depends upon the particular ion removal application. For<br>
example, a thicker spacer 80 can provide a stiffer membrane 10 which may not<br>
be useful for preparing a spiral wrapped cell design but which exhibits particularly<br>
low pressure drop even at high flow rates. A thinner spacer 80 allows more<br><br><br>
concentric layers of water-splitting membrane 10 to be wrappeckin a given<br>
volume, thereby providing greater specific volume capacities. The spacer 80 has<br>
a thickness which is sufficiently high to substantially prevent physical contact<br>
between adjacent membranes, which is typically at least about 10 'microns. The<br>
maximum spacer thickness, for practical reasons, is less than about 1000<br>
microns. Spacer thickness greater than 1000 microns reduce specific volume<br>
capacity with little benefit to reducing pressure drops in most applications. It is<br>
also important to avoid blocking the valleys 30 defined by the texture features 26 to allow the solution stream 20 to flow substantially unrestricted across the<br>
exposed surface 24 of membrane 10 and between, the peaks 28.<br>
The integral spacer 80, may be applied to the water splitting membrane 10 by any<br>
method that provides spacing of adjacent membranes 10. Suitable methods for<br>
applying the integral spacer 80 to the membrane 10 include spraying continuous<br>
polymer filament onto the texture surface 24 of the membrane 10, using a sprayer .<br>
nozzle 86 that is connected via a feed tube 88 to a polymer tank 85. The molten,<br>
filament polymer is forced through a feed tube 88 by pressurized hot air from a<br>
tank 90 controlled by a feed valve 92. Upon cooling the hot sprayed filaments<br>
form an integral spacer which is a randomly Interspersed net of filaments. The<br>
polymer tank 85 can contain an un-cured liquid polymer precursor or a molten<br>
thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. Air temperature, air flow rate, distance from<br>
the membrane surface, and polymer softening temperature are selected to form a<br>
desired thickness of the integral spacer 80 while avoiding sagging of the hot<br>
polymer/fiber layer into the valleys 30 or other depressions of the textured<br>
features 26 formed on the exposed surface 24 of the membrane 10 - while<br><br><br>
providing good adhesion of the integral spacer 80 to the membrane 10. In another<br>
method, filaments 82 coated with a solution through which the textured<br>
membrane 10 is passed, can be applied onto the membrane 10 to form the<br>
integral spacer 80. In yet another method, gravure coating of the crowns 44 of the<br>
peaks 28 of the texture features 42, can also be used to form the integral spacer<br>
80. The integral spacer 80 can also be fabricated by methods such as for<br>
example, those used for the preparation of non-woven fabrics. While the textured<br>
membranes 10 may have only one textured surface, to obtain uniform flow of the<br>
solution stream across both membrane surfaces 24 a.b. It can be preferred to<br>
employ textured membranes 10 that have surface texturing on both surfaces for<br>
use of the integral spacer 80; otherwise, a spacer 80 laying flat against a<br>
membrane surface can block the flow of a solution stream or cause the solution to<br>
preferentially flow past a textured surface 24a and potentially preventing it from<br>
efficiently flowing across opposing or adjacent flat surface 24b of a membrane 10.<br>
The integral spacer 80 between the membranes 10 provides a significant<br>
reduction in volume of an electrochemical cell 102. Conventional spacer layers,<br>
while they can still be used, have to be sufficiently thick to be free-standing and<br>
structurally sound to withstand handling when inserted between the textured<br>
membranes 10 in the fabrication of a cell 102. Typically conventional spacer<br>
layers are fabricated from polymer such as polyethylene or polypropylene, and<br>
have a thickness of from about 0.25 to about 1mm. Spacer layers thinner than<br>
0.25mm are difficult to handle and can result stretching of spacer strands, tearing<br>
or creasing, iri the assembly of cells, and they are also generally more difficult to<br>
make. A further problem in attempting to reduce spacer thickness arises because<br><br><br>
the pressure of the solution flow rate. Thus, conventionally, relatively thik spacer<br>
layers are used in a cell 102, which increases the bulk volume of the cell and<br>
reduces solution treatment output per unit volume of cell space. However,<br><br>
conventional spacer layers can still be used with the textured membranes 10 to<br>
provide effective electrochemical cells 102, especially when space and cell<br>
volume is not of primary concern, or for example, when the space between the<br>
membranes 10 needs to be large than that provided by the integral spacers 80.<br>
The textured membranes 10 and optional integral spacers 80, or separate spacer<br>
layers, are assembled into a cartridge 100 that facilitates installation and removal<br>
of the membranes 10 from an electrochemical cell 102, embodiments of which<br>
are shown in FIGS 6 &amp; 7. The cartridge 100 can be easily removed from the cell<br>
102, which may be necessary when the space between the adjacent pairs of<br>
membranes 10 and their integral spacers 80 become clogged, for example with<br>
calcium carbonate scale of other solid materials. The cartridge 100 also facilitates<br>
shipment of replacement membranes 10 to the distributor or end user. In addition,<br>
the cartridge 100 also allows a particular membrane configuration that promotes<br>
efficient ion exchange to be fabricated.<br>
In one embodiment, the cartridge 100 comprises several membranes 10 with<br>
integral spacers 80 that are spirally wound around a core tube 106, which is<br>
typically cylindrical, as shown in FIG.6. The spirally wound membranes 10 can be<br>
enclosed by an outer sleeve 110, and sealed at both ends with two end caps<br>
114a, b. When the membrane 10 does not have an integral spacer 80, the<br>
cartridge 100 is fabricated with a spacer sleeve (not shown) between each<br><br><br>
membrane 10, as for example, described in commonly assigned U.S Patent<br>
Application No. 10/637,186 filed on August 8th, 2003 entitled "Selectable Ion<br>
concentration with Electrolytic Ion Exchange", which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The surfaces of the outer sleeve 110, core tube 106 and<br>
end caps 114a, b direct the solution stream 20 through a solution passageway<br>
115 that passes across the exposed surfaces 24 of the textured membrane 10 In<br>
traveling from the Inlet 116 to the outlet 118 of the cell 1 02. The cartridge 100<br>
may be designed for a variety of flow patterns, for example end-to end flow<br>
(parallel to the cored tube 106) or Inner-to-outer flow (radial flow to or from the<br>
core tube 106).	<br>
Each end cap 114a,b of the cartridge 100 can be a flat plate mounted on either<br>
end of the core tube '106. The core tube 106, outer sleeve 110 and end-caps<br>
114a,b are designed to provide a solution passageway 115 that provides the<br>
desired flow pattern across substantially the entire membrane surface. For<br>
example, for the solution stream 20 to flow radially to or from the core tube 106,<br>
across both the inner and outer surfaces of each textured membrane 10, the end-<br>
caps 114a,b seal the ends of the spirally wound membrane to prevent solution<br>
from by-passing the membrane surface on its way from inlet to outlet. The<br>
textured membranes 10 can also be arranged in the cartridge 100 to provide a<br>
solution passageway 115 that forms a unitary and contiguous solution channel<br>
that flows past both the anion and cation exchange layers 12, 14 of each<br>
membrane 10. Preferably, the unitary channel is connected throughout in an<br>
unbroken sequence extending continuously from the inlet 116 to the outlet 118,<br>
and flowing past each anion and cation exchange layers 12, 14:, respectively, of<br><br><br>
the water-splitting membranes 10. Thus the unitary and contiguous channels<br>
perimeter comprises at least a portion of all the cation and anion exchange layers<br>
12,14, of the membranes 10 within the cartridge 100.	<br>
	The membranes 10 can be spiral wrapped with the integral spacers 80 formed on<br>
the inner surface of a cation exchange layer 14 separating It from the 2S adjacent<br>
anion exchange layer 12, and providing the solution passageway 115 there<br>
between. In this one embodiment, three membranes 10 are spiral wrapped to<br>
form a parallel flow arrangement, which means that the solution can flow from<br>
inlet to outlet in three equivalent passageways between membrane layers. For<br>
any flow pattern, for example parallel or radial relative to the core tube 106, one<br>
or more 30 membranes 10 can be wrapped in a parallel arrangement to vary the<br>
pressure drop across the cartridge 100, the number of membranes 10 that are<br>
being wrapped in a parallel flow arrangement selected to provide the desired<br>
pressure drop through the cell 102. While the membranes 10 are generally tightly<br>
wound against each other, for pictorial clarity, the membranes are shown loosely<br>
wound with spaces between them. In this version, the wrapped cartridge 100 is<br>
absent electrodes, which are positioned outside the cartridge in the cell.<br>
One cartridge fabrication method, as illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 7, reduces<br>
the time and labor required to fabricate a cartridge 100 having spiral wound<br>
membranes 10. In this method, the cartridge 100 is fabricated from a plurality of<br>
membranes 10, for example, from about 2 to about 100 membranes. In one<br>
version, six textured membranes 10a-f are wrapped in a parallel flow<br>
arrangement. The parallel flow arrangement allows the influent solution stream 20<br><br><br>
which is passed into the cartridge 100 to flow simultaneously through anumber of<br>
parallel flow paths, each of which lies between parallel membranes 10. The<br>
membranes 10a-f are laid up one on top of the other, on a flat table surface, with<br>
the top ends 113a-f of the membranes 10 offset from one another, as shown in<br>
FIG. 8A. In one version, the top ends 113a-f of the membranes 10a-f are offset by<br>
a distance do = 3.14*dc/n, where dc is the outer diameter of the core tube 106 on<br>
which the membranes 10a-f are wrapped. Offsetting membranes:ensures that the<br>
top ends 113a-f of the membranes 10a-f contact the core tube;:106 to provide<br>
inlets or entrances in the gaps between the membranes 10a-f for fluid to enter<br>
between and flow through all membranes. If membranes 10a-f are not offset, the<br>
flow of fluid may be constricted to some of the membranes 10a-f, thereby<br>
reducing cartridge performance. It Is not necessary to evenly- space all the<br>
membranes 10a-f apart by the distance do, but the top ends 113a-f should be<br>
offset in the same direction, and should be arranged so that all the membranes<br>
fall within the circumference of the core tube 106. Evenly spacing apart the top<br>
ends 113a-f of the membranes 1 Oa-f while forming the assembly provides more<br>
uniform, flow into and out 25 of the cartridge to provide more thorough<br>
replacement of solution in the inner and outer cell volume.<br>
The assembled of membranes 10a-f are then attached to one other to form an<br>
assembled offset membrane stack 119. The membranes 10a-f can be 30<br>
attached by, for example, clips, glue, heat staking, rivets, sewing, staples,<br>
ultrasonic bonding or welding. In a preferred method of attachment, the stack 119<br>
of membranes 10a-f is attached to the core tube 106 by glue, such as Macromelt<br>
Q5353 or Technomelt Q5305, both from Henkel. For drinking water applications,<br><br><br>
glue should meet extraction requirements of FDA 21 CFR 175.105. In a preferred<br>
version, the glue is dispensed from a multi-head applicator to apply narrow lines<br>
or zigzag lines of glue crossing the top ends 113a-f of all the n membranes 10a-f<br>
to bond only the ends of the membranes, as shown in FIG. 8B. This gluing<br>
method assures the membranes 10a-f can slide across one another when<br>
subsequently wound around the core net tube to 5 avoid a lump when winding the<br>
assembled stack on a core tube 106.<br>
The top surface 123 of the first membrane 10a of the assembled stack 10a-f is<br>
then positioned on the core tube 106 so that the top ends 113a-f is closest to the<br>
tube. The stack 119 may be attached to the core tube 106 by applying a glue line<br>
on the edge of the top surface of the bottom membrane 10a of the stack 119. The<br>
stack 119 is then wound around the core tube 106 while applying a pressure to<br>
the membranes 110 to produce a wound cartridge 100. During winding, the stack<br>
119 can be maintained under tensile or compressive strain by applying a<br>
compressive force on the stack 119 as it is being wound around the core tube 106<br>
for example by squeezing the stack 119 with for example one or more rolls.<br>
Alternatively, the opposing bottom ends 117a-f of the membranes 10a-f can also<br>
be pulled out to maintain the membranes under tension while the stack 119 is<br>
being wound around the core tube 106.<br>
Sub-assemblies of membranes 10 which contain less than the total number n of<br>
membranes desired in the cartridge can also be used to reduce the number of<br>
objects required to assemble a cartridge 100. For example, two or more sub-<br>
assembly stacks of membranes can be stacked and the membranes attached to<br><br><br>
each other as described above, each sub-assembly comprising nix sheets (not<br>
shown), where n is the total number of desirable sheets, and x is the number of<br>
sub-assemblies. The x sub-assembly stacks may then separately attached to the<br>
core tube 106, or attached to each other prior to attachment to the core net tube.<br>
This procedure again allows the individual membranes 10 to slide across each<br>
other during winding rather than bunching up to form a lump adjacent to the<br>
surface of the core tube during the membrane winding process. Any bunched up,<br>
membrane lumps would interfere with the flow of fluid through the cell 102 and<br>
also increases the diameter of the finished cartridge 100. <br>
In another version, the top or bottom ends of the membranes 10 are attached to<br>
an outer sleeve 100 to provide a stronger assembly. The outer sleeve 110 can be<br>
a porous sheet, such as a spacer net made from a dielectric, or hydraulically<br>
permeable, material such as for example Ultraflow 3725 netting from. Daystar,<br>
Texas. The spacer net comprises a network of holes 133 which allow solution to<br>
permeate into the rolled stack of membranes. For example, the outer sleeve 110<br>
can have holes 5 having dimensions, such as a width and height or a diameter,<br>
sized from about 0.1 to about 10 mm. The attachment to the sleeve 110 provides<br>
a stronger assembly if using fragile or heavier membranes<br>
In one version, the outer sleeve 110 is attached to the bottom end 135 of one of<br>
the upper membranes 10d, as for example shown in FIG. 88, which is opposite to<br>
the top end 113d which is first wound on the core tube 106. The sleeve 110<br>
serves as a containment wrap to contain the membranes 10 which are wound on<br>
the core tube 106 to form the cartridge 100. The sleeve 110 is attached to<br><br><br>
membrane 10d with a line or spots of glue, or other means. The sleeve 110 has a<br>
length that is sufficiently long to wrap completely the wound', stacked membranes<br>
until it overlaps on itself forming a porous sheet tube around the spiral wound<br>
membranes. The sleeve 110 may then attached to itself with glue, a weld, a fiber,<br>
or other means to enclose the stack 119 to form an assembled cartridge roll 136<br>
as shown in FIG. 8C. After fabrication, the cartridge roll 136 is cut to the desired<br>
length to fit into a housing 129 of an 20 electrochemical cell 102. The top and<br>
bottom end caps 114a,b are then positioned on the ends of the cartridge roll 136<br>
and are also glued to the roll 136 to form the assembled cartridge 100. Each end<br>
cap 114a.b has a hole 133a.b to allow fluid to enter the core tube 106. <br>
The cartridge 100 is positioned within a housing 129 of the electrochemical cell<br>
102. The housing 128 is typically but not necessarily a cylinder made of a<br>
polymer, which is non-conductive, resistant to hydrolysis in water, acids and<br>
bases, having good structural properties. Suitable polymers for the housing<br>
include, for example, polyvinylchloride (PVC). CPVC, polypropylene, or NORYL<br>
TM. General Electric, New York. The housing can be fabricated by injection<br>
molding or other means. The housing 129 has through-holes that serve as a<br>
solution inlet 116 for introducing an influent solution stream 20 into the cell 1 02<br>
and a solution outlet 118 to provide an effluent solution stream. The housing 129<br>
typically comprises two or more sections, for example, a vessel 93 comprising a<br>
tubular sidewall 94 with a bottom wall 95 and a detachable lid 96 which fits onto<br>
the vessel sidewall 94. The cartridge 100 is slid into the housing 129 so that the<br>
core tube 106 of the cartridge 100 slides over through-hole in the housing 129 to<br>
form the solution outlet 118 in the housing 129. Typically, the solution outlet 118<br><br><br>
is positioned at the center of a bottom surface 145 of the housing so that the hole<br>
133b in the bottom end cap 114b can fluidly connect to the solution outlet 118.<br>
The solution outlet 118 can be a hole as shown or a short cylinder (not shown)<br>
that protrudes out to slide into the hole 133 of the core tube 106. O-ring seals and<br>
gaskets can be used to seal the hole 133. Advantageously, the cartridge 100 can<br>
be easily removed for cleaning or replaced from the housing 129. A top plate. 147<br>
is then used to cover up the other end of the housing 129.	<br>
Additional layers such as the outer electrode.124, electrode support, etc as<br>
shown in FIG. 6, are also placed between the cartridge 100 and the housing 129.<br>
For example, the outer electrode 124 and central electrode 128 are in the housing<br>
129 such that the cation exchange layers 14 of the membranes 10 face the first<br>
electrode 124, and the anion exchange layers 12 of the membranes 10 face the<br>
second electrode128. The electrodes 124, 128 are fabricated from electrically<br>
conductive materials, such as metals, which are preferably resistant to corrosion<br>
in the low or high pH chemical environments created during positive and negative<br>
polarization of the electrodes during operation of the cell 1 02. Suitable electrodes<br>
124, 128 can be fabricated from corrosion-resistant materials such as titanium or<br>
niobium, and can have an outer coating of a noble metal, such as platinum. The<br>
shape of the electrodes 124,128 depends upon the design of the electrochemical<br>
cell 1 02 and the conductivity of the solution stream 20 flowing through the cell<br>
102. Suitable electrodes 124, 128 comprise a wire arranged to provide a uniform<br>
voltage across the cartridge. However, the electrodes 124, 128 can also have<br>
other shapes, such as cylindrical, plate, spiral, disc, or even conical shapes. In<br>
this version, the core tube 106 also serves as the Inner electrode 124.<br><br><br>
In one version, as shown in FIGS 9A and 98, the housing comprises a<br>
detachable lid 96 that slides over and holds the cartridge 100 during assembly of<br>
the cell 102. The detachable lid 96 comprises a plate 97 with a side surface 98<br>
having an external male thread 99 for screwing into a receiving female thread 136<br>
in the housing 129 of the cell 1 02, and a handle 137 which assists an operator in<br>
screwing in and out detachable lid 96 which fits onto the vessel sidewall 94. The<br>
cartridge 100 is slid into the housing 129 so that the core tube 106 of the cartridge<br>
100 slides over through-hole in the housing 129 to form the solution outlet 118 in<br>
the housing 129. Typically, the solution outlet 118: is positioned at the center of a<br>
bottom surface 145 of the housing so that the hole 133b in the bottom end capr<br>
114b can fluidly connect to the solution outlet 118:.The solution outlet 118 can be<br>
a hole as shown or a short cylinder (not shown) that protrudes out to slide into the<br>
hole 133 of the core tube 106. O-ring seals and gaskets can be used to seal the<br>
hole 133. Advantageously, the cartridge 100 can. be easily removed for cleaning.<br>
or replaced from the housing 129. A top plate. 147 is then used to cover up the<br>
other end of the housing 129. Additional layers such as the outer electrode 124,-.:<br>
electrode support, etc., as shown In FIG. 6, are also placed between the cartridge<br>
100 and the housing 129. For example, the outer electrode 124 and central<br>
electrode 128 are in the housing 129 15 such that the caption exchange layers 14<br>
of the membranes 10 face the first electrode 124, and the anion exchange layers<br>
12 of the membranes 10 face the second electrode128. The electrodes 124, 128<br>
are fabricated from electrically conductive materials, such as metals, which are<br>
preferably resistant to con-oslon in the low or high pH chemical environments<br>
created during positive and negative polarization of the electrodes during<br>
operation of the cell 1 02. Suitable .electrodes 124, 128 can be fabricated from<br>
. 29<br><br>
corrosion-resistant materials such as titanium or niobium, and can have an outer<br>
coating of a noble metal, such as platinum. The shape of the electrodes 124, 128.<br>
depends upon the design of the electrochemical cell 1 02 andithe conductivity of<br>
the solution stream 20 flowing through the cell 1 02. Suitable electrodes 124, 128.;<br>
comprise a wire arranged to provide a uniform voltage across the cartridge.<br>
However, the electrodes 124, 128 can also have other shapes, such as:.<br>
cylindrical, plate, spiral, disc, or even conical shapes. In this version, the core<br>
tube 106 also serves as the inner electrode 124. In one version, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 9A and 98, the housing comprises a detachable lid 96 that slides over and<br>
holds the cartridge 100 during assembly of the cell 1 02. The detachable lid 96<br>
comprises a plate 97 with a side surface 98 having an external male thread 99 for<br>
screwing into a receiving female thread 136 in the housing 129 of the cell 1 02<br>
and a handled 37 which assists an operator in screwing in and out the lid 96. The detachable lid 96 further comprises a keyhole 140 that extends thorough the plate<br>
97 to receive an end-cap extension 143 (which is a protruding portion of the top<br>
end-cap 114a) which extends out of the top of the lid 96. The top cartridge cap comprises an o-ring on. its periphery, which forms the seal to the housing when fully inserted. The lid 96 holds the cartridge in position when under pressure. The.<br>
end-cap extension 143 further comprises a flange 148, which extends outward<br>
from the distal end of the extension. The keyhole 140 comprises a first hole 146<br>
having a dimension larger than the flange 148 of the end-cap extension 143 so<br>
that the extension 143 with Its flange 148 can slide through the hole 146. When<br>
the end-cap extension 143 is circular, the first hole 146 has a diameter larger than<br>
the diameter of the end-cap extension 143, for example, by about 5% or more.<br>
The first hole 146 opens to a second hole 149, which can be shaped as<br><br><br>
elongated aperture ending in a semicircular ontour which has a dimension sized<br>
smaller than the dimension of the flange 148 to snugly fit about the circular<br>
perimeter of the extension 143. To assemble 1 S the cell 102, an operator inserts<br>
slides the first larger hole 146 of the keyhole 140 of the detachable lid 96 over the<br>
flange 148 of the end-cap extension 143, as shown in FIG. 9A. Then the lid 96 is<br>
slid forward so that the end-cap extension 143 passes into the smaller second<br>
hole 149 of the keyhole, as shown in FIG. 9B. Now, the lid 96 can be screwed:<br>
onto the sidewall 94 of the vessel 93 with the cartridge 100 firmly attached to 20<br>
the lid 96 because the flange 148 holds the cartridge 100. to. the lid 94. A;<br>
completed version of the lid 96 with attached cartridge 100 which is screwed onto<br>
a vessel is shown in FIG. 9C.<br>
In still another version, as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the detachable 2S lid 96<br>
also comprises a plate 97 with a side surface 98 having at least a pair of<br>
outwardly projecting pins 152 that slide into a recessed groove 154 in the<br>
sidewall 94 of the vessel 93 to lock into place. However, in this version, a short<br>
hollow post 156 extends out of the plate 97. In one version, the hollow post 156<br>
extends downwardly from the bottom surface 91 of the plate 97 and is sized to<br>
slide over the end cap 30 extension 143 in the direction of the arrow, as shown in<br>
FIG. 10A; and in this version, the post 156 has an Inner diameter sized to snugly<br>
fit over the outer diameter of the extension 143, the inner diameter of the post<br>
156 being sized about 2% or so larger than the outer diameter of the extension<br>
143. In another version, the hollow post 156 extends upwardly from the top of the<br>
plate 97, as shown in FIG. 10C. In yet another version, the hollow post 156 is<br>
sized to slide into the end-cap extension 143, as shown in FIG. 10E, and in this<br><br><br>
version, the hollow post 156 has a dimension such as an outer diameterxthat is<br>
smaller than thejnner diameter of the end-cap extension 143 to fit snugly into the<br>
extension. The snug fit is used to hold the cartridge 100 to the lid 96 while the lid<br>
\	'	\ ■<br>
96 is locked into place in the sidewall 94 of the vessel 93 and rotated to engage<br>
the pins 152 into the recessed groove 154 to form a tight seal. The groove 154 .<br>
can also have a sloped portion 101 with a step-down locking channel 1 05, as<br>
shown in FIG. 10D, so that the lid 96 can be pushed down and rotated into the ;<br>
step-down locking channel 1 05 to lock the lid 96 into the vessel 93. Also, a:<br>
recessed first groove 158 can be positioned about the. base of the hollow, post..<br>
156 to hold an O-ring seal 160 which fits into a corresponding second groove 162"<br>
on the top surface of the core tube 106 to form a more water tight seal for the<br>
hollow post 156, as shown in FIG. 10A. The seal is provided by an O-ring on the<br>
periphery of the end-cap 114a.<br>
The cell 1 02 can also have other embodiments, such as for example, a plate and frame configuration, as shown in FIG. 11. In this embodiment, the electrochemical cell 1 02 comprises a cartridge 100 having a number of<br>
textured membranes 10a-g having a rectangular shape, which are stacked on<br>
top of one another and attached to the sidewalls 122 of the cell to form an<br>
intermingled arrangement. The membranes 10a-g are separated by gaskets<br>
104 and spacers 108 between pairs of adjacent membranes. Openings 121 are<br>
punched into one end of each membrane 10a-g just inside the outline of the<br>
gasket 104, and the membranes 10 a-g are positioned such that the openings<br>
are positioned on alternating ends of the stack to form unitary and continuous<br>
solution passageway 115 through the cartridge 100. The gaskets 104 are<br><br><br>
flexible to prevent leakage of the solution through the sidewalls 122 of the<br>
cartridge 100, and are made of an electricajly insulating material to prevent<br>
shorting or divergence of the electrical current channel through the sidewalls<br>
122. This forces the electrical current channel, or the electrical field between the<br>
electrodes 124, 128 to be directed substantially perpendicularly through the<br>
plane of the membranes 10 a-g to provide more efficient, ion removal or<br>
replacement. The spacers 108 may be integral spacersc(not shown) or<br>
separable spacers 108 (as shown) such as netting made; from a dielectric<br>
material, such as plastic. The spacers 108 separate the membranes 10 a-g to<br>
provide more uniform solution flow and create turbulence in the solution stream<br>
passageway 115 to provide higher ion transport rates. Two electrodes 124, 128<br>
voltage over a time period and then dividing the integral by the time period. The<br>
polarity of the integration tells whether one is in Ion removal or rejection mode,<br>
and the magnitude of this calculation is proportional' to the electrical energy<br>
made available for Ion removal or rejection. An output Ion sensor 144 can also<br>
be positioned in the solution stream exterior to the outlets 18 (as shown) or<br>
interior to the housing 129 to determine the ion concentration of the treated<br>
solution. The ion sensor 144 can measure, for example, concentration, species,<br>
or ratio of concentrations of Ions in the treated solution. In one version, the Ion<br>
sensor 144 is a conductivity sensor, which is useful to determine and control<br>
total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration in the treated effluent solution 20.<br>
Alternatively, the Ion sensor 144 can be a sensor specific to a particular Ionic<br>
species, for example nitrate, arsenic or lead. The ion specific sensor can be, for<br>
example, ISE (Ion selective electrode). Generally, it is preferred to place the Ion<br>
sensor 144 as far upstream as possible to obtain the earliest measurement.<br><br><br>
The earlier the Ion senior measurement can be determined in this embodiment<br>
the more precisely can be controlled the Ion concentration of the treated<br>
solution-: 	<br>
A controller 138 can operate the power supply 134 in response to an Ion<br>
concentration signal received from.the Ion sensor 144 via a closed control<br>
feedback loop 142. The controller 138 is any device capable: of receiving,:<br>
processing and forwarding the Ion sensor signal to the power supply 134 in<br>
order to adjust the voltage: levels such as for example,.: a. general purpose<br>
computer having a CPU, memory, Input devices and display - or even a.<br>
hardware controller with suitable circuitry. In one version, the controller sends a<br>
control signal to the power supply 134 to control the voltage output to the<br>
electrodes 124, 128. The controller 138 comprises electronic circuitry and<br>
program code to receive, evaluate, and send signals. For example, the<br>
controller can comprise (I) a programmable Integrated circuit chip or a central<br>
processing unit (CPU), (II) random access memory and stored memory, (III)<br>
peripheral Input and output devices such as keyboards and displays, and (IV)<br>
hardware Interface boards comprising analog, digital Input and output boards,<br>
and communication boards. The controller can also comprise program code<br>
instructions stored in the memory that is capable of controlling and monitoring<br>
the electrochemical cell 102, Ion sensor 144, and power supply 134. The<br>
program code may be written in any conventional voltage over a time period<br>
and then dividing the integral by the time period. The polarity of the integration<br>
tells whether one is in Ion removal or rejection mode, and the magnitude of this<br>
calculation is proportional' to the electrical energy made available for ion<br><br><br>
removal or rejection.<br>
An output Ion sensor 144 can also be positioned in the solution stream exterior<br>
to the outlet 118 (as shown) or interior to the housing 129 to determine the ion<br>
concentration of the treated solution. The ion sensor 144 can measure, for<br>
example, concentration, species, or ratio of concentrations of Ions in the treated<br>
solution:, In one version, the Ion sensor 144 is a conductivity sensor, which, is::<br>
useful to determine and control total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration in the treated,effluent solution 20. Alternatively, the Ion sensor 144 can be a sensor<br>
specific to a particular Ionic species, for example nitrate, arsenic or lead. The"<br>

TOS reduction and the one square meter serve as the normalization factors).<br>
Let L = 0.1, A = 0.482, and ones calculates N = 3.16. Thus:the geometric area<br>
of membrane to treat 1 liter of water to 90% TDS reduction is 0.316 m2; and the<br>
liters of water which can be reduced by 90% TDS reduction under the specified<br>
conditions is 3:16 Ilterslm2. One can then compare various membranes,<br>
textured and untextured, by the volume of water that can be treated to 90%<br>
TDS reduction, as an example, per. 1 m2 membrane.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The following examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ion, controlling<br>
apparatus 120, electrochemical cell 1 02, and membranes 10 fabricated<br>
according to the present Invention. In these examples, membranes 10 were<br>
fabricated by different methods and their Ion exchange performance in<br>
electrochemical cells evaluated for comparisons.<br>
Examples 1 and 2<br>
These examples were performed to compare the performance of a conventional<br>
first electrochemical cell having un-textured membranes to the performance of a<br><br><br>
second electrochemical cell 1 02 fabricated with textured membranes 10. In-both types of cells, the membranes were made by laminatingjogether a pair of cation<br>
and anion exchange layers. The cation exchange layer was made from a mixture<br>
of 72 wt% strong acid ion exchange resin powder with the trade name CG8<br>
PWD available from Resintech, mixed with a polyethylene binder, such as SLX<br>
9090 from Exxon. The anion exchange layer 12 was made from a mixture of 65-<br>
wt% strong base Ion exchange resin powder with the tradename SBG LP-PWD,<br>
also available from Resintech and the same polyethylene binder. The anion and<br>
cation exchange materials were each separately mixed on a Banbury, mixer:<br>
Each of the mixed compositions were then separately pressedtintor slabs,<br>
swollen in water, then cut into the 7 by 14. cm pieces. Pairs of anion, and cation<br>
exchange slabs were laid on top of each other to form a membrane sheet:<br>
In Example. 1, a conventional electrochemical first cell, similar to the one shown<br>
in FIG 7, was built using a plate and frame construction. Seven un-extured<br>
(flat) water swollen membrane sheets, each about 2 mm thick provided a total<br>
geometric area of about 0.0702 m2. Holes were punched into one end, of each<br>
5 membrane sheets at the comers just inside the gasket outline, and the<br>
membrane sheets were stacked on one another with the holes positioned on<br>
alternating ends of the stack to build a plate and frame cell. The membrane<br>
sheets were separated by rubber gaskets (1 mm thick) with dielectric netting<br>
(also 1 mm thick) to prevent membranes from contacting one another.<br>
Two electrodes each comprising contiguous sheet titanium coated with a<br>
proprietary noble metal catalyst, referred to as DSA electrode, available from<br><br><br>
Electrode Corporation were positioned on the two-ends of stack. This stack was<br>
placed between two rigid plastic plates sized 17 cm by 10 cm and 2.5 cm thick.<br>
The plates, membranes and gaskets were compressed using metal bolts<br>
passing through the edges of the plates. Electrical connections were made<br>
between the electrodes and washers mounted on the outside of the plastic<br>
plates using metal springs.	<br>
A power supply was used to supply a current to the electrodes of the first cell that<br>
was limited to no more than 240.mA ata, voltage of 120.V: The;cell was then:<br>
regenerated with water having a conductivity of 60 uS/cm at 20 ml/minute for a<br>
total of 30 minutes. A water solution stream comprising 380 ml of a 750 ppm<br>
NaCI (having a conductivity of 1550 uS/cm) at a flow rate of 50 ml/minute was<br>
deionized in the cell. The total dissolved solids (TDS) removed from the treated<br>
solution from the first cell 2S was measured as 89%. Using the power law<br>
normalization technique to calculate the volume of water each square meter of<br>
membrane treated under these flow and power conditions to provide 90%R;: one<br>
obtains 4.711 ters/m2 geometric membrane area for this deionizatlon volume with<br>
the recited regeneration and deionization conditions using untextured membrane.<br>
In Example 2, a second electrochemical cell 1 02 was fabricated with textured<br>
membranes 10 fabricated by embossing the dry, flat water-splitting membrane<br>
sheets used for Example 1. Pairs of cation and anion exchange slabs were<br>
pressed between two rigid, metal textured plates in a hot press to form texture<br>
features 26 shaped as parallel, spaced apart, ridges 36 and furrows 38, on both<br>
sides of the membrane 10, and running parallel to the direction that the solution<br>
stream would run across the membrane. The texture features 26 had dpv (peak<br><br><br>
to valley) dimensions of about 0.08 cm and dpp (peak to peak) dimensions of<br>
0.15 em/these textured 5 membranes 10 were swollen in water and cut into seven 7 cm by 14 cm slabs, providing a total geometric area of about 0.0702.m2.<br>
Cell construction and operation were provided as in Example 1. This second cell<br>
1 02 provided a TOS reduction of 95% for the same 0.38 liters of 750 ppm NaCI<br>
deionized in. the cell; this equates to 6.8 Iiters/m2 membrane for 90%:TOS<br>
reduction when using these textured membranes.	<br>
Thus, the secondxell. 1 02 of Example 2 having: textured membranes-provided a<br>
45% Improvement: in membrane performance as compared with the first cell of<br>
Example 1 which had un-textured membranes. This represented a significant and<br>
unexpected improvement in membrane performance for the same geometric<br>
area of membranes and process conditions." 	<br>
Examples 3 and 4	<br>
In these examples, the performance of a cell having spirally wound un: 20<br>
textured membranes was compared to a cell 1 02 having spirally wound textured membranes 10. In both cells, the membranes 10 were fabricated from a cation<br>
exchange layer 14 made from a blend of 60 wt% strong acid Ion exchange resin<br>
powder (CG8-PWO; from Resintech) and 40 wt% polyethylene (SLX-9090; from<br>
Exxon), and an anion exchange layer 12 made from 65 wt% anion exchange<br>
resin 25 powder (SBG1 P-PWO; Resintech) and 34 wt% of the polyethylene. The<br>
Ion exchange resin powders are 
and anion exchange materials were each mixed on a Banbury mixer taking care<br>
not to thermally degrade the ion exchange resins. Membrane sheets were<br><br><br>
formed by sheet extrusion using a 25.4 cm wide extrusion die. The cation<br><br>
exchange layer was extruded first to form a 0.025 cm thick sheet, and the anion<br>
exchange layer extruded on top of this to produce a water-splitting membrane. A<br>
second calendaring step using the extrusion roll stack was employed to thin the<br>
sheet to 0.028 cm thick, and upon swelling in. water the flat water splitting<br>
membrane sheet was about 0.038 cm thick. <br>
layers around the<br>
net tube prepared<br>
In Example 3, a cartridge for a third cell was formed by spirally winding around a-<br>
core tube six membrane pieces, each 100cm long and 15 cm wide, and with six<br>
plastic netting spacers (0.010 Inch) thick (Netting:4122; Delstar) there between<br>
The 12 layers were wound by laying them on a flat surface one on top of the<br>
other in an alternating pattern, with each membrane separated by a spacer net,<br>
and the membrane ends offset by 1 cm. A rigid plastic netting tube 15 cm long.<br>
(RN 2540; Internet, Inc.) was used as the core tube around which the<br>
membranes and spacers were wound. After roiling the 12 membrane and spacer,<br>
core tube, the wound assembly was contained with a larger<br>
from flat netting (XN 1678; 10. Internet, Inc.). This wound,<br>
assembly was cut to 13.0 cm in length, and the two end caps were attached with<br>
thermoplastic adhesive. One of the end caps comprised an Oring to provide a<br>
sealed passage for water to flow into and out of the cartridge. The final cartridge<br>
with end caps was 13.8 cm tall with an 8.9 cm diameter, and comprised 0.78 m2<br>
of water-splitting membrane. A cartridge according to Example 3 was<br>
characterized by placing it in a cylindrical housing comprising an inner and outer<br>
electrode, a central riser tube as one housing port, and a second port near the<br>
top of the housing's outer wall. The cartridge was first regenerated over 20<br><br><br><br>
minutes with water flow in the direction inside to outside (feed water conductivity<br>
was 50 uS/cm), power was limited to a maximum current of 0.5 Amps at 250<br>
Volts, and flow rate was 0.1 liters/mln to produce a 2 liter waste volume (average<br>
conductivity of 1750 uS/cm). For de-lonization, electrode polarity and flow<br>
direction were reversed, and feed water (950 uS/cm) was pumped into the cell at<br>
0.60 liters/minute to produce 6.4 liters exhibiting 67% TDS reduction. Using the<br>
power law 25 normalization technique to calculate the volume of water each<br>
square meter of membrane can treat under these flow and power conditions to<br>
provide 90%R (TDS reduction), one obtains 4:9 Iiters/m2 area for this<br>
deionization volume for this untextured membrane. 	<br>
In Example 4, a cartridge for a fourth cell 1 02 was fabricated from textured<br>
membranes 10 having texture features 26 shaped as parallel, spaced apart<br>
ridges 36 and furrows 38, with a dpv (peak to valley) dimensions of about 0.020<br>
em and dpp (peak to peak) dimensions of 0.030 cm. The textured membrane 10<br>
was prepared from the same flat, 0.028 cm thick, two-layer membrane sheet<br>
used in the previous cell, by passing this membrane sheet between two metal a<br>
rolls having the desired texture pattern, as shown in FIG. 5. In the texturizing<br>
step, the flat membrane sheet was passed through a short pre-heater to soften<br>
the membrane 10, then between the textured rolls themselves, which were also<br>
heated to a temperature sufficiently high (about 100 C) to Impress the texture<br>
pattern into the membrane sheet. The textured membrane sheet was<br>
subsequently swollen in water to provide a textured membrane 10 for spiral<br>
winding into a cartridge.<br>
The cartridge in Example 4 was constructed exactly as In Example 3, and 10<br><br><br>
characterized in the same cell under the identical conditions. Thus the<br>
membrane geometric surface area remained 0.78 m2. The regeneration water<br>
volume was 2450 uS/cm. The 6.4-liter deionizatlon volume exhibited 90% TDS<br>
reduction. Using the power law normalization, this equates to 7.4 Ilters/m2 to<br>
obtain 90% TDS reduction for this deionization volume using this textured<br>
membrane.	<br>
Thus a 51% Improvement in membrane 10 performance was realized for the: spiral wound cell of Example 4 which had textured membranes, as compared to<br>
the spiral wound cell of Example 3 which was made from un-textured membrane<br>
having the same geometric area.<br>
Examples 5 and 6	<br>
These examples demonstrate the excellent performance of a cartridge<br>
comprising textured membranes 10 having integral spacers 80, as compared<br>
with a cartridge having textured membranes 10 that are separated by separate<br>
spacer layers.		<br>
In Example 5, a cartridge 100 was prepared from textured membranes 10<br>
comprising about 50 wt% of weak acid cation exchange resin (HP333 from<br>
Rohm and Haas) and strong base anion exchange resin (SIR100 from<br>
Resintech). Six membrane sleeves were constructed, each sleeve being about<br>
85 cm 16ng and 0.064 cm thick, and six 30 0.0254 cm (10 mil) thick netting<br>
spacers were wound and trimmed to a total length of 13.8 cm, which was then<br>
fitted with end-caps. Thus total membrane surface geometric area was 0.70 m2<br>
and the diameter was 8.9 cm. The cartridge was characterized in an<br><br><br>
electrochemical cell as described, in Examples 3 and 4, to provide 90%\TDS<br>
reduction from6.4 liters of a solution stream of water with an initial conductivity<br>
of 950 J,JS/cm. The pressure drop to provide 0.60-liters/minute-flow rate was 6<br>
psi.<br>
In Example 6, prior to swelling the textured membranes 10 with water; a 5 A<br>
spacer 80 was formed on the membranes 10 by spraying filaments 82 from a<br>
thermoplastic spray gun assembly onto the cation exchange layer 14 of the<br>
membrane 10. The filamentS:82 were made with a Pro-Flex Application systems<br>
available from Hot Melt Technologies, Michigan. The- filaments 82 were:,/<br>
approximately 50 microns (0.002 inch) in diameter and sprayed in a randoms<br>
pattern. The spraying process conditions resulted in an integral spacer 80 which rested on top of the texture features 26 of the membrane 10, as shown in FIG.<br>
4. Each integral spacer 80 had an average thickness of about 0.0175 cm (0.007<br>
inch). Eight membrane sleeves each 75 cm long were wrapped on themselves<br>
without the use of separate spacers, the wound membrane trimmed to 13.8 cm<br>
and end-caps applied. The total membrane area in the cartridge was 0.83 m2<br>
and the diameter was 8.9 cm (19% greater membrane area in the same volume<br>
as for Example 5). This cartridge was characterized in Example 5 to provide<br>
84% TDS reduction from 6.4 liters of challenge water. The pressure drop to<br>
provide 0.60-liters/minute-flow rate was 9 psi.<br>
These results indicate that the integral spacer 80 provide a TDS reduction<br>
almost the same as that of the separate spacer between the textured<br>
membranes 10, while reducing the volume of the cartridge by about 7%. In<br><br><br>
addition, the integral spacer 80 was found to have excellent adherence to the<br>
membranes 10, thereby facilitating assembly of the membranes and spacer<br>
layers into a cartridge configuration.<br>
The electrochemical cell of the present invention provides several advantages.<br>
The surface textured membranes 10 with the integral spacer 80 maintains a<br>
small, uniform and even gap between the membranes 10 while reducing the<br>
overall.volume occupied by the electrochemical cell 1. 02.
