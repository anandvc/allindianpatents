ADHESIVE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive composition containing<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer having a predetermined structure and a tackifier.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, hot-melt adhesives have been widely used because those are<br>
excellent from environmental viewpoints and for their convenience.<br>
As a base polymer for the hot-melt adhesives, vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon-<br>
conjugated diene based block copolymers (SBS) are known for their high versatility.<br>
Also in the related art, an adhesive composition using the block copolymer has<br>
been disclosed (for example, see Patent Literatures 1 and 2.). Generally, however,<br>
the SBS has poor thermal stability, and the adhesive composition using this is likely<br>
to be less balanced between retentivity and tackiness, and have high melt viscosity<br>
and insufficient processability. For this reason, an adhesive composition composed<br>
of a triblock copolymer and a diblock copolymer has been proposed as an improved<br>
technique for these (for example, see Patent Document 3 and Non Patent Document<br>
1).<br>
Moreover, an adhesive composition composed of a block copolymer obtained<br>
by performing coupling with a specific bifunctional coupling agent (an aliphatic<br>
monoester, a specific dihalogen compound) has been proposed (for example, see<br>
Patent Document 4).<br>
Further, a composition containing a block copolymer obtained by<br>
hydrogenating a block copolymer of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon and a conjugated<br>
diene based compound and a tackifier has been proposed as further improvement of<br>
these related arts (for example, see Patent Document 5.).<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
However, each of the above-mentioned related arts needs to be much further<br>
improved in order to satisfy ail the properties that while the retentivity and the<br>
tackiness are kept well-balanced, the melt viscosity is reduced simultaneously, and<br>
high stability in the melt viscosity is attained under high temperature.<br>
Then, an object of the present invention is to provide an adhesive composition<br>
satisfying these properties.<br>

Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment for implementing the present invention<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as the "present embodiment") will be described in detail.<br>
The present invention will not be limited to the embodiment below, and various<br>
modifications can be made and implemented within the scope of the gist.<br>

[0015]<br>
Hereinafter, the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and the (1-B)<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer will be described in detail.<br>
[0016]<br>
Examples of monomeric units of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon that<br>
constitutes the hydrogenated block copolymers of the (1-A) and the (1-B) include<br>
alkyl styrene such as styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, and p-tert-<br>
butylstyrene, p-methoxystyrene, and vinyl naphthalene. Particularly, styrene is<br>
preferable. These may be used alone, or may be used in combination of two or<br>
more.<br>
[0017]<br>

copolymers of the (1-A) and the (1-B) is a diolefin having one pair of conjugated<br>
double bonds.<br>
Examples thereof include 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (isoprene),<br>
2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, and 1,3-hexadiene. These may be<br>
used alone, or may be used in combination of two or more.<br>
[0018]<br>
The block copolymers before hydrogenation of the hydrogenated block<br>
copolymers of the (1-A) and the (1-B) can be each produced with a known<br>
polymerization method.<br>
For example, methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 36-19286,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 43-17979, Japanese Patent Publication No. 46-<br>
32415, Japanese Patent Publication No. 49-36957, Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
56-28925, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 59-166518 can be<br>
applied.<br>
[0019]<br>
The block copolymer at a stage prior to hydrogenation of the (1-A)<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer is represented by the general formulas: (C-D)m and D-<br>
(C-D)m. m is an integer of not less than one, and usually an integer of 1 to 5. in<br>
terms of tackiness, it is preferable that a terminal is a block D. The structure of C-D<br>
is most preferable in terms of tackiness and melt viscosity.<br>
Here, C is a polymer block mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
and D is a polymer mainly composed of a conjugated diene compound.<br>
The boundary between the C block and the D block does not always need to<br>
be distinguished clearly.<br>
[0020]<br>
The block copolymer of the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer at a stage<br>
prior to hydrogenation is represented by the general formulas: (C-D)n, C-(D-C)m, and<br>
D-(C-D)m.<br>
Here, C is a polymer block mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
and D is a polymer mainly composed of a conjugated diene compound.<br>
The boundary between the C block and the D block does not always need to<br>
be distinguished clearly.<br>
Moreover, n is an integer of not less than two, and m is an integer of not less<br>
than one and usually an integer of 1 to 5.<br>
[0021]<br>
The block copolymer of the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer at a stage<br>
prior to hydrogenation can be represented by the general formulas: [(D-C)n]m + 1-X,<br>
[<c-d and></c-d>
Here, C is a polymer block mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
and D is a polymer mainly composed of a conjugated diene compound.<br>
The boundary between the C block and the D block does not always need to<br>
be distinguished clearly.<br>
Moreover, n is an integer of not less than two.<br>
X designates a residue of a coupling agent such as tetrachlorosilane, tin<br>
tetrachloride, epoxidized soybean oil, bifunctional to hexafunctional epoxy group<br>
containing compounds, polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, carboxylate esters, and<br>
polyvinyl compounds such as divinylbenzenes, or a residue of an initiator such as<br>
polyfunctional organolithium compounds, for example.<br>
m is an integer of not less than one, and usually an integer of 1 to 10.<br>
[0022]<br>
Herein, the "polymer block mainly composed of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon"<br>
designates a copolymer block of a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon and a conjugated<br>
diene compound and/or a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon homopolymer block, the<br>
copolymer block containing not less than 50% by mass and preferably not less than<br>
70% by mass of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
Moreover, herein, the "polymer block mainly composed of a conjugated diene<br>
compound" designates a copolymer block of a conjugated diene compound and a<br>
vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon and/or a conjugated diene compound homopolymer block,<br>
the copolymer block containing the conjugated diene compound more than 50% by<br>
mass and preferably not less than 70% by mass.<br>
[0023]<br>
The vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon may be distributed uniformly or may be<br>
distributed in a tapered state in the block copolymer of the (1-A) hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer before hydrogenation and the block copolymer of the (1-B) hydrogenated<br>
block copolymer before hydrogenation.<br>
Moreover, a plurality of portions where the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon is<br>
distributed uniformly and/or a plurality of portions where the vinyl aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon is distributed in a tapered state may exist together.<br>
[0024]<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymers (1) that constitute the adhesive<br>
composition according to the present embodiment may be an arbitrary combination<br>
of the respective hydrogenated products of the block copolymers represented by the<br>
general formulas mentioned above.<br>
[0025]<br>
The vinyl bond amounts V (%) of the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and<br>
the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer based on the conjugated diene compound<br>
before hydrogenation that constitutes the block copolymer are each preferably 10 to<br>
80%, more preferably 20 to 70%, still more preferably 25 to 70%, and further still<br>
more preferably 25 to 37%.<br>
[0026]<br>
Here, the "vinyl bond amount" means a ratio of the conjugated diene<br>
compounds incorporated with the 1,2-bond and 3,4-bond among the conjugated<br>
diene compounds incorporated with bonding patterns of the 1,2-bond, 3,4-bond and<br>
1,4-bond in the block copolymer.<br>
When the "vinyl bond amount" is less than 10% by mass or more than 80% by<br>
mass, the affinity of the hydrogenated block copolymer (1) with the tackifier (2)<br>
worsens so that sufficient tackiness is not obtained in the final target adhesive<br>
composition.<br>
The "vinyl bond amount V (%)" can be adjusted when the block copolymer is<br>
produced using ether compounds such as dimethyl ether, diethylether, diphenyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether;<br>
or tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethylethylene diamine, and diazobicyclo[2,2,2]octane as a vinylating agent.<br>
[0027]<br>
The (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and the (1-B) hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer are obtained by hydrogenating each of the block copolymers mentioned<br>
above (hydrogenation reaction).<br>
Examples of a catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction include supported<br>
heterogeneous catalysts in which a metal such as Ni, Pt, Pd, and Ru is supported on<br>
carbon, silica, alumina, diatom earth, and the like; the so-called Ziegler type catalysts<br>
using a transition metal salt such as an organic acid salt of Ni, Co, Fe, and Cr or an<br>
acetylacetone salt thereof, and a reducing agent such as organic aluminum; and<br>
homogeneous catalysts such as the so-called organometallic complexes such as<br>
organometallic compounds of Ti, Ru, Rh, and Zr.<br>
Examples of the method for the hydrogenation reaction include methods<br>
described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 42-8704, Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 43-6636, Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-4841, Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 01-37970, Japanese Patent Publication No. 01-53851, and Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 02-9041.<br>
Specifically, a hydrogenated product is obtained by performing hydrogenation<br>
in a hydrocarbon solvent under presence of a hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
At that time, the degree of hydrogenation of the block copolymer can be<br>
controlled by adjusting a reaction temperature, a reaction time, the amount of<br>
hydrogen to be supplied, the amount of the catalyst, and the like.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and the (1-B) hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer, the total degree of hydrogenation H (%) of unsaturated double bonds<br>
based on the conjugated diene compound is 10 to 80%. In the relationship with the<br>
vinyl bond amount V (%)based on the conjugated diene compound that constitutes<br>
the block copolymer before the hydrogenation, a relationship of V 
preferably satisfied, and a relationship of V 
Here, H 
preferably H 
When the total degree of hydrogenation H (%) of unsaturated double bonds<br>
based on the conjugated diene compound is less than 10%, the thermal stability of<br>
the adhesive composition finally obtained is inferior. When the total degree of<br>
hydrogenation H (%) exceeds 80%, the tackiness of the adhesive composition finally<br>
obtained is inferior. Accordingly, both cases are not preferable.<br>
Moreover, in the case where the degree of hydrogenation H (%) is less than<br>
the vinyl bond amount V (%), the thermal stability of the adhesive composition finally<br>
obtained is inferior. In the case where the degree of hydrogenation H (%) exceeds<br>
the upper limit of V 
obtained is inferior. Accordingly, both cases are not preferable.<br>
Further, when the total degree of hydrogenation H (%) of unsaturated double<br>
bonds based on the conjugated diene compound satisfies V 
exceeds 80%, the tackiness of the adhesive composition finally obtained is inferior.<br>
Accordingly, the both conditions are preferably satisfied.<br>
The total degree of hydrogenation H (%) of unsaturated double bonds based<br>
on the conjugated diene compound can be measured with an infrared<br>
spectrophotometer, a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus (NMR), and the like.<br>
The vinyl bond amount V (%) based on the conjugated diene compound before<br>
hydrogenation that constitutes the block copolymer can be measured with a nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance apparatus (NMR).<br>
[0029]<br>
In the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and the (1-B) hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer, the degree of hydrogenation of the vinyl bonds in the conjugated diene<br>
before hydrogenation (S(%): the ratio of the vinyl bonds hydrogenated based on the<br>
vinyl bonds in the conjugated diene) is preferably not less than 82%, more preferably<br>
not less than 85%, and still more preferably not less than 87%.<br>
When the degree of hydrogenation is less than 82%, it is not preferable<br>
because the stability in melt viscosity of the finally obtained adhesive composition<br>
under high temperature heating conditions deteriorates.<br>
The degree of hydrogenation of the vinyl bonds in the conjugated diene before<br>
hydrogenation can be measured with an infrared spectrophotometer, a nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance apparatus (NMR), and the like.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and the (1-B) hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer, the degree of hydrogenation of the aromatic double bonds based on the<br>
vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons before hydrogenation is preferably not more than 50%,<br>
more preferably not more than 30%, and still more preferably not more than 20%.<br>
[0031]<br>
The degree of hydrogenation of the aromatic double bonds based on the vinyl<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons before hydrogenation can be measured with an infrared<br>
spectrophotometer, a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus (NMR), and the like.<br>
[0032]<br>
(Content of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons in the hydrogenated block copolymers<br>
(1-A)and(1-B))<br>
The content of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons in the (1-A) hydrogenated<br>
block copolymer and the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer is 20 to 60% by mass,<br>
preferably 30 to 60% by mass, and more preferably 37 to 60% by mass.<br>
When the content of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons is less than 20% by mass,<br>
the retentivity of the adhesive composition finally obtained deteriorates. When the<br>
content of the vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons of more than 60% by mass, the tackiness<br>
of the adhesive composition finally obtained deteriorates.<br>
[0033]<br>
(Molecular weight of the hydrogenated block copolymers (1-A) and (1-B))<br>
The (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer has a peak molecular weight of<br>
30,000 to 60,000 measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with<br>
polystyrene as standard, and preferably a peak molecular weight of 35,000 to 55,000.<br>
At a peak molecular weight of the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer of less<br>
than 30,000, the retentivity of the final target adhesive composition deteriorates. At<br>
a peak molecular weight of the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer exceeding<br>
60,000, the melt viscosity is increased so that application performance of the<br>
adhesive composition and the like deteriorate. Accordingly, both cases are not<br>
preferable.<br>
Moreover, the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer has a peak molecular<br>
weight of more than 60,000 and less than 100,000 measured by GPC with<br>
polystyrene as standard, and preferably a peak molecular weight of 65,000 to 95,000.<br>
When the peak molecular weight of the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer is not<br>
more than 60,000, the retentivity of the final target adhesive composition deteriorates.<br>
When the peak molecular weight of the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer is not<br>
less than 100,000, the melt viscosity is increased so that application performance of<br>
the adhesive composition and the like also deteriorate. Accordingly, both cases are<br>
not preferable.<br>
[0034]<br>
(Content of the hydrogenated block copolymers (1-A) and (1-B))<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymer (1) contains 30 to 90% by mass of the (1 -<br>
A) hydrogenated block copolymer and preferably 40 to 85% by mass, and 70 to 10%<br>
by mass of the (1-B) hydrogenated block copolymer and preferably 65 to 15% by<br>
mass.<br>
Thereby, a well-balanced adhesive composition in the retentivity, the tackiness,<br>
the melt viscosity, and the like is obtained.<br>
[0035]<br>
(Molecular weight of the hydrogenated block copolymer (1))<br>
From the viewpoint of the balance between the retentivity and the tackiness of<br>
the final target adhesive composition and the melt viscosity thereof, the molecular<br>
weight of the hydrogenated block copolymer (the peak molecular weight measured<br>
by GPC with polystyrene as standard) (1) is preferably 35,000 to 95,000, and more<br>
preferably 40,000 to 90,000.<br>
[0036]<br>
[Method for producing the hydrogenated block copolymer (1)]<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymer (1) is obtained as follows, for example: two<br>
kinds of block copolymers that are styrene butadiene block copolymers and have a<br>
different molecular weight are produced separately using a method for polymerizing<br>
styrene in an inert hydrocarbon solvent by using an organolithium compound as a<br>
polymerization initiator, then, polymerizing butadiene, and further repeating these<br>
operations depending on cases; the two kinds of block copolymers are subjected to<br>
the hydrogenation reaction; and subsequently, these hydrogenated block copolymers<br>
are mixed with each other.<br>
The molecular weight of the hydrogenated block copolymer (1) can be<br>
controlled by adjusting the amount of the organolithium compound.<br>
[0037]<br>
Mixing the hydrogenated block copolymers is conducted as follows: the<br>
hydrogenation reaction is conducted after the end of the polymerization reaction;<br>
polymerization solutions of the respective components to which water, an alcohol, an<br>
acid, or the like is added to deactivate active species are blended in a predetermined<br>
composition; subsequently, for example, steam stripping or the like is conducted to<br>
separate the blended polymerization solvent, and drying is performed.<br>
Moreover, the polymers separately obtained by separating and drying the<br>
polymerization solvent may be blended with a predetermined roll or the like.<br>
[0038]<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymer (1) can also be produced with a production<br>
method different from the above-mentioned method.<br>
Namely, after the (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer is obtained, an<br>
appropriate coupling agent having not less than two functional groups with a<br>
predetermined amount relative to the organolithium compound used as the<br>
polymerization initiator is added to the polymerization system to obtain a copolymer<br>
product as a component (1-B). Thus, the hydrogenated block copolymers (1-A) and<br>
(1-B) are simultaneously obtained within the same reaction system.<br>
According to this method, the peak molecular weight of the component (1-B) is<br>
an integral multiple of the peak molecular weight of the component (1-A) according to<br>
the coupling agent, the content of the monoalkenyl aromatic compound in the<br>
component (1-A) is the same as that in the component (1-B). Although the structure<br>
is limited, the method is more industrially advantageous than the method mentioned<br>
above.<br>
In the above-mentioned production method, bifunctional, trifunctional,<br>
tetrafunctional, pentafunctional, and hexafunctional coupling agents are used as the<br>
coupling agent. Particularly, the bifunctional coupling agent is preferable.<br>
Examples thereof include halogenated silicon compounds such as dichloro<br>
dimethylsilane and phenylmethyl dichlorosilane; alkoxy silicon compounds such as<br>
dimethyldimethoxysilane; tin compounds such as dichloro dimethyltin; ester<br>
compounds such as methyl benzoate; vinyl allenes such as divinylbenzene; and<br>
bifunctional epoxy compounds.<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymers (1-A) and (1-B) mentioned above may<br>
have a form of a modified polymer in which a polar group containing functional group<br>
selected from nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and tin is bonded to a<br>
polymer, or that of a modified block copolymer in which a hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer is modified by maleic acid anhydride or the like.<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymer (1) is obtained by performing<br>
desolventization by a known method from the solution of the hydrogenated block<br>
copolymer (1) produced with the production method mentioned above. At this time,<br>
metals may be deashed when necessary, and a predetermined reaction terminator,<br>
antioxidant, neutralizer, surface active agent, and the like may be used.<br>
[0039]<br>
[(2) Tackifier]<br>
A material for the tackifier that constitutes the adhesive composition according<br>
to the present embodiment is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include<br>
resins having known adhesion assignment function, such as rosin terpene resins,<br>
hydrogenated rosin terpene resins, cumarone resins, phenol resins, terpene-phenol<br>
resins, aromatic hydrocarbon resins, and aliphatic hydrocarbon resins. Other than<br>
these, specifically, tackifiers described in "Compounding Ingredients for Rubber and<br>
Plastics" (edited by Rubber Digest Co., Ltd.), can be used.<br>
These may be used alone, or not less than two kinds thereof may be mixed<br>
and used.<br>
[0040]<br>
The amount of the tackifier (2) used is 20 to 400 parts by mass of the tackifier<br>
(2) based on 100 parts by mass of the hydrogenated block copolymer (1), and<br>
preferably 50 to 350 parts by mass.<br>
When the amount of the tackifier (2) is less than 20 parts by mass, sufficient<br>
tack strength is not obtained. On the other hand, when the amount of the tackifier<br>
(2) exceeds 400 parts by mass, the retentivity deteriorates. In the both cases, tacky<br>
and adhesive properties deteriorate.<br>
[0041]<br>
[Softener]<br>
Known naphthene based, paraffin based, and aroma based process oils may<br>
also be used for the adhesive composition in the present embodiment as a softening<br>
material. These may be used alone, or may be mixed and used.<br>
Use of the softener reduces the viscosity of the adhesive composition so that<br>
effects of improvement in processability and that in adhesive improvement are<br>
obtained.<br>
However, the aroma based oils are likely to impair the color tone and the<br>
thermal stability of the final target adhesive composition. For that reason, it is<br>
necessary to determine the amount of the softener to be used according to a purpose.<br>
Specifically, in the case where the adhesive composition according to the<br>
present embodiment is used as an adhesive composition, the amount of the softener<br>
is preferably 0 to 50 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the hydrogenated<br>
block copolymer (1), more preferably 0 to 30 parts by mass, and still more preferably<br>
0 to 20 parts by mass. When the amount of the softener to be added exceeds 50<br>
parts by mass, sufficient adhesiveness may not be obtained in the adhesive<br>
composition.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the adhesive composition according to<br>
the present embodiment is used as a tacky composition, the amount of the softener<br>
is preferably 10 to 200 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer (1), and more preferably 20 to 180 parts by mass,<br>
and still more preferably 30 to 150 parts by mass. When the amount of the softener<br>
exceeds 200 parts by mass, sufficient retentivity may not be obtained.<br>
[0042]<br>
[Additives]<br>
Various additives such as an antioxidant and a light stabilizer may be added to<br>
the adhesive composition in the present embodiment when necessary.<br>
Examples of the antioxidant include hindered phenolic antioxidants such as<br>
2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)propionate, 2,2'-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol), 2,2'-<br>
methylenebis(4-ethyl-6-tert-butylphenol), 2,4-bis[(octylthio)methyl]-0-cresol, 2-tert-<br>
butyl-6-(3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenylacrylate, 2,4-di-tert-<br>
amyl-6-[1 -(3,5-di-tert-amyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]phenylacrylate, and 2-[1 -(2-<br>
hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-pentylphenyl)]acrylate; sulfur based antioxidants such as dilauryl<br>
thiodipropionate and lauryl stearyl thiodipropionate pentaerythritol-tetrakis(P-laurylthio<br>
propionate); and phosphorus based antioxidants such as tris(nonylphenyl)phosphite<br>
and tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite.<br>
Examples of the light stabilizer include benzotriazol based ultraviolet absorbing<br>
agents such as 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl) benzotriazol, 2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5'-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)benzotriazol, and 2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-tert-butylphenyl)-5-<br>
chlorobenzotriazole; benzophenone based ultraviolet absorbing agents such as 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone; and hindered amine light stabilizers.<br>
[0043]<br>
Moreover, pigments such as red iron oxide and titanium dioxide; waxes such<br>
as paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, and low molecular weight polyethylene wax;<br>
polyolefin based or low molecular weight vinyl aromatic based thermoplastic resins<br>
such as amorphous polyolefins and ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers; natural<br>
rubbers; and synthetic rubbers such as polyisoprene rubbers, polybutadiene rubbers,<br>
styrene-butadiene rubbers, ethylene-propylene rubbers, chloroprene rubbers, acrylic<br>
rubbers, isoprene-isobutylene rubbers, polypentenamer rubbers, and styrene-<br>
isoprene based block copolymers may be added to the adhesive composition in the<br>
present embodiment when necessary.<br>
[0044]<br>
[Method for producing an adhesive composition]<br>
The adhesive composition in the present embodiment can be produced with a<br>
known method.<br>
For example, the adhesive composition can be produced by evenly mixing the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer (1) mentioned above with the tackifier (2) under<br>
heating conditions using a predetermined mixer, kneader, or the like.<br>
Examples<br>
[0045]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be more specifically described using<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention will not be limited to<br>
the Examples below.<br>
[0046]<br>
First, a hydrogenated block copolymer (1) serving as a raw material was<br>
produced, and identified by measuring physical properties, and classified as<br>
Polymers 1 to 10.<br><method for measuring physical properties><br>
(Content of styrene)<br>
The content of styrene was calculated at an absorption intensity of 262 nm<br>
using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV200, manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.).<br>
(Peak molecular weight and composition ratio)<br>
GPC (a measuring apparatus: manufactured by Waters Co., Ltd.; columns:<br>
three columns in total, two ZORBAX PSM 1000S's and one PSM60-S manufactured<br>
by E. I. du Pont de Nemours) was used, and tetrahydrofuran was used as a solvent.<br>
The measurement condition was at a temperature of 35°C.<br>
With respect to the peak molecular weight, the molecular weight at a peak of<br>
the chromatogram was determined using a calibration curve determined from<br>
measurement of commercially available standard polystyrene (created using a peak<br>
molecular weight of standard polystyrene).<br>
The composition ratio in the case where the hydrogenated block copolymer (1)<br>
was composed of a (1-A) hydrogenated block copolymer and a (1-B) hydrogenated<br>
block copolymer was calculated based on a surface ratio of each peak of the<br>
chromatogram.<br>
(Vinyl bond amount and degree of hydrogenation)<br>
The vinyl bond amount and the degree of hydrogenation were measured using<br>
a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus (manufactured by Bruker Corporation,<br>
DPX-400).<br>
[0047]<br>
Preparation of a block copolymer and its hydrogenated product&gt;<br>
An autoclave having a volume of 100 L and including a stirrer and a jacket was<br>
washed, dried, and subjected to replacement by nitrogen. A cyclohexane solution<br>
containing 40 parts by mass of styrene and subjected to a purification treatment in<br>
advance was placed into the autoclave.<br>
Next, n-butyllithium and tetramethylethylene diamine were added, and the<br>
polymerization reaction was conducted at 70°C for 1 hour.<br>
Subsequently, a cyclohexane solution containing 60 parts by mass of<br>
butadiene and subjected to a purification treatment in advance was added, and the<br>
polymerization reaction was conducted for 1 hour.<br>
Then, phenylmethyl dichlorosilane was added as a coupling agent to perform<br>
coupling, and a mixture of a coupled polymer and an uncoupled polymer was<br>
obtained.<br>
A part of the obtained block copolymer solutions was sampled, and 0.3 parts<br>
by mass of octadecyl-3-(3,5-dibutyl-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate was added<br>
to 100 parts by mass of the block copolymer. Subsequently, the solution was<br>
heated to remove the solvent.<br>
The block copolymer thus obtained was referred to as Polymer 1.<br>
In Polymer 1, the content of styrene was 40% by mass, the 1,2-vinyl bond<br>
amount of polybutadiene was 34% by mass, and the molecular weight was 88,000.<br>
[0048]<br>
Next, the block copolymer solution at a stage prior to sampling was<br>
hydrogenated under a temperature condition of 70°C by using di-p-tolylbis(1-<br>
cyclopentadienyl)titanium and n-butyllithium as a hydrogenation catalyst. A part of<br>
the polymer solution was sampled and was referred to as Polymer 2.<br>
In this Polymer 2, the total degree of hydrogenation H of unsaturated double<br>
bonds based on butadiene (hereinafter, referred to as the "degree of hydrogenation<br>
H.") was 41 %, and the degree of hydrogenation of vinyl bonds was 92%.<br>
[0049]<br>
The amounts of n-butyllithium, tetramethylethylene diamine, and phenylmethyl<br>
dichlorosilane to be added were changed. While other conditions were the same,<br>
polymerization was conducted with the same method as in the case of Polymer 1<br>
mentioned above to obtain a block copolymer solution.<br>
Subsequently, hydrogenation was conducted with the same method as in the<br>
case of Polymer 2 mentioned above using this block copolymer solution. Thus,<br>
Polymer 3 to Polymer 12 were produced.<br>
Table 1 below shows the properties of Polymers 1 to 12.<br>
[0051]<br>
Next, samples of the adhesive composition were produced using Polymers 1<br>
to 12 produced as mentioned above.<br>
[0052]<br>
[Examples 1 to 7], [Comparative Examples 1 to 5]<br>
(Hydrogenated) block copolymer (or Polymers 1 to 10): 100 parts by mass<br>
Tackifier (ARKON M100 (manufactured by Arakawa Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd.)): 300 parts by mass<br>
Softener (Diana Process Oil PW-90 (manufactured by Idemitsu Kosan Co.,<br>
Ltd.)): 100 parts by mass<br>
These were blended and melt kneaded with a 1-L container having a stirrer at<br>
180°C for 2 hours to obtain a target hot-melt adhesive composition.<br>
In the adhesive composition, 1 part by mass of 2-tert-butyl-6-(3-tert-butyl-2-<br>
hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenylacrylate was blended as a stabilizer based<br>
on 100 parts by mass of the (hydrogenated) block copolymer (Polymers 1 to 10).<br>
[0053]<br>
[Comparative Examples 6 and 7]<br>
An adhesive composition was produced by the same method under the same<br>
condition as that in Example 1 except that the amounts of the tackifier and the<br>
softener to be blended were changed.<br>
[0054]<br><measurement and evaluation of the adhesive composition><br>
The following physical properties were measured with respect to the adhesive<br>
compositions of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7.<br>
Table 2 below shows measurement results.<br>
[0055]<br>
(Melt viscosity)<br>
Using a Brookfield type viscometer, the melt viscosity of the adhesive<br>
composition under a temperature condition of 140°C was measured.<br>
[0056]<br>
(Loop tack (N/15 mm))<br>
A looped sample having a length of 250 mm x a width of 15 mm was used, and<br>
measured at a contact area of 15 mm x 50 mm, an adhesion time of 3 sec, and an<br>
adhesion and peeling rate of 500 mm/min, using a stainless plate as a body to be<br>
attached.<br>
[0057]<br>
(Tack strength (N/10 mm))<br>
A sample having a width of 25 mm was attached to a stainless plate, and the<br>
180° peel-off force of the sample was measured at a peeling rate: 300 mm/min.<br>
[0058]<br>
(Retentivity (minutes))<br>
The retentivity was measured according to JIS Z-1524.<br>
Namely, an adhesive tape was attached to a stainless plate so that an area of<br>
25 mm x 25 mm of the adhesive tape might contact the stainless plate, and a time<br>
until the adhesive tape slipped down was measured by applying 1 kg of load to the<br>
adhesive tape at 60°C.<br>
[0059]<br>
(Rate of change in melt viscosity (%))<br>
Using a Brookfield type viscometer, a rate of change in the melt viscosity<br>
below was determined when ?0 was the melt viscosity of the adhesive composition<br>
immediately after kneading at 180°C and ?1 was the melt viscosity at 180°C in 48<br>
hours after the adhesive composition was left as it was under a temperature<br>
atmosphere at 180°C. This was used as a scale for thermal stability.<br><br>
[0060]<br>
With respect to each of the melt viscosity, the loop tack, the tack strength, the<br>
retentivity, and the rate of change in melt viscosity, a decision criteria that it is<br>
practically good are shown below.<br>
The melt viscosity is not more than 3000 cP. When the melt viscosity<br>
exceedsthis value, processability deteriorates.<br>
The loop tack is not less than 4.0 N/15 mm. When the loop tack is less than<br>
this value, initial tackiness is inferior so that adhesion is difficult.<br>
The tack strength is not less than 5.0 N/10 mm. When the tack strength is<br>
less than this value, peel-off easily occurs.<br>
The retentivity is not less than 50 minutes. When the retentivity is less than<br>
this value, peel-off easily occurs for a shearing force.<br>
The rate of change in melt viscosity is -35 to +35%. Larger change than this<br>
makes stable coating impossible.<br>
[0062]<br>
As apparent from Table 2 above, it turned out that the adhesive<br>
compositions of Examples 1 to 7 containing 100 parts by mass of the<br>
predetermined hydrogenated block copolymer as Component (1) and 20 to<br>
400 parts by mass of the tackifier as Component (2) show good melt<br>
viscosity, loop tack, tack strength, and retentivity, and have a small rate of<br>
change in melt viscosity under high temperature heating and well-balanced<br>
adhesion properties.<br>
[0063]<br>
In Comparative Example 1, the melt viscosity was low and<br>
processability was good because Polymer 1 was a block copolymer not<br>
hydrogenated. On the other hand, the retentivity was remarkably reduced,<br>
and practically sufficient adhesiveness was not obtained.<br>
[0064]<br>
In Comparative Example 2, the peak molecular weight of the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer as Component (1-B) of Polymer 9 was too<br>
high. For this reason, the melt viscosity was high, the processability<br>
deteriorated, and a coating rate was slow. Then, coating at a high<br>
temperature was necessary in order to obtain the coating rate, the body to be<br>
attached might be damaged, and dealing in thin film formation was difficult.<br>
Moreover, aggregation of the hydrogenated block copolymer was excessively<br>
high so that the value of the loop tack was reduced. Accordingly, practically<br>
sufficient tackiness was not obtained, and adhesion was difficult.<br>
[0065]<br>
In Comparative Example 3, the hydrogenated block copolymer as<br>
Component (1-A) that constituted Polymer 10 was excessively more than the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer as Component (1-B). For this reason, the<br>
retentivity was remarkably reduced, and practically sufficient adhesiveness<br>
was not obtained.<br>
[0066]<br>
In Comparative Example 4, the peak molecular weight of the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer as Component (1-B) that constituted Polymer<br>
11 was low. For this reason, the retentivity was remarkably reduced, and<br>
practically sufficient adhesiveness was not obtained.<br>
[0067]<br>
In Comparative Example 5, the peak molecular weight of the<br>
hydrogenated block copolymer as Component (1-B) that constituted Polymer<br>
12 was low. For this reason, the tack strength was low, the retentivity was<br>
remarkably reduced, and practically sufficient tacky and adhesion properties<br>
were not obtained.<br>
[0068]<br>
In Comparative Example 6, the amount of the tackifier to be blended<br>
as Component (2) was excessively large. For this reason, the values of the<br>
loop tack and the retentivity were reduced, and practically sufficient tacky and<br>
adhesion properties were not obtained.<br>
[0069]<br>
In Comparative Example 7, the amount of the tackifier to be blended<br>
as Component (2) was excessively small. For this reason, the tack strength<br>
was remarkably reduced. Moreover, it turned out that in a heat stability test,<br>
a part of the hydrogenated copolymer was crosslinked to increase the<br>
viscosity so that the rate of change in melt viscosity was very high and the<br>
thermal stability was extremely inferior.<br>
[0070]<br>
