ROBERT BOSCH GMBH  70442 Stuttgart<br>
Electrical machine<br>
Prior art<br>
The invention relates to an electrical machine, in particular a generator of the generic type of the independent claim.<br>
A generator having an annular gap seal is known from WO 99/17430. A spacer is arranged between a pulley disk and a roller bearing in this case such that it forms an annular gap with a part which is attached to the hub. However, this annular gap has only a limited sealing effect. This annular gap seal can prevent only relatively large particles from being able to penetrate into the area between the spacer and the roller bearing. This limited sealing effect results in the disadvantage that this annular gap seal has no sealing effect   liquids or relatively small particles.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The electrical machine according to the invention and having the features of the independent claim makes it possible to design the annular gap seal such that it also has a sealing effect for liquids and relatively small particles. The improved annular gap seal thus additionally protects the roller bearing, which is already sealed by means of sealing disks, against the damaging influence of liquids. This is particularly advantageous when the vehicle having the electrical machine according to the invention needs to have what is referred to as a fording capability, and is thus<br><br>
also  intended  to  be  suitable  for  driving  through    <br>
The measures outlined in the dependent claims result in      " advantageous  developments  and  improvements  of  the features specified in the independent claim.<br>
Drawings<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following text using an exemplary embodiment and with reference to the associated drawings. Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through the electrical machine according to the invention, with the upper half of the figure showing the rotor of the machine, cut away, and the lower half of the figure showing a side view of the rotor; Figure 2 shows a section through an annular gap seal according to the invention.<br>
Identical or equivalent parts are annotated by the same reference numbers.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
The upper part of Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through the electrical machine according to the invention. The electrical machine, in this case in the form of a generator, has a pot-shaped housing 10, which is closed by a housing cover 14. A stator 18 is mounted within the pot-shaped housing 10, and surrounds a rotor 22. The rotor 22 is mounted at one end via a bearing 26 in the housing base 30, and at the other end via a roller bearing 34 in the housing cover 14 . The roller bearing 34 is in this case supported by a bearing ring 38 on the shaft side on a rotor shaft 42. On the hub side, the roller bearing 34 is supported in the housing cover 14 via a bearing ring 4 6 on the hub side. The housing cover 14 in this case, together with a shoulder 50, forms a hub 54. The axial position of the bearing<br><br>
ring 38 on the shaft side is bounded by a shaft collar 57, to which the bearing ring 38 on the shaft side is secured by means of a threaded nut 60 via a collar _^63 of a pulley disk 66 and a first component 69 which is arranged between the collar 63 and the bearing ring 38. The first component 69 is connected to the shaft 42 such that they are fixed in rotation. On the hub side, a covering cap 72 covers an electrical circuit 75, which is arranged radially outside the shoulder 50. A second component 78 is attached to the covering cap 72 and rests on the bearing ring 4 6 on the machine side. The covering cap 72 and the second component 78 are both connected to the housing cover 14, and hence to the hub 54, such that they are fixed in rotation. An annular gap 81 is formed between the shaft 42 and the first component 69, which is connected to the shaft 42 so that they are fixed in rotation, and to the second component 78 which is connected to the hub 54 such that they are fixed in rotation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Figure 2 shows the annular gap 81 and its immediate vicinity in more detail. As can clearly be seen, the annular gap 81 is at least partially filled with a pasty substance 84. This pasty substance 84 is, in particular, a grease. The annular gap 81 is at least partially U-shaped. The U-shaped region 87 of the annular gap 81 has free limb ends 90, 91, which point radially inward toward the shaft 42. The two free limb ends 90, 91 of the U-shaped region 87 are separated from one another by a collar 93 in the form of an annular disk. The collar 93 in the form of an annular disk is integrally formed on the first component 69, and in this case projects radially outward. The collar 93 in the form of an annular disk in this case runs .intro a~ cutout^") 96 in the hub 54 or in the second component 78, which is connected to the covering cap. The hub 54 is mounted by means of the roller bearing 34 such that it can rotate with respect to the shaft 42. The roller bearing 34 has a radially aligned sealing<br><br>
disk 99, which partially bounds the U-shaped region 87<br>
of the annular gap 81.  It is advantageous  for the<br>
collar 93 in the form of an annular disk to be formed<br>
on the first component 69 and, at the same time, for<br>
the first component 69 to be used as a spacer ring 102    joV<br>
for the bearing ring 38 on the shaft side of the roller   .&gt;-"<br>
bearing 34. It is likewise advantageous for the cutout<br>
96 to be arranged in the covering cap 72 formed by the<br>
second component 78.<br>
If the electrical machine illustrated in Figure 1 is driven via the pulley disk 66, then the collar 93 in the form of an annular disk rotates in the cutout 96 in the second component 78. If, as already described, the pasty substance 84, for example grease, is introduced into the annular disk 81, then the friction on the collar 93 in the form of an annular disk and the rotation speed of the collar 93 result in the pasty substance 84 being centrifuged radially outward. This results in the pasty substance 84 gathering in the U-shaped region 87, in particular in the external regions. Depending how much of the substance 84 is introduced into the annular gap 81, the U-shaped region 87 is filled to a greater or lesser extent. When filled to the maximum extent, both free limbs of the U-shaped region 87 are full. The Qonnection "^between the roller bearing 34 and the environment is thus closed with a seal. In order that the sealing effect of the filled annular gap 81 is maintained when subjected to water pressure, the pasty substance 84 must be chosen in such a manner that, firstly, it has good adhesion both to the second component 7 8 and to the first component 69 and, secondly, has a good internal composition. Good matching of these substance characteristics has the advantage that water pressing against the annular gap seal cannot penetrate behind the collar 93 in the form of an annular disk, on the bearing side, at least if the pressures are low.<br><br><br>
