CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/528,157, filed on December 9, 2003. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to vapor injection and, more<br>
particularly, to a heating or cooling system having an improved vapor injection<br>
system.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Heating and/or cooling systems including air-conditioning,<br>
chiller, refrigeration and heat pump systems may include a flash tank disposed<br>
between a heat exchanger and the compressor for use in improving system<br>
capacity and efficiency. The flash tank is operable to receive a stream of liquid<br>
refrigerant from a heat exchanger and convert a portion of the liquid refrigerant<br>
into vapor for use by the compressor. Because the flash tank is held at a lower<br>
pressure relative to the inlet liquid refrigerant, some of the liquid refrigerant<br>
vaporizes, causing the remaining liquid refrigerant in the flash tank to lose heat<br>
and become sub-cooled and increasing the pressure of the vaporized refrigerant<br>
in the flash tank. Flash tanks contain both vaporized refrigerant and sub-cooled-<br>
liquid refrigerant.<br>
[0004] The vaporized refrigerant from the flash tank is distributed to a<br>
medium or intermediate pressure input of the compressor, whereby the<br>
vaporized refrigerant is at a substantially higher pressure than vaporized<br>
refrigerant leaving the evaporator, but at a lower pressure than an exit stream of<br>
refrigerant leaving the compressor. The pressurized refrigerant from the flash<br>
tank allows the compressor to compress this pressurized refrigerant to its normal<br>
output pressure while passing it through only a portion of the compressor.<br>
[0005] The sub-cooled refrigerant disposed in the flash tank is operable<br>
to increase the capacity and efficiency of the heat exchanger. Specifically, the<br>
sub-cooled liquid is discharged from the flash tank and is sent to one of the heat<br>
exchangers depending on the desired mode (i.e., heating or cooling). Because<br>
the liquid is in a sub-cooled state, more heat can be absorbed from the<br>
surroundings by the heat exchanger. In this manner, the overall performance of<br>
the heating or cooling cycle is improved.<br>
[0006] The flow of pressurized refrigerant from the flash tank to the<br>
compressor is regulated to ensure that only vaporized refrigerant is received by<br>
the compressor. Similarly, flow of sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant from the flash<br>
tank to the heat exchanger is regulated to inhibit flow of vaporized refrigerant<br>
from the flash tank to the heat exchanger. Both of the foregoing situations may<br>
be controlled by regulating the flow of liquid refrigerant into the flash tank. In<br>
other words, by regulating the flow of liquid refrigerant into the flash tank, the<br>
amount of vaporized refrigerant and sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant may be<br>
controlled, thereby controlling flow of vaporized refrigerant to the compressor and<br>
sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant to the heat exchanger.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0020] Vapor injection may be used in air-conditioning, chiller,<br>
refrigeration and heat pump systems to improve system capacity and efficiency.<br>
Vapor injection systems may include a flash tank for vaporizing refrigerant<br>
supplied to a compressor and sub-cooling refrigerant supplied to a heat<br>
exchanger. Vapor injection may be used in heat pump systems, which are<br>
capable of providing both heating and cooling to commercial and residential<br>
buildings, to improve one or both of heating and cooling capacity and efficiency.<br>
For the same reasons, flash tanks may be used in chiller applications to provide<br>
a cooling effect for water, in refrigeration systems to cool an interior space of a<br>
display case or refrigerator, and in air-conditioning systems to effect the<br>
temperature of a room or building. While heat pump systems may include a<br>
cooling cycle and a heating cycle, chiller, refrigeration and air-conditioning<br>
systems often only include a cooling cycle. However, heat pump chillers which<br>
provide a heating and cooling cycle are the norm in some parts of the world.<br>
Each system uses a refrigerant to generate the desired cooling or heating effect<br>
through a refrigeration cycle.<br>
[0021] For air-conditioning applications, the refrigeration cycle is used<br>
to lower the temperature of the new space to be cooled, typically a room or<br>
building. For this application, a fan or blower is typically used to force the<br>
ambient air into more rapid contact with the evaporator to increase heat transfer<br>
and cool the surroundings.<br>
[0022] For chiller applications, the refrigeration cycle cools or chills a<br>
stream of water. Heat pump chillers use the refrigeration cycle to heat a stream<br>
of water when operating on HEAT mode. Rather than using a fan or blower, the<br>
refrigerant remains on one side of the heat exchanger while circulating water or<br>
brine provides the heat source for evaporation. Heat pump chillers often use<br>
ambient air as the heat source for evaporation during HEAT mode but may also<br>
use other sources such as ground water or a heat exchanger that absorbs heat<br>
from the earth. Thus, the heat exchanger cools or heats the water passing<br>
therethrough as heat is transferred from the water into the refrigerant on COOL<br>
mode and from the refrigerant into the water on HEAT mode.<br>
[0023] In a refrigeration system, such as a refrigerator or refrigerated<br>
display case, the heat exchanger cools an interior space of the device and a<br>
condenser rejects the absorbed heat. A fan or blower is often used to force the<br>
air in the interior space of the device into more rapid contact with the evaporator<br>
to increase heat transfer and cool the interior space.<br>
[0024] In a heat pump system, the refrigeration cycle is used to both<br>
heat and cool. A heat pump system may include an indoor unit and an outdoor<br>
unit, and the indoor unit is operable to both heat and cool a room or an interior<br>
space of a commercial or residential building. The heat pump may also be of a<br>
monobloc construction with the "outdoor" and "indoor" parts combined in one<br>
frame.<br>
[0025] As described previously, the refrigeration cycle is applicable to<br>
air conditioning, chiller, heat pump chiller, refrigeration and heat pump systems.<br>
While each system has unique features, vapor injection may be used to improve<br>
system capacity and efficiency. That is, in each system, a flash tank receiving a<br>
stream of liquid refrigerant from a heat exchanger and converting a portion of the<br>
liquid refrigerant into vapor, may be supplied to a medium or intermediate<br>
pressure input of the compressor, whereby the vaporized refrigerant is at a<br>
higher pressure than vaporized refrigerant leaving the evaporator, but at a lower<br>
pressure than an exit stream of refrigerant leaving the compressor. The<br>
pressurized refrigerant from the flash tank, therefore, allows the compressor to<br>
compress this pressurized refrigerant to its normal output pressure while passing<br>
it through only a portion of the compressor. Further, the sub-cooled refrigerant in<br>
the flash tank is useful to increase the capacity and efficiency of the heat<br>
exchanger. Because the liquid discharged from the flash tank is sub-cooled,<br>
when supplied to the heat exchanger, more heat can be absorbed from the<br>
surroundings, increasing overall performance of the heating or cooling cycle.<br>
More specific examples will be provided next with reference to the drawings, but<br>
one of skill in the art should recognize that while the examples described in this<br>
application include air conditioning, the teachings are applicable to other systems<br>
and certain features described with respect to a particular type of system may be<br>
equally applicable to other types of systems.<br>
[0026] In the following paragraphs, heat pump systems with vapor<br>
injection according to the teachings will be particularly described, followed by<br>
cooling systems with vapor injection according to the invention. The latter<br>
description is more specifically suited to air-conditioning, chiller and refrigeration<br>
systems.<br>
[0027] With reference to FIGS. 1-7, a heat pump system 22 is provided<br>
and includes an outdoor unit 24, an indoor unit 26, a scroll compressor 28, an<br>
accumulator tank 30, and a vapor injection system 32. The indoor and outdoor<br>
units 24, 26 are in fluid communication with the scroll compressor 28,<br>
accumulator tank 30, and vapor injection system 32 such that a refrigerant may<br>
circulate therebetween. The refrigerant cycles through the system 22 under<br>
pressure from the scroll compressor 28 and circulates between the indoor and<br>
outdoor units 24, 26 to reject and absorb heat. As can be appreciated, whether<br>
the indoor or outdoor unit 24, 26 rejects or accepts heat will depend on whether<br>
the heat pump system 22 is set to COOL or HEAT, as will be discussed further<br>
below.<br>
[0028] The outdoor unit 24 includes an outdoor coil or heat exchanger<br>
34 and an outdoor fan 36 driven by a motor 37. The outdoor unit 24 includes a<br>
protective housing that encases the outdoor coil 34 and outdoor fan 36 so that<br>
the fan 36 will draw ambient outdoor air across the outdoor coil 34 to improve<br>
heat transfer. In addition, the outdoor unit 24 usually houses the scroll<br>
compressor 28 and accumulator tank 30. While outdoor unit 24 has been<br>
described as including a fan 40 to draw ambient air across the coil 34, it should<br>
be understood that any method of transferring heat from the coil 34, such as<br>
burying the coil 34 below ground or passing a stream of water around the coil 34,<br>
is considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0029] The indoor unit 26 includes an indoor coil or heat exchanger 38<br>
and an indoor fan 40 driven by a motor 41, which may be a single-speed, two-<br>
speed, or variable-speed motor. The indoor fan 40 and coil 38 are enclosed in a<br>
cabinet so that the fan 40 forces ambient indoor air across the indoor coil 38 at a<br>
rate determined by the speed of the variable speed motor. As can be<br>
appreciated, such air flow across the coil 38 causes heat transfer between the<br>
ambient indoor surroundings and the indoor coil 38. In this regard, the indoor coil<br>
38, in conjunction with the indoor fan 40, is operable to selectively raise or lower<br>
the temperature of the indoor surroundings. Again, while a fan 40 is disclosed, it<br>
should be understood that in a chiller application, heat is transferred from a<br>
stream of water directly to the refrigerant and, as such, may obviate the need for<br>
the fan 40.<br>
[0030] The heat pump system 22 is designated for both cooling and<br>
heating by simply reversing the function of the indoor coil 38 and the outdoor coil<br>
34 via a four-way reversing valve 42. Specifically, when the four-way valve 42 is<br>
set to the COOL position, the indoor coil 38 functions as an evaporator coil and<br>
the outdoor coil 34 functions as a condenser coil. Conversely, when the four-way<br>
valve 42 is switched to the HEAT position (the alternate position), the function of<br>
the coils 34, 38 is reversed, i.e., the indoor coil 38 functions as the condenser<br>
and the outdoor coil 34 functions as the evaporator. When the indoor coil 38 acts<br>
as an evaporator, heat from the ambient-indoor surroundings is absorbed by the<br>
liquid refrigerant moving through the indoor coil 34. Such heat transfer between<br>
the indoor coil 38 and the liquid refrigerant cools the surrounding indoor air.<br>
Conversely, when the indoor coil 38 acts as a condenser, heat from the<br>
vaporized refrigerant is rejected by the indoor coil 38, thereby heating the<br>
surrounding indoor air.<br>
[0031] The scroll compressor 28 is housed within the outdoor unit 26<br>
and is operable to pressurize the heat pump system 22 such that refrigerant is<br>
circulated throughout the system 22. The scroll compressor 28 includes a<br>
suction side having a suction port 44, a discharge port 46, and a vapor injection<br>
port 48. The discharge port 46 is fluidly connected to the four-way valve 42 by a<br>
conduit 50 such that a pressurized stream of refrigerant may be distributed to the<br>
outdoor and indoor units 24, 26 via four-way valve 42. The suction port 44 is<br>
fluidly coupled to the accumulator tank 30 via conduit 52 such that the scroll<br>
compressor 28 draws a stream of refrigerant from the accumulator tank 30 for<br>
compression.<br>
[0032] The scroll compressor 28 receives refrigerant at the suction port<br>
44 from the accumulator tank 30, which is fluidly connected to the four-way valve<br>
42 via conduit 54 and operable to receive a flow of refrigerant from the outdoor<br>
and indoor units 24, 26 for compression by the scroll compressor 28. The<br>
accumulator tank 30 serves to store low-pressure refrigerant received from the<br>
outdoor and indoor coils 24, 26 and to protect the compressor 28 from the<br>
possibility of refrigerant returning in a liquid state prior to compression.<br>
[0033] The vapor injection port 48 is fluidly coupled to the vapor<br>
injection system 32 via conduit 54, which may include a solenoid valve (not<br>
shown), and receives a flow of pressurized refrigerant from the vapor injection<br>
system 32. Specifically, the vapor injection system 32 produces a stream of<br>
pressurized vapor at a higher-pressure level than that supplied by the<br>
accumulator tank 30, but at a lower pressure than produced by the scroll<br>
compressor 28. After the pressurized vapor reaches a heightened pressure<br>
level, the vapor injection system 32 delivers the pressurized refrigerant to the<br>
scroll compressor 28 via vapor injection port 48. By delivering pressurized-vapor<br>
refrigerant to the scroll compressor 28, heating and cooling capacity and<br>
efficiency of the system 22 may be improved. As can be appreciated, such an<br>
increase in efficiency may be even more pronounced when the difference<br>
between the outdoor temperature and the desired indoor temperature is relatively<br>
large (i.e., during hot or cold weather).<br>
[0034] With reference to FIGS 1 and 9-11, the vapor injection system<br>
32 is shown to include a flash tank 56 and a solenoid valve 58. The flash tank 56<br>
includes an inlet port 60, a vapor outlet 62, and a sub-cooled-liquid outlet 64,<br>
each fluidly coupled to an interior volume 66. The inlet port 60 is fluidly coupled<br>
to the outdoor and indoor units 24, 26 via conduits 68, 70, as best shown in FIG.<br>
1. The vapor injection port 62 is fluidly coupled to the vapor injection port 48 of<br>
the scroll compressor 28 via conduit 54 while the sub-cooled-liquid outlet port 64<br>
is fluidly coupled to the outdoor and indoor units 24, 26 via conduits 72, 70.<br>
[0035] When the heat pump system 22 is set to COOL, the scroll<br>
compressor 28 imparts a suction force on the accumulator tank 30 to thereby<br>
draw a stream of vaporized refrigerant into the scroll compressor 28. Once the<br>
vapor is sufficiently pressurized, the high-pressure refrigerant is discharged from<br>
the scroll compressor 28 via discharge port 46 and conduit 50. The four-way<br>
valve 42 directs the pressurized refrigerant to the outdoor unit 24 via conduit 74.<br>
Upon reaching the outdoor coil 34, the refrigerant releases stored heat due to the<br>
interaction between the outside air, the coil 34, and the pressure imparted by the<br>
scroll compressor 28. As can be appreciated, after the refrigerant has released a<br>
sufficient amount of heat, the refrigerant will change phase from a gaseous or<br>
vaporized phase to a liquid phase.<br>
[0036] After the refrigerant has changed phase from gas to liquid, the<br>
refrigerant will move from the outdoor coil 34 to the indoor coil 38 via conduit 70.<br>
An expansion device 76 disposed between the outdoor unit 24 and the indoor<br>
unit 26 serves to lower the pressure of the liquid refrigerant. The expansion<br>
device 76 may be a capillary tube that acts to expand the liquid refrigerant due to<br>
the interaction between the moving liquid refrigerant and inner walls of the<br>
capillary tube 76. In this manner, the liquid refrigerant is expanded prior to<br>
reaching the indoor unit 26 and begins to transition back to the gaseous phase.<br>
It should be noted that when the system 22 is set to COOL, the solenoid valve 58<br>
is typically closed such that flow is restricted from entering the flash tank 56.<br>
[0037] Upon reaching the indoor unit 26, the liquid refrigerant will enter<br>
the indoor coil 38 to complete the transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous<br>
phase. The liquid refrigerant enters the indoor coil 38 at a low pressure (due to<br>
the interaction of the capillary tube 76, as previously discussed) and is operable<br>
to absorb heat from the surroundings. As the fan 40 passes air through the coil<br>
38, the refrigerant absorbs the heat and completes the phase change, thereby<br>
cooling the air passing through the indoor coil 38 and, thus, cooling the<br>
surroundings. Once the refrigerant reaches the end of the indoor coil 38, the<br>
refrigerant is in a low-pressure gaseous state. At this point, the suction from the<br>
scroll compressor 28 causes the refrigerant to return to the accumulator tank 30<br>
via conduit 78 and four-way valve 42.<br>
[0038] When the heat pump system 22 is set to HEAT, the scroll<br>
compressor 28 imparts a suction force on the accumulator tank 30 to thereby<br>
draw a stream of vaporized refrigerant into the scroll compressor 28. Once the<br>
vapor is sufficiently pressurized, the high-pressure refrigerant is discharged from<br>
the scroll compressor 28 via discharge port 46 and conduit 50. The four-way<br>
valve 42 directs the pressurized refrigerant to the indoor unit 26 via conduit 78.<br>
Upon reaching the indoor coil 38, the refrigerant releases stored heat due to the<br>
interaction between the inside air, the coil 38, and the pressure imparted by the<br>
scroll compressor 28 and, as such, heats the surrounding area. As can be<br>
appreciated, once the refrigerant has released a sufficient amount of heat, the<br>
refrigerant will change phase from the gaseous or vaporized phase to a liquid<br>
phase.<br>
[0039] Once the refrigerant has changed phase from gas to liquid, the<br>
refrigerant will move from the indoor coil 38 to the outdoor coil 34 via conduits 70<br>
and 68. More particularly, the liquid refrigerant first travels along conduit 70 until<br>
reaching a check valve 80. The check valve 80 restricts further movement of the<br>
liquid refrigerant along conduit 70 from the indoor coil 26 to the outdoor coil 24.<br>
In doing so, the check valve 80 causes the liquid refrigerant to flow into conduit<br>
68 and encounter the solenoid valve 58.<br>
[0040] The solenoid valve 58 is toggled into an open position when the<br>
four-way valve 42 is set to the HEAT position to allow the flow of liquid refrigerant<br>
to reach the outdoor unit 24 via the vapor injection system 32. As the solenoid<br>
valve 58 is in the open position, the liquid refrigerant is permitted to enter the<br>
flash tank 56 via inlet port 60. As the liquid refrigerant flows through the inlet port<br>
60, the interior volume 66 of the flash tank 56 begins to fill. The entering liquid<br>
refrigerant causes the fixed interior volume 66 to become pressurized as the<br>
volume of the tank is filled. The solenoid valve 58 is operable to be selectively<br>
opened and closed when the system is set to either HEAT or COOL to selectively<br>
restrict and permit refrigerant from entering the flash tank 56. Opening and<br>
closing of the solenoid valve 58 is largely dependent upon system conditions and<br>
compressor requirements, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0041] Once the liquid refrigerant reaches the flash tank 56, the liquid<br>
releases heat, thereby causing some of the liquid refrigerant to vaporize and<br>
some of the liquid to enter a sub-cooled-liquid state. At this point, the flash tank<br>
56 has a mixture of both vaporized refrigerant and sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant,<br>
whereby the vaporized refrigerant is at a higher pressure than that of the<br>
vaporized refrigerant leaving the coils 34, 38 but at a higher pressure than the<br>
vaporized refrigerant leaving the discharge port 46 of the scroll compressor 28.<br>
[0042] The vaporized refrigerant exits the flash tank 56 via the vapor<br>
injection port 62 and is fed into the vapor injection port 48 of the scroll<br>
compressor 28. The pressurized vapor-refrigerant allows the scroll compressor<br>
28 to deliver an outlet refrigerant stream with a desired output pressure, thereby<br>
improving the overall efficiency of the system 22, as previously discussed.<br>
[0043] The sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant exits the flash tank 56 via port<br>
64 and reaches the outdoor unit 24 via conduits 72, 70. The sub-cooled-liquid<br>
refrigerant leaves port 64 and encounters an expansion device 82 such as a<br>
capillary tube, which is adapted to expand the liquid refrigerant prior to reaching<br>
the outdoor coil 34 in an effort to improve the ability of the refrigerant to extract<br>
heat from the outside. Once the refrigerant absorbs heat from the outside via<br>
outdoor coil 34, the refrigerant will once again return to the gaseous stage and<br>
return to the accumulator tank 30 via conduit 74 and four-way valve 42 to begin<br>
the cycle again. System 22 further includes a check valve 84, which is generally<br>
disposed on conduit 72 between conduit 70 and sub-cooled-liquid port 64 and<br>
prevents refrigerant from entering the flash tank 56 via discharge port 64 when<br>
the refrigerant is moving through conduit 70 from either the outdoor or indoor<br>
units 24, 26.<br>
[0044] With particular reference to FIGS. 9-11, an expansion device 86<br>
is further provided to control the amount of vaporized refrigerant in the flash tank<br>
56, and subsequently the amount of vaporized refrigerant reaching the vapor<br>
injection port 48 of the scroll compressor 28. The expansion device 86 includes<br>
a buoyant member 88, an outwardly extending arm 90, a needle 92, and a<br>
needle housing 94. The buoyant member 88 is fixedly attached to, and<br>
supported by, the outwardly extending arm 90, as best shown in FIG. 11. The<br>
buoyant member 88 is adapted to float on the liquid refrigerant disposed within<br>
the interior volume 66 of the flash tank 56, thereby indicating a liquid level of<br>
refrigerant in the flash tank 56.<br>
[0045] The outwardly extending arm 90 is fixedly attached to the<br>
buoyant member 88 at a first end and pivotably supported by the needle housing<br>
94 at a second end. In this manner, as the buoyant member 88 moves in an<br>
axial direction, due to changing levels of liquid refrigerant in the flash tank 56, the<br>
second end of the outwardly extending arm 90 will pivot relative to the needle<br>
housing 94. Such pivotal movement of the outwardly extending arm 90 causes<br>
concurrent movement of the needle 92 relative to the needle housing 94, due to<br>
the relationship between the needle 92 and the arm 90, as will be discussed<br>
further below.<br>
[0046] The second end of the arm 90 is pivotably supported by the<br>
needle housing 92 by a pivot 96, whereby the pivot 96 is rotatably received<br>
through an aperture 91 of the arm 90 and fixedly to the housing 94 at an aperture<br>
94. In this regard, movement of the buoyant member 88 rotates the arm 90<br>
relative to the housing 94 about pivot 96. In addition, a pin 98 is fixedly attached<br>
to the needle 92 via aperture 95 and slidably received by a slot 100 of the arm 90<br>
such that as the arm 90 rotates about pivot 96, the pin 98 translates within slot<br>
100. Such movement of the pin 98 within slot 100 causes concurrent axial<br>
movement of the needle 92 relative to the needle housing 94 as the needle 92 is<br>
fixedly attached to the pin 98.<br>
[0047] The needle 92 is slidably received by a bore 102 formed in the<br>
needle housing 94 such that movement of the pin 98 along slot 100 causes<br>
concurrent movement of the needle 92 within the bore 102. The needle 92<br>
includes a tapered surface 104 adapted to selectively engage the inlet port 60 to<br>
selectively open and close the inlet 60. The tapered surface 104 engages the<br>
inlet 60 in a fully closed position and retracts from engagement with the inlet 60<br>
allow liquid refrigerant to enter the flash tank 56.<br>
[0048] The tapered surface 104 allows the needle 92 to provide a<br>
plurality of open positions depending on the position of the buoyant member 88<br>
within the interior volume 66. For example, if the position of the buoyant member<br>
88 is in a desired position (such that a desired amount of liquid refrigerant is<br>
disposed within the flash tank 56) the tapered surface 104 will engage the inlet<br>
60 to restrict refrigerant from entering the flash tank 56. If there is insufficient<br>
liquid refrigerant disposed within the interior volume 66 of the flash tank 56, the<br>
buoyant member 88 will drop, thereby causing the arm 90 to pivot.<br>
[0049] Pivotal movement of the arm 90 causes axial movement of the<br>
needle 92 relative to the needle housing 94 due to the interaction of the pin 98,<br>
slot 100, and needle 92, as previously discussed. Such movement of the pin 92<br>
within bore 102 causes the tapered surface 104 to disengage the inlet 60 and<br>
allow liquid refrigerant to enter the flash tank 56. As can be appreciated, the<br>
more the buoyant member 88 drops, the more the arm 90 will move the needle<br>
92 away from the inlet 60. As the needle 92 moves farther from the inlet 60,<br>
more liquid refrigerant is allowed to enter the flash tank 56 due to the tapered<br>
surface 104 which, as it moves away from the inlet 60, more liquid refrigerant is<br>
allowed to pass through the inlet 60 and around the tapered surface 104. In this<br>
manner, the needle 92 is operable to control the amount of liquid refrigerant<br>
within the flash tank 56 due to the relationship between the buoyant member 88,<br>
arm 90, and tapered surface 104.<br>
[0050] The vapor injection system 32 is operable to control circulation<br>
of the refrigerant within the system 22 as movement of the refrigerant from the<br>
indoor unit 26 to the outdoor unit 24 is effectively controlled by the amount of<br>
vaporized refrigerant drawn into the vapor injection port 48 of the scroll<br>
compressor 28 and the amount of sub-cooled liquid flowing to the evaporator 34<br>
via port 64. The vapor injection system 32 will only allow liquid refrigerant to<br>
enter the flash tank 56 when sufficient vapor has been extracted from the interior<br>
volume 66 and sufficient sub-cooled liquid has exited via port 64. Additional<br>
liquid refrigerant may be needed in the flash tank 56 to backfill vapor exiting<br>
through port 62 when the scroll compressor 28 has drawn vaporized refrigerant<br>
out of the flash tank 56 and sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant has discharged through<br>
port 64. In this manner, the vapor injection system 32 is operable to control<br>
refrigerant flow when the four-way valve 42 is in the HEAT position.<br>
[0051] With reference to FIG. 2, a heat pump system 22a is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump system 22 described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0052] The heat pump system 22a includes a vapor injection system<br>
32a, which has an electronic expansion valve 107 in place of the solenoid valve<br>
58. The system 22a functions similarly to the system described above with<br>
respect to refrigerant flow in both the COOL and HEAT modes. The electronic<br>
expansion valve 107 provides the system 22a with the ability to further control<br>
the flow of fluid refrigerant into the flash tank 56 by selectively restricting and<br>
permitting varying amounts of refrigerant into the flash tank 56 in response to<br>
sensed system parameters such as, but not limited to, liquid refrigerant reaching<br>
the scroll compressor 28 or refrigerant not fully condensing or evaporating in the<br>
coils 34, 38 (depending on the position of the four-way valve 42 in either HEAT or<br>
COOL). Any of the foregoing conditions may indicate that the system 22a is not<br>
operating at optimum efficiency. In this manner, the electronic expansion valve<br>
107 is operable to control refrigerant flow into the flash tank 56 in an effort to<br>
balance refrigerant flow and optimize the capacity and efficiency of the system<br>
22a. The expansion device 86 (see Fig 1) may be rendered unnecessary by the<br>
electronic expansion valve 107.<br>
[0053] With reference to FIG. 3, a heat pump system 22b is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump systems described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0054] The heat pump system 22b does not include a solenoid valve<br>
58, electronic expansion valve 107, nor expansion device 86 to regulate flow into<br>
the flash tank 56. Rather, a pair of capillary tubes 110 and 120 control flow into<br>
the tank 56, while flow from the tank 56 to the heat exchangers 34, 38 is<br>
controlled by a pair of capillary tubes 82 and 116, depending on the mode of<br>
operation (i.e., HEAT or COOL). In addition, check valves 84, 108, 112 and 118<br>
guide flow in the correct direction when the system is switched from HEAT to<br>
COOL and from COOL to HEAT, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0055] In the COOL mode, liquid refrigerant flows from the outdoor unit<br>
26 along conduit 70 generally towards the indoor unit 26, as previously<br>
discussed. In doing so, the flow is directed to the inlet 60 of flash tank 56 via<br>
conduit 111, whereby conduit 111 includes check valve 108 and capillary tube<br>
110. It should be noted that the flow is further directed toward the flash tank 56,<br>
and restricted from reaching the indoor unit 26, by check valve 112. In this<br>
manner, the capillary tube 110 and check valves 108, 112, are operable to direct<br>
the liquid refrigerant from the outdoor unit 24 and into the flash tank 56 for<br>
vaporization and sub-cooling. In this regard, the overall flow of refrigerant is<br>
controlled by the capillary tubes 82, 116 and check valves 84, 108,112 and 118.<br>
[0056] Once the refrigerant is vaporized and discharged to the scroll<br>
compressor 28, the sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant is discharged through port 64<br>
and sent to the indoor unit 26 via a discharge conduit 114. Discharge conduit<br>
114 is fluidly coupled to conduit 72 and includes capillary tube 116 and check<br>
valve 118. The check valve 118 is operable to direct the flow generally towards<br>
the indoor unit 26 and to prevent refrigerant from traveling towards the flash tank<br>
56 along conduits 114 and 72, while the capillary tube 116 provides the indoor<br>
unit 26 with a partially expanded refrigerant stream for use in cooling the indoor<br>
space.<br>
[0057] In the HEAT mode, the liquid refrigerant is received from the<br>
indoor unit 26 and is sent to the flash tank 56 via conduit 111 and check valve<br>
112. In addition, capillary tube 120 is generally positioned between the indoor<br>
unit 26 and the flash tank 56 to partially expand the liquid refrigerant prior to<br>
entrance into the flash tank 56. In the HEAT mode, check valve 108 restricts<br>
refrigerant flow from the indoor unit 26 to the outdoor unit 24 and directs the flow<br>
into the flash tank 56. In this regard, the vapor injection system 32b is operable<br>
to control refrigerant flow throughout the system 22. Once the refrigerant<br>
reaches the flash tank 56 and is sufficiently vaporized, the vapor is sent to the<br>
scroll compressor 28 and the sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant is sent to the outdoor<br>
unit 24 via conduits 72 and 70, as previously discussed.<br>
[0058] FIG. 4 depicts a "HEAT ONLY" condition, whereby refrigerant<br>
reaches the flash tank 56 when the four-way valve 42 is set to HEAT. In such a<br>
condition, liquid refrigerant is received by the flash tank 56 through inlet 60 via<br>
conduit 70 and solenoid valve 58. Specifically, solenoid valve 58 is set to an<br>
open position when the four-way valve 42 is set on the HEAT mode to allow fluid<br>
flow into the flash tank 56. In this manner, the solenoid valve 58, in response to<br>
the setting of the four-way valve 42 (i.e., HEAT mode versus COOL mode),<br>
selectively permits and restricts refrigerant flow into the flash tank 56. While a<br>
solenoid valve 58 is disclosed, it should be understood that any other suitable<br>
valve, such as an electronic expansion valve 107, is anticipated, and should be<br>
considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0059] When the four-way valve 42 is set to COOL, the refrigerant<br>
travels from the outdoor coil 34 along conduits 70, 114 prior to reaching the<br>
indoor coil 36. Conduit 114 is fluidly coupled to conduit 70 and includes check<br>
valve 118 to prevent flow along conduit 114 when the four-way valve 42 is set to<br>
HEAT. During the COOL mode, the solenoid valve 58 is in a closed position<br>
such that refrigerant is prevented from entering the vapor injection system 32b.<br>
[0060] In addition, a bypass 113 having an expansion device 115 (such<br>
as a capillary tube) and a check valve 119 are also provided adjacent to indoor<br>
coil 38. While the expansion device 115 and check valve 119 are described as<br>
being adjacent to the indoor coil 38, it should be understood that they may<br>
alternatively be located in the outdoor unit 24. The expansion device 115<br>
operates on COOL to expand the refrigerant prior to reaching the coil 38 and will<br>
be bypassed by the check valve 119 during HEAT.<br>
[0061] With reference to FIG. 5, a heat pump system 22b is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump systems described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0062] The heat pump system 22b includes a control system operable<br>
to selectively permit and restrict refrigerant flow into the vapor injection system<br>
32b. The control system includes a pair of solenoid valves 122, 124 operable to<br>
control refrigerant flow by selectively permitting and restricting flow through<br>
conduits 70, 111, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0063] In the COOL mode, liquid refrigerant is received from the<br>
outdoor unit 24 via conduit 70. The liquid refrigerant is directed to the flash tank<br>
56 via conduit 111 and to the indoor unit 26 via conduit 70. Solenoid valve 122 is<br>
disposed between the outdoor and indoor units 24, 26 and is operable to restrict<br>
and permit refrigerant flow therebetween. Solenoid valve 124 is disposed<br>
between the outdoor unit 24 and the flash tank 56 and similarly serves to<br>
selectively restrict and permit refrigerant flow. In operation, when solenoid valve<br>
122 restricts flow, refrigerant from the outdoor unit 24 is directed via conduit 111<br>
into the flash tank 56 where it is vaporized and circulated as vapor back to the<br>
scroll compressor 28 and as sub-cooled refrigerant to the indoor unit 38. When<br>
solenoid valve 122 is open, refrigerant from the outdoor unit 24 is directed toward<br>
the indoor unit 26, thereby bypassing the vapor injection system 32b.<br>
[0064] The control system is operable to selectively open and close<br>
valves 122, 124 depending on system conditions. Specifically, if more vaporized<br>
refrigerant is needed in the scroll compressor 28, solenoid valve 122 is closed,<br>
thereby directing more liquid refrigerant into the flash tank 56. On the other<br>
hand, if the system control so demands, the solenoid valve 107 is closed to<br>
restrict flow into the flash tank 56, thereby directing the liquid refrigerant from the<br>
outdoor unit 24 to the indoor unit 26 via conduit 70. In this manner, the solenoid<br>
valves 107, 122, 124 cooperate to cause the refrigerant to selectively bypass the<br>
vapor injection system 32b in response to system conditions and parameters. As<br>
can be appreciated, when the solenoid valve 107 restricts flow into the flash tank<br>
56, the control system is operable to open solenoid valve 122 and permit flow to<br>
the indoor unit 26. In other words, the control system balances the flow of<br>
vaporized refrigerant to the scroll compressor 28, sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant to<br>
the indoor unit 26, and liquid refrigerant to the indoor unit 26 by selectively<br>
opening and closing solenoid valves 107, 122,124.<br>
[0065] In the HEAT mode, liquid refrigerant is received from the indoor<br>
unit 26 and flows to the flash tank 56 via conduit 111 and check valve 112.<br>
When the flash tank is not required for optimum capacity and efficiency, however,<br>
the control system is operable to restrict further flow into the tank 56 by closing<br>
solenoid valve 107. In such a situation, the refrigerant is directed toward the<br>
outdoor unit 26 via conduit 126. Conduit 126 includes a capillary tube 128 and<br>
fluidly couples conduit 111 and conduit 70 such that refrigerant may be directly<br>
sent from the indoor unit 26 to the outdoor unit 24 in a partially vaporized<br>
condition, as best shown in FIG. 5.<br>
[0066] When the flash tank 56 requires further refrigerant, the control<br>
system is operable to close solenoid valve 124 disposed on conduit 126 in an<br>
effort to direct flow to the flash tank 56. In other words, the control system may<br>
restrict flow to the outdoor unit 24 by selectively closing solenoid valve 124 to<br>
direct flow from the indoor unit 26 to the flash tank 56 via conduit 111. In either<br>
of the foregoing situations, solenoid valve 122 is closed so as to direct flow either<br>
to conduit 111 or conduit 126, and therefore selectively allow and block flow in<br>
both directions (i.e., between the outdoor and indoor units 24, 26). While a<br>
solenoid valve 122 is disclosed, it should be understood that an electronic<br>
expansion valve (EXV) could be used in place of the solenoid valve 122, or could<br>
replace capillary tube 128 and solenoid valve 124, and is considered within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0067] In either of the foregoing HEAT and COOL modes, it should be<br>
understood that the vapor injection system 32b may be selectively bypassed<br>
such that the system 32b is only utilized under one of the HEATING or COOLING<br>
modes. More particularly, by closing solenoid valve 107 when the four-way valve<br>
42 is set to HEAT, refrigeration cycling between the coils 34, 36 will bypass the<br>
vapor injection system 32b altogether. Similarly, by closing solenoid valve 107<br>
when the four-way valve 42 is set to COOL, refrigeration cycling between the<br>
coils 34, 36 will bypass the vapor injection system 32b. In this manner, the vapor<br>
injection system 32b may be selectively used during either COOLING or<br>
HEATING, depending on the particular application and system requirements.<br>
[0068] With reference to FIG. 6, a heat pump system 22c is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump systems described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0069] Heat pump system 22c allows for vapor injection on both a<br>
HEAT and a COOL mode by adding an additional valve to control flow from<br>
vapor injection system 32c to the compressor 28. Specifically, a solenoid valve<br>
58 is added to vapor line 54 such that vapor from the flash tank 56 is selectively<br>
restricted from reaching the compressor 28 through selective opening and<br>
closing of valve 58. Valve 58 controls vapor into the compressor 28 during each<br>
of the COOL and HEAT modes, and thus regulates a flow from the flash tank 56.<br>
[0070] With reference to FIG. 7, a heat pump system 22d is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump systems described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0071] The heat pump system 22d includes a vapor injection system 32d<br>
having a plate heat exchanger 132 and a series of control valves 134, 136, 138.<br>
The plate heat exchanger 132 is operable to vaporize liquid refrigerant and to<br>
distribute such vaporized refrigerant to the scroll compressor 28 to improve the<br>
overall efficiency of the compressor 28 and heat pump system 22d. The control<br>
valves 134,136, 138 serve to control liquid refrigerant into the plate heat exchanger<br>
132, thereby controlling refrigerant flow through the system 22d, as will be<br>
discussed further below.<br>
[0072] The first control valve 134 is disposed proximate an outlet of the<br>
outdoor coil 34 and may selectively restrict flow into the coil 34, as will be described<br>
further below. In addition, a bypass 140 and check valve 142 are provided to allow<br>
flow from the outdoor unit 24 regardless of the position of control valve 134 (i.e.,<br>
open or closed). In the COOL mode, the first control valve 134 is in the closed<br>
position such that liquid flows to the vapor injection system 32d via bypass 140 and<br>
check valve 142. The refrigerant is then received by the vapor injection system 32d<br>
at an inlet 144 of the plate heat exchanger 132 and discharged at an outlet 146.<br>
Once the refrigerant is discharged, the refrigerant passes through the second<br>
control valve 136 prior to reaching the indoor unit 26. While the expansion devices<br>
134 and 136 are shown adjacent to the outdoor and indoor heat exchangers 24, 26,<br>
expansion devices 134, 136 may be located in any position between the plate heat<br>
exchanger 32d and the respective heat exchangers 26 and 24. Expansion devices<br>
with built-in check valves may obviate the need for check valves 142 and 150 and<br>
may also be used with the invention.<br>
[0073] In the HEAT mode, control valve 136 is closed to restrict<br>
refrigerant from flowing from the indoor unit 26 to the vapor injection system 32d. A<br>
bypass 148 and check valve 150 allow refrigerant to reach the plate heat<br>
exchanger 132 when the control valve 134 is closed. After the refrigerant passes<br>
through the control valve 134, the refrigerant encounters control valve 138 prior to<br>
reaching the plate heat exchanger 132. Control valve 138 is an electronic<br>
expansion valve and is operable to selectively meter the amount of liquid refrigerant<br>
reaching the plate heat exchanger 132 and, thus, the amount of vaporized<br>
refrigerant reaching the scroll compressor 28. If the scroll compressor 28 requires<br>
a significant amount of vaporized refrigerant, valve 138 may be opened fully,<br>
thereby maximizing an amount of liquid refrigerant passing though the plate heat<br>
exchanger 132. The more liquid refrigerant heated by plate 132, the more vapor<br>
that will be produced. In this regard, control valve 138 may serve not only to meter<br>
the amount of liquid entering the plate heat exchanger 132, but may meter the<br>
amount of vapor reaching the scroll compressor 28.<br>
[0074] It should be noted that control valves 134, 136 cooperate with<br>
control valve 138 to regulate refrigerant flow within the system 22d. In this regard,<br>
the valves 134, 136, 138 can be selectively opened and closed to distribute<br>
refrigerant to the vapor injection system 32d, scroll compressor 28, and heat<br>
exchangers 34, 38 to properly balance the system 22d and optimize capacity and<br>
efficiency. In addition, valves 134 and 136 may alternatively be replaced by fixed<br>
restrictive expansion devices and, as such, should be considered within the scope<br>
of the present teachings.<br>
[0075] Valve 138 is operable to selectively restrict refrigerant from<br>
reaching the heat plate exchanger 132, as previously discussed. When valve 138<br>
is closed, refrigerant bypasses the vapor injection system 32d by traveling between<br>
the inlet 144 and outlet 146 of heat plate 132, as indicated by directional arrows in<br>
FIG. 7. In this manner, the system 22d may be tailored such that the vapor<br>
injection system 32d is only utilized under one of the HEAT mode or the COOL<br>
mode. If the vapor injection system 32d is only used during the HEAT mode, valve<br>
138 will be closed during the COOL mode to restrict refrigerant from entering the<br>
heat plate exchanger 132. Similarly, if the vapor injection system 32d is only used<br>
during the COOL mode, valve 138 will be closed during the HEAT mode to restrict<br>
refrigerant from entering the heat plate exchanger 132. In this manner, the vapor<br>
injection system 32d may be selectively used during either COOLING or<br>
HEATING, depending on the particular application and system requirements.<br>
[0076] With reference to FIG. 8, a cooling system 22e is shown. In<br>
view of the similarity in structure and function of the components associated with<br>
the heat pump systems described above, like reference numerals are used<br>
hereinafter and in the drawings to identify like components while like reference<br>
numerals containing letter extensions are used to identify those components that<br>
have been modified.<br>
[0077] The cooling system 22e is generally used for refrigerating or<br>
cooling an interior space. The cooling system 22e may be incorporated into a<br>
chiller, refrigeration or air-conditioning system to cool an interior space. As shown<br>
in FIG. 8, the cooling system 22e is incorporated into a refrigerator 160, whereby<br>
the indoor unit 26 is disposed therein and the outdoor unit 24 is disposed external<br>
to the refrigerator 160 and is more commonly referred to as the condensing unit<br>
162. Monobloc construction is also possible where the outdoor and indoor units 24,<br>
26 are constructed in the same frame and the working principle is similar. While a<br>
refrigerator 160 is disclosed, it should be understood that the cooling system 22e<br>
could be used in other cooling devices such as a refrigerated display case, freezer,<br>
chiller, or air-conditioning system, each of which is considered within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0078] The condensing unit 162 includes the outdoor coil 34, an<br>
expansion device 32e, and a compressor 28e. A receiver 164 may also be<br>
included, in which case it may be fluidly coupled to an outlet 166 of coil 34 and is<br>
operable to receive and store fluid refrigerant from the coil 34 for use in the<br>
expansion device 32e, as will be discussed further below. The flash tank 32e and<br>
receiver 164 may also be combined into a single component.<br>
[0079] The expansion device 32e is fluidly coupled to the receiver 164<br>
via conduit 168 such that liquid refrigerant flows between the receiver 164 and<br>
expansion device 32e along conduit 164. In addition, a capillary tube 170 may be<br>
disposed proximate to an inlet 60e of the expansion device 32e and may partially<br>
expand the refrigerant prior to entering the expansion device 32e.<br>
[0080] The expansion device 32e includes a flash tank 56e and a float<br>
device 86e and is operable to vaporize refrigerant from the outdoor coil 34 for use<br>
by the compressor 28e and to concurrently produce a sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant<br>
for use by the indoor coil 38. The flash tank 56e is fluidly coupled to the outdoor<br>
coil 34 via conduit 168 and fluidly coupled to the indoor coil 38 via conduit 72 and<br>
exit port 64. In addition, the flash tank 56e is fluidly coupled to the compressor 28e<br>
via outlet port 62 and conduit 172. Conduit 172 is fluidly coupled to the compressor<br>
28e at a vapor injection port 48e and is operable to deliver the pressurized-vapor<br>
refrigerant to the compressor 28e. As previously discussed with regard to FIGS. 1 -<br>
7, an increase in system efficiency and capacity may be realized by delivering a<br>
stream of pressurized-vapor to the vapor injection port 48e of the compressor 28e.<br>
[0081] The expansion device 32e may include float device 86e for use in<br>
metering refrigerant into the interior space 66 of the flash tank 56e. The float<br>
device 86e is operable to react to an amount of liquid refrigerant disposed within<br>
the flash tank 56e and to selectively permit more refrigerant into the tank 56 when a<br>
predetermined lower limit is realized. As the float device 86e has been sufficiently<br>
described with respect to FIGS. 1-7, a detailed description of its structure and<br>
function is foregone. It should be noted, however, that the float device 86e has<br>
been modified to accommodate the inlet 60a. More particularly, the inlet 60a has<br>
been moved so as to receive liquid refrigerant from the outdoor coil 34 at an<br>
opposite location to that of inlet 60 in the previous embodiments.<br>
[0082] In addition, the expansion device 32e may include insulation 174<br>
generally surrounding the flash tank 56e and conduits 70, 72, and 172. The<br>
insulation 174 ensures the sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant maintains its state when<br>
traveling between the flash tank 56e and indoor unit 26 along conduits 70 and 72.<br>
Similarly, the insulation 174 ensures that the vaporized refrigerant maintains its<br>
state when traveling from the flash tank 56e to the compressor 28e. As can be<br>
appreciated, more insulation 174 may be required depending on the relative<br>
distances between the flash tank 56e and the indoor unit 26 and compressor 28e.<br>
[0083] While insulation has been described and shown in relation to<br>
cooling system 22e, it should be noted that insulation 174 can be provided for any<br>
of the foregoing heat pump systems. More particularly, the greater the distance<br>
between the respective components, the more likely it will be that the refrigerant will<br>
change phase prior to reaching the indoor unit 26 and compressor 28, respectively.<br>
[0084] An expansion device 176 may be disposed proximate to an inlet<br>
178 of the indoor unit 26 and may partially expand the sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant<br>
prior to reaching the indoor coil 38. The expansion device 176 may be an<br>
electronically-controlled expansion device (EXV), a thermally-controlled expansion<br>
device (TXV), a capillary tube or an evaporator pressure regulator. It should be<br>
noted that if an evaporator pressure regulator is used, an EXV may also be used in<br>
conjunction therewith to further control refrigerant flow into the indoor unit 26.<br>
[0085] With particular reference to FIG. 8, the operation of the cooling<br>
system 22e will be described in detail. When liquid refrigerant exits outlet 166 of<br>
the outdoor unit 24, it enters the receiver 164, if included, and may be stored there<br>
for use by the expansion device 32e. When the expansion device 32e requires<br>
liquid refrigerant, refrigerant may be drawn from the receiver 164 and into the flash<br>
tank 56e for use in producing both pressurized-vapor refrigerant and sub-cooled-<br>
liquid refrigerant.<br>
[0086] As the liquid refrigerant travels along conduit 168, the capillary<br>
tube 170 serves to partially expand the fluid prior to entering the flash tank 56e.<br>
Once in the tank 56, the refrigerant releases heat, thereby concurrently producing<br>
both a pressurized-vapor refrigerant and a sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant, as<br>
previously discussed. The pressurized-vapor refrigerant it directed toward the<br>
vapor injection port 48e of the compressor 28e while the sub-cooled-liquid<br>
refrigerant is directed toward the indoor unit 26 via conduits 72, 70 and expansion<br>
device 176.<br>
[0087] After the pressurized-vapor refrigerant has been sufficiently<br>
compressed by the compressor 28e, the fluid may be directed to the outdoor unit<br>
24 via conduit 74. The sub-cooled-liquid refrigerant is expanded by the expansion<br>
device 176 and absorbs heat from an interior space of the refrigerator 160. As can<br>
be appreciated, by absorbing heat from the refrigerator 160, the interior space is<br>
heated and the refrigerant is vaporized. After the refrigerant is vaporized, it exits<br>
the indoor unit 26 and returns to the compressor 26e via conduit 78 for<br>
compression. The compressed refrigerant is mixed with the pressurized-vapor<br>
refrigerant from the flash tank 56e and is then sent to the outdoor unit 24 to begin<br>
the process anew.<br>
[0088] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as<br>
a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
