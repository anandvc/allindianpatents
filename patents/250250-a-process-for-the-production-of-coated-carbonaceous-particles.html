TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of coated carbonaceous particles. More particularly, the present invention relates to coated carbonaceous particles which find particular use as electrode materials, as well as methods for the manufacture of said coated carbonaceous particles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Carbonaceous materials are widely used in electrical storage cells, also referred to as "batteries" due to their efficiency and reasonable cost. Vano~us forms of carbonaceous matenals are used. One such carbonaceous material is graphite, which is known to be useful in rechargeable storage cells, also referred to as "rechargeable batteries", in a salient example, graphitic materials are known to be useful as anode matenals in rechargeable lithium ion, "Li-ion" storage cells. Li-ion cells are mainly used as the power sources in portable electrpnic devices. <br>
As opposed to other classes of rechargeable batteries, i.e.. e.g., nfckel-cadmium and nickel-metal hydride storage cells, Li-ion cells are increasingly popular due to their relatively higher storage capacity, and their easily rechargeable nature. Due to  such higher storage capacity per unit mass or unit volume, Li-ion cells may be produced which meet specific storage and current delivery requirements as they are smaller than similarly rated, nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal hydride storage cells. Consequently, Li-ion cells are popularly<br>
used in a growing number of devices, i.e., digital cameras, digital video recorders, computers, etc., where small sized devices are particularly desirable from a utility or consumer standpoint. Nonetheless, rechargeable Li-ion storage cells are not without their shortcomings, certain of which are dependent upon their materials of construction.<br>
Popular types of Li-ion storage cells include electrodes formed of mesophase carbon micro beads (MCMB) or micronized mesophase carbon fiber (MMCF). However, both MCMB and MMCF are relatively expensive due to relatively complex manufacturing processes required for these materials. Further types of Li-ion storage cells include electrodes formed of comminuted or milled graphitic materials which are derived from purified natural graphite or synthetic graphite. While these materials exhibit satisfactory storage capacity, they unfortunately exhibit a low initial charging efficiency on their first cycle. Typically, the charging efficiency of these materials ranges widely, usually from as little as about 40% to as high as about 90%. It is known that the efficiency of these comminuted or milled graphitic materials is strongly dependent upon the morphology of the comminuted or milled graphitic particles. Due to their irregular nature, these pulvurent comminuted or milled graphitic materials frequently suffer from a low packing density which also limits the density from any electrode formed therefrom, which also limits the operating characteristics of a rechargeable storage cell. Also, due to their irregular nature, processing these pulvurent comminuted or milled graphitic materials into electrodes is difficult. In such electrodes formed from pulvurent comminuted or milled graphitic materials, it has been suggested that poor operating characteristics is in part attributable to the formation of a passive film on the surfaces of these pulvurent materials. Such a film is frequently described in the art as being a solid electrolyte interface ("SEI"). The formation of this SEI irreversibly consumes a quantifiable amount, frequently a significant amount of lithium ions (typically 15 to 50%) present in the cathode upon cell assembly or use.<br>
Accordingly there exists a real and continuing need in the art for improved materials useful in the manufacture of storage cells, particularly rechargeable storage cells which exhibit improved operating characteristics. There also exist needs in the art for improved<br>
methods for the manufacture of improved materials useful in the manufacture of such storage cells, as well as for improved storage cells containing said improved materials.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides processes for the manufacture of coated carbonaceous particles, which materials exhibit improved operating characteristics when used as electrodes in electrical storage cells, particularly in rechargeable electrical storage cells. Generally the process contemplates the steps of:<br>
providing particles of a carbonaceous material;<br>
providing a coating of a fusible, carbon residue forming material onto the surface of<br>
said particles;<br>
stabilizing the coated particles by subjecting said particles to an oxidation reaction<br>
using an oxidizing agent;<br>
subsequently carbonizing the coated particles; and,<br>
thereafter optionally, but preferably graphitizing the coated particles. Preferably the process provides particles having a substantially smooth coatings.<br>
Particles of carbonaceous material are required for the practice of the invention. These may be obtained from a variety of sources, examples of which include pitches,<br>
petroleum and coal tar cokes, synthetic and natural graphites, soft carbons derived from organic and natural polymers as well as other sources of carbonaceous materials which are known in the manufacture of prior art electrodes although these sources are not elucidated here. Preferred sources of carbonaceous materials include calcined or un-calcined petroleum cokes, as well as natural and synthetic graphite. Particularly preferred sources of carbonaceous materials include calcined and un-calcined, highly crystalline "needle" cokes. Thus, preferred carbonaceous materials are either graphitic or form graphite on heating to graphitization temperatures of 2200°C or higher. Fine particles of such materials are conveniently provided by milling, crushing, grinding or by any other means which can be used to provide a pulvurent carbonaceous material having particles of dimensions which are suitable for use in the formation of electrodes. Although the principles of the present invention are believed to be applicable to carbonaceous particles of varying sizes and particle size distributions, preferred carbonaceous particles having average particle sizes of up to about 150 urn, more preferably from about 5 µm to about 70 µm, and most preferably average particle sizes in the range of about 5 µm to about 45 µm are particularly preferred. Further, it is preferred that within these ranges, the particle size distribution is preferably such that not more than 10 weight % of the particles are smaller than 5 µm, not more than 10 weight % of the particles are larger than 60   m;  further it is still more preferred that in addition to such a particle size distribution that the mean particle size is about 10 urn to about 30 µm.<br>
According to a step of the inventive process, the carbonaceous particles are provided with a fusible, carbon residue forming material as a coating material. Preferred for use as the coating material are carbon residue forming materials which can be reacted with an oxidizing agent. Preferred compounds include those with a high melting point and a high carbon yield after thermal decomposition. Exemplary useful coating materials include heavy aromatic residues from petroleum, chemical process pitches; lignin from pulp industry; phenolic resins, and carbohydrate materials such as sugars and polyacrylonitriles. Especially preferred for use as coating materials are petroleum and coal tar pitches, and lignin which are readily<br>
available and have been observed to be effective as fusible, carbon residue forming materials.<br>
It is to be understood that the carbon residue forming material may be any material which, when oxidized and then thermally decomposed in an inert atmosphere to a carbonization temperature of 850°C or an even greater temperature forms a residue which is "substantially carbon". It is to be understood that "substantially carbon" indicates that at the residue is at least 90% by wt. carbon, preferably at least 95% by wt. carbon. It is also preferred that the carbon residue forming material form at least 10% and preferably at least 40% and more preferably at least 60% carbon residue on carbonization, based on the original mass of the carbon residue forming material.<br>
Any organic compound that can be oxidized and then thermally decomposed to yield carbon residue can be used as the coating material. However, in coating processes in which the organic compounds are dissolved in solvent, aromatic compounds that include various molecular weights are preferred because of mutual dissolution of the compound with the solvent(s). Preferred compounds include those with a high melting point and a high carbon yield after thermal decomposition (e.g., petroleum and coal tar pitches).<br>
Any useful technique for coating the carbonaceous particles may be used. By way of non-limiting examples, useful techniques include the steps of: liquefying the carbon residue forming material by a means such as melting or forming a solution with a suitable solvent combined with a coating step such as spraying the liquefied carbon residue forming material onto the carbonaceous particles, or dipping the carbonaceous particles in the liquefied carbon residue forming material and subsequently drying out any solvent. Further useful techniques include selective precipitation of a carbon residue forming material on the carbonaceous particles which may be preferred in certain circumstances.<br>
A further technique which may be used includes providing a dry coating of the carbon residue forming material onto the carbonaceous particles such as by mixing or tumbling these materials until a coating of the carbon residue material is provided on the surface of the<br>
carbonaceous particles, after which the dry coating is then fused to provide a coating upon the surface of the carbonaceous particles. While any of these coating techniques may be practiced, preferred methods include those which provide a relatively uniform coating thickness of the carbon residue forming material on the carbonaceous particles and which minimize clumping or agglomeration of the coated particles. The amount of the carbon residue forming material deposited on the carbonaceous particles may also vary widely, and it is understood that this amount depends in part on factors including the uniformity of the coating and the specific form and surfaces of the carbonaceous particles. Although the amount of coating may vary from as little as l%wt. to as much as 50%wt., expressed as the percentage of the mass of the coating relative to the total mass of the coated particles as measured by weighing the dry particles before and after coating, preferably the amount of coating ranges from about 2.5%wt. to about 25%wt, more preferably ranges from about 5%wt. to about 20%wt.<br>
A particularly useful method of forming a uniform coating of a carbon-residue-forming material by precipitating the material onto the surface of the particles is provided according to the following process. First, a concentrated solution of the carbon-residue-forming material in a suitable solvent is formed. The solution of carbon residue forming material is prepared by combining the carbon residue forming material with a solvent or a combination of solvents. The solvent should be compatible with the carbon residue forming, i.e., coating, material and should dissolve all or a substantial portion of the coating material. Solvents include pure organic compounds or a mixture of different solvents. The choice of solvent(s) depends on the particular coating material used. Suitable solvents for dissolving the carbon residue forming material include, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene, quinoline, tetrahydrofuran, naphthalene, acetone, cyclohexane, tetrahydronaphthalene (sold by DuPont under the trademark Tetralin), ether, water,   methyl-pyrrolidinone, etc.   When a petroleum or coal tar pitch is used as the carbon residue forming material, for example, solvents such as toluene, xylene, quinoline, tetrahydrofuran, Tetralin, naphthalene are preferred. The ratio of the solvent(s) to the carbon residue forming material in the solution and the temperature of the solution is controlled so that the carbon residue forming material completely or almost completely dissolves into the solvent. Typically, the solvent to carbon<br>
residue forming material ratio is less than 2, and preferably about 1 or less, and the carbon residue forming material is dissolved in the solvent at a temperature that is below the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
Concentrated solutions wherein the solvent to solute ratio is less than about 2:1 are commonly known as flux solutions. Many pitch-type materials form concentrated flux solutions wherein the pitch is highly soluble when mixed with solvent at solvent to pitch ratios of 0.5 to 2.0. Dilution of these flux mixtures with the same solvent or a solvent in which the carbon residue forming material is less soluble results in partial precipitation of the carbon residue forming coating material. When this dilution and precipitation occurs in the presence of a suspension of carbonaceous particles, the particles act as nucleating sites for the precipitation. The result is an especially uniform coating of the carbon-residue-forming material on the particles.<br>
Coating of the carbonaceous particles can be effected by mixing the particles into or with the solution of carbon residue forming material directly. When the particles are added to the solution of carbon residue forming material directly, additional solvent(s) is generally added to the resulting mixture to effect partial precipitation of the carbon residue forming material. The additional solvent(s) can be the same as or different than the solvents used to prepare the solution of carbon residue forming materials.<br>
Alternatively, a suspension of particles of a carbonaceous material can be prepared by homogeneously mixing the particles in the same solvent used to form the solution of carbon residue forming material, in a combination of solvents or in a different solvent to a desired temperature, preferably below the boiling point of the solvent(s). The suspension of carbonaceous particles is then combined with the solution of carbon residue forming material causing a certain portion of the carbon residue forming material to deposit substantially uniformly on the surface of the carbonaceous particles.<br>
The total amount and morphology of the carbon residue forming material that precipitates onto the surface of the particles depends on the portion of the carbon residue<br>
forming material that precipitates out from the solution, which in turn depends on the difference in the solubility of the carbon residue forming material in the initial solution and in the final solution. When the carbon residue forming material is a pitch, a wide range of molecular weight species are typically present. One skilled in the art would recognize that partial precipitation of such a material would fractionate the material such that the precipitate would be relatively high molecular weight and high melting and the remaining solubles would be relatively low molecular weight and low melting compared to the original pitch.<br>
The solubility of the carbon residue forming material in a given solvent or solvent mixture depends on a variety of factors including, for example, concentration, temperature, and pressure. As stated earlier, dilution of concentrated flux solutions causes solubility to decrease. Since the solubility of the carbon-residue-forming material in an organic solvent increases with temperature, precipitation of the coating is further enhanced by starting the process at an elevated temperature and gradually lowering the temperature during the coating process. The carbon residue forming material can be deposited at either ambient or reduced pressure and at a temperature of about -5°C to about 400°C. By adjusting the total ratio of solvent to the carbon residue forming material and the solution temperature, the total amount and hardness of the precipitated carbon residue forming material on the infusible carbon containing particles can be controlled.<br>
The suspension of coated carbonaceous particles in the final diluted solution of carbon residue forming material generally has a ratio of solvent to carbon residue forming material of greater than about 2; and preferably greater than about 4. For example, where petroleum or coal tar pitch is chosen as the carbon residue forming material and toluene is chosen as the solvent, the ratio of toluene to the pitch should be less than or equal to 1 for the initial solution, but should be greater than 3, preferably greater than 5, for the mixture of particles, carbon residue forming material, and combined solvent(s).   It would be understood by one skilled in the art that the specific solvent to carbon-residue-forming pitch ratio at the conclusion of the coating process depends on the carbon-forming-residue material and solvent selected for the process. On one hand, it is desirable to use as little solvent as possible<br>
because of the cost of solvent, while on the other hand, enough solvent is required so that the carbonaceous particles can be dispersed in the solvent.<br>
Upon completion of the precipitation step, the coated particles are separated from the mixture of solvent, carbonaceous particles, and carbon residue forming material using conventional methods, such as, for example, centrifugal separation, or filtration. The particles then are optionally washed with solvent to remove residual pitch (or other carbon forming residue forming material) solution and dried using conventional methods.<br>
The liquid remaining after separation of the coated particles includes solvent(s) and residual carbon residue forming material. The solvent can be recovered from the solution by conventional methods, such as, for example, distillation under reduced pressure or evaporation at elevated temperature. Preferably, the separation of solvent from the residual carbon forming material is carried out at elevated temperature so that the carbon residue remains in liquid form. If different solvents are used to prepare the coating material solution(s) and the precipitation solution, a multi-stage distillation system may be needed to recover the multiple solvents. The recovered solvent can be directly fed back to the system and reused in the process, while the carbon-residue-forming-material is discharged from the process.<br>
According to a further step of the inventive process, the coating of the carbonaceous particles are rendered partly or completely infusible, preferably by oxidative stabilization. The coating of the carbonaceous particles are stabilized by subjecting said particles to an oxidation reaction using an oxidizing agent under appropriate reaction conditions. Generally, only mild to moderate reaction conditions are required. Typically the oxidation reaction is satisfactorily performed by contacting the coated carbonaceous particles with an oxidizing agent at elevated temperatures or by contacting the coated carbonaceous particles with an oxidizing agent at mild conditions and activating the oxidizing agent at elevated temperatures. Contact with the oxidizing agent can occur at ambient temperatures (approx. 20°C) or at moderately elevated temperatures, (up to approx. 400°C).   Activation of the oxidizing agent would typically occur at moderately elevated temperatures up to 400°C.<br>
Preferably, the temperature of the oxidation reaction is maintained below the instantaneous melting point of the coating material, so to ensure that melting point of the coating material is not exceeded during the oxidation reaction.<br>
The manner of practice of this step of the inventive process is understood to be dependent upon the form of the oxidizing agent utilized, which may be solid, liquid or gaseous under the reaction conditions. Likewise, various oxidation reaction processes and reaction conditions may be practiced and are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Wherein the oxidizing agent is a solid, it is required only that the solid oxidizing agent be placed in sufficiently intimate contact with the coated carbonaceous particles such that, under appropriate reaction conditions, a satisfactory degree of oxidation is obtained. This is most effectively accomplished by forming a liquid solution of the oxidizing agent, applying this solution to the coated particles and drying. When practical, it is preferred to apply the carbon residue forming material and oxidant coatings at the same time in a single step. Where necessary, the oxidizing agent can be brought to suitable reaction conditions in order to insure the initiation and success of an oxidation reaction. Such conditions may take place under ambient pressure and temperature conditions (approximately 20°C, 1 atm) however, depending upon the nature of the oxidizing agent, the nature of the carbon residue forming (coating) material, as well as in part the nature and form of any reaction vessel which may be used for the oxidation reaction, it may be desirous to modify the temperature and/or pressure, or both from ambient. Typically, elevating the temperature up to 400°C facilitates the initiation and the subsequent oxidation reaction, but in fact, any temperature under the instantaneous melting temperature of the coating material can be successfully used. With regard to the nature of any reaction vessel, any conventionally used reaction vessel or device can be used. With regard to the identity of solid oxidizing agents, by way of non-limiting examples, these include: inorganic and organic oxidizers such as metal oxides and salts such as alkali nitrates and alkali sulfates such as are represented by MNO3 and M2SO4, where M denotes an alkali metal, as well as M'Ox where M' represents a transition metal.<br>
Exemplary solid oxidizing agents further include inorganic salts such as sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and organic salts, as well as those described in the following examples.<br>
Where the oxidizing agent is a liquid, it is required only that the oxidizing agent be provided in a liquid form which is compatible with the coated carbonaceous particles. It is clearly contemplated that the oxidizing agent itself need not constitute 100% of the liquid, but rather that the oxidizing agent be provided as a solution, suspension, or other fluid which comprises an oxidizing agent or agents therein. It is anticipated that when the oxidizing agent is supplied as a solution or suspension, it may be desirable to include a drying step so to dry the coated particles. It is contemplated that the oxidizing agent, when present in a liquid form, is also compatible with the coated carbonaceous particles namely, that any portion of the liquid does not act to undesirably degrade or solubilize the fusible, carbon residue forming material or for that matter, the carbonaceous particles themselves. By way of non-limiting example, exemplary oxidizing agents which are provided in a liquid form include various oxidizing acids such as nitric acid, perchlorate acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid or as well as aqueous and non-aqueous solutions containing oxidizing salts such as peroxides and KMnO4   Additional liquid oxidizing agents include peroxides and aryl quinones, as well as those described in one or more of the examples.<br>
The nature of the condition of the oxidizing reaction is not critical to the practice of the invention wherein the oxidizing agent is in a liquid form. Rather, it is only required that the reaction conditions be appropriate to insure the oxidation of at least a portion of the coating provided to the carbonaceous particles such that they form a stabilized, coating thereupon. Any conventional reactor, and appropriate reaction conditions can be used. As described previously, with respect to solid oxidizing agents, the reaction conditions can take place at ambient temperature and pressure conditions, or may require different conditions depending upon the coating, the nature of the carbonaceous particles, the reaction vessel, and of course, the nature of the oxidizing agent utilized. With regard to reactor vessels, stirred reactor vessels which are optionally pressurized are conveniently used.<br>
Where the oxidizing agent is gaseous, again it is required only that this gaseous oxidizing agent be brought into sufficient intimate contact with the coated carbonaceous particles under appropriate reaction condition in order to insure the oxidization reaction of the carbon residue forming material. According to this aspect of the invention, a gaseous oxidizing agent may be most convenient to use in many circumstances due to the fact that under appropriate reaction conditions, good mixing and contact with the coated carbonaceous particles is easily achievable. By way of non-limiting example, exemplary gaseous oxidizing agents include: oxygen, sulfur fumes, gaseous oxides and halogens. Preferred oxidizing agents include oxygen, nitrogen oxide gas, as well as, under certain conditions, ambient air which of course includes an appreciable proportion of oxygen gas.<br>
With regard to the reaction conditions required, wherein the oxidizing agent is gaseous, again, it is required only that such reaction conditions be appropriate to insure the oxidization of the carbon residue forming material which is present on the carbonaceous particles. Under certain conditions, ambient pressure and temperature may be sufficient, but yet again as described with reference to the other forms of oxidizing agents described previously, it may be advantageous to insure that slightly elevated temperatures and/or pressures i.e., temperatures in the range of between 30°C-400°C and/or slightly elevated pressures, i.e., 1-10 atm be established to initiate or maintain the oxidation reaction. Again, it is understood that the appropriate reaction conditions are highly dependant upon the nature of the carbon residue forming material used to coat the carbonaceous particles, the specific gaseous oxidizing agent, as well as the reaction vessel itself. Useful reaction vessels are those which necessarily can contain, or bring into contact, the gaseous oxidizing agent with the coated carbonaceous particles and while many conventional vessels can be used, the use of the fluidized bed reactor is preferred. Utilization of a fluidized bed reactor wherein the gas flow stream comprises the gaseous oxidizing agent is preferred as effective intimate contact between the gaseous oxidizing agent and the coated carbonaceous particles are reliably assured.<br>
According to a further step of the inventive process the stabilized coated carbonaceous particles are subsequently carbonized, and/or graphitized depending on the<br>
materials used. When the carbonaceous material used to produce the stabilized coated particles is a high-carbon material such as calcined coke, natural graphite or synthetic graphite, the particles can be directly graphitized without an intervening carbonization step. Additionally, when the carbonaceous material is graphite, useful products are formed by only carbonizing the stabilized, coated particles. When the carbonaceous material is a softer carbon such as green coke or a soft carbon derived from a natural of synthetic polymer, it is preferred to carbonize the stabilized coated particles to a temperature of about 400 to about 2000°C and then graphitize the particles at a temperature of about 2200°C or higher.<br>
According to this further step, heating of the coated and stabilized carbonaceous particles takes place under appropriate reaction conditions in order to insure a high degree, or a complete carbonization thereof. With regard to the temperature required to insure carbonization, desirably this is achieved by raising the temperature in a controlled manner from a starting temperature, usually ambient temperature, to the final carbonization temperature which falls within the above-identified range of about about 400 to about 2000°C and preferably within the range of about 550°C to about 1500°C.<br>
With regard to the temperature rise, this can vary due to the nature of the reacted coated carbonaceous particles, as well as the reaction conditions and apparatus used. With regard to the apparatus, typically conventional ovens are quite satisfactorily used, although it is preferred that sealed ovens wherein a specific atmosphere can be maintained during the carbonization process are used. Sealed ovens wherein a reduced pressure may be maintained, especially vacuum ovens are particularly advantageous.<br>
With regard to the atmospheric conditions for the carbonization process, the atmosphere may be ambient air up to about 850°C but an inert atmosphere is preferred at temperatures above about 400°C. Ambient air is an acceptable atmosphere when the oxygen is largely displaced during heating or during heating under vacuum. Suitable inert atmospheres include nitrogen, argon, helium, etc. which are non-reactive with the heated coated carbonaceous particles.<br>
With regard to the temperature conditions, these can vary widely but generally, the rate of temperature rise to which the reacted coated carbonaceous particles are subjected in order to achieve carbonization thereof is on the order of 0.5°C-20°C/min. Such a controlled temperature rise insures that good carbonization results are achieved. Preferably however the coated carbonaceous particles are heated to a final carbonization temperature gradually, and with at least one intermediate heat treatment step where prior to the final carbonization temperature used in a process, the coated carbonaceous particles are heated to an intermediate temperature, and maintained at that intermediate temperature for an interval of time. The intermediate temperature or the period for which such intermediate temperature is maintained may vary, and will be understood to depend from process to process. It is to be understood that the inclusion of one or more such periods of time during which the particles are maintained at such intermediate temperatures is beneficial in facilitating the polymerization or other ordering of the coating present on the carbonaceous particles. Indeed, the practice of several such intermediate heat treatment steps is further preferred over the practice of a single heat treatment step in that the provision of more than one heat treatment steps in which the coated particles are maintained at a constant temperature is believed to impart improved characteristics to the coated carbonaceous particles over particles which have undergone but one or no such heat treatment step. It is further to be understood that during the heating of the coated carbonaceous particles particular attention must be paid to ensure that neither the temperatures attained during this heating process, nor the rate of the temperature rise during any part of the heating process be such that the instantaneous melting point of the coating upon the carbonaceous particles is exceeded. More simply stated, the thermal degradation of the coating is to be effected by a controlled temperature rise wherein the process temperature is maintained at or below the instantaneous melting point of the coating where said melting point is generally increasing with time during the process. In view of this requirement, preferred heating processes are those which exhibit slower rates of temperature rise. Particular preferred examples of such heat treatment steps are described with reference to one or more of the Examples.<br>
Subsequent to the attainment of the maximum temperature use for the carbonization process, the coated carbonaceous particles having been carbonized may be cooled to ambient<br>
temperature, although this is not an essential requirement. Again, the cooling rate is desirably controlled, i.e., to be within about 3°C-100°C/min. although, this cooling rate has been observed to be typically far less limiting as the rate of temperature rise during the carbonization process.<br>
The most preferred aspects of the invention result in the provision of a smooth coating upon individual carbonaceous particles.   Preferably the stabilization of the coating is followed by controlled heating of the coated stabilized particles so as to effect carbonization of the coated particles with little or no clumping or self-adhesion of the individual particles. The desired results   are coated particles with little or no broken fracture surfaces of the type which are characteristically form when the separate particles fuse and must be crushed or broken apart in order to provide a free flowing powder. Such fracture surfaces are desirably minimized or avoided as they are believed to contribute to low electrochemical efficiency when the particles are used as an anode material in rechargeable electrical storage cells, particularly in rechargeable lithium ion batteries.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the inventive process taught herein, the carbon residue forming material is provided in a fluid form. It has been observed by the inventors that when the carbon residue forming material is precipitated from a liquid, a smooth coating forms at the interface of the individual carbonaceous particles and the surrounding liquid. A smooth coating is retained when subsequently carbonized.<br>
Although less advantageous, when the carbon residue forming coating is supplied as a solid, it is desirably fused on the surface of the carbonaceous particles in order to form a smooth coating thereon.<br>
The stabilization step of the current invention is carried out to render the surface of the coating infusible to the subsequent carbonization step. Oxidative stabilization allows the smooth surface produced in the coating process to be preserved in the final coated particles of the instant invention, as the oxidative stabilization renders the surface of the coating infusible to the subsequent carbonization step.<br>
Heat treatment of the stabilized coated particles is desirably conducted in a controlled mamier in order to minimize fusion of the particles. One skilled in the art will recognize that highly stabilized, infusible coated particles can be heated relatively aggressively and quickly during carbonization. In contrast, relatively mildly stabilized coated particles require slower heating in order to avoid excessive melting of the coating and fusion of the particles. Use of a fluidized bed during stabilization and heat treatment is especially beneficial in preventing clumping and fusion of the coated particles.<br>
Especially preferred embodiments of the present invention produce a free-flowing powder of coated particles after the carbonization and/or graphitization steps, which particles exhibit little or no fusion among the particles, but can generally be broken into a free-flowing powder by simple mechanical agitation, such as by use of a stirring rod, or by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger. Where some fusion may have occurred between particles, and mechanical agitation is used to separate these particles which may result in the fonnation of new fracture surfaces, in the preferred embodiments of the invention these fracture surfaces do not comprise more than 10%, preferably no more than 2% of the total surface area of the particles. Such are considered as being substantially smooth coatings.<br>
While it is preferred that the carbonized coated carbonaceous particles be graphitized before use, graphitization is not essential as the carbonized coated carbonaceous particles produced by the inventive process may be used directly in various applications, including in the formation of electrodes, particularly anodes in batteries, especially in rechargeable batteries.<br>
As is discussed in more detail with reference to the examples following, the use of the materials according as anodes in lithium ion batteries is particularly advantageous.<br>
Preferably however, the carbonized coated carbonaceous particles are also graphitized by heating them to a still higher elevated temperature which is in excess of the temperatures reached during the carbonization step. The advantage of graphitization is many-fold, and<br>
most significantly the graphitization process frequently allows for the generation of a more ordered crystal lattice in the coated carbonaceous particles. A certain improved crystal lattice provides more regular and uniform structure, and is also believed to improve the charge capacity of a battery containing the coated carbonaceous particles described herein. It is especially noteworthy that the graphitized coated particles of this invention show high capacity at a low potential of 0.0 to 0.5 volts. This is highly advantageous in making rechargeable batteries from these materials.<br>
Graphitization also removes impurities. This purification step is especially important when impure carbons such as natural graphite are used as the source of the carbonaceous particles of this invention.<br>
With regard to appropriate graphitization conditions, again these are to be understood to vary according to the specific nature of the carbonized, coated carbonaceous particles, as well as the reaction conditions required to bring about the graphitization. Generally, the same apparatus used for the carbonization step may also be conveniently used, it only being required that such device be capable of further elevating the temperature to a temperature or range of temperatures wherein the effects of graphitization is observed to occur. Typically, graphitization occurs in the temperature range of about 2200°C-3200°C, although lower or higher temperatures might also be used in this step. It is required only that a satisfactory degree of graphitization be obtained during this step, such that an improved charging capacity is achieved.<br>
With regard to the process conditions it is desired that graphitization is performed in an inert atmosphere such as described previously. Graphitization can immediately follow carbonization, in which case the carbonized coated carbonaceous particles are retained in a reaction apparatus, i.e., an oven, and the temperature is raised up to an appropriate graphitization temperature. With regard to the rate of this temperature rise, desirably this is maintained in the same rate as that used for the carbonization step although, greater or lesser rates of temperature rise can also be utilized depending upon the nature of the carbonized coated carbonaceous particles.<br>
A preferred aspect of the present invention is in the pitch coating process, or carbon-residue-forming material coating process. This coating process provides uniform carbon-residue-forming coating on carbonaceous particles regardless of particle size. The coating can be accomplished in a number of ways but it is especially advantageous to precipitate the coating material in the presence of a suspension of the carbonaceous particles. This coating method yields a uniform coating of controlled composition and produces a loose composite particle powder, so that the pitch-coated particles do not agglomerate and no further milling process is required in the subsequent process steps.<br>
Another preferred aspect of the present invention is in an oxidation reaction which is carried out on the coated particles prior to carbonization of the coating. The oxidation reaction is believed to provide certain technical benefits. First, it is believed that the reacted coated particles are relatively infusible following oxidation, which is particularly desirable in view of subsequent process steps, and subsequent handling of the particles. Second, it is believed that the reacted coated particles are endowed with a surface which yields high efficiency when used as an electrode, particularly when the reacted coated particles are used in an anode material in a rechargeable storage cell, particularly in a rechargeable Li-ion cell.<br>
Another preferred aspect of the present invention is in the graphitization step. The coated carbonaceous particles, also referred to herein as the composite particle powders or coated particle powders, are preferably carbonized/graphitized at temperatures higher than 2200 °C. This high temperature heat treatment after the oxidation results in both the very high capacity and charge efficiency for the coated particle powders. It is especially advantageous that nearly all of the high capacity of these graphitized materials occurs at a low potential of 0.0 to 0.5 volts.<br>
A further aspect of the invention contemplates the use of the carbonized and/or graphitized coated carbonaceous particles in electrodes, particularly anodes, of electrical storage cells, particularly in rechargeable batteries. According to this aspect of the invention, there is contemplated a method for the manufacture of an electrical storage cell which<br>
comprises the step of: incorporating into an anode of the electrical storage cell coated graphitic materials comprising coated fine carbonaceous particles having a coating layer formed of an oxidized, carbon residue forming material.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, the coated carbonaceous particles produced<br>
from the processes described above are formed using the conventional techniques into<br>
electrodes, particularly anodes. While not described with particularity herein, it is<br>
contemplated that known-art manufacturing techniques for the assemblage of such<br>
electrodes, as well as known-art devices which facilitate in the formation of such electrodes<br>
can be used. A particular advantage which is obtained by the use of the coated carbonaceous<br>
particles taught herein lies in the fact that due to their coating, they rarely fuse together thus<br>
resulting in a flowable powder. Such flowable powder not only facilitates in the transport of<br>
the coated carbonaceous materials, but also aids in the ultimate electrode as such provides a<br>
good degree of packing and uniformity. Such a good degree of packing of course very<br>
favorably impacts on the volumetric capacity of any battery, particularly a rechargeable<br>
battery of which these electrodes form a part, as an increased charge carrying capacity per<br>
unit volume of the electrode permits for the decrease in the overall size of a battery while<br>
maintaining good performance characteristics thereof.	Another aspect of the current<br>
invention is that the coated carbonaceous particles of this invention have a very high first cycle efficiency. This high efficiency is developed by the process of this invention. First cycle efficiency of the coated carbonaceous particles of this invention are typically &gt;90% when the carbon electrode is electrochemically cycled between 0 and 1 volts versus lithium metal. By comparison, first cycle efficiency is as low as 50% in the carbonaceous particles before coating and is typically 90% or less in coated particles produced by other techniques previously known in the art.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is an increase in gravimetric or specific capacity as a result of practicing the coating process. Specific capacity is typically increased by 2 to 5% in the graphitized coated particles of this invention.<br>
Aspects of the present invention, including certain preferred embodiments are described in the following Examples of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Electrochemical Test Procedure<br>
The electrical charge capacity, as well as the irreversible electrical charge capacity loss of the powder particles were evaluated by the following techniques.<br>
Samples of a powder particle (5 g) were first thoroughly mixed with 3.82 grams of a solution containing 0.382 g of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, ex. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) and 3.44 g of 1-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP, ex. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) solution to which was also added 0.082 g of acetylene black (having an effective surface area of 80 m2/g, ex. Alfa Aesar) in order to form uniform slurry. This slurry was then manually cast utilizing a doctor blade to form a thin film having a loading of about 10 mg/cm2onto the rough side of an electrodeposited copper foil (10 j-im, ex. Fuduka Metal Foil &amp; Powder Co., Ltd.) The cast film was then dried on a hot plate at approx. 100 °C and pressed to a desired density (approx. 1.4 g/cm) with a roll press. After the cast film was allowed to cool, a disc having an area of 1.5 cm was then punched out from the film and weighed to determine the amount of the graphite powder. Subsequently this disc was further dried under vacuum at a temperature of 80 °C for approximately 15 minutes, and then the disc was transferred into a sealed box without exposing the disc to ambient air. The sealed box was filled with ultra-pure argon gas having oxygen and moisture levels of less than 1 ppm.<br>
Subsequently the disc was used as the anode in the manufacture of a standard coin cell (2025 size) which was used as the test cell. The other electrode of the test cell was a foil of pure lithium (100 µm , ex. Alfa Aesar). A two layer separator was used in the test cell, a glass mat (GF/B Glass Microfibre Filter, Whatman International Ltd.) as the first layer on the carbon electrode side, and a porous polypropylene film (available as Celgard® 2300, ex. Celgard Inc.). as the second layer on the lithium foil. The electrolyte of the test cell was a 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solvent mixture (40/30/30) (available as specified by EM Industrial.) Test cells were produced utilizing the component described above according to conventional techniques, although the samples of powder particles were varied to ensure that at least one sample coin cell was produced incorporating a powder particle sample according to either one of the<br>
demonstrative examples, or according to one of the comparative examples. These powders were tested as the anode material in a coin cell configuration of carbon/separator/lithium metal at room temperature ( approx. 22 °C). Two or three cells were made for each sample, the reported charge capacity and charge efficiency were the average value of the cells. The capacity and charging efficiency of a specific powder particle sample was determined according to the following protocol. Utilizing a standard electrochemical test station (Model BT-2043, Arbin Instrument Corp.) an assembled test cell was first discharged at 1 mA (approx. 67 mA/g) to 0 volts and held at 0 volts for 2 hours or till current dropped to less than 50 uA whichever occurred first. Thereafter the assembled test cell was charged at 1 mA to 2 volts during which time the charge passed during charging was used to calculate the specific capacity of the graphite powder, while the ratio of the total charge passed during charging to the total charge passed during discharging was used to determine the first cycle efficiency.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A carbonaceous powder was prepared as follows. A "green" granular needle coke was first milled with a hammer mill, and subsequently milled into a fine powder with a jet mill. Subsequently, the resultant milled particles of carbonaceous material were classified to remove particles smaller than 1 (am. The resultant carbonaceous powder had particles sized in the range of between 0.5 µm and about 50 urn, and an average particle size of about 15-20 µm.<br>
To a laboratory beaker was provided 4 g of a low melting point petroleum pitch (a210°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, 
drying under vacuum at 120°C for at least 3 hours. Due to the differences in solubility of the pitch in Tetralin® as opposed to the solubility of pitch in a large volume of xylene at different temperatures, selective precipitation of a higher melting point pitch occured on the carbonaceous powder particles. The final weight of the dried coated carbonaceous powder particles was about 21.1 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the carbonaceous powder was determined from the following equation:<br>
(Final weight - initial weight) / Final Weight = amount of precipitated pitch<br>
Therefore, the amount of precipitated pitch on the carbonaceous powder was established to account for 5 wt% of the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles.<br>
A separate experiment was performed to determine the melting point and carbon residue yield of the coating produced by this Example. An identical solution of isotropic pitch in Tetralin® was added to an identical amount of xylene except that no carbonaceous particles were dispersed in the xylene. The pitch precipitate that formed had a melting point of 310°C and an Alcor carbon residue of 84%.<br>
Subsequently the coated carbonaceous powder was oxidized by thoroughly mixing the powder with 9 g of 1.5 wt% aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C and thereafter the dried mixture was transferred to 50 ml alumina crucibles and inserted into a vacuum furnace. The crucibles were then slowly heated under vacuum conditions from about ambient temperature to 325°C at a rate of 1°C /minute, at which point the crucibles were maintained under vacuum at 325°C for 2 hours. This slow heating step provided suitable oxidation reaction conditions whereby the deposited coating could be oxidized and stabilized prior to any further processing steps or handling, and permitted the pitch coating to form a better ordered molecular structure. Following this oxidation step, the stabilized coated carbonaceous powder particles could then be carbonized at still higher temperatures with little or no change in their morphology and with little or no likelihood of the melting of the coating layer.<br>
Although the stabilized coated carbonaceous powder particles could be used without further processing, according to preferred embodiments of the invention further process steps were practiced in order to ultimately graphitize the particles.<br>
Following the heat conditioning step at 325°C for 2 hours, the crucibles containing the stabilized coated carbonaceous powder particles were further heated in argon gas at a rate of 1 °C /minute to a temperature of 350°C at which point the crucibles were maintained at 350°C for 2 hours. Thereafter the crucibles containing the stabilized coaled carbonaceous powder particles were further heated at a rate of 1°C /minute to a temperature of 410 °C at which point the crucibles were maintained at this higher temperature for 2 hours. Subsequently the crucibles containing the stabilized coated carbonaceous powder particles were further heated at a rate of 5°C /minute to a temperature of 850°C at which point the crucibles were maintained at 850°C for 2 hours, after which heating of the oven was discontinued and the contents of the oven were allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C). Also, it is to be understood that stabilized coated carbonaceous powder particles could be used after one or more heat treatment steps and without further processing, but according to preferred embodiments of the invention the particles are ultimately graphitized.<br>
After the coated carbonaceous powder particles were cooled, they were graphitized by transferring them to a graphite crucible and then introducing the crucible to an induction furnace having an argon atmosphere, and first heating the crucible at a rate of 13°C/minute to a temperature of 2800°C and thereafter heating the crucibles at a rate of 5°C/minute to 3000°C at which time the temperature of the induction furnace was maintained at 3000°C for a period of 45 minutes, after which graphitization was believed to be essentially complete. Subsequently the graphitized coated carbonaceous powder particles were removed from the crucibles.<br>
The resultant powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability, and it did not appear that fusion of particles had taken place. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles was produced in accordance with the process steps described above with reference to Example 1. According to this example however, initially there was provided to the first laboratory beaker 8.5 g of the low melting point petroleum pitch described in Example 1, which was added to 8.5 g of Tetralin® (C10H12) at 140°C. The contents of the second laboratory beaker remained the same as in Example 1, but the resultant dried coated carbonaceous powder particles recovered exhibited a final dried weight of about 22.3 grams. Based on this information, the coating on the coated carbonaceous powder particles was determined to be about 10 wt. % based on the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles. These dried particles were subsequently thoroughly mixed with 9 g of 3.8 wt % aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C. The dried mixture was subsequently oxidized, and heat treated in accordance with the steps described in Example 1, until graphitized coated carbonaceous powder particles were obtained. The graphitized powder particles of Example 2 demonstrated good powder flowability, and it did not appear that fusion of particles had taken place. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles was produced in accordance with the process steps described above with reference to Example 1. According to this example however, there was provided 10 g of the low melting point petroleum pitch described in Example 1, which was added to 10 g of Tetralin® (C10H12) at 140°C in the first laboratory beaker. The contents of the second laboratory beaker remained the same as in Example 1, but the resultant dried coated carbonaceous powder particles recovered exhibited a final dried weight of about 22.7 grams. Based on this information, the coating on the coated carbonaceous powder particles was determined to be about 12 wt. % based on the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles. These dried particles were then subsequently thoroughly mixed with 9 g of 4.5 wt % aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under<br>
vacuum at 80°C. The dried mixture was subsequently oxidized, and heat treated in accordance with the steps described in Example 1, until graphitized coated carbonaceous powder particles were obtained. The resultant powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability, and it did not appear that fusion of particles had taken place. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles was produced in accordance with the process steps described above with reference to Example 1. According to this example however, to the first laboratory beaker was provided 15 g of the low melting point petroleum pitch of Example 1, and 15 g of Tetralin® (C10H12) at 140°C. The contents of the second laboratory beaker remained the same as in Example 1, but the resultant dried coated carbonaceous powder particles recovered exhibited a final dried weight of about 24 grams. Based on this information, the coating on the coated carbonaceous powder particles was determined to be about 17 wt. % based on the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles. These dried particles were then subsequently thoroughly mixed with 10 g of 6.0 wt % aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C. The dried mixture was subsequently oxidized, and heat treated in accordance with the steps described in Example 1, until graphitized coated carbonaceous powder particles were obtained. The resultant powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability, and it did not appear that fusion of particles had taken place. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles was produced in accordance with the process steps described above with reference to Example 1. According to this example however, to the first laboratory beaker was provided 20 g of the low melting point petroleum pitch of Example 1, and 20 g of Tetralin® (C10H12) at 140°C. The contents of the second laboratory beaker remained the same as in Example 1, but the resultant dried<br>
coated carbonaceous powder particles recovered exhibited a final dried weight of about 25.3 grams. Based on this information, the coating on the coated carbonaceous powder particles was determined to be about 21 wt. % based on the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles. These dried particles were then subsequently thoroughly mixed with 10 g of 8 wt% aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C. The dried mixture was subsequently oxidized, and heat treated in accordance with the steps described in Example 1, until graphitized coated carbonaceous powder particles were obtained. The resultant powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability, and it did not appeai' that fusion of particles had taken place. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
As a comparative example, the same milled green needle coke carbonaceous powder of Example 1 was graphitized and tested as an anode carbon in a lithium ion battery. This comparative example demonstrated the use of uncoated graphitized carbonaceous powder particles.<br>
Graphitization of these uncoated carbonaceous powder particles was achieved by transferring them to a graphite crucible, inserting the crucible into an induction furnace having an argon atmosphere, and first heating the crucible at a rate of 13°C/minute to a temperature of 2800°C and thereafter heating the crucible at a rate of 5°C/minute to 3000°C at which time the temperature of the induction furnace was maintained at 3000°C for a period of 45 minutes. Subsequent to these heating steps graphitization was believed to be essentially complete. The crucibles containing the uncoated carbonaceous powder particles was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature, after which the powder particles were removed from the crucibles. The resultant uncoated powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Comparative Example are shown in Table 1 following Comparative Example 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
As a further comparison example there were utilized 20 grams of "as-milled" uncoated "green" carbonaceous particles, which were mixed in a laboratory beaker with 9 g of a 1.5 wt% aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C and thereafter the dried mixture was then provided to alumina crucibles and inserted into a vacuum furnace. These samples were subsequently subjected to the same heat treatment steps as outlined in Example 1, namely, heated under vacuum conditions from about ambient temperature to 325°C at a rate of 1 °C /minute, and thereafter maintained under vacuum at 325°C for 2 hours. Next, the particles were further heated under argon at a rate of 1°C /minute to 350°C, and thereafter maintained at 350°C for 2 hours and subsequently heated at a rate of 1°C /minute to a temperature of 410 °C and thereafter maintained under vacuum for 2 hours. Subsequently the crucibles containing these uncoated carbonaceous powder were further heated under argon at a rate of 5°C /minute to a temperature of 850°C and then maintained at 850°C for 2 hours, after which heating was discontinued, the contents of the oven were allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 20°C).<br>
Graphitization of these uncoated carbonaceous powder particles was achieved by the same process described above with reference to Comparative Ex. 1. Again, the resultant uncoated powder particles demonstrated good powder flowability. The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Comparative Example are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1 reports the results for the seven samples of powder particles prepared according to each of Examples 1-5 and Comparative Examples 1-2 as determined using the Electrical Test Procedure described at the beginning of the Examples.<br>
(Table removed)<br>
It can be seen that the first cycle efficiency was greatly improved from 50% to 96% when the amount of coated pitch was increased to 10 wt %. The results also show that the efficiency does not increase further when it reaches about 96%. In addition, the materials treated according to this invention yield a higher capacity than those that were not treated.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles according to the invention was produced utilizing a commercially available milled natural graphite powder having particles sized less than 44 urn. (available as KS-44, ex. Lonza). To a first laboratory beaker was provided 8.5 g of a low melting point petroleum pitch (a 210°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, 
temperature (approx. 20°C). The resultant solids were removed from the cooled mixture by first filtering the mixture on a vacuum funnel, and thereafter drying under vacuum at 120°C for at least 3 hours. As discussed in Example 1, due to the differences in solubility of the pitch in Tetralin® as opposed to the solubility of pitch in xylene at different temperatures, selective precipitation resulted in precipitation and deposition of higher melting point pitch on the carbonaceous powder particles. The final weight of the dried coated carbonaceous powder particles was determined to be about 22.3 g, while the amount of precipitated pitch on the carbonaceous powder was determined to be l0wt. % of the total mass of the coated carbonaceous powder particles.<br>
Subsequently the dried coated carbonaceous powder particles were thoroughly mixed with 9 g of 3.8 wt% aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T.Baker, Inc.) The mixture was subsequently dried under vacuum at 80°C. The dried mixture was subsequently subjected to the same heat treatment steps as outlined in Example 1, namely, heated under vacuum conditions from about ambient temperature to 325°C at a rate of 1°C /minute, and thereafter maintained under vacuum at 325°C for 2 hours. Next, the particles were further heated under argon at a rate of 1°C /minute to 350°C, and thereafter maintained at 350°C for 2 hours and subsequently heated at a rate of 1°C /minute to a temperature of 410°C and thereafter maintained for 2 hours. Subsequently the crucibles containing the coated carbonaceous powder were further heated at a rate of 5°C /minute to a temperature of 850°C and then maintained at 850°C for 2 hours, after which heating was discontinued and the contents of the oven were allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C).<br>
Graphitization of these coated carbonaceous powder particles was achieved by transferring them to a graphite crucible, inserting the crucible into an induction furnace having an argon atmosphere, and first heating the crucible at a rate of 13°C/minute to a temperature of 2800°C and thereafter heating the crucible at a rate of 5°C/minute to 3000°C at which time the temperature of the induction furnace was maintained at 3000°C for a period of 45 minutes. Subsequent to these heating steps graphitization was believed to be essentially complete. The crucible containing the coated carbonaceous powder particles was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C), after which the powder particles were removed from the crucible. The resultant powder particles exhibited good flowability.<br>
The results of electrochemical testing of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 2 following Comparative Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A further sample of coated carbonaceous powder particles according to the invention was produced utilizing particles derived from a calcined petroleum needle coke (calcining temperature 1100 °C) having particles sized in the range of between lµm and about 50µm, and an average particle size of about 20 µm. Similarly to the process described in Example 6, to a first laboratory beaker was provided 8.5 g of a low melting point petroleum pitch (a 210°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue,

mixture was subsequently were subjected to the same stabilization, carbonization and graphitization steps as outlined in Example 6., The resultant powder particles exhibited good flowability. The results of electrochemical testmg of the graphite powder of this Example are shown in Table 2 following Comparative Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Coated carbonaceous powder particles were produced utilizing a milled "green" petroleum needle coke having particles sized in the range of between lµm and about 50µm, and an average particle size of about 20 pm. Similarly to the process described in Example 6, to a first laboratory beaker was provided 10 g of a low melting point petroleum pitch (a 210°C Mettler softemng point, 75% Alcor carbon residue,

The recovered carbonaceous powder particles were observed to have conglomerated into a single cake, which was withdrawn from the crucible and first crushed into smaller pieces and then ball milled into a powder form.<br>
Graphitization of these coated carbonaceous powder particles was achieved by next transferring them to a graphite crucible, inserting the crucible into an induction furnace having an argon atmosphere, and first heating the crucible at a rate of 13°C/minute to a temperature of 2800°C and thereafter heating the crucible at a rate of 5°C/minute to 3000°C at which time the temperature of the induction furnace was maintained at 3000°C for a period of 45 minutes.

The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 17 with the exception that 750 ml of xylene were used in the washing step. The total weight of the resulting powder was 564 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the coke powder was about 17 wt%.<br>
The dried powder was mixed thoroughly with 225 g of a 6.4 wt% aqueous solution of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T. Baker). The mixture was dried under vacuum at 80°C. After drying, 44 grams of the oxidant-coated powder were set aside for use in Example 24 and 510 grams of the powder were stabilized, carbonized and graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 13.<br>
EXAMPLE 24 This example illustrates that a separate carbonization step is not required prior to graphitization..   Forty-four grams of the oxidant-coated powder prepared in Example 23 were heated to 450°C for two hours in an argon environment and then cooled to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C). The stabilized powder was then transferred to a graphite crucible and graphitized by heating to 3000°C in an induction furnace under argon as described in Example 17, The resulting powder was tested as described in the<br>
Electrochemical Test Procedure and the results are given in Table 13).<br>
EXAMPLE 25<br>
Spherical graphite particles were coated with the petroleum pitch used in Example 17. The graphite particles were a commercial mesophase carbon microbead (MCMB) powder (available as MCMB-6-28 from Osaka Gas Co. LTD, Japan).<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 7.5 grams of the low melting petroleum pitch described in Example 17 (a 193°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, low ash isotropic petroleum pitch) in 7.5 grams of xylene (A.C.S. reagent, ex. Fisher Scientific) at 90°C in a 50 ml glass flask. In parallel, 20 grams MCMB powder and 150 ml of xylene were heated to 138°C in a 500 ml glass flask with continuous stirring. The pitch-xylene solution was gradually poured into the MCMB powder suspension while the mixture was continuously stirred. The mixture was subsequently heated to 138°C and continuously stirred for 15 minutes. Subsequently the heat source was removed, and while continuous stirring was maintained, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C). The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 17. The total weight of the resulting powder was 21.9 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the MCMB powder was about 8.7 wt%.<br>
The dried powder was mixed thoroughly with 6 g of a 4.8 wt% aqueous solution sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T. Baker). The mixture was dried, stabilized, carbonized and graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 13.<br>
EXAMPLE 26 The coating procedure described in Example 17 was conducted using toluene as the solvent instead of xylene.<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 11 g of the pitch used in Example 17 in 11 g of toluene at 90°C in a 50 ml glass flask. In parallel, 20 g of the calcined needle coke powder used in Example 18 and 150 ml of xylene were heated to 90°C in a 1000 ml glass flask with continuous stirring. The pitch-toluene solution was gradually poured into the coke powder suspension while the mixture was continuously stirred. The mixture was<br>
subsequently heated to 100°C and continuously stirred for 15 minutes. Subsequently the heat source was removed, and while continuous stirring was maintained, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C). The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 17, with the exception that 200 ml of toluene were used in the washing step and that the sample was dried at 100°C. The total weight of the resulting powder was 22.6 g.   The amount of precipitated pitch on the coke powder was calculated as described in Example 17 to be about 11.5 wt%.<br>
The resulted pitch-coated powder was transferred into a 50 ml alumina crucible and then placed in a tube furnace and heated at l°C/minutes to 300°C and subsequently held at 300°C for 10 hours under an absolute pressure of 200 mm of mercury (26.7 kPa). There is sufficient oxygen present at 200 mm of mercury (26.7 kPa) to stabilize the oxidant coated particles during the heat and hold cycles. Subsequently, the coated particles were carbonized and graphitized in the same way as described in example 17. (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T. Baker).   The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 13.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 8<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 60 g of the heat soaked petroleum pitch used in Example 19 in 40 g of xylene (ACS reagent, ex. Fisher Scientific) in a 100 ml glass beaker and heating to 80 °C in a water bath. The solvent to pitch ratio was about 2 to 1. In parallel, 20 g of the calcined coke powder described in Example 18 and 80 g of xylene were heated to 80°C in a 200 ml glass beaker with continuous stirring. The pitch-xylene solution was gradually poured into the coke powder suspension while the mixture was continuously stirred. Subsequently the heat source was removed, and while continuous stirring was maintained, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C) The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 18 with the exception that 30 g of xylene were used in the washing step. The total weight of the resulting powder was 20.5 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the coke powder was about 2 wt %.<br>
The dried powder was transferred into a 50 ml alumina crucible, placed in a tube furnace, and heated slowly at l°C/minute to 300°C under about 100 torr (13.3 kPa) air pressure and held at 300 °C for 10 hours. The tube furnace was then purged with pure<br>
nitrogen gas, and the powder was carbonized as described in Example 17. The carbonized particles were subsequently graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 13. The results demonstrates that coke particles that were not sufficiently coated with the pitch material resulted in poor charge efficiency.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 9<br>
In a 50 ml glass beaker 2.5 g of a mesophase pitch powder (Mettler softening point approx. 410°C, made by Conoco, Inc.) and 50 g of xylene (ACS reagent, ex. Fisher Scientific) were heated at 90°C. The pitch was only slightly soluble in xylene. In a parallel step, 15 g of the same green needle coke powder as used in Example 17 and 150 ml of xylene were heated to 160°C in a 500 ml stainless steel pressure vessel with continuous stirring. The mesophase-xylene solution was injected into the coke powder suspension while the mixture was continuously stirred. The mixture was then further heated to 290°C and was continuously stirred for 15 minutes. Subsequently the heat source was removed, and while continuous stirring was maintained, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 20°C) The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 17, with the exception that 30 g of xylene were used in the washing step. The total weight of the resulting powder was 16.8 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the coke powder was about 10.7 wt%. However, it was observed that rather than coating the coke particles, the mesophase pitch was in the form of separate fine particles.<br>
The dried powder was mixed thoroughly with 6 g of an aqueous 4.5 wt% solution of sodium nitrate (A.C.S. reagent, ex. J.T. Baker). The mixture was dried, stabilized, carbonized and graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 13.<br>

EXAMPLE 33 Natural graphite flake (Nashu, China) was milled with a jet mill and classified in air. The resulting powder had particles sized in the range of between 0.1 and about 40 µm, and an average particle size of about 12 µm. Twenty grams of the resulting powder was suspended in 150 cc of xylene. A solution of 11 g of the low melting petroleum pitch described in Example 17 (a 193°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, low ash isotropic pitch) dissolved in 11 g of xylene was added to the suspension of graphite particles.

EXAMPLE 34<br>
A coated natural graphite powder was prepared using the same particles as described<br>
in Example 33. Twenty grams of the powder were suspended in 150 cc of xylene. A<br>
solution of 14 g of the low melting petroleum pitch described in Example 17 (a 193°C<br>

EXAMPLE 35<br>
This example demonstrates the use of a fluidized bed reactor in the stabilization step and air as the oxidation/stabilization agent.<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 320 g of the low melting point pitch used in Example 17 (a 193°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, low ash isotropic petroleum pitch) in 320 g of xylene at 100 °C in a 500 ml glass flask. In parallel, 540 g of the milled, calcined needle coke powder used in Example 18 and 1280 ml of xylene were heated to 120 °C in a 6 liter stainless steel vessel with continuous stirring. The pitch/xylene solution was gradually poured into the coke powder suspension while the mixture was continuously stirred. The mixture was subsequently heated to 160°C under ambient pressure and continuously stirred for 15 minutes. Subsequently the heat source was removed, and while continuous stirring was maintained, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C) The resultant solids were separated, washed and dried as described in Example 17 with the exception that 700 ml of xylene were used in the washing step. The total weight of the resulting powder was 622 g. The amount of precipitated pitch on the coke powder was about 13.2 wt%.<br>
The dried powder was gently sieved through a 120 mesh (125 urn) sieve. One hundred grams of the sieved powder was weighed and placed into a stainless steel laboratory fluidized bed reactor [in-house designed, reactor chamber size: 5 inch (12.7 cm) diameter and 4.5 inch (11.4 cm) high]. The reactor was placed into a heated sand bath that had been preheated to 150°C. The inlet air and the sand bath temperatures were increased to 275°C at a rate if 6°C/minute and held at 275 °C for 15 minutes. The reactor then was removed from the sand bath, and the inlet gas was shifted to nitrogen gas so that the stabilized powder and the reactor could cool to ambient temperature (approx. 22°C).<br>
Fifty grams of the stabilized powder were placed in an alumina crucible. The crucible was placed in a tube furnace and heated at a rate of 5°C/minute to 850°C in pure nitrogen, held at 850°C for 2 hours, and then cooled at a rate of 5°C/minute to ambient<br>
temperature (approx. 22°C). The powder was transferred into a graphite crucible and<br>
graphitized in an induction furnace as described in Example 17. The graphitized powder was tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 15.<br>
EXAMPLES 36-38<br>
These examples demonstrate the effect of different stabilization temperature profiles. One hundred grams of the pitch-coated powder produced by the procedure described in Example 35 were used in each of the examples.<br>
In Example 36, the sand bath was pre-heated to 200°C prior to dropping the reactor into the sand bath. The sand bath and the inlet air were heated at a rate of 6°C/minute to 275°C<br>
In Example 37, the sand bath was pre-heated to 230°C prior to dropping the reactor into the sand bath.   The sand bath and the inlet air were heated at a rate of 6°C/minute to to 300°C and held for 15 minutes, hi Example 38, the sand bath was pre-heated to 280°C. After the reactor was dropped into the sand bath, the temperature at the gas outlet rapidly increased to 400°C. The inlet gas was quickly shifted to nitrogen gas, and the reactor was pulled out of the sand bath and allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
Fifty grams of each of the air-stabilized powders were transferred into separate graphite crucibles and carbonized and graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powders were tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 15.<br>
EXAMPLES 39-42 These examples demonstrate the effect of eliminating the step of carbonizing the stabilized coated particles prior to graphitization.<br>
Examples 39-42 used the air-stabilized powders produced by the processes described in Examples 35-38, respectively. Following stabilization, the powders were transferred into separate graphite crucibles and graphitized as described in Example 17. The graphitized powders were tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are given in Table 15. The data for each of the examples shows that the graphite powders all had charge efficiencies of greater than 93%.<br>
(Table removed)<br>
EXAMPLES 43-45<br>
A first solution was prepared by dissolving 65 g of the same petroleum pitch as used in Example 1 (a 210°C Mettler softening point, 75% Alcor carbon residue, 
The stabilized coated particles were then either directly graphitized at 3000°C (Example 43), carbonized at 1200°C (Example 44), or carbonized at 900°C (Example 45).<br>
The powders produced by Examples 43-45 were tested using the Electrochemical Test Procedure, and the results are shown in Table 16.<br>
The cell voltage versus lithium was also measured as a function of the discharge, capacity for each of these materials (Figure 1). The data shows that although the overall capacity of Example 43 and Example 45 were nearly the same within the potential window of 0 to 2 volts, the capacity distribution at different electrode potentials was quite different. The potential increased sharply after 0.5 volts for Example 43, whereas it increased slowly with a fairly large shoulder after 0.5 volts for Example 45. Example 43 also had a higher practical capacity and a higher charge efficiency than Example 45. If the cut-off potential for the anode material is 0.5 volts versus Li, the remaining capacity at the potential above 0.5 volts would not be seen in a practical device.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the initial charge efficiency and the cutoff potential for the materials prepared in Examples 43-45. The data indicates that the initial chaige efficiency of Example 45 strongly depended on the cut-off potential. For Example 45 the charge efficiency was 82% at the cut-off potential of 0.5 volts, whereas that of Example 43 increased less than 2% from 0.5 to 2 volts.<br>
Examples 43-45 illustrate that the carbonization/graphitization temperature has a significant effect on both the capacity and efficiency of the pitch-coated graphite particle powder. At a low temperature such as 900°C (
