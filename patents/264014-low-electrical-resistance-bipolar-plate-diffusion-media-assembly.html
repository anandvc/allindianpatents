				<td>LOW ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE BIPOLAR PLATE-<br>
DIFFUSION MEDIA ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a fuel cell stack system and more<br>
particularly to a fuel cell assembly and a method of preparing the<br>
same, adapted to minimize an electrical resistance within the fuel cell<br>
system, the fuel cell assembly including a membrane electrode<br>
assembly having a plurality of diffusion media adhered to a plurality of<br>
bipolar plates with an electrically conductive adhesive layer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel cell stack systems (hereinafter fuel cells) are increasingly<br>
being used as a power source for electric vehicles and other<br>
applications. Different fuel cell types can be provided such as<br>
phosphoric acid, alkaline, molten carbonate, solid oxide, and proton<br>
exchange membrane (PEM), for example.<br>
[0003] In proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, a hydrogen gas<br>
reactant is supplied as a fuel to an anode side of the fuel cell and an<br>
oxygen gas reactant is supplied as an oxidant to a cathode side of the<br>
fuel cell. The reaction that occurs between the reactant gases in the<br>
fuel cell consumes the hydrogen at the anode side and produces<br>
product water at the cathode side.<br>
[0004] The basic components of a PEM-type fuel cell are two<br>
electrodes separated by a polymer membrane electrolyte. Each<br>
electrode is coated on one side with a thin catalyst layer. The<br>
electrodes, catalyst, and membrane together form a membrane<br>
electrode assembly (MEA). The MEA is typically sandwiched between<br>
"anode" and "cathode" diffusion media or diffusion layers that are<br>
formed from a resilient, conductive, and gas permeable material such<br>
as carbon fabric or paper. The diffusion media serve as the primary<br>
current collectors for the anode and cathode as well as providing<br><br>
mechanical support for the MEA.<br>
[0005] The diffusion media and MEA are pressed between a pair of<br>
electronically conductive plates which serve as secondary current<br>
collectors for collecting the current from the primary current collectors.<br>
The plates conduct current between adjacent cells internally of the<br>
fuel cell stack in the case of bipolar plates and conduct current<br>
externally of the stack in the case of unipolar plates at the end of the<br>
stack.<br>
[0006] The bipolar plates typically include two thin, facing metal<br>
sheets. One of the sheets defines a flow path on one outer surface<br>
thereof for delivery of the fuel to the anode of the MEA. An outer<br>
surface of the other sheet defines a flow path for the oxidant for<br>
delivery to the cathode side of the MEA. When the sheets are joined,<br>
a flow path for a dielectric cooling fluid is defined. The plates are<br>
typically produced from a formable metal that provides suitable<br>
strength, electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance, such as 316<br>
alloy stainless steel, for example.<br>
[0007] The fuel cell stack, which may contain more than one hundred<br>
plates, is compressed, and the elements held together by bolts<br>
through corners of the stack and anchored to frames at the ends of<br>
the stack. In order to militate against undesirable leakage of fluids<br>
from between the pairs of plates, a seal or gasket is often used. The<br>
seal is typically disposed along a peripheral edge of the pairs of<br>
plates. Prior art seals have included the use of an elastomeric<br>
material. Additional prior art seals have included the use of a metal<br>
seal, such as disclosed in published Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)<br>
Pat. Appl. No. PCT/EP2003/011347, hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
[0008] Efficient operation of PEM fuel cells may depend on an amount<br>
of electrical resistance present in the system, and more particularly to<br>
the electrical resistance at an interface between the bipolar plates and<br>
the diffusion media of the MEA.<br>
[0009] It is desirable to produce a fuel cell adapted to minimize<br>
electrical resistance between the bipolar plates and the MEA of a fuel<br><br>
cell assembly to optimize system performance. In the fuel cell<br>
described herein, efficient operation of the fuel cell is maximized by<br>
adhering diffusion media adjacent a membrane electrode assembly to<br>
adjacent bipolar plates with an electrically conductive adhesive layer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] Concordant and congruous with the present invention, a<br>
diffusion media adapted to optimize water management while<br>
maximizing the performance of the fuel cell has surprisingly been<br>
discovered.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment, a fuel cell assembly comprises a<br>
membrane electrode assembly including a membrane disposed<br>
between a plurality of catalyst layers; a plurality of diffusion media,<br>
each having a microporous layer disposed on a side thereof, wherein<br>
the side of said diffusion media having the microporous layer is<br>
adhered to the catalyst layers of said membrane electrode assembly;<br>
a first bipolar plate; a second bipolar plate; and an electrically<br>
conductive adhesive layer disposed on at least a portion of said first<br>
bipolar plate and said second bipolar plate, wherein said adhesive<br>
layer adheres said first bipolar plate to one of said diffusion media<br>
and said second bipolar plate to another of said diffusion media to<br>
minimize an electrical contact resistance between said diffusion media<br>
and said first and second bipolar plates.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, a fuel cell stack comprises a plurality of<br>
membrane electrode assemblies, each including a membrane<br>
disposed between a plurality of catalyst layers; a plurality of diffusion<br>
media, wherein one of said plurality of diffusion media is adjacent<br>
each side of said membrane electrode assemblies; a pluralrty of<br>
bipolar plates, each of said bipolar plates having a perimeter portion,<br>
wherein each of said bipolar plates is disposed between two of said<br>
membrane electrode assemblies; a sealant disposed in a void formed<br>
by the perimeter portions of said bipolar plates, wherein said sealant<br>
forms a seal between said first bipolar plate, said second bipolar<br>
plate, and said membrane electrode assembly; and an electrically<br><br>
conductive adhesive layer disposed on at least a portion of a first<br>
bipolar and a second bipolar plate, wherein said adhesive layer<br>
adheres the first bipolar plate to one of said diffusion media and said<br>
second bipolar plate to another of said diffusion media to minimize an<br>
electrical contact resistance between said diffusion media and the first<br>
and the second bipolar plates.<br>
[0013] In another embodiment, a method for making a fuel cell assembly<br>
for use in a PEM fuel cell, comprises the steps of providing a plurality of<br>
bipolar plates, each plate having a first working face and a second<br>
working face; providing an electrically conductive adhesive layer on<br>
the first working face and the second working face of the bipolar<br>
plates; providing a membrane electrode assembly having a membrane<br>
disposed between catalyst layers; coating a diffusion media with a<br>
paste to form a microporous layer thereon; sintering the diffusion<br>
media and microporous layers together; adhering the microporous<br>
layers of the diffusion media to the catalyst layers of the membrane<br>
electrode assembly; adhering the catalyst layers and the proton<br>
exchange membrane; adhering the diffusion media to the first working<br>
face of one of the bipolar plates with the adhesive layer and adhering<br>
another diffusion media to the first working face of another bipolar<br>
plate with the adhesive layer.<br>

critical.<br>
[0019] Fig. 1 illustrates a fuel cell stack 10 including two fuel cell assemblies<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention, however, it is understood that<br>
any number of fuel cell assemblies and bipolar plates may be used in a<br>
typical fuel cell stack, as desired. The fuel cell stack 10 is a two cell PEM<br>
fuel cell stack 10 having a pair of membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs)<br>
56, 57 separated by an electrically conductive fluid distribution element 52,<br>
hereinafter a bipolar plate 52. The MEAs 56, 57 and bipolar plate 52 are<br>
stacked together between end plates 16, 18, and end contact elements 20,<br>
22. The bipolar plate 52 and the end contact elements 20, 22 include<br>
working faces 26, 28, 24, 30, respectively, for distributing fuel and oxidant<br>
gases (e.g., H2 and O2) to the MEAs 56, 57. Nonconductive gaskets 32<br>
provide seals and electrical insulation between the several components of<br>
the fuel cell stack 10.<br>
[0020] The MEAs 56, 57 are disposed adjacent gas permeable conductive<br>
materials known as gas diffusion media. The gas diffusion media may<br>
include carbon or graphite diffusion paper. As described herein, the gas<br>
diffusion media are adhered to the MEAs 56, 57. The end contact units 20,<br>
22 contact the diffusion media of the MEAs 56, 57. The bipolar plate 52<br>
contacts the diffusion media on the anode face of the MEA 56, configured to<br>
accept a hydrogen-bearing reactant, and also contacts gas diffusion media<br>
on the cathode face of MEA 57, configured to accept an oxygen-bearing<br>
reactant. Oxygen is supplied to the cathode side of the fuel cell stack 10<br>
from an oxygen source 46, for example, via an appropriate supply conduit<br>
42. Hydrogen is supplied to the anode side of the fuel cell from a hydrogen<br>
source 48, for example, via an appropriate supply conduit 44. Alternatively,<br>
ambient air may be supplied to the cathode side as an oxygen source and<br><br>
hydrogen to the anode from a methanol or gasoline reformer, and the like.<br>
Exhaust conduits (not shown) for both the anode and the cathode sides of<br>
the MEAs 56, 57 are also provided. Additional conduits 36, 38, 40 are<br>
provided for supplying liquid coolant to the bipolar plate 52 and the end<br>
plates 16, 18. Appropriate conduits for exhausting coolant from the bipolar<br>
plate 52 and end plates 16, 18 are also provided (not shown).<br>
[0021] Referring next to Fig. 2, a fuel cell assembly 50 is shown including a<br>
bipolar plate 52 illustrated in Fig. 1 and a second bipolar plate 54. The fuel<br>
cell assembly 50 includes a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 56<br>
disposed between a plurality of diffusion media 55, one of the diffusion<br>
media 55 disposed between the MEA 56 and the first bipolar plate 52 and<br>
another of the diffusion media 55 disposed between the MEA 56, and the<br>
second bipolar plate 54.<br>
[0022] The MEA 56 is disposed intermediate the diffusion media 55 and<br>
includes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 78 disposed between two<br>
catalyst layers 80. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the PEM 78 is a thin,<br>
solid polymer membrane-electrolyte but may be any conventional PEM, as<br>
desired. The catalyst layers 80 are formed from platinum supported on high-<br>
structure carbon in the illustrated embodiment, but may be any convention<br>
catalyst such as a platinum-ruthenium catalyst, for example, as desired.<br>
[0023] One of the diffusion media 55 is disposed between a side of the MEA<br>
56 and the first bipolar plate 52 and another of the diffusion media 55 is<br>
disposed between another side of the MEA 56 and the second bipolar plate<br>
54. The MEA 56 includes a first side 72 and a second side 74. A<br>
microporous layer 76 is disposed on the second side 74 of the diffusion<br>
media 55 between the diffusion media 55 and the MEA 56. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the diffusion media 55 are carbon fiber paper such as<br>
the MRC U-105 paper produced by Mitsubishi Rayon Company. It is<br>
understood that the diffusion media 55 may also be a carbon cloth or other<br>
conventional material adapted to be electrically and thermally conductive.<br>
Furthermore, the diffusion media 55 may be untreated or treated on the<br>
second side 74 with a fluorocarbon polymer, as desired. The microporous<br>
layers 76 are formed from a carbon powder and fluorocarbon polymer<br><br>
mixture and may be formed from any conventional carbon ink or carbon<br>
paste, as desired.<br>
[0024] The first bipolar plate 52 and the second bipolar plate 54 are formed<br>
from a first unipolar plate 60 and a second unipolar plate 62, and each plate<br>
52, 54 includes the first working face 26 and the second working face 28.<br>
Each of the working faces 26, 28 includes a plurality of flow channels 64<br>
adapted to distribute the fuel and oxidant gases across the working faces<br>
26, 28 of the bipolar plates 52, 54. The plurality of flow channels 64 defines<br>
a plurality of lands 66 disposed therebetween.<br>
[0025] Further, the unipolar plates 60, 62 cooperate to form a flow path 68<br>
intermediate the lands 66 of the unipolar plates 60, 62. The flow path 68 is<br>
adapted to facilitate a distribution of a dielectric cooling fluid through the<br>
bipolar plates 52, 54. Any number of flow paths 68 may be formed by the<br>
unipolar plates 60, 62, as desired. In the embodiment shown, the unipolar<br>
plates 60, 62 of the bipolar plates 52, 54 are coupled together with fused tin<br>
70. However, the unipolar plates 60, 62 may be coupled by any conventional<br>
means such as with a b-stage adhesive or by weld-adhering, for example, or<br>
the bipolar plates 52, 54 may be formed from a single piece of material, as<br>
desired. In the embodiment shown, the bipolar plates 52, 54 are formed<br>
from 316 stainless steel, but may be formed from any conventional material<br>
such as graphite, for example. It is understood that the flow channels 64<br>
may be linear, substantially undulated, serpentine, or may have any other<br>
configuration, as desired.<br>
[0026] An adhesive layer 58 is disposed on the flow channels 64 and lands<br>
66 of each of the bipolar plates 52, 54. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
adhesive layers 58 are adjacent the second sides 74 of the diffusion media<br>
55 and are formed by an electrically conductive b-stage adhesive. The<br>
adhesive layers 58 couple the lands 66 of the bipolar plates 52, 54 to the<br>
first sides 72 of the diffusion media 55. The adhesive layers 58 may be<br>
formed from any electrically conductive material, as desired. The adhesive<br>
layers 58 may also be a conductive thermoplastic adhesive, or a combined<br>
conductive primer and conductive adhesive.<br>
[0027] To assemble the fuel cell assembly 50 shown in Fig. 2, the first<br>
unipolar plate 60 is adhered to the second unipolar plate 62 to form the<br><br>
bipolar plates 52, 54. The first unipolar plate 60 may be adhered to the<br>
second unipolar plate 62 by any conventional adhering means such as spot<br>
welding, laser welding, adhesive, or soldering, for example, as desired. The<br>
first unipolar plate 60 is adhered to the second unipolar plate 62 to minimize<br>
interfacial electrical resistance through the bipolar plates 52, 54. It is<br>
understood that the bipolar plates 52, 54 may be formed from a single,<br>
integrally formed plate, as desired. The working faces 26, 28 of the bipolar<br>
plates 52, 54 are treated with a primer to facilitate improved adhering of the<br>
adhesive layer 58 and unipolar plates 60, 62. The primer may be an acid<br>
primer, an alkaline primer, or a self-etching adhesive layer, as desired. The<br>
adhesive layer 58 is disposed on the flow channels 64 and the lands 66 of<br>
the working faces 26, 28 of the bipolar plates 52, 54. The adhesive layer 58<br>
may be disposed on the bipolar plates 52, 54 by any conventional method<br>
such as pressed on or sprayed on, for example, as desired. Also, when the<br>
unipolar plates 60, 62 are formed from a metal, the adhesive layer 58 may<br>
be applied to the metal during a coil coating process and prior to a stamping<br>
process that forms the unipolar plates 60, 62. It is understood that if the<br>
bipolar plates 52, 54 are formed from a polymeric material, the adhesive<br>
layer 58 may be applied directly to the bipolar plates 52, 54 without applying<br>
a primer, or the polymeric bipolar plates 52, 54 may receive a corona<br>
discharge treatment or radio frequency glow discharge treatment to facilitate<br>
improved adhering of the adhesive layer 58 to the bipolar plates 52, 54.<br>
[0028] The diffusion media 55, the microporous layers 76, the PEM 78, and<br>
the catalyst layers 80 are assembled together. A paste (not shown) is<br>
formed containing a mixture of a carbon powder and fluorocarbon polymers,<br>
applied to the second side 74 of the diffusion media 55, and sintered at or<br>
near 380°C to cause the diffusion media 55 and the microporous layer 76 to<br>
adhere. Commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 7,063,913 is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference to further describe methods for preparing<br>
the paste and other materials and processes used in preparing the diffusion<br>
media 55. The microporous layer 76 is adhered to a first face of the catalyst<br>
layer 80 with a self-blocking mechanism by heating the diffusion media 55,<br>
the microporous layer 76, and the catalyst layer 80 at or near 130°C. A<br>
second face of the catalyst layer 80 is adhered to a first side of the PEM 78.<br><br>
A second diffusion media 55, microporous layer 76, and catalyst layer 80<br>
assembly is prepared as described above and adhered to a second side of<br>
the PEM 78. One of the diffusion media 55 is pressed against the adhesive<br>
layer 58 of the bipolar plate 52 and the other diffusion media 55 is pressed<br>
against the adhesive layer 58 of the second bipolar plate 54. Once<br>
assembled, the fuel cell assembly 50 may be heated to facilitate an<br>
improved adhesion of the MEA 56 and bipolar plates 52, 54.<br>
[0029] In use, hydrogen is supplied to the end contact element 22 and the<br>
anode side of the bipolar plate 52 of the fuel cell stack 10 from the hydrogen<br>
source 48. Oxygen is supplied as the oxidant to the end contact element 20<br>
and the cathode side of the bipolar plate 52 from the oxygen source 46.<br>
Alternatively, ambient air may be supplied to the cathode side as an oxidant<br>
and hydrogen may be supplied to the anode from a methanol or gasoline<br>
reformer. At the anode side, the hydrogen is catalytically split into protons<br>
and electrons. The protons formed permeate through the PEM 78 to the<br>
cathode side. The electrons travel along an external load circuit (not shown)<br>
to the cathode side of the MEA 56, thus creating a current output of the fuel<br>
cell stack 10. Meanwhile, a stream of oxygen is delivered to the cathode<br>
side of the MEA 56. At the cathode side, oxygen molecules react with the<br>
protons permeating through the PEM 78, and the electrons arriving through<br>
the external circuit to form water molecules (not shown). To avoid flooding<br>
the electrodes of the fuel cell assembly 50 and to maintain a degree of<br>
hydration of the PEM 78, excess product water and water vapor is caused to<br>
flow to the diffusion media 55 by the gas flow through the fuel cell assembly<br>
50. The diffusion media 55 facilitate the removal of the excess product water<br>
from the fuel cell stack 10 during wet operating conditions by absorbing the<br>
water and wicking it away from the bipolar plates 52, 54. By wicking the<br>
water away from the bipolar plates 52, 54 and toward the PEM 78, the PEM<br>
78 maintain a degree of hydration to facilitate adequate conductivity in the<br>
fuel cell stack during dry operating conditions. The water in the diffusion<br>
media 55 is removed from the fuel cell stack 10 through manifolds (not<br>
shown) by the flow of hydrogen and oxygen gas adjacent to and through the<br>
diffusion media 55.<br><br>
[0030] Because the adhesive layers 58 are electrically conductive, the<br>
contact resistance between the diffusion media 55 and the bipolar plates 52,<br>
54 is minimized. Furthermore, because the adhesive layers 58 provide<br>
electrically conductive contact points between the diffusion media 55 and<br>
the bipolar plates 52, 54, the amount of compressive force placed on the<br>
fuel cell stack 10 to obtain adequate conductivity may be minimized. By<br>
minimizing the compressive force, elastic and plastic deformation of the<br>
bipolar plates 52, 54 and diffusion media 55 may be minimized, thereby<br>
increasing a useful life of the bipolar plates 52, 54. Minimizing the<br>
compressive force on the fuel cell stack 10 also militates against the<br>
intrusion of the diffusion media 55 into the flow channels 64 of the bipolar<br>
plates 52, 54 and fiber creep into the MEA 56.<br>
[0031] Referring next to Fig. 3, a fuel cell assembly 50' is shown according<br>
to another embodiment of the invention. The structure repeated from Fig. 2<br>
includes the same reference numerals and a prime symbol ('). The fuel cell<br>
assembly 50' includes a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 56' disposed<br>
between a plurality of diffusion media 55', one of the diffusion media 55'<br>
disposed between the MEA 56' and a first bipolar plate 52' and another of<br>
the diffusion media 55' disposed between the MEA 56' and a second<br>
bipolar plate 54'.<br>
[0032] The MEA 56' is disposed between the diffusion media 55' and<br>
includes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 78' disposed between two<br>
catalyst layers 80'. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the PEM 78' is a<br>
thin, solid polymer membrane-electrolyte but may be any conventional PEM,<br>
as desired. The catalyst layers 80' are typically formed from platinum, but<br>
may be any convention catalyst such as a platinum-ruthenium catalyst, for<br>
example.<br>
[0033] One of the diffusion media 55' is disposed between a side of the<br>
MEA 56' and the first bipolar plate 52' and another of the diffusion media<br>
55' is disposed between another side of the MEA 56' and the second<br>
bipolar plate 54'. The MEA 56' includes a first side 72' and a second side<br>
74'. A microporous layer 76' is disposed on the second side 74' of the<br>
diffusion media 55' between the diffusion media 55' and the MEA 56'. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the diffusion media 55' are carbon fiber paper such as<br><br>
the MRC U-105 paper produced by Mitsubishi Rayon Company. It is<br>
understood that the porous diffusion media 55' may also be a carbon cloth<br>
or other conventional material adapted to be electrically and thermally<br>
conductive. Furthermore, the diffusion media 55' may be untreated or<br>
treated on the second side 74', with a fluorocarbon polymer, as desired. The<br>
microporous layers 76' are formed from a carbon powder and fluorocarbon<br>
polymer mixture, and may be formed from any conventional carbon ink or<br>
carbon paste.<br>
[0034] The first bipolar plate 52' and the second bipolar plate 54' are formed<br>
from a first unipolar plate 60' and a second unipolar plate 62'. Each of the<br>
first bipolar plate 52' and the second bipolar plate 54' include a first working<br>
face 26' and a second working face 28'. The working faces 26', 28' include<br>
a plurality of flow channels 64' formed therein adapted to distribute a fuel<br>
and an oxidant gas across the bipolar plates 52', 54'. The plurality of flow<br>
channels 64' defines a plurality of lands 66' disposed therebetween.<br>
[0035] Further, the unipolar plates 60', 62' cooperate to form a flow path 68'<br>
intermediate the lands 66' of the unipolar plates 60, 62'. The flow path 68' is<br>
adapted to facilitate a distribution of a dielectric cooling fluid through the<br>
bipolar plates 52', 54'. Any number of flow paths 68' may be formed by the<br>
unipolar plates 60', 62', as desired. Also, the unipolar plates 60', 62' each<br>
form a perimeter portion 84 on an inner surface of an outer peripheral edge<br>
of the unipolar plates 60', 62'. The perimeter portions 84 cooperate to form<br>
a void adapted to receive a sealant 82. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
unipolar plates 60', 62' of the bipolar plates 52', 54' are coupled together<br>
with solder 70'. However, the unipolar plates 60', 62' may be coupled by<br>
any conventional means such as with a b-stage adhesive or by weld-<br>
adhering, for example, or the bipolar plates 52', 54' may be formed from a<br>
single piece of material, as desired. In the embodiment shown, the bipolar<br>
plates 52', 54' are formed from 316 stainless steel but may be formed from<br>
any conventional material such as graphite or a polymer, for example, as<br>
desired. It is understood that the flow channels 64' may be linear,<br>
substantially undulated, serpentine, or may have any other configuration, as<br>
desired.<br><br>
[0036] An adhesive layer 58' is disposed on the flow channels 64' and lands<br>
66' of each of the bipolar plates 52', 54'. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
adhesive layers 58' are adjacent the second sides 74' of the diffusion media<br>
55' and is formed by an electrically conductive b-stage adhesive. The<br>
adhesive layers 58' couple the lands 66' of the bipolar plates 52', 54' to the<br>
first sides 72' of the diffusion media 55'. The adhesive layers 58' may be<br>
formed from any electrically conductive material, as desired. The adhesive<br>
layers 58' may also be a conductive thermoplastic adhesive, a conductive<br>
thermoplastic adhesive, or a combined conductive primer and conductive<br>
adhesive.<br>
[0037] The sealant 82 is disposed between the voids formed by the<br>
perimeter portions 84 of each of the bipolar plates 52', 54', the MEA 56',<br>
and an outer portion 85 of a fuel cell stack (not shown) to bond the<br>
aforementioned components together and form a seal between the<br>
components. In the embodiment shown, the sealants 82 are a hot melt<br>
sealant such as an epoxy resin. The perimeter portions 84 may be formed in<br>
the outer peripheral edge of the bipolar plates 52', 54' or the perimeter<br>
portions 84 may be formed intermediate the outer peripheral edge and the<br>
working faces 26', 28' of the bipolar plates 52', 54'. The outer portion 85<br>
may be a gasket, a compression means, or other fuel cell stack component,<br>
as desired. It is understood that the sealant 82 may be any conventional<br>
material adapted to form a seal between the bipolar plates 52', 54'and the<br>
MEA 56'. It is understood that the sealant 82 may be separately formed<br>
using an injection molding procedure and disposed in the perimeter portions<br>
84. The sealant 82 may also be applied directly to the perimeter portions 84<br>
of the bipolar plate 52' using a conventional process such as hand coating<br>
or spray coating the sealant 82 on the perimeter portions 84. Also, the<br>
sealant 82 may be applied to the unipolar plates 60', 62' during a coil<br>
coating process, or the sealant 82 may be a gasket separately formed and<br>
disposed in the perimeter portions 84, as desired.<br>
[0038] To assemble the fuel cell assembly 50' shown in Fig. 3, the first<br>
unipolar plate 60' is adhered to the second unipolar plate 62' to form the<br>
bipolar plates 52', 54'. The first unipolar plate 60' may be adhered to the<br>
second unipolar plate 62' by any conventional adhering means such as spot<br><br>
welding, laser welding, adhesive adhering, or soldering, for example, as<br>
desired. The first unipolar plate 60' is adhered to the second unipolar plate<br>
62' to minimize interfacial electrical resistance through the bipolar plates<br>
52', 54'. It is understood that the bipolar plates 52', 54' may be formed from<br>
a single, integrally formed plate, as desired. The working faces 26', 28' of<br>
the bipolar plates 52', 54' are treated with a primer to facilitate improved<br>
adhering of the adhesive layer 58' and unipolar plates 60', 62'. The primer<br>
may be an acid primer, an alkaline primer, or a self-etching adhesive layer,<br>
as desired. The adhesive layer 58' is disposed on the flow channels 64' and<br>
the lands 66' of the working faces 26', 28' of the bipolar plates 52', 54'. The<br>
adhesive layer 58' may be disposed on the bipolar plates 52', 54' by any<br>
conventional method such as pressed on or sprayed on, for example, as<br>
desired. Also, if the unipolar plates 60', 62' are formed from a metal, the<br>
adhesive layer 58' may be applied to the metal during a coil coating process<br>
and prior to a stamping process that forms the unipolar plates 60', 62'. It is<br>
understood that if the bipolar plates 52', 54' are formed from a polymeric<br>
material, the adhesive layer 58' may be applied directly to the bipolar plates<br>
52', 54' without applying a primer, or the polymeric bipolar plates 52', 54'<br>
may receive a corona discharge treatment or radio frequency glow<br>
discharge treatment to facilitate improved adhering of the adhesive layer 58'<br>
to the bipolar plates 52', 54'.<br>
[0039] The diffusion media 55', the microporous layer 76', the PEM 78', and<br>
the catalyst layer 80' are assembled together. A paste (not shown) is formed<br>
containing a mixture of a carbon powder and fluorocarbon polymers, applied<br>
to the second side 74' of the diffusion media 55', and sintered at or near<br>
380°C to cause the diffusion media 55' and the microporous layer to adhere<br>
together. The microporous layer 76' is adhered to a first face of the catalyst<br>
layer 80' with a self-blocking mechanism by heating the diffusion media 55',<br>
the microporous layer 76', and the catalyst layer 80' at or near 130°C. The<br>
second face of the catalyst layer 80' is adhered to a first side of the PEM<br>
78'. A second diffusion media 55', microporous layer 76', and catalyst layer<br>
80' assembly prepared as described above is adhered to a second side of<br>
the PEM 78'.<br><br>
[0040] The sealant 82 is disposed in the perimeter portions 84 of the first<br>
bipolar plate 52'. One of the diffusion media 55' is pressed against the<br>
adhesive layer 58' of the bipolar plate 52', and the other diffusion media 55'<br>
is pressed against the adhesive layer 58' of a second bipolar plate 54'.<br>
Once assembled, the fuel cell assembly 50' may be heated to cause the<br>
sealant 82 to bond to the bipolar plates 52', 54' and a perimeter of the MEA<br>
56' and to facilitate an improved adhesion of the MEA 56' and the bipolar<br>
plates 52', 54'. The sealant 82' may also form a fluid-tight seal between the<br>
MEA 56' and the bipolar plates 52', 54', as desired.<br>
[0041] Because the adhesive layers 58' are electrically conductive, the<br>
contact resistance between the diffusion media 55' and the bipolar plates<br>
52', 54' is minimized. Furthermore, because the adhesive layers 58' provide<br>
electrically conductive contact points between the diffusion media 55' and<br>
the bipolar plates 52', 54', the amount of compressive force placed on the<br>
fuel cell stack to obtain adequate conductivity is minimized. By minimizing<br>
the compressive force, elastic and plastic deformation of the bipolar plates<br>
52', 54' and diffusion media 55' is minimized, thereby increasing a useful<br>
life of the bipolar plates 52', 54'. Minimizing the compressive force on the<br>
fuel cell stack also militates against the intrusion of the diffusion media 55'<br>
into the flow channels 64' of the bipolar plates 52', 54' and fiber creep into<br>
the MEA 56'.<br>
