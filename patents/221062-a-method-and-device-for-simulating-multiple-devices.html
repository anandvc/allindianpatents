SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DYNAMICALLY SIMULATING<br>
DEVICES AT A COMPUTING DEVICE-<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60/520,047,<br>
filed November 13, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to device simulators. More particularly, the invention relates to computer applications for simulating devices.<br>
II.	Description of Related Art<br>
[0003] Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful personal computing devices. For example, there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices, including wireless computing devices, such as portable wireless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and paging devices that are smalL lightweight, and easily carried by users. More specifically, portable wireless telephones, for example, further include cellular telephones mat communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further, many such wireless telephones provide significant computing capabilities, and as such, are becoming tantamount to small personal computers and hand-held PDAs.<br>
[0004] Typically, these smaller and more powerful personal computing devices are often resource constrained. For example, the screen size, the amount of available memory and file system space, and the amount of input and output capabilities may be limited by the small size of the device. Because of such severe resource constraints, it is can be desirable to maintain a limited size and quantity of software applications and other information residing on such personal computing devices (client computing devices).<br>
[0005] Some of these personal computing devices utilize application programming interfaces (APIs) that are sometimes referred to as runtime environments and software platforms. The APIs can be installed onto a local computer platform and can be used to simplify the operation and programming of such devices by providing generalized calls<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2004/038344<br>
for device specific resources. Further, some APIs can provide software developers the ability to create software applications that are fully executable on such devices. In addition, APIs can provide an interface between a personal computing device system hardware and the software applications. As such, the personal computing device functionality can be made available to the software applications without requiring the software developer to access the source code of the specific personal computing device. Further, some APIs can provide mechanisms for secure communications between personal devices, such as client devices and server systems, using secure cryptographic key information.<br>
[0006] Examples of such APIs, some of which are discussed in more detail below, include those currently publicly available versions of the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®), developed by Qualcomm, Inc. of San Diego, California. BREW® can be described as a thin veneer that exists over the operating system of a computing device, such as a wireless cellular phone. BREW® can provide one or more interfaces to hardware features particularly found on personal computing devices. [0007] Further, BREW® is advantageous in that it can be provided on personal computing devices at a relatively low cost with respect to the demands on device resources and with respect to the prices typically paid by consumers for devices containing the BREW® APL Additionally, BREW® provides an end-to-end software distribution platform that includes a variety of benefits for wireless service operators, software developers and computing device consumers. One such currently available end-to-end software distribution platform includes logic distributed over a server-client architecture, wherein the server can perform billing, security, and application distribution functionality, and wherein the client can perform application execution, security and user interface functionality.<br>
[0008] In order to develop software for various types of portable personal computing devices, it is sometimes necessary to physically possess and test the particular physical device for which the software is being developed. The possession of the physical device can allow a developer to execute the software loaded onto the physical device in order to debug the software and determine if the developed software provides the functionality intended by the developer. Alternatively, the software developer can use a device simulator, but such device simulators are typically static and tied to a single type and model of a physical device.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2004/038344<br><br>
[0009] Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide an improved device simulator that can simulate multiple devices exhibiting multiple behaviors.<br>

application programs can be tested using simulated devices generated at the computer device.<br>
[0035] In one or more embodiments, a device simulator can simulate one or more personal computing devices and can operate in conjunction with a runtime environment. One such runtime environment is a version of the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless® (BREW®) software platform developed by QUALCOMM, Inc., of San Diego, California. In at least one embodiment in the following description, the system used to provide communications between client computing devices and servers is implemented on a computing device executing a runtime environment, such as the current version of the BREW® software platform. However, one or more embodiments of the system used to provide communications between client computing devices and servers are suitable for use with other types of runtime environments that, for example, operate to control the execution of applications on wireless client computing devices. [0936] FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a system 100 for the loading, reloading, and deletion of software application components on a wireless device, such as cellular telephone 102. The cellular telephone 102 communicates across a wireless network 104 with at least one application server 106. Further, the application server 106 can selectively transmit one or more software applications and components to one or more wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network 104. [0037] As illustrated in FIG. 1, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone 102, a personal digital assistant 108, a pager 110, or a separate computer platform 112 that has a wireless communication portal. In a particular embodiment, the pager 110 can be a two-way text pager. Further, in an alternative embodiment, the wireless device can have a wired connection 114 to a network or the Internet. The exemplary, non-limiting system can include any form of a remote module including a wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, personal computers, access terminals, telephones without a display or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof.<br>
[0038] As depicted in FIG. 1, the application download server 106 is coupled to a network 116 with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network 104. The system 100 includes is a second server 120 and a stand-alone server 122, and each server can provide separate services and processes to the wireless devices 102,<br><br>
WO 2005/030387	PCT/US2001/038344<br>
108, 110, 112 across the wireless network 104. Further, as indicated in FIG. 1, the system 100 also includes at least one stored application database 118 that stores software applications that are downloadable by the wireless devices 102, 108, 110,112. Different embodiments are contemplated that locate logic to perform secure communications at any one or more of the application download server 106, the second server 120 and the stand-alone server 122.<br>
[0039] In FIG. 2, a block diagram is shown that more fully illustrates the system 100, including the components of the wireless network 104 and interrelation of the elements of the system 100. The system 100 is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules, such as the wireless chent computing devices 102, 108, 110, 112 communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components connected via a wireless network 104, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers. The application download server 106 and me stored application database 118, along with any other servers, such as server 120, mat can provide cellular telecommunication services and can communicate with a carrier network 200 through a data link, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. In an illustrative embodiment, the server 120 contains a server security module 121 mat further contains logic configured to provide for secure communications over the carrier network 200. In a particular embodiment, the server security module 121 can operate in conjunction with a client security module located on a client computing device, such as wireless devices 102, 108, 110, 112, to provide secure communications.<br>
[0040] The carrier network 200 controls messages (sent as data packets) sent to a mobile switching center ("MSC") 202. The carrier network 200 communicates with the MSC 202 by a network, such as the Internet and/or POTS ("plain ordinary telephone system"). Typically, the network connection between the carrier network 200 and the MSC 202 transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC 202 is connected to multiple base transceiver stations ("BTS") 204. The MSC 202 can be connected to the BTS 204 by both the network and/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS 204 ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as to cellular telephone 102, by the short messaging service ('SMS"), or other over-the-air methods known in the art<br>

WO 200S/050387	PCT/US2004/038344<br><br>
[0041] The wireless device, e.g., a wireless client computing device, such as cellular telephone 102, has a computer platform 206 that can receive and execute software applications transmitted from the application download server 106. The computer platform 206 may he implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC" 208), a processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC 208 is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device. The ASIC 208 or other processor can execute an application programming interface ("API") 210 layer that interfaces with resident programs in the memory 212 of the wireless device. The memory 212 can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM or ROM), EEPROM, flash memory, or any other memory suitable to computer platforms. The API 210 also includes a client security module 214 containing logic configured to provide for secure communications over the carrier network 200. In a particular embodiment, the client security module 214 can operate in conjunction with the server security module 121 to provide secure communications. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the computer platform 206 can further include a local database 216 that can hold applications not actively used in memory 212. In an illustrative embodiment, the local database 216 is a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or floppy or hard disk.<br>
[0042] A wireless client computing device, for example, the cellular telephone 102, can download one or more software applications, such as games, news, stock monitors, and the like, from the application download server 106. Further, the wireless computing device can store the application in the local database 216, when not in use, and can upload stored resident applications from the local database 216 to memory 212 for execution by the API 210 when desired by the user. Further, communications over the wireless network 104 are performed in a secure manner, at least in part, by the interaction and operation between the chent security module 214 and the server security module 121.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 3, a system for simulating personal computing devices is shown and is generally designated 300. As shown, the system 300 includes a computing system 302. In an illustrative embodiment, the computing system 302 can be a desktop computing device, a laptop computing device, or a handheld computing device. An input device 304 is coupled to the computing system 302. In an illustrative<br>
11<br><br><br>
WO-2005/050387	PCT/US2005/038344<br>
embodiment, the input device 304 can be used to input data or information. In a particular embodiment, the input device 304 is a keyboard. In other exemplary, non-limiting embodiments, the input device 304 can be a mouse, a light pen, a scanner, a touch screen, a cellular telephone, a digital camera, or an MP3 player.                                  [0044] FIG. 3 further illustrates an output device 306 coupled to the computing system 302. The output device 306 can receive one or more outputs from the computing system 302 via a wire connection, a cable connection, or a wireless connection. In an illustrative embodiment, the output device 306 is a display device. In other exemplary, non-limiting embodiments, the output device 306 can be a printer, a recording device, a plotter, or a projector. FIG. 3 also shows a network connection device 308 that is also coupled to the computing system 302. The network connection device 308 can provide connectivity to a network, for example, a local area network (LAN). a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, or the Internet. In an illustrative embodiment, the network connection device 308 can be a modem or a router.<br>
[0045] As shown in FIG. 3, the computing system 302 includes a processor 310 and a memory 312. The memory device 312 is coupled to the processor 310 and is accessible to the processor 310. In an illustrative embodiment, the memory device 312 can be a non-volatile memory device 312, such as a hard disk drive. The memory device 312 can be a read-only memory (ROM) device or random access memory (RAM) device. As further illustrated in FIG. 3, a device simulator 314 is loaded and is embedded within the memory device 312. In a particular embodiment, the device simulator 314 can simulate one or more personal computing devices at the computing system 302. [0046] In a particular embodiment, an application program can be executed on the device simulator 314 within the computing system to simulate operation of a physical personal computing device. The application can be input to the computing system 302 and executed so that it appears to be executed on a simulated device that corresponds to the a selected physical personal computing device for which the computer application is intended. As such, a software developer can test a particular application program without having to port the application program to the particular physical personal computing device for which the program is intended. In an illustrative embodiment, the device simulator 314 can simulate different makes and models of cellular telephones. Also, the device simulator 314 can simulate different makes and models of portable digital assistants (PDAs), different makes and models of pagers, and different makes<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2004/038344<br>
and models of other devices for which a computer application can be written. Further, the device simulator 314 can assign a core set of behaviors and an optional variety of additional behaviors to the simulated devices. For example, the device simulator 314 can use extension files to assign an audio player behavior, a video player behavior, an image viewer behavior, a digital video camera behavior, a digital still camera behavior, and a digital audio recorder behavior.<br>
[0047] After applications are tested at the device simulator, the tested applications can be uploaded to a repository, e.g., the stored application database 118 show in FIG. 1. Further, the tested applications, which may have been modified based on the testing, can be downloaded to one or more wireless devices 102, 108, 110, 112 (FIG. 1). A service provider can charge a fee for each downloaded application and pass a portion of that fee to the software developer.<br>
[0048] Referring to FIG. 4, an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a device simulator is shown and is generally designated 400. In an illustrative embodiment, the device simulator 400 can operate with the binary run-time environment for wireless (BREW) platform. However, the device simulator can operate on any other platform or operating system. As shown, the device simulator includes a BREW core 402. Further, the device simulator 400 includes an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) layer 404. The BREW core 402 includes multiple core BREW libraries and modules mat can be used as an API to OEM layer 404. In a particular embodiment, the OEM layer 404 includes device specific code that can port BREW onto a computer in which the device simulator 400 is installed and executed.<br>
[0049] FIG. 4 also shows that the device simulator 400 further includes a shared extensions module 406 that is coupled to the BREW core 402. As shown, the shared extensions module 406 includes extensions that can be made available to applications during operation of the device simulator 400. In a particular embodiment, the shared extensions module 406 includes a first generic extension 408 and a second generic extension 410. Further, the shared extensions module 406 includes a first built-in extension 412 and a second built-in extension 414.<br>
[0050] In a particular embodiment, the generic extensions 408, 410 and the built-in extensions 412, 414 include features that are typically common to the devices that can be simulated by the device simulator. These features, for example, can include generic<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2004/0383444 -<br>
button sizes and shapes, generic display sizes and shapes, generic speaker sizes shapes, generic microphone sizes and shapes, generic antenna sizes and shapes. [0051J As illustrated in FIG. 4, the device simulator 400 includes a first device pack 416 and a second device pack 418. Each, device pack 416, 418 represents a particular physical device that can be simulated by the device simulator 400. Further, each device pack 416, 418 includes device model information relevant to the device that is represented by the device pack 416, 418. For example, each device pack 416, 418 can include networking and socket information for a particular device. Also, each device pack 416, 418 can include memory information such as the type of memory included in the device and the size of the memory. Further, the device packs 416, 418 can include display information including the type of display, e.g., liquid crystal display (LCD), the size of the display, and the resolution of the display.<br>
[0052] Additionally, the device packs 416, 418 can include primary keypad information, secondary keypad information, keyboard information, primary display information, secondary display information, audio information, font information, supported media formats, application support, Bluetooth information, joystick information, touch screen information, global positioning system information, network information, predictive text entry information, memory information, subscriber information module information, and other device specific information, such as ring tones, call history information, address book information, and screen saver information. Appendix I shows an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a program written to create a device pack, hi particular, the program shown in Appendix I can cause the device simulator 400 to display a simulation of a cellular telephone. FIG. 4 shows that the first device pack 416 includes a first extension 420, a second extension 422, and a third extension 424. FIG. 4 also shows that the second device pack 418 includes a first extension 426 and a second extension 428.<br>
[0053] In a particular embodiment, the extensions included in each device pack 416, 418 are specific to the simulated device associated with the device pack 416,418. Also, the extensions represent certain features or characteristics of a physical device that correspond to a simulated device. For example, these features can include, but are not limited to, audio player features, e.g., MP3 file playing, video player features, image viewer features, video camera features, still camera features, and audio recorder features. In a particular embodiment, if the device pack 416,418 includes any behavior<br>
14<br><br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2001/0383H<br>
-14-<br>
extensions that conflict with the generic extensions, the device pack extensions will override the generic extension behavior. When either device pack 416,418 is loaded by a computer to the device simulator after being selected by a user, the extensions are available to any dynamic applications that are loaded to the device simulator for execution at the simulated device.<br>
[0054] Additionally, FIG. 4 shows a plurality of dynamic BREW applications. Specifically, FIG. 4 shows a first dynamic BREW application 430, a second dynamic BREW application 432, a third dynamic BREW application 434, and a fourth dynamic BREW application 436. The dynamic applications 430, 432, 434, 436 can include programs that are being developed for use on a physical portable computing device. For example, the dynamic applications can include games, business applications, ring tones, and other business or entertainment related applications. In a particular embodiment, the dynamic BREW applications 430, 432, 434, 436 can have direct access to the BREW core 402, any shared applications, and any device pack extensions mat are loaded to the device simulator. In a particular embodiment, during operation, the dynamic BREW applications 430, 432, 434, 436 can be executed by the device simulator on a simulated device or environment This can allow developers of the dynamic BREW applications 430,432,434,436 to execute the BREW applications 430, 432, 434, 436 on a BREW platform during development, in order to test and debug the BREW applications 430, 432, 434, 436 and to determine whether the operation of the dynamic BREW applications 430, 432,434,436 is as intended by the developer.                  [0055] In a particular embodiment, the device simulator includes a common location for loading all extensions and the loaded extensions are applicable across all device packs for a particular instance of the device simulator. Further, when a device pack is loaded in the device simulator, the extensions may be loaded as follows: First, the built-in extensions are loaded. The built-in extensions are implicit to the device simulator and cannot be changed by the user. Second, generic extensions that are available and applicable to the device packs axe loaded. The generic extensions are explicit to the device simulator can be modified or provided by a user and uploaded to the device simulator. The generic extensions can override the previously loaded built-in extensions only if they implement the functionality for the same BREW interface or BREW class as the previously loaded extensions. Third, the device pack extensions that are specific to the device pack are loaded. The device pack extensions are also explicit<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	P€T/US2004/038344<br>
15<br>
to the device simulator and can be modified or provided by a user and uploaded to the device simulator. The device pack extensions can override the generic extension loaded second if they implement the functionality for the same BREW interface or BREW class as the generic extensions loaded second. The device pack extensions can also override the built-in extensions, loaded first, if they implement the functionality for the same BREW interface or BREW class as the extensions loaded first.                                 [0056] Accordingly, if a built-in extension for a display is loaded first and then, a generic extension for the display is loaded, the generic extension will override the built-in extension. Thereafter, if a device pack extension for a display is loaded, it will override the generic extension and the built-in extension. If the generic extension is for a keypad, it will not override the built-in extension for a display, but a device pack extension for a display will still override a built-in extension for a display. In the explanation above, a BREW interface is intended to mean a collection of functions offering a similar service and is uniquely identified by a 32-bit identifier. Further, a BREW class is intended to mean an implementation of functions in a BREW interface. [0057] In a particular example, with reference to FIG. 4, the assumption is made that the first device pack extension 420 is an updated or modified implementation of the second generic extension 410 and the second generic extension 410, in turn, is an updated or modified implementation of the first built in extension. As such, when the first device pack 416 is loaded onto the device simulator 400, the functionality provided by the first device pack extension 420, the second, device pack extension 422, the third device pack extension 424, the first generic extension 408, and the second built-in extension 414 are available to the BREW applications 430, 432, 434, 436. This is due to the fact that the first device pack extension 420 overrides the second generic extension 410, which, in turn, overrides the first built-in extension 412.                                 [0058] Referring to FIG. 5, a method of simulating devices is shown and commences at block 500. At block 500, a computer executes a device simulator, e.g., the device simulator described herein. At block 502, the device simulator detects a selection of a particular physical device to be simulated. In a particular embodiment, a user can use a drop down menu to select from a list of physical devices that can be simulated or the user can use a drop down menu to select a particular device pack associated with a particular physical device.  Moving to block 504, the computing device loads a device<br>
	16<br><br>
WO 2005/030387	PCT/US2001/038344<br>
pack associated with the selected device.   Then, at block 506, the device simulator<br>
executes the device pack to create a simulated device at the device simulator.<br>
(0059] Proceeding to block 510, the device simulator loads one or more device behavior<br>
extensions associated with the device pack.  The extensions can be loaded as described<br>
herein.  Thereafter, at block 510, the device simulator can apply the device behavior<br>
extension to the simulated device presented by the device simulator.    The device<br>
behavior extensions can define or modify the appearance of the simulated device.<br>
Further, the device behavior extensions can define or modify the functionality or the<br>
behavior of the simulated device. Then, the method proceeds to decision step 512.<br>
[0060] Continuing the description of the method, at decision step 512, the device<br>
simulator detects whether a data set is selected via the device simulator. If a data set is<br>
selected, the method continues to block 514 and the device simulator loads the data set<br>
In a particular embodiment, the data set can be a joint photographic experts group<br>
(JPEG) file, a graphics interchange format (GIF) file, a tagged image file format (TIFF)<br>
file, a Adobe Photoshop (PSD) file, a portable networks graphics (PNG) file, a windows<br>
metafile (WMF) file, or other type of picture file that can be viewed at the simulated<br>
device. Also, the data set can be a moving picture experts group (MPEG) file, an audio<br>
video interleave (AVI) file, a Windows media video (WMV) file, air advanced<br>
streaming format (ASF) file, a QuickTime (MOV) file, a Real Media (RM) file, or other<br>
type of video file that can be viewed at the simulated device.  The data set can be an<br>
MPEG audio layer three (MP3) file, a waveform audio format (WAV) file, a wma file,<br>
an OGG file, a Monkey's Audio digital file (APE) file, a VOX file, a Real Audio (RA)<br>
file, a synthetic music mobile application format (MMF) file, or musical instrument<br>
digital interface (MID) file, a phrase format (SPF) file, a Qualcomm PureVoice audio<br>
file (QCP) or other sound file that can be listened to via the simulated device. The audio<br>
files can also be used as ring tones for cellular telephone devices. Further, the data set<br>
can be a font file that includes one or more fonts available on the computer or one or<br>
more fonts that are specific to simulated devices. Moving to block 514, the data set is<br>
applied to the simulated device. From block 516, the method moves to decision step<br>
518.    Returning to decision step 512, if a data set is not selected via the device<br>
simulator, the method proceeds to decision step 518.<br>
[0061] At decision step 518, the device simulator detects whether an application written for a simulated device has been selected via the device simulator. If so, the application<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2005/030387		PCT/US2001/038311—<br><br>
is loaded onto the device simulator at block 520. At block 522, the application is executed at the device simulator, e.g., at the simulated device. Particularly, the application can be executed at a simulated device environment that is provided by the device simulator and that corresponds to the operating environment of a particular physical device. Moving to decision step 524, the computer or the user determines whether the application has any problems or "bugs." If not the method then moves to decision step 600 of FIG. 6. If there are bugs, the logic moves to block 526 and the application is modified, i.e., debugged. Next, at block 528, the debugged application is loaded to the device simulator. The logic then returns to block 522 and continues as described herein. Returning to decision step 518, if an application is not selected via the device simulator the method also moves to decision step 600 of FIG. 6. [0062] Referring to FIG. 6, at block 600, the device simulator detects whether a new device is selected to be simulated at the device simulator. If a new device is selected, the device simulator executes a device pack associated with the newly selected device in order to create a new simulated device, at block 602. At block 604, a device behavior extension associated with the newly selected device is loaded at the device simulator. Thereafter, at block 606, the device simulator applies the new device behavior extension to the simulated device. The method then moves to decision step 608. <br>
[0063] At decision step 608, the device simulator detects whether a new data set has been selected via the device simulator. If a new data set has been selected, the new data set is loaded to the device simulator, at block 610. Particularly, the new data set is loaded to the new simulated device at the device simulator and can be applied to, or processed by, the new simulated device, at block 612. Thereafter, the method proceeds to decision step 614. Returning to decision step 608, if a new data set is not selected, the logic moves to decision step 616 and the device simulator determines whether to apply the previously selected data to the new simulated device. In a particular embodiment, this determination can be made by presenting a question to a user. If the device simulator determines to apply the previously selected data to the new simulated device, the method proceeds to block 618 and the device simulator applies the previously selected data to the simulated device. The logic then proceeds to decision step 614.<br>
[0064] At decision step 614, the device simulator determines whether a new application developed for the new simulated device is selected. If so, the new application is loaded<br>
18<br><br><wo pct></wo>
onto the device simulator, at block 620. Particularly, the new application is loaded onto the simulated device at the device simulator. Next, at block 622, the new application is executed at the device simulator as described herein. Thereafter, the logic proceeds to decision step 624.<br>
[0065] Returning to decision step 614, if a new application is not selected, the method continues to decision step 626 and the device simulator determines whether to execute the previously selected application at the simulated device. If so, the device simulator executes the previously selected and previously loaded device application at the simulated device. On the other hand, if the previously selected application is not to be executed, the logic continues to decision step 624 and the device simulator detects whether a user has decided to close the device simulator. If the user has decided to close the device simulator, the device simulator closes at "block 630 and the method ends at step 632. If the device simulator is not closed at decision step 624, the logic returns to decision step 600 and continues as described above. In an illustrative embodiment, the method steps described herein are performed in the sequence shown. However, in one or more alternative embodiments, one or more of the method steps may be performed in a different sequence.<br>
(0066] FIG. 7 shows a graphical user interface, generally designated 700, that can be presented by the device simulator, described above. As shown the GUI 700 can include a first instance of a device simulator 702 and a second instance of a device simulator 704. The first instance of the device simulator 702 includes a first simulated device 706. Also, as shown in FIG. 7, the second instance of the device simulator 704 includes a second simulated device 708. In a particular embodiment, the first simulated device 706 is a simulation of a first model of a particular cellular telephone having particular functionality. Also, the second simulated device 708 is a simulation of a second model of a particular cellular telephone having different functionality. Further, in a particular embodiment, the base device simulator is the same in each instance of the device simulator 702, 704. In other words, the same background can be provided, the same drop down menus can be provided, and the same options can be provided. [0067] A user can select a particular physical device via a drop down menu. The device simulator will generate a simulation of the physical device and present the simulation to the user as shown. The simulated devices 706, 708 will appear, behave, and function according to one or more behavior extensions loaded onto the device simulator 702,<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2005/050387	PCT/US2004/038344-<br><br>
704. Accordingly, if a camera behavior extension is loaded onto either of the simulated devices 706, 708 may operate as a camera phone. Further, if an audio player extension is loaded onto either of the simulated devices 706, 708 may operate as an MP3 player. [0068] A user can select files, e.g., audio files, to load onto the simulated devices 706, 708. This can allow a user to test the operation of the simulated devices 706, 708. Further, a user can select one or more applications to be executed at the simulated devices 706, 708. Thus, a user can determine if one or more applications can be supported by particular physical devices. Further, a user can determine if one or more applications can function as intended by the user. In a particular embodiment, a particular application, or file, may utilize a first set of behavior extensions at the first simulated device 706 and a second set of behavior extensions at the second simulated device 708. As such, a particular program may exhibit a first behavior at a first simulated device 706 and a second behavior at a second simulated device 708. <br>
[0069] in the example shown in FIG. 7, MID, MMF, and SPF files are enabled for the first simulated device 706. However, QCP and MP3 file formats are not included in the device pack for the first simulated device 706. As such, a Media Player list for the first simulated device 706 only lists .mid, mmf, and .spf files. On the other hand, the device pack associated with the second simulated device 708 does not contain the MID multimedia extension.<br>
[0670] With the configuration of structure described above, the device simulator provides a very flexible tool that can be used during the development of applications for various portable computing devices. The device simulator allows device packs to dynamically provide functionality for the simulated devices provided by the device packs. Further, the functionality of the device simulator can be extended as new devices are developed by developing new device packs for the new devices. Also, the device simulator is modular and enables a simulation environment that provides operations that are very close to those of physical devices.<br>

functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.
