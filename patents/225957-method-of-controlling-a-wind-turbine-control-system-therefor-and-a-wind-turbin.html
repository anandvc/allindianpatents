				<td>METHOD OF CONTROLLING A WIND TURBINE, CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
THEREFOR AND A WIND TURBINE<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a wind turbine connected to an<br>
electric utility grid during malfunction in said electric utility grid, a control system<br>
therefor, and a wind turbine.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, wind turbines are connected to an electric utility grid in order to be able to<br>
generate and supply electric power to consumers located remotely from the wind<br>
turbines. The power is sent through the transmission or distribution lines of the utility<br>
grid to homes, businesses and so on.<br>
Wind turbines and other electric power generating means connected to a utility grid<br>
are protected from malfunctions in the utility grid by grid disconnection switches.<br>
Malfunction in the utility grid may e.g. be<br>
transients or "spikes" which are very short-duration over-voltage and over-<br>
current power surges. The most dramatic transients are caused by strokes of<br>
lightning, but a majority are caused by large power loads switching on and<br>
off.<br>
sags or "brownouts" which are among the most commonly recorded power<br>
disturbances, and may occur as a momentary voltage drop.<br><br>
• power interruptions, power outage, or "blackouts" which are the full loss of<br>
power in the utility grid.<br>
The switches disconnect the wind turbines from the utility grid at the detection of the<br>
malfunction. The malfunction may be defined as grid variations above some specific<br>
limit e.g. voltage drops above +/- 5 % in relation to the nominal value of the grid<br>
voltage.<br>
A problem with the grid disconnection of the wind turbines is the fact that the<br>
voltage variation may increase in size or duration by the loss of electric power<br>
production from the wind turbine generators. Further, the disconnected wind turbines<br>
require a period of time before they can be connected to the utility grid again. The<br>
disconnection of the wind turbines affects the production of power from the wind<br>
turbines and thus their profitability.<br>
One of the objects of the invention is to establish a method and control system for<br>
controlling a wind turbine during malfunction in an electric utility grid without the<br>
above-mentioned disadvantage. It is especially an object of the invention to create a<br>
method and system which improve the strength and stability of the utility grid during<br>
malfunctions as well as the profitability of the connected wind turbines.<br>
The invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a wind turbine connected to an<br>
electric utility grid during malfunction in said electric utility grid, said method<br>
comprising the steps of<br>
detecting a malfunction in said electric utility grid,<br><br>
monitoring at least one physical work property of at least one component of said<br>
wind turbine,<br>
comparing said at least one physical work property with at least one predefined limit,<br>
and<br>
controlling one or more wind turbine blades of said wind turbine in order to keep<br>
said at least one physical work property below at least one predefined limit in a time<br>
period of said malfunction.<br>
Hereby, a method for controlling a wind turbine during malfunction in an electric<br>
utility grid is established without the above-mentioned disadvantage. Especially, it is<br>
advantageous that the method allows the wind turbine to remain connected and<br>
supply power to the grid during the malfunction without damaging components in<br>
the wind turbine. The wind turbine will help stabilize the utility grid by remaining<br>
connected and generating power during the malfunction whereas an initial<br>
disconnection may increase or prolong the malfunction.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said detection for a grid malfunction is performed<br>
continuously or discontinuously e.g. every half second. Hereby, it is possible to<br>
ensure a high reliability in the detection as well as a high throughput and low<br>
response time from the start of the malfunction.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said monitoring of at least one physical work<br>
property includes monitoring of the temperature in the stator and/or rotor of the<br>
generator, the semiconductors of the electric control systems, the transformer and/or<br>
the gear means of the wind turbine. Hereby, it is possible to monitor the components<br>
of a wind turbine that normally is most likely to suffer high temperatures during a<br>
malfunction and thus face lifespan reductions if the property is not monitored and<br>
controlled.<br><br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the grid malfunction is detected as grid voltage,<br>
current, frequency and/or temperature variations above a first predefined limit.<br>
Hereby, advantageous embodiments of the invention are achieved, especially as the<br>
limits may be compensated to fit different applications and surroundings. Further, the<br>
detected values may be combined in order to establish a clear indication of a grid<br>
malfunction.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said wind turbine is disconnected from the<br>
utility grid at temperatures or grid voltage, current, frequency variations above a<br>
second predefined limit. Hereby, it is assured that the wind turbine components are<br>
not damaged by severe or long lasting malfunctions in the utility grid. Further, it is<br>
ensured that the wind turbine is not kept grid connected if the connection is<br>
meaningless e.g. at total black-outs.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, the pitch of said one or more wind turbine blades is<br>
controlled to keep said at least one physical work property below at least one<br>
predefined limit in a time period of said malfunction.<br>
hi an aspect of the invention, the pitch is controlled continuously during the<br>
malfunction or in one or more steps such as an instantaneous step at the start of the<br>
malfunction. Hereby, it may be assured that the power absorbed in the components<br>
and thus the internal temperature in the components may not go up to an unsound<br>
level e.g. harming the lifespan of the components.<br>
hi an aspect of the invention, the pitch of said one or more wind turbine blades is<br>
controlled in order to lower the generated power from the wind turbine generator<br>
during the malfunction e.g. from 100 to 30 % of the nominal power generation.<br>
Hereby, it is possible to construct a simple control method in which the pitch is<br>
lowered to a predefined value at the start of the malfunction. With the lowering it is<br>
ensured that the wind turbine may be kept grid connected for a longer period in<br>
which the malfunction may disappear again. If the malfunction continues or the<br><br>
temperature starts to rise significantly, the wind turbine may either be disconnected<br>
or the pitch lowered further resulting in an even lower power generation.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, the optimal pitch is resumed after the malfunction has<br>
been detected as terminated. Hereby, an advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
is achieved, especially as the power generation is assumed quickly and thus ensuring<br>
the profitability of the wind turbine.<br>
The invention also relates to a control system in which said system, further comprises<br>
means for comparison of said at least one physical work property and at least one<br>
predefined limit, and<br>
means for controlling one or more wind turbine blades of said wind turbine in a time<br>
period of said malfunction<br>
where said one or more wind turbine blades are controlled in response to said<br>
comparison in order to keep said at least one physical work property below said at<br>
least one predefined limit.<br>
Hereby, a control system for controlling a wind turbine during malfunction in an<br>
electric utility grid is established without the above-mentioned disadvantage.<br>
The invention also relates to a wind turbine in which said wind turbine further<br>
comprises<br>
a control system for comparison of said at least one physical work property and at<br>
least one predefined limit, and<br><br>
means for controlling one or more wind turbine blades O in a time period of said<br>
malfunction in order to keep said least one physical work property below said at least<br>
one predefined limit.<br>
Hereby, an advantageous wind turbine is established which may stay connected to a<br>
utility grid during malfunction in the grid.<br>
The invention also relates to a family of wind turbines such as one or more parks of<br>
wind turbines connected and supplying electric energy to a utility grid, said family<br>
comprising<br>
at least two wind turbines each with one or more controllable rotor blades,<br>
means for detecting a malfunction in said electric utility grid,<br>
means for monitoring at least one physical work property of at least one component<br>
of said at least two wind turbines,<br>
a central control system for comparison of said at least one physical work property<br>
and at least one predefined limit,<br>
means for controlling said one or more wind turbine blades of one or more of said at<br>
least two wind turbines in a time period of said malfunction in order to keep said at<br>
least one physical work property below said at least one predefined limit.<br>
As power fluctuations from utility grid switching are a large problem with increased<br>
utility deregulation and less utility company cooperation, it is advantageous to be<br>
able to control parks of wind turbines centrally and especially ensure that the parks<br>
are not disconnected unnecessarily during malfunctions. Fewer changes during<br>
malfunctions also make it easier to control the stability of the utility grid from a<br>
central place.<br><br>

Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a modern wind turbine 1 with a tower 2 and a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
positioned on top of the tower. The wind turbine rotor 5, comprising three wind<br>
turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through the low speed shaft which extends<br>
out of the nacelle front.<br>
As illustrated in the figure, wind beyond a certain level will activate the rotor due to<br>
the lift induced on the blades and allow it to rotate in a perpendicular direction to the<br>
wind. The rotation movement is converted to electric power, which is supplied to the<br>
utility grid.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the connection for a wind turbine to a utility grid in order to supply<br>
electric energy to consumers.<br>
The wind turbine 1 comprises the wind turbine rotor 5 in which the angle of each<br>
blade is controlled in order to achieve a preferred power production during normal<br><br>
use. The rotor is connected to the electric generator 7 through the low and high speed<br>
shaft separated by the gear means 6. The generated electric power is transferred to a<br>
three phase transformer 12 through three phases comprising impedances 8 with a<br>
value Z. The transformer 12 ensures that the generated voltage is stepped up to the<br>
grid voltage, such as from a generated voltage of few hundred volts AC to the<br>
thousands of volts AC of the utility grid 13.<br>
The figure further illustrates that a malfunction 14 has occurred somewhere in the<br>
utility grid e.g. in form of a significant voltage drop. The malfunction results in a<br>
voltage drop at the wind turbine and thus also in a raising current from the wind<br>
turbine if the power generation is maintained. In order to protect; the wind turbine<br>
from grid malfunctions, the turbine is usually disconnected from the utility grid by<br>
disconnection switches 10. The disconnection switches 10 are controlled by a<br>
detection system 11 which detects voltage or current changes in the utility grid at the<br>
wind turbine. In the event of a malfunction resulting in a voltage or current change<br>
above a limit, the three phases are opened by the switches and the wind turbine is<br>
thus disconnected from the utility grid.<br>
At the grid disconnection of the wind turbine, the generated power may be short<br>
circuited through the three impedances 8 by switches 9 comprising two anti-parallel<br>
thyristors per phase. The power generation of the wind turbine is quickly terminated<br>
at the grid disconnection by pitching the blades out of the wind and stopping the<br>
wind turbine.<br>
After the detection system 11 has detected that the situation of the utility grid is back<br>
to normal the wind turbine may be started again by releasing the mechanical brakes<br>
and pitching the blades into the wind again.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a voltage and current development at a wind turbine<br>
connected to a utility grid with a malfunction.<br><br>
The grid voltage has a nominal voltage value of U but may under normal conditions<br>
vary (at or in proximity of the wind turbine) with a percentage value +/- A % of U<br>
without a disconnection of the wind turbine as consequence.<br>
In the figure, it is illustrated how the value of the grid voltage suddenly starts to drop<br>
and at tmal the detection system 11 detects that the voltage has dropped below the<br>
limit corresponding to the value -  % of U.<br>
During the voltage drop the current I delivered from the wind turbine is rising due to<br>
the fact that the wind turbine is generating the same amount of power P (= U * I - &gt;<br>
I = P / U = &gt; falling U at constant P results in raising I). The current I will be on the<br>
raise until the voltage drops below the limit and the wind turbine is disconnected.<br>
Hereafter, the current I will drop to nil after the wind turbine has been stopped and<br>
the last current is dumped in the impedances Z.<br>
A malfunction may be shorter or longer in duration but is usually measured in few<br>
seconds. Further, the significance of a malfunction may vary e.g. from full grid<br>
blackout to smaller voltage drops or peaks.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a wind turbine 1 with a control system 16 in a preferred embodiment<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The control system is connected to the different components of the wind turbine such<br>
as the wind turbine rotor and the pitch control of the rotor blades, the gear means, the<br>
generator, a frequency converter, the transformer and the disconnection switches.<br>
The control system detects one or more physical work properties of at least one<br>
component of the wind turbine in the malfunction period of the utility grid in order to<br>
avoid or delay the disconnection by controlling the wind turbine components such as<br>
the pitch angle of the rotor blades.<br><br>
The control system allows the power generation of the wind turbine to be controlled<br>
in connection with a malfunction while the physical work properties of at least one<br>
component of the wind turbine are under surveillance. When the malfunction is<br>
detected the control system controls the level of power generation until the<br>
malfunction disappears or at least one of the physical work properties rises above a<br>
predefined limit. In the event of a physical work property crosses the limit, the wind<br>
turbine is disconnected from the utility grid and the wind turbine is stopped. The<br>
control system may be the normal control system for the wind turbine which<br>
comprises further functionalities and is used differently during malfunctions or a<br>
separate control system which takes over from the normal control system during<br>
malfunctions.<br>
As the malfunction of the utility grid may initiate a higher current I from the wind<br>
turbine generator, it is especially important to detect the temperature of the<br>
components. The temperature will begin to go up due to the more power absorbed by<br>
the components (PComp = Imal2 * Rcomp = &gt; higher I = more power absorbed in the<br>
components). The temperature in one or more of the wind turbine components is an<br>
example of a physical work property. Further, the current or the grid voltage may be<br>
used as examples of a physical work property - alone or in connection with the<br>
temperature of the components.<br>
The detection for a grid malfunction may be performed continuously or<br>
discontinuously e.g. every half second.<br>
Further, the malfunction may be detected indirectly by measuring the temperature in<br>
one or more of the wind turbine components and assuming that a rising temperature<br>
above a limit is the result of a malfunction in the utility grid.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates schematically the connection between the different components of<br>
the wind turbine 1 and a control system 16.<br><br>
The section inside the smaller dotted line shows different components of the wind<br>
turbine that may be subject for detection of physical work properties during a<br>
malfunction. Some of the components are part of the electric generation system of<br>
the wind turbine such as the electric generator, the transformer and the generator<br>
control circuits. The generator control circuits may be one or more frequency<br>
converters adapting the frequency of the generated power to the grid frequency. The<br>
rest of the components are part of the mechanical system such as the gearing means.<br>
The electric components all comprise electric resistance in which the power will be<br>
absorbed with a temperature rise as result. The electric components comprise<br>
different cooling means such as cooling ribs, ventilators and means for circulating<br>
water through the components as a cooling medium in order to control the<br>
temperature of the component.<br>
The temperature may be measured in the components as a direct measurement in the<br>
component e.g. temperature sensors in critical places or as an indirect measurement<br>
e.g. in the cooling medium after having flown through the component. Other physical<br>
work properties may be measured with the necessary sensor e.g. voltage or current<br>
sensors.<br>
The measured values for the physical work properties are transferred to the control<br>
system through connections 23a together with utility grid values such as supplied<br>
current and grid voltage. The control system may process the values in different<br>
ways in order to establish signals to control the power generation of the wind turbine<br>
during the malfunction. The process may simply involve comparison between the<br>
values and predefined limit values in which the limits indicate the crossing from safe<br>
operation to operation that may harm the lifespan of the component in question and<br>
thus indicating a disconnection of the wind turbine from the utility grid is<br>
appropriate.<br><br>
The process may also involve a number of intermediate limits each indicating a<br>
lesser safe operation until the limit of harmful operation is reached. Each limit<br>
crossing may result in a control signal controlling the power generation of the wind<br>
turbine during the malfunction e.g. a successive reduction of the power generation<br>
while the temperature continues to rise in a component.<br>
Further, the process may use different mathematical formulas e.g. in order to<br>
determine the rate of increase in a physical work property. If the rate becomes to<br>
steep the control system may respond to this even if no limit has been crossed.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the control system 16 in connection with<br>
a wind turbine comprising a double-fed electric asynchronous generator 7.<br>
The generator comprises a stator 7a, connected to the utility grid through the three<br>
phased transformer 12. The rotor 7b of the generator is mechanically driven by the<br>
rotor 5 through the low speed shaft, the gearing means 6 and the high speed shaft.<br>
Further, the rotor is electrically connected to generator control circuits such as a<br>
frequency converter 17. The frequency converter includes a rectifier to rectify the<br>
AC voltage of the generator to a DC voltage, a DC link to smoothen the DC voltage<br>
and an inverter to change the DC voltage to an AC voltage again with a preferred<br>
frequency. The resulting AC voltage with the preferred frequency is transferred to<br>
the utility grid through the transformer.<br>
The disconnection switches and the pitch of the rotor blades are controlled by the<br>
control system according to the invention on the basis of the measured voltage,<br>
current and/or temperature values /. The figure illustrates how the temperature<br>
values may be measured in different components such as the rotor or stator of the<br>
electric generator, the transformer, the generator control circuits and the gearing<br>
means e.g. in the gearing oil.<br><br>
Figs. 7a to 7d illustrate examples of curves of temperature and power generation<br>
from a wind turbine at a changing pitch in connection with a malfunction of a utility<br>
grid.<br>
Fig. 7a illustrates an example of the temperature development of a wind turbine<br>
component and the power generation during the connection to the utility grid at<br>
normal functionality as well as malfunction in the grid.<br>
The temperature curve is illustrated as horizontal during normal functionality of the<br>
utility grid. However, at the time of malfunction the temperature starts to rise due to<br>
dropping grid voltage and rising current while the power generation by the generator<br>
of the wind turbine is kept constant.<br>
After the start of the malfunction the pitch angle of the rotor blades may be changed<br>
and thus lowering the power generation, as illustrated in fig. 7b, in order to control<br>
the temperature rise. This is illustrated as the temperature curve stabilizing at a<br>
higher level but below a limit Tmax (indicating with a dotted line the highest<br>
acceptable temperature in the component).<br>
Fig. 7b illustrates the curves of power generation and pitch angle a corresponding to<br>
the temperature development in the component as illustrated in fig. 7a.<br>
The pitch curve only illustrates the pitch being lowered once from an optimal value<br>
during normal power generation to a lower value in order to stabilize the temperature<br>
of a wind turbine component such as the temperature of the generator.<br>
The pitch may be lowered instantaneously from the optimal value to a lower value<br>
e.g. from a value resulting in 100 % generator production to 30 % and subsequently<br>
disconnected if too high temperatures occur. Further, the pitch value may be lowered<br>
in smaller steps or continuously e.g. in response to detected temperature rising in a<br><br>
component until the temperature stabilizes or the value of the pitch reaches a lower<br>
limit in which the wind turbine is disconnected from the grid.<br>
Fig. 7c illustrates the power curve as substantially horizontal during the normal<br>
situation but it should be understood that the production may change e.g. in<br>
connection with fluctuations in wind speed and grid demand.<br>
At time tmal a malfunction occurs in the utility grid e.g. a drop in the grid voltage<br>
beyond the predefined limits in the control system of the wind turbine. The control<br>
system detects the values of a physical work property and in response hereto starts to<br>
change the pitch angle of the rotor blades in order to reduce the power generation of<br>
the wind turbine (illustrated with the slightly declining curve). After a time period<br>
the values cross a limit and the control system disconnects the wind turbine from the<br>
grid. At the disconnection, the power generation of the wind turbine is stopped as<br>
indicated with the substantially vertical curve. The power generation is kept at hold<br>
until the malfunction is removed from the utility grid and the wind turbine may be<br>
connected to the utility grid once more.<br>
Fig. 7d illustrates another example in which the power generation is maintained<br>
during the malfunction at a lower level in which the values are detected and<br>
compared with the limit. After the removal of the malfunction the power generation<br>
is once more re-established at its full level.<br>
The different temperature values may be logged in memory means of the control<br>
system such as a temperature value logged every 5 or every 30 minutes. The values<br>
can subsequently be used in determining the lifetime effect on the wind turbine<br>
component by the temperature rise.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a more detailed example of temperature measurement in an electric<br>
generator.<br><br>
The asynchronous generator comprises at least a hollow stator in which cooling<br>
medium is flowing. The cooling medium is transferred from a container 21 with<br>
pumping means 20 through pipes to an inlet of the hollow stator 19. In the hollow<br>
stator the medium is circulated in cavities of the stator in order to cool the internal<br>
surfaces of the stator and indirectly the rotor surrounded by the stator. The heated<br>
medium is subsequently let out of the stator to exterior cooling means before<br>
reentering the stator again.<br>
Temperature measurements may be obtained by placing sensors in the cooling<br>
medium as the medium leaving the stator gives an indirect indication of the<br>
temperature in the stator as well as the rotor. Further, standard temperature sensors<br>
positioned inside the stator and rotor may obtain the necessary temperature<br>
measurements. Even further, the temperature measurements may be obtained by<br>
other temperature measuring methods such as detecting the infrared radiation from<br>
different location of the generator.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a more detailed example of temperature measurement in a frequency<br>
converter.<br>
As explained above the frequency converter 17 comprises a rectifier 17a, a DC link<br>
17b and an inverter 17c in which the rectifier and the inverter are established with<br>
thyristors or similar semiconductor switches. The thyristors of the rectifier and<br>
especially the inverter are controlled in well-known ways in order to establish the<br>
preferred AC voltage and frequency to the utility grid.<br>
A resistor in the DC link may be used as dump load for any power generated after the<br>
disconnection of the wind turbine. The resistor as well as the thyristors are preferably<br>
air or water-cooled. By measuring the temperature positioned on the thyristors with<br>
temperature sensors, it is possible to establish an indication of the temperature in the<br>
semiconductor material of the thyristors. Further, it is also possible to measure the<br>
temperature indirectly by placing sensors in the air or water flow from the thyristors.<br><br>
The figure also illustrates the asynchronous double fed generator with temperature<br>
measurements in rotor and stator.<br>
The temperature measurements are preferably compensated in the control system for<br>
consequences of any very high or low ambient temperature.<br>
Figs. 10a and 10b illustrate a method according to the invention of controlling a wind<br>
turbine connected to an electric utility grid during a malfunction in the grid.<br>
The method comprises the steps of:<br>
•	Connecting a wind turbine to the utility grid and controlling the power generation<br>
with a control system.<br>
•	Detecting the grid conditions with the control system such as the grid voltage at<br>
the wind turbine connection.<br>
•	Comparing the values with a first predefined limit in order to determine the<br>
malfunction e.g. a voltage drop above +/- 5 percent. If the values are below the<br>
limit, the wind turbine is operated normally.<br>
•	Comparing the detected malfunction values with the second predefined limits in<br>
order to determine the significance of the malfunction e.g. a full blackout of the<br>
grid requesting an immediate disconnection of the wind turbine from the grid.<br>
•	Detecting different temperatures of the components in the wind turbine.<br>
•	Lowering the power production of the wind turbine by changing the pitch of the<br>
rotor blades as a result of said temperature measurements.<br><br>
Comparing the temperature with predefined limits for the temperature in the<br>
components. The power generation is maintained at the lower level during the<br>
malfunction until the temperature rises too much in which the pitch is once more<br>
changed in order to lower the power generation further. The wind turbine may be<br>
disconnected from the grid by the control system if the temperature detecting<br>
indicates that the temperature development is close to a harmful level.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a family of wind turbines, which may be an offshore or onshore<br>
park of wind turbines with a common connection 24 to the utility grid 13. The<br>
connection includes switches 10 for connecting or disconnecting the park from the<br>
grid in which the switches is controlled by a central control system 16 during a<br>
malfunction in the grid. The control system is supplied with detected values of<br>
physical work properties in different components in each of the wind turbines e.g. the<br>
temperature of the components and the current supplied from the wind turbine. The<br>
values are used in controlling the power generation from the wind turbines by<br>
changing the pitch angle of the rotor blades in the relevant wind turbines and/or by<br>
disconnecting one or more of the wind turbines in the park. By using a central<br>
control system in detecting relevant values of physical work properties and changing<br>
the power generation from the wind turbines of the park it is possible to maintain the<br>
park connected to the utility grid in a malfunction situation.<br>
The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
examples described above but may be used in connection with a wide variety of<br>
applications such as different wind turbine types in which the rotor blades may be<br>
controlled e.g. types involving pitch or active stall. Further, it should be understood<br>
that especially the control system according to the invention may be designed in a<br>
multitude of varieties within the scope of the invention as specified in the claims.<br>
Especially, the detected physical work properties may be measured in any preferred<br>
location of the component by any possible measuring method and means.<br><br>
