				<td>The compound (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile is useful in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases which are related with the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC.3.4.14.5, abbreviated in the following as DPP-IV). In WO 03/037327, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the preparation of (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile as well as the uses of this compound have been disclosed. In particular, (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylarnino]-acetyl}-pyrro]idine-2-carbonitrile is an inhibitor of DPP-IV and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases which are associated with DPP-IV, such as diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, bowl disease, colitis ulcerosa, morbus crohn, obesity, and/or metabolic syndrome. The compound can further be used as a diuretic agent or for use as therapeutic active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hypertension. (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyi-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamine]-acetyl}-pyiTolidine-2-carbonitrile is characterized by formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It has now been found that a specific salt of (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl} -pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile, particularly (S)-1 -{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitri!e mesylate, exhibits unexpected advantages compared to (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile. Furthermore, three crystalline polymorphs of (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyI-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate have been found, which also exhibit unexpected advantages.<br>
Polymorphism is defined as the ability of a substance to crystallize in more than one crystal lattice arrangement. Polymorphism can influence many aspects of solid<br>
state properties of a drug. Different cryslal modifications of a substance may differ considerably from one another in many respects such as their solubility, dissolution rate and finally bioavailability. An exhaustive treatment of polymorphism in pharmaceutical and molecular crystals is given e.g. by Byrn (Byrn, S.R., Pfeiffer, R.R., Stowell, J.G., ,,Solid-State Chemistry of Drugs", SSCI Inc., West Lafayette, Indiana, 1999), Brittain, H.G., polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids", Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, 1999) or Bernstein (Bernstein, J., ,,Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals", Oxford University Press, 2002).<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate exhibits various unexpected advantages, e.g. in context with chemical stability, mechanical properties, processability, solubility, dissolution, bioavailability, toxicology or pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
Surprisingly, it has further been found that (S)-l-([2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate can exist in four polymorphic forms, designated as polymorph A, polymorph B, polymorph C and polymorph D, which exhibit various unexpected advantages, e.g. in context with chemical stability, mechanical properties, processability, solubility, dissolution, bioavailability or pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides the novel compound (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate and three novel crystalline polymorph of (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate, which unexpectedly exhibit desirable and improved pharmacological properties when compared to the known compound (S)-1 - {[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl}-pvrrolidine-2-carbonitrile.<br>

It has been observed that the polymorph B is hygroscopic and that the X-ray powder diffraction pattern and the IR-spectrum of polymorph B can vary, depending on the humidity of the analyzed sample. Water uptake and release, respectively, result in systematic shifts of some peak positions in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. The<br>
crystal form B is characterized by a set of peaks, as described above, that are not susceptible to peak shifts in a range larger than 0.2 degrees in 2-theta. Samples of polymorph B, which have been dried, e.g. by elevated temperature or in a dry atmosphere, show the same X-ray powder diffraction pattern. In the IR spectrum of polymorph B, variations of humidity of the sample are mainly observed in following regions : 3700-3300, 1250-1150,1045-1000 970-955, 900-850 cm'1. However, changes of humidity can also have an influence on the position of the peaks outside these ranges.<br>
Figure 4 shows the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a dried sample of polymorph B. Figure 3 shows the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a sample of polymorph B, which has been exposed to ambient humidity. Figure 5 shows the IR-spectrum of a dried sample of polymorph B. Figure 6 shows the IR-spectrum of a sample of polymorph B, which has been exposed to ambient humidity.<br>
Polymorph B can also be characterized by its single crystal structure. The X-ray structures of a crystal of polymorph B under dry conditions and in ambient humidity demonstrate that both belong to the same space group P21 and have the same crystal packing and have crystal lattice parameters that differ less than 2%. Therefore the crystals are isomorphous. The occupancy of the hydrate water molecule was refined to 27% in the dried crystal and 59% in the crystal measured at ambient conditions. The only difference between the crystal structures of dried and ambient polymorph B is a slight rearrangement of the mesylate. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns calculated from the two crystal structures superimpose well with the corresponding experimental X-ray powder diffraction patterns measured from ambient and dried polymorph B. Crystal data from a dried and a humid single crystal of polymorph B are summarized in table 1 below.<br>

Examples<br>
X-ray Powder Diffraction<br>
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded with a STOE Stadi P X-ray diffractometer in transmission mode (Cu Kα l radiation, Ge-monochromator, position sensitive detector (PSD), angular range 3° to 42° 2Theta, steps of 0.5° 2Theta, measuring time 40 seconds per step). The samples were prepared and analyzed without further processing (e.g. grinding or sieving) of the substance. For obtaining the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the dried sample, powder in an unsealed glass capillary was stored in a hot-stage device attached to the STOE Stadi P diffractometer at 80 °C for 24 hours. Then the capillary was immediately sealed with epoxy resin and measured at ambient temperature (20 - 25°C).<br>

The Spectrometer is a Nicolet 20SXB or equivalent (resolution 2 cm"1, 32 or more coadded scans, MCT detector).<br>
Growth and X-ray Structure Analysis of Single Crystals<br>
To obtain single crystals for structure analysis, 200 mg of (S)-l-{[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethylamino]-acetyl} -pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile mesylate were dissolved in a mixture of 3.88 mL 2-propanol and 120 µL water at 50 °C. The solution was transferred via a 0.2 µm filter into 10 mL glass vial. The vial was then closed and was put into a 1 L water bath with at temperature of 45 °C. The system was allowed to reach ambient temperature passively. After 2 days single crystals were harvested for x-ray data collection. The crystals were mounted in glass capillaries and sealed with epoxy resin at the normal ambient conditions in the laboratory. For obtaining the structure of the dried crystal, crystals in an unsealed glass capillary were stored in a vacuum dryer at 5 mbar and 40 °C for 12 days. Then the capillary was removed from the incubator and sealed immediately with epoxy resin.<br>

The autoclave was closed and ammonia (200 g, 11.74 mol) was transferred into the suspension at -20 °C to 20 °C while stirring and cooling. The mixture was then heated to 75 °C - 80 °C and the pressure rose to 10 bar. The mixture was stirred for 2 - 3 h at this temperature and then cooled down to 20 °C. The pressure was relieved and the clear solution was transferred with the aid of 100 mL of methanol to a 1000 mL double jacketed glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a Pt-100 thermometer, a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel and a nitrogen inlet. The solvent was completely removed by distillation under vacuum. The resulting suspension was twice treated with 500 mL of methylenechloride that was subsequently completely removed by distillation under normal pressure. The residue was again treated with 500 mL of methylenechloride and the resulting suspension was cooled to 0 °C within 1 h and stirred for another 2 h at this temperature. The precipitate was filtered with suction, the filter cake was washed with 200 mL of methylenechloride and dried under vacuum (50 °C, 50 mbar) to afford about 85.8 g (yield 78%, 96%(m/m) purity based on HPLC assay) of 2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethytammonium mesylate as a colorless solid.
