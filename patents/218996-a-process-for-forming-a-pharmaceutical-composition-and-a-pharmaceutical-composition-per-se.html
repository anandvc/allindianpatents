Pharmaceutical Composition of Topiramate<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority from United States provisional application Serial<br>
No. 60/076,770. filed March 4. 1998, the contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a solid dosage formulation of topiramate<br>
and process for producing the solid dosage formulation. More particularly, the<br>
solid dosage formulation comprises core particles which are coated with a taste<br>
mask coating to provide coated particles which can be sprinkled onto food to ease<br>
administration to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules, e.g.,<br>
pediatnc patients.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The pnarmaceutical industry employs a variety of dosage formulations for<br>
orally administering medicinal agents to patients. Typical formulations for oral<br>
administration include liquid solutions, emulsions, or suspensions, as well as sotid<br>
forms such as capsu.es or tablets (as used herein, the term "tablet" means any<br>
shaped and compressed solid dosage form, including caplets). Since these<br>
conventional solid dosage formulations are usually intended for adults who can<br>
easily swallow large tablets whole, the often disagreeable taste of the active<br>
ingredient need not be taken into account in formulating the medicine, except for<br>
the provision of means to prevent the taste from being apparent during the short<br>
time that the medicine is in the mouth. Such means may include the provision of<br>
an appropriate coating on the tablet, the use of a capsule form (the gelatin outer<br>
shell of the capsule keeps the active ingredient inside until the capsule has been<br>
swallowed) or smoky firmly compressing a tablet so that it will not begin to<br>
disintegrate during the short time that it is intended to be in the mouth.<br>
Children, older persons, ana many other persons have difficulty swallowing<br>
whole tablets and even capsules. Therefore, it is often desirable to provide the<br>
medicine either in liquid form or in a chewable solid form or an alternative solid<br>
form, e.g., small particles which can be sprinkled onto soft food and swallowed<br>
intact with the food, in addition to tne tablet or capsule intended to be swallowed<br>
whole. Even where the medicine can be formulated as a liquid, it is desirable to<br>
provide a chewabie solid form or an alternative solid form such as microspheres<br>
which can be sprinkled onto soft food (e.g., baby food) because it is often more<br>
convenient and easier to administer.<br>
A major requirement of any such solid form is that it must be palatable,<br>
since an unpalatable formulation greatly increases the risk of a patient neglecting<br>
to take a medication. A further requirement of any solid dosage form is that it<br>
must be bioavailable; that is, once the formulation reaches the stomach, the<br>
individual particles should release the active ingredient rapidly and completely to<br>
ensure that substantially ail of the active ingredient is absorbed. In cases where<br>
the active ingredient is particularly unpalatable and somewhat unstable, it may be<br>
difficult if not impossible, to identify a solid form that fulfills both of these<br>
requirements (i.e., palatable and broavailable).<br>
A number of references are known which describe pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of unpalatable medicinal agents which are coated with a taste<br>
masking coating in order to hide the unpleasant taste. Julian et al., in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,851,266, describe chewable medicament tablets made by coating granules<br>
of a medicament (especially, acetyl p-aminophenol) with a blend of cellulose<br>
acetate or cellulose acetate butyrate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (also known as<br>
"PVP" and referred to hereinafter by its United States Pharmacopeia (USP) name<br>
as "povidone"). Mehta, in U.S. Patent No. 5,084,278, discloses a pharmaceutical<br>
composition composed of a pharmaceutical core of an active dose of a compound<br>
and a rnicroencapsulating polymer which coats the pharmaceutical core and is<br>
capable of taste-masking tne active compound. Bhardway, et al., in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5.578,316. describe medicament cores coated with methacryiate ester<br>
capolymers which mask the bitter and unpleasant taste of the medicament<br>
A variety of chlorosulfate and sulfamate esters of 2,3:4,5-bis-O-(1 -<br>
methylethylidene)-ß-D-fructopyranose and their anticonvulsant activity in<br>
mammals, ana thus their utility in treating diseases such as epilepsy and<br>
glaucoma, are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,513,006. More specifically, the<br>
compound 2,3:4,5-bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-ß-D-fructopyranose sulfamate.<br>
hereinafter referred to as "topiramate", is presently available for marketing as a<br>
tablet product in strengths of 25, 50,100, 200, 300 and 400 mg as adjunctive<br>
therapy for the treatment of adults with partial onset seizures (TOPAMAX®<br>
(topiramate) tablets). Topiramate can be prepared following the processes<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,513,006 and 5,387,700, and preferably, by the<br>
process described in Examples 1 to 3 of U.S. Patent No. 5,387,700. Difficulty in<br>
identifying a chewable solid form of topiramate has ensued due to the extremely<br>
bitter taste of topiramate and problems associated with stability of the active agent,<br>
especially upon exposure to moisture and heat which are known to cause<br>
degradation of topiramate Degradation of topiramate is readily detected by<br>
changes in physical appearance, i.e.. discoloration to brown or black, and by the<br>
formation of sulfate ions which can be readily detected by standard techniques<br>
know to those of ordinary skill in the an (e.g. HPLC).<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a stable solid<br>
formulation of topiramate for use in children and other patients who have difficulty<br>
swallowing conventional solid forms (e.g., tablets, capsules) which is both<br>
palatable and bioavailable it is a further object of the invention to provide a<br>
palatable solid formulation of topiramate that can be sprinkled onto soft food prior<br>
to consumption (i.e., a "sprinkle formulation") and which provides immediate<br>
release of the active ingredient in the stomach.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a solid dosage formulation of topiramate<br>
intended primanly for pediatnc use or for patients who cannot swallow tablets.<br>
More particularly, the solid dosage formulation is a sprinkle formulation comprising<br>
core particles of the active agent which is taste-masked with a second layer to<br>
obscure the extremely bitter taste of topiramate. The core particles can compnse<br>
topiramate alone, e.g., in granular or crystalline form, or topiramate and one or<br>
more excipients which are then formed into granules or beads by techniques<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art e.g., roller compaction and comminution,<br>
extrusion-spheronization or other methods of forming granules or beaas. The<br>
preferred solid dosage formulation of the present invention is in the form of<br>
microspheres which may be sprinkled onto soft food (e.g., baby food) and<br>
swallowed by the patient along with the food.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, three strengths, 15, 25, and 50 mg, are<br>
obtained from a single sprinkle formulation of topiramate coated onto sugar<br>
spheres using povidone as a binder, and taste-masked with a coating of cellulose<br>
acetate and povidone to form coated beads. The strengths are differentiated by<br>
means of diffenng fill weights and of proportional capsule sizes. That is, to aid in<br>
delivery of the appropriate dosage to the patient, an amount of coated beads<br>
sufficient to deliver the desired dose may be encapsulated into a capsule, for<br>
example, a size 0, size 1, or size 2 gelatin capsule consisting of a white body with<br>
a natural cap. Black pharmaceutical ink can be utilized to provide product<br>
identification information on the capsules. For pediatric patients, the capsules can<br>
be opened and the contents of the capsules sprinkled onto food and ingested;<br>
however, mature patients may swallow drug product in intact capsules, if desired.<br>
In general, the process for the preparation of the spnnkle formulation<br>
includes a step in which core parades comprising granules, beads or crystals of<br>
topiramate, alone or in combination with one or more excipients are coated with a<br>
taste masking mixture and then dried. The term "particles"" as used herein refers<br>
to free flowing substances of any shape which are larger than a powder including<br>
crystals, beads (smooth, round or spherical particles) and granules. A variety of<br>
methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art of pharmaceutical sciences may<br>
be employed to prepare the core particles comprising the active agent of<br>
topiramate. In one method, granules or large single crystals of topiramate can be<br>
utilized as the core particles and coated with the taste masking mixture. The<br>
coated material formed from the granules or crystals of topiramate may then be<br>
compressed into chewable tablets, if desired or sprinkled onto soft food and<br>
swallowed.<br>
In a second approach, the active agent cf tociramate (in powder form) is<br>
first placed in a fluidized bed equipment and thereafter, a spray binder solution or<br>
suspension compnsed of, for example, povidone. siarch, sugar, syrup, HPMC<br>
among other excipients known to those of ordinary skill in the art in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvent (e.g., water, ethanol, acetone, among others)<br>
is sprayed onto the powder, formed into granules and then dried until the solvent is<br>
evaporated to provide the core particles. The drying temperature may vary over a<br>
broad range, but should not be so high as to render the active agent inactive As a<br>
slight modification of this second approach, a suspension of topiramate and a<br>
binder in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent is sprayed onto sugar spheres in<br>
a fiuidized bed equipment and dried to provide core beads.<br>
In a third method for forming the core particles, powdered or granular active<br>
agent, and diluent or bulking agent are mixed with water or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvent (e.g., water, ethanol) to form a wet mass. The mixture is mixed,<br>
e.g., in a Hobart mixer or other suitable mixer, until a wet mass or dough is formed.<br>
The wet mass is then placed in an extruder and extruded as a long thin strand.<br>
The mixture may then be dried and suitably comminuted or may be placed in a<br>
suitable spheronizer to make a pharmaceutical core that is round followed by<br>
drying. The drying temperature may vary over a broad range, but should not be so<br>
high as to render the active agent inactive.<br>
Still another approach for forming the core particles is by roller compaction<br>
of topiramate, either alone or in combination with one or more excipients. For<br>
example, topiramate in powdered or granular form can be mixed with excipient to<br>
provide suitable binding and lubricity, for example microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
magnesium stearate or talc among others, and then passed through a compactor<br>
to compact the mixture into a mass. The mass is then passed through a size<br>
reduction machine and reduced to a suitable particle size to provide the core<br>
panicles.<br>
As used herein, the term "topiramate" and "active agent of topiramate" are<br>
synonymous and are used interchangeably throughout the specification to refer to<br>
the compound 2,3:4,5-bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-ß- fructopyranose sulfamate<br>
which forms the active agent of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention. Topiramate and its use for treating epilepsy and glaucoma are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4.513,006. Topiramate can be synthesized<br>
according to the processes disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,513,006 and<br>
5,387,700, and preferably, according to the process of Examples 1-3 of U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,387,700.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a<br>
researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated.<br>
The term "excipient," as used herein, refers to any inert substance which<br>
may be combined with an active agent for preparing convenient dosage forms,<br>
including, for example, diluents, binders, lubricants, disintegrants. colors, flavors<br>
and sweeteners.<br>
Suitable diluents for use in the formulation and processes of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate,<br>
lactose,sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, dry<br>
starch, powdered sugar and sugar spheres. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, sugar spheres (20-60 mesh, preferably, 20-40 mesh, most preferably,<br>
20-24 mesh) are utilized as a diluent in the core beads. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, sugar spheres NF (20/25 mesh) available from Crompton &amp; Knowles<br>
Corporation as NU-PAREIL PG® are used.<br>
Suitable binders for use in the instant formulation and processes include,<br>
but are not limited to synthetic gums such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose<br>
("HPMC"), povidone, carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose and methyl-cellulose,<br>
starch, pregelatinized starch, geiatin, sugars (e.g., molasses) and naturae gums<br>
(e.g., acacia gum. sodium alginate, panwar gum). Preferably, povidone<br>
(especially, Povidone USP) is used as the binder. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the povidone is PLASDONE® (K29/32) supplied by ISP<br>
Technologies, Inc. as a manufacturer of GAF products.<br>
Disintegrants which can be utilized in the formulation and processes of the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, methylcellulose, cellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium aluminum silicate,<br>
povidone, starch, sodium starch glycolate, pregelatinized starch, alginic acid and<br>
guar gum. Preferably, the disintegrant is povidone. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the povidone is PLASDONE® (K29/32) supplied by ISP<br>
Technologies, Inc. as a manufacturer of GAF products.<br>
Suitable taste masking agents which can be used in the formulation and<br>
processes include, but are not limited to, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate<br>
butyrate, ethylcellulose. methylcellulose (including ethylcellulose and<br>
methylcellulose combinations), and a wide range of copolymers available under<br>
the tradename of Eudragits (Rohm Pharma of Darmstadt Germany). In a<br>
preferred embodiment the taste masking agent s cellulose acetate (Cellulose<br>
Acetate, NF).<br>
A variety of solvents may be used as the first and second solvent in the<br>
processes for preparing the pharmaceutical composition. Suitable solvents<br>
include, but are not limited to, water, acetone, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol), methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and mixtures<br>
thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the first solvent used for forming the core<br>
beads is water, and the second solvent used for coating the core beads with the<br>
taste masking mixture is an acetone-alcohol mixture, preferably, an acetone-<br>
ethanol mixture, more preferably. an acetone-dehydrated alcohol mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a suspension of topiramate ana a binder in a<br>
first solvent is sprayed onto sugar spneres (20-25 mesh) and dried to provide core<br>
beads. The core beads are then screened to remove fines and agglomerates.<br>
The core beads are coated again with a taste masking mixture and then dried.<br>
The taste masking mixture, which is sprayed onto the core beads, compnses a<br>
taste masking agent and a disintegrant dissolved or suspended in a second<br>
solvent, which may be the same or different from the first solvent. Coated beads<br>
are sifted to remove fines and agglomerates, prior to encapsulation.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the process for preparing the<br>
sprinkle formulation, a suspension of topiramate in a solution of povidone in<br>
purified water is sprayed onto sugar spheres (20-25 mesh) and dried in a fluid bed<br>
processor equipped with a Wurster column. The ratio of topiramate: povidone<br>
utilized in the suspension can be 50:25, 50:30 or 50:35. Preferably, a 50:25 ratio<br>
of topiramate povidone is used. The core beads then are screened to remove<br>
fines and agglomerates such that the core beads have a particle size between<br>
about 0.100 mm and about 2.5 mm, preferably, between about 0.5 mm and about<br>
1.5 mm, most preferably, between about 0.710 mm and about 1.18 mm. The core<br>
beads are coated again with a taste masking mixture of cellulose acetate and<br>
povidone suspended in an acetone/alcohol mixture in a fluid bed unit equipped<br>
with a Wurster column, and dried. The ratio of cellulose acetate/povidone in the<br>
taste masking mixture can be 60/40. 50/50, 65/35 or 55/45, preferably, a 65/35<br>
ratio of cellulose acetate/povidone is utilized. Coated beads are sifted to remove<br>
fines and agglomerates to provide a final particle size between about 0.100 mm<br>
and about 2.5 mm, preferabiy. between about 0.5 mm and about 1.5 mm, most<br>
preferaably, between about 0.850mm and about 1.18 mm. The coated beads are<br>
packaged (e.g., in capsules, sachets or other methods known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art) to deliver the desired amount of active ingredient to the patient.<br>
When a particle size range is specified for the core and/or coated particles<br>
(e.g., between about 0.100 mm and about 2.5 mm), it is intended that at least 75%.<br>
preferably, 85%, and most preferaDly, 95% of the particles have a particle size<br>
falling within the specified range (e.g., about 0.100 mm and about 2.5 mm).<br>
The invention will be described more specifically in terms of its preferred<br>
embodiment which is the preparation of a sprinkle formulation of topiramate. In<br>
the first step of the process, core beads are prepared by coating sugar spheres<br>
(20-25 mesh) with a suspension of topiramate and povidone in water. More<br>
particuiaf1y, the sugar spheres are placed in a fluidized bed coater and fluidized by<br>
a flow of warm air. The temperature of the air has not been found to be narrowly<br>
critical, and can vary over a wide range, however, the temperature should not be<br>
high enough to cause decomposition, sintering, or melting of the sugar spheres.<br>
When coating the sugar spheres with the topiramate/povidone suspension<br>
(preferably, a 50:25 ratio), a temperature from about 50° to 75°C has been found<br>
to be suitable. The rate of air flow is adjusted so as to fluidize the sugar spheres.<br>
Such flow will vary depending on factors such as the specific equipment used, the<br>
size of the individual sugar spheres, the size of the charge of sugar spheres, the<br>
apparent specific gravity of the spheres, and other factors known to the worker in<br>
the arts relating to fluidized bed coating. After the sugar spheres have been<br>
fluidized, a previously prepared suspension of topiramate in a solution of povidone<br>
in water is sprayed onto the fluidized bed to provide the core beads. The air flow<br>
through the bed is continued until the amount of water remaining in the topiramate<br>
core beads has been substantially reduced. The core beads are-actually dry to<br>
1ne touch within a very short tone after the topiramate suspension has been<br>
sprayed onto the sugar spheres. However, the total drying time required to ensure<br>
that the water content has been reduced to the desired level may take much<br>
longer, depending on the temperature of the air, the size of the batch and the like<br>
Routine experimentation will suffice to determine the appropriate ar temperatures<br>
and total times required in the fluidized bed coaters in individual cases. The core<br>
beads are sized through a sifter using 16 mesh and 25 mesh screens.<br>
In the second step of the process, the core beads are coated with a taste<br>
masking mixture to provide the coated beads of the sprinkle formulation. More<br>
specifically, the core beads are placed in a fluidized bed coater and fluidized by a<br>
flow of warm air. The temperature of the air nas not been found to be narrowly<br>
critical, and can vary over a wide range, keeping in mind the fact that the<br>
temperature should not be so high as to cause decomposition, sintering, or<br>
melting, of the topiramate core beads. When coating the topiramate core beads, a<br>
temperature of from 30° to 75°C has been found to be suitable. The rate of air<br>
flow is adjusted so as to fluidize the core beads. Such flow will vary depending on<br>
factors such as the specific equipment used the size of the charge of core beads,<br>
the size of the individual core beads, the apparent specific gravity of the core<br>
beads, and other factors known to the worker skilled in the arts of fluidized bed<br>
coating. After the core beads have been fluidized, a taste mask coating mixture is<br>
sprayed onto the fluidized bed. The taste mask coating mixture comprises a<br>
solution of cellulose acetate/povidone (preferably, in a 65:35 ratio) in an acetone-<br>
alcohol (preferably, acetone-dehydrated alcohol) solvent mixture. The air flow<br>
through the bed is continued until the amount of solvent remaining in the coating<br>
has been reduced to part per million levels. The coated beads are actually dried<br>
to the touch within a very short time after the coating solution has been sprayed<br>
onto the topiramate core beads. However, the total drying time required to ensure<br>
that the solvent content of the coating has been reduced to the level desired may<br>
take much longer, depending on the temperature of the air, the size of the batch<br>
and the like. Routine experimentation will suffice to determine the appropriate air<br>
temperature and total times required in the fluidized bed coalers in individuals<br>
cases. The coated beads are then sized through a sifter using 16 mesh ana 20<br>
mesh screens.<br>
A sprinkle formulation having satisfactory taste masking and bioavailability<br>
properties was obtained when the taste mask coating comprises about 7 to about<br>
15% by weight of the final pharmaceutical composition. Preferably the taste mask<br>
coating comprises about 9% by weight to about 13% by weight, most preferably,<br>
about 11 % by weight, of the pharmaceutical composition when dried.<br>
Dissolution results in water indicative of bioavailability for the<br>
Dnarmaceutical composition having between 7 and 15% by weight taste mask<br>
coating are shown below in Table 1.<br>
To aid in delivery of the appropriate dosage to the patient, an<br>
encapsulation machine can be utilized to encapsulate an amount of coated beads<br>
to provide 15 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg strengths of topiramate into a size 2,1 or 0<br>
gelatin capsule, respectively.<br>
While the use of fluidized bed coating has been described in some detail<br>
as one preferred method for making the core beads and the coated beads, other<br>
techniques for making the core and coated beads readily known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art may be used. Such other techniques include various<br>
microencapsulation techniques such as coacervation and solvent evaporation.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the ingredients and amounts of<br>
each ingredient used to prepare the topiratmate sprinkle bead formulation are<br>
provided in Table 2.<br>
The strengths of toptramate sprinkle capsules, 15, 25 and 50 mg are<br>
obtained from a single formulation of topiramate-coated beads by encapsulating<br>
the proportionate amounts of coated beads in appropnately sized and marked<br>
capsules. Table 3 provides a batch formula for a production batch of topiramate<br>
sprinkle bead formulation.<br>
A comparison of dissolution rates in water between TOPAMAX® 100 mg<br>
tablets and topiramate sprinkle capsule formulations, 25 and 50 mg dosages<br>
{according to the specifications of Table 2) are shown in Table 4<br>
The stability of the sprinkle formulation of the present invention was<br>
compared to TOPAMAX® (topiramate) tablets by storing both formulations in<br>
controlled stability chambers for the purpose of determining the stability profile for<br>
the two products. Samples were stored at 30°C. The sprinkles were stored at<br>
60% relative humidity (RH); relative humidity for the tablet batches was either<br>
controlled at 35% RH or was not controlled, but, in any event, was well below 60%<br>
RH. Data were collected for assay (amount of drug remaining), sulfate and<br>
sulfamate. physical appearance at selected time intervals, e.g., 18 months, 24<br>
months. Physical appearance i.e. discoloration to brown or black, and amount of<br>
sulfate detected are good indicators of degradation of the active agent<br>
(topiramate) For each mote of topiramate that degrades, a molar equivalent of<br>
inorganic impurity (sulfate/sulfamate) is formed. The presence of inorganic<br>
impurity is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard<br>
techniques, e.g.. HPLC.<br>
At 18 months, some instability was detected by appearance data for the<br>
tablets, while the sprinkle formulation showed no signs of instability/degradation.<br>
Clear signs of degradation were apparent by appearance and sulfate data for the<br>
tablets at 24 months. After 24 months of storage at 30 degrees 60% RH, the 25<br>
and 50 mg strengths of sprinkle capsules remained stable while the 15 mg<br>
strength showed instability. At 25 degrees 60% RH storage for 24 months, all<br>
three strengths of the sprinkle formulation remained stable.<br>
It is known that moisture accelerates the degradation of topiramate. It has<br>
now been unexpectantly found that the coating used to taste mask the topiramate<br>
core beads also provides a barrier to the absorption of moisture, and therefore,<br>
improves on the stability of the spnnkle forrnuiation. For storage of the tablets, it<br>
was necesssary to put a desiccant into the bottles to stabilize the tablet<br>
formulation. However, there is no need for a dessicant for the sprinkle formulation.<br>
In addition, the capsules which are used to ease delivery of the appropriate<br>
dosage of sprinkles contain more than 10% moisture by weight, and yet, this<br>
moisture does not accelerate the degradation of topiramate because of the taste<br>
mask coating for the sprinkles.<br>
The following examples are provided to further define the invention without<br>
however, limiting the invention to the particulars of these examples.<br>
Batch amounts of each of the core bead ingredients were accurately<br>
weighed out. in a jacketed kettle (approximately 50 gallons) equipped with a<br>
sweeper, a homogenizer (Silverson or equivalent) and a mixer (L1GHTNIN1® or<br>
equivalent) was placed the appropriate batch amount of purified water. USP The<br>
batch amount of Povidone, USP was added and the resulting mixture mixed for a<br>
minimum of 15 minutes to disperse the povidone in the purified water. The<br>
topiramate (37.50kg) was added and the mixture mixed for a minimum of 15<br>
minutes to disperse. Water was passed through the jacket. Using the mixer and<br>
homogenizes the topiramate suspension was homogenized for approximately 90<br>
minutes (range: 80-100 minutes). Stirring was continued through the steps which<br>
follow for preparing the core beads.<br>
A pump (Masterflex or equivalent) was prepared with three pump heads for<br>
spraying. The batch quantity of sugar spheres, NF was charged to a fluid bed<br>
(Glatt Fluid Bed equipped with a 32 inch Wurster column, 3 guns with 2.2 mm<br>
nozzles, or equivalent) The sugar spheres were fluidized and the topiramate<br>
suspension sprayed through the nozzles (approximate spray rate: 1 kg/min;<br>
approximate spray time: 2.25 hours) according to the parameters shown in Table<br>
5.<br>
The core beads were dried at 60°C for at least 15 minutes (range: 15-18<br>
minute) after the bed temperature had reached 60°C (range: 55°C-65°C)<br>
according to the parameters provided in Table 6.<br>
The core beads were then sized through a 48" sifter (Sweco or equivalent),<br>
using 16 mesh and 25 mesh screens to remove fines and agglomerates<br>
The batch quantities of Acetone, NF and Dehydrated Alcohol. USP were<br>
transferred to a suitable stainless steel tank and-mixed. The natch quantity of<br>
Povidone, USP was added using a suitable mixer (LIGHTNIN® or equivalent).<br>
The batch quantity of Cellulose Acetate, NF was added at the vortex while mixing<br>
with a suitable mixer and the coating solution was checked visually for clarity.<br>
The 16/25 mesh topirarnate core beads (150 kg) from Example 1 were<br>
fluidized in a Glatt Fluid Bed processor equipped with a Wurster column (or<br>
equivalent). The core beads were sprayed with the coating solution until the entire<br>
quantity of coating solution was exhausted. The coated beads were dried at<br>
approximately 60°C for a minimum of 30 minutes (range 23-32 minutes).<br>
Operating parameters are shown in, Table 7.<br>
A Sweco Sifter (or equivalent equipment) was fitted at the top with a 16<br>
mesh screen and at the bottom with a 20 mesh screen. The entire batch of coated<br>
beads was sieved and coated beads outside the 16-20 mesh range discarded.<br>
Example 3<br>
Encapsulation of Coated Beads<br>
An encapsulation machine (H&amp;K Encapsulator or equivalent) was prepared<br>
with a bead filter attechment and the coated beads from Example 2 encapsulated.<br>
Target fit weights were determined by assay of the coaled beads prior to<br>
encapsulation. Variability of the fill weight was controlled by weight sorting, which<br>
is required for the 15 mg strength, but optional and employed asnecessary for the<br>
25 and 50 mg strengths A KKE sortng machine (or equivalent was used to<br>
weigh the filled capsules when weight sorting was employed. Filled capsules not<br>
meeting the acceptable weight range were discarded by the sorter.<br>
