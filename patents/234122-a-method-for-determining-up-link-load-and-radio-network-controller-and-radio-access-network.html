UPLINE LOAD DETERMINATION AND SIGNALING FOR ADMISSION AND CONGESTION CONTROL<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
The present invention relates to cellular radio communications and finds particularly advantageous application to third generation, wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) cellular radio communications systems.<br>
In cellular radio communication, admission and congestion control for each cell are used to maintain acceptable quality of service for existing mobile user connections in those cells. Admitting too many new connections may result in increased interference between the mobile user connections degrading the quality of service. In such a situation, congestion control mechanisms in the radio access network may discontinue service or reduce the quality of service of some connections. The goal therefore is to admit a new mobile user connection only if there are available resources sufficient to satisfy its service requirements.<br>
One admission control strategy is to set a limit on the number of mobile user connections and to admit a new user only if the total number of users is below that limit, sometimes referred to as "hard capacity/' An alternative is to base admission control on measurements or estimates relating to the actual load of the system, sometimes referred to as "soft capacity." Soft capacity procediares may be based on interference measurements. In die uplink direction from mobile to base station, the interference includes both background noise as well as total received power from the transmitting mobiles. The more mobile users transmitting, die more interference, and die higher the uplink load is in that base station's cell.<br>
Interference at die base station is caused both by transmitting mobiles located in that base station cell as well as transmitting mobiles located in. other cells, particularly nearby cells. Thus, admission control would be more accurate if it could be based on both intra-cell uplink interference and inter-ceil<br><br>
uplink interference. A difficulty here is that neither the intra-cell uplink interference nor the inter-cell uplink interference can be directly measured with reasonable complexity and sufficient accuracy.<br>
Path gain measurements made (direcdy or indirecdy) by the mobiles can be used to estimate intra-cell uplink interference and inter-cell uplink interference. Mobile's are normally ordered by the network to often send some type of measurement report to the radio network that includes path gain values (or values from which path gain can be calculated) relating to pilot signals received from nearby base stations. From these path gain measurements, the interference level in a cell can be estimated that takes into account intra-cell uplink interference and inter-cell uplink interference.<br>
An obstacle to using mobile user measurement reports relates to the practice of mobiles only sending such reports to their respective "serving" radio network controller (SRNC). The serving RNC is the RNC that establishes the mobile user connection. In other words, the mobile radio is in a cell controlled by that RNC when the connection is initiated and established. If the mobile user moves to another cell "X" controlled by another RNC, referred to as a drift RNC (DRNC), the mobile's measurement report is nevertheless still directed to the SRNC.<br>
Because the drift RNC lacks the benefit of the information contained in this drifting mobile's measurement report, it cannot formulate a comprehensive determination of the intra-cell and inter-cell uplink interference caused by the uplink transmissions of such drifting mobiles. Without the measurement reports, the drift RNC does not know what impact mobile transmissions from drifting mobiles will have on the uplink load in cell X. A similar problem exists for a mobile that may not have drifted to another RNC's cell, but is still close enough to generate measurement reports relating to one of the other RNC's cells, e.g., cell "Y". Those measurement reports are sent to the serving RNC but not to the other<br><br>
(cell Y's) RNC The other RNC therefore does not know what impact that mobile's uplink transmission has on cell Y's total uplink interference load.<br>
One way to solve this problem is for all RNCs to receive all mobile measurement reports. But this would create an enormous and largely unnecessary signaling load. A more efficient approach is for the serving RNC to signal the load contribution of all mobiles for which it is the serving RNC to all cells controlled by another RNC that are affected by the uplink transmissions of those mobiles. This allows the other RNC to determine the contribution of those mobiles to the total uplink interference in its cells. The other RNC can then perform admission or congestion control in one or more of its affected cells using the determined uplink load contribution information.<br>
The serving RNC may receive measurement reports from one or more of the mobile radios periodically, upon the occurrence of an event, or in response to a request from the serving RNC. The measurement reports may include path gain information. The path gain information may be path gain values or values from which path gain values may be determined. Other uplink load measurement parameters may be employed in the uplink load estimation, e.g., mobile UE activity level, target signal quality such as target carrier-to-interference ratio, etc.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular example embodiments, hardware, techniques, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. For example, the embodiments described below are set in the non-limiting context of a third generation, WCDMA based cellular radio communications system. However, the invention is applicable to other types of cellular radio communications systems.<br>
In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known methods, interfaces, devices, and signaling techniques are omitted so as not to obscure the description with unnecessary detail. Moreover, individual function blocks are shown in some of the figures. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions may be implemented using individual hardware circuits, using software functioning in conjunction with a suitably programmed digital microprocessor or general purpose computer, using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a third generation, WCDMA-based cellular radio communication system 10. The User Equipment (UE) 22 is the mobile radio terminal by which a user/subscriber can access services offered by the operator's Core Network(s) 12. The UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 14 is responsible for the establishment and control of radio connections with the mobile UEs. The Radio Network Subsystem (RNS) 16 controls a number of Base Stations (BSs) 20 in the UTRAN 14. Each base station 20 coordinates radio communications in one or more cells. A cell covers a geographical area and is identified by a unique identity broadcast in the cell by its base station. There may be more than one cell covering the same geographical area.<br>
In Fig. 1, each base station 20 includes three cells. Base station BS2's cells are labeled 1.1,1.2, and 1.3, and base station BS3's cells are labeled 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 for use in a subsequent example. Each Radio Network Controller (RNC) 18 controls radio resources and radio connectivity within a set of cells. A radio link, such as that shown in Fig. 2, represents the communication between a mobile UE and one cell in the UTRAN 14, which in Fig. 2 is the third cell associated with base station BS1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows interfaces connecting the different nodes in the UTRAN 14. The Iu interface is defined between the core network 12 and the UTRAN 14. The lur interface is defined for communications between RNCs 18. The Iub interface is defined for communications between the RNC 18 and its base stations 20. User data is transported on transport bearers over these interfaces. Depending on the transport network used, these transport bearers may be mapped to AAL2 connections (in case of an ATM-based transport network) or UDP connections (in case of an IP-based transport network).<br>
For a UTRAN - UE connection, an RNC can have the following roles: SRNC (Serving RNC) controlling the mobile UE within the UTRAN and DRNC (Drift RNC) supporting the SRNC with radio resources for a mobile UE connection that has moved to a cell controlled by the DRNC. The UTRAN 14<br><br>
decides the role of an RNC (SRNC or DRNC) when the UE-RAN connection is being established. Normally, the RNC that controls the cell, where the connection to the UE is initially established, is assigned the SRNC role for this UE connection. As the UE moves, the connection is maintained by establishing radio communication via new cells, possibly also involving cells controlled by other RNCs. Fig. 3 shows a mobile UE connection established by an SRNC (RNC1) and subsequently supported by a DRNC (RNC2). For the purpose of illustrating the RNC roles, only the SRNC is shown with an interface to the core network (even though all RNCs have a core network lu interface).<br>
The uplink load situation at a specific base station can be characterized by the total received wideband power I relative to the power of the background noise N.   This ratio is defined as the uplink noise rise I/N. Unfortunately, the uplink noise rise is difficult to directly measure in practice. An alternative is to estimate the noise rise using readily available measurements reported by mobile UEs' actively engaged in a UTRAN-UE connection.<br>
For example, path gain measurements (or measurements from which path gain can be calculated) are regularly made by the UE. Specifically, the UE may measure the received signal strength of a base station pilot signal. The system information transmitted on the broadcast channel includes as part of its message the power level at which the pilot signal was transmitted from the base station. The downlink path gain is calculated in the UE by dividing the received signal strength by the base station transmitted power. Assuming that the path gain in the downlink (base station to UE) is approximately the same in the uplink (UE to base station), the uplink path gain can be determined using the received signal strength measured by the mobile UE. The mobile UEs could alternatively simply report received signal strength from which the SRNC could calculate the path gain by knowing the power level at which the pilot signals were transmitted.  For purposes of simplifying the description only, it is here assumed that the mobile UE divides the received signal strength by the base station transmit power and reports the path gain.<br><br>
A mathematical explanation is now provided to show how the mobile measured padi gain can be used to estimate uplink load in a cell. Most physical quantities can be expressed using either logarithmic (e.g., dB or dBm) or linear scale. To avoid confusion, linearly scaled values are indicated with a bar. Thus, g, is a path gain value in linear scale and- the corresponding path gain<br>
value in logarithmic scale.<br>
Consider an uplink situation in a cellular radio system with B cells. Assume that M active mobile stations are transmitting using the powers p,(i) = 1,...,M . The signal power from mobile station /and received in<br>
cell j(j = 1,	J5) is attenuated by the power or path gain gfj (/)(
propagation situation in a cellular network can thus be described by the path gains, which together form an uplink gain matrix<br><br>
This matrix is most likely not square because there are more mobile stations than cells in a cellular radio system. If the mobile station / is connected to cell  this cell<br><br><br><br>
reasonable simplification to assume that β1(t) » yf(t). In a simplistic situation, the quality' of a specific service, for example in terms of data rate or bit error rate, can be related to a required target CTIR, denoted /?/ (or a target CIR denoted yj).<br>
This target is reconsidered regularly by outer power control loops. The outer power control loop update rate is typically orders of magnitude faster than the admission control, and the changes are relatively small. Therefore, the target CTIR is considered constant.<br>
An admitted mobile station is allocated a connection to a base station (typically, the one with most favorable propagation conditions, i.e., highest g), a<br>
waveform (in WCDMA, a code), and a transmission power p,(/). The aim is to<br>
update the power so that CIR is equal to target CIR. Because power control is much faster than admission control, perfect power control is assumed so that the actual CIR equals the target<br>
WCDMA allows a mobile station to be connected to multiple cells associated with different base stations (soft handover) or to multiple cells associated with the same base station (softer handover). Denote the set of connected cells supporting a connection of mobile station i by k. In softer handover, the received signals can be optimally combined. Using maximum ratio combining, the CTIR is given by <br>
Conversely, when connected to different base station cell as in soft handover, selection combining is used and the signal with the best quality measure is chosen.<br><br>
The following derives a practical estimate of the relative uplink load where the time index  t is suppressed to simplify the derivation. The maximal uplink load of cell in a sparsely planned second generation TDMA/FDMA system is solely determined by the number of frequency channels (times the number of time slots) at that cell. In densely planned systems such as a WCDMA system or a GSM system, the maximal uplink load is determined by the propagation situation between mobile and base stations. A number of approximations are adopted to obtain a relative load estimate based on available mobile measurements. Assume that the CTIR expression for softer handover in equation (3) is approximately true also for soft handover. The assumption is not that maximum ratio combining is used, but rather that it constitutes an approximate expression, which is more true when the mobile's active set is dominated by one connection. This yields<br><br><br><br>
The mobile UE reports its path gain measurements to its serving RNC via radio resource control (RRC) measurement reports. This measurement scheme works well within the context of a single RNC With several RNCs in the UTRAN, however, this scheme has limitations. Consider a situation as illustrated by Table 1 in which six UEs with active connections established with RNC1 as the serving RNC provide measurement reports to RNC1. Mobile UEs served by other RNCs are not included.<br><br><br>
All mobile UEs 1.1-1.6 are contributing ("c") to the uplink load at all base station cells, but measurements are not available relative to all base station cells. Measurements ("m") are made for base station cells where the load contribution is significant, i.e., to cells with high path gain. All measurements "m" are touted back to the SRNC corresponding to RNC1. RNC2 is unaware of those measurement reports. One or more cells are included in a mobile UE's active set "as." An active set cell has an active connection with the mobile UE. In diversity handover (soft or softer handover), the mobile UE will have two or more cells in its active set. Mobile UE 1.4 is an example of a diversity handover connection with both cell 1.3 and cell 2.1 being in its active set.<br>
Mobile UEs 1.1 and 1.2 do not provide measurements relative to any base station cells controlled by RNC 2, and therefore, the load contribution to those cells cannot be estimated using mobile path gain measurements. Mobile UEs 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 include cell 2.1 in their respective active sets. RNC 2 is thus aware of the existence of these diree UE's in cell 2.1. Since these three UE connections go through RNC 2 to the serving RNC 1, and since they are power controlled by a base station that is controlled by RNC 2, RNC 2 can estimate their uplink load contribution in cell 2.1. However, mobile UEs 1.3,1.4, and 1.6 also provide measurements "m" indicating the load contribution to other cells controlled by RNC 2. This information initially resides only in the serving RNC1.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates radio link measurement information sent from various mobile UEs in Table 1 to the network. A mobile UE makes padi gain measurements (shown as dashed lines) for certain cells that are not in its active set. Those measurements are reported to the network over an active radio link shown as a solid line.  For Instance, UE 1.3 sends its measurement report to RNC1 via its active set radio link with cell 1.2. That report includes path gain measurement information for cells 1.1, 1.3, and 2.1. Because all mobile UEs in Figure 4 have RNC 1 as their serving RNC, all of their measurement reports are routed back to RNC 1. Even the measurement reports relating to cells 2.1 and 2.2 controlled by<br><br>
RNC 2 are routed through RNC 2 back to RNC 1. It should be understood that for mobiles having an active set radio link to any cell controlled by RNC 2, the measurement report including the path gain to cells 2.1 and 2.2 only passes through the RNC 2 without any extraction of the message content by RNC 2. When a mobile UE has an active set connection with a cell (shown as a solid line), the mobile UE's measurement report routed to the SRNC includes path gain values for that cell as well.<br>
In general, uplink load information stored in the serving RNC is communicated to other affected RNCs so they have a more accurate picture to the total uplink load in their affected cells. In one example embodiment, the serving RNC signals over the Iur interface the uplink load contribution from all its served UEs' to all affected cells controlled by another RNC. For the example in Table 1, RNC 1 signals this information to RNC 2,<br>
Reference is made to the flowchart in Fig. 5. The serving RNC detects (1) measurement reports from served UEs or (2) SRNC internally measured values like UE traffic activity as described more below (step SI). The SRNC sends served UE uplink load values or contributions (based on served UE measurement reports or determined by the SRNQ to one or more other RNCs having cells affected by the served UE uplink transmissions (step S2). The serving RNC may send the load values/contributions to other RNC(s) using any suitable messaging protocol at any suitable timing. Fig. 6 shows an example Uplink Load Contributions message sent from the serving RNC 1 to RNC 2. For example, the messaging format specified in the relevant 3 GPP protocol section may be employed. In terms of timing, mobile UE measurements may be sent on-demand or by request from the other RNC, periodically, when received from the mobile UEs, when some other event occurs, etc.<br>
The other RNC uses the mobile UE measurements received from the serving RNC to perform admission control and/or congestion control in each of its affected cells (step S3).  For example, the RNC may compare a total uplink load to<br><br>
a threshold value. If the threshold is exceeded, new connections may not be admitted. In addition, the RNC may take steps to actively reduce the load by reducing quality of service for one or more existing connections. This could be done for example by ordering a number of mobile UEs to decrease their transmission bitrate or by even disconnecting a number of mobile users.<br>
The measurement and reporting steps described in Fig. 5 are now applied to the specific example in Table 1. RNC 1 signals the total uplink load contributions of all the mobiles served by RNC 1 on each cell controlled by RNC 2. Specifically, RNC 1 signals the two uplink load values to RNC 2 its mobile UEs 1.1-1.6 create in cell 2.1 and in cell 2.2, respectively.<br>
Different types of load values may be calculated and conveyed depending on the desired accuracy and permissible complexity. In the example, non-limiting embodiment, the load estimate is based on the measured path relationships set forth above. The power gain from mobile /to base stationy is denoted by gjjm  Quality of service is related to the target carrier-to-total-interference ratio β I, a known value at the serving RNC. The set of cells which mobile i is connected to is denoted Ki. For mobiles in macro diversity handover, the set Ki<br>
contains cells from more than one base station. The uplink load estimate Ly at base station j  is given, as in eq. (9), by:<br><br>
This uplink load estimate can be computed using path gain measurements from the mobile UEs together with knowledge of the target (tgt) CIR βird. The uplink loads in cell 2.1 and cell 2.2 caused by active mobiles served<br>
by RNC 2 are estimated in RNC 2 because that is where the path gain measurement information regarding mobiles served by RNC 2 resides. However, path gain measurement information from mobiles served by RNC 1 (all of the UEs Listed in<br><br>
Table 1) resides in that RNC 1. The estimated uplink load of cell 2.1 may be expressed as:<br><br>
RNC 2 already knows the uplink load contributions of the mobiles served by RNC2. The second line in equation (11) describes the aggregate uplink load contribution by mobile UEs served by RNC 1 to the load of cell 2.1. The uplink load contributions of UE 1.1 and UE 1.2 are unknown because neither UE has provided path gain measurements for cell 2.1. Most probably, their contribution can be neglected. The uplink load contributions from UE 1.3 and UE 1.4 to cell 2.1 depend on the path loss to cell 1.2, cell 1.3, and cell 2.1 for these two mobile UEs. For UE 1.3, the path gain to the cell of interest, ceil 2.1, is divided by the path gain to the cell that power-controls UE 1.3 cell 1.2. For UE 1.44, the path gain to the cell of interest, cell 2.1, is divided by the sum of the path gains of the two cells that power-control UE 1,3, cell 1.3 and cell 2.1. Because UE 1.5 and UE 1.6 include cell 2.1 in their respective active sets, the path gain ratios for UE 1.5 and UE 1.6 for cell 2.1 are one and their contribution depends only on their respective target signal-to-interference ratios β1, which is actually known in RNC 2.<br><br><br>
In general, the uplink load contribution from all served mobile UEs to all affected cells controlled by a different RNC is provided from the serving RNC to the other RNC. Although the above example uses path gain measurements as uplink load values, other load values may be employed.  For example, the load value may be based on uplink traffic activity of the users that contribute to the uplink load in cells controlled by another RNC. The uplink load depends on how much each mobile UE actually uses its assigned channel. For speech, the activity factor is fairly stable. Around 30-50% of the time a speech user actually talks (uses) the channel. But for data services, the activity may vary considerably for different users and even over time for the same user.   For instance, some data users may transmit large data files in the uplink direction, which creates a large UL noise rise, while others only send small requests for server-based, downlink-dominated traffic like web browsing.<br>
Like the UE path gain measurements, the mobile UE activity is most conveniently determined in and obtained from the serving RNC, although it may also be determined in a drift RNC, but with more difficulty. So mobile UE activity is another example of valuable uplink load information that resides in one RNC, but is needed in a different RNC. In this case, mobile activity information available in the serving RNC is signaled to another affected RNC to permit the other RNC to formulate a more accurate and complete picture of uplink load in its cells. Alternatively, the serving RNC could send cell load measures including both padi gain and UE activity measurements to the affected RNCs. Each term on the second row in the equation above may be multiplied with the corresponding activity factor for each UE (i.e., UEs 1.3, 1.4,1.5 and 1.6) to obtain that cell load measure.<br>
A third example of information that could be employed to improve the uplink cell load measures but may reside in the "wrong RNC" is the uplink CIR or (CTIR) value. As mentioned before, there is a so-called outer loop power control loop that regulady considers and updates the CIB. (or CTIR) target values in<br><br>
order to keep the connection quality at the required level. Typically, the quality is measured in block error rate (BLER), which is the number of erroneously received data blocks divided by the total number of received data blocks. If BLER increases above the acceptable required BLER, the outer loop power control increases the CIR target value, and if unnecessary quality is provided (generating unnecessarily high interference to other users), the outer loop power control decreases the CIR target value for that user. Since the decoding of data blocks is performed in the SRNC, the CIR target values for the mobiles served by that RNC are calculated in the SRNC.<br>
Hence, CIR target values are another example of information that resides in the one RNC but would be useful in another RNC. Specifically, continuously updated CIR target values (/?/ values) for the mobiles served by RNC 1 are not present in RNC 2. So in the example above, the correct and up-to-date  β  values for UEs 1.3,1.4,1.5, and 1.6 are only known in RNC 1. (Actually, the<br>
RNC 2 receives an initial J3! value for the mobiles for which it sets up an active set<br>

are not normally known to RNC 2). Accordingly, the β  value updates may also be<br>
uplink load values signaled between SRNC to another RNC.  Generalizing equation (11), with an arbitrary load estimate (or "load value"), the estimated total load of a ceMj, controlled by any RNC, can be expressed as:<br><br>
i.e., an aggregate of contributions from mobiles widi different serving RNCs. If one assumes diat cellyis cell 2.1, and thus is controlled by RNC 2, the example<br>
above is obtained.   £,iRNCl is then the sum of the tour terms on the second line of<br>
the equation (11), (or only the first two terms of the second line), and is signaled to RNC 2. Signaling load contribution information between RNCs allows the information receiving RNCs to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of the<br><br>
uplink load situation in their respective cells. Again, any suitable protocol and/or triggering mechanism could be used to signal the load information.<br>
The load estimates may be expressed in different formats in the signaling between RNCs. One way to express it would be in "contributing interference power" in celly, expressed in units of linear terms [W or mW] or logarithmic terms [dBW or dBm]. Another example signaling format would be in terms of "percentage of maximum acceptable uplink load/'<br>
