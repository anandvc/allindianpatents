Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
According to the above-described configuration, a sliding device having excellent seizure resistance can be provided.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0006]<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to examples shown in the accompanying drawings. In Figure 1, a sliding device 1 is provided in a housing of a swash plate compressor. The sliding device 1 is made up of a swash plate 3 attached tiltingly to a rotating shaft 2 pivotally supported in the housing and a plurality of shoes 4 sliding on the swash plate 3.<br>
The swash plate 3 is formed into a disc shape, and both end surfaces of the swash plate 3 form flat sliding surfaces 3A on which the shoes 4 slide.<br>
On the other hand, the shoe 4 is formed into a semispherical shape as a whole, and has a sliding surface 4A sliding on the sliding surface 3A of the swash plate 3 and a convex surface 4B having a semispherical shape. [0007]<br>
In the housing of the swash plate compressor, a plurality of pistons 5 are arranged so as to be in parallel with and surround the rotating shaft 2.  In an arcuate notch part 5A formed at one end of each of the pistons 5, a set of two shoes 4 is slidably held.  The notch part 5A in this state is arranged so as to wrap the outer peripheral portion of the swash plate 3 and to bring the sliding surfaces 4A of the shoes 4 of each set into contact with the sliding surfaces 3A of the swash plate 3.<br>
When the rotating shaft 2 is rotated, the swash plate 3 rotates, and the sliding surfaces 3A, which are both end surfaces of the swash plate 3, and the sliding surfaces 4A of the shoes 4 of each set slide with each other. Accordingly, each of the pistons 5 advances and retreats in the axial direction via the shoes 4 of each set.<br>
The above-described configuration is the same as that of the conventionally known sliding device.<br>
 [0008]<br>
The shoe 4 of this example is formed of SUJ2, which<br>
is a ferrous material, and the substantially flat sliding surface 4A consisting of an end plate has a slightly convex shape such that the center side thereof rises slightly (about 2 (xm) from the outer peripheral edge. Thereby, when the sliding surface 4A slides on the sliding surface 3A of the swash plate 3, lubricating oil is prone to be drawn to between the sliding surfaces 4A and 3A.<br>
- As described later, in this example, the whole region of the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 is hardened by being irradiated with laser beams and the swash plate 3 is improved, and also the seizure resistance of the sliding surfaces 3A and 4A of both the members is improved, in turn the seizure resistance of the whole of the sliding device 1 being improved. [0009]<br>
The hardening process of the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 and the subsequent fabricating processes are explained.  First, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, the whole region of the sliding surface 4A, which is the end surface of the shoe 4 (parent material) manufactured of SUJ2 into a semispherical shape, is irradiated with YAG laser in such a manner that many circles 6 having the same diameter are drawn.<br>
The diameter of each of the circles 6 is set at 0.8 ram, and each of the circle 6 is formed so that the center thereof is located at the position of the intersection at the time when longitudinal and transverse parallel lines are drawn at the same intervals P in the whole region of the sliding surface 4A.  In this example, the interval P is set at 1.1 mm.<br>
In this example, the output of the YAG laser applied to the sliding surface 4A is 50 W, a condenser lens is adjusted so that the YAG laser focuses at a position 2 mm deep from the top surface of the sliding surface 4A. Therefore, the YAG laser is applied to the top surface of the sliding surface 4A in a defocusing state. [0010]<br>
The location of each of the circles 6 on the sliding surface 4A irradiated with the laser in this manner projects expandingly in an annular form as shown in Figures 4 and 5 to form an annular expandingly projecting part 7, and a tapered concave part 8 concaved to the downside is formed adjacently on the inside in the radial direction of the annular expandingly projecting part 7. That is to say, by applying the laser to the sliding surface 4A so as to form the circle 6, a crater-shaped annular expandingly projecting part 7 is formed at the location of the 'circle 6 irradiated with the laser.  The height of the annular expandingly projecting part 7 and the depth of the concave part 8 each are approximately 1<br>
to 3 ^im.  Further, on the outside in the radial direction of the annular expandingly projecting part 7, there is formed a reticular concave part 10 that connects with each other and reaches the outer periphery of the sliding surface 4A.<br>
The annular expandingly projecting part 7 and a portion 11 on the inside in the depth direction of the annular expandingly projecting part 7 (a portion on the upside from a broken line 9) are hardened so that the hardness thereof is about Hv 100 increased from Hv 750, which is the hardness of the parent material of the shoe 4.<br>
On the other hand, a portion on the inside in the radial direction of the annular expandingly projecting part 7 and a portion on the outside of the annular expandingly projecting part 7 (portions of the concave part 8 and the reticular concave part 10) on the sliding surface 4A are annealed to form non-hardened portions. These portions have a hardness that is about Hv 100 lower than that of the parent material. [0011]<br>
In this example, by applying the laser to the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 so that a large number of the circles 6 are drawn as described above, first, a large number of the minute annular expandingly projecting parts 7 and concave parts 8 and the reticular concave part 10 are formed.<br>
Subsequently, all of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7 on the sliding surface 4A are removed once by lapping to make the sliding surface 4A smooth, and then the sliding surface 4A is buffed, by which the fabrication is finished.<br>
After the fabrication has been finished in this manner, as shown in Figure 6, annular expandingly projecting parts 7', which are the same as the aforementioned annular expandingly projecting parts 7, are formed at the locations of the circles 6 (locations of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7) irradiated with the laser over the whole region of the sliding surface 4A, and also concave parts 8', which are the same as the aforementioned concave parts 8, are formed each on the inside in the radial direction of each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7' .  Further, on the outside in the radial direction of each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7', there is formed a lubricating oil passage 10' consisting of a reticular concave part that allows lubricating oil to flow.<br>
The reason for this process is as described below. The initially formed annular expandingly projecting parts 7 are removed by lapping, and then the sliding surface 4A is buffed, by which the hardness of the portion 11 on the inside in the depth direction of the annular expandingly projecting part 7 is increased as compared with the hardness of the peripheral portion thereof.  Therefore,<br>
the portion having high hardness remains in an annular form, so that the annular expandingly projecting parts 7', the concave parts 8', and the lubricating oil passage 10' are formed. [0012]<br>
In this example, hardened portions are formed by a large number of the annular expandingly projecting parts 8' formed as described above. Also, the concave parts 8' function as storage parts for storing the lubricating oil, and also the lubricating oil passage 10' is configured so that the lubricating oil can flow therein.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the height h of each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7' (the depth of the concave part 8') is 0.05 to 0.3 (im, and the maximum width W of the cross section (dimension in the radial direction of the foot part) is about 0.3 mm. Also, the diameter Dl of peak portion of the annular expandingly projecting part 7' is 0.8 mm.  The diameter D2 of outer peripheral edge of the annular expandingly projecting part 7' is about 1.1 mm, and the diameter D3 of inner peripheral edge of the annular expandingly projecting part 7' is about 0.5 mm.<br>
As described above, in this example, the shoe 4 using SUJ2, which is a ferrous material, as a parent material (basic 'material) is subjected to the above-described laser hardening of the sliding surface 4A and the subsequent lapping and buffing operations.<br>
In this example, contrary to the shoe 4 configured as described above, the swash plate 3 is configured as described below in terms of the basic material and surface treatment thereof.  The swash plate 3 uses high-strength brass as a basic material, and the surfaces of the swash plate 3, which are the sliding surfaces 3A, are not subjected to special surface treatment such as plating. [0013]<br>
Figure 7 shows the result of a seizure resistance test, the test being conducted on the above-described sliding device 1 of this example and a sliding device using shoes of conventional art.<br>
In Figure 7, for the shoe of conventional art, the sliding surface is not hardened by the laser, and therefore the sliding surface is flat.  As a swash plate used as the mating member of the shoe of conventional art, the swash plate formed of brass material that was the same as in this example was used.<br>
The conditions of the seizure resistance test are as follows: (Test conditions)<br>
Number of revolutions of swash plate: increased by 1000 rpm per 1 minute at nine steps: maximum number of revolutions 90001 rpm (circumferential speed 38 m/s)<br>
Surface pressure: preload 2.7 MPa, increased by 2.7 MPa per 1 minute: until seizure occurs<br>
Oil mist quantity: 0.05 to 0.25 g/min, nozzle position fixed<br>
Oil: refrigerator oil<br>
Seizing condition: shaft torque higher than 4.0 N-m<br>
The number of revolutions of the swash plate 3 was increased under the above-described condition in the state in which the sliding surface of the shoe 4 was brought into contact under pressure with the swash plate 3.  On the other hand, the surface pressure at the time when the shoe 4 was brought into contact under pressure with the swash plate 3 was increased under the above-described condition.  When the shaft torque applied to the swash plate 3 exceeded 4.0 N-m, it was judged that seizure occurred.  The same holds true for the conventional sliding device. [0014]<br>
As can be understood from the test result shown in Figure 7, the seizure load of the shoe and sliding device of conventional art was not higher than 5 MPa, whereas that of the shoe and sliding device of this example was not lower than 22 MPa.  The shoe 4 of this example clearly has excellent seizure resistance as compared with the conventional shoe.<br>
As described above, according to this example, the shoe 4 and the sliding device 1 having excellent seizure resistance can be provided.<br>
Also, the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 of this example is formed with a large number of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7', and also the concave part 8' for storing lubricating oil is formed on the inside in the radial direction of each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7' so that the lubricating oil is stored in the concave part 8'.  Moreover, at the position on the outside adjacent to the annular expandingly projecting part 7', the lubricating oil passage 10' consisting of the reticular concave part is formed.  Therefore, the load capacity of the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 can be increased, and in turn the shoe 4 and the sliding device 1 having excellent wear resistance can be provided. [0015]<br>
In the above-described example, the sliding surface 4A of the shoe 4 using SUJ2 as a basic material is subjected to the above-described laser hardening and the subsequent fabrications.  However, the combination of the basic material used for the shoe 4 and the surface treatment of the sliding surface 4A thereof as shown in Figure 8 can be adopted.<br>
In Figure 8, SI indicates the shoe 4 of the above-described example.  In the above-described example, the sliding surface 
laser is applied to the sliding surface 4A to harden it, the whole region of the surface of the sliding surface 4A may be hardened, or in place of the hardening, the whole region of the surface of the sliding surface 4A may be subjected to the following surface treatment: (1) Ni-P base hard plating or (2) diffusion treatment such as nitriding, carbonization hardening, and carbonization nitriding may be performed.  Further, other types of surface treatment, (3) plating of any of tin, tin alloy, solder alloy, and silver may be adopted, or (4) plating of either of manganese phosphate and zinc phosphate may be adopted. [0016]<br>
In the case where the sliding surface 4A of the basic material shown in this example is subjected to surface treatment of the above item (1) or (2), after the surface treatment of item (I) or (2) has been performed on the sliding surface 4A of the basic material, the aforementioned laser hardening is performed.  In this case, the surface of the sliding surface 4A is hardened by the surface treatment of item (1) or (2).<br>
Also, in case where the sliding surface 4A of the basic material shown in this example is subjected to surface treatment of the above item (3) or (4), before the surface treatment of item (3) or (4) is performed on the sliding surface 4A, the aforementioned laser hardening, lapping, and buffing are performed, and<br>
thereafter the surface treatment of item (3) or (4) is<br>
performed on the sliding surface 4A.<br>
[0017]<br>
S2 in Figure 8 indicates a second example of the shoe 4.  The shoe 4 of the second example uses an aluminum-silicon alloy as a basic material, and the surface of the sliding surface 4A is subjected to Ni-P base hard plating.  In this case, after the surface treatment has been performed on the sliding surface 4A of the basic material, the laser hardening, lapping, and buffing are performed as described above.<br>
Also, S3 indicates a third example of the shoe 4. The shoe 4 of the third example uses a copper alloy as a basic material, and the surface of the sliding surface 4A is subjected to Ni-P base hard plating.  In this case, after the surface treatment has been performed on the surface of the basic material, the aforementioned laser hardening, lapping, and buffing are performed.<br>
Further, S4 indicates a fourth example of the shoe 4. The shoe 4 of the fourth example uses pure titanium or a titanium alloy as a basic material, and surface treatment is not specially performed.  However, the surface of the sliding surface 4A may be subjected to any diffusion treatment (surface treatment) such as nitriding, carbonization hardening, and carbonization nitriding.  In this case, after the surface treatment has been performed<br>
on the surface of the basic material, the aforementioned laser hardening, lapping, and buffing are performed. [0018]<br>
In the above-described example, the swash plate 3 uses high-strength brass as a basic material, and surface treatment is not specially performed on the sliding surfaces 3A thereof.  However, the combination of the basic material used for the swash plate 3 and the surface treatment of the sliding surfaces 3A thereof as shown in Figure 9 can be adopted.<br>
In Figure 9, SW1 indicates the swash plate 3 of the above-described example, which uses high-strength brass as a basic material.  In the swash plate 3 using high-strength brass as a basic material, any of the following surface treatments of the sliding surfaces 3A may be adopted: (1) coating of a thermosetting resin and a solid lubricant on the surface thereof, (2) coating or impregnation of a solid lubricant (MoS2, PTFE, graphite), and (3) plating of any of tin, tin alloy, solder alloy, and silver. [0019]<br>
Also, as a second example of the swash plate 3, as indicated by SW2 in Figure 9, a ferrous material is used as a basic material, and the surface thereof is coated with a copper alloy by thermal spray or the like, and the surface treatment of any of the above items (1) to (3) is performed.<br>
Further, as a third example of the swash plate 3, as indicated by SW3 in Figure 9, an aluminum-silicon alloy is used as a basic material, and the surface treatment of any of the items (1) to (3) and (4): Ni-P base or Ni-P-B base plating may be performed.<br>
Also, as a fourth example of the swash plate 3, as indicated by SW4 in Figure 9, the surface of the ferrous basic material is coated with an aluminum-silicon alloy by thermal spray or the like, and the surface treatment of any of the above items (1) to (4) is performed.<br>
Further, as a fifth example of the swash plate 3, as indicated by SW5 in Figure 9, a ferrous basic material is used, and any of the surface treatment of any of the items (1) to (4) and (5): carbon base hard coating (DLC, WC/C, CrN) is performed.  In the fifth example, after the ferrous basic material has been hardened, the surface treatment of any of the aforementioned items (1) to (5) may be performed. [0020]<br>
As described above, the shoe 4 is broadly divided into four examples as shown in Figure 8, and on the other hand, the swash plate 3 is broadly divided into five examples as shown in Figure 9.<br>
Therefore, by combining the shoes 4 shown in Figure 8 with the swash plates 3 shown in Figure 9, various types of the sliding devices 1 can be provided.  However,<br>
it is important to avoid sliding between the same kinds<br>
of materials.<br>
[0021]<br>
For the shoe 4 of the above-described examples, each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 1' is formed at the position of the intersection of longitudinal and transverse parallel lines.  However, as shown in Figure 10, each of the annular expandingly projecting parts 7' may be formed at the position of a zigzag arrangement.<br>
