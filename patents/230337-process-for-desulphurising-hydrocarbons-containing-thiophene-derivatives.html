				<td>PROCESS FOR DESULPHURISING HYDROCARBONS<br>
CONTAINING THIOPHENIC DERIVATIVES<br>
(Amended Page 1)<br>
The present indention concerns a process for<br>
desulphurisation of hydrocarbons, in particular the<br>
desulphurisation of hydrocarbon based gas oil fuel, kerosenes<br>
and petrols. It deals especially with the desulphurisation of<br>
hydrocarbon based motor fuels containing dibenzothiophenic<br>
compounds.<br>
The presence of sulphur in these fuels is considered a<br>
major environmental problem today. Actually, during<br>
combustion, sulphur is converted into various oxides of<br>
sulphur, which transform into acids, thus contributing to acid<br>
rain formation.<br>
The refineries generally use catalytic HDS processes to<br>
reduce the sulphur content of fuels.<br>
Thus the gas oils derived directly from distillation<br>
are hydrotreated between 300 and 400°c, under a hydrogen<br>
pressure ranging betweer 30 and 100 bars (30 to 100.105Pa) in<br>
the presence of a catalyst placed on a fixed bed and<br>
consisting of metal sulphides of groups VIb and VIII, fox-<br>
example cobalt molybdenum sulphides or nickel molybdenum<br>
sulphides, deposited or alumina. In view of the operating<br>
conditions and the hydrogen consumption, these processes may<br>
prove to be costly both in terms of investment and operation,<br>
especially if the fuel to be produced should have very low<br>
sulphur content. Thus for desulphurisation, a fuel containing<br>
initially 1 % by weight of sulphur, for reducing sulphur<br>
content to 0.05-0.005 % oy weight, the size of the reactor may<br>
have to be increased 4 times and the quantity of hydrogen<br>
necessary for reaction may have to be increased around 20<br>
times. It is specially difficult to eliminate sulphur traces<br>
by means of such processes, more so if sulphur belongs to the<br>
sterically hindered alkylated dibenzothiophene molecules in<br>
position 4, or 4 and 6.'<br>
In certain countries like Sweden and U.S.A,<br>
particularly in California, and other countries, the total<br>
sulphur content of gas oils is already limited to 0.005 % by<br>
weight. This limitation could be ....<br><br>
applicable within a certain time frame in the OEDC countries.<br>
For Europe, this objective of 0.005 % by weight of total<br>
sulphur content should be achieved by 2005.<br><br>
In contrast to gas oils, petrol is not derived not only by the<br>
direct distillation of crude oil, in which the sulphur content<br>
is low, but also from several processes such as reforming of<br>
naphtha, isomerising of light naphtha, alkylation of butane or<br>
propane to isooctane, methoxylation of isobutene and the<br>
catalytic cracking of distillates under vacuum or in residual<br>
atmosphere. In particular, the catalytic cracking produces<br>
about 20 to 60 % by weight cf final petrol. Besides, these<br>
contain up to 0.1 % by weight of sulphur. It is, therefore,<br>
customary to desulphurise petrol derived from catalytic<br>
cracking by processes similar to those described for hydro-<br>
desulphurisation of gas oils, for which the operating<br>
conditions are more severe with respect to hydrogen pressure,<br>
space velocity and temperature. Even though these processes<br>
are costly, sulphur content between 0.005-0.03 % by weight<br>
cannot be obtained from cracked petrol by such a traditional<br>
method. For the purpose of reducing the sulphur content,<br>
refiners thought of adding additives, particularly mercaptans<br>
and sulphides to the cracking catalyst, to decompose the<br>
sulphur compounds which are formed during the process; such<br>
additives, however, have little or no effect on<br>
benzothiophenic derivatives, even if the mercaptans and<br>
sulphides have been eliminated before cracking.<br>
In the case of petrol from catalytic cracking which<br>
produces sulphur in the petrol, hydrodesulphurisation is not<br>
only ineffective on thiophenic compounds, but also destructive<br>
with respect of the octane number of petrol. In fact, during<br>
the hydrodesulphurisation reaction, there occurs a partial<br>
hydrogenation of olefins contained in this cracked petrol,<br>
their elimination causes the octane number of petrol to drop,<br>
thereby resulting in Deterioration of petrol quality. To<br>
compensate for this loss, it is possible to introduce other<br>
constituents to improve this number or reprocess the petrol<br>
itself so as to increase this number. Including additives or<br>
reprocessing so as to improve the petrol quality will increase<br>
the cost price, it is, therefore, advantageous to have a<br>
process which will help eliminate compounds like<br>
benzothiophenic derivatives directly, while reducing the use<br>
of hydrogen.<br>
Processes for selective oxidation of sulphur compounds<br>
are among the treating processes intended for this purpose.<br>
Among the methods and processes developed for reducing the<br>
quantity of sulphur present in the fuels in the form of<br>
thiophenic derivatives, oxidation by organic peroxides,<br><br>
organic hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxides and organic<br>
peracids, was envisaged either without catalyst or by<br>
homogeneous catalysing in the presence of catalysts having a<br>
base of organometallic or metallic oxide compounds in aqueous<br>
phase (see US 3 668 117, US 3 565 793, EP 0565 324 and the<br>
publications of T.A KOCH, K.R KRAUSE, L.EMANZER,H. MEHDIZADEH,<br>
J.M ODOM, S.K SENGUPTA, New J. Chem. , 1996, 20, 163-173, and<br>
F.M COLLINS, A.R LUCY, C.SHARP, C.SHARP, J. of Molecular<br>
Catalysis: Chemical 117 (1997) 397-403.<br>
In case of processes deploying metallic catalysts with<br>
molybdenum and tungsten bases in the presence of hydrogen<br>
peroxide in aqueous solution (heterogeneous catalysis), we<br>
have to operate at temperatures greater than 60°c and there is<br>
an excessive consumption of hydrogen peroxide, a portion of<br>
this oxidant being decomposed by the catalyst used. The<br>
peracids used, being very powerful oxidants obtained by<br>
reaction of hydrogen peroxide with a carboxylic acid such as<br>
formic acid or acetic acid, are generally less efficient than<br>
hydrogen peroxide and less selective towards sulphur compounds<br>
and might oxidise olefins in particular.<br>
Other oxydesulphurisation processes in the organic medium<br>
have been proposed. These consist in bringing into contact<br>
metallic oxides or metallic compounds containing peroxo groups<br>
in aqueous or organic solutions, with hydrocarbons containing<br>
these sterically hindered sulphur compounds, in the presence<br>
or absence of organic or aqueous peroxides, these being<br>
introduced with a solvent of alcohol type or in water (see US<br>
3 816 301, US 4 956 578, US 5 958 224).<br>
Another process, described in the US patent 3 945 914,<br>
consists in producing a desulphurised hydrocarbon material in<br>
three stages of treatment. The first step consists of<br>
oxidising, at least partially, the sulphur compounds by<br>
establishing contact with peroxides, in the presence of<br>
metallic catalysts containing the metals of the group<br>
comprising titanium, zirconium, molybdenum, tungsten,<br>
vanadium, tantalum, chromium and their mixtures, in liquid or<br>
solid form, supported if necessary, the supports not being<br>
essential for reaction. The second stage consists of bringing<br>
in contact the hydrocarbon material containing these oxide<br>
compounds with another metallic compound, metallic oxide or<br>
peroxide (metals belonging to the group comprising nickel,<br>
molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, iron, zinc, vanadium, copper,<br>
manganese, mercury and their mixtures), at a temperature<br>
ranging from 250° to 730°C, under hydrogen pressure. The third<br><br>
stage consists of recovering the desulphurised hydrocarbon<br>
containing material.<br>
In all these methods and processes, the derivatives of<br>
thiophene are transformed to their sulphonated and/or<br>
sulphonic form. However, for some of these compounds, even at<br>
high temperature, the reaction is relatively slow and it takes<br>
at least one hour to achieve total conversion; else very high<br>
concentration of an oxidant is required, often in quantities<br>
much greater than the quantities necessary for the oxidation<br>
of sulphur derivatives. In other cases, it is possible to work<br>
in multiple stages, but they are expensive in terms of time<br>
and programmed monitoring.<br>
The present invention therefore seeks to propose a<br>
process of desulphurisation of hydrocarbons, particularly<br>
those used as fuel bases containing thiophenic derivatives,<br>
without reducing the octane number or the cetane number,<br>
sometimes even increasing these numbers. This deals<br>
particularly with the finishing treatment of hydrotreated gas<br>
oils, kerosene and catalytic cracked petrol, with high<br>
concentration of sterically hindered thiophenic derivatives,<br>
by hydrogenation.<br>
This invention also proposes such a process that helps<br>
achieve equal or even higher levels of oxidation than that<br>
through known processes, while reducing the reaction time and<br>
the separation of sulphur oxide compounds from desulphurised<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is, therefore, to<br>
have a selective desulphurisation process of thiophenic<br>
compounds contained in the hydrocarbons derived from the<br>
distillation of crude oil, refined or otherwise, to oxidise<br>
the thiophenic sulphur atoms into sulphones in the presence of<br>
an oxidant and a catalyst, and to separate the sulphonated<br>
compounds obtained from the said hydrocarbons; this process is<br>
characterised by the fact that it consists of at least one<br>
first stage of oxidation/adsorption by heterogeneous catalysis<br>
of sulphur compounds, in organic medium, at a temperature of<br>
at least 40°C, in the presence of an organic oxidant from the<br>
family of peroxides and peracids and in presence of a catalyst<br>
of specific surface area greater than 100 m2/g and of porosity<br>
ranging from 0.2 to 4 ml/g, and a second stage of regeneration<br>
always after the stage of oxidation/adsorption.<br><br>
For the purposes of this invention, thiophenic<br>
derivatives implies, benzothiophenic compounds, poly<br>
benzothiophenic compounds and their alkyl derivatives, among<br>
which alkyldibenzothiopnenes, especially ones which are<br>
sterically hindered by conversion processes usually used by<br>
the refiners.<br>
The process covered by this invention has the advantage<br>
of not only ensuring, at atmospheric pressure, oxidation of<br>
the entire sulphur contained in the hydrocarbons and more<br>
selectively a conversion of thiophenic derivatives into<br>
sulphones, by means of a simple industrial process, but also<br>
of adsorbing simultaneously these sulphoxides on the catalyst.<br>
In fact the separation of hydrocarbons from the major part of<br>
the sulphones and formed sulphoxides is immediate; the latter<br>
get deposited in solid form on the catalyst or in the form of<br>
deposits which can be filtered by any known means, in the<br>
treated hydrocarbons. This catalyst, on which these<br>
sulphoxides have been absorbed, constitutes the 'used<br>
catalyst'. In the event of the sulphones being dissolved in<br>
the treated hydrocarbons, they can be extracted. However, this<br>
oxidation/adsorption has no effect on the olefins, so it does<br>
not modify, in the catalytic cracked petrol, the octane number<br>
or the proportion of non-sulphurised aromatic compounds.<br>
Besides, the oxidation process of this invention improves the<br>
cetane number of gas oils.<br>
Without any theoretical limitations, it is apparent that<br>
greater the specific surface area of the catalyst, the longer<br>
is it active. Furthermore, compounds of sulphone and<br>
sulphoxide type have a strongly polar character, so they are<br>
maintained on the catalyst surface, probably at the level of<br>
Lewis acids sites of the catalyst. Similarly, larger the size<br>
of the pores, lesser is the risk of the pores of the catalyst<br>
getting blocked rapidly, and, longer the guaranteed life of<br>
the catalyst during the oxidation cycle. For the present<br>
invention, it is a quest ion of selecting the catalyst which<br>
offers the best compromise between specific surface area and<br>
pore size so as to obtain an activity that is sufficient and<br>
lasts as long as possible to have the most effective<br>
oxidation/adsorption.<br>
When the process is put to continued operation in an<br>
intermittent manner, the stages of oxidation/ adsorption and<br>
regeneration may be carried out in the same reactor or<br>
simultaneously in reactors positioned parallel and functioning<br>
alternatively with one or other of the stages in a fixed bed,<br><br>
or at least two reactors with mobile beds connected to each<br>
other by the catalytic bed, one of them being dedicated to<br>
oxidation/adsorption, the other to regeneration.<br>
In fixed bed, the first reactor containing a fixed bed of<br>
catalyst receives the hydrocarbon and oxidant fluxes, and the<br>
second receives, for regeneration of the catalyst, liquid<br>
effluents, for example a washing solvent or oxidising gaseous<br>
effluents, such as air or a mixture of air/N2, the temperature<br>
of the catalytic bed being recorded. These reactors exchange<br>
their functions when the efficiency of catalyst in the<br>
oxidation/adsorption reactor is no longer sufficient for<br>
oxidation and/or adsorption.<br>
In the mobile bed, ;he hydrocarbons are fed in the first<br>
reactor where oxidatior takes place, the catalyst being<br>
progressively pushed towards the second reactor, where it is<br>
regenerated before being sent back to the oxidation/adsorption<br>
reactor. Mobile bed reactors, which are well known in the<br>
reforming field, may be used in this device. A third reactor<br>
is used in this operating mode, which is placed between the<br>
first two reactors and helps eliminate the used hydrocarbons<br>
from the catalyst before washing the same, or to carry out the<br>
combustion of the sulphone compounds and the trapped<br>
sulphoxides.<br>
The catalysts used in this invention are selected from<br>
among the supports of the group comprising of silica, alumina,<br>
zirconia, amorphous or crystalline aluminosilicates,<br>
aluminophosphates, mesoporous silica solids and<br>
silicoaluminates, active carbons and clay, these supports<br>
being used either alone or in mixture. In the catalysts of<br>
this invention, these supports may be used advantageously as<br>
supports of the metal group comprising of titanium, zirconium,<br>
vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, iron, manganese, cerium and<br>
tungsten, these metals may be introduced in the oxide form,<br>
in the support network or deposited on the support surface.<br>
In fact, a synergic effect has been observed between the metal<br>
and the support, that means, an unanticipated increase in the<br>
catalyst activity with regard to the oxidation of thiophenic<br>
compounds and, at the same time, an increase in the trapping<br>
of sulphone and sulphoxide compounds in the pores of the<br>
catalyst, without any of them being ultimately desorbed.<br>
In the inventive process, the catalyst contains about 0<br>
to 30% by weight of metal in the form of oxide on at least one<br><br>
support. Preferably the catalyst contains 0 to 20% of metal in<br>
the form of oxide.<br>
Among the supports consisting of sterically hindered<br>
oxides, the gamma alumina, silica, mesoporous silica solids<br>
and silicoalumina , are preferred.<br>
Among the supported catalysts, those containing tungsten<br>
or titanium in the form of oxide deposited on a support or<br>
introduced in the network, this support being selected from<br>
silica, alumina and the aluminosilicates, alone or in mixture.<br>
In a preferred mode of operation of the process, the<br>
molar ratio of oxidart/total sulphur contained in the<br>
hydrocarbons is between 2 and 20, preferably between 2 and 6.<br>
As per the invention, the oxidants are selected from<br>
among the compounds of general formula R1OOR2, in which R1 and<br>
R2 are the same or different, selected from among hydrogen,<br>
linear or branched alkali groups, containing from 1 to 30<br>
atoms of carbon and the aryl or alkylaryl groups whose aryl<br>
pattern is, if necessary, substituted by alkylaryl groups, as<br>
R1 and R2 cannot simultaneously be hydrogen.<br><br>
(Amended Page 8)<br>
In a preferred mode, the oxidant of formula R1OOR2 is<br>
selected from the group comprising of tert-butyl hydroperoxide<br>
and ditert-butylperoxide.<br>
Other oxidants of this invention, the peracids of formula<br>
R3COOOH, are selected in such a manner that R3 is hydrogen or a<br>
linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1 to 30 atoms of<br>
carbon. They are selected preferably from the group comprising<br>
of peracetic acid, performic acid and perbenzoic acid.<br>
In the inventive process, the stage of regeneration of<br>
catalyst consists of removing the formed deposits by washing<br>
or by combustion.<br>
For washing, we preferably use a polar solvent, from<br>
group comprising of waiter, linear or branched alkanols<br>
containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, singly or mixed with<br>
water, alkylnitriles, comprising 1 to 6 atoms of carbon; the<br>
preferred ones are water, acetonitrile, methanol and their<br>
mixtures.<br>
By combustion, the catalyst is brought to a maximum<br>
temperature of 800°C, preferably a temperature 
a pressure ranging between 105Pa to 106Pa, preferably from<br>
105Pa to 2.105Pa, in the presence of an oxidant gas. By oxidant<br>
gas is meant, pure oxygen and all gaseous mixtures containing<br>
oxygen, particularly mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen and air<br>
itself. The quantity of oxygen in nitrogen is adjusted in such<br>
a manner as to limit the formation of water vapour, as a<br>
considerable quantity of water vapour will have a secondary<br>
effect of modifying the structure of the catalyst pores with a<br>
decrease in their volume!, particularly when it contains the<br>
crystalline aluminosilicates such as zeolites or<br>
aluminophosphates, as support. This adjustment also enables to<br>
control changes in temperature related to the exothermal<br>
property of combustion.<br>
Another objective of this invention is a device for<br>
operating the process defined above; the device consists of at<br>
least one first reactor containing an oxidation catalyst and<br>
having lines for entry o:: hydrocarbons and oxidant and a line<br>
for exit of desulphurised hydrocarbons, and if need be, a<br>
second reactor comprising inlet lines for solvent or the<br>
oxidant gas of catalyst, with a view to regenerating the same,<br>
and a line for exit of ....<br><br>
(Amended Page 9)<br>
combustion gas By oxidant' gas,, it is meant here, mixtures of<br>
oxygen/air, air/nitrogen and oxygen/nitrogen.<br>
When the device comprises of two reactors, the<br>
reactors may function ir fixed bed or mobile bed.<br>
Another objective of the invention is the application of<br>
the process defined above to the specific finishing treatment<br>
of petrol produced from catalytic cracking or even to the<br>
treatment of gas oils having been previously hydrotreated and<br>
of kerosene, for obtaining better economy with the process.<br>
This invention will be described in greater detail by<br>
means of reference to diagrams given in the annexure. These<br>
are: -<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram of a device with two reactors<br>
functioning alternatively, during oxidation and during<br>
regeneration of catalyst.<br>
Figure 2 is the diagram of a device comprising two<br>
reactors with a mobile bed, the first corresponding to the<br>
oxidation stage, and the second to the regeneration of<br>
catalyst, a line for return of regenerated catalyst being<br>
added to the system.<br>
Figures 3-1 and 3-2 represent curves illustrating the<br>
total sulphur content as a function of time, and hydrocarbons<br>
treated as per inventior in the following example III.<br>
The device in figure 1 comprises two reactors 1 and 2<br>
loaded with a catalyst placed in fixed bed. When reactor 1<br>
functions in oxidation and reactor 2 during regeneration , the<br>
line 3 brings, to the reactor 1, the charge of sulphur-<br>
containing hydrocatbons, in which the oxidant has been<br>
introduced via line 4, the three-way valve 6a and the line 8a.<br>
The desulphurised hydrocarbon flux exits reactor 1 by means of<br>
line 9a and rejoins line 10a for evacuation of desulphurised<br>
hydrocarbons via the thiee-way valve 7a.<br>
In the same way, line 5 supplies to reactor 2 either an<br>
appropriate solvent, of an oxidant gas, via th-e - three-way<br>
valve 6b and the line 8b. When the reactor operates during<br>
combustion, the temperature of the catalytic bed is maintained<br>
at 500°C. The solvent containing sulphones recovered from the<br>
catalyst or the combustion gases, SO2, CO and CO2 mainly, are<br>
evacuated via. . . .<br><br>
lines 9b, the three-way valve 7b and the line 11b in the line<br>
11a.<br>
When the regeneration of the catalyst is completed and<br>
the catalyst activity of reactor 1 becomes insufficient, the<br>
functioning of the two reactors is interchanged. Thus, the<br>
hydrocarbon/oxidant mixture uses the line 3a and the valve 6b,<br>
to enter the reactor 2 The desulphurised hydrocarbons are<br>
evacuated by the line 9a and are directed towards the blowing<br>
line 10a via the valve 7b and the line 10b.<br>
Similarly, the solvent or the oxidant gas arriving by<br>
line 5, is directed to the reactor 1 via line 3a, the valve 6a<br>
and the line 8a. The solvent or oxidant gas is brought into<br>
the drain line 11a via line 9a and the valve 7a.<br>
The valves 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b may be changed by a common<br>
process to enable circulation of the proposed fluxes.<br>
It is advantageous to place a filter, on one of the lines<br>
9a or 9b, or even 10a or 10b, for collecting the solid<br>
sulphones formed during oxidation, which remained suspended in<br>
the hydrocarbons. It is also advantageous to add traps for<br>
sulphur containing absorbents of silica or activated alumina<br>
type, on the same lines, downstream of these filters, so as to<br>
trap the sulphones still dissolved in the treated<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
The device in figure 2 comprises two reactors 20a and 20b<br>
placed in series, each containing a mobile bed of catalyst,<br>
the reactor 20a functioning in regenerative mode, and<br>
propulsion device 30 enabling return of catalyst from reactor<br>
20b to reactor 20a.<br>
The hydrocarbons are fed by the line 40 to the reactor<br>
20a, after being mixed with the oxidant via line 50. For<br>
example the reactor 20a. may be selected from among the<br>
reactors with funnels, the mobile bed of the catalyst moving<br>
by gravity towards the lower portion of the reactor. Thus<br>
while the desulphurised hydrocarbons are evacuated by the line<br>
60, the catalyst is pushed by gravity into the reactor 20b by<br>
the line 70. The solvent or combustion gas is introduced via<br>
channel 80 into the reactor 20b. In order to carry out<br>
regeneration by combustion, the temperature is increased and<br>
maintained at 500°C. The solvent charged with sulphones or<br>
combustion gas is evacuated by the line 100.<br><br>
As these mobile beds generally function in an<br>
intermittent manner, the catalyst not being continuously<br>
displaced, it is advantageous to provide a purge of solvent or<br>
nitrogen on the reactor for removal of hydrocarbons before<br>
washing, and/or for removal of combustion gas by stripping<br>
with nitrogen.<br>
At the outlet of reactor 20 b, the regenerated catalyst<br>
is taken via line 110, t) the device 30. This device may be a<br>
device for propulsion by gas under pressure or a lifting<br>
screw. It brings the regenerated catalyst back to the reactor<br>
20a, via line 120.<br>
. In certain modes of specific operation of these mobile<br>
reactors, reactors 20a and 20b may form part of the same unit<br>
with two separate stages.<br>
The following examples illustrate the effectiveness of<br>
the invention process, without being limited to these.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example seeks to describe the effectiveness of the<br>
process as per this invention, with regard to the removal of<br>
derivatives of dibenzothiophene present in the bases for<br>
partially desulphurised fuels.<br>
The samples of catalysts used are of two types, catalysts<br>
formed with a single support, and those to which one or more<br>
metals have been impregnated. The following table 1 gives<br>
the specific surface area characteristics and the porosity of<br>
each of them.<br><br><br>
The catalysts C2, C3 and C6 have been obtained by<br>
impregnation of a wet metallic salt, ammonium metatungstate<br>
and ammonium hexamolybdate, at a proportion of 140 mg per gram<br>
of support, then dried and finally calcined at a temperature<br>
of 500°C.<br>
The catalyst C4 has been obtained by treating a beta<br>
zeolite with commercial titanium as per procedure described in<br>
the patent EP 0 842 114.<br>
For testing the activity of these catalysts during<br>
oxidation and as a function of time, 20 ml of catalyst is<br>
introduced in a micropilot of 150 ml. On the catalyst is<br>
circulated a charge of middle distillates after<br>
hydrotreatment, boosted with 1800 ppm of tert-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide (tBHP) , ar. hourly space velocity (VVH) of 1h-1<br>
under atmospheric pressure, at a temperature of 70°C. Samples<br>
are taken regularly during oxidation in order to measure the<br>
catalyst activity in time. A comparative sample, called Tl,<br>
corresponding to the use of the catalyst only without<br>
peroxide, is also monitored.<br><br>
At the end of two hours of operation, these results<br>
confirm that, except for the effect due to the nature of the<br>
catalyst, the more we increase the pore size of the catalyst<br>
and the specific surface area, more the sulphur content of<br>
treated hydrocarbons reduces. It is also observed that the<br>
catalyst activity increases when it consists of a metallic<br>
oxide with support. In contrast at the end of 24 hours,<br><br>
whatever be the catalyst, we observe a slight increase in the<br>
sulphur content of desulphurised hydrocarbons, which<br>
corresponds to the beginning of blocking of the catalyst<br>
pores, the sulphones and sulphoxides attached to it.<br>
By this process it is clear that the selection of a<br>
catalyst for the inventive process is the result of a<br>
compromise between the nature of the catalyst, its specific<br>
surface area and the size of its pores.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
In this example the efficiency of the catalyst, as a<br>
function of oxidation of its constituents, is measured.<br>
We proceed as in Example 1, with catalysts C1 - C6 and<br>
study the formation of sulphones and sulphoxides with respect<br>
to the dibenzothiophene compounds, notably benzothiophene<br>
(BT), dibenzothiophene(EBT) and 4,6 dimethylbenzothiophene<br>
(DMBT), by gas chromazography equipped with a specific<br>
detector of sulphur (SIEVERS method).<br>
The results obtained are collated in the following table.<br><br>
These results show that there is at least 80 % conversion<br>
of the sterically hindered thiophenic derivatives, with<br>
catalysts constituted of a single support, and more than 90 %<br>
with catalysts constituted of supports and at least one metal<br>
in the form of metallic oxide inserted in the network of<br>
support or deposited on the support.<br><br>
Example III<br>
The purpose of this example is to show, analogous to<br>
oxidation, the effect, as a function of time, of adsorption of<br>
sulphone compounds on the oxidation/adsorption sequence and<br>
regeneration, and the efficiency of the regeneration operation<br>
with respect to oxidation/adsorption.<br>
We proceed with the catalyst C3 under the operating<br>
conditions described in Example 1 for a middle distillate<br>
containing 44 ppm of sulphur after hydrotreatment, and in the<br>
presence of 600 ppm of tEHP.<br>
The results of oxidation/adsorption are given in Figure<br>
3-1, when the catalyst is fresh. After two days, the total<br>
sulphur content in the hydrocarbons increases significantly to<br>
the initial value, in the absence of treatment as per the<br>
invention.<br>
The results of Figure 3-2 correspond to the monitoring of<br>
sulphur content of the same hydrocarbons when the same<br>
catalyst C3 regenerated by combustion, was used. The results<br>
obtained on a fresh catalyst are almost identical to those<br>
obtained on the same regenerated, catalyst.<br>
These two curves show the significance of the process of<br>
this invention, which propose an alternative functioning of<br>
the same catalyst during oxidation/adsorption, the<br>
oxidation/adsorption time actually been adapted to the<br>
proportion of sulphur.<br><br>
