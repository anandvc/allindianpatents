SYSTEM, METHOD, AND DEVICE FOR PROVIDING COMMUNICATIONS USING A DISTRIBUTED MOBILE ARCHITECTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to the distributed mobile communication systems. <br>
 5      BACKGROUND<br>
Access to basic telephony service is particularly important for rural and isolated communities. Telephony access allows small-scale enterprises, cooperatives, and farmers to obtain accurate information on fair prices for their products and to access regional and national markets. Access also reduces the cost of transportation and supports the local tourist industry. By bringing markets to people<br>
10      	via telecommunications, rather than forcing people to leave in search of markets, urban migration is reduced and greater income and employment potential are generated in rural areas.<br>
Unfortunately, the last decade of the telecommunications boom has not alleviated the disparities between urban and rural communities. The average imbalance, in terms of telephone penetration, in Asia, for example, is over ten to one and is often as high as twenty to 1.2. This means that a country <br>
15      	whose urban markets have a penetration of four (4) telephone lines per one-hundred (100) inhabitants, e.g., India and Pakistan, has a rural penetration of less than 0.2 per one-hundred (100). The situation is more acute in most African countries and in some parts of Latin America. By comparison, the disparity in average income level between urban and rural residents in the developing world is usually less than 4 to I.<br>
20      Current telephone systems are expensive to deploy. For example, a typical cellular system that includes a mobile switching center (MSC), a base station controller (BSC), and a home location register/visitor location register (HLR/VLR) can cost over $2.0 million. Moreover, such a system may require a minimum often thousand users in order to be economically viable. In many rural areas, the population is not large enough to support the installation of such a system. Further, in many cases, the<br>
25      conditions in which the equipment, e.g., the MSC, BSC, and HLR/VLR, are to be operated are<br>
extremely harsh and environmentally prohibitive. An alternative to such a cellular system can include a wired system, but the costs associated with deploying and maintaining land lines are too high for certain rural areas.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved communications system that is relatively inexpensive 30      to deploy and relatively inexpensive to operate.<br>

As shown in FIG. 3, at least one side of the housing 302 is formed with a rib 314 to allow the DMA server 300 to be slid into a server rack (not shown). Further, the DMA server 300 includes a clip 316 that is coupled to the housing 302 via a fastener, e.g., a bolt. The clip 316 can be engaged with a server<br>
20      	rack (not shown) to prevent the DMA server 300 from unintentionally sliding out of the server rack (not shown).<br>
In a particular embodiment, the length 304 of the housing 302 is approximately 76.2 centimeters.<br>
Further, in a particular embodiment, the width 306 of the housing 302 is approximately 48.2<br>
centimeters. Additionally, in a particular embodiment, the height 308 of the housing 302 is <br>

30       than 16,000 centimeters cubed, a footprint area that is less than 4,000 centimeters squared, and a weight<br>
that is less than 20.0 kilograms<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a non-limiting, exemplary embodiment of a distributive and associated telecommunications system is illustrated and is generally designated 400. As depicted in FIG. 4, the system 400 includes four cellular coverage sites 402. Each coverage site 402 includes an antenna 404.<br>
35    	 In one embodiment, the antenna 404 is connected to a transceiver belonging to a base transceiver station (BTS) and the BTS is a 3-sector BTS. FIG. 4 also indicates that a distributed mobile architecture (DMA) server 406 can be connected to each antenna 404. In one embodiment, each DMA<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/052342<br>
 <br>
7<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2005/035648<br>
 <br>
server 406 is physically and directly connected to its respective antenna 404, e.g., by a wire or cable 408. Further, in an illustrative embodiment, the DMA servers 406 can be any of the DMA servers shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, and FIG. 3.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, each DMA server 406 is interconnected with the other DMA servers 406 via an <br>
5 	Internet protocol network 410. As such, there exists a peer-to-peer connection 412 between each DMA server 406 in the system 400. As described in detail below, the DMA servers 406 can handle telephony traffic that is communicated at each antenna 404. For example, the DMA servers 406 can switch and route calls received via each antenna 404. Additionally, the DMA servers 406 can hand-off calls to each other as mobile communication devices move around and between the cellular coverage sites 402. <br>
10      The DMA servers 406 can communicate with each other via the IP network 410 and can further<br>
transmit calls to each other via the IP network 410. It should be understood that more than four cellular coverage sites 402 can be included in the system and that the inclusion of only four cellular coverage sites 402 in FIG. 4 is merely for clarity and explanation purposes.<br>
Within the distributed and associative telecommunications system 400 the controlling logic can be <br>
15      	distributed and de-centralized. Moreover, the wireless coverage provided by the disclosed system 400 is self-healing and redundant. In other words, due to the interconnectivity via the IP network 410, if one or more of the DMA servers 406 loses powers, fails, or is otherwise inoperable, telephony traffic handled by the inoperable DMA server 406 can re-routed to one of the remaining operable DMA servers 406. Additionally, user data stored in a database, e.g., a home locator resource (HLR) or a <br>
20      	visitor locator resource (VLR), can be distributed equally and fully among all of the DMA servers 406. It can also be appreciated mat new cellular coverage sites can be easily added to the system 400 as the demand for users increases. Specifically, a DMA server can be deployed as described below, connected to an antenna, connected to the IP network, and activated to provided cellular coverage in a new area.<br>
25      	FIG. 5 shows an exemplary, non-limiting, detailed embodiment of a DMA server, e.g., one of the DMA servers 406 described in conjunction with FIG. 4. Further, any of the DMA servers 100,200,300 shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, and FIG. 3 can include the components depicted in FIG. 5 and described herein.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the DMA server 406 is essentially a processor, or computer, having a <br>
30      	housing and a computer readable medium 500 that is disposed therein.. A power supply 502 can also be disposed within the housing of the DMA server 406 in order to provide power to the DMA server 406. The power supply 502 can be a rechargeable battery disposed within the DMA server 406 or it can be external to the DMA server 406, i.e., a standard power outlet. Moreover, a cooling system 504, e.g., a fan with a thermostat, can be within the DMA server 406 in order to keep the DMA server 406 from <br>
35      overheating. In an alternative embodiment, the DMA server 406 can be a single board processor that does not require a fan.<br>

 <br>
As depicted in FIG. 5, the DMA server 406 can include a mobile switching center (MSC) module 506 and a base station controller (BSC) module 508 embedded within the computer readable medium 500. In an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment, the MSC module 506 can include a gatekeeper (GK) 510 that is connected to several gateways. For example, a circuit gateway (CGW) 512 can be connected to <br>
5      	the GK 510 and can provide connectivity to an integrated services digital network/public switched telephone network (ISDN/PSTN) interface 514. The CGW 512 can provide a circuit switched to packet data conversion. In an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment, the PSTN portion of the ISDN/PSTN interface 514 can be an inter-office interface that uses the Bellcore industry standard ISDN user part (ISUP) signaling on a signaling system seven (SS7) link set. Moreover, the voice <br>
10      	trunks on this interface can be timeslots on a Tl connection. Inbound and outbound voice calls can be supported on the ISDN portion of the ISDN/PSTN interface 514.<br>
As further illustrated in FIG. 5, a packet data server node (PDSN) gateway 516 for CDMA, or a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) for Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), and a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway 518 can also be connected to the GK 510. The PDSN <br>
15      	gateway 516 and the SIP gateway 518 can provide connectivity to an Internet protocol (DP) interface 520. Further, the PDSN gateway 516 or a GGSN can establish a reverse tunnel with the PDSN or GGSN gateway 516 using generic routing encapsulation (GRE). Moreover, the PDSN gateway 516, or GGSN, can implement the Pseudo Random Function (PRF)/ Foreign Agent (FA) functionality of the DMA server 406 which supports mobile IP functions.<br>
20      	FIG. 5 further shows an SS7 gateway 522 that provides connectivity to an ANSI-41 and GSM Mobile Application Part (MAP) interface 524. In a particular embodiment, the AN SI-41 interface can be an SS7 TCAP/SCCP interface on the same SS7 link set used for ISUP signaling.

Further, in an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment, the GSM MAP<br>
25      	interface can be an SS7 TCAP/SCCP interface on the same SS7 link set used for ISUP signaling. It can be appreciated that there are different protocols of MAP from MAP/B to MAP/I, but in the illustrative embodiment, the different MAP/x protocols are not stacked - they are used independently.<br>

As illustrated in FIG. 5, the BSC module 508 includes a cellular radio network controller (CRNC) 530 and a cellular selection/distribution unit (CSDU) 532 that are connected to a call protocol controller <br>
5      	(CPC) 534. In turn, the CPC 534 can be connected to a plurality of base transceiver stations (BTSs) 536. Specifically, the DMA server 406 includes a BTS interface 538 at the CPC 534 that can be physically and directly connected to the BTSs 536. The CRNC 530 can provide cellular radio resource management and cellular call control. The CSDU 532 can provide Fundamental Channel (FCH) soft handoff and distribution, Link Access Control (LAC) processing for inband signaling, multiplexer <br>
10      (MUX) functions, and centralized power control. Further, the CPC 534 can convert a Tl or El message or ATM interface to a data packet message. In a particular embodiment, each BTS 536 supports signals and traffic up to the front point of the CPC 534, e.g., up to the BTS interface 538. Further, in a particular embodiment, the CRNC 530, the CPC 534, the CSDU 532 and the OAMP 540 can perform one or more of the functions of legacy Base Station Controllers (BSC).<br>

In an illustrative embodiment, the CPC 534 can be connected to one or more BTSs 536. FIG. 5 further shows that the BSC module 508 includes an operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAMP) module 540. In an<br>
20      exemplary, non-limiting embodiment, the OAMP module 540 can use simple network management protocol (SNMP) for operations interfaces. Further, the OAMP module 540 can include a JAVA user interface. The OAMP module 540 can also include a software agent that is assigned to each component within the DMA server 406. The agents independently monitor their respective components. Moreover, each agent can provision its respective component.<br>
25      Referring to FIG. 6, an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a flow chart is provided to illustrate operating logic of a DMA server 406 (FIG. 4). The operating logic commences at block 600 with a function loop wherein during operation, the succeeding steps are performed. At step 602, a call is received, e.g., at an antenna 404 (FIG. 4) in communication with a DMA server 406 (FIG. 4). Next, at decision step 604 it is determined whether the call is local, i.e., it is determined whether the call is<br>
30      between two mobile communication devices within the same cellular coverage site. If the call is local, the logic moves to block 606, and the call is switched at the local DMA server, i.e., the DMA server within the cellular coverage site in which the call is received. Then, at block 608, the call is connected from the first mobile communication device that initiated the call to a second mobile communication device via the local DMA server. Returning to decision step 604, if the call is not local, the logic<br>
35      proceeds to block 610 and the call is switched at the DMA server connected to the antenna 404 at which the call was received. Thereafter, at block 612, the call is connected from the first mobile communication device that initiated the call to a second mobile communication device via a peer-to-peer connection between a first DMA server and a second DMA server.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/052342<br>
 <br>
10<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2005/035648<br>
 <br>
After the call is connected, either at block 608 or block 612, the logic continues to block 614 where the call is monitored. For example, the location of the first mobile communication device that initiated the call can be monitored, the location of the second mobile communication device that received the call can be monitored, the DMA server that is handling the call can be monitored, other DMA servers<br>
5      through which the call is connected can be monitored, and the connections (such as the peer-to-peer IP network connection) through which the call is transmitted can be monitored. Proceeding to decision step 616, it is determined if the first mobile communication device or the second mobile communication device involved in the call is roaming, i.e., moving between cellular coverage sites provided by individual antennas. If so, the logic moves to block 618 where the call at the roaming<br>
10      mobile communication device is automatically handed off to a new DMA server and associated<br>
antenna at a new cellular coverage site. If none of the mobile communication devices involved in the call is roaming, the logic moves to decision step 620.<br>
At decision step 620, it is determined whether any DMA server has failed. If so, the call is re-routed around the failed DMA server by establishing one or more different peer-to-peer connections between<br>
15      one or more different DMA servers that are still operable. Thereafter, the logic moves to decision step 624. Decision step 624 can also be reached if it is determined that no DMA servers have failed at decision step 620. At decision step 624, it is determined whether the call has ended. If not, the logic moves to block 626 and the connection or connections through which the call has been established are maintained. Otherwise, if the call has ended, the logic moves to block 628 and the peer-to-peer<br>
20      connection, or connections, through which the call was established are terminated, and the logic ends, at state 630.<br>
FIG. 7 depicts a flow chart to illustrate call hand-offlogic that can be performed by a DMA server 406 (FIG. 4) in order to hand off calls, or user service connections, between a first BTS and a second BTS as a mobile communication device moves between cellular coverage zones. The logic commences at<br>
25      block 700 with a loop wherein when a mobile communication device is activated, the following steps are performed. At block 702, the location of a mobile communication device is monitored at a local DMA server. Continuing to decision step 704, it is determined if the mobile communication device is about to move from a first cellular coverage site provided by a first BTS to a second cellular coverage site provided by a second BTS. If not, the logic moves to decision step 706 where it is determined<br>
30      whether the call has terminated. If the call terminates, the logic ends at state 708. On the other hand, if the call does not terminate, the logic returns to block 702 and continues as described above.<br>
Returning to decision step 704, if the user is about to move from a first cellular coverage site provided by a first BTS to a second cellular coverage site by a second BTS, the logic proceeds to decision step 710. At decision step 710, it is determined whether the second BTS is connected locally, i.e., to the <br>
35      	same DMA server as the first BTS, If so, the logic moves to block 712 and the DMA server handsoff the call, e.g., as a soft hand off, or the user service connection, from a first BTS connected to the DMA server to a second BTS connected to the same DMA server. Conversely, if the second BTS is not local, the logic continues to block 714 where the DMA server hands off the call from a first BTS connected<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/052342<br>
 <br>
11<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2005/035648<br>
 <br>
to the DMA server to a second BTS connected to a second DMA server. From block 712 or block 714, the logic proceeds to decision step 706 and continues as described above.<br>
FIG. 8 portrays an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a method to illustrate group call logic that can be executed at a DMA 406 (FIG. 4) to provide a group call between several mobile communication<br>
 5       devices and PSTN/ISDN users. At block 800, a loop is entered wherein during operation, the<br>
following steps are performed. At decision step 802, it is determined whether greater than three (3) callers are participating in a telephone call handled via one or more DMA servers 406 (FIG. 4). If not, the logic continues to block 804 and normal calling, e.g., two-way calling, three-party conference calling, etc., is allowed. The logic then ends at state 806.<br>
10      At decision step 802, if greater than three (3) callers are participating in a telephone call that is handled via one or more DMA servers 406 (FIG. 4), the logic moves to block 808 and group calling is allowed between all participants with full duplex capability. Next, at decision step 810, it is determined whether one or more participants have disconnected. If so, at decision block 812, the disconnected participant or participants are dropped from the group call. At block 814, full duplex calling is<br>
15      maintained between the remaining group call participants. Returning to decision step 810, if no<br>
participants have disconnected, the logic proceeds to decision step 816 where it is determined whether a new participant has connected to the group call. Decision step 816 is also reached from block 814, above.<br>
At decision step 816, if a new participant enters the group call, the new participant is allowed to <br>
20      	connect to the group call and may communicate with any one or more of the other participants with full duplex capability. The logic then moves to decision step 820. Decision step 820 is also reached from decision step 816 if no new participants have entered the group call. At decision step 820, it is determined whether all participants have disconnected from the group call. If not, the logic returns to block 808 and continues as described above. On the other hand, if all participants have disconnected <br>
25      from the group call, the logic moves to block 822 where the group call is terminated and then ends at state 806.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a telecommunications system is shown and is generally designated 900. As shown, the system includes one or more DMA servers 902 that are connected to a wireless carrier's central MSC 904. The DMA servers) 902 can be connected<br>
30      	to the MSC 904 via an El CCS (G.703, G732) connection, or any other applicable connection. The MSC 904, in turn, is connected to a code division multiple access (CDMA) network 906. FIG. 9 further shows that the DMA server(s) 902 can be connected to a switching transfer point (STP) 908 of a stand-alone carrier.

5       Referring to FIG. 10, a wireless local loop (WLL) system is portrayed and is generally designated 1000. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the system 1000 includes a DMA server 1002 that is connected to a BTS 1004. The BTS 1004, in rum, is connected to an antenna 1006. The antenna 1006 provides cellular coverage for one or more subscribers 1008 within transmission distance of the antenna 1006. FIG. 10 indicates that the system 1000 can further include a data network connection 1010 from the<br>
10      DMA server 1002. The data network connection 1010 can connect the DMA server 1002 to the PSTN via an ISUP/ISDN signaling connection on an SS7 link set or a Tl/El wireless connection. Further, the data network connection 1010 can be an IEEE 802.il connection between the DMA server 1002 depicted in FIG. 10 and other DMA servers not shown. The DMA server 1002 can beneficially utilize existing infrastructure used for cellular and SMS data services.<br>
15      FIG. 11 shows a multi-WLL system, generally designated 1100. As shown, the system 1100 includes a plurality of WLLs 1102. Each WLL 1102 can include a DMA server 1104 and an antenna 1106 connected thereto to provide a cellular coverage site around the antenna 1106. As illustrated in FIG. 11, the WLLs 1102 can be interconnected via a wireless local area network (WLAN), or a wide area network, such as a microwave connection. Moreover, a DMA server 1104 within one of the WLLs<br>
20       1102 can provide a back-haul connection 1108 to the PSTN 1110. This type of deployment scenario can greatly reduce the costs associated with a wireless system. Since the DMA servers 1104 are connected to each other via the WLAN or microwave connections, the relatively expensive inter-site back-haul component is removed. Further, using the hand-off logic, the DMA servers 1104 can enable roaming between the WLLs 1102 and can further provide roaming to an external wireless or other<br>
25      network.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, a telecommunications system is depicted and is designated 1200. As illustrated in FIG. 12, the system 1200 includes a DMA server 1202 that can be connected to a plurality of BTSs 1204.

30       	12 further shows that the DMA server 1202 can be connected to an MSC 1208, such as an MSC of an existing cellular system. The DMA server 1202 can be connected to the MSC via an IS-41 subset or a MAP subset over a wireless El/Tl connection. With this implementation, the DMA server 1202 can exend an existing cellular network when connected to an existing cellular system MSC 1208.<br>

As illustrated in FIG. 13, the urban fringe/nearby village coverage site 1304 includes a DMA server 1314 having a plurality of BTSs 1316 connected thereto. The DMA server 1314 can provide hand-off <br>
5      	of calls between the BTSs 1316 and can switch calls made between the BTSs 1316 locally. However, the DMA server 1314 within the urban fringe/nearby village coverage site 1304 can also connect telephony traffic to the first MSC/BSC center 1306 within the city area coverage site 1302 via a data network connection 1318. In one embodiment, the data network connection can be an El connection, a Tl connection, a microwave connection, or an 802.11 connection established via an IS-41 subset or<br>
10      MAP subset. The deployment of a DMA server 1314 in a location such as that described above, i.e., in urban fringe or in a nearby village, and the connection of the DMA server 1314 to an MSC/BSC center 1306 in a city area, can provide service to potential wireless customers that typically would not receive cellular coverage from the city area cellular coverage site 1302. Thus, new subscribers receive access to wireless communication service and can further communicate with wireless customers within the<br>
15      city area cellular coverage site 1302.<br>

20      	1408 that provides a back-haul connection to the PSTN 1410. In one embodiment, the data network connection can be an El connection, a Tl connection, a cable connection, a microwave connection, or a satellite connection. Moreover, the system 1400 depicted in FIG. 14 can be deployed using CDMA IS-95, CDMA IX, GSM/GPRS, W-CDMA, or other industry standard technologies.<br>
Using a single back-haul connection greatly minimizes costs associated with the wireless <br>
25      	communication network. Further, the system 1400 shown in FIG. 14 can be deployed relatively rapidly and can be maintained remotely. Additionally, with the inclusion of the OAMP module 540 (FIG. 5) and the AAA module 528 (FIG. 5), subscriber accounts can be managed locally and billing can be performed locally, i.e., within the DMA server 1402, Moreover, as the number of subscribers increase, the size of the system can be increased modularly, e.g., by adding DMA servers, corresponding BTSs,<br>
30      and the appropriate connections.<br>

Referring to FIG. 22, a method of deploying a distributed management architecture server is shown and<br>
25      	commences at block 2200 wherein during deployment, the succeeding steps are performed. At block 2202, the DMA server is moved to a desired location proximate to a BTS. Moving to block 2204, the DMA server is opened. For example, if the DMA server is the DMA server shown in FIG. 1, the latch is unlocked and the lid is rotated about the hinges into the open position. Proceeding to block 2206, a physical connection is established between the DMA server and the BTS, e.g., the BTS is coupled to <br>
30      the DMA server via a wire.<br>
Continuing to block 2208, the DMA server is activated, e.g., powered on. At block 2210, a network connection is established with another remote DMA server. In a particular embodiment, the network connection is a peer-to-peer connection between the DMA servers. Moving to block 2212, DMA server software within the DMA server is activated. Thereafter, at decision step 2214, it is determined <br>
35      	whether the system is operational. That decision can be a performed by the DMA server, e.g., by a self-diagnostic routine or module within the DMA server. Alternatively, that decision can be<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/052342<br>
 <br>
17<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2005/035648<br>
 <br>
determined manually by a technician. If the system is not operational, a system check is performed at block 2216. In a particular embodiment, the system check performed at block 2216 is performed by a self-diagnostic routine or module within the DMA server. On the other hand, a technician can perform the system check. After the system check, the logic then returns to decision step 2214 and continues <br>
5      	as described herein. At decision step 2214, if the system is operational, the method proceeds to block 2218 and call transmission is allowed. The method then ends at state 2220.<br>
Referring to FIG. 23, a method of deploying a distributed management architecture server is shown and commences at block 2300 wherein a direct physical connection between a first DMA server and a base transceiver station is disconnected. At block 2302, the first DMA server is removed. Proceeding to <br>
10      block 2304, a second DMA server is moved to a location that is substantially proximate to the base<br>
transceiver station. At block 2306, the second DMA server is opened. For example, if the DMA server is the DMA server shown in FIG. 1, the latch is unlocked and the lid is rotated about the hinges into the open position. Next, at block 2308, a direct physical connection is established between the second DMA server and the base transceiver station.<br>
15      Continuing to block 2310, the second DMA server is activated. At block 2312, a network connection is established between the second DMA server and another remote DMA server. In a particular embodiment, the network connection is a peer-to-peer IP connection between the DMA servers. Further, in a particular embodiment, the peer-to-peer connection is established via a private IP network. At block 2314, DMA server software within the second DMA server is activated.<br>
20      Proceeding to decision step 2316, it is determined whether the system is operational. That decision can be a performed by the second DMA server, e.g., by a self-diagnostic routine or module within the second DMA server. Alternatively, the decision can be determined manually by a technician. If the system is not operational, a system check is performed at block 2318. In a particular embodiment, the system check performed at block 2318 is performed by a self-diagnostic routine or module within the<br>
25      second DMA server. On the other hand, a technician can perform the system check. After the system check, the logic then returns to decision step 2316 and continues as described herein. At decision step 2316, if the system is operational, the method proceeds to block 2320 and call transmission is allowed via the second DMA server. The method then ends at state 2322.<br>
With the configuration of structure described above, the present disclosure provides a flexible <br>
30      	telecommunications device, i.e., the DMA server 406 (FIG. 4), that is distributive and associative, i.e., it can operate stand-alone or seamlessly within an existing cellular or other network. Moreover, the DMA server 406 can be integrated with virtually any third party base station. The DMA server 406 can operate with multiple air interfaces including CDMA IS-95, CDMA IX, CDMA EVDO, GSM, GPRS, W-CDMA, 802.11 (Wi-fi), 802.16 (Wi-fi), etc. Further, the DMA server 406 can provide <br>
35      	integrated prepaid billing, OAMP, network management, and AAA functionality. The DMA server 406 can include a Java based user interface and feature configuration system. Also, the DMA server 406 can provide real time call metering, call detail record (CDR) generation, and real time call provisioning. The DMA server 406 may be implemented in a relatively small footprint and has a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/052342<br>
 <br>
18<br>
 <br>

 <br>
relatively low power requirement. Further, the DMA server 406 may be implemented using inexpensive and widely available computer equipment<br>
With one or more of the deployment configurations described above, the present system provides mobile to landline calls from mobile handsets within a DMA server cellular coverage area. Also, <br>
 5      	mobile to landline calls can be made from mobile handsets roaming into DMA coverage areas. Mobile to mobile calls can be made from home/roaming handsets to DMA handsets and vice versa. Further, mobile to IP calls and IP to mobile calls can be made from within a DMA server coverage area. IP to IP calls can be made from any DMA handset to any IP phone. Additionally, IP to landline calls and landline to IP calls can be made from a DMA handset to any phone. Further, land-line to mobile calls<br>
10      to DMA handsets can be made.<br>
The systems described above can support call forwarding, call waiting, 3-way calling caller ID, voice mail, and mobile to mobile SMS service, i.e., text messaging. Further, the systems described above can provide broadcast SMS service, mobile to land high-speed IP data (IX or GPRS) service and mobile-to-mobile high speed IP data (IX or GPRS) service. Also, the systems described above can provide IP-<br>
15      PBX capability.<br>
Further, one or more of the illustrated systems can provide IP transport between distributed elements, e.g., DMA servers 406 (FIG. 4). Packet back-haul from BTS to RAN can be provided. Further, the control logic within the DMA servers 406 (FIG. 4) can be distributed and associated. Associated systems can be redundant, self-healing, self-organizing, and scalable. Distributed systems can be <br>
20      	"snap-together," i.e., a DMA server 406 (FIG. 4) can be linked to a previously deployed DMA server 406 (FIG. 4) in order to broaden, or otherwise extend, cellular coverage. Further, distributed systems can be de-centralized to avoid single points of failure.<br>
One or more of the systems described above can also provide soft and softer call handoffs on the same frequency interfaces. Also, soft handoffs can be provided on different systems. Further, a DMA based<br>
25      	system can operate stand-alone with a billing system provided by a DMA server and CDR generation. Or, a system can use the SS7 network to pass CDRs to a central switch for integrated billing and operation with an existing network.<br>
The above-disclosed subject matter is to be considered illustrative, and not restrictive, and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications, enhancements, and other embodiments, <br>
30      	which fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.
