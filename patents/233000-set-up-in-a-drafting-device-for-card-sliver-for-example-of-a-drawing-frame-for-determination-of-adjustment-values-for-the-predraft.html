				<td>Sat up in a drafting device for Card Sliver for example<br>
of a drawing frame for determination of adjustment values<br>
for the predraft.<br>
The invention refers to a sat up at a drafting device for<br>
card sliver, for example of a drawing frame for<br>
determination of adjustment values for the predraft,<br>
wherein the ratio of circumferential speed of middle to<br>
feed bottom roll of drafting device is changeable, in<br>
order to change the draft and in which measurement values<br>
of a variable characterizing the draft force in main-<br>
and/or pre draft field are admissible.<br>
In a known device it is provided that in a pre draft<br>
field a pressure bar is present for the daflection of<br>
fibre structure to which a measuring item is allocated,<br>
with which a signal depending on the contact pressure of<br>
the fibre structure on the pressure bar is generated.<br>
From the contact pressure the draft force is derived.<br>
The assignment lies at the base of the invention to<br>
procure a drafting device of the type described at the<br>
8ntry which improves yet further particularly the<br>
matching of drafting device in each range change and/or<br>
in quality change of produced fibre object.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place, through the<br>
characteristic features of claim 1 .<br>
Through the measures as per invention, it gets to improve<br>
the matching (adjustment) of the drafting device yet<br>
essentially. Out of the electric signals, in simple way<br>
undesirable deviations of desired variables for example<br>
machine related and/or fibre technological values in each<br>
range change and/or in quality changes of produced fibre<br>
object is identified. Therein the type and size of<br>
deviation is determined. Advantageously undesired<br>
deviations in operation can be identified and operating<br>
persons can serve for matching of drafting device for<br>
example change of clamping line distances and/or of<br>
drafts. The invention allous also a computerwise<br>
evaluation and a corresponding matching of drafting<br>
device on ground of evaluation results either through<br>
operating persons self operatingly (automatic) through<br>
the Computer in combination uith the regulating drafting<br>
device.<br>
The claims 2 to 2b have advantageous further developments<br>
in content.<br>
The invention is closer explained follouingly uith the<br>
help of diagramatically represented execution<br>
examples,<br>
It shows :<br>
Figure 1. Schematically in side view a regulating<br>
drawing frame uith the device as per<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 2 Current input at the middle roll depending on<br>
pre draft rolls (pre draft level).<br>
Figure 3 a function betuean the draft force and the pre<br>
draft values (pre draft level) uith a slope<br>
end area.<br>
Figure 4 a function between the draft force and the pre<br>
draft values (pre draft level) and a slope end<br>

Figure 5 a function between the pre draft force and the<br>
pre draft distances with a slope area and;<br>
Figure 6 a function between the draft force and the<br>
main draft distances with a slope end point.<br>
As per figure 1 a drawing frame 1 for example<br>
Truetzschler - drauing frame HSR shous a drafting device<br>
2 to which a drafting device entry 3 in prelaid and a<br>
drafting device exit 4 is post laid. The card slivers 5<br>
come out of cans (not represented), coming in the tape<br>
guide 6 and drawn through the draw boxes 7,8 are<br>
transported past the measuring element 9. The drafting<br>
device 2 is conceived as 4-over-3-drafting device that<br>
means it comprise of three bottom rolls I, II, III (I<br>
withdrawal bottom roll, II-middle bottom roll, Ill-<br>
feed bottom roll) and four top rolls, 11, 12, 13, 14.<br>
in drafting device 2 the draft of fibre structure 51V/<br>
takes place out of multiple number of card slivers 5.<br>
The draft is composed of pre draft and main draft. The<br>
roll pairs 14III and 13/II form the pre draft field and<br>
the roll pairs 13/II and 11, 12/II form the main draft<br>
field. In pre draft field the fibre structure 5'and in<br>
main draft field the fibre structure 5" is stretched.<br>
The stretched card slivers 5' reach in drafting device<br>
out let 4, a non woven guide 10 and are drawn by means<br>
of draw boxes 15, 16 through a sliver funnel 17 in<br>
which they are bunched together to a card sliver 18 which<br>
is deposited followingly in can. With A the working<br>
direction is denoted.<br>
The draw boxes 7,8 and the feed bottom rolls III which<br>
are for example mechanically coupled over tooth type<br>
belt,are driven by the variable speed motor 19 wherein a<br>
set value is to be specified.(Theassociated top roll 14<br>
runs along). The middle-bottom roll II is driven by the<br>
variable speed middle motor 32 (The associated top roll<br>
13 runs along). The exit-bottom roll I and the draw boxes<br>
15, 16 are driven by the main motor 20. The variable<br>
speed motor 19, the drive motor 32 and the main motor 20<br>
have each at their disposal over an internal automatic<br>
controller 21, 33 or rather 22. The automatic controller<br>
21 , 33 and 22 remain each in link with the electrical<br>
terminals of motors 19, 32 or rather 22. The automatic<br>
control (speed control) takes place in each case over a<br>
closed loop control circuit wherein a tachometer<br>
generator 23 is allocated to automatic speed control<br>
motor 19, a tacometer generator 34 and a tachometer<br>
generator 24 are allocated to middle motor 32 and the<br>
main motor 20 respectively. At the drafting device entry<br>
3 a variable proportional to the measurements as for<br>
example the cross section of fed-in card-sliver 5 is<br>
measured by an inlet measuring element 9, uhich is knoun<br>
as for example from the DE-A-4404326. At the drafting<br>
device outlet 4, the cross section (thickness) of the<br>
emerged card sliver 13 is obtained by an outlet<br>
measuring item 25 allocated to the sliver funnel 17,<br>
uhich is knoun as for example out of the DE-A-19537983.<br>
A central computer unit 25 (control-and regulating<br>
equipment) as for example micro computer uith micro<br>
processor, communicates an adjustment of reference<br>
variable for the variable spead control motor 19 to the<br>
automatic controller 21 . The measured quantities of both<br>
the measuring elements 9 or rather 25 are communicated<br>
during draft process to the central computer unit 25.<br>
From the measured quantities of entry measuring element<br>
9 and from the reference values for the cross section of<br>
emerging card sliver 18 the reference value for the<br>
variable speed control motor 19 is determined in the<br>
central computer unit 26. The measured quantities of<br>
outlet measuring items 25 serve the monitoring of<br>
emerging card sliver 18 (output sliver monitoring).<br>
There takes place an online-communication of optimum pre<br>
draft. Uith the help of this control system,<br>
fluctuations in the cross section of fed-in card sliver<br>
5 can be compensated through corresponding control of<br>
draft process or rather a homogenization of card sliver<br>
can be reached. Uith 27 a display screen, with 28 an<br>
interface, uith 29 an input equipment and uith 30 a<br>
pressure rod are denoted.<br>
A measuring element 35 for the current input of middle<br>
motor is present which is the useful component of drive<br>
module of activating unit 33. The measuring element 35<br>
remains in link with the electrical terminal of middle<br>
motor 32. The measured values from the measuring item<br>
35 are supplied over the automatic controller 33 to a<br>
memory 31 in computer 26. The device as per invention<br>
makes possible the direct communication of adjustment<br>
values for the pre draft. Uith the help of fibre<br>
structure 5 a multiple number of measured values of<br>
current input are admitted over the measuring item 35,<br>
out of which in the control and regulating equipment 26<br>
as for example micro computer, the function between the<br>
measured values of current input (that means one of the<br>
variables characterizing the draft force) and the pre<br>
draft values as per figure 2 are found out, which is<br>
drawnup for adjustment of an optimum pre draft.<br>
Uith the device as per invention at the drawing frame<br>
the optimum pre draft level is determined and adjusted.<br>
Through it, that on line at the drawing frame the<br>
optimum pre draft level can be determined, the crimp of<br>
drafting sliver for the drafting process can be<br>
realistically described. These measures form an<br>
important step to a self optimising drawing frame. The<br>
assignment of the pre draft exists therein, to pull the<br>
crimp out of the fibres. There exists a pre draft point,<br>
in which the crimp is pulled straight out of the<br>
fibres. Below and above this optimum draft level the<br>
quality is worse. Therefore this optimum pre draft level<br>
at drawing sliver can be described through a measured<br>
quantity.<br>
In case the crimped fibres enter from the pre draft to<br>
the main draft field of the drawing frame then it gives<br>
for the draft force in main draft an other level than<br>
when fibres stretched fully to the pre draft enter in<br>
the main draft area. This draft force change covers so<br>
that the optimum draft level can be determined. The<br>
optimum pre draft level corresponds to just fully<br>
stretched fibres in pre draft.<br>
In Fig.3 schematically a function between the pre draft<br>
force and the pre draft values (pre draft level) with a<br>
slope end area is represented. The slope end area which<br>
shows a turn back point represents the optimum pre draft<br>
level.<br>
The draft force directly or indirectly can be determined<br>
over a variable characterising the draft force for<br>
example the current input at middle motor.<br>
In Figure 4 a function between the draft force and the<br>
pre draft values with a slope end area is represented,<br>
which gives optimum pre draft level. The slope end point<br>
is a prominent point, at which the slope does not<br>
increase any more or is reduced significantly. The slope<br>
end point can be found out through it that the measured<br>
values of the curve is reflected through two<br>
approximated (neared) straight lines computerwise and/or<br>
figure wise and the point of inter section of both the<br>
straight lines is drawn up for adjustment of optimum<br>
predraft.<br>
The device as per invention can be drawn also for<br>
adjustment of an optimum pre draft distance and main<br>
draft distance (clamp line distance). Figure 5 shows<br>
schematically a function between the draft force and the<br>
pre draft distances with a slope end area. Figure 6<br>
shows schematically a function between the draft force<br>
and the main draft distances with a slope end point.<br>
The invention is represented at the example of a<br>
drafting device of a drawing frame. All drafting devices<br>
however at spinning machines, as for example ring<br>
spinning machine, combing machine, card and the<br>
equivalent are covered.<br>
The invention is applicable in a controlled or<br>
uncontrolled drafting device.<br>
