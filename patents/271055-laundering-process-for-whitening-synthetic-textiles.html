Laundering process for whitening synthetic textiles<br>
The present invention relates to the use of a free fluorescent whitening agent and a cationic polymer in a laundering process for brightening a synthetic, single or blended textile, to novel fluorescent whitening agents, and to novel brightening compositions.<br>
Usually, synthetic textile, especially polyester, is brightened during its process of preparation or dyeing, wherein high temperatures from about 120째C are applied. There is still a demand to brighten polyester also in domestic laundering processes, where only lower tempertures from 30 to 60째C are applicable.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is to find a process for the domestic brightening of synthetic and especially polyester fabric. It has been found that, surprisingly, a combination of a free flowing fluorescent whitener and a cationic polymer, when added to the wash cycle, achieves an excellent brightening effect on synthetic textiles, especially those based on polyester.<br>
Thus, the present invention primarily pertains to the use of a combination of a free fluorescent whitening agent and cationic polymer as a brightening agent for a synthetic single or blended textile.<br>
The laundering process leads to brightening of the synthetic, single or blended textile, especially polyester or polyamide textiles or polyester or polyamide blended textiles, wherein the blended textile preferably comprises at least 40% by weight, preferably at least 50% by weight, of polyester or polyamide. The process is characterized by<br>
a)	preparing a composition by bringing into contact a free fluorescent whitening agent with a cationic polymer, and<br>
b)	treating said synthetic, single or blended textile with the composition prepared in step a).<br>
In the general context of the present invention, a laundering process covers all processes, wherein detergents and/or softeners are used. Especially preferred is the first or second wash cycle, wherein the textile is treated with a detergent and water in liquor ratio such as 1:4 or higher and in a temperature range of below 100째C, especially about 10 to about 60째C.<br><br>
In the context of the present invention, the fluorescent whitening agent employed is a free fluorescent whitener, i.e. free molecular compound used as such or used in a mixture with other compounds, in non-encapsulated form.<br>

One important physical form is the so-called concentrated granular form adapted to be added to a washing machine.<br>
Of importance are also the so-called compact (or supercompact) detergents. In the field of detergent manufacture, a trend has developed recently towards the production of compact detergents, which contain increased amounts of active substance. In order to minimize energy expenditure during the washing process, the compact detergents are required to operate efficiently at temperatures as low as 40째C, or even at room temperatures, e.g. at 25X. Such detergents usually contain only low amounts of fillers or processing aids, like sodium sulfate or sodium chloride. The amount of such fillers is usually 0-10% by weight, preferably 0-5 % by weight, especially 0-1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent. Such detergents usually have a bulk density of 650-1000 g/l, preferably 700-1000 g/l and especially 750-1000 g/l.<br>
The detergents can also be present in the form of tablets. Relevant characteristics of tablets are ease of dispensing and convenience in handling. Tablets are the most compact delivery of solid detergents and have a bulk density of, for example, 0.9 to 1.3 kg/litre. To enable fast disintegration laundering detergent tablets generally contain special disintegrants:<br>
-	Effervescents such as carbonate/hydrogencarbonate/citric acid;<br>
-	swelling agents like cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, cross-linked poly(N-vinylpyrrollidone);<br>
-	quickly dissolving materials such as Na (K) acetate, or Na (K) citrate;<br>
-	rapidly dissolving water-soluble rigid coating such as dicarboxy acids.<br>
The tablets can also contain combinations of any of the above disintegrants.<br>
Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions can contain other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically<br><br>
10% to 50% of such carriers. The detergents can also be present as the so-called "unit liquid dose" form.<br>
If desired, the detergent composition, the liquid detergent compositions and softening compositions may contain further components, such as those already described above for the liquid and solid formulations comprising a fluorescent whitening agent.<br>
The process is usually conducted in the temperature range of from 5 to 100 C, especially 5 to 60째C. Preferred is a temperature range of 5 to 40째C, especially 5 to 35X and more preferably 5 to 30째C.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 11. Laundering products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalines, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Machine laundering methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundering with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundering detergent composition in accordance with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant, e.g., from 20 g to 300 g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 85 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundering methods. Examples are<br>
-	top-loading, vertical axis U.S.-type automatic washing machines using about 45 to 83 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 14 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 10 to about 50X;<br>
-	front-loading, horizontal-axis European-type automatic washing machine using about 8 to 15 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 60 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 30 to about 95째C;<br>
-	top-loading, vertical-axis Japanese-type automatic washing machine using about 26 to 52 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 8 to about 15 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 5 to about 25X.<br><br>

-	the cationic polymer is added to the detergent or softening composition, and then the fluorescent whitening agent is added.<br>
