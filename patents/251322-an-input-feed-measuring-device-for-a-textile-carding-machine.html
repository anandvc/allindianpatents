FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an input feed measuring device for a textile carding machine. The device of the present invention is useful for sensing and controlling the variation in feed material delivered to the feed rollers of a carding machine in order to effect control over the feed material to achieve reduction in coefficient of variation in the sliver delivered by the carding machine. This invention also relates to an improved sensing plate assembly useful for the incorporation into the input feed device of the present invention. More particularly the present invention relates to an input feed measuring device for a textile carding machine.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In a carding machine the out put sliver quality depends on the uniformity in weight per unit length of the feed material either in the form of lap or flock. The material is bound to have variation in weight per unit length both in length wise and width wise in the lap or the flock fed. Since the carding machine adopts higher drafts between the feed rollers and delivery rollers, the variation in the feed material, though very small, is magnified in the resultant out put sliver quality. Width wise variation is likely to occur in the chute due to the reason that the filling of the chute is not uniform.<br>
The method of controlling the feed roller speed to have control over the feed material using the sensors fitted to both ends of the feed rollers is known. In the known method the feed roller moves up and down due to the variation in the weight per unit length of the feed material presented between the feed roller and feed plate against the pre determined applied spring load at both the ends of the feed roller. The movement of the feed roller obtained depends on the variation in the feed material in the length wise direction only and is the cumulative effect on the width. Individual variation on the desired sections cannot be measured.<br><br>
The method of sensing the variation in the mass of feed material along the width of feed roller comprising a sensing roller located prior to the feed roller and driven in synchronization with the feed roller with plurality of sensing plates with plurality of sensing arrangement attached to it for the passage of feed material to the feed roller to sense the variation in feed material in width wise direction is known.<br>
Indian patent applications 1031/MAS/2000, 1032/MAS/2000, 1033/MAS/2000 and Indian patent 203498 describe distinct apparatuses for sensing thickness variation of feed material in a carding machine having distinct features.<br>
Indian patent application 1031/MAS/2000 discloses an apparatus for sensing thickness variation of feed in a carding machine comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets and rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller, plurality of spring loaded sensing plate arranged across the entire width of said sensing roller and located under said sensing roller, the movement of sensing plates are sensed by sensing means located coaxially beneath said bottom stud and fed to a micro processor which averages the values and modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed.<br>
Indian patent application 1032/MAS/2000 discloses a carding machine comprises feed plate and feed roller for feeding fibre batt to the licker in zone of the carding comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller, plurality of spring loaded sensing plates arranged across the entire width of said sensing roller and located under said sensing roller, said sensing plates attached to plurality of input sensing pistons provided in a fluid cylinder, the combined pressure generated by said plurality of sensing pistons provide movement to an out put piston provided on said fluid cylinder, the movement of the out put piston is sensed by a sensing means and<br><br>
fed to a micro processor which modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed.<br>
Indian patent application 1033/MAS/2000 discloses an apparatus for sensing the thickness variation in the feed material in a carding machine comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets and rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller, plurality spring loaded sensing plates provided with sensing stud with spring loading means, the sensing plates are hinged at one end on a hinge bracket, the movement of the sensing stud is magnified by virtue of the hinge bracket arrangement, the movement of sensing plates are sensed by sensing means located coaxially beneath said bottom stud and fed to a micro processor which averages the values and modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed.<br>
In the above arrangements, the sensing and correction of the variation in the feed material in width wise direction is effected by the plurality sensing plates by establishing line contact with the feed material. In the above arrangements the sensing is not accurate because the contact between the sensing roller and the sensing plate is line contact and is also expensive due to the fact they employ additional sensing roller or additional feed roller with parts for sending the feed batt, with associated drive elements.<br>
Indian patent application Indian patent 203498 discloses an apparatus which overcomes the above disadvantages and cost effective as the device consist of parts which perform multiple functions to measure and control as the feed material to licker in roller thus eliminating the additional sensing roller and its associated drive arrangement. The apparatus comprising a plurality of sensing plate assembly (4) arranged along the entire width of the feed roller (6), each said sensing plate assembly (4) being provided with a sensing plate (1) having a curved surface (5) constructed with differential curvature having an radius (R1) at<br><br>
the batt entry region and radius (R2) at the batt exit region, radius R1 is greater than R2 and R1 and R2 are tangential, said sensing plate (1) being attached to a hinge bracket (2) by a hinge pin(3), a bottom sensing rod (11) being attached to the said sensing plate (1), a top sensing rod (12) being attached to the said bottom sensing rod (11), said plurality sensing plate assembly (4) being further provided with pre loading means and being fixed to the feed roller assembly, said plurality sensing plate (1) envelops said feed roller (6) with a passage opening between the said feed roller (6) and the said curved surface (5) of the said sensing plate (1) for the follow of batt, plurality of sensors (14) arranged at a proximity distance to the said top sensing rod (12) and being mounted on a sensor holder (13), said sensor holder (13) being attached to said feed roller assembly, said plurality of sensors (14) being connected to a processing unit (16), the said processing unit (16) being further connected to a drive (17) which is being connected to a motor (18 ), said motor (18) drivingly connected to the said feed roller (6). This arrangement is shown in fig 1 and 2 of the companying drawings.<br>
In the above arrangements sensor target moves in radial path to the proximity sensor and senses the linear distance between them. This leads to error in measuring distance between sensor target and proximity sensor. Two hinge pins are used to attach sensing plate to hinge bracket which create more complication in assembling elements and reduces setting accuracy. The sensing plate having a curved surface constructed with differential curvature having a radius (R1) at the batt entry region creating a negative slope from the chute creates complexities in smooth entry of material.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved input feed measuring device useful in a textile carding machine which overcomes all the drawbacks of the prior art devices and make for better user friendliness, ease of manufacturing and assembly.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved input feed measuring device useful in a textile carding machine which facilitates accurate sensing and controlling of the feed.<br>
