60/487,529, filed July 15, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/503,242,<br>

10	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the use of immunomer compounds and<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents.<br>
Summary of the Related Ar:<br>
15	Recently, several researcher s have demonstrated the validity of the use of<br>
oligonucleotides as immunostimulatory agents in immunotherapy applications. The<br>
observation that phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can induce<br>
immune stimulation has created interest in developing these compounds as a<br>
therapeutic tool. These efforts haw focused on phosphorothioate oligonucleotides<br>
20containing the natural dinucleotide CpG. Kuramoto et al.,Jpn. J. Cancer Res.<br>
83:1128-1131 (1992) teaches that p hosphodiester oligonucleotides containing a<br>
palindrome that includes a CpG dir ucleotide can induce interferon-alpha and gamma<br>
synthesis and enhance natural killer activity. Krieg et al., Nature 371:546-549 (1995)<br>
discloses that phosphorothioate CpG-containing oligonucleotides are<br>
25immunostimulatory. Liang et al.,J Clin. Invest. 98:1119-1129 (1996) discloses that<br>
such oligonucleotides activate human B cells. Moldoveanu et al., Vaccine 16:1216-<br>
124 (1998) teaches that CpG-containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides enhance<br>
immune response against influenza virus. McCluskie and Davis, J. Immunol.<br><br>
161:4463-4466 (1998) teaches that CpG-containing oligonucleotides act as potent<br>
adjuvants, enhancing immune response against hepatitis B surface antigen.<br>
Other modifications of CpG-containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can<br>
also affect their ability to act as modulators of immune response. See, e.g., Zhao et<br>
5al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (1996) 51:173-182; Zhao et al., Biochem Pharmacol.<br>
(1996) 52:1537-1544; Zhao et al., Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. (1997) 7:495-<br>
502; Zhao et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (1999) 9:3453-3458; Zhao et al., Bioorg.<br>
Med. Chem. Lett. (2000) 10:1051-1054; Yu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2000)<br>
10:2585-2588; Yu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2001) 11:2263-2267; and<br>
lOKandimalla et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. (2001) 9:807-813. US Patent No. 6,426,334<br>
shows the promise of these compounds as anti-cancer agents.<br>
Another means by which at immune response may be modulated is through<br>
the therapeutic use of cytokines. Cytokines are soluble molecules that cells of the<br>
immune system produce to control reactions between other cells. Thus, cytokines are<br>
15regulators of humoral and cellular mmunity. An understanding of how T cells<br>
undiate the immune response is cr tical in order to modulate the response. CD4+ T<br>
helper (Th) cells differentiate along; either the Thl or Th2 pathway. The Thl pathway<br>
is important for the generation of cell-mediated immunity and is characterized by the<br>
production of, for example, â€¢ inter eron and interleukin-2 (IL-2). The Th2 response is<br>
20important for the generation of humoral immunity and is characterized by the<br>
production of, for example, IL-4 ar d IL-5. The Thl response is known to be critical<br>
for immune system defense againsi infections, e.g., viral infections, and immune<br>
system surveillance of the body for the removal of neoplastic cells.<br>
Krieg, A., M. et al. (U.S. Patent No. 6,429,199) and Krieg, A., M. et al. (U.S.<br>
25Patent No. 6,218,371) purport to teach the co-administration of immunostimulatory<br>
CpG oligonucleotides and cytokines, particularly GM-CSF. Decker et al.<br>
{Experimental Hematology 28:558 565 (2000)), demonstrate that the co-adminstration<br>
of IL-2 with CpG oligonucleotides increases TNF- and IL-6 production in B-chronic<br>
lymphocytic (B-CLL) cells but not in normal B-cells.<br><br>
These reports make clear that there remains a need to be able to further<br>
optimize the therapeutic effectiveness of immunostimulatory oligonucleotides for the<br>
treatment of disease and enhance the anticancer activity of immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotides.<br><br>
BRIEF SI MMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention relates to optimized methods and compositions for enhancing<br>
the immune response caused by immunostimulatory compounds used in immune-<br>
based therapies. The optimized methods according to the invention result in synergy<br>
5between the therapeutic effect of immunostimulatory compounds such as<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and immunomer compounds and the therapeutic<br>
effect of cytokine immunotherapy and/or chemotherapeutic agents. The issued<br>
patents, patent applications, and references that are cited herein are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each was specifically and<br>
l0individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. In the event of inconsistencies<br>
between any teaching of any reference cited herein and the present specification, the<br>
latter shall prevail for purposes of the invention.<br>
The invention provides methods for enhancing the anti-cancer effect caused by<br>
immunostimulatory compounds used for immunotherapy applications for the<br>
I5treatment of cancer. In the method; according to the invention, immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotides and/or immunomer compounds provide a synergistic therapeutic<br>
effect when use in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. This result is<br>
surprising in view of the fact that ir imunostimulatory oligonucleotides and<br>
immunomer compounds cause cell division of immune system cells, whereas<br>
20chemotherapeutic agents normally kill actively dividing cells.<br>
In a first aspect, the inventic n provides a method for treating cancer in a cancer<br>
patient comprising administering, it. combination with chemotherapeutic agents,<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomer compounds, the latter<br>
comprising at least two oligonucleo ides linked together, such that the immunomer<br>
25compound has more than one accessible 5' end, wherein at least one of the<br>
oligonucleotides is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. As used herein, the term<br>
"accessible 5' end" means that the 5 end of the oligonucleotide is sufficiently<br>
available such that the factors that recognize and bind to immunomer compounds and<br>
stimulate the immune system have acess to it. Optionally, the 5' OH can be linked to<br>
30a phosphate, phosphorothioate, or p1 osphorodithioate moiety, an aromatic or aliphatic<br><br>
linker, cholesterol, or another emity which does not interfere with accessibility.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleot des and irnmunomer compounds induce an immune<br>
response when administered to a vertebrate. When used in combination with<br>
chemotherapeutic agents, a synergistie therapeutic effect is obtained.<br>

The immunomer compoum Is used in the method according to the invention<br>
comprise at least two oligonucleotides linked directly or via a non-nucleotidic linker.<br>
For purposes of the invention, a "n )n-nucleoi:idic linker" is any moiety that can be<br>
linked to the oligonucleotides by w ay of covalent or non-covalent linkages.<br>
lOPreferably such linker is from aboi t 2 angstroms to about 200 angstroms in length.<br><br>
Several examples of preferred linkers are set forth below. Non-covalent linkages<br>
include, but are not limited to, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interactions,<br>
-stacking interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The term "non-nucleotidic linker" is<br>
not meant to refer to an internuclcoside linkage, as described above, e.g., a<br>
5phosphodiester, phosphorothioatc, or phosphorodithioate functional group, that<br>
directly connects the 3'-hydroxyl groups of IAVO nucleosides. For purposes of this<br>
invention, such a direct 3'-3' linkage is considered to be a "nucleotidic linkage."<br>
In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a metal, including, without<br>
limitation, gold particles. In somt other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a<br>
l0soluble or insoluble biodegradable polymer bead.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is an organic moiety<br>
having functional groups that permit attachment to the oligonucleotide. Such<br>
attachment preferably is by any stable covalent linkage.<br>
In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a biomolecule, including,<br>
15without limitation, polypeptides, antibodies, lipids, antigens, allergens, and<br>
oligosaccharides. In some other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a small<br>
molecule. For purposes of the invention, a small molecule is an organic moiety<br>
having a molecular weight of less han 1,000 Da. In some embodiments, the small<br>
molecule has a molecular weight of less than 750 Da.<br>
20	In some embodiments, the small molecule is an aliphatic or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon, either of which optionally can include, either in the linear chain<br>
connecting the oligonucleotides or appended to it, one or more functional groups<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, amino, thiol, thioether, ether, amide,<br>
thioamide, ester, urea, and thiourea. The small molecule can be cyclic or acyclic.<br>
25Examples of small molecule linkers include, but are not limited to, amino acids,<br>
carbohydrates, cyclodextrins, adamantane, cholesterol, haptens and antibiotics.<br>
However, for purposes of describir g the non-nucleotidic linker, the term "small<br>
molecule" is not intended to include a nucleoside.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the small molecule linker is glycerol or a glycerol<br>
homolog of the formula HO-(CH))-CH(OH)-(CH2)P-OH, wherein o andp<br>
independently are integers from 1 to about 6, from 1 to about 4, or from 1 to about 3.<br>
In some other embodiments, the small molecule linker is a derivative of 1,3-diamino-<br>
52-hydroxypropane. Some such derivatives have the formula HO-(CH2)m-C(O)<br>
NH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-NHC(O)- (CH2)m-OH, wherein m is an integer from 0 to about<br>
10, from 0 to about 6, from 2 to about 6, or from 2 to about 4.<br>
Some non-nucleotidic linkers in immunomer compounds used in the method<br>
according to the invention permit attachment of more than two oligonucleotides, as<br>
l0schematically depicted in Figure 1 For example, the small molecule linker glycerol<br>
has three hydroxyl groups to which oligonucleotides may be covalently attached.<br>
Some immunomer compounds according to the invention, therefore, comprise more<br>
than two oligonucleotides linked at their 3' ends to a non-nucleotidic linker. Some<br>
such immunomer compounds comprise at least two immunostimulatory<br>
15oligonucleotides, each having an accessible 5' end.<br>
The immunostimulatory ol gonucleotides and/or immunomer compounds used<br>
m the method according to the invention may conveniently be synthesized using an<br>
automated synthesizer and phosphoramidite approach as schematically depicted in<br>
Figures 5 and 6, and further described in the Examples. In some embodiments, the<br>
20immunostimulatory oligonucleotidss and/or immunomer compounds are synthesized<br>
by a linear synthesis approach (see Figure 5). As used herein, the term "linear<br>
synthesis" refers to a synthesis that starts at one end of the immunomer compound and<br>
progresses linearly to the other end. Linear synthesis permits incorporation of either<br>
identical or un-identical (in terms of length, base composition and/or chemical<br>
25modifications incorporated) monomeric units into the immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotides and/or immunomcr compounds.<br>
An alternative mode of syn hesis for immunomer compounds is "parallel<br>
synthesis", in which synthesis proceeds outward from a central linker moiety (see<br>
Figure 6). A solid support attachec. linker can be used for parallel synthesis, as is<br><br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,912 332. Alternatively, a universal solid support, such<br>
as phosphate attached to controlled pore glass support, can be used.<br>
Parallel synthesis of immunomer compounds has several advantages over<br>
linear synthesis: (1) parallel synthesis permits the incorporation of identical<br>
5monomeric units; (2) unlike in liner synthesis, both (or all) the monomeric units are<br>
synthesized at the same time, thereoy the number of synthetic steps and the time<br>
required for the synthesis is the same as that of a monomeric unit; and (3) the<br>
reduction in synthetic steps improves purity and yield of the final immunomer<br>
product.<br>
10	At the end of the synthesis by either linear synthesis or parallel synthesis<br>
protocols, the immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or immunomer compounds used in<br>
the method according to the invent on may conveniently be deprotected with<br>
concentrated ammonia solution or is recommended by the phosphoramidite supplier,<br>
if a modified nucleoside is incorpo "ated. The product immunostimulatory<br>
15oligonucleotides and/or immunomor compound is preferably purified by reversed<br>
dose HPLC, detritylated, desalted and dialyzed.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides suitable for use as a component of an<br>
immunomer compound, or in acco dance with the fourth aspect of the invention , are<br>

phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, and phosphorodithioate. In certain preferred<br>
embodiments, the immunostin ulatory dinucleotide is not CpG. In some<br>
embodiments, Domain B is pnferably a non-nucloetidic linker connecting<br>
25oligonucleotides of Domain A and Domain C, which are referred to as<br>
"immunomers." In certain preferred embodiments, Domain C does not have the<br>
dinucleotide CpG, C*pG, C*pG* or CpG*.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, in certain embodiments of this aspect the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid will have a structure as detailed in formula (II).<br><br><br>
The structure depicted in formula (III) is referred to herein as a "terminal dimmer,"<br>
l0since the ends of the two molecules are blocked because the sequences of the two<br>
ends are complementary allowing for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In addition,<br>
domains A and A' may or may not be identical, domains B and B' may or may not be<br>
identical and domains C and C may or may not be identical.<br>
By way of non-limiting e cample, in certain embodiments of this aspect the<br>
15immunostimulatory nucleic acid will have a structure as detailed in formula (IV).<br><br><br>
As would be recognized by one skilled in the art, the terminal end of the<br>
depicted molecule has a secondary structure because the complementary sequence of<br>
its end is hydrogen bonded to this region. In certain embodiments, a molecule such as<br>
5a ligand may be attached to the terminal end in order to facilitate cellular uptake or<br>
improve stability of the moleculr.<br>

40	Another aspect of the invention provides an immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
wherein the sequence of the immutiostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer is<br>
at least partially self-complementaiy. A self-complementary sequence as used herein<br>
refers to a base sequence which, upon suitable alignment, may form intramolecular or,<br>
more typically, intermolecular basepairing between G-C, A-T, A-U and/or G-U<br>
45wobble pairs. In one embodiment he extent of self-complementarity is at least 50<br>
percent. For example an 8-mer that is at least 50 percent self-complementary may<br>
have a sequence capable of forming 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 G-C, A-T, A-U and/or G-U wobble<br>
basepairs. Such basepairs may but need not necessarily involve bases located at either<br>
end of the self-complementary immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or<br>
50immunomer. Where nucleic acid stabilization may be important to the<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotids and/or immunomer, it may be advantageous to<br>
"clamp" together one or both ends of a double-stranded nucleic acid, either by<br>
basepairing or by any other suitablâ€¢; means. The degree of self-complementarity may<br>
depend on the alignment between immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or<br>
55 immunomer, and such alignment may or may not include single- or multiple-<br>
nucleoside overhangs. In other embodiments, the degree of self-complementarity is at<br><br>
least 60 percent, at least 70 percent, at least 30 percent, at least 90 percent, or even<br>
100 percent.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, in certain embodiments of this aspect the<br>
irnmunostimulatory nucleic acid will have a structure as detailed in formula (V)<br>

As would be recognized by one sk lled in the art, the depicted immunomer<br>
compounds have secondary structure because the sequences of the domains are<br>
complementary allowing for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Domains A and A'<br>
l0may or may not be identical, domains A and C may or may not be identical, domains<br>
A and C may or may not be identical, domains A and C may or may not be identical,<br>
domains A and C may or may noi be identical, domains B and B' may or may not be<br>
identical and domains C and C may or may not be identical. Moreover, additional<br>
immunomers can bind through intrmolecular hydrogen bonding thereby creating a<br>
15chain, or multimers, of immunomers according to the invention, n can be any number<br>
of continuous self complementary immunomer compounds.<br>
As used herein, the term "complementary" means having the ability to<br>
hybridize to a nucleic acid. Such hybridization is ordinarily the result of hydrogen<br>
bonding between complementary strands, preferably to form Watson-Crick or<br>
20Hoogsteen base pairs, although other modes of hydrogen bonding, as well as base<br>
stacking can also lead to hybridiza ion.<br>
As used herein, the term "secondary structure" refers to intermolecular<br>
hydrogen bonding. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding results in the formation of a<br>
duplexed nucleic acid molecule.<br>

15	In a second aspect, the inv ention provides a method for treating cancer in a<br>
cancer patient comprising administering to the patient a chemotherapeutic agent in<br>
combination with an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer<br>
conjugate, which comprises an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or<br>
immunomer compound, as described above, and an antigen conjugated to the<br>
20immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer compound at a position other<br>
than the accessible 5' end. In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker<br>
comprises an antigen associated with cancer, which is conjugated to the<br>
oligonucleotide. In some other embodiments, the antigen is conjugated to the<br>
oligonucleotide at a position other than its 3' end. In some embodiments, the antigen<br>
25produces a vaccine effect. For put poses of the invention, the term "associated with"<br>
means that the antigen is present vhen the cancer, is present, but either is not present,<br>
or is present in reduced amounts, when the cancer is absent.<br>
The immunostimulatory ohgonucleotides and/or immunomer compound is<br>
covalently linked to the antigen, OR it is otherwise operatively associated with the<br>
30antigen. As used herein, the term 'operatively associated with" refers to any<br><br>
association that maintains the activity of both immunostimulatory oligonucleotide<br>
and/or immunomer compound and antigen. Nonlimiting examples of such operative<br>
associations include being part of the same liposome or other such delivery vehicle or<br>
reagent. Additionally, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the antigen can be cloned<br>
5into an expression vector and administered in combination with the<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer compound. As used herein,<br>
the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another<br>
nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Preferred vectors are those capable of<br>
autonomous replication and expression of nucleic acids to which they are linked (e.g.,<br>
l0an episome). Vectors capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are<br>
operatively linked are referred to herein as "expression vectors." In general,<br>
expression vectors of utility in recoombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of<br>
"plasmids" which refer generally :o circular double stranded DNA loops which, in<br>
their vector form, are not bound to the chromosome. In the present specification,<br>
15"plasmid" and "vector" are used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly<br>
used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms<br>
of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which become known in<br>
the art subsequently hereto.<br>
In embodiments wherein the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or<br>
20immunomer compound is covalently linked to the antigen, such covalent linkage<br>
preferably is at any position on the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or<br>
immunomer compound other than an accessible 5' end of an immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotide. For example, the antigen may be attached at an internucleoside<br>
linkage or may be attached to the non-nucleotidic linker. Alternatively, the antigen<br>
25may itself be the non-nucleotidic 1 nker.<br>
In a third aspect, the invem ion provides pharmaceutical formulations<br>
comprising an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotide conjugate and/or inmunomer compound or immunomer conjugate<br>
according to the invention, a chemotherapeutic agent and a physiologically acceptable<br>
30carrier. As used herein, the term " ohysiologically acceptable" refers to a material that<br><br>
does not interfere with the effec iveness of the immunomer compound and is<br>
compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism.<br>

In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for treating cancer in a<br>
cancer patient comprising adminis ering to the patient a monoclonal antibody ia<br>
20combination with an immunostimi latory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer<br>
compound, as described herein. Passive immunotherapy in the form of antibodies,<br>
and particularly monoclonal antibodies, has been the subject of considerable research<br>
and development as anti-cancer agents. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used<br>
herein refers to an antibody molecile of single molecular composition. A monoclonal<br>
25antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular<br>
epitope. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to antibodies<br>
displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions<br>
derived from human germline imm moglobulin sequences. Examples of anti-cancer<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, Panorex (Glaxo-Welcome), Rituxan<br>
30(IDEC/Genentech/Hoffman la Rod e), Mylotarg (Wyeth), Campath (Millennium),<br><br>
Zevalin (IDEC and Schering AG;, Bexxar (Corixa/GSK), Erbitux (Imclone/BMS),<br>
Avastin (Genentech) and Herceplin (Genentech/Hoffman la Roche). Antibodies may<br>
also be employed in active immunotherapy utilising anti-idiotype antibodies which<br>
appear to mimic (in an immunological sense) cancer antigens. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
5can be generated by methods known to those skilled in the art of recombinant DNA<br>
technology.<br>
As used herein, the term "carrier" encompasses any excipient, diluent, filler,<br>
salt, buffer, stabilizer, solubilizer, lipid, or other material well known in the art for use<br>
in pharmaceutical formulations. I: will be understood that the characteristics of the<br>
lOcarrier, excipient, or diluent will depend on the route of administration for a particular<br>
application. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable formulations containing<br>
these materials is described in, e.g , Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990.<br>
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as sensors of infection and induce the<br>
15activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. TLRs recognize a wide variety<br>
of iligands, called pathogen-associa ted molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon<br>
recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular products, TLRs activate host<br>
defense responses through their intracellular signalling domain, the Toll/interleukin-1<br>
receptor (TIR) domain, and the downstream adaptor protein MyD88. Dendritic cells<br>
20and macrophages normally respond to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and cytokines<br>
(for example, interleukin-1 Î²; IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor, TNF), which they also<br>
produce; natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are also involved. After TLR<br>
stimulation by bacterial compound;, innate immune cells release a range of cytokines.<br>
Some examples of TLR ligands include, but are not limited to, lipoproteins;<br>
25peptidoglycan, zymosan (TLR2), double-stranded RNA, polyI:polyC (TLR3),<br>
lipopolysaccharide, heat shock proteins, taxo) (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), and<br>
imidazoquinolines- R848, resiquitnod, uniquimod; ssRNA (TLR7/8).<br>
In a fourth aspect, the inver tion provides a method for sensitizing cancer cells<br>
to ionizing radiation. The method according to this aspect of the invention comprises<br>
30administering to a mammal an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide or an immunomer<br><br>
compound according to the invention and treating the animal with ionizing radiation.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, â€¢-Irradiation is administered at 1.56 Gy/min. In<br>
certain preferred embodiments, adiation therapy is administered from about 0.1 to<br>
about 10.0 Gy, preferably from about 0.25 to about 8.0 Gy, more preferably from<br>
5about 0.5 to about 5.0 Gy, or as 3.0 Gy of radiation either twice for one week, four<br>
times for one week, or three time s on Days 2, 4, and 9. In certain embodiments pre-<br>
treatment with an immunostimuktory oligonucleotide or an immunomer compound is<br>
from about 2 to about 6 h prior to â€¢ -irradiation.<br>
In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a method for synergistically<br>
l0stimuIating an immune response in a patient comprising administering to a patient a<br>
therapeutically effective synergist c amount of an immunomer compound in<br>
combination with a therapeutically effective synergistic amount of IL-2, and an<br>
antigen, wherein administration o "said combination synergistically stimulates the<br>
production of cytokines in a patient Preferred cytokines stimulated in accordance<br>
15with the invention include but are not limited to one or more of, IL-12, interferon-* ,<br>
IFN-* and IFN-Î².<br>
In certain embodiments, the method is for the treatment of cancer and the<br>
antigen is one specific to or associated with a cancer. In some embodiments, the<br>
method is for the treatment of an i itection and the antigen is an antigen associated<br>
20with the infection. In certain embodiments, the method is for the treatment of an<br>
allergy and the antigen is associated with the allergy. As used herein, the term<br>
"associated with" means that the antigen is present when the cancer, allergen or<br>
infectious disease is present, but e ther is not present, or is present in reduced<br>
amounts, when the cancer, allergen or infectious disease is absent.<br>
25	As used herein, the term "antigen" means a substance that is recognized and<br>
bound specifically by an antibody or by a T cell antigen receptor. Antigens can<br>
include peptides, proteins, glycopioteins, polysaccharides, gangliosides and lipids;<br>
portions thereof and combinations thereof. The antigens can be those found in nature<br>
or can be synthetic. Haptens are included within the scope of "antigen." A hapten is a<br>
301ow molecular weight compound taat is not immunogenie by itself but is rendered<br><br>
immunogenic when conjugated with an immunogenic molecule containing antigenic<br>
determinants.<br>
In certain embodiments, antigens useful in methods and compositions of the<br>
invention are tumor-associated and/or tumor-specific antigens. Non-limiting<br>
5examples include: Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase<br>
(PAP), which are markers normal y present in the blood in small amounts that can be<br>
elevated in the presence of prostate cancer; Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125), which is at<br>
elevated levels in patients with ovarian cancer and is sometimes elevated in the<br>
presence of other cancers; CA 15-3 and CA 27-29, which are useful in following the<br>
lOcourse of breast cancer and its response to treatment; CA 19-9, which is commonly<br>
used as a check for the spread of pancreatic cancer and is also elevated in patients<br>
with colorectal, stomach and bile duct cancer; Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA),<br>
which is normally present in small amounts but can be elevated in the blood of<br>
patients with a wide variety of cancers; Alpha-Fetoprotein, which is a marker for<br>
15hepatocellular and germ cell (nonseminoma) carcinoma; and Galactosyl Transferase<br>
II, an isozyme of galactosyl trans ft rase, that has been shown to be elevated in a variety<br>
of malignancies, predominantly gastrointestinal. As known by one skilled in the art,<br>
tumor-associated and tumor-specific antigens are available commercially. Also<br>
contemplated by the invention are those antigens that can be made by recombinant<br>
20nucleic acid technologies and/or symthetic antigens, e.g., peptides produced by<br>
methods known in the art.<br>
In certain embodiments of he fifth aspect of the invention, the invention<br>
provides a method for treating canoer in a cancer patient comprising administering to<br>
the patient a therapeutically effective synergistic amount of 1L-2 in combination with<br>
25an immunomer conjugate, which comprises an immunomer compound, as described<br>
above, and an antigen. In certain embodiments, the antigen is conjugated to the<br>
immunomer compound at a position other than the accessible 5' end. In some<br>
embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker of the immunomer compound comprises an<br>
antigen associated with cancer. In some embodiments, the antigen is conjugated to<br>
30the immunomer compound at a po iition other than its 5' end. In some embodiments,<br><br>
the antigen produces a vaccine effect. For purposes of the invention, the term<br>
"associated with" means that the antigen is present when the cancer is present, but<br>
either is not present, or is present n reduced amounts, when the cancer is absent.<br>
In some embodiments of the fifth aspect of the invention, the immunomer<br>
5compound is covalently linked to the antigen, or it is otherwise operatively associated<br>
with the antigen. As used herein, the term "operatively associated with" refers to any<br>
association that maintains the activity of the immunomer compound and antigen.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of such operative associations include being part of the same<br>
liposome or other such delivery vaiicle or reagent. In embodiments wherein the<br>
l0immunomer compound is covalent y linked to the antigen, such covalent linkage<br>
preferably is at any position on the immunomer compound other than at an accessible<br>
5' end of the immunomer compound. For example, the antigen may be attached at an<br>
internucleoside linkage or may be attached to the non-nucleotidic linker.<br>
Alternatively, the antigen may itself be the non-nucleotidic linker.<br>
15	In a sixth aspect of the invention, at least one immunostimulatory<br>
oliconucleotide that is not an immunomer compound is used in combination with a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of IL-2 to selectively and synergistically stimulate the<br>
production of cytokines in a patient Preferred cytokines synergistically stimulated in<br>
accordance with the invention are s ilected from the group consisting of, IL-12 and<br>
20IFN-* ,IFN-Â» ,IFN-Î² or combinations thereof. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, preferred immunostimulatory oligonucleotides that are not immunomer<br>
compounds include those containingat least one immunostimulatory CpG<br>
dinucleotide wherein C is not cytos ne or deoxycytosine and/or G is not guanosine or<br>
2-deoxyguanosine. Other preferred immunosumulatory oligonucleotides of the<br>
25invention that are not immunomer c ompounds are those that include alternative<br>
immunostimulatory moieties that are not CpG. Examples of such alternative<br>
immunostimulatory moieties include but are not limited to nucleosides comprising<br>
non-naturally occurring bases and/or sugar and secondary structures of the<br>
oligonucleotide itself such as hairpi in structures that stabilize the oligonucleotide, as<br>
30described in the following U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications and are<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Patent Numbers 6,426,334 and 6,476,000; and<br>

In certain embodiments of the invention, each of the immunomer compound or<br>
5immunostimulatory oligonucleotice and IL-2 is admixed with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier prior to administration to the patient. In certain embodiments, the<br>
immunomer compound or immune stimulatory oligonucleotide are mixed together<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to administration, or combined as part<br>
of a pharmaceutical composition as, described in the fourth aspect of the invention. As<br>
lOused herein, the term "carrier" encompasses any excipient, diluent, filler, salt, buffer,<br>
stabilizer, solubilizer, lipid, or other material well known in the art for use in<br>
pharmaceutical formulations. It will be understood that the characteristics of the<br>
carrier, excipient, or diluent will depend on the route of administration for a particular<br>
application. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable formulations containing<br>
I5these materials is described in, e.g.. Remington: The Science and Practice of<br>
Pharmacy, 20* Edition, ed. A. L. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Publishing<br>

In a seventh aspect, the invention provides therapeutic compositions<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acce ptable carrier, a therapeutically effective<br>
20synergistic amount of an immunomsr compound or immunostimulotory<br>
oligonucleotide, a therapeutically effective synergistic amount of IL-2 and optionally,<br>
an antigen, wherein administration of said therapeutic composition synergistically<br>
stimulates the production of cytokines in a patient. Preferred cytokines that are<br>
synergistically stimulated in accord mce with the invention are selected from the<br>
25group consisting of IL-12 and interieron-* ,IFN-Â» ,IFN-Î² or combinations thereof.<br>
AH aspects of the invention are useful in the treatment of disease, and are<br>
particularly useful in immune-based therapies for treating cancer, infectious diseases<br>
and allergies. As used herein the tern "treating" or "treatment" of disease includes:<br>
prevention of disease; dimunition o â€¢ eradication of signs or symptoms of disease after<br>
30onset; and prevention of relapse of disease.<br><br>
In the methods according 10 the invention, administration of an immunomer<br>
compound or immmumostimulatcry oligonucleotide in combination with IL-2 can be<br>
by any suitable route including, w thout limitation, parenteral, oral, sublingual,<br>
transdermal, topical, intranasal, aerosol, intraocular, intratracheal, intrarectal, vaginal,<br>
5by gene gun, dermal patch or in eye drop or mouthwash form. Administration of<br>
immunomer compounds, immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, IL-2 or therapeutic<br>
compositions thereof can be carried out using known procedures using therapeutically<br>
effective synergistic amounts and for periods of time effective to treat disease.<br>
The term "in combination with" means in the course of treating the same<br>
lOdisease in the same patient, and includes administering the immunomer compound<br>
and /or immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or IL-2 in any order, including<br>
simultaneous administration, as well as temporally spaced order of up to several days<br>
apart. Such combination treatment may also include more than a single<br>
administration of the immunomer compound and /or immunostimulatory<br>
15oligonucleotide, and/or IL-2, independently. The administration of the immunomer<br>
compound and IL-2 may be by the same or different routes.<br>
One of skill in the art will aopreciate that such synergistic effect of either the<br>
immunomer compound or immunostimulator/ oligonucleotide, IL-2 or both may vary<br>
considerably depending on the tissie, organ, the particular disease or the patient to be<br>
20treated in accordance with the invention. Furthermore, one of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that the therapeutically effective synergistic amount of either the<br>
immunomer compound or immunostimulatory oligonucleotide or IL-2 may be<br>
lowered or increased by fine tuning and altering the amount of the other component.<br>
When administered systemioally, the immunomer compound is preferably<br>
25administered at a sufficient dosage :o attain a blood level of immunomer compound<br>
from about 0.0001 micromolar to about 10 micromolar. For localized administration,<br>
much lower concentrations than this may be effective, and much higher<br>
concentrations may be tolerated. Preferably, a total dosage of immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotide and/or immunomer compound ranges from about 0.0001 mg per<br>
30patient per day to about 200 mg per kg body weight per day. It may be desirable to<br><br>
administer simultaneously, or seq .lentially, a therapeutically effective synergistic<br>
amount of each of the immunomer compound or IL-2 to an individual as a single<br>
treatment episode. Preferably, IL- 2 is administered in an amount of about 750 to<br>
about 75,000 units.<br>

The invention provides a kit comprising a cytokine and.or chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, and immunostimulatory olgonucleotides and/or immunomer compounds, the<br>
latter comprising at least two oligonucleotides linked together, such that the<br>
immunomer compound has more than one accessible 5' end, wherein at least one of<br>
l0the oligonucleotides is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. In another aspect, the<br>
kit comprises an immunostimulato y oligonucleotide and/or immunostimulatory<br>
oligonucleotide conjugate and/or inmunomer compound or immunomer conjugate<br>
according to the invention, a cytokine and/or chemotherapeutic agent and a<br>
physiologically acceptable carrier. The kit will generally also include a set of<br>
15instructions for use.<br><br>
The examples below are intended to farther illustrate certain preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention,<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of Oligcnucleotides Containing Immunomodulatory<br>
5 Moieties<br>
Oligonucleotides were syn :hesized on a 1 Î¼mol scale using an automated<br>
DNA synthesizer (Expedite 8909; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA),<br>
following the linear synthesis or parallel synthesis procedures outlined in Figures 5<br>
and 6.<br>
10	Deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidites were obtained from Applied<br>
Biosystems (Foster City, CA). 1 ;2:'-dideoxyribose phosphoramidite, propyl-1-<br>
phosphoramidite, 2-deoxyuridine phosphoramidite, l,3-bis-[5-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)<br>
pentylamidyl]-2-propanol phospho -amidite and methyl phosponamidite were obtained<br>
from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). -L-2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidite, -<br>
152'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidite, mono-DMT-glycerol phosphoramidite and<br>
di-DMT-glycerol phosphoramidite were obtained from ChemGenes (Ashland, MA).<br>
(4-Aminobutyl)-l,3-propanediol p\ osphoramidite was obtained from Clontech (Palo<br>
Alto, CA). Arabinocytidine phosphoramidite, arabinoguanosine, arabinothymidine<br>
and arabinouridine were obtained from Reliable Pharmaceutical (St. Louis, MO).<br>
20Arabinoguanosine phosphoramiditt, arabinothymidine phosphoramidite and<br>
arabinouridine phosphoramidite were synthesized at Hybridon, Inc. (Cambridge, MA)<br>
(Noronha et al. (2000) Biochem., 39: 7050-7062).<br>
All nucleoside phosphoramidites were characterized by 31P and !H NMR<br>
spectra. Modified nucleosides were incorporated at specific sites using normal<br>
25coupling cycles. After synthesis, oligonucleotides were deprotected using<br>
concentrated ammonium hydroxide and purified by reverse phase HPLC, followed by<br>
dialysis. Purified oligonucleotides is sodium salt form were lyophilized prior to use.<br>
Purity was tested by CGE and MAI DI-TOF MS.<br><br>
Example 2: Analysis of Spleen Cell Proliferation<br>
In vitro analysis of splenoeyte proliferation was carried out using standard<br>
procedures as described previousl / (see, e.g., Zhao et al., Biochem Pharma 51 .173-<br>
182 (1996)). The results are shown in Figure 8A. These results demonstrate that at<br>
5the higher concentrations, Immunomer 6, having two accessible 5' ends results in<br>
greater splenocyte proliferation than does Immunomer 5, having no accessible 5' end<br>
or Oligonucleotide 4, with a single accessible 5' end. Immunomer 6 also causes<br>
greater splenocyte proliferation then the LPS positive control.<br>
Example 3: In vivo Splenomegaly Assays<br>
10	To test the applicability of the in vitro results to an in vivo model, selected<br>
oligonucleotides were administered to mice and the degree of splenomegaly was<br>
measured as an indicator of the level of immunostimulatory activity. A single dose of<br>
5 mg/kg was administered to BALB/c mice (female, 4-6 weeks old, Harlan Sprague<br>
Dawley Inc, Baltic, CT) intraperito leally. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours after<br>
15oligonucleotide administration, and spleens were harvested and weighed. The results<br>
are shown in Figure 8B. These results demonstrate that Immunomer 6, having two<br>
accessible 5' ends, has a far greater immunostimulatory effect than do Oligonucleotide<br>
4 or Immunomer 5.<br>
Example 4: Cytokine Analysis<br>
20	The secretion of IL-12 and 1L-6 in vertebrate cells, preferably BALB/c mouse<br>
spleen cells or human PBMC, was measured by sandwich ELISA. The required<br>
reagents including cytokine antibodies and cytokine standards were purchased form<br>
PharMingen, San Diego, CA. ELISA plates (Costar) were incubated with appropriate<br>
antibodies at 5 g/mL in PBSN buffer (PBS/0.05% sodium azide, pH 9.6) overnight<br>
25at 4Â°C and then blocked with PBS/1% BSA at 37 Â°C for 30 minutes. Cell culture<br>
supernatants and cytokine standards were appropriately diluted with PBS/10% FBS,<br>
added to the plates in triplicate, and incubated at 25 Â°C for 2 hours. Plates were<br>
overlaid with 1 g/mL appropriate biotinylated antibody and incubated at 25 Â°C for<br>
1.5 hours. The plates were then washed extensively with PBS-T Buffer (PBS/0.05%<br><br>
Tween 20) and further incubated at 25 Â°C for 1.5 hours after adding streptavidin<br>
conjugated peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The plates were developed with Sure<br>
Blueâ„¢ (Kirkegaard and Perry) chromogenic reagent and the reaction was terminated<br>
by adding Stop Solution (Kirkega* rd and Perry). The color change was measured on a<br>
SCeres 900 HDI Spectrophotometei (Bio-Tek Instruments). The results are shown in<br>
Table 5 A below.<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from<br>
peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation<br>
(Histopaque-1077, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, heparinized blood was layered<br>
lOonto the Histopaque-1077 (equal volume) in a conical centrifuge and centrifuged at<br>
400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature. The buffy coat, containing the<br>
mononuclear cells, was removed carefully and washed twice with isotonic phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 minutes. The resulting cell<br>
pellet was then resuspended in RPM1 1640 medium containing L-glutamine<br>
15(MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, VA) ar d supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS<br>
and penicillin-streptomycin (100U/nl). Cells were cultured in 24 well plates for<br>
different time periods at 1 X 106 eells/ml/well in the presence or absence of<br>
oligonucleotides. At the end of the mcubation period, supernatants were harvested and<br>
stored frozen at -70 â€¢ Cuntil assayed for various cytokines including IL-6 (BD<br>
20Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), IL-K (BD Pharmingen), 1L-12 (BioSource<br>
International, Camarillo, CA), IFN- (BioSource International) and - (BD<br>
Pharmingen) and TNF- (BD Phamingen) by sandwich ELISA. The results are<br>
shown in Tables 9 and 9A below.<br>
In all instances, the levels ol IL-12 and IL-6 in the cell culture supematants<br>
25were calculated from the standard cirve constructed under the same experimental<br>
conditions for IL-12 and IL-6, respectively. The levels of IL-10, IFN-gamma and<br>
TNF-* in the cell culture supernatar is were calculated from the standard curve<br>
constructed under the same experimental conditions for IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-<br>
â€¢ Respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 5: Immunostimulatory Activity of Immunomer Compounds<br>
Containing A Non-Natural Pyrimidine or Non-Natural Purine Nucleoside<br>
As shown in Tables 10-12 immunostimulatory activity was maintained for<br>
immunomer compounds of various lengths having a non-natural pyrimidine<br>
5nucleoside or non-natural purine nucleoside in the immunostimulatory dinucleotide<br>
motif.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 6: Effect of the Linker on Immunostimulatory Activity<br>
In order to examine the effect of the length of the linker connecting the two<br>
5oligonucleotides, immunomer compaunds that contained the same oligonucleotides,<br>
but different linkers were synthesized and tested for immunostimulatory activity. The<br>
results shown in Table 13 suggest that: linker length plays a role in the<br>
immunostimulatory activity of immunomer compounds. The best immunostimulatory<br>
effect was achieved with C3- to C6-ilkyl linkers or abasic linkers having interspersed<br>
Is sphate charges.<br><br><br><br>
oligonucleotides with a phosphorc thioate backbones. This lower degree of<br>
immunostimulatory activity could be due in part to the rapid degradation of<br>
phosphodiester oligonucleotides under experimental conditions. Degradation of<br>
oligonucleotides is primarily the result of 3'-exonucleases, which digest the<br>
5oligonucleotides from the 3' end. The immunomer compounds of this example do not<br>
contain a free 3' end. Thus, immunomer compounds with phosphodiester backbones<br>
should have a longer half life under experimental conditions than the corresponding<br>
monomeric oligonucleotides, and thould therefore exhibit improved<br>
immunostimulatory activity. The resuits presented in Table 14 demonstrate this<br>
l0effect, with Immunomers 84 and 85 exhibiting immunostimulatory activity as<br>
determined by cytokine induction in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures.<br>

15Example 8: In vivo anti-cancer activity of immunomer compounds in<br>
combination with chemotherapentic agents<br>
PC3 cells were cultured in )()% Ham s, F12K Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine<br>
Serum (FBS), in presence of 100 I /ml Penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml Streptomycin to<br>
establish the Human Prostate cancer model (PC3). Male athymic nude mice, 4-6<br>
20weeks old (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD),<br>
were accommodated for 6 days for environmental adjustment prior to the study.<br>
Cultured PC3 cells were harvested from the monolayer cultures, washed twice with<br>
Ham's, F12K Medium (10% FBS) resuspended in FBS-free Ham's, F12K Medium:<br>
Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA)<br>
25(5:1; V/V), and injected subcutaneously (5 X 106 cells, total volume 0.2 ml) into the<br><br>
left inguinal area of each of the miee. The animals were monitored by general clinical<br>
observation, body weight, and turror growth. Tumor growth was monitored by the<br>
measurement, with calipers, of two perpendicular diameters of the implant. Tumor<br>
mass (weight in grams) was calculated by the formula, l/2a X b2, where 'a' is the long<br>
5diameter (cm) and 'b' is the short diameter (cm). When the mean tumor sizes reached<br>
~80mg, the animals bearing human cancer xenografts were randomly divided into the<br>
treatment and control groups (5 an mals/group). The control group received sterile<br>
physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) c nly. Immunomers 26 or 194, aseptically dissolved<br>
in physiological saline, was administered by subcutaneously injection at dose of 0.5 or<br>
101.0 mg/kg/day, 3 doses/week. Gemcitabine HC1 (Eli Lilly and Company,<br>
Indianapolis, IN) was given twice by intraperitoneal injection at 160 mg/kg on Day 0<br>
and 3. The detailed treatment schedule is shown as follows.<br>
Gl:	Saline<br>
G2:	Gemcitabint (160 mg/kg/day, IP, Day 0 and 3)<br>
15	G3:	26 (1.0 mg/l g/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks)<br>
G4:	26 (0.5 mg/lg/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks)<br>
G5:	194 (1.0 mg, kg/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks)<br>
G6:	194 (0.5 mg, kg/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks)<br>
G7:	26 (0.5 mg/l g/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks) +<br>
20	Gemcitabine (160 mg/kg/day, Day 0 and 3)<br>
G8:	194 (0.5 mg kg/day, SC, 3 doses /week, for 6 weeks) +<br>
Gemcitabint (160 mg/kg/day, Day 0 and 3)<br>
The tumor measurements ifter various treatments are presented in Table 15<br>
and Figure 13. The tumor growth in all Immunomer 26 and 194 treated animals was<br>
25remarkably inhibited compared with saline control (p
dose-response relationship in these treatment groups (Fig. 13). There was no<br>
significant difference between 26 and 194 (Table 15).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The body weight measurer lents after treatments at various times are presented<br>
in Table 16 and Figure 14. There was no significant difference in body weight gains<br>
among 26 or 194 alone compared .with controls. Gemcitabine treated animals had<br>
body weight loss in the first week and recovered in a week afterwards. Combination<br>
5with 26 or 194 did not change the side effect profiles of Gemcitabine. No other<br>
clinical abnormality or death was observed in all the groups.<br><br>
In summary, 26 and 194significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice<br>
bearing human prostate cancer PC3 xenografts with no significant side effects. When<br>
26 or 194 was given in combination with Gemcitabine, each compound significantly<br>
15increased the therapeutic effect of Gemcitabine without changes in side effect profiles,<br>
hi addition, there was a tendency in dose dependent response of 26 or 194 treatment.<br>
Example 9 In vivo anti-cancer activity of immunomer compounds in combination<br>
with chemotherapeutic agents<br><br>
The experiment of Example 8 was repeated using taxotere instead of<br>
Gemcitabine. Taxotere was administered on days 0 and 7. 165 was administered 5<br>
days per week. 26 and 194 were administered on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11. The results<br>
are shown in Table 17 below. These results clearly demonstrate synergy between the<br>
5immunomer compounds and taxotere.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10 Administration of Immunostimulatory Oligonucleotides and IL-2<br>
Splenocytes were isolated rom BALB/c mice as described above and were<br>
plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 5x10(' cells/mL. CpG oligonucleotides were<br>
dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tns-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) was added to a final<br>
5concentration of 0.03,0.1,0.3,1.0 3.0, or 10.0 Î¼g/mL to mouse spleen cell cultures.<br>
In order to study the role of IL-2 in CpG oligonucleotide-induced time-dependent<br>
cytokine secretion, recombinant human IL-2 (Sigma) was added at a concentration of<br>
10 U/ml at the start of the experiment. The cells were then incubated at 37. Cfor 4, 8,<br>
24 and 48 h in the presence of test oligonucleotides and the supernatants were<br>
lOcollected for ELISA assays. Untre ited cells (only IL-2 addition) were taken as<br>
controls.<br>
The secretion of mouse IL-12, IL-6 and IFN-* was measured by sandwich<br>
ELISA. The required regents, including cytokine antibodies and standards were<br>
purchases from PharMingen. ELIS A plates (Costar) were incubated with appropriate<br>
IScapture antibodies in PBSN (PBS/O.05% sodium azide, pH 9,6) buffer overnight at<br>
4- Cand then blocked with PBS/10/. BSA at 37. Cfor 30 min. Cell culture<br>
supernatants and cytokine standards were appropriately diluted with PBS/1% BSA,<br>
added to the plates in triplicate, and incubated at 25* Cfor 2 h. Plates were washed<br>
and incubated with the appropriate biotiaylated antibody and incubated at 25. Cfor 1.5<br>
20h. The plates were washed extensi rely with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and then further<br>
incubated at 25. Cfor 1.5 h. after addition of streptavidine-conjugated peroxidase<br>
(Sigma). Plates were developed w th Sure Blueâ„¢ (Kirkegaard and Perry)<br>
chromogenic reagent and the reaction was terminated by adding Stop Solution<br>
(Kirkegaard and Perry). The color change was measured on a Ceres 900 HDI<br>
25Spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments) at 450nm. The levels of IL-12, IL6 and<br>
IFN-* in the cell culture supernatants were calculated from the standard curve<br>
constructed under the same experimental conditions for IL-12, IL-6 and IFN- â€¢<br>
respectively.<br>
The oligonucleotides used n this study are presented in Table 18.<br>
