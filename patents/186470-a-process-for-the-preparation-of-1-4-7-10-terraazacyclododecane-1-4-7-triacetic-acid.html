The invention relates to a process for the preparation<br>
of  l,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid (more commonly known as D03A) of formula (I)<br><br>
is the key intermediate for the synthesis of mono-M-substituted derivatives of formula {VIII),<br>
wherein <br>
R^  and R2 are independently a hydrogen atom, a (^3^-^20) alkyl containing 1 to 10 oxygen atoms, or a phenyl, phenyloxy, phenyldioxy group, which is in its turn unsubstituted  or  substituted with a (C1-C5)  alkyl or hydroxy, (C1-C5) alkoxy, carbamoyl or carboxylic groups. Such compounds are used in particular for the synthesis of complexes with metal ions, specifically when the metals are paramagnetic, for the preparation of non-ionic contrast agents for the diagnostic technique known as magnetic resonance (MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging),  among which are ProHance(R)  (Gadoteridol, gadolinium  complex  of  10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-l,4,7,10-<br><br>
tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic     acid)     and Gadobutrol (gadolinium complex of [10-[2,3-dihydroxy-l-(hydroxymethy1)propyl]-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid).<br><br>
The synthesis of compound (I) was first described in EP 29,2689 and EP 232,751 and subsequently a paper was published (Dischino et al., Inorg. Chem., 1991, 30, 1255) which compared the possible synthetic routes with the most efficient one, which is that represented in Scheme 1, starting from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane disulfate (II), a commercially available product.<br><br><br>
The step from compound (II) to compound (III), 5H,9bH-2a,4a,7-octahydrotetraazacycloocta[cd]pentalene, is effected according to the conventional method described in US 4085106, followed by formation of 1-formyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane of formula (IV) in water-alcohol medium.<br>
This intermediate is subsequently tricarboxymethylated in dimethylformamide at 2.5'C with tert-butyl bromoacetate (TBBA), then treated with a diphasic toluene-sodium hydroxide mixture to give the compound of formula (V), 10-formyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l ,4, 7-triacetic acid, tris(l,l-dimethylethyl) ester, which is then hydrolysed to compound of formula (I) in acidic solution.<br>
The industrialization of this synthesis involves a number of serious problems, in that:<br>
the  tert-butyl  bromoacetate  (TBBA)  reactive  is<br>
extremely toxic and very expensive;<br>
dimethylformamide is harmful, teratogenic, and has<br>
a unnegligible cost;<br><br>
the use of toluene involves risks of explosion due to electrostatic self-ignition;<br>
the use of a mixture of two solvents (DMF and toluene) makes the recovery of both of them expensive;<br>
the operative procedure is long and troublesome,<br>
obviously  affecting  the  production  costs,  and<br>
involves many critical operations to a successful<br>
synthesis, therefore implying a remarkable cost of<br>
the process controls and/or the reduction of the<br>
chances of the success of the synthesis.<br>
Moreover, during the hydrolysis step from compound<br>
(VI) to compound (I), gaseous isobutene is formed, which<br>
has necessarily to be absorbed due to environmental<br>
reasons.<br>
Finally, notwithstanding the expensive experimental conditions, the selectivity of the carboxymethylation and hydrolysis reactions is not sufficient to obtain the compound of formula (I) at a high purity grade, thereby making it necessary a purification step of compound (I), for example by chromatography or by crystallization.<br>
It is therefore evident that, to make an industrial production possible, the synthesis of compound (I) should be improved, reducing, when possible, the number of the synthetic steps and limiting the use of organic solvents and of reactives for the formation of the protective groups.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, and this is the object of the present invention, a process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I), which comprises the steps represented in Scheme 2:<br><br><br>
in which<br>
a) is the carboxymethylation reaction starting from<br>
(III) or (IV), in water, in molar ratios of<br>
haloacetic acid to compound (IV) or (III) ranging<br>
from 3 to 5 mol/mol, at pH ranging from 9.5 to 12.5<br>
by addition of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal<br>
hydroxide, at a temperature from 7 to 50°C, for a<br>
time between 3 and 48h, to give the intermediate of<br>
formula	(VI),	10-formyl-l,4,7,10-<br>
tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid salt with the metal cation corresponding to the used hydroxide, which, without being isolated, undergoes the hydrolysis reaction corresponding to step b);<br><br>
b)	is the hydrolysis reaction of the intermediate (VI)<br>
in basic conditions by addition of the same base as<br>
at step a), at a pH higher than 12.5, at a<br>
temperature ranging between 65°C and 100°C and for<br>
a time from 5 to 48 h, to give an aqueous solution<br>
of the salt of formula (VII), which, without being<br>
isolated, undergoes step c);<br>
c)	is the isolation step of compound (I), which is<br>
generally unnecessary and can be carried out, for<br>
example, by chromatographic steps on ion exchange<br>
resins.<br>
A further object of the present invention are the<br>
novel	compound,	lO-formyl-1,4,7,10-<br>
tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid of formula (Via), as well as the salts thereof with an alkali or alkaline-earth metal, of formula (VI),<br><br>
as intermediates in the process for the preparation of compound (I) .<br>
Particularly preferred are the salts of formula (VI), with sodium, potassium or calcium.<br>
Particularly preferred is the use of bromoacetic acid and chloroacetic acid in the carboxymethylation step a).<br>
The preferred conditions to carry out step a) are the following ones:<br><br>
molar ratio of haloacetic acid to compound (III) or<br>
(IV) from 3.2 to 4.5;<br>
pH from 10 to 12.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the process for the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid (D03A) mono-N-substituted derivatives of formula (VIII),<br>
wherein <br>
R^ and R2 are independently a hydrogen atom, a (C^-C2o) alkyl containing 1 to 10 oxygen atoms, or a phenyl, phenyloxy, phenyldioxy group, which is in its turn unsubstituted or substituted with a (C^-Cg) alkyl or hydroxy, (C^-Cg) alkoxy, carbamoyl or carboxylic groups,<br>
comprising the following steps represented in Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
starting from compounds of formula (III) or (IV), through the formation of intermediate (VI) by means of the carboxymethylation reaction a), as defined above, and the subsequent hydrolysis b), as defined above, to give the alkaline aqueous solution of the alkali or alkaline-earth metal salt of compound (VII), which can be alkylated with an epoxide of formula (IX), in which R-^  and R2 have the meanings defined above.<br>
Particularly preferred is the preparation of 10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l ,4,7-triacetic acid), <br><br>
in which the epoxide of formula (IX) is propylene oxide, and    the    preparation   of    C10-[2,3-dihydroxy-l-(hydroxymethy1)propyl]-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid),<br><br>
in which the epoxide of formula (IX) is 4,4-dimethyl-3 , 5,8-trioxabicyclo[5.1.0]octane .<br>
Therefore, the process of the present invention makes it possible to carry out the carboxymethylation of compounds (IV) or (III) in aqueous solution, thus completely avoiding the use of undesired organic solvents.<br>
More specifically, the carboxymethylation of (III) or (IV) in aqueous solution requires the use of a slight excess of a haloacetic acid, in the cited pH and temperature conditions.<br>
The reaction yields a novel compound of formula (VI), acid 10-formyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l , 4 , 7-triacetic acid, with a high selectivity, in aqueous alkaline solution which at the end of the reaction contains the haloacetic acid excess.<br>
The confirmation of the structure of compound (VI) was carried out indirectly, due to its very high reactivity, by comparing the analytical data with those of the product resulting from the formylation reaction of compound  (I),  and  it will  be  described  in  the<br><br>
Experimental section.<br>
The deprotection of the formyl group in acidic medium, in the conditions already described in EP 292,689, can not be applied to the present process, in that the presence of a haloacetic acid excess would cause the conversion of compound (I) to DOTA as soon as pH is again made alkaline (for example, in an free-N alkylation step).<br>
It is therefore a further object of the present invention the hydrolysis of (VI) in suitable basic conditions instead of in acidic conditions, so as to destroy the haloacetic acid excess before the deformylation of compound (VI).<br>
The described conditions concerning carboxymethylation and hydrolysis make the process for the preparation of compound (I) dramatically easier.<br>
Actually, as already mentioned, it is not even necessary to prepare intermediate (IV), in that its precursor, i.e. compound (III), can be used, thereby limiting the risk of hydrolysing the formyl group and, therefore, the need for controls of the process and production times, according to scheme 4.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br><br>
Compound (VI), therefore, is treated according to the reaction scheme already represented in Scheme 2.<br>
The absence of gaseous by-products which are to be absorbed (such as isobutene) and of organic solvents, finally, are a further advantage of the process from the environmental and economic point of views.<br>
One of the advantages provided by the process of the invention is that an aqueous solution of the compound of formula (I) is finally obtained, which can directly be used as such for the subsequent synthetic step, for the preparation of, for example, Gadobutrol and Gadoteridol.<br>
As an example, in the case of the preparation of Gadoteridol, as described in EP 292,689, the alkaline aqueous solution of compound (I) is treated with propylene oxide to give, after the alkylation reaction, 10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (commonly known as HPD03A), which is subsequently reacted with a gadolinium salt to obtain crude Gadoteridol.<br>
The following examples illustrate the best experimental conditions to carry out the process of the invention.<br>
The progress of the reactions is monitored by HPLC, using the following method:<br>
Column:        Polymer Labs PLRP-S 250 x 4 pm Elution:      isocratic Mobile phase:  A/B = 99/1<br>
A: 50mM NH4H2PO4 adjusted to pH 4 with 85% H3PO4 B: Methanol<br><br>
Temperature     : 30*^0<br>
Detection      : 270 nm<br>
Flow	: 0,5 mL/min<br>
Preparation of the sample: About 2 mg of product are placed in  a<br>
20 mL flask, then added with 0.5 ml of a solution of about 0.1  M<br>
CuCl2  X 2H2O, derivatized for 15 min. at 35*^0, then  brought  to<br>
volume with the eluent.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraa2acyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid of the formula I and the salts thereof, which comprises the steps according to the following scheme<br><br><br>
wherein step (a) is carboxymethylation of the substrate III or IV, the latter being obtained directly from III, said carboxymethylation being carried out under basic conditions in water, with a haloacetic acid, to give intermediate (VI), wherein M3 is an alkali or alkaline-earth metal and n is 1 or 2, and step (b) is hydrolysis under basic conditions by addition of the same base as at step (a), to give an aqueous solution of the salt of formula (VII), which is converted into the corresponding acidic form and is recovered therefrom in a known manner.<br><br>

Then the solution is heated to 50°C and pH is adjusted to 7 with sodium hydroxide, and the solution is maintained at these conditions for Ih.<br>
E)	Prepurification  of  the  crude  Gadoteridol<br><br>
solution<br>
The crude Gadoteridol solution from the previous step is cooled and transferred through an in line filter and a column filled with 150 L of R&amp;H Amberlite XAD 1600 resin, to a nanofiltration unit fitted with Desal DK4040F elements. When the reactor is empty, the reactor, the in line filter and the column are washed three times with 300 L of deionized water.<br>
The resulting washing solution is combined with the product solution in the nanofiltration unit, where the product is concentrated and partially desalted at 32 bar and 25'C.<br>
250 L of crude Gadoteridol solution with a conductivity of 2.9 mS/cm are obtained finally.<br>
F)   Final desalting<br>
The Gadoteridol solution is then fed at 200 L/h to a series of 4 ion exchanger beds, the first (CI) consisting of 120 L of strongly basic anion exchanger Relite 3ASfb in the hydrogen carbonate form, the second (C2) consisting of 100 L of weakly acidic cation exchanger Relite CC in the H+ form, the third (C3) consisting of 20 L of Relite 3ASfb in the 0H- form and the fourth (C4) consisting of 20 L of Relite CC resin in the H+ form. All the columns are vented to the atmosphere and the liquid from the second column is passed through a gas separation tank, connected with a vacuum pump, to remove the evolved CO2 from the solution. The outlet from the fourth column is fitted with a density transmitter to detect the product in the eluate. The first 180 L of eluate are discarded; the eluate is then collected in a product-rich fraction.<br><br>
When all the crude Gadoteridol solution has been loaded onto the ion exchange unit, the product is eluted with 600 L of deionized water, the eluate is then combined with the product-rich fraction, which is colourless and substantially free from ionic impurities (conductivity 2.2 pS/cm).<br>
The yield of the final desalting, determined on the basis of the HPLC assay, is 98%.<br>
G)   Isolation of the product (Gadoteridol)<br>
The product-rich fraction is then thermally concentrated to a viscous residue, which is added with 350 kg of isopropanol at 79°C. The resulting suspension is refluxed for 1 h, then cooled, centrifuged and dried at reduced pressure, to obtain 68.2 kg of Gadoteridol containing 10% of hydration water (0.111 kmol), HPLC assay 98.5% (s.a.). Overall yield: 80.7%<br>
The IR and MS spectra are consistent with the indicated structure.<br>

100 g (0.225 mol) of compound (III), recovered as sulfate (prepared as described in example IB) are dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water and treated with 27 g (0.458 mol) of propylene oxide at pH 12.3 by addition of ION NaOH. After reacting for 3h at 40'C, the solution is acidified to pH 1.7 with cone. HjSO^, and it is kept at this pH for 1 h. After that, pH is adjusted<br><br>
to 3.8 with ION NaOH and the solution is concentrated under vacuum to 200 mL. 400 ml of methanol are added to the mixture, which is heated to 60°C for 1 h, then cooled to room temperature, and the inorganic salts are filtered off and washed with methanol.<br>
Methanol is distilled off from the filtrate, making up with water. The resulting solution is percolated on a bed of polyvynylpyridine resin.<br>
The fractions containing the product are concentrated to 400 mL and treated with 68 g (0.576 mol) of CaCO^. The mixture is refluxed for 90 min., cooled and the insoluble salts are filtered off. The filtrate is concentrated to 250 mL and added to 2 L of acetone.<br>
