[NAME OF DOCUMENT]	SPECIFICATION<br>
[TITLE OF THE INVENTION]     ONE-WAY CLUTCH<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a one-way clutch arranged on a shaft member.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
A one-way clutch generally includes an outer shaft, rollers, elastic members  a<br>
cover, and a plate.    The outer shaft has a plurality of pockets arranged radially outside the<br>
shaft member.    The rollers and elastic members are arranged in the plurality of pockets.<br>
The cover axially covers one side of each pocket, and the plate axially covers the other side<br>
of each pocket<br>
[0003]<br>
In this one-way clutch, when the shaft member rotates in a first direction, the<br>
pockets and the elastic members keep the rollers unmovable so that the rollers transmit<br>
power of the shaft member to the outer shaft.    When the shaft member rotates in a second<br><br>
direction opposite to the first direction, the rollers become movable in the pockets.<br>
Therefore, the rollers freely rotate in the pockets, and do not transmit the power from the<br>
shaft member to the outer shaft.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the above one-way clutch, which is disclosed, e.g., in a Patent Reference 1, a<br>
plate is provided with protrusions, and these protrusions are fitted into attaching apertures<br>
formed in an outer shaft for attaching the plate to the outer shaft.<br>
Patent Reference 1:<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2003-172377<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0005]<br>
In a conventional one-way clutch, it is necessary to form apertures in the outer<br>
shaft for attaching the plate to the outer shaft, and to form the protrusions on the plate for<br>
fitting into the apertures in the extemal shaft.   Therefore, it is necessary to effect working<br>
on both the extemal shaft and the plate.<br><br>
An object of the invention is to simplify a structure that supports the plate on the<br>
outer shaft.<br>
[0007]<br>
A one-way clutch of claim 1 is attachable to a shaft member, and has an annular<br>
outer shaft, rollers, biasing members, a cover, and an annular plate.    The outer shaft is<br>
arranged radially outside the shaft member, and has a plurality of pockets hollowed<br>
radially outward from its inner peripheral portion.    The rollers are arranged in the<br>
plurality of pockets.   The biasing members are arranged in the plurality of pockets to bias<br>
circumferentially the rollers.    The cover axially covers one side of the pockets.    The<br>
plate axially covers the other side of the pockets, and has a plurality of supporting portions<br>
inserted into at least one of the plurality of pockets to support the plate on the outer shaft.<br>
[0008]<br>
In this one-way clutch, the biasing member always circumferentially biases the<br>
roller in one direction (i.e., first direction).   When the shaft member rotates in the first<br>
direction, each roller is fritter moved in the first direction according to the rotation of the<br>
shaft member.    In this state, the roller is unmovably engaged in between the shaft member<br><br>
and the outer shaft, and power is transmitted from the shaft member via the roller to the<br>
outer shaft.    When the shaft‚Äù member rotates oppositely to the first direction, the rotation<br>
of the shaft member moves the roller toward the biasing member against the biasing force<br>
of the biasing member.    In this operation, since a space allowing movement of the roller is<br>
present between the shaft member and the pocket, the roller finely rotates between the<br>
shaft member and the outer shaft, and does not transmit power from the shaft member to<br>
the outer shaft.<br>
[0009]<br>
In the above one-way clutch, the plate is supported by the pockets of the extemal<br>
shaft via the supporting portions formed at the plate, and the structure that supports the<br>
plate can be simple.    Thus, it is required to form the structure that supports the plate on<br>
only the plate side.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to claim 2, the one-way clutch of claim 1 fritter has a feature such that<br>
the plurality of supporting portions is formed by bending the radially inner end of the plate<br>
toward the cover.<br><br>
In this structure, the supporting portion of the plate can have a simple structure.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to claim 3, the one-way clutch of claim 2 further has a feature such that<br>
the plurality of supporting portions is arranged such that the supporting portions are<br>
located in each of the plurality of pockets, and is in contact with the circumferentially<br>
opposite ends of the pocket.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to claim 4, the one-way clutch of claim 3 further has a feature such that<br>
the plurality of supporting portions prevent dropping of the rollers and the biasing<br>
members from the pocket when the outer shaft is not attached to the shaft member.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to claim 5^ the one-way clutch of claim 1 further has a feature such that<br>
the biasing member is a wavy plate spring having one end being in contact with an end of<br>
the pocket and the other end being contactable with the roller.<br>

[PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION]<br>
[0017]<br>
A one-way clutch 1 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is arranged on a shaft member 2, and<br>
has an outer shaft 3 arranged around the shaft member 2, rollers 6 and wavy plate springs 7<br>
arranged within the outer shaft 3, a cover 8 covering a side surface of the outer shaft 3, and<br>
a plate 9 covering the side surface of the outer shaft 3<br>
[0018]<br>
The outer shaft 3 is an armular member that receives a power from the shaft<br>
member 2, and is provided at its radially inner side with a plurality of (six in this<br>
embodiment) pockets IL   The outer shaft 3 is provided with six apertures 13 that are<br>
circumferentially equally spaced from each other^ and is also provided with six pockets 11<br>
each located between the neighboring two apertures 13.   A bolt (not shown) is inserted<br>
into each aperture 13 so that the one-way clutch 1 is attached to another member of a drive<br>
system.<br>
[0019]<br><br>
Since the six pockets 11 have the same form, only one of the pockets 11 will be<br>
described below.<br>
[0020]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the pocket 11 is formed at the radially inner end of the outer<br>
shaft 3, and is hollowed radially outward from the radially inner end.    The pocket 11 has a<br>
radially extending first side wall 21, a circumferentially extending second side wall 22, a<br>
third side wall 23 connecting the first and second side walls 21 and 22, a radially extending<br>
fourth side wall 24, a circumferentially extending fifth side wall 25, a sixth side wall 26<br>
connecting the fourth and fifth side walls 24 and 25, and a seventh side wall 27 connecting<br>
the second and fifth side walls 22 and 25,    The first side wall 21 is defined by a plane<br>
extending radially outward from the radially inner end of the outer shaft 3.    The second<br>
side wall 22 is in contact with a radially outer side of the roller 6, and is configure  such<br>
that a distance to the inner peripheral portion of the outer shaft decreases when the position<br>
moves from the side where the wavy plate spring 7 is arranged toward the side of<br>
arrangement of the roller 6.   The third side wall 23 smoothly connects the first and second<br>
side walls 21 and 22.    The fourth side wall 24 carries one end of the wavy plate spring 7,<br><br>
which will be described later, and extends radially outward in a plane form from the<br>
radially inner end of the outer shaft 3.   The fifth side wall 25 is formed radially inside the<br>
second side wall 22.   The sixth side wall 26 smoothly connects the fourth and fifth side<br>
walls 24 and 25.   The seventh side wall 27 smoothly connects the second and fifth side<br>
walls 22 and 25.<br>
[0021]<br>
The roller 6 is a cylindrical member arranged in each of the pockets 11 to transmit<br>
power transmitted from the shaft member 2 to the outer shaft 3.    The wavy plate spring 7<br>
biases the roller 6 toward the first side wall 21 of the pocket 11.<br>
[0022]<br>
The wavy plate spring 7 is arranged in each of the pockets  11  to bias<br>
circumferentially the roller 6.   The wavy plate spring 7 has one end in contact with the<br>
roller 6 and the other end located near the fourth side wall 24 of the pocket 11.<br>
[0023]<br>
The cover 8 is a member axially covering the side surface on one side of the<br>
^pocket 11.    As shown in Fig. 2, the cover 8 has an annular plate portion 8a provided to<br><br>
prevent the roller 6 and the wavy plate spring 7 from moving axially from the pocket 11,<br>
and also has a cylindrical portion 8b formed at the outer periphery of the annular plate<br>
portion 8a.<br>
[0024]<br>
The plate 9 is an annular member axially covering the side surface on the side<br>
remote from the cover 8 of each pocket 11, and prevents the roller 6 and the wavy plate<br>
spring 7 from axially moving.   The plate 9 is provided at its inner peripheral portion with<br>
twelve plate-like protrusions 30 protruding toward the cover 8.   As shown on an enlarged<br>
scale in Fig, 5, each protrusion 30 is formed by bending a portion of the radially inner end<br>
of the plate 9 toward the cover, and is arranged such that the protrusions 30 are in contact<br>
with the circumferentially opposite ends of the radially inner end of the pocket 11,<br>
respectively.    The protrusions 30 are also arranged as follows.   When the one-way clutch<br>
1 is not attached to the shaft member 2 and the roller 6 is in contact vetch the first side wall<br>
21 of the pocket 11, plane portions (surfaces on the radially outer side) of the protrusions<br>
30 are in contact with the roller 6 and the wavy plate spring 7.<br><br>
Operations will be described below.<br>
[0026]<br>
When the shaft member 2 rotates in a direction R shown in Fig. 1 with respect to<br>
the outer shaft 3, the rotation of the shaft member 2 moves the roller 6 toward the first side<br>
wall 21 of the pocket 11,   Thereby, the roller 6 engages in between the first side wall 21<br>
of the pocket 11 and the outer peripheral surface of the shaft member 2 as shown in Fig. 4<br>
so that the shaft member 2 and the outer shaft 3 restrict the movement of the roller 6.<br>
Thereby, the torque of the shaft member 2 is transmitted to the outer shaft 3 via the rollers<br>
6.<br>
[0027]<br>
When the shaft member 2 rotates oppositely to the direction R with respect to the<br>
outer shaft 3, the rotation of the shaft member 2 moves the roller 6 against the biasing force<br>
of the wavy plate spring 7 toward the fourth side wall 24 of the pocket 11,    Thereby, as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, a space is formed between the second side wall 22 of the pocket 11 and<br>
the outer peripheral surface of the shaft member 2, and the roller 6 freely rotates in the<br><br>
pocket 11.    In this state, the shaft member 2 and the outer shaft 3 are in the fi"ee state,<br>
Thereby, the torque is not transmitted from the shaft member 2 to the outer shaft 3.<br>
[0028]<br>
In an operation of attaching the one-way clutch 1 to the shaft member 2, the<br>
protrusions 30 of the plate 9 are inserted into the radially inner portions of the pockets 11<br>
in the outer shaft 3 so that the outer shaft 3 supports the plate 9.    Thereby, the whole<br>
one-way clutch 1 can be provisionally assembled as a unit, which facilitates attaching of<br>
the one-way clutch 1 to the shaft member 2.    Before attaching the one-way clutch 1 to the<br>
shaft member 2, the protrusions 30 suppress dropping of the rollers 6 and the wavy plate<br>
springs 7 from the pockets 11.    This further facilitates the assembling operation of<br>
attaching the one-way clutch 1 to the shaft member 2,<br>
[0029]<br>
[Other Embodiments]<br>
(a) In the embodiment already described, the inner peripheral portion of the plate<br>
9 has portions protruding radially inward, and these protruding portions are bent toward the<br>
cover to form the protrusions.    However, the protrusion may have another structure.<br><br>
For example, the structure of Fig. 6 may be employed.    A circumferential slit 9a<br>
of a predetermined length is formed radially outside the radially inner end of the plate 9,<br>
such a radial slit is formed that extends from a circumferentially middle portion of the slit<br>
9a to the inner periphery of the plate 9, and the left and right portions thus formed are bent<br>
toward the cover to form protrusions 31<br>
[0031]<br>
The structure of Fig. 7 may also be employed.    Two slits 9b are formed<br>
corresponding to a circumferential length of each pocket, such a slit is formed that extends<br>
from an end of each slit 9b to the inner periphery, and the end portion thus formed is bent<br>
toward the cover to form a protrusion 32.<br>
[0032]<br>
(b) In the foregoing embodiments, the protrusions of the plate are inserted into all<br>
the pockets.    However, the protrusions may be inserted into only some of the pockets.<br>
[INDUSTRIALLY APPLICABLE FIELD]<br>
[0033]<br><br>
The invention can simplify the structure for attaching the plate to one side surface<br>
ofthe output shaft.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
