3-ALKENYLCEPHEM COMPOUNDS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel amine salts of 7-substituted acylamino-3-[2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and to a process for preparing the same.  The invention relates also to a process for preparing 7-amido-3-[2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and amine salts thereof which are improved in the content of 7-substituted acylamino-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid or the amine salt thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An oral cephem agent, cefditoren pivoxil of the<br>
formula (4), is in wide used as an antibacterial agent having a broad antimicrobial spectrum and strong antibacterial activities.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
With cephalosporin antibiotics having alkenyl at the 3-position, the steric structure of the alkenyl group at the 3-position has Z configuration as is the case with<br>
cefditoren pivoxil.  The mechanism of producing outstanding antibacterial activities on gram-negative bacteria is attributable partly to this feature.  For the antibacterial pharmaceutical agent to exhibit its effect, therefore, it is important to diminish to the greatest possible extent the presence of the geometrical E-isomer of cefditoren pivoxil.  In preparing cefditoren pivoxil, attempts have been made to improve the Z-isomer content of process intermediates.<br>
For example, a process has been disclosed for preparing an amine salt of Z/E mixture of 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, a process intermediate and depleting the amine salt of 7-amino-3-[(E)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid by crystallization (see, for example, Patent Literature 1).<br>
[Patent Literature 1] JP1995-188250 A<br>
The process disclosed in the literature, however, is not satisfactory in the yields of the desired 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and the salt thereof which are depleted in the E-isomer content, and the amine salt can not be filtered off efficiently.  Thus, the process can not be said to be a suitable process from an economical viewpoint (see Comparative Example 1).<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 3-alkenylcephem compound useful as an intermediate in the process for preparing cefditoren pivoxil which is in wide use as an excellent antibacterial agent.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an economically outstanding and industrially suitable process for preparing a 3-alkenylcephem compound which is improved in Z-isomer content.<br>

(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as above.<br>
According to the above reaction scheme, the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) is prepared by reacting an amine compound of the formula (3) with a 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) in a suitable solvent.<br>
Although the solvent to be used differs depending on the amine compound to be used and the amine salt to be prepared, the solvent is, for example, water, or a solvent mixture of water and an organic solvent.  Examples of useful organic solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and like alcohols, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and like ketones, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate and like esters, N,N-<br>

The mixing ratio of the organic solvent to water is 1 to 10 parts by volume, preferably 1.5 to 8 parts by volume, more preferably 2 to 5 parts by volume, of the organic solvent per part by volume of water.<br>
The solvent is used in an amount sufficient to dissolve or suspend the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) therein although the amount differs with the kind of solvent to be used.  The solvent is used, for example, in an amount of about 2 to about 50 parts by volume, preferably about 3 to about 40 parts by volume, most preferably about 5 to about 25 parts by volume, per part by weight of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2).<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) to be used in the present reaction can be prepared by known processes. The compound can be prepared by synthesizing a 3- [2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ester and effecting a deprotecting reaction for the 4-position carboxylic acid protective group thereof, for example, by the processes disclosed in The Journal of Antiobiotics, Vol. XLIII, No. 8, 1047-1050(1990), Chem. Pharm. Bull. 39(9), 2433-2436(1991), JP1987-19593A, JP1991-64503B, Journal of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, Vol. 60, No.2, 155-161(2002), etc.  Usable for the deprotecting reaction are various procedures generally<br>
known for the deprotecting reaction of the carboxylic acid ester protective group of j3-lactam compounds.  Useful are, for example, a method of catalytic reduction with use of a noble metal, and acid treatment methods disclosed in Am. Chem. Soc. 91, 5674(1969), Chem. Pharm. Bull. 30, 4545 (1982), Tetrahedron Lett. 2793 (1979), JP1994-4638B, etc.<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) to be used in the present reaction is a 3-(E/Z)-alkenylcephem compound comprising a 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2a) and a 3-(E)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2b) which are conjointly present.

The term "E-isomer content" as used herein means the proportion of the E-isomer present in the combined amount of the E-isomer and the Z-isomer.  The E-isomer content is given by<br>
E-isomer content (%) = 100 X (amount of E-isomer present)/ {(amount of E-isomer present) + (amount of Z-isomer present) }<br>

The amine compound is used in an amount of 1.0 to 2.5 moles, preferably 1.0 to 2.0 moles, more preferably 1.0 to 1.5 moles, per mole of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2).<br>
The reaction temperature, which varies with the amine to be used and the amine salt to be obtained, is up<br>
to 10°C, preferably about 0 to about 5°C.  The reaction time is such that the reaction is conducted until the compound of the formula (2) serving as the starting material disappears.  The reaction is completed generally in 0.5 to 7 hours.<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) to be prepared by the present reaction a 3-(E/Z)-alkenylcephem compound retaining the E/Z isomer content ratio of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) used.<br>
The solution (reaction mixture) of the 3-­alkenylcephem compound of the formula (I) resulting from the present reaction is usable as it is for the process for preparing the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) to be described below and improved in the content of 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la).<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) which is improved in the content of 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la) can be produced by preparing a solution of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) comprising an E-isomer and a Z-isomer which are conjointly present and adding an organic solvent to the solution.<br>
The preferred solvent to be used is one which is capable of adjusting the solubility product.  It is important that the Z-isomer (la) of the compound of the formula (1) and the E-isomer (Ib) thereof be different in solubility in the solvent.  The greater the difference between the solubilities, the more suitable the solvent is<br>
to the process of the invention.  Examples of suitable solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and like alcohols, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane and like ethers, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane and like aliphatic hydrocarbons, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, cyclooctanone and like alicyclic ketones, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and like aliphatic ketones, etc.<br>
Preferable among these are methanol, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, n-hexane, n-hexanone and acetone.<br>
These solvents are used, for example, in an amount of about 3 to 30 parts by volume, preferably about 4 to about 25 parts by volume, most preferably about 5 to about 20 parts by volume, per part by weight of 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1).<br>
The solubility product adjusting solvent is added to the solution of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1), whereby a 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la) is crystallized generally selectively.<br>
It is desired to effect the crystallization at a low temperature of 0 to 10°C, preferably of 0 to not higher than 5°C.<br>
The crystals separating out are collected by a usual method such as filtration, whereby a 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) can be obtained which is improved in the content of 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la).<br>
The content of the 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of<br>
the formula (la) in the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) obtained by the process of the invention varies with the content of the 3-(E)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2b) in the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) used.  If the content of the 3-(E)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2b) is up to 20%, the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) usually contains at least 96%, preferably 97 to 99.99%, more preferably 99 to 99.95%, of the 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la).  The process of the invention can be repeated in order to achieve a further improved content.<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1) obtained by the process of the invention and improved in the content of the 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (la) is dissolved or suspended in water, and a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, is thereafter added to the solution or suspension to adjust the pH thereof to an acidity of 0.5 to 4, whereby a 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) can be prepared which is improved in the content of 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2a).<br>
The amount of water to be used is not limited particularly but may be such that the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (I) can be fully dissolved or suspended therein.  For example, about 5 to about 50 parts by volume of water is used per part by weight of the 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (1).<br>
The 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) is<br>
crystallized by adjusting the pH, and the crystals separated out are filtered off, washed with water and dried, whereby a 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2) can be obtained which is improved in the content of 3-(Z)-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2a).<br>
It is likely that crystals fail to separate out depending, for example, on the kind of amine salt and the amount of water.  In this case, the product can be crystallized by subjecting the aqueous solution to extraction with at least one of organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and like ketones, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and like esters, methylene chloride, chloroform and like hydrocarbon halides, and benzene, toluene and like aromatic hydrocarbons, concentrating the organic solvent in a vacuum for a volume reduction, and thereafter adding a poor solvent comprising methanol, ethanol, isopropyl ... . alcohol and like lower alcohol, and diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether and like lower ether.<br>
The process of the invention, when repeated, further reduces the E-isomer content of 3-alkenylcephem compound of the formula (2).<br>
