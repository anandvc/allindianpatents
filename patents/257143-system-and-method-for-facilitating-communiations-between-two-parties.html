				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for facilitating communications between two parties. The invention is particularly directed towards facilitating communications between two customers of a telecommunications carrier, one of the customers wishing to reply to messages for free or who may no longer having sufficient credit with the telecommunications carrier to initiate or continue communication.<br>
Background Art<br>
The following discussion of the background of the invention is intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention. However, it should be appreciated that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any of file material referred to was published, known or part of the common general knowledge of the person skilled in the art in any jurisdiction as at the date of the application.<br>
A pre-paid mobile phone subscriber can often have a zero balance with their telecommunications carrier or insufficient pre-paid credits to carry out a transaction, place a voice call or send an SMS message or text. In the case if zero balance, this prevents the subscriber from initiating or continuing communication - particularly in situations where communication is being facilitated by SMS or similar messaging arrangement. Depending on the telecommunications carrier, this may also prevent the subscriber from receiving communications.<br>
This situation can be frustrating for people seeking to communicate with the subscriber. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system whereby a party can communicate with a subscriber who may wish to avail of a free reply to a message or who may not having sufficient credit with their telecommunications carrier to initiate or continue communication.<br><br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>
in accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is a system for facilitating communications between a first and second party, each having a communications device for communicating with the communication facilitator, and at least the first party having credit with the communication facilitator, where, to assist the second party to communicate with the first party;<br>
the first party sends. a first communication message using the first communications device to a first destination address associated with the communication facilitator;<br>
the communication facilitator determines unique .identifiers of the communications devices possessed by the first and second party, respectively, from the first communication message or information associated with the first communication message;<br>
the communication facilitator includes the first communication message, or at least a portion thereof, in a second communication message which is sent to the communications device of the second party, as determined byb its unique identifier, via a second destination address;<br>
the second party replies to the second communication message using its communications device, the reply being received by the communication facilitator, and<br>
the communication facilitator operates to forward the reply to the second communication message to the first communications device of the first party, as determined by its unique identifier, and make a charge against the<br><br>
credit the first party has with the communication facilitator for at feast ihe first communication message and the reply to the second communication message, the credit the first party has with the communication facilitator being identified by way of the unique identifier of the first communications device.<br>
The first and second destination addresses may each be associated with a shortcode. Alternatively, the first and second destination addresses may be associated with the same shortcode.<br>
The first communication message may be sent to a destination address comprising the shortcode associated with the first communication address and a unique identifier represenfing the second party. Similarly, the reply to the second communication message may-be sent to a destination address comprising the shortcode associated with the second communication address and a unique identifier representing the first party. Alternatively, the unique identifier of the first party or the second party, as appropriate to the message sent, may be included in the body of the communication message.<br>
The second communication message may also include the unique identifier of the first party. In this manner, the reply to the second communication message, by including the unique identifier of the first party, can be properly matched, up with the first party.<br>
The unique identifier may be the party's mobile phone number, home phone number, or e-mai! address. The first and second communication message, and the reply, may take the form of a SMS message; MMS message; or e-mail message.<br>
The communication facilitator may establish a virtual credit account and associate the virtual credit account with the second party. In this arrangement, whenever the communication facilitator receives a first communication message, the virtual credit account is incremented and when the communication facilitator receives a reply  to  the  second  communication  message  the virtual   credit account is<br><br>
decremented. The virtual credit account may also be associated with the first party to ensure that the second party may only use credits accrued in the virtual credit account for replies to the first party. Thus, a second party may have multiple virtual credit accounts.<br>
Alternatively, the communication facilitator may operate to increment the credit the second party has with the communication facilitator by an amount specified in the first communication message. In such an arrangement, the second party is informed of the amount of increase in their credit<br>
The communication facilitator may be separate from, or a part of, a telecommunications carrier.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is a system for facilitating communications between a first and second party, each having a communications device for communicating with the communication facilitator and at least the first party having credit with the communication facilitator, where, to assist the second party to communicate with the first party:<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will be better understood in me light of the following description, made with reference to the drawings, wherein:-<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a system for facilitating, communications between parties in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Best Mode{s} for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention there is a system 10 for facilitating communications between two parties 12, 14. In this embodiment, parties 12, 14 are mobile phone subscribers of a telecommunications carrier 16. Party 12 has a large credit balance with the telecommunications carrier 16. Party 14 has a zero credit balance with the telecommunications carrier 16.<br>
Telecommunications carrier 16 operates:<br>
•   a first destination address 18 having an associated shortcode 20; and<br>
•   a second destination address 22 having an associated shortcode 24.<br><br>
In this embodiment, associated shortcode 20 is the prefix "5" and associated shortcode 24 is the prefix "6".<br>
The operation of the system 10 of this embodiment will now be described in the context of the following example.<br>
Party 12 sends an SMS message 26 intended for party 14 using their mobile phone. The SMS message 26 is sent to the first destination address 18 by sending the SMS message 25 to a combination of associated shortcode 20 and the mobile phone number of party 14.<br>
Telecommunications carrier 16 receives the SMS message 26 via the destination address. Upon receipt, telecommunications carrier 16 operates to amend the SMS message 26. to form a new SMS message 28. SMS message 28 includes the content of SMS message 26 and an additional note. The additional note is intended to inform party 14 that a reply to SMS message 28 will be passed to party 12 without charge. SMS message 28 is then sent to party's 14 mobile phone. The source address (ie. the phone number of the communication initiator) of the SMS message 28 is set to a combination of associated shortcode 24 and the mobile phone number of party 12.<br>
In conjunction with forming SMS message 28, the telecommunications carrier. 16 operates to establish a virtual credit account 30 (if not already established). Virtual credit account 30 is associated with party 14 (by means of party's 14 mobile phone number). If virtual credit account 30 is already established, the value of the virtual credit account is incremented by one. Otherwise, the virtual credit account 30 is set to an initial value of 1.<br>
Party 14 then replies to SMS message 28 by means of further SMS message 32. As further SMS message 32 is sent in reply to SMS message 28, it is received by telecommunications carrier 16 at second destination address 22. Telecommunications carrier 16 processes the further SMS message 32 to identify the mobile phone number of the sender. The mobile phone number of the sender<br><br>
is then used as a reference for determining the associated virtual credit account 30. The associated virtual credit account 30 is then decremented by 1.<br>
The further SMS message 32 is then forwarded by telecommunications carrier 16 to party 12. The charges for each SMS message 26, 28, 32, plus any service charge levied by the telecommunications carrier 16, are all debited from parly's 12 account with the telecommunications carrier 16.<br>
A second embodiment of the invention will now be described. The configuration of the second embodiment is identical to that of the first embodiment already described. Accordingly, in this second embodiment like numerals reference like parts-Party 12 sends an SMS message 26 intended for party 14 using their mobile phone.   The SMS message 26 is sent to the first destination address 18 by sending the SMS message 26 to a combination of associated shortcode 20 and the mobile phone number of party 14. The content of the SMS message 26 includes an amount to transfer to party 14 and the message intended for party 14.<br>
Telecommunications carrier 16 receives the SMS message 26 via the destination address. Upon receipt, telecommunications carrier 16 operates to amend the SMS message 26 to form a new SMS message 28. SMS message 28 includes the content of SMS message 26 (but with the amount to be transferred omitted) and an additional note. The additional note is intended to inform party 14 that their account with telecommunications carrier 16 has been incremented by the amount specified in SMS message 26." SMS message 28 is then sent to party's 14 mobile phone. The source address (ie. the phone number of the communication initiator) of the SMS message 28 is set to the mobile phone number of party 12.<br>
Also on receipt of the SMS message 26, the telecommunications carrier 16 operates to parse the SMS message 26 to identify the amount to be credited to party 14. The party's 14 credit balance with the telecommunications carrier 16 is then incremented by the amount specified.'<br><br>
As party 14 now has a positive credit balance with telecommunications carrier 16, party 14 can communicate with party 12 as desired. As a result, party 14 is charged as normal for any communication message they may send to party 12. Party 12, however, is charged for:<br>
•   their SMS message 26;<br>
•	the amount specified in SMS message 26; and<br>
•	any service charges levied by the telecommunications carrier 16.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention will now be described. The configuration of the third embodiment, like the second embodiment, is identical to that of the first embodiment already described. Accordingly, in this third embodiment, like numerals reference like parts.The exception is that shortcode 20 and shortcode 24 are the same in this example, and will hereafter be referred to simply as shortcode 20.<br>
Party 12 sends an SMS message 26 intended for party 14 using their mobile phone. The SMS message 26 is sent to the first destination address 18 by sending the SMS message 26 to associated shortcode 20. The SMS message 26 comprises a first keyword, such as "GIVE", the recipient's mobile phone number ie. the mobile phone number of party 14, and the message to" be forwarded to party 14.<br>
Telecommunications carrier 16 receives the SMS message 26 via the destination address.   Upon receipt, telecommunications carrier 16 operates to amend the SMS message 26 to form a new SMS message 28.  SMS message 28 includes the content of SMS message 26 (bar the first keyword and recipient's mobile phone number) and an additional note. The additional note is intended to inform party 14 that a reply to SMS message 28 wiil be passed to party 12 without charge by following a designated procedure (described below). SMS message 28 is then sent to party's 14 mobile phone.   The source address (ie. the phone number of the communication initiator) of the SMS message 23 is set to a<br><br>
combinatlon of associated shortcode 24 and the mobile phone number of party 12.<br>
In conjunction with forming SMS message 28, the telecommunications carrier 16 operates to establish a virtual credit account 30 (if not already established}. Virtual credit account 30 is associated with party 14 (by means of party's 14 mobile phone number). If virtual credit account 30 is already established, the value of the virtual credit account is incremented by one. Otherwise, the virtual credit account 30 is set to an initial value of 1.<br>
Party 14'then replies to SMS message 28 by means of further SMS message 32. This further SMS message 32 includes a second keyword, such as "FREE", to indicate that the message is not to be charged for.<br>
As further SMS message 32 is. sent in reply to SMS message 28, it is received by telecommunications carrier 16 at second destination address 22. Telecommunications carrier 15 processes the further SMS message 32 to identify the mobile phone number of the sender. The mobile phone number of the sender is then used as a reference for determining the associated virtual credit account 30. The associated virtual credit account 30 is then decremented by 1.<br>
The further SMS message 32 is then forwarded by telecommunications carrier.-16 to party 12 (minus the second keyword). The charges for each SMS message 26, 28, 32, plus any service charge levied by the telecommunications carrier 16, are all debited from party's 12 account with the telecommunications carrier 16.<br>
It should be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described. In particular, the inventions as described can include the following modifications and/or additions:<br>
•   The shortcodes 20, 24 associated with first destination address 18 and<br>
second destination address 22 may be changed. For example, the shortcodes 20, 24 can be identical or may be identical with a variant number being used to distinguish "crediting" calls from free responses.<br>
•	The role of telecommunications carrier 16 may be fulfilled by a third party not associated with a telecommunications carrier 16. such as a communication facilitator.<br>
•	While the system has been described in the context of a mobile phone, any communication device can be used. Accordingly, the communication messages, while expected to be predominantly SMS messages, can also be MMS messages or e-mail messages.<br>
•	The virtual account 30 may also be associated with the first party 12. In this manner, virtual account 30 may only be decremented when the second party 14 replies to the first party 12 and not when a reply is made in general. This also means that a second party 14 may have multiple-virtual credit accounts.<br>
•	The third embodiment may be modified so as in remove the need to enter an amount to be transferred. In such an arrangement, the amount to be transferred is an attribute of the associated shortcode 20 of the destination address 18 to which SMS message 26 is sent.<br>
•	Virtual account 30 may be omitted. In this arrangement, a response received from second party 14 will be considered a match to the immediately previous SMS message 26 received from first party 12.<br>
It should be further appreciated by the person skilled in the art that variations and-combinations of features described above, not being alternatives or substitutes, can be combined to form yet further embodiments falling within the intended scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
