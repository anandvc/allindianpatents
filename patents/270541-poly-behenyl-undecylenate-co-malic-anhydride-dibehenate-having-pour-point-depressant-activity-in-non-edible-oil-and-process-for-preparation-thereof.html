PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate having pour point depressant activity in non-edible oil and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Silicone fluid, synthetic hydrocarbon oils or petroleum based mineral oils, are conventionally used for insulating electrical components. However, over a period of time and with continuous exposure to high voltage electricity, the heat dissipating, insulating and dielectric characteristics of the above insulating fluids deteriorate. Moreover, they are not biodegradable and hence pose grave environmental problems. Mineral oil is also highly inflammable and is an unsuitable insulating medium for indoor and vault equipment installations. The environmental effects due to disposal of petroleum based products, oil spills and the fact that petroleum based products are non-renewable, have prompted interest in the use of vegetable oils as viable substitutes. However, in their natural state, vegetable oils have high viscosity which causes operational problems in transformers. Hence, all vegetable oils are transesterified prior to use as insulating fluids. The high cost of edible oils and the higher cost of preparing trans-esters of edible oils has discouraged the use of edible vegetable oils as substitutes for mineral oil. Karanjia oil is a non-edible vegetable oil which is relatively cheap and is generally used for making biodiesel. The term "non-edible oil" used hereinafter refers to mineral oil and/or vegetable oil.<br><br>
The pour point is the lowest temperature at which liquids can flow under standard conditions prescribed by ASTM D97. A pour point depressant (PPD) lowers that temperature. Pour point depressants are designed to control wax crystal formation in oils resulting in improved flow performance of the oil at lower temperatures, i.e, the PPDs lower the pour point of the oil. In cold climates, vegetable oils tend to solidify more readily than mineral oil i.e. vegetable oils have a relatively higher pour point than mineral oil. Addition of a pour point depressant to vegetable oils lowers the pour point of vegetable oils. Pour point depressants currently being used include, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, polymethacrylates, poly aery lates, alkyl esters of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, copolymers of olefins, acrylamides, polyacrylamides, copolymers of maleimide, maieic anhydrides, compounds of alkyl amines, alkyl ammonium salts, copolymers. of mono, dicarboxylic acids with monohydric, dihydric or polyhydric alcohols, branched polyalkyl methacrylates with functional group containing nitrogen, sulfone copolymers or copolymers of alpha olefins and maieic anhydride. However, many of these pour point depressants like polymethacrylates, polyacrylates and polyalkyl methacrylates are known to be nonbiodegradable, expensive and even carcinogenic.<br>

An object of the invention is to provide a bio-degradable, non-carcinogenic pour point depressant for non-edible oil.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a bio-degradable, non-carcinogenic pour point depressant for non-edible oil which is economical.<br><br>

Formula 1 wherein R represents behenyl group and n represents the number of repeating units,<br>
the process comprising:<br>
a)	esterifying a straight chain aliphatic unsaturated undecylenic acid with behenyl alcohol in the molar ratio of 2:1 in the presence of an organic solvent and sulphuric acid catalyst at 110°C to 140°C under azeotropic conditions to obtain an alkyl ester;<br>

The poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate obtained by the process of the invention has a molecular weight of 20,000 to 50,000. The molecular weight of poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate can be varied in the range of 20,000 to 50,000 by varying the process parameters such as the free radical initiator concentration, the stirring rate and the reaction time.<br>

process of the invention is also simple, easy and convenient to carry out and economical. Karanja oil is a low cost oil obtained from renewable natural resources. The addition of the pour point depressant of the above invention to karanja oil yields a low cost insulating medium which can replace mineral oil or even be used in combination with mineral oil to serve as an eco-friendly and efficient insulating medium.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof:<br>
Example 1 Undecylenic acid (0.051 M, 9.58 g) was esterified with behenyl alcohol (0.025 M, 8.491 g) at lire for 12 hours in the presence of toluene (75 ml) and sulphuric acid (0.2 ml) to obtain behenyl undecylenate. Water was eliminated from the reaction mixture by azeotropic distillation. The resulting crude ester was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer was separated and washed with water to remove traces of sodium bicarbonate and finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Solvent recovery was achieved by vacuum distillation.<br>
The behenyl undecylenate (0.025 M, 12.332 g) was copolymerized with double re-crystallized maleic anhydride (0.025 M, 2.451 g) in the presence of dry benzene under dry nitrogen atmosphere with azobisisobutyronitrile (1% by weight of total reactant weight) at 55 to 60°C with constant stirring for 5 hours to give poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride) which was purified by repeated solvent non-solvent precipitation (benzene-methanol) method. Traces of the solvent were removed by drying under reduced pressure at 50°C / 25mm Hg for 5 hours.<br><br>
The poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride) (0.019 M, 8.02 gm) was diesterified with 2 moles of behenyl alcohol (0.032 M, 6.04 gm) in the presence of xylene (60 ml) and para-toluene sulfonic acid (0.1 gm) and sulphuric acid (0.1 ml) at 140°C to produce poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate which was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate and separated and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Solvent was recovered by vacuum distillation. The crude diester was purified by repeated precipitation in excess acetone and dried under vacuum at 40°C/25mm Hg for 5 hours. The poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate obtained in this example had a molecular weight of 35,841.<br>
Example 2<br>
100 ppm and 500 ppm of poly (behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate<br>
obtained in Example 1 was added to karanja oil. The standard method as prescribed by the ASTM D97 was used for determining the pour point of karanja oil on addition of varying amounts of poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-maleic anhydride)dibehenate and the results were as shown in the following Table 1 :<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Pour point depressant (PPD) comprising:	Pour point of virgin karanja oil	Pour point of karanja oil after<br>
addition of PPD	Extent of depression in pour point<br><br><br>
	100 ppm of PPD	500 ppm of PPD	100 ppm of PPD	500 ppm of PPD<br>
Poly(behenyl undecylenate-co-mal ei c anhydride) dibehenate	12 °C	6°C	-12°C	6°C	24°C<br><br>
