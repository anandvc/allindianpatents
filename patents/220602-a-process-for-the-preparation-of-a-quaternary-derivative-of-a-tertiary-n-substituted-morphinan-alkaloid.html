The present invention generally relates to a process for the preparation of a quaternary derivative of a tertiary n-substituted morphinan alkaloid.<br>
N-methyl quaternary derivatives of morphinan alkaloids such as naltrexone {(Sa^lZ-icyclopropylmethylH^-epoxy-SJ^clihydroxymorphinan-e-one sometimes referred to as N-cyclopropylmethyl-noroxymorphone) and naloxone ((5a)-4(5-epoxy-3,14-d!hydroxy-17-(2-propenyi)morphinan-6-one sometimes referred to as N-allykioroxymorphone) have useful pharmacological properties as potent antagonists of the mu receptor. They bind to peripheral receptors primarily located in the gastrointestinal tract, act as antagonists and effectively mitigate some of the undesirable side effects of opiate therapy such as constipation and nausea.. Because of their ionic charge, however, they do not traverse the blood brain barrier into the central nervous system; hence, the central activity of opiates responsible for pain relief is not blocked in the presence of these quaternary derivatives.<br>
In U.S. Patent no. 4,176,186. Goldberg, et al. generally describe the preparation of quaternary derivatives of certain morphinan alkaloids by quatemizing a tertiary N-substituted morphinan alkaloid with a methylating agent such as methyl bromide, methyl iodide or dimethylsulfate. Goldberg et al. disclose that the methylating agent itself may be used as the solvent or, alternatively, another solvent medium such as methanol, ethanol, or other alcohols, methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetronitrile, nitromethane or hexamethylphosphoric triamide may be used- Goldberg et al. state that they especially prefer acetone and, in their Example 5, they dissolve N-cyclopropylmethylnoroxy-morphone in a mixture consisting of 50 ml of absolute acetone and 0.5 ml of dimethylformamide and then admix the resulting solution with methyl bromide. Methyl bromide was used in excess, greater than six-fold molar excess relative to the free base, over a period of 3 weeks in a pressure vessel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Among the various aspects of the present invention is an improved process for the preparation and/or recovery of quaternary morphinan alkaloids,<br><br>
Briefly, therefore, the present invention is a process for the preparation of a quaternary derivative of the morphinan alkaloid. The process comprises contacting a tertiary N-substituted morphinan alkaloid with an alkyl halide in an anhydrous solvent system, wherein the solvent system comprises an aprotic dipolar solvent with the aprotic dipolar solvent constituting at least 25 wt% of the solvent system.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a process for separating a liquid mixture containing a 3-alkoxymorphinan alkaloid and a 3-hydroxymorphinan alkaloid. The process comprises contacting the mixture with a strong base, thereby converting the 3-hydroxy morphinan alkaloid to a salt, precipitating the salt but not the 3-alkoxymorphinan alkaloid from the liquid, and separating the salt precipitate from the 3-alkoxymorphinan alkaloid.<br>
Other objects and features of this invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.<br>

In each of these embodiments in which a ternary alkaloid base is alkylated to form the corresponding N-alkyl quaternary alkaloid salt represented by Formula 1 A, 2A, 2A\ 2A'\ 3A, or 4A, Z is preferably hydroxy, alkoxy or acyloxy, more preferably hydroxy or methoxy. For example, in each of these embodiments Z may be selected from -OCH3I -OAc, -OTHP, -OSiR3 (wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl, preferably lower alkyl), -OBn, -OBz, -OBs, -OTs, or -OMs. • In each of these embodiments, Y, if present, is preferably hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy or acyloxy, more preferably hydrogen or hydroxy. For example, in each of these embodiments Y, if present, may be selected from -OCHa) -OAc, -OTHP, -OSiR3 (wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl, preferably lower alkyl), -OBn, -OBz, -OBs, -OTs, and -OMs. In each of these embodiments, R1 is preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, allyl (-CH2CH=CH2), chloroallyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, or propargyl. In each of these embodiments, R2 is preferably alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl, more preferably lower alkyl, and typically methyl. In each of these embodiments, Xa is preferably a halide or an anion such as iodide, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, or phosphate for the halide anion. If Xe is a halide, it is preferably bromide.<br><br>
In general, the N-alkyl quaternary derivative of the ternary alkaloid base is prepared by contacting the base with an alkyl halide in an anhydrous solvent system. Relatively concentrated solutions are preferred. That is, the reaction mixture preferably comprises no more than about 2 equivalents of solvent for each equivalent of ternary alkaloid base to solvent In some embodiments, the reaction mixture comprises no more than about 1.75 equivalents of solvent for. each equivalent of ternary alkaloid base. In other embodiments, the reaction mixture comprises no more than about 1.5 equivalents of solvent for each equivalent of ternary alkaloid base.<br>
A range of alkylating agents may be used in the process of the present invention. In general, alkylating agents comprising 1 to 8 carbons, optionally substituted and optionally unsaturated are preferred. Thus, for example, the alkylating agent may be a methyl, ethyl, propyl, ailyl, cyclopropyl, or benzyl halide. While alkyl chlorides and alkyl iodides may be used, it is generally preferred that the alkyl halide be an alkyl bromide. Relative to the corresponding alkyl bromides, under certain conditions alkyiations with alkyl chlorides tend to proceed slowly and alkyl iodides tend to lead to over alkylation of the ternary alkaloid substrates. In one embodiment, for example, the alkylating agent is methyl, ethyl, propyl, allyl, cyclopropyl or benzyl bromide. Preferably, it is methyl bromide.<br>
The solvent system for the N-alkylation comprises an aprotic, dipolar solvent and is anhydrous. That is, the solvent system comprises less than about 0.5 wt.% water, typically less than about 0.2 wt.% water, still more typically less than 0.1 wt.% water, and in some embodiments, less than 0.05 wt.% water. In addition, it is preferred that the aprotic, dipolar solvent constitute a significant fraction of the solvent system; for example, in one embodiment the aprotic, dipolar solvent constitutes at least about 25 wt% of the solvent system. In another embodiment, the aprotic, dipolar solvent constitutes at least about 50 wt% of the solvent system. In a further embodiment, the aprotic, dipolar solvent constitutes at least about 75 wt% of the solvent system. In a further embodiment, the aprotic, dipolar solvent constitutes at least about 90 wt% of the solvent system. Exemplary aprotic dipolar solvents include dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile, hexamethylphosphor-amide ("HMPA"), and mixtures thereof. N-methylpyrriolidinone (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) is typically preferred, either alone or in combination with another aprotic, dipolar solvent. In addition to the aprotic dipolar solvent (or mixture of aprotic dipolar solvents), the solvent system may additionally comprise other<br><br>
solvents such as acetone, ether, hydrocarbon, toluene, benzene, ana halobenzene.<br>
The reaction may be carried out over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Surprisingly, however, it has been discovered that when methyl bromide gas is dissolved in anhydrous 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, the methyl bromide is predominantly retained at temperatures of 85 °C at relatively modest elevated pressures (e.g., * 2 atmosphere,  10 atm) over 24 hours.<br>
The product is obtained after completion of reaction by cooling the reaction to room temperature. In one embodiment, an aprotic solvent of lower polarity in which the product is not soluble is added to the reaction mixture to increase "flowability" and to enhance precipitatiorr. The resulting mixture is preferably stirred, vacuum filtered and dried to yield a crude product. In a preferred embodiment, the aprotic solvent of low polarity used is selected from acetone, ether, or hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene.<br>
In general and regardless of synthetic route, N-alkylations of morphinan substrates that contain a 3-hydroxy moiety may yield undesirable 3-alkoxymorphinans. Crude product mixtures containing 3-hydroxy and 3-alkoxymorphinans maybe purified by adding strong base, e.g., sodium methoxide, NaOH, or KOH in methanol/water, heating the mixture to convert the 3-hydroxymorphinan to its salt (e.g., sodium salt), adding additional methanol, cooling to precipitate the salt, filtering and drying. Advantageously, the 3-alkoxymorphinan remains in solution and does not precipitate along with the salt; as a result, the salt and the 3-alkoxymorphinan may be readily separated.<br>
The desired N-alkyl morphinan may be regenerated from the salt by redissolving the salt (for example, in a methanol/water solution), adjusting the solution to a tow pH (for example, a pH of 0.5 to 1 using 45% hydrobromic acid) to regenerate a hydroxy group at the 3-position, and precipitating the product. In a preferred embodiment, the precipitated product is recovered by vacuum filtration, washing with additional methanol and drying to 75°C.<br><br>
MSlhen the alkylating agent is an alkyl halide, the N-alkyl morphinan alkaloid will contain a halide anion. This anion may be exchanged at various stages in the process by treating the N-alkyl morphinan alkaloid with a protic acid, thereby exchanging an anion such as iodide, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, or phosphate for the halide anion.<br>
As described in greater details in the Examples, purification of crude product from the synthesis described above is capable of yielding N-aikyl product of 99.5% purity by HPLC relative to an analytical standard.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of N-Cyclopropylmethyl-Noroxymorphone MethoBromide: Bromomethane in 1-methyl-2-pyrroIidinone<br>
A 3-necked 500-mL flask was fitted with an addition funnel, thermocouple, condenser and a mechanical stirrer. 100 mL of l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was added to the flask under a sweep of dry nitrogen and was heated to 55°C. The addition funnel was replaced with a powder funnel, 100 gm<br><br>
of naltrexone anhydrous base was added with stirring, the funnel was "washed down" with 25 mL of 1-methyl-2-pyirolidinone and the temperature was adjusted , to 55-58°C. The addition funnel was placed back on the 3-necked flask. Separately, 25 mL of anhydrous 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was cooled in a graduated cylinder. Methyl bromide gas was condensed in a lecture bottle using an ice bath and 25 mL was measured out as a liquid into another cold graduated cylinder. The cold methyl bromide liquid and 1-methyI-2-pyrrolidinone were combined and mixed. The methyl bromide solution was poured into the addition funnel and then added dropwise to the naltrexone base under a slow sweep of dry nitrogen. The reaction temperature was increased to 61-65°C. A mild exotherm was noted.<br>
After about one hour, a fine white suspension of N-naltrexone methyl bromide could be observed which increased throughout the 8 hour reaction time. The mixture was then cooled to 20-55°C. Acetone was poured into the suspension to facilitate the precipitation of soluble product. The slurry was cooled to ice bath temperature and stirred for 1 to 2 hours. The product was recovered by vacuum filtration and washed with 75 mL of additional acetone. The product was dried in a convection oven to a constant weight. The crude weight yield was 80 to 85 g with a HPLC assay of 90-93% area % purity.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Purification procedure for products from N-alkylations: N-Cyciopropylmethyl-Noroxymorphone MethoBromide<br>
The undesirable phenolic (O-alkyI) side-products were removed by first converting the O-alkyI impurity in crude N-naltrexone methyl bromide into its sodium alkoxide salt utilizing a strong base, e.g., 40 mL of 25% sodium methoxide in methanol/water(220 mL/120 mL). The solution was heated to 50-65°C with an additional 500 mL of methanol. The solution was cooled to 20-25°C for 60-90 min. The sodium salt crystallized on stirring and was recovered by vacuum filtration. After drying at 60°C under nitrogen, the sodium salt weighed 53-55 g.<br>
The product was regenerated by adjusting the pH of a methanol/water (100 mL, ratio 5:7.5) sodium salt solution to 0.5-1 with 25 g of 45% hydrobromic acid. The solution was filtered, 150 mL of methanol added, the temperature was adjusted to 50-55°C and finally cooled to ice-bath temperature. The white<br><br>
precipitated product was recovered by vacuum filtration and washed with 75 mL of methanol. After drying to 75°C, the purified product weighed -45 g. The product was 99.5% pure by HPLC assessment relative to an analytical standard. The procedure described above is applicable to other N-alkyiations.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Synthesis of N-Cyclopropylmethyl-Noroxymorphone MethoBromide: Bromomethane in N^-dimethylformamide (DMF)<br>
Naltrexone base (40.0 grams) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (50 mL Mallinckrodt, AR) with mild heating and then purged with dry house nitrogen. Methyl bromide (5 mL, Aldrich) cooled to ice bath temperature was measured out into a cold (-5 °C) 10 mL graduated cylinder and quickly added to the reaction flask. With the bubbler left in place, the glass flask was heated to 65 °C for ten hours. The crude product was recovered from the DMF by precipitation with acetone (75 mL, Mallinckrodt AR) after a short reflux period. A white solid was isolated by vacuum filtration and washed with acetone (Mallinckrodt AR). The crude product (22.7 g) was dissolved in methanol(Mallinckrodt AR)/deionized water (110 mL, 80/20), charcoal-treated (0.5 g, DARCO KB-B, Ba# M-1014) and then allowed to crystallize. The salt like product (17,2 g) was recrystallized again from methanol/deionized water (90 mL). The product, naltrexone methobromide, weighed 12.3 grams after drying in a vacuum oven overnight. HPLC analysis indicated that no Omethylated products were left. The starting base was the only remaining impurity at a concentration of 0.64 wt/wt. The product assayed at 99.36 wt./wt.%.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Synthesis of N-Cyclopropylmethyl-Noroxymorphone Methobromide: Bromomethane in 1-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidinone (NMP)<br>
To a 3-necked 250 mL flask fitted with a thermocouple, addition funnel, condenser and a mechanical stirrer, was added 50 mL of fresh anhydrous 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (Aldrich) under a sweep of dry nitrogen. The solution was heated to 55°C. The addition funnel was replaced with a powder funnel and anhydrous naltrexone base (39.5 grams) was added with stirring. After the<br><br>
