DESCRIPTION SKIN EXTERNAL PREPARATION CONTAINING TRITERPENIC ACID<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to a skin external preparation, such as a cosmetic, or a medicine for external application to skin, containing a triterpenic acid.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]      Triterpenic acids including ursolic acid are known to have various physiological activities such as antioxidant effect, anti-inflammatory effect, melanin production inhibitory effect, and collagen reconstruction effect, and there are known techniques for using a triterpenic acid as an Act i vp&gt; i ngrpHi ent nf thR skin external preparation such as cosmetics (for example, Patent Documents 1, 2, 3 and 4). However, the triterpenic acid has poor solubility in an oily component and an aqueous component, and has a problem of precipitation of the triterpenic acid when the preparation is stored for a long period of time.  Lack of storage stability of the skin external preparation containing the triterpenic acid is not preferred, because the above-mentioned physiological activities are reduced.  Under such circumstances, there has been studied a method of improving solubility of the<br>
 <br>
triterpenic acid in the oily component through derivatization of the triterpenic acid into an ester or ether [Patent Document 5) . The method provides an effect of improving the solubility of the triterpenic acid in some degree, but the effect is not enough to prevent the precipitation of the triterpenic acid when the preparation is stored for a long period of time.  In order to solve such problems, a technique of using aliphatic saturated alcohols having 12 to 24 carbon atoms or the like in combination has been developed (Patent Document 6). The technique provides the effect of improving the solubility of the triterpenic acid in some degree, but in the case where a preparation containing a triterpenic acid at a concentration of as high as 0.1% by mass or more is stored for a long period of time under a low-temperature condition, there may c?n=;
[0003]     Meanwhile, 4-n-butylresorcinol is known to have a strong inhibitory effect of tyrosinase activity and to act as a very effective skin-whitening agent (Patent Document 7), and is used as a material of cosmetics.  However, it has not been known that a 4-alkylresorcinol such as 4-n-butylresorcinol has the effect to enhance long-term storage stability of the<br>
 <br>
triterpenic acid. Also, it has not been known that a 4-alkylresorcinol can be actually blended with the triterpenic acid in the skin external preparation. [0004]      Patent Document 1: JP 8-165231 A<br>

[0005]      An object of the present invention is to provide techniques for enhancing solubility and improving storage c^tahility of ^ tri terneni c.   acid and/or a derivative thereof (hereinafter, also referred to as triterpenic acid or the like) in a preparation containing the triterpenic acid or the like.  In particular, an object of the present invention is to provide means for improving long-term storage stability and stability under a low-temperature storage condition of a preparation containing the triterpenic acid or the like at a concentration of as high as, for example, 0.1% by mass or more [0006]      The inventors of the present invention found that addition of a 4-alkylresorcinol such as 4-n-butylresorcinol<br>
 <br>
and/or a salt thereof (hereinafter, also referred to as 4-alkylresorcinol or the like) to a skin external preparation containing a triterpenic acid or the like such as benzyl ursolate at a relatively high concentration can prevent precipitation of the triterpenic acid or the like even when the preparation is stored for a long period of time under the low-temperature condition, thus completing the present invention. That is, the present invention relates to the following technologies.<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
[0008]       Triterpenic acid and/or derivative thereof as essential component of the skin external preparation of the present invention<br>
A skin external preparation of the present invention contains a triterpenic acid and/or a derivative thereof (component 1) .  The triterpenic acid is not particularly limited as long as the triterpenic acid can be used in the field of skin external preparations such as cosmetics. Preferable examples thereof include ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, betulinic acid, and asiatic acid ( (2a, 3(3, 4a)-2, 3, 23-trihydroxyurs-12-en-ursolic acid,  (2a,3|3,4a)-2,3,23-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid).  Of those, the ursolic acid is particularly preferably exemplified.<br>
 <br>
[0009]      The triterpenic acid can be obtained in accordance with a conventional metnodr and may be extracted from a plan" or may be a commercially-available product.  For example, ursolic acid is contained in fruits of bearberry, apple, and cherry, leaves of various plants, etc.; oleanolic acid is contained in olive leaves, apple peels, clove buds, etc.; betulinic acid is contained in dogwood barks, pomegranate peels, jujube, etc.; and asiatic acid is contained in Indian Pennywort, etc. Therefore, the triterpenic acid can be used by concentrating and purifying extracts of those plants. Meanwhile, examples of the commercialized product of ursolic acid include Ursolic Acid (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.); examples of the commercialized product of oleanolic acid include Oleanolic Acid {manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Corporation); examples of the commercialized product of betulinic acid include Betulinic Acid (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation); and examples of the commercialized product of asiatic acid include Asiatic Acid (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation). [0010]      The derivative of the triterpenic acid is not particularly limited as long as the derivative of the triterpenic acid has the physiological activity of the triterpenic acid.  Specific examples of the derivative of the triterpenic acid include salts of triterpenic acid, esters of triterpenic acid, amides of triterpenic acid, and ethers of<br>
 <br>
triterpenic acid.  Salts of triterpenic acid and esters of triterpenic acid are preferably exemplified in the skin external preparation of the present invention.  Preferable examples of the esters include methyl ursolate, ethyl ursolate, propyl ursolate, butyl ursolate, benzyl ursolate, methyl oleanolate, ethyl oleanolate, propyl oleanolate, butyl oleanolate, benzyl oleanolate, methyl betulinate, ethyl betulinate, propyl betulinate, butyl betulinate, benzyl betulinate, methyl asiatate, ethyl asiatate, propyl asiatate, butyl asiatate, and benzyl asiatate.  Of those, benzyl ursolate is particularly preferred.  This is because the benzyl ursolate is excellent in storage stability and also, high physiological activity of ursolic acid can be obtained.  In addition, the salt of triterpenic acid can be used without particular limlLciLiua as long as the salt is physiologically permitted. Examples of the salt include alkali metal salts such as a sodium salt and a potassium salt, alkali earth metal salts such as a calcium salt and a magnesium salt, ammonium salts, organic amine salts such as a trlethyl amine salt and a triethanol amine salt, and basic amino acid salts such as an arginine salt and a lysine salt.<br>
[0011]      The derivative of the triterpenic acid can be produced in accordance with a conventional method.  For example, a benzyl ester of a triterpenic acid can be produced by:<br>
 <br>
converting the triterpenic acid into a triethylamine salt; and reacting the resultant salt with benzyl chloride.  Meanwhile, esters of a triterpenic acid can be obtained by a reaction of the triterpenic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst.<br>
[0 012]      The skin external preparation of the present invention may contain one of the triterpenic acids and derivatives thereof alone or may contain two or more of them in combination.<br>
The content of the triterpenic acid or the like in the skin external preparation of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the physiological activity of the triterpenic acid or the like can be obtained. Even in the case of the skin external preparation of the present invention containing a triterpenic acid or the like at a content of 0.1% by mass or more in total, precipitation of crystals is suppressed, resulting in high stability.  Therefore, the excellent effect of the present invention can be achieved in the skin external preparation containing a triterpenic acid or the like at a content of 0.1% by mass to 5% by mass, preferably 0.2% by mass to 3% by mass, more preferably 0.3% by mass to 3% by mass in total.<br>
[0013]       4-alkylresorcinol and/or salt thereof as essential component of the skin external preparation of the<br>
 <br>
present invention<br>
The skin external preparation of the present invention is characterized by containing a 4-alkylresorcinol and/or a salt thereof (component 2).  The alkyl group in the 4-alkylresorcinol is preferably an alkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably an alkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms.  Specific examples of the alkyl group include n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, octyl, and isooctyl groups.  The skin external preparation of the present invention particularly preferably contains 4-n-butylresorcinol.  The 4-alkylresorcinol such as 4-n-butylresorcinol is a known substance and can be produced in accordance with a conventional method such as the method described in Lille, J. ; BiLLer, L.A.; Feiner, V. Trudy-Nauchono-Issledovatel' ^'kii Institut Slantsev (1969), No.18, 127-34. That is, examples of a method of producing 4-n-butylresorcinol includes: a method including condensing resorcin and butanoic acid in the presence of zinc chloride and reducing the resultant product with zinc amalgam/hydrochloric acid; and a method including condensing resorcin and n-butyl alcohol at 200 to 400°C.  In this method, if another n-hexyl alcohol or the like is substituted for n-butyl alcohol, another 4-alkylresorcinol can be synthesized.  In addition, 4-n-hexylresorcinol is<br>
 <br>
commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., and the product may be purchased and used.<br>
[0014]      In addition, the salts of 4-alkylresorcinol may be generally used in cosmetics and physiologically permitted. Examples of the salt include salts of alkali metals such as sodium and potassium, salts of alkali earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, ammonium salts, salts of organic amines such as triethyl amine and triethanol amine, and salts of basic amino acid such as lysine and arginine. [0015]     The skin external preparation of the present invention may contain one of the 4-alkylresorcinols and salts thereof alone or may contain two or more of them in combination.<br>
The content of the 4-alkylresorcinol or the like in the c:Vi n external nreparati nn of the present invention is preferably 0.01% by mass or more, more preferably 0.05% by mass or more, further preferably 0.1% by mass or more in total with respect to the total amount of the preparation.  The upper limit is preferably 3% by mass or less, more preferably 1% by mass or less, further preferably 0.5% by mass or less.  The reason is that if the content is too low, the effect of the present invention may not be exerted, while if the content is too high, the effect may reach a plateau. [0016]      The content ratio of a triterpenic acid and/or a<br>
 <br>
derivative thereof to a 4-alkylresorcinol and/or a salt thereof is preferably 5:1 to 1:10^ more preferably 5:1 to 1:5. [0017]      Branched fatty acid as preferable component of the skin external preparation of the present invention<br>
The skin external preparation of the present invention preferably further contains a branched fatty acid in addition to the above-mentioned essential components.  The fatty acid further improves long-term storage stability of the skin external preparation of the present invention.  The branched fatty acid is preferably a branched fatty acid having 12 to 30 carbon atoms, particularly preferably isostearic acid.  The branched fatty acid may be contained as a free carboxylic acid or as a salt. The salt may be generally used in a cosmetic and is physiologically acceptable.  Preferable examples thereof include: salts of alkaline metals such as sodium and potassium;- salts of alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium; ammonium salts; salts of organic amines such as triethylamine and triethanolamine; and salts of basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine. Although the content of the branched fatty acid is not particularly limited, the content is 0.1 to 30% by mass, preferably 1 to 10% by mass. [0018]       Skin external preparation of the present invention<br>
The skin external preparation of the present invention<br>
 <br>
contains a triterpenic acid or the like that is poorly soluble in water, and the preparation is preferably in an oil-based formulation containing an oily component or a polyol as a main component, or in an essence-type formulation containing a large amount of polyols. Meanwhile, a 4-alkylresorcinol or the like is soluble both in an oily component and water, and the preparation is preferably in the form of an emulsion containing an aqueous component including water and an oily component.<br>
[0019]      Although the skin external preparation of the present invention may be applied to any of preparations for cosmetics and medicines for external application to skin, the skin external preparation is particularly suitably used for cosmetics.  In the case of using 4-n-butylresorcinol or the like, Lhe preparation is more desirably applied to cosmetics, in particular, quasi-drugs.<br>
In addition, the skin external preparation of the present invention can be used for the purposes of treatment, prevention, or amelioration of specific skin diseases or symptoms, depending on various physiological activities of the triterpenic acid or the like.  For example, the skin external preparation containing ursolic acid or a derivative of ursolic acid such as   benzyl ursolate has ability to reconstruct collagen fiber bundles; therefore, the preparation can be used<br>
 <br>
as an anti-wrinkle cosmetic.  The skin external preparation containing oleanolic acid or a derivative thereof has ability to ameliorate acne skin; therefore, the preparation can be used as a cosmetic for acne skin or oily skin.<br>
[0020]     The skin external preparation of the present invention may contain an optional component that is generally used in the skin external preparation in addition to the above-mentioned essential components.  Such an optional component is not particularly limited as long as the component does not inhibit the effect of the present invention.  Examples thereof include hydrocarbons, silicones, esters, fatty acids, triglycerides, polyols, organic powders, inorganic powders, surfactants, thickeners, vitamins, steroids, antiseptic agents, and ultraviolet absorbers. Those optional components may be blended in amounts not enough to inhibit the effect of the present invention.<br>

Samples were left to stand in a low temperature aging box (the samples were stored at -10°C for 24 hours, heated to 5°C over 24 hours, stored at 5°C for 24 hours, and cooled to -10°C over 24 hours; the procedure was defined as   one cycle and repeated) for three months and returned to the state of room temperature, and 0.10 g of each of the creams of Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 was collected and spread on black plates using a spatul a.  Then, the fine precJ.pitates contained in the samples were observed and counted under a microscope. The term ^^fine precipitates" refers to crystals that can be observed under a microscope and have sizes of about 5 to 50 }am, Note that the fine precipitates having such sizes are not large enough to give a feel to the skin when cosmetics or the like are used, but such crystals may grow to those having larger sizes. Therefore, in the skin external preparation containing a triterpenic acid, it is important to suppress appearance of such fine precipitates.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0040]      In the case of the sample containing benzyl ursolate and 4-n~butylresorcinol prepared in Example 1, fine precipitates were not observed.  On the other hand, in the case of the sample containing benzyl ursolate and not containing 4-n-butylresorcinol prepared in Comparative Example 1, many fine precipitates were observed.  In the cases of the sample not containing benzyl ursolate and containing 4-n-butylresorcinol prepared in Comparative Example 2 and the sample not containing both of benzyl ursolate and 4-n-butylresorcinol prepared in Comparative Example 3, no fine precipitates were observed.<br>
The results revealed that 4-n-butylresorcinol could enhance dissolution stability of benzyl ursolate.  That is, it was found that the skin external preparation of the present invention was excellent in storage stability under a low-temperature condition.<br>
