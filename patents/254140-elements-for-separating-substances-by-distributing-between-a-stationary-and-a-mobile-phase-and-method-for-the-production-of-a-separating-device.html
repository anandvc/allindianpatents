				<td>Elements for separating substances by distributing<br>
between a stationary and a mobile phase, and method for<br>
the production of a separating device<br>
The present invention relates to elements for<br>
separating substances by distributing between a<br>
stationary and a mobile phase, in particular for<br>
chromatography, and a method of production of the<br>
separating device comprising the stationary phase, in<br>
particular a chromatographic column.<br>
Chromatography is, a physicochemical method of<br>
separation, in which the substances to be separated are<br>
distributed between two phases, one of which, the<br>
stationary phase, is fixed, whereas the other, mobile<br>
phase moves in a defined direction.<br>
The stationary phase is one of the two phases<br>
comprising the chromatographic system. A solid phase<br>
(sorbent), a liquid phase (solvent) or a gel can be<br>
used as the stationary phase. In the case of the liquid<br>
phase, this is applied to a solid (support), which may<br>
also be involved in the separating process. In the case<br>
of a bound phase, the layer with separating properties<br>
is bound chemically to a support or to the inside<br>
surface of a capillary.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the<br>
stationary phases also include the quasistationary<br>
phases in liquid-liquid chromatography.<br>
In order to protect the separating column against<br>
contaminants during chromatographic separation, the<br>
separating column is sometimes preceded by a precolumn.<br><br>
In general the precolumn is filled with the same<br>
stationary phase as the separating column, or a<br>
material with lower retention is used.<br>
In isocratic analysis the composition of the mobile<br>
phase remains constant throughout the elution<br>
operation.<br>
In contrast, in gradient elution, the composition of<br>
the mobile phase is varied continuously or<br>
alternatively stepwise (step gradient).<br>
In practice, substances of different polarities are<br>
often separated chromatographically over a wide range<br>
of polarity by gradient elution, as selective<br>
separation can be achieved in this way. In this case, a<br>
more polar mobile phase is added continuously or<br>
stepwise to an initially usually nonpolar mobile phase<br>
(normal-phase chromatography) or a less polar mobile<br>
phase is added to one that is more polar (reversed-<br>
phase chromatography).<br>
For formation of the mobile phase by means of a<br>
gradient, chromatographs are required for gradient<br>
elution with at least two pumps for the different<br>
solvents or at least one low-pressure mixer and control<br>
software. The robustness of gradient separation is<br>
always poorer than that of isocratic separation.<br>
Another disadvantage of gradient elution is that after<br>
elution with e.g. an increasingly more polar solvent<br>
mixture, the chromatographic system must be brought<br>
back again to the initial thermodynamic equilibrium<br>
with respect to the initially nonpolar mobile phase in<br>
the next elution, namely by extensive rinsing with the,<br>
in this example, nonpolar phase, before the column can<br><br>
be used for the next gradient elution. This<br>
"backwashing" is generally carried out with fifteen to<br>
twenty times the column volume and leads to a<br>
prolongation of the total cycle time and a considerable<br>
consumption of solvents.<br>
Thus, separation of a large number of samples that are<br>
to be verified and separated by gradient elution, for<br>
example in quality control, has the disadvantage of the<br>
prolonged total cycle time, whereas for routine<br>
investigations of a large number of samples, the time<br>
per analysis with good separation should of course be<br>
as short as possible for economic reasons.<br>
A further disadvantage of gradient elution is that the<br>
varying composition of the mobile phase means that<br>
certain detection principles cannot be employed. For<br>
example, the use of detectors based on measurement of<br>
refractive index is essentially ruled out when the<br>
composition of the mobile phase varies.<br>
Even the UV/VIS detectors that are generally used are<br>
greatly restricted in their range of application in<br>
gradient elution on account of many admixed solvents<br>
and additives, e.g. methanol, THF, TFA, formic acid,<br>
acetic acid etc., which are themselves strongly<br>
absorbing in the UV range 
Even with mass spectrometers, which have been used as<br>
universal detectors in recent times, secondary effects<br>
occur in gradient elution, e.g. problems of ionization<br>
in different chemical environments, making quantitative<br>
analysis much more difficult.<br>
There are also ecological disadvantages in separation<br>
of substances by gradient elution: the mobile phase<br><br>
contained in a mixture after elution can only be<br>
recycled with difficulty, if at all, necessitating<br>
expensive disposal of the solvent mixture and<br>
additional costs for supply of the (fresh) solvents for<br>
forming the gradient. Moreover, gradient elution<br>
requires the use of far more expensive solvents, of<br>
higher purity, than the isocratic technique.<br>
Furthermore, backwashing of the separating column also<br>
requires appreciable amounts of solvents, which cannot<br>
be recycled.<br>
When in practice, also within the scope of preliminary<br>
tests, the user first develops, from columns with<br>
different stationary phases, the column with the most<br>
suitable stationary phase (such columns are supplied as<br>
test columns), optimization of the separation technique<br>
in practice is ultimately based on optimization of the<br>
mobile phase, namely through selection of the type of<br>
solvents, the pH value of the mobile phase, further<br>
additives etc., which then lead to improved separation.<br>
It is simpler, however, to achieve	defined<br>
selectivities by skillful selection of the	correct<br>
stationary phase. A situation that often	arises,<br>
however, is that as soon as separation is achieved<br>
between a particular critical pair of peaks,	another<br>
pair of peaks merge into one peak elsewhere in the<br>
chromatogram.<br>
To prevent this, it was proposed to use, as stationary<br>
phase, a mixture of suitable stationary phases (mixed<br>
bed) , with which, for a specific separation problem in<br>
isocratic analysis, a selective separation can often be<br>
achieved.<br><br>
G.J. Eppert and P. Heitmann proposed, in LC.GC Europe,<br>
p. 2, October 2003, optimization of mixed-bed columns<br>
based on first determining, using three or four test<br>
columns of different selectivity, the retention times<br>
of a test substance mixture, and then calculating a<br>
suitable mixed-bed column for the specific separation<br>
problem.<br>
However, these stationary phases as mixed bed have the<br>
disadvantage that the column manufacturer must be<br>
commissioned to pack a corresponding mixed-bed column<br>
for each new separation problem. Thus, in the short<br>
term, the user is quite unable to carry out an<br>
isocratic analysis with the desired selectivity. The<br>
column cannot be packed by the user, who does not have<br>
the necessary special equipment, and lacks the relevant<br>
know-how. Moreover, it is also relatively difficult to<br>
pack a mixed bed in a separating column with good<br>
reproducibility.<br>
It is known, from multidimensional chromatography, to<br>
provide columns branching from a main column, to be<br>
connected at different times, so that individual<br>
fractions are then "branched off" from the main column<br>
at a defined point of time via the temporarily<br>
connected column. Ultimately, separation of the mixture<br>
in multidimensional chromatography only takes place to<br>
a certain extent on the stationary phase of the<br>
separating device, and the main separation is achieved<br>
by switching to an additional separating device with an<br>
additional supply of eluent.<br>
Even if good separations can be achieved with<br>
multidimensional chromatography, it is very expensive,<br>
fault-prone and is only suitable for routine<br>
measurements at considerable cost.<br><br>
To solve special separation problems such as the<br>
separation of a 20-component amino acid mixture, J.L.<br>
Glajch et al. proposed, in "Journal of Chromatography",<br>
318 (1985), page 23, improving the selectivity by<br>
combining stationary phases along with four mobile<br>
phases. However, this arrangement is based on purely<br>
empirical tests and has therefore not been calculated<br>
specifically.<br>
For optimization of the mobile phase in liquid<br>
chromatography, Sz. Nyiredy, B. Meier, C.A.J.<br>
Erdelmeier, 0. Sticher proposed, in "High Resolution<br>
Chromatogr. &amp; Chromatogr. Communications" 8, (1985),<br>
the so-called "prism" model. In this, the solvent<br>
strength is plotted vertically, and the two-dimensional<br>
representation of the proportions of the components,<br>
which mainly influence the selectivity, is plotted in a<br>
horizontal plane.<br>
Later, in column liquid chromatography, the overall<br>
optimum of the mobile phase was predicted from fifteen<br>
individual measurements and the local optimum of the<br>
mobile phase from twelve individual measurements (Sz.<br>
Nyiredy, W. Wosniok, H. Thiele, 0. Sticher "Fluid<br>
Chromatogr." 14, 3077 (1991)).<br>
This model was also employed for optimization of the<br>
extractants in liquid-liquid extraction, and in this<br>
case optimized extractants could be determined from<br>
twelve measured values (Sz. Nyiredy "Chromatographia"<br>
51, 288 (2000)).<br>
The present invention is based on the problem of<br>
providing a device and a method with which a<br>
chromatographic separation problem can be solved<br><br><br>
quickly, efficiently and in an environment-friendly<br>
manner with optimum selectivity and detectability.<br>
This problem is solved by the features of claims 1 and<br>
15.<br>
According to the invention, a set of different<br>
separating elements is provided, from which a<br>
separating device with different stationary phases can<br>
be constructed, construction being carried out by<br>
coupling or connecting different separating elements<br>
together.<br>
Said set according to the invention comprises<br>
separating elements of different stationary phases S1<br>
(i ≥ 2) and at least three of these separating elements<br>
containing different stationary phases Si, which can be<br>
coupled or connected together.<br>
Coupling or connection is carried out by coupling or<br>
connecting the separating elements as such, in<br>
particular coupling the carrier elements, which form<br>
the separating element together with the respective<br>
stationary phase. For example, column segments can be<br>
coupled by coupling the column segments together on<br>
their respective tube ends.<br>
Coupling of the separating elements via additional<br>
couplers or connectors is also possible.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, two<br>
stationary phases SA and SB are different if they differ<br>
from one another in their selectivity.<br>
The minimal set thus comprises in each case three<br>
separating elements or column segments SA and in each<br><br><br>
case three separating elements or column segments SB,<br>
where A and B are stationary phases of different<br>
selectivity.<br>
Preferably, a set comprises at least three separating<br>
elements or column segments comprising different<br>
stationary phases SA, SB and Sc, with the set containing<br>
3 of each of these kinds of separating elements,<br>
preferably at least 5, preferably at least 7 and<br>
especially preferably in each case 10 or more.<br>
The respective stationary phases should be selected so<br>
that they possess different physiochemical properties.<br>
Such a set can contain for example separating elements<br>
with stationary phases, comprising saturated or<br>
unsaturated alkyl groups (C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C8, C12,<br>
C14, C16, C18, C22, C27, C30), which can be mono-,<br>
poly- or acyclic, ali- or heterocyclic, nitro, cyano,<br>
carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, diol, or thiol groups,<br>
glycidoxy groups, optionally etherified, amino or<br>
chiral groups, amide groups, carbamates, urea,<br>
perfluoralkyl groups or perfluoraryl groups and other<br>
haloalkyl and haloaryl groups, polybutadiene groups or<br>
other organic polymers, affinity-chromatographic<br>
modifications or ion-exchangeable groups (cation<br>
exchangers, anion exchangers, zwitterions), unmodified<br>
support materials (e.g. silica gel), molecularly<br>
imprinted polymers (MIPs) or combinations thereof, e.g.<br>
multifunctional stationary phases, optionally<br>
additionally to or instead of the aforementioned three<br>
different types of separating elements.<br>
In contrast to multidimensional chromatography, the<br>
substances are separated on the separating device or<br>
column coupled or connected on the basis of<br><br>
optimization, i.e. the components of the mixture pass<br>
through the whole separating device. The separating<br>
elements that are coupled together remain connected to<br>
one another at least for a complete separation - a<br>
coupling or decoupling during the separation process,<br>
as is known in multidimensional chromatography, does<br>
not take place.<br>
Another important point is that the ratio of the<br>
stationary phases of the coupled separating device to<br>
one another is variable, since the separating device<br>
can be dismantled again into the individual separating<br>
elements and a separating device with a different ratio<br>
of the stationary phases to one another and with a<br>
different selectivity can be constructed from them.<br>
In contrast to the known mixed-bed columns, the desired<br>
column according to the invention is constructed by<br>
mechanical coupling of individual ready-to-use<br>
separating elements, i.e. generally by connecting or<br>
coupling together the carrier elements (e.g. pieces of<br>
tube as column segments). This does not alter the<br>
stationary phases that remain unchanged in the<br>
separating elements, in particular they are not mixed<br>
together.<br>
In contrast to the production of pre-calculated mixed-<br>
bed columns, for which ultimately the column<br>
manufacturer packs a column according to specific<br>
customer requirements, i.e. has to prepare and mix a<br>
special stationary phase, according to the invention,<br>
the user can make the desired separating device in situ<br>
by simple mechanical coupling of the necessary column<br>
segments.<br><br>
The invention also relates to a method of production of<br>
an optimized device for separating mixtures of<br>
substances.<br>
First, with each of the at least two types of<br>
stationary phases Si (i ≥ 2), a basis measurement of<br>
the mixture to be separated in a mobile phase that is<br>
to be established is carried out and the relevant<br>
retention factor k of each component is determined from<br><br>
(tR: retention time, tm: flow time, tmEc: extracolumn-<br>
volume-correction). The extracolumn-volume-correction<br>
takes account of the time contribution by the volume of<br>
the feed lines, of the injector and of the detector<br>
cell. It is recommended to specify the mobile phase so<br>
that the K values lie between the substances that are<br>
to be eluted first and last in the range from 1 to 20.<br>
The basis measurement should preferably be performed on<br>
each kind of separating element (e.g. SA, SB, Sc) or on<br>
several similar or different coupled elements (for<br>
example 10 coupled elements SA or 5 SA, 3 SB, 2 SC; 3 SA,<br>
5 SB, 2 Sc and 2 SA, 3 SB; 5 SB) . The basis measurement<br>
can also be carried out on a separate basis measurement<br>
column.<br>
From the k values determined for each component to be<br>
separated and for each type of separating elements with<br>
the stationary phase Si, the optimized combination of<br>
separating elements and their dimension is then<br>
calculated for the specific separation problem and the<br>
optimized separating device is then coupled or<br>
otherwise connected in the previously calculated manner<br><br>
from the separating elements of the predetermined<br>
dimension.<br>
The dimension of a separating element means the volume<br>
of the respective stationary phase in the separating<br>
element. In the case of separating elements with a<br>
constant diameter the dimension is proportional to the<br>
length. If all separating elements have the same<br>
diameter and the same length, the dimension is<br>
proportional to the number N of separating elements to<br>
be coupled.<br>
The most suitable combination of the separating<br>
elements for the specific separation problem is<br>
preferably calculated using the prism model. Preferably<br>
stipulating a predetermined number N of separating<br>
elements to be coupled, for any possible combination of<br>
stationary phases and their dimension, in particular<br>
the number of separating elements of a predetermined<br>
total number N=X+Y+Zof separating elements,<br>
based on the retention factors ki determined with the<br>
basis measurement, the respective retention factor of<br>
the component to be separated at selectivity point XYZ,<br>
i.e. the retention factor kxyz of the respective<br>
heterogeneous combination of the stationary phases Si<br>
is calculated<br><br>
where X denotes the number of separating elements SA, Y<br>
the number of separating elements SB and Z the<br>
respective number of separating elements Sc.<br>
From the large number of calculated coupling<br>
possibilities XYZ, the coupling of the separating<br><br>
elements or segments with the best selectivity a is<br>
determined from<br><br>
where tR1 is the retention time of the respective<br>
compound and W1/2 1 is the half-height peak width of the<br>
respective compound, and the separating device, in<br>
particular column, optimized for this separation<br>
problem, and comprising N separating elements, is then<br>
coupled together from the respective elements or column<br>
segments.<br>
With specially calculated coupling of the separating<br>
elements, in particular column segments, the stationary<br>
phase can be optimized with respect to the particular<br>
separation problem, so that it is no longer necessary<br>
to perform elution with a continuously or stepwise<br>
varying mobile phase or get the manufacturer to pack<br>
special mixed-bed columns.<br>
If the basis measurement already shows that the desired<br>
separation can be achieved with only one type of column<br>
segments, the rest of the calculation can be used for<br>
optimizing the length of the column ' and for<br>
constructing the column only from the one type of<br>
column segments.<br>
Otherwise the various possible combinations of the<br>
column segments for a given number of column segments N<br>
are calculated, until the desired separation is<br>
achieved. Optimization and calculation can be<br><br><br>
terminated when the desired selectivity acrit or<br>
resolution Rs,crit of the critical peak pair or pairs is<br>
accomplished.<br>
If, within the scope of calculation of the various<br>
possible combinations with for example three types of<br>
column segments and a total number of N column<br>
segments, sufficiently good separation is not<br>
calculated, i.e. no Rs,Crit is obtained below the value<br>
defined for the particular separation problem, the<br>
number N of column segments is altered, in particular<br>
increased, and the calculation is carried out once<br>
again with this altered number N'.<br>
If, within the scope of this calculation with N column<br>
segments, no satisfactory separation is predicted, a<br>
new calculation becomes necessary, adding one or more<br>
additional stationary phases.<br>
For this, basis measurements are carried out<br>
additionally with the additional column segments Sj and<br>
then a new calculation is performed.<br>
If, for a given combination, the separation capacity is<br>
insufficient, the resolution can be improved by<br>
increasing the total number of column segments N at the<br>
existing ratio. In practice, if separation is too good,<br>
the number of segments can be reduced in the same<br>
ratio, in order to shorten the total cycle time.<br>
The separating device optimized for the particular<br>
separation problem is then coupled or connected from<br>
the separating elements in the calculated number and/or<br>
dimension and the corresponding separation is carried<br>
out.<br><br>
The elution sequence and the resolution of the peaks<br>
can be predicted on the basis of the calculation.<br>
Thus, the separating device, in particular column,<br>
optimized for the particular separation problem, can be<br>
assembled quickly and efficiently from the set of<br>
separating elements, namely generally on the basis of<br>
only three (!) basis measurements.<br>
Although often three different stationary phases are<br>
sufficient to achieve a sufficiently effective, in<br>
particular isocratic separation, the number of<br>
stationary phases can of course be further increased to<br>
four, five or more, and the formula for calculating the<br>
heterogeneous retention factor K in the numerator and<br>
denominator is extended correspondingly to n stationary<br>
phases.<br>
If the stationary phases or the separating elements<br>
comprising the stationary phases do not have the same<br>
dimensions (e.g. diameter and length of the packed<br>
column segments), the retention factor for each<br>
component can be calculated from the following equation<br><br>
where a, |3, y correspond to the total internal volumes<br>
of the separating elements packed with the stationary<br>
phases A, B and C in the heterogeneous combination.<br>
kfl;B,c are - as already described - the retention factors<br>
determined by the respective basis measurements.<br>
If, in the subsequent measurement, a protective column<br>
must be provided before the separating device, this has<br>
to be taken into account in the basis measurement and<br>
in the calculation.<br><br><br>
Another advantage is . that the first column segment can<br>
also be regarded and used as a protective column and<br>
can if necessary be replaced very easily. Accordingly,<br>
use of an additional protective column is unnecessary.<br>
The method according to the invention can moreover also<br>
be applied in a variant, so that - without stipulating<br>
particular dimensions of the separating elements - the<br>
optimized separating device is calculated from the<br>
basis measurements and the optimized column can then be<br>
packed correspondingly by the manufacturer according to<br>
the previously calculated proportions of the individual<br>
stationary phases. In this case the calculation<br>
provides the selectivity-optimized volumes of each<br>
stationary phase, and the individual volumes determined<br>
are then packed in a suitable carrier element, e.g. a<br>
suitable column.<br>
Generally, with the device according to the invention<br>
and the method according to the invention, it is not<br>
the mobile phase that is subject to a continuously<br>
varying composition, but rather the separating device,<br>
in particular column, assembled separation-specifically<br>
by coupling the respective separating elements, has the<br>
varying composition that is necessary for a selective<br>
separation, based on separating elements or segments<br>
with different selectivities, i.e. the separating<br>
device has a gradient of the stationary phase.<br>
Accordingly, separation with the device according to<br>
the invention can also take place isocratically with<br>
the desired selectivity, so that the disadvantages<br>
described for gradient elution are avoided. Thus,<br>
backwashing is not required, i.e. there is a saving of<br>
solvent and the total cycle time is shortened. In<br>
addition, the mobile phase or at any rate a large part<br><br><br>
of the fractions that are not contaminated with<br>
substances of different polarity in an isocratic<br>
elution, can be recycled, giving an additional saving<br>
on the costs for disposal and for the supply of fresh<br>
solvents, and it is also beneficial for the<br>
environment.<br>
For this, preferably, individual regions of the mobile<br>
phase, which are laden with the respective separated<br>
substances, are removed and the rest of the solvent is<br>
captured, recycled and reused. Especially in the area<br>
of preparative chromatography, which uses considerable<br>
amounts of solvents, reusability of the solvents<br>
achieved with isocratic chromatography is not only of<br>
great advantage on environmental grounds, but also<br>
represents a considerable cost saving, as the costs of<br>
disposal and supply of fresh solvents are greatly<br>
reduced.<br>
Another important advantage of the invention is that,<br>
with isocratic elution, many more different detection<br>
principles and therefore detectors can be used for<br>
determining the respective substances.<br>
Since the composition of the mobile phase remains<br>
constant in isocratic elution, the differential<br>
refractometer can again be used for universal detection<br>
of the substances.<br>
Often, the isocratic elution of the substances and<br>
therefore the separation with the set according to the<br>
invention can take place in an acetonitrile/water<br>
mixture, for which the rise in absorption in the UV<br>
does not begin until a wavelength of 190 nm (50%<br>
transmission). Accordingly, substances with<br><br><br>
chromophores can, as a result of isocratic elution, be<br>
detected even in the short-wave UV region.<br>
The separation that can be carried out isocratically<br>
according to the invention thus makes it possible to<br>
use other, often more suitable, more sensitive and/or<br>
less expensive methods of detection.<br>
As the composition of the mobile phase is constant over<br>
time, in addition of course, in each method of<br>
detection the base line is more stable and effects due<br>
to mixing are avoided.<br>
Isocratic separation also has a beneficial effect on<br>
the quality of the mass spectra, as the ionization<br>
remains constant and in addition no gradient-induced<br>
secondary effects occur (stable, constant background).<br>
Moreover, for detection in isocratic elution it is also<br>
possible to use electrochemical detectors or<br>
conductivity detectors.<br>
Since, as a result of isocratic analysis, nearly	all<br>
detection principles are now available, there is	the<br>
possibility of coupling the various detectors	in<br>
series, for improved characterization of	the<br>
substances.<br>
Furthermore, with the device according to the<br>
invention, the fault-prone equipment required for<br>
providing the gradient, such as additional pumps and<br>
gradient mixers, is no longer required, leading not<br>
only to lower acquisition costs for the chromatograph,<br>
but also to reduced operating costs.<br><br><br>
The set of separating elements according to the<br>
invention and the method according to the invention can<br>
be used for all methods employing physicochemical<br>
separation based on different interactions with at<br>
least two phases, such as gas chromatography (GC) ,<br>
liquid chromatography (LC) (column or planar),<br>
chromatography with supercritical gases as the mobile<br>
phase (supercritical fluid chromatography, SFC),<br>
electrophoretic separation techniques, in each case in<br>
the nano, micro, analytical and preparative areas of<br>
application, and in the area of sample preparation<br>
and/or purification by solid-phase extraction or<br>
filtration.<br>
In liquid chromatography, methods are also employed<br>
that take place at reduced pressure (e.g. flash<br>
chromatography) or elevated pressure (e.g. HPLC, MPLC)<br>
or that utilize different mechanisms of interaction for<br>
separation, e.g. reversed-phase liquid chromatography<br>
(RP) , normal-phase chromatography (NP) , ion<br>
chromatography (IC), size-exclusion chromatography<br>
(SEC, GPC) or hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
(HIC, HILIC).<br>
The separating element of the stationary phase can be<br>
for example a segment of a column, a segment of a TLC<br>
plate or of an electrophoresis gel. Although the<br>
present invention is described mainly with reference to<br>
columns and column segments, what is said also applies<br>
appropriately to other separating elements or segmented<br>
or segmentable separating devices, for example TLC<br>
plates, which can be adapted to any possible length of<br>
the stationary phase in question.<br>
The coupling of stationary phases is also independent<br>
of the type of support material used (silica gels,<br><br>
polymers, metal oxides, glasses, quartz glasses,<br>
polysaccharides, agarose gels, carbon etc.) and also<br>
applies to all orders of magnitude of the<br>
chromatographic process, from miniaturized nano-methods<br>
to the preparative range.<br>
Furthermore, the stationary phase can be either<br>
particulate, fibrous or fiberlike, or it can be<br>
monolithic. An advantage in using monolithic stationary<br>
phases is that they can be coupled very easily, as the<br>
stationary phase does not have to be retained by frits<br>
or sieves.<br>
The present invention is also especially advantageous<br>
when used in nanotechnology, because with such smaJl<br>
amounts it is extremely difficult to provide gradients<br>
in the mobile phase reproducibly.<br>
Of course, the set according to the invention can also<br>
be adapted to special separation techniques or can<br>
contain special segments for special separation<br>
problems, if necessary as additional segments.<br>
Thus, in ion chromatography or ion-pair chromatography<br>
it is also possible to construct the stationary phase<br>
from column segments or for example also couple the<br>
column segments for ion-pair chromatography with other<br>
column segments, for example polar column segments.<br>
A further advantage of using specially pre-calculated<br>
and then coupled or assembled separating devices is<br>
shortening of the total cycle time. The use of the<br>
separating elements and calculation of the individual<br>
separating elements that are to be coupled together as<br>
well as their number ultimately also permits<br>
optimization of the total cycle time, i.e. as short as<br><br><br>
possible, but long enough to achieve the desired<br>
separation.<br>
A set can also comprise segments for targeted<br>
adsorption of certain substances, as in solid-phase<br>
extraction. From the mixture that is to be separated,<br>
the substance in guestion is adsorbed almost<br>
quantitatively in this specific adsorption segment and<br>
is thus enriched in this segment, and is then desorbed<br>
again. Instead of only in one segment, as customary<br>
until now, a veritable cascade of segments could be<br>
envisaged for targeted adsorption of different<br>
substances in series.<br>
The segments according to the invention can also be<br>
used in other separation techniques, such as in<br>
electrochromatography, in which mixtures of substances<br>
are separated on the basis of electroosmotic flow, or<br>
in electrophoresis.<br>
The set according to the invention and the method<br>
according to the invention are suitable for<br>
continuously-operating online processes and/or methods<br>
of separation with a mobile phase and/or constant rate,<br>
for example HPLC, online-TLC and online-OPLC.<br>
The set according to the invention can also comprise at<br>
least two different types of TLC-plates, which should<br>
then each be contained in the set in a larger number,<br>
in particular at least three of each kind. The TLC-<br>
plates can be adapted to the optimized length and the<br>
various TLC-plate segments can then be coup]ed together<br>
to a plate formed from the various segments and<br>
therefore ultimately a plate with a gradient in the<br>
stationary phase.<br><br><br>
In particular, the set enables users to construct in<br>
situ a separating device that is especially suitable<br>
for their (routine) analysis, and then separation can<br>
take place with the advantages of isocratic elution<br>
already described.<br>
The advantages of the optimized separating device are<br>
achieved in particular when the separating device, once<br>
optimized, is used in the continuous separation<br>
process, namely isocratically and with a constant<br>
stationary phase throughout the separation, i.e. even<br>
without "switching" the columns.<br>
In particular applications it is also possible of<br>
course, in addition to optimization of the stationary<br>
phase, to optimize the mobile phase as well for the<br>
separation in question, for example also with a<br>
gradient.<br>
The specific design of the particular column segments<br>
depends of course on the type of separating technique<br>
and the amounts of substances to be separated using the<br>
separating device prepared from the separating elements<br>
that are to be coupled together.<br>
The length of each individual separating element<br>
depends on the subsequent total length of the device<br>
comprising the stationary phase, in particular the<br>
column, and the desired number of segments and the<br>
specific separation problem. In the case of separating<br>
elements that are segments of analytical LC columns,<br>
the length of a segment is at least 0.5 cm, preferably<br>
at least 1.0 cm, to provide simple mechanical coupling-<br>
together of the segments. The length of a column<br>
segment is preferably 2 cm, so that a column with a<br>
length of 20 cm can be constructed from 10 coupled<br><br><br>
segments. Especially preferably, the length of a column<br>
segment is 1 cm or an integral multiple thereof and can<br>
be up to 500 cm; preferably the length of a column<br>
segment is not more than 12.5 cm. In capillary gas<br>
chromatography (cGC) , column segment lengths up to<br>
100 m can be envisaged, and the length is preferably<br>
25 m.<br>
The column segments	can have either the shape of a<br>
straight cylinder or	of a spiral cylinder (especially<br>
in the case of long	column segments, for example for<br>
GC) or can be of some	other shape.<br>
The inside diameter of the column varies considerably<br>
depending on the amount of substance to be separated<br>
and the particular chromatographic process and can be<br>
between about 20 urn and 2 m, in the case of an<br>
analytical column generally between 20 µm and 10 mm.<br>
For isolation purposes a column with an inside diameter<br>
between 2 mm and 1 m will be used.<br>
It is in principle also possible for the set to<br>
comprise additionally "multiple segments". These<br>
"multiple segments" are column segments of a defined<br>
stationary phase also present in the "single segment",<br>
but the length of the "multiple segment" is an integral<br>
multiple of the length of an individual segment. For<br>
example, in addition to 10 individual segments with a<br>
phase comprising phenyl groups of length 2 cm, the set<br>
can also contain a "double segment" with a phase<br>
comprising phenyl groups of length 4 cm and a triple<br>
segment with the phase comprising phenyl groups of<br>
length 6 cm, and with these multiple segments that are<br>
additionally present, the time required for coupling<br>
together and dismantling the segments can be reduced.<br><br><br>
Theoretical considerations based on the prism model<br>
show that, when in addition to column segments of<br>
length 1 in each case a column segment of each type of<br>
stationary phase with a smallest possible length (e.g.<br>
1/2 or 1/4) is included in the calculation, a far wider<br>
working range for selectivity optimization can be<br>
covered with a reasonable number of calculations, than<br>
if for example the total number N of column segments<br>
were to be increased overall by one or two segments.<br>
The separating elements should be coupled by means of<br>
connections that are inert and free from dead space as<br>
far as possible, for example by means of<br>
•	capillary joints<br>
•	directly with the aid of a coupler with small dead<br>
space<br>
•	in the case of capillary columns, by joining the ends<br>
of the capillaries using a coupler, with the ends of<br>
the capillaries being butted together directly<br>
•	again in the case of capillary columns, by shrink-<br>
fitting the ends of the capillaries via a shrinkable<br>
sleeve<br>
•	by screwing the column ends together using a gasket<br>
with a through-hole<br>
•	via a screw connection with a capillary hole<br>
•	directly by bringing together the packing end of one<br>
separating element with the packing end of another<br>
separating element<br><br><br>
• by segmented packing of the stationary phase in a<br>
column tube<br>
Preferably, each separating element has the same<br>
coupling means at each end, so that any end of one<br>
column segment can be connected to any end of another<br>
column segment.<br>
Another preferred embodiment envisages providing<br>
coupling means that are different from one another<br>
(male, female) at either end of the column segment. In<br>
this case the end of one column segment is inserted in<br>
the start of the next one, maintaining the inside<br>
diameter of the packing cross-section and therefore<br>
keeping the linear flow rate constant. In this way, no<br>
turbulence develops at the coupling points. Other<br>
advantages of this system are the chambered seal at the<br>
coupling points and the protected packing of the<br>
individual separating elements. Moreover, the packing<br>
is closed internally and protected. The simple<br>
manipulation by inserting in one another is especially<br>
advantageous. However, the most important point with<br>
this coupling is that coupling is virtually free of<br>
dead space, since the end of the separating segment is<br>
pressed directly, with a thin frit, onto a sieve with<br>
desired cross-filtration.<br>
It is also possible to provide a monolithic seal, with<br>
thickness preferably between 0.5 and 1 mm, at either<br>
end of a column segment. These column segments are<br>
coupled similarly to the manner described above (male,<br>
female). In this case there is the advantage that it is<br>
not necessary to use any metallic terminations such as<br>
sieve and frit. Furthermore, the monolithic seal can be<br>
modified chemically and can thus be adapted to the<br>
particular stationary phase used. With this system it<br><br>
is possible for two separating elements to be connected<br>
together without a transition element (such as sieve<br>
and frit).<br>
If chromatographic plates shortened to the appropriate<br>
length (dimension) are used as separating elements, for<br>
example in TLC, OPLC or HPTLC, the separating elements<br>
can be coupled by overlapping the stationary phases of<br>
two plates at the plate ends, so that the stationary<br>
phase of the first plate for example is directed upward<br>
and the stationary phase of the next plate is directed<br>
downward and so on, or the plates are placed next to<br>
each other and then coupled via an inert bridge, which<br>
then overlaps the stationary phases of both plates.<br>
The method according to the invention will now be<br>
explained in more detail with an example of<br>
application.<br>
I. Example of calculation of the optimized combination<br>
of the separating elements (column segments) in<br>
question on the basis of the prism model:<br>
a) For a mixture of methylparaben,	acetoph enone,<br>
ethylparaben, dimethyl phthalate, 2,3-dimethylphenol,<br>
methyl benzoate and anisole, determine the best<br>
possible separation that is possible with a combination<br>
of 10 column segments with cyano and/or phenyl and/or<br>
C18 groups in acetonitrile/water 3C: 70	(v/v) as<br>
solvent.<br>
The set comprises in each case at least 10 column<br>
segments with CN as stationary phase (SCN), 10 column<br><br>
segments with phenyl groups as stationary phase SPH and<br>
10 column segments with C18 as stationary phase (Sc18).<br>
For each of these three different stationary phases,<br>
the respective retention factor k, shown in the<br>
following table, is determined according to (1) with.in<br>
the scope of a basis measurement for each of the 7<br>
different substances to be separated:<br><br>
In the present example, the total number of column<br>
segments N to be coupled together is set at 10. For<br>
each heterogeneous coupling of the column segments,<br>
i.e. X-times the stationary phase SCN, Y-times the<br>
stationary phase SPH and Z-times the stationary phase<br>
SC18 with N = 10 = X + Y + Z, the retention factor<br><br>
of the heterogeneous coupling at the selectivity point<br>
XYZ is calculated according to (2) . The selectivities<br>
of all adjacent pairs of peaks are now calculated from<br>
the calculated retention factors of the respective<br>
couplings XYZ of separating elements. The optimum<br>
selectivity point is the point XYZ at which all pairs<br>
of peaks achieve a base line separation. If several<br>
selectivity points achieve a base line separation, the<br>
ideal point is the one with additionally the smallest<br>
retention factor for the last eluting component.<br>
The value for the base line separation, the point at<br><br>
which a peak reaches the base line again, depends on<br>
the particular chromatographic technique or on the<br>
separation efficiency that the particular method of<br>
separation can achieve. In the case of HPLC, to satisfy<br>
the requirements for good resolution, this value should<br>
be about 1.15, for GC it should be about 1.05 and for<br>
TLC it should be greater than 1.3.<br>
As shown by the following comparison of measured and<br>
calculated retention factors for the example of the<br>
selectivity point 442, i.e. 4 segments SCN, 4 segments<br>
SPH and 2 segments SC18, the average deviation between<br>
calculated and measured retention factors is on average<br>
approx. 4%:<br><br>
The selectivity of a separation depends on, among other<br>
things, how many separating elements or column segments<br>
with different stationary phases (or different polarity<br>
of the latter) can be coupled together and on the total<br>
number N of column segments to be coupled.<br>
a2) For a mixture of 8 triazines, determine the best<br>
possible separation that is possible with a combination<br>
of in each case 10 column segments with cyan o and/or<br>
phenyl and/or C18 groups and/or C18 with polar embedded<br>
amide group in methanol /water 50:50 (v/v) as solvent._<br>
The set comprises in each case at least 10 column<br>
segments with CN as stationary phase (SCN), 10 column<br>
segments with phenyl groups as stationary phase SPH, 10<br>
column segments with C18 as stationary phase (Sc18) and<br><br>
10 column segments with polar embedded C18 as<br>
stationary phase (SpeC18).<br>
For each of these four different stationary phases,<br>
within the scope of a basis measurement, the respective<br>
retention factor k is determined according to (1) for<br>
each of the 8 different substances to be separated, and<br>
» is shown in the following table:<br><br>
The chromatograms for these values are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
It can be seen that none of the individual separating<br>
columns is able to solve the separation problem by<br>
itself.<br><br><br>
Fig. 1. Separation of triazines on the different<br>
stationary phases<br>
The optimum composition of the stationary phase can be<br>
determined from the calculation of the k values and<br>
selectivities of all possible combinations. In this<br>
case it comprises 180 mm of the phenyl phase, 60 mm of<br>
the C18 phase with polar embedded group and 60 mm of<br>
the cyano phase.<br>
The retention factors calculated for the optimum column<br>
composition are compared against the measured values in<br>
the following table. The deviations are on average<br>
3.4%.<br><br>
The calculated and measured chromatograms are compared<br>
in Fig. 2. It can clearly be seen that they are in<br>
excellent agreement.<br><br><br>
prediction<br>
b) Number_ of possible combinatjons<br>
I)	Starting from s = 3 different column segments (SA, SB<br>
and Sc; here: SCN, SPH and SC18) of the same dimension and<br>
a total number N = 10 of coupled column segments, we<br>
get 27 possible combinations, if only two of the three<br>
different column segments are coupled together, i.e.<br>
only SA, SB or SA, Sc or SB, Sc. There are an additional<br>
36 possible combinations if all three different column<br>
segments SA, SB, Sc are coupled together.<br>
Thus, in total, with three types of column segments of<br>
different polarity and a total number of 10 segments to<br>
be coupled, there are 63 possible combinations.<br>
II)	If the number of columns to be combined is not<br>
given as exactly 10, but instead the total number N is<br>
given as a range from 6 to 15, with n = 6 to 15, s = 3<br>
the number of possible combinations increases to 625.<br>
III)	The use of an additional stationary phase SD, i.e.<br>
s = 4, for the above calculation of the possible<br>
combinations (I), i.e. N = 10, with three stationary<br>
phases gives 960 possible combinations with 2, 3 or 4<br>
stationary phases.<br>
IV)	If, on the basis of III), the total number is<br>
extended to at least 6 and at most 15, then with s = 4<br>
and the combinations of in each case 3 phases we get a<br>
total of 2500 possibilities.<br>
By extending the number of available stationary phases<br>
for example to five or more, of combinations with one<br>
another (for example combinations not more than three,<br>
but of four different stationary phases in coupling),<br>
there is a further increase in possible combinations.<br>
Further "fine-tuning" can be achieved by taking into<br>
account ½ or 1/4 segments in the calculation.<br><br><br><br>
The invention is described below on the basis of a preferred example of application for the coupling<br>
of the column segments.<br>
The column comprises one or more column segments and a holder, which in its turn comprises<br>
individual holding elements that can be screwed together, and can if required be screwed to the<br>
connectors at the top and bottom of the respective column.<br>
Independently of this especially preferred embodiment described in detail below, it is also possible<br>
for the individual holding elements to be connected by means of bayonet joints or other types of<br>
joints. Moreover, it is also possible to omit individual holding elements entirely and insert the<br>
column segments into a guide sleeve of the appropriate length with threaded ends, and then press<br>
together the individual column segments axially with the connectors that can be screwed on the<br>
guide sleeve.<br>
The column segments can also be pressed together axially by hydraulic means in an appropriate<br>
device.<br>
An important point in the following especially preferred embodiment is that the inside diameter of<br>
the column remains constant even at the coupling points so that the flow rate is constant<br>
throughout the column.<br>
Furthermore, the column coupling described below can also be used in general for the coupling of<br>
columns, for example of precolumns and main columns.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying diagrams show:<br>
Fig. 1:	a) an exploded view of a column segment and<br>
b) a schematic representation of the complete column segment,<br>
Fig. 2:	a schematic representation of the fitting<br><br>
of a column segment from Fig. 1b) in a<br>
holding element 30 (Step 1), the fitting of<br>
a further holding element 30' (Step 2) and<br>
the fitting of a further column segment 11'<br>
(Step 3),<br>
Fig. 3: a schematic representation of the coupling<br>
of the top column segment 11 or of the top<br>
holding element 30 and of the bottom column<br>
segment 11" or of the bottom holding<br>
element 30" to the respective adapters and<br>
Fig. 4: a schematic representation of the column<br>
segments and adapters coupled together to<br>
form a column.<br>
The column segment 11 (cf. Fig. 1) comprises a column<br>
tube 13 with a stationary phase 12. The column tube 13,<br>
which can be made for example of metal, plastic,<br>
ceramic or combinations thereof, has a predefined<br>
outside contour with steps 22, 21 and a constant inside<br>
diameter di.<br>
At the head end 14, the tube 13 is provided with a<br>
defined recess 15, which must be larger in diameter d15<br>
than the inside diameter di. The "recess 15 has a<br>
shoulder, for the fitting seal 17. The seal 17 can be<br>
made for example of plastic, metal or some other<br>
material suitable for sealing. The recess 15 receives a<br>
filter or a filter-sieve combination 16, which protects<br>
the stationary phase, and has the ring seal 17 above<br>
it. The wall 18 of the recess 15 serves simultaneously<br>
as a guide during coupling with another column segment<br>
11' or for fitting a male adapter 40, described later.<br>
The tube 13 is shaped at its foot 19 according to a<br>
male connector 21 and is closed by a porous frit 20,<br>
which has the purpose of holding the stationary phase<br>
12 in the tube 13. The porous frit 20 can be of metal,<br>
plastic, ceramic, sintered silica gel, monolithic<br><br>
silica gel or monolithic polymer, optionally surface-<br>
modified .<br>
The holding element 30 (Fig. 2) receives the column<br>
segment 11 and its coupling. The holding element 30 can<br>
be of metal, plastic, ceramic or a combination thereof.<br>
It has an internal thread 32 at the head end 31 and an<br>
external thread 34 at the foot end 33. Inside the<br>
holding element 30 there is a through-hole 35 with a<br>
step 36, into which the column segment 11 fits. The<br>
step 22 of the column segment 11 bears on the step 3 6<br>
of the holding element 30.<br>
The outside surface 37 of the holding element 30 can be<br>
knurled diagonally or axially for easier manipulation<br>
or can have surfaces for using a wrench.<br>
Assembly of the column segments is illustrated in Figs.<br>
2 and 3:<br>
1.	Put the column segment 11 in the holding element<br>
30 in the manner described previously (arrow 1 in<br>
Fig. 2).<br>
2.	Screw another holding element 30' fully into the<br>
first holding element 30 at the head end 31. This<br>
locks the column element 11 in the holding<br>
element 30 (arrow 2 in Fig. 2) .<br>
3.	Put another column segment 11' into the threaded<br>
holding element 30' (arrow 3 in Fig. 2).<br>
4 . Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired number of<br>
column segments 30 is reached.<br>
5.	Insert a male adapter 40 into the recess 15 in<br>
the top column segment 11 in Fig. 3 and screw the<br>
adapter screw 41 into the holding element 30.<br>
6.	At the bottom end 19 of the bottom column segment<br><br>
11", fit the female adapter 42 on the projection<br>
21" and screw on the holding element 30 with the<br>
adapter nut 43.<br>
7. The resultant segmented column can now be<br>
connected by means of a capillary connection<br>
(stainless steel, plastic or fused silica) to the<br>
chromatographic system.<br>
If, in the above preferred embodiment, for example a<br>
double-length column segment is to be connected to<br>
other column segments, the double-length column segment<br>
can be held in two holding elements joined together and<br>
can then be coupled. <br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	Set of elements for the production of a device for separating substances by distributing between<br>
a stationary and a mobile phase, wherein the set includes at least six individual separating<br>
elements coupleable together to form a separating device, wherein the separating elements are<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
ELEMENTS FOR SEPARATING SUBSTANCES BY DISTRIBUTING BETWEEN A<br>
STATIONARY AND A MOBILE PHASE. AND METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A<br>
SEPARATING DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to elements for separating substances by distributing between a stationary<br>
and a mobile phase. Said separating elements comprise any stationary phase and a support<br>
element. The separating elements are part of a set that in provided with at least two separating<br>
elements Ti (i ≥ 2) encompassing different stationary phase Si (i ≥ 2). The set comprises at least<br>
three pieces of each type of separating element Ti with a specific stationary phase Si. The<br>
separating elements can be coupled to each other or interconnected in another manner so as to<br>
form a separating device. The invention further relates to a method for producing an optimized<br>
device for separating substance mixtures.</td>
