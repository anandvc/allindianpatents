				<td>The present invention relates to a spinning frame with a compacting device, in particular a ring spinning frame.<br>
A spinning frame of this type is being described in the German patent application DE 4426249.3 (obj. 2495), according to which a fibre band on a compacting device is being covered by an umbrella in order to concentrate the air entering the compacting device.<br>
To increase the yam quality, the components of the compacting device as well as the umbrella, are to be optimized.<br>
The object of the invention is obtained by a spinning frame with a compacting device as described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame with a compacting device for a fibre band between a drafting unit and a twisting and winding device, with a perforated compacting element, which within its inner space is being furnished with a suction element with a suction device, and with an umbrella shaped cover being arranged at its outside within the effective zone of the suction element characterized in that the height h of the gap between the umbrella and the compacting element amounts to between 0.5 and 3.5 mm, 10 to 2.0 mm in particular and preferably 1.5 mm.<br><br>
The compacting device of the spinning frame is arranged within or between a drafting unit and a twisting and winding device. The main component of the invention is a perforated compacting element which within its inner space is being furnished with a suction element and a suction device. Outside at a distance to the compacting device an umbrella is being arranged within the effective zone of the suction element, whereat the height of the gap between the umbrella and the compacting element can amount to between 0.5 to 3.5 mm, 1.5 mm in particular. The optimal gap height depends on the geometric conditions in the compacting device and on the yam count of the yam to be produced. Preferably the umbrella is being arranged at a distance of less then 20 mm from the clamping gap between two rollers at the outlet of the drafting unit. In drawing-off direction of the fibre band the umbrella is being arranged in an offset position towards the suction element of less than 20 mm, preferably 10 mm and in particular 5 mm. Thus it is achieved that protruding fibers in the fibre band after leaving the drafting units are being caught immediately by an<br><br>
increasing air stream, thereby fibers protruding at the edges are being pressed back onto the fibre band and are being well integrated into the fibre compound during the following twisting procedure. As twisting device preferably a ring spinning device is being applied. The umbrella projects the fibre band laterally to its running direction so far that air flowing into the gap between the umbrella and the compacting element is possibly oriented laterally to the fibre flow and parallel to the condensing direction. In particular at the beginning of the condensing process the air has to flow from two sides each from the edges of the umbrella onto the fibre band. In particular in the section where the fibre band has not yet been condensed the surrounding air has to flow parallel to the outer surface of the compacting element and laterally towards the fibre band. At an inclined fibre guidance on the compacting element the edges of the umbrella being essentially oriented in the running direction of the fibre band, said edges are to be designed in such a way that the inclined course of the fibre band is being supported by the air flow. With for instance two fibre bands , both being led over one compacting element with one suction zone for each band, this is being achieved in such a way that at the entrance side for the fibre band into an umbrella, in the middle of said umbrella a cut-out is being provided, causing the suction air to flow from the cut-out sideways towards the right and towards the left of the fibre band.<br>
The width of the compacting zone is given on one hand by the perforation in the compacting element and on the other hand by one or more suction openings in the suction element. The width of the compacting zone in relation to the height of the gap between the compacting element and the umbrella measures preferably between 1 and 5. The projection of the umbrella measured on one respective side at right angle to the moving direction of the fibre band, divided by the mentioned gap height, should be larger than 1, preferably larger than 2 and in particular larger than 3. The length of the suction zone of the suction element, or the length of the compacting zone on the compacting element preferably amounts to between 30 and 50 mm. The compacting element can be furnished in form of a rigid drum of circular-cylindrical shape in place of the outlet roller of the drafting unit or said element can<br><br>
be furnished as endless perforated tape (apron), which at the outlet or in succession of the drafting unit is being driven by a roller in moving direction of the fibre band. Within each compacting element, being arranged within the compacting zone or the suction zone respectively, there is a hollow body with an opening being directed against the perforation In the compacting element. Over its entire circumference and over the width of the compacting zone the compacting element is being provided with numerous preferably circular holes of a diameter between 0.8 and 1.6 mm, whereat the holes are being arranged in particularly 1 to 5 rows next to each other and which are offset in the transporting direction of the fibre band. The umbrella extends towards two sides away from the fibre band, that is at right angle to its moving direction preferably within a zone whose width corresponds with one to five times of the gap height between the umbrella and the compacting element.<br>
In the following the invention is being described in detail by way of an exemplified embodiment.<br>
Wherein show:<br>
fig. 1	schematic illustration of a side view of a compacting device at right<br>
angle to the moving direction of the fibre band<br>
fig. 2	a meridian sectional view of the compacting element of figure 1 within<br>
the area of the umbrella<br>
fig. 3	a top view in the direction of the arrow at 26 in figure 1<br>
fig, 4a<br>
and 4b	two configurations of the perforations in the compacting element in<br>
relation to the suction element.<br><br>
According to figure 1 a fibre band 10 delivered from a not further shown drafting unit is being led through a clamping gap between an inlet roller 24 and a compacting element 262, whereat the inlet roller 24 and the compacting element 262 can be provided in place of the outlet rollers as part of the drafting unit. At a distance a from the clamping gap measured on the circumference of the compacting element 262 an umbrella 30 is being arranged at a distance h above the compacting element 262, whereat the front edge of the umbrella 30 is arranged offset in moving direction of the fibre band by the distance b in relation to the suction element 200, As can be seen from figure 1, the gap height h in moving direction of the fibre band can decrease gradually in downward direction, whereby a concentration of the suction air entering the gap between the umbrella 30 and the compacting element 262 from the side, that means in direction of the axis of the rollers 24 and 28 results. Inside the compacting element 262 the compacting device 26 is furthermore being provided with a suction element 200, with a suction zone 200a, formed by an opening being directed against a perforation within the compacting element 262. Through said opening surrounding air is being drawn in through the perforation of the compacting element and which is being suctioned off by a suction device 201. The fibre band 10 leaves the compacting zone 264 through a clamping gap between the compacting element 262 and an outlet roller 28, where after the fibre band is being twisted into a yarn 12 by the effect of the not shown twisting device.<br>
Figure 2 shows the compacting element 262 in a cross section. Below said compacting element is the suction element 200 and above it the umbrella 30 is being arranged. The fibre band 10a is shown on the outer surface of the compacting element 262. The laterally entering air stream, according to the arrows at 30 and at 262, passes through the perforation 266 into the compacting zone 264 of the compacting element 262, further through an opening within the suction zone 200a of the suction element 200, as indicated by the arrows below the perforation 266. The rim of the umbrella 30 projects laterally beyond the compacting zone 264 with the perforation 266 towards the right and the left by the measurement u, thereby forming a channel between the umbrella 30 and the compacting element 262, through which<br><br>
the entering air stream is being directed at right angle onto the fibre band 10a. Thus fibers projecting from the edges of the fibre band 10 can be pressed back against it. The perforation 266 in the compacting element 262 extends over a width m, while the width of the suction zone 200a is being marked by the measurement k.<br>
As is being indicated schematically in figure 3, two fibre bands 10a, 10b can be led over a compacting element 262. whereat the moving paths of the fibre band 10a and 10b respectively, are being inclined in relation to the axis of the compacting device, that is by an angle &gt;90"". The umbrella 30 covers both fibre bands 10a and 10b, whereat a cut-out 30a is to be provided in the umbrella between the fibre bands at the inlet side for the fibre bands, so that from this cut-out 30a the surrounding air possibly can enter downwards into the gap between the umbrella 30 and the compacting element 262 at a right angle to the moving direction of the fibre bands 10a and 10b. The suction zone 200a is being indicated with a dotted line. It extends over the length I in direction of the fibre band 10a below said fibre band. The suction element 200 comprises a suction zone 200a which is being oriented in moving direction of the fibre band 10 at an angle of 90° or &gt;90"" in relation to the axis of the compacting element 262, measured within the projection of the compacting device 26 at right angle to the axis of the compacting element 262.<br>
In figure 4a the perforation 266 extends over a larger width than the suction zone 200a so that the umbrella 30 projects by the measurement u beyond the edge of the suction zone 200a or beyond the compacting zone respectively. The compacting zone 264 in this case is limited to the width of the suction zone 200a. Different from the above stated configuration, according to figure 4b the effective width of the compacting zone 264 results from the width m of the perforation 266, even though the width of the suction zone k extends over a larger zone. In this case the umbrella 30 projects beyond the compacting zone 264 laterally by the measurement u, whereat the measurement u can obtain a value of up to five times the gap height h.<br><br>
From the accompanying list result the preferred values for the mentioned measurements in absolute values or in their relation (ratio) from one another respectively. The indicated dimensions apply for the yarn count range Ne = 10...80. With a compacting device according to this description, and for a yarn being produced accordingly, the obtained yarn quality values which are by far above the quality of yarns produced for instance with conventional ring spinning frames.<br>
