				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
manufacture of a ferrous-based sintered article made<br>
therefrom and to a method for their manufacture<br>
particularly, ferrous materials containing copper.<br>
The powder metallurgy route enables the design of<br>
metallic materials which it is not possible to make by-<br>
conventional casting and ingot working processes. It is<br>
known to infiltrate sintered ferrous powder metallurgical<br>
products with metals having lower melting points such as<br>
lead and copper, for example. Lead is used to improve<br>
machinability of sintered ferrous materials whilst copper<br>
also has this effect but also has other desirable<br>
properties which it confers on the sintered material.<br>
Lead is nowadays avoided due to its harmful environmental<br>
properties. Copper improves machinability and also<br>
improves the thermal conductivity of the sintered<br>
article.<br>
Copper infiltrated products are used extensively in the<br>
automotive industry for applications such as valve seat<br>
inserts in the cylinder heads of internal combustion<br>
engines, for example. Such products have to perform under<br>
very arduous conditions including repeated impact<br>
loading, marginal lubrication, elevated service<br>
temperatures and hot corrosive gases. Properties to<br>
withstand these conditions are achieved by the suitable<br>
design of the ferrous matrix system. Such ferrous<br>
matrices are often highly alloyed which adversely affects<br>
machinability. Machinability is important to an engine<br>
builder in a production context as it affects<br>
productivity. Copper infiltration provides improved<br>
machinability whilst the copper, itself provides improved<br>
thermal conductivity which has the effect of lowering<br>
operating service temperatures which helps to retain<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
The infiltration process is effected by stacking a copper<br>
alloy compact in contact with the ferrous component and<br>
passing the stacked assembly of the two items through a<br>
sintering furnace at a sintering temperature in the<br>
region of about 1100°C under an inert or reducing gaseous<br>
atmosphere thus effecting sintering and infiltration<br>
simultaneously. During this sintering process the copper<br>
alloy compact melts and the molten alloy infiltrates and :¦<br>
fills the pores of the ferrous component by capillary<br>
action. Only interconnected pores can be filled in this<br>
manner, isolated or otherwise unconnected porosity cannot<br>
be so filled. The composition of the copper alloy compact<br>
is so chosen that it is compatible with the ferrous<br>
material and undesirable reactions or erosion thereof is<br>
avoided as far as possible. The weight of the copper<br>
alloy compact is chosen so as to be able to fill the<br>
majority of the pores, however, as noted above there is<br>
inevitably some residual porosity.<br>
In a variation of the above process, the copper alloy<br>
compact is stacked with a pre-sintered ferrous component<br>
and the two passed through a sintering furnace to effect<br>
infiltration.<br>
The infiltration process is an expensive process owing to<br>
the extra process steps involved. The process requires<br>
the additional steps of: making a separate copper alloy<br>
powder mixture; pressing suitable compacts of the correct<br>
weight from the powder mixture; stacking the compacts<br>
with the ferrous articles themselves prior to passing<br>
through the sintering furnace; and, barrelling the<br>
sintered and infiltrated articles after cooling to remove<br>
the powdery deposit which inevitably forms on the<br>
articles during the sintering process.<br>
In conventional copper infiltrated ferrous products, the<br>
level of copper content generally lies in the range from.<br>
15 to 25 weight%. In non-infiltrated products it is<br>
common to add up to about 5 weight% of copper powder in<br>
the pre-compacted powder mixture. Such relatively small<br>
additions of copper to non-infiltrated ferrous materials<br>
assist the sintering process due to the liquid copper<br>
phase being present.<br>
People have tried to add levels of copper achieved in the<br>
infiltration process by means of additions of the<br>
appropriate amount of elemental copper in the initial<br>
powder mixtures prior to compaction and sintering.<br>
However, due to differences in, for example, powder<br>
particle size, powder density and powder particle<br>
morphology, segregation of the copper tends to occur<br>
during handling of the powder mixtures. Such powder<br>
segregation causes unacceptable variations in the<br>
resulting products. Where only small amounts of elemental<br>
copper powder is present such as the case of up to about<br>
5 weight% noted above, segregation still occurs but the<br>
effect in the resulting products is minimised and does<br>
not cause a serious problem.<br>
At one time components such as valve seat inserts for<br>
engines having the most arduous service environment were<br>
made entirely from highly alloyed steels such as M3/2<br>
class steels for example. Such steels contain relatively<br>
high quantities of . chromium, tungsten, - molybdenum,<br>
vanadium and the like. Whilst components made from such<br>
materials have excellent performance and long service<br>
lives, they are inherently expensive to make and process.<br>
They are expensive to make firstly because of the high<br>
intrinsic material cost and secondly expensive to process<br>
because of the difficulty in machining components having<br>
high contents of hard carbide in the microstructure<br>
thereof. In the never ending quest to lower costs, much<br>
work has been carried out to reduce material cost by<br>
adding relatively high proportions of substantially pure<br>
iron powder to the powder mixes and consequently reducing<br>
processing costs by making the resulting sintered<br>
materials easier to machine by reducing the amount of<br>
hard phases and adding phases which assist machinability<br>
such as copper or chip-breaking phases.<br>
A disadvantage in terms of performance and longevity of<br>
life of these newer materials such as may be exemplified<br>
in GB-A-2 188 _Q62 for example is the retention in the<br>
cores of the iron grains, formed by the sintering<br>
together of the original compacted iron powder particles <br>
in the powder mixture, of soft ferrite phase which can<br>
deleteriously affect the wear and strength, properties<br>
thereof. Such materials may initially comprise mixtures<br>
of about 50% of the highly alloyed M3/2 material, for<br>
example, and about 50% of pure iron powder and minor<br>
additions of carbon, die lubricating waxes and the like.<br>
Even when fully sintered the iron grains have ferrite<br>
cores with only some diffusion of chromium, from the M3/2<br>
regions, into the surface regions of the iron grains,<br>
where martensite may be formed, after sintering. This<br>
structure still applies even when the material is<br>
infiltrated or when up to about 5 weight% of elemental<br>
copper has been added to the powder mixture.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for making ferrous material articles having a<br>
high copper content commensurate with that of infiltrated<br>
material but without the disadvantage of the additional<br>
process steps required in the prior art processes.<br>
Other advantages will become apparent from the<br>
description of the invention below.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a process for the manufacture of a<br>
ferrous-based sintered article containing copper in the<br>
range from 12 to 26 weight%, the process including the<br>
steps of: making a powder mixture having a desired<br>
composition, at least a proportion of a total content of<br>
iron and copper being provided by an iron powder having<br>
copper indivisibly associated therewith; compacting said<br>
powder mixture to form a green compact of an article to<br>
be produced and sintering said green compact.<br>
The copper content is primarily intended to enhance the<br>
thermal conductivity of articles produced, however, other<br>
important benefits are also provided to articles made by<br>
the method of the present invention. Below 12 weight%<br>
copper the required enhancement in thermal conductivity<br>
is not achieved whilst above 26 weight% "bleeding" of<br>
molten copper from the material during sintering is a<br>
problem.<br>
Preferably, the copper content may lie in the range from<br>
15 to 20 weight%.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, the<br>
iron powder indivisibly associated with copper is<br>
effectively a pre-alloyed powder in that the individual<br>
powder particles comprise both iron and copper and<br>
consequently significant segregation between the iron and<br>
copper is not possible. The iron and copper powder<br>
particles may be selected from two basic types of powder<br>
stock: a pre-alloyed iron-copper powder; or, a diffusion<br>
bonded iron-copper powder. The pre-alloyed iron-copper<br>
powder may be produced by known techniques of melting the<br>
constituent materials together and then atomising the<br>
molten melt by water or gas, for example, to produce the<br>
required pre-alloyed powder. The diffusion bonded iron-<br>
copper material is produced by making a mixture of<br>
elemental iron and copper powders, for example, and<br>
passing the mixture, uncompacted, through a furnace such<br>
that diffusion between the particles occurs so as to bond<br>
them together. The "cake" so formed is given a light<br>
crushing operation to break it up into particles<br>
comprising both iron and copper adhered to each other.<br>
Such a process causes diffusion of some copper into the<br>
outer regions of each iron particle.<br>
The method of the present invention obviates several of<br>
the process steps of prior art processes in that a<br>
separate copper alloy powder mixture and consequent<br>
compacts do not need to be made, they do not need to be<br>
stacked with the ferrous material compacts and the final<br>
sintered articles do not need to be treated to remove the<br>
adherent deposit thereon as with prior art infiltration<br>
processes.<br>
A particular advantage conferred by the method of the<br>
present invention relates to the processing of those<br>
ferrous materials which comprise mixtures of an alloyed<br>
steel powder and a low-alloy iron or substantially pure<br>
iron powder. It is known to use such mixtures with<br>
additions of carbon powder, for example, and to process<br>
them by compaction, sintering and post-sintering thermal<br>
treatment into articles such as valve seat inserts for<br>
internal combustion engines, for example. Such prior art<br>
materials may or may not be infiltrated with a copper<br>
alloy by one of the conventional processes described<br>
above. Such materials are exemplified by those materials<br>
and production processes described in GB-A-2 188 062 and<br>
EP-A-0 312 161 for example. These materials may comprise<br>
a proportion, e.g. about 50 weight% of a highly alloyed<br>
steel powder with about 50 weight% of a substantially<br>
pure iron powder. The alloyed steel powder usually<br>
contains chromium which under the prevailing sintering<br>
conditions of about 1100°C is one of the most mobile<br>
element atoms after carbon, in terms of rate of<br>
diffusion, of those alloying elements which promote the<br>
formation of martensite on cooling of the article<br>
following sintering. Carbon atoms are the most mobile,<br>
moving into the interstices of the iron atoms in the<br>
crystal structure. However, since chromium is of a<br>
similar atomic size and weight to iron it substitutes for<br>
iron and consequently has a similar mobility to iron<br>
under the prevailing sintering conditions. The presence<br>
of chromium promotes the formation of martensite in those<br>
regions of the sintered material into which it diffuses,<br>
the martensite being formed on cooling of the material at<br>
the end of the sintering cycle. Sintering is frequently<br>
effected for such articles in furnaces which have<br>
continuous moving means, such as a belt or a walking-beam<br>
type mechanism, for transporting the articles, generally<br>
supported on trays for example, through the furnace.<br>
Generally, a first portion of the furnace raises the<br>
temperature of the articles to the sintering temperature;<br>
a second portion maintains the articles at the sintering<br>
temperature; and, a third portion allows the articles to<br>
cool from the sintering temperature to a temperature<br>
which will preclude significant oxidation of the articles<br>
on exit from the sintering furnace. The articles are<br>
generally sintered under a continuous protective gas<br>
atmosphere flowing through the furnace which serves to<br>
provide either a neutral or reducing atmosphere and<br>
preclude air (oxygen) from entering the furnace. The<br>
atmosphere is at substantially atmospheric pressure with<br>
only a slight positive pressure within the furnace to<br>
prevent air from entering therein. Where the sintered<br>
material contains a significant quantity of iron powder<br>
in the original mix it is frequently found that the iron<br>
grains resulting from the sintering of the compacted iron<br>
powder particles possess a microstructure ranging from<br>
ferrite to pearlite and mixtures of the two phases,<br>
depending upon the carbon content, in the core of the<br>
iron-rich non-tool steel regions. The outer region of the<br>
iron grains generally comprises martensite resulting from<br>
chromium which has diffused in during the sintering<br>
operation but the core remains essentially as ferrite or<br>
pearlite or a mixture of ferrite and pearlite depending<br>
upon the added carbon level. In the as-sintered<br>
condition, the iron-rich non-tool steel phase or grain<br>
structure consists of mainly pearlite, though there may<br>
be some ferrite, at the centre and the outer regions of<br>
the grains are a mixture of martensite/bainite. If there<br>
is any retained austenite in the sintered article it is<br>
generally transformed by cryogenic treatment after<br>
sintering. During a tempering operation usually carried<br>
out after cryogenic treatment, partial decomposition of<br>
the pearlite phase occurs leading to the formation of<br>
ferrite areas within the iron-rich grains or phase. This<br>
can result in the material having inferior wear<br>
properties due to the presence of ferrite and also lower<br>
strength due to the ferrite. The post-sintering thermal<br>
treatments comprising cryogenic treatment to transform<br>
any remaining y-phase (austenite) to martensite followed<br>
by tempering treatments are to reduce the degree of<br>
hardness and brittleness of the martensite phase rather<br>
than to effect decomposition of the pearlite which is an<br>
undesirable side effect of the tempering process. Since<br>
the tempering treatment is carried out at a temperature<br>
in excess of the expected service temperature, size<br>
stability of the article in its service environment (e.g.<br>
a valve seat insert in the combustion chamber of an<br>
internal combustion engine) is ensured. However, such<br>
treatments do not affect the presence (other than to be<br>
responsible for generating at least a proportion of the<br>
ferrite) of the ferrite phase or its inherently poor wear<br>
and mechanical properties.<br>
It has been found that with the method of the present<br>
invention that there appears to be a synergistic effect<br>
of the copper (either from the diffusion-bonded form or<br>
in the pre-alloyed form with the iron) and chromium<br>
together in promoting the diffusion of copper and<br>
chromium towards the centre of the iron grains and,<br>
instead of the core of the iron grains remaining as<br>
ferrite or pearlite or a mixture of these, the core of<br>
the iron grains is found to transform to martensite<br>
during normal furnace cooling. Sintered ferrous materials<br>
made according to the process of the present invention<br>
using either pre-alloyed iron-copper or diffusion bonded<br>
iron-copper powders reveal the presence of martensite in<br>
the cores of the iron-rich grains due to the diffusion of<br>
chromium or other martensite promoting elements into the<br>
iron grains. The martensite is formed during the cooling<br>
of austenite and any retained austenite is transformed by<br>
cryogenic treatment following sintering. During the<br>
cooling process from the sintering temperature some of<br>
the austenite can also transform to bainite. The<br>
martensite may then be tempered to form a structure of<br>
tempered martensite which is readily machinable. However,<br>
it is important to note that the previously soft<br>
ferritic/pearlitic cores of the iron grains now comprise<br>
material which is harder, stronger and more wear<br>
resistant due to the process of the present invention. It<br>
is believed that the processing used to form the pre-<br>
alloyed and diffusion bonded iron-copper material causes<br>
at least some diffusion of the copper phase into the iron<br>
constituent and the presence of the copper assists in the<br>
diffusion of chromium and other martensite promoting<br>
elements into the cores of the iron grains formed on<br>
sintering thus, enabling martensite to be formed.<br>
Tests making materials according to the method of the<br>
present invention and making substantially identical<br>
materials by prior art infiltration processes, but using<br>
substantially identical processing parameters of pressing<br>
pressure and sintering temperature for example, have<br>
shown the beneficial effects of using an iron-copper pre-<br>
alloy or diffusion bonded powder as described<br>
hereinabove. Materials of largely identical composition<br>
except for the copper content were made by 1) the method<br>
of the present invention; 2) by the route of simultaneous<br>
sintering and infiltration; and, 3) by adding 13 weight%<br>
elemental copper powder to the initial powder mixture and<br>
sintering (i.e. without infiltration and without the<br>
addition of pre-alloyed iron-copper powder).<br>
Materials made by conventional infiltration techniques<br>
under the same processing conditions do not show the<br>
beneficial effect of martensite formation in the iron<br>
grain core. Analysis by scanning electron microscope has<br>
shown the presence of chromium in the particle core in<br>
materials made by the method of the present invention. It<br>
is to be emphasised that the processing conditions used<br>
in the comparative tests are the same processing<br>
conditions used for production of commercial prior art<br>
materials and thus represent the current optimum<br>
processing conditions taking all factors into account.<br>
Materials made according to the method of the present<br>
invention may also receive post-sintering thermal<br>
treatments such as cryogenic treatment at -120°C or below<br>
to convert any residual austenite phase to martensite,<br>
followed by tempering to make the martensite softer, more<br>
dimensionally stable and make it amenable to machining.<br>
Thus, according to a feature of one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the powder mixture contains a powder<br>
component comprising a relatively un~alloyed iron powder<br>
and a powder component comprising a steel powder<br>
containing at least some chromium or other martensite<br>
promoting element as an alloying element in addition to<br>
the pre-alloyed or diffusion bonded iron-copper powder.<br>
Alternatively or additionally the powder mixture may<br>
contain addition(s) of elemental martensite promoting<br>
material such as molybdenum and/or nickel for example.<br>
Examples utilising M3/2 high speed steel powders are<br>
described herein, however, any other suitable tool steel<br>
or high speed steel, for example, chromium-containing<br>
steel powder may be employed depending upon the<br>
application in which the article produced therefrom is to<br>
be used.<br>
An example of an. alternative steel material is so-called<br>
316 steel which is a stainless steel comprising in<br>
weight%: 17 Cr/ 2 Mo/ 13 Ni/ Bal Fe and which is<br>
substantially carbon free.<br>
Thus, it appears that the manner in which copper . is<br>
introduced into the sintered ferrous material, i.e. by<br>
being associated with the iron where there has been prior<br>
treatment causing reaction therebetween, has an<br>
unexpected and synergistic effect in aiding diffusion of<br>
chromium or other martensite promoting elements through<br>
the iron matrix to assist in the transformation to<br>
martensite on cooling after sintering or by<br>
transformation of retained austenite by cryogenic<br>
treatment.<br>
The composition of the iron-copper pre-alloyed or<br>
diffusion-bonded material may be any desired, e.g. iron-<br>
2 0 copper. Powder mixtures may be made up having powder<br>
components comprising: iron; iron-copper; pre-alloyed<br>
steel powder; and, carbon powder, for example. The amount<br>
of iron-copper pre-alloy powder will depend upon the<br>
final required copper content in the article and on the<br>
initial composition of the iron-copper pre-alloy powder.<br>
The use of iron-copper pre-alloyed and/or diffusion<br>
bonded material in a powder mixture together with an<br>
addition on elemental copper powder is not precluded and<br>
in some circumstances may be beneficial. The use of both<br>
pre-alloyed and diffusion bonded iron-copper powder may<br>
also be employed in a powder mixture.<br>
The pre-alloyed iron-copper material appears to be<br>
somewhat more effective in promoting the formation of<br>
martensite in iron grains than does diffusion bonded<br>
iron-copper material. Therefore, the use of the pre-<br>
alloyed material is preferred, however, it is pointed out<br>
that the diffusion bonded material produces martensite<br>
after sintering and subsequent processing whereas prior<br>
art infiltrated materials do not produce any martensite<br>
in the iron grain cores, the cores comprising only<br>
mixtures of pearlite and ferrite.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a sintered article produced by the<br>
first aspect of the present invention.<br>
In order that the present invention may be more fully<br>
understood, examples will now be described by way of<br>
illustration only with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, of which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a histogram showing wear of valve seat<br>
inserts in an engine test on material made according to .<br>
the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 which shows a graph of tool wear vs number of<br>
parts machined for materials made according to the<br>
present invention and prior art material.<br>
Example 1 was a material prepared by the method of the<br>
present invention where all of the iron and a proportion<br>
of the copper were added as pre-alloyed iron-20 copper<br>
powder. The pre-alloy powder contributes about 9.5<br>
weight% of copper to the final material. A further 6<br>
weight% of elemental copper powder was added to the<br>
initial powder mixture to bring the total copper up to 15<br>
weight%. The steel pre-alloy powder was a water atomised<br>
M3/2 powder having a nominal composition of: 1 C; 4 Cr; 5<br>
Mo; 3 V; 5 W. Since only 6 weight% of elemental copper<br>
powder was added, segregation was minimised.<br>
Example la is powder mixture wherein all of the iron<br>
powder content is provided as pure iron powder and the<br>
copper content as 13 weight% of elemental copper powder.<br>
Whilst such material would not normally be made with such<br>
a high content of elemental copper powder for the reasons<br>
discussed hereinbefore, the material was made to<br>
Valve Seat Insert Material- Example 1<br>
Ferrous powder mixtures of a typical composition used in<br>
the production of valve seat inserts for internal<br>
combustion engines were prepared by various routes. The<br>
compositions of the powder mixtures in terms of the<br>
actual constituent component powders used to make them<br>
were as set out below in Table 1:<br>
determine the effect of the copper content on the<br>
diffusion characteristics of the chromium into the iron<br>
constituent.<br>
Example 1b was made by the prior art process according to<br>
GB-A-2 188 062 wherein the copper is supplied via a<br><br>
simultaneous sintering and infiltration step.<br>
All of the powders were blended according to established<br>
principles in a Y-cone mixer. Compaction pressure was in<br>
the range 650-800MPa in each case followed by sintering<br>
at around 1100°C in a conveyor furnace, all Examples<br>
being sintered under the same conditions. Following<br>
sintering all Examples were cryogenically treated at<br>
12C°C to transform any remaining austenite (y-phase) in<br>
the structure and then tempered at 600°C for 2 hours to<br>
soften the martensite, make it more dimensionally stable<br>
and enhance machinability qualities.<br>
Table 2 below gives the actual compositions in terms of<br>
the constituent elements, the density of the sintered<br>
material and its final hardness following cryogenic and<br>
tempering post-sintering treatment.<br>
The microstructure of samples made according to Example 1<br>
showed a tempered martensite structure even in the cores<br>
of the iron grains. The martensite was formed on cooling<br>
from the sintering temperature. Cryogenic treatment was<br>
used to transform any retained austenite in the M3/2<br>
phase of the material to martensite. The change from<br>
austenite to martensite is not easily seen under the<br>
microscope, the change being evidenced by increased<br>
hardness on the change from austenite to martensite.<br>
Samples from Example la showed a microstructure<br>
comprising some martensite formed on cooling from the<br>
sintering temperature and retained austenite. Following<br>
cryogenic treatment, the retained austenite transformed<br>
to martensite in the M3/2 regions and the iron grains<br>
comprised mainly pearlite (a phase comprising a lamellar<br>
structure of ferrite and cementite) and some ferrite. The<br>
pearlite was formed by virtue of the carbon powder added<br>
as graphite, however, owing to the absence of chromium in<br>
the iron grain cores, no martensite was formed. On<br>
tempering, extensive decomposition of pearlite took place<br>
and the volume fraction of ferrite increased compared<br>
with that of the as-sintered state. Thus, the wear<br>
resistance of Example la material is inferior and the<br>
mechanical properties, as evidenced by the hardness<br>
figures, are also inferior.<br>
Samples from Example 1b demonstrated almost identical<br>
structure and properties as did Example la. This material<br>
was made according to the known process of GB-A-2 188<br>
062^, The hardness of Example lb was slightly higher than<br>
Example 1, this being attributed to the higher density of<br>
the material following infiltration. However, the<br>
material of Example lb showed extensive quantities of<br>
inherently weaker ferrite areas after tempering and not<br>
the desirable tempered martensite structure shown by<br>
Example 1 made according to the process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a histogram of valve seat insert wear of<br>
valve seat inserts, made from the material of Example 1,<br>
in the exhaust positions of a 1.81, 4-cylinder, 16-valve<br>
engine which was run for 180 hours at 6000 rev/min on<br>
unleaded gasoline, the engine having Stellite (trade<br>
name) faced valves. The success criteria for this test is<br>
that valve seat insert wear must not exceed 100mm. As may<br>
be seen from Fig.l the maximum wear was at valve seat<br>
position 4 at 60mm, all other inserts having wear of<br>
about 30pm or less.<br>
Thus, it is clear from Examples 1, la and 1b that the<br>
only substantive difference in the manufacture thereof<br>
was the manner in which the copper was introduced into<br>
the sintered material. It is believed that the improved<br>
structure and properties are directly attributable to the<br>
use of the iron-copper pre-alloyed materials wherein at<br>
least a proportion of the copper is indivisibly<br>
associated with the iron and stem from the enhanced<br>
diffusion promoted by this pre-alloyed material.<br>
Example 2<br>
A powder mixture comprising 45 wt% M3/2 tool steel<br>
powder/ 0.55C/ 1 MoS2 / 6 Cu/ 47.45 FeCu20 (diffusion<br>
bonded powder)/ 0.75 lubricating wax was made. This<br>
mixture was compacted into green compacts at 770MPa to a<br>
green density 7.1 Mgm-3 and sintered at about 1100°C under<br>
a continuous flowing nitrogen-hydrogen gas atmosphere in<br>
a conveyor furnace. The sintered articles were<br>
cryogenically treated at -120°C or below to convert<br>
retained austenite to martensite and finally tempered at<br>
600°C. Density of the sintered material was 7.0 Mgm3. The<br>
hardness of the as sintered material was 61HRA; that of<br>
the cryogenically treated material 65HRA; and that of the<br>
cryogenically treated and tempered material 62-65 HRA.<br>
The microstructure of the Example 2 material (made with<br>
diffusion-bonded iron-copper powder) after tempering ,<br>
(following sintering and cryogenic treatment) showed some<br>
small occasional areas of ferrite in the iron-rich non-<br>
tool steel phase. However, this iron-rich phase comprised<br>
essentially pearlite rather than the extensive regions of<br>
ferrite typified by the prior art material made using the<br>
infiltration technique.<br>
Example 3<br>
A mixture comprising in weight%: 75% pre-alloyed Fe-Cu20<br>
powder/ 23% 316 stainless steel powder/ 0.75% MoS2<br>
powder/ 1% carbon powder was prepared; this material<br>
being coded Nl. The composition of the 316 stainless<br>
steel was 17 Cr/ 2 Mo/ 13 Ni/ bal Fe. A comparative<br>
example coded N was made from the following mixture in<br>
weight%: 70.9% unalloyed iron powder/ 27% 316 stainless<br>
steel powder/ 0.9% MoS2 powder/ 1.2% carbon powder. Both<br>
materials were compacted at 770MPa. However, material Nl<br>
was sintered only (as there was about 15 wt% Cu provided<br>
by the Fe-Cu pre-alloy) and material N was simultaneously<br>
sintered and infiltrated according to the known prior art<br>
process. The final theoretical overall composition of<br>
both materials Nl and N in weight% was: 1 C/3.9 Cr/15<br>
Cu/0.9 Mo/3 Ni/S 0.3/bal Fe. The sintering/infiltration<br>
steps were carried out at about 1100°C under a flowing<br>
nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere. Both materials following<br>
sintering were cryogenically treated and tempered.<br>
The Nl material showed a microstructure having no<br>
ferrite, even in the cores of the grains which were<br>
predominantly iron. The structure of this material showed<br>
essentially a tempered martensite structure. The N<br>
material on the other hand showed extensive ferrite in<br>
the iron grains with a pearlitic structure in the<br>
transition zones between prior iron particles and 316<br>
stainless steel particles even though this material had<br>
slightly higher carbon at 1.2%. Thus, again the influence<br>
of the copper being indivisibly associated with the iron<br>
is shown in the resulting structure after processing.<br>
Example 4<br>
Further mixtures denoted as material FMCA and FMCD were<br>
made according to the present invention. The blend<br>
compositions of these materials in terms of the<br>
constituents in the powder mixtures are given below in<br>
Table 3.<br>
The materials were compacted at 770 MPa and sintered at<br>
about 1100°C under a continuous gaseous atmosphere as<br>
with previous examples. The resulting densities and<br>
hardnesses of the sintered materials are given below in<br>
Table 3<br>
 FMCA 1 FMCD<br>
Fe-20 Cu (pre-alloyed) 75 75<br>
C 1.35 1.35<br>
Mo 0.5 ______________________<br>
MoS2________________________1_________________<br>
Unalloyed Fe_____________23.15 22.65<br>
Lubricating wax__________ 0.75 0.75______________<br>
Table 4. For these samples no post-sintering heat<br>
treatment was carried out.<br>
In the FMCA material made according to the present<br>
invention pre-alloyed Fe-Cu powder and 0.5% elemental Mo<br>
powder were used in the initial powder mixture. The FMCA<br>
material showed extensive Mo-rich zones and martensitic<br>
and bainitic areas associated with these zones. The FMCA<br>
material also showed grain boundary carbides. The<br>
microstructure of the FMCA material was somewhat" similar<br>
to a comparative material, coded FMC (unalloyed iron<br>
powder, 1.35% C, 0.5% Mo), wherein the copper content was<br>
provided by a simultaneous sintering and infiltration<br>
process according to the prior art. Apart from the<br>
infiltration step, the sintering conditions were the same<br>
as those for the FMCA and FMCD materials. In the FMC<br>
material grain boundary carbide was present, the matrix<br>
was pearlite and the Mo-rich zones associated with the Mo<br>
particles were present but very small compared with the<br>
FMCA material.<br>
During sintering, the MoS2 in the FMCD material undergoes<br>
partial decomposition and donates free Mo to the<br>
structure which potentially is able to generate a<br>
localised martensitic/bainitic structure associated with<br>
the Mo-rich zones. Some of the sulphur from decomposed<br>
MoS2 reacts with iron and copper to form metallic<br>
sulphides which are beneficial for improving<br>
machinability. In the FMCD material no carbide networks<br>
could be seen and the matrix was pearlitic.<br>
Figure 2 shows a graph of tool wear vs number of parts<br>
 machined for FMC, FMCA and FMCD materials. The Figure<br>
confirms that the materials using pre-alloyed Fe-Cu<br>
powders which give rise to extensive martensitic/bainitic<br>
areas do not have their machinability impaired in spite<br>
of the stronger, more wear resistant material structures<br>
 so formed. Indeed, the machinability of the both the FMCA<br>
and FMCD materials is superior to the FMC material made<br>
by a prior art process.<br>
