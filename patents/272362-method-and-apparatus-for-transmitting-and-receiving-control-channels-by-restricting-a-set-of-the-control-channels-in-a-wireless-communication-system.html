				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING<br>
CONTROL CHANNELS BY RESTRICTING A SET OF THE CONTROL<br>
CHANNELS IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a wireless communication<br>
system, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for transmitting and<br>
receiving control channels in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) system.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, in wireless communication systems, intensive research is being<br>
conducted on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) as a useful scheme<br>
for high-speed data transmission in wireless channels.<br>
OFDM, a scheme for transmitting data using multiple carriers, is a type of<br>
Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) that converts a serial input symbol stream into<br>
parallel symbol streams and modulates each of the parallel symbol streams with<br>
multiple orthogonal subcarriers or subcarrier channels before transmission.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a transmitter in a<br>
conventional OFDM system. Referring to FIG. 1, an OFDM transmitter includes<br>
an encoder 101, a modulator 102, a serial-to-parallel converter 103, an Inverse<br>
Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) block 104, a parallel-to-serial converter 105, and a<br>
Cyclic Prefix (CP) inserter 106. The encoder 101, i.e.. a channel encoding block,<br>
performs channel encoding on a specific input information bit stream. Generally,<br>
a convolutional encoder, a turbo encoder, or a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC)<br>
encoder is used as the encoder 101. The modulator 102 generates modulation<br>
symbols by performing modulation, such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying<br>
(QPSK), 8-ary Phase Shift Keying (8PSK), 16-ary Quadrature Amplitude<br>
Modulation (16QAM), 64QAM, and 256QAM, on the output of the encoder 101.<br>
Although not illustrated in FIG. 1, a rate matching block for performing repetition<br>
and puncturing can be further included between the encoder 101 and the<br>
modulator 102. The serial-to-parallel converter 103 serves to convert the serial<br>
output of the modulator 102 into parallel data.<br>
The IFFT block 104 performs an IFFT operation on the output of the<br>
serial-to-parallel converter 103. The output of the IFFT block 104 is converted<br>
into serial data by the parallel-to-serial converter 105. Thereafter, the CP inserter<br>
106 inserts a CP code into the output of the parallel-to-serial converter 105.<br>
The Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, which is now under discussion<br>
as the next generation wireless communication system of the Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication Service (UMTS) system in the 3rd Generation Partnership<br>
Project (3GPP) standardization organization, uses Single Carrier Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) for the uplink to solve the high Peak-to-<br>
Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem of OFDMA. SC-FDMA, a type of OFDM,<br>
can be realized by adding an FFT block to a front of the IFFT block 104 and pre-<br>
coding pre-IFFT data.<br>
FIG. 2 conceptually illustrates resources of a conventional OFDM system.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, in OFDM or SC-FDMA, wireless resources are expressed<br>
as a two-dimensional time-frequency array. More specifically, the horizontal axis<br>
represents a time domain 201 and the vertical axis represents a frequency domain<br>
202. In the time domain 201, 7 OFDM symbols constitute one slot 204, and two<br>
slots constitute one subframe 205. Generally, one sub frame 205 has the same<br>
length as a Transmission Time Interval (TTI), which is the basic transmission unit.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a data transmission and reception procedure between a<br>
base station and a terminal in a conventional OFDM system. Referring to FIG. 3,<br>
in step 303, a terminal 302 generates a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)<br>
indicating a downlink channel state based on a received Reference Signal (RS)<br>
transmitted by a base station 301, and transmits the CQI to the base station 301 in<br>
step 304. In this case, the terminal 302 can transmit a Channel Sounding<br>
Reference Signal (CS/RS) along with the CQI in order for the base station 301 to<br>
identify the uplink channel state.<br>
Upon receiving the CQI and/or the CS/RS, the base station 301<br>
determines downlink or uplink resources it will allocate to the terminal 302<br>
through scheduling in step 305, and transmits a scheduling grant indicating the<br>
determined downlink/uplink resources to the terminal 302 in step 306. The<br>
terminal 302 first determines if the scheduling grant has been delivered to the<br>
terminal 302 itself. If the scheduling grant has been delivered to the terminal 302,<br>
the terminal 302 recognizes the allocated downlink/uplink resources indicated by<br>
the scheduling grant in step 307, and exchanges data with the base station 301<br>
using the allocated downlink/uplink resources in step 308.<br>
The base station 301 delivers the information necessary for data<br>
transmission/reception to the terminal 302 using a scheduling grant, and the<br>
scheduling grant is transmitted to the terminal 302 through a Physical Downlink<br>
Control Channel (PDCCH). The PDCCH uses some of the resources illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2. The base station 301 selects one or multiple PDCCHs from among a<br>
plurality of available PDCCHs, and transmits the scheduling grant to the terminal<br>
302 through the selected PDCCH(s).<br>
Because the terminal 302 does not know which channel among the<br>
multiple PDCCHs transmitted by the base station 301 is used for the terminal 302,<br>
the terminal 302 must monitor all PDCCHs transmitted by the base station 301 to<br>
determine if there is a PDCCH having a scheduling grant being transmitted to the<br>
terminal 302. In this case, if the number of PDCCHs transmitted by the base<br>
station 301 is great, the terminal 302 must perform a large number of reception<br>
operations to check the scheduling grant, requiring complicated reception<br>
structure and increasing power waste of the terminal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for clarity and conciseness. Terms used herein are defined based<br>
on functions in the present invention and may vary according to users, operator<br>
intention, or usual practices. Therefore, the definitions of the terms should be<br>
made based on the contents throughout the specification. Although a description<br>
of the present invention will be given herein with reference to the LTE system, by<br>
way of example, the present invention can be applied to other wireless<br>
communication systems to which base station scheduling is applied, without any<br>
modification.<br>
The present invention restricts a set of control channels being monitored<br>
by a terminal among all available control channels transmittable by a base station<br>
in delivering control information for data transmission and reception to the<br>
terminal in a wireless communication system. That is, the present invention<br>
presents a scheme for reducing a procedure that a terminal should perform, by<br>
restricting the number of control channels that the terminal should receive and<br>
decode. Accordingly, the present invention simplifies a structure of the terminal,<br>
and enables the terminal to monitor control channels thereby reducing the battery<br>
consumption.<br>
A description of an embodiment of the present invention will be given<br>
herein with reference to a PDCCH, as a control channel, for carrying a scheduling<br>
grant for data transmission and reception between a base station and a terminal.<br>
However, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to<br>
transmission and reception of PDCCH.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates resource mapping between control channels according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, in the entire<br>
frequency bandwidth (or system bandwidth) 401, the smallest time unit of<br>
resources is a slot 403 that includes, for example, 7 OFDM symbols, and 2 slots<br>
constitute one subframe 402. The subframe 402 is the smallest unit for resource<br>
allocation, and generally has the same length as a Transmission Time Interval<br>
(TTI), which is a data transmission unit. PDCCHs are mapped to several leading<br>
OFDM symbols 404 (hereinafter referred to as a "control channel resource<br>
region") among the multiple OFDM symbols included in the subframe 402, and<br>
Physical Downlink Shared Channels (PDSCHs), on which packet data are carried,<br>
are mapped to the remaining OFDM symbols 405.<br>
PDCCHs for downlink and uplink transmission for multiple terminals<br>
exist in the control channel resource region 404, and each PDCCH is generated as<br>
described below. That is, a Control Channel Element (CCE) with a predetermined<br>
size is used to generate PDCCH, and one PDCCH includes at least one CCE. That<br>
is, a base station transmits control information to a terminal having a good<br>
channel state using a PDCCH including one CCE, i.e., by applying a high code<br>
rate. However, the base station transmits the same sized control information to a<br>
terminal having a poor channel state using a PDCCH including multiple CCEs.<br>
i.e., by applying a low code rate. Accordingly, even the terminal in the poor<br>
channel condition can stably receive control information through the PDCCH.<br>
For example, PDCCH candidates 407 are generated using CCE sets<br>
including 1 CCE 408, 2 CCEs 409, 4 CCEs 410 or 8 CCEs. etc among multiple<br>
CCEs 406 existing in the entire control channel resource region 404. When the<br>
total number of CCEs is defined as N, N PDCCH candidates 406 are generated<br>
when 1 CCE is used for each PDCCH; [N/2] PDCCH candidates are generated<br>
when 2 CCEs are used for each PDCCH; [N/4] PDCCH candidates are generated<br>
when 4 CCEs are used for each PDCCH; and [N/8] PDCCH candidates are<br>
generated when 8 CCEs are used for each PDCCH. Here, [A] indicates the<br>
maximum integer not greater than A.<br>
More specifically, in the example illustrated in FIG. 4, PDCCHs 411 and<br>
412 each are allocated to each terminal using one CCE, PDCCH 413 is allocated<br>
using two CCEs, and PDCCH 414 is allocated using four CCEs. The PDCCHs<br>
411, 412, 413, and 414 are mapped 415 to the above-stated control channel<br>
resource region 404.<br>
The control channel resource region 404, to which multiple PDCCHs are<br>
mapped 415, uses a maximum of several OFDM symbols in one subframe. In this<br>
case, the number of simultaneously used PDCCHs, or the number of necessary<br>
CCEs, can vary every time, based on the number of terminals currently available<br>
and channel states of the terminals, and a size of the control channel resource<br>
region 404 for PDCCHs is variable as illustrates by reference numeral 416. The<br>
LTE system can change a size 416 of the control channel resource region 404, in<br>
which PDCCH(s) are included, using periodic information, and particular<br>
information (hereinafter referred to as "Category_0 information (Cat0)" or<br>
"Control Channel Format Indicator (CCFI)") mapped to a predetermined OFDM<br>
symbol (for example, the first OFDM symbol) of each subframe, or system<br>
information transmitted through a Broadcast Channel (BCH) (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "BCH information") is used as an example of the periodic<br>
information.<br>
A terminal monitors only a set of PDCCHs transmittable to the terminal<br>
among all PDCCH candidates transmittable by a base station, without receiving<br>
and decoding all of the multiple PDCCH candidates every time to determine if<br>
there is control information scheduled to the terminal. The base station transmits a<br>
scheduling grant to the terminal using only the restricted set of PDCCHs. Because<br>
all the PDCCH candidates can vary depending on the periodic information<br>
transmitted by the base station, the set of PDCCHs restricted to the terminal is<br>
also subject to change according to the periodic information.<br>
FIGs. 5A and 5B illustrate a variable set of PDCCHs that a terminal<br>
monitors depending on a change in all PDCCH candidates according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5A, a base station can use<br>
4 CCEs 501 to generate PDCCHs. Therefore, the total number of PDCCH<br>
candidates 502 is 7. That is, if the possible number of CCEs, with which PDCCH<br>
can be generated, is 1, 2, and 4, four PDCCH candidates #1, #2, #3, and #4 using<br>
one CCE, two PDCCH candidates #5 and #6 using two CCEs, and one PDCCH<br>
candidate #7 using four CCEs are generated. For example, in FIG. 5A, in the<br>
entire PDCCH candidate set 502, a first monitoring set 507 indicating PDCCHs<br>
that a terminal monitors is restricted to two PDCCHs 503 and 504 using one CCE.<br>
one PDCCH 505 using two CCEs, and one PDCCH 506 using four CCEs. That is.<br>
the first monitoring set 507 is restricted to a PDCCH candidate #1 503, a PDCCH<br>
candidate #3 504, a PDCCH candidate #5 505, and a PDCCH candidate #7 506<br>
according to a predetermined rule. Thereafter, the base station uses one of the<br>
PDCCH candidates in the first monitoring set 507 to transmit control information<br>
to the terminal.<br>
Upon detecting a situation where it should increase the number of<br>
PDCCHs for the terminal, the base station increases the number of CCEs 511<br>
used for the PDCCHs to, for example, 8, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, and transmits<br>
periodic information in order to notify the increase to the terminal. Thereafter, the<br>
total number of PDCCH candidates 512 increases to 14, so that PDCCH<br>
candidates transmittable to the terminal change as a second monitoring set 517.<br>
More specifically, referring to FIG. 5B, a PDCCH candidate set 512<br>
includes 8 PDCCH candidates PDCCH #1-#8 using one CCE, 4 PDCCH<br>
candidates PDCCH #9-#12 using two CCEs, and 2 PDCCH candidates PDCCH<br>
#13 and #14 using four CCEs. In the PDCCH candidate set 512, the second<br>
monitoring set 517 for a terminal is restricted to, for example, PDCCH candidate<br>
#2 513, PDCCH candidate #6 514, PDCCH candidate #10 515, and PDCCH<br>
candidate #14 516 according to a predetermined rule. Therefore, the base station<br>
uses one of the PDCCH candidates in the second monitoring set 517 to transmit<br>
control information to the terminal.<br>
The number of CCEs constituting each PDCCH can be considered as a<br>
rule for determining a monitoring set of a control channel for the terminal. When<br>
the total number of PDCCH candidates 502 is 7, as in FIG. 5A, two PDCCHs 503<br>
and 504 using one CCE, one PDCCH 505 using two CCEs, and one PDCCH 506<br>
using four CCEs can be restrictively used for the terminal. When the total number<br>
of PDCCH candidates 512 is 14, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, two PDCCHs 513 and<br>
514 using one CCE, one PDCCH 515 using two CCEs, and one PDCCH 516<br>
using four CCEs are restrictively used for the terminal.<br>
Therefore, in restricting the monitoring set of PDCCH candidates for a<br>
terminal, the present invention can secure various numbers of CCEs for PDCCHs<br>
that the terminal monitors, by applying an independent rule according to the<br>
number of CCEs per PDCCH. The application of an independent rule for the<br>
number of CCEs per PDCCH enables maximal inclusion of the different numbers<br>
of CCEs per PDCCH in the monitoring set, so that the terminal can use PDCCHs<br>
composed of different numbers of CCEs according to the channel condition.<br>
With reference to FIGs. 6 and 7, a description will now be made of a<br>
transmission operation of a base station and a reception operation of a terminal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Because periodic<br>
information from the base station is subject to change every scheduling time (or<br>
every subframe), establishment of a monitoring set can also be made every<br>
scheduling time.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a transmission operation of a base station<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, a base<br>
station performs scheduling on terminals in step 602, and in step 603, determines<br>
if it should perform scheduling on a particular terminal. If it is determined in step<br>
603 that no scheduling happens on the terminal, i.e., if the terminal is not<br>
scheduled, the base station performs scheduling on other terminals in step 603.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 603 that scheduling should happen on the<br>
terminal and thus data transmission and/or reception of the terminal is scheduled,<br>
the base station sets (determines) a number of CCEs constituting PDCCH<br>
according to the channel state of the terminal in step 604. In step 605, the terminal<br>
establishes a monitoring set, or a set of PDCCH candidates that the terminal can<br>
receive while satisfying the determined number of CCEs per PDCCH.<br>
In establishing the monitoring set, the base station may use at least one of<br>
(i) periodic information CatO and BCH that the base station transmits to the<br>
terminal, (ii) upper layer signaling information given to the terminal, and (iii) a<br>
terminal identifier (ID).<br>
In step 606. the base station determines if there is an available PDCCH,<br>
unused for other terminals, in the monitoring set. If there is no available PDCCH,<br>
the base station performs scheduling on other terminals in step 602, and if there is<br>
an available PDCCH, the base station transmits a scheduling grant to the terminal<br>
using the PDCCH and performs packet data transmission and/or reception<br>
according to the scheduling grant in step 607.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a reception operation of a terminal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, a<br>
terminal establishes a monitoring set, or a set of receivable PDCCH candidates in<br>
step 702. In establishing the monitoring set, the terminal may use at least one of<br>
(i) periodic information CatO and BCH that a base station transmits to the<br>
terminal, (ii) upper layer signaling information given to the terminal, and (iii) a<br>
terminal ID.<br>
The terminal monitors and receives each of multiple PDCCHs<br>
corresponding to the monitoring set in step 703, and in step 704, determines if the<br>
base station has transmitted a scheduling grant to the terminal through one of the<br>
PDCCHs. More specifically, the terminal determines if the control information<br>
received through each of the multiple PDCCHs has been transmitted to the<br>
terminal itself, and if control information for the corresponding terminal is<br>
detected from at least one PDCCH the terminal performs packet data transmission<br>
and/or reception using the scheduling grant in step 705. However, if no<br>
scheduling grant for the corresponding terminal has been received in step 704, the<br>
terminal ends the reception operation.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter structure of a base<br>
station according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 8.<br>
a monitoring set establisher 803 included in a scheduler 801 of a base station<br>
establishes a monitoring set, or a set of PDCCHs allowed for each terminal in<br>
communication. In establishing the monitoring set, the monitoring set establisher<br>
803 may use at least one of periodic information 802, such as CatO, and BCH that<br>
a base station transmits to all terminals, and additional information 804 including<br>
upper layer signaling information given to a terminal, and a terminal ID. Further,<br>
a CCE count determiner 806 sets (or determines) a number of CCEs necessary for<br>
generating PDCCH of the terminal according to channel information 805<br>
determined depending on CQI that the terminal transmits to the base station, and<br>
provides the determined number of CCEs per PDCCH for the monitoring set<br>
establisher 803 to use in establishing a monitoring set of PDCCHs.<br>
A data scheduler 807 performs scheduling using the channel information<br>
805 of the terminal, and buffer information 809 indicating the amount of data that<br>
the base station intends to transmit to the terminal. If there is a need for data<br>
transmission and/or reception for the terminal as the terminal is scheduled, a<br>
PDCCH selector 808 selects one currently available PDCCH among the PDCCHs<br>
included in the monitoring set established for the terminal. A PDCCH generator<br>
811 generates control information, i.e., scheduling grant, according to the PDCCH<br>
selected by the PDCCH selector 808, and inputs it to a multiplexer 820. Here, the<br>
PDCCH selector 808 and the PDCCH generator 811 constitute a PDCCH<br>
transmission unit.<br>
A PDSCH generator 810 generates packet data with a predetermined size<br>
according to the scheduling result of the data scheduler 807. and inputs the packet<br>
data to the multiplexer 820. The packet data is generated when downlink data is<br>
scheduled, and no packet data is generated when uplink data is scheduled. The<br>
multiplexer (MUX) 820 multiplexes input information and transmits the<br>
multiplexed information via a transmission unit 830.<br>
FIG. 9 is block diagram illustrating a receiver structure of a terminal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, a<br>
reception unit 901 of a terminal receives a signal from a base station, and a<br>
demultiplexer 902 demultiplexes the received signal into channel signals. In<br>
demultiplexing a PDCCH signal, a monitoring set establisher 903 uses a<br>
monitoring set indicating PDCCHs, which are set to be receivable for the terminal.<br>
That is, the monitoring set establisher 903 establishes a monitoring set including<br>
PDCCHs that the terminal monitors according to the same rule based on the same<br>
information as that of the monitoring set establisher 803 of the base station, and<br>
controls the demultiplexer 902 to perform demultiplexing on the PDCCHs<br>
belonging to the monitoring set. Because at least one of periodic information 904,<br>
such as CatO, and BCH that a base station transmits to all terminals, and<br>
additional information 905 including upper layer signaling information for a<br>
terminal and a terminal ID is used for establishing the monitoring set, the<br>
monitoring sets established separately by the base station and the terminal include<br>
the same PDCCHs.<br>
The channel signals demultiplexed by the demultiplexer 902 are delivered<br>
to corresponding channel decoders 906 and 907. Particularly, the PDCCH signals<br>
of the monitoring set controlled by the monitoring set establisher 903 are input to<br>
a PDCCH decoder 907. The PDCCH decoder 907 determines if a scheduling<br>
grant is included in the PDCCH signals, and if it is included, provides the<br>
scheduling grant to a data transmission/reception unit (not shown) in order to<br>
perform data transmission/reception according to the scheduling grant. Here, the<br>
demultiplexer 902 and the PDCCH decoder 907 constitute a PDCCH reception<br>
unit.<br>
Above, a description has been made of an operation and apparatus for<br>
restricting a monitoring set or a set of PDCCHs that a terminal monitors. A more<br>
detailed description will now be made of specific embodiments for establishing a<br>
monitoring set for a terminal.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
According to a first embodiment, in establishing a monitoring set of<br>
PDCCHs for a terminal, a base station signals to the terminal a number of<br>
PDCCHs that the terminal should monitor, regardless of a code rate of each<br>
PDCCH. The code rate of PDCCH is referred to herein as 'PDCCH MCS', since<br>
it is indicated according to a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) level<br>
indicating a combination of a modulation scheme and a code rate for an Adaptive<br>
Modulation and Coding (AMC) operation. Here, PDCCH MCS corresponds to<br>
the number of CCEs constituting one PDCCH.<br>
A terminal identifies a PDCCH that it should monitor, based on (i) the<br>
number of PDCCHs for each PDCCH MCS determined according to periodic<br>
information, such as CatO or BCH, (ii) the number of PDCCHs that the terminal<br>
should monitor, which is set by upper layer signaling according to the terminal,<br>
and (iii) a random number generation function that uses a terminal ID or<br>
transmission time as its variable. Because a base station may also determine (i)<br>
the number of PDCCHs for each PDCCH MCS determined according to periodic<br>
information, such as CatO or BCH, (ii) the number of PDCCHs that the terminal<br>
should monitor, which is set by upper layer signaling according to the terminal,<br>
and (iii) a terminal ID or transmission time, the base station determines PDCCHs<br>
that the terminal should monitor, and transmits a scheduling grant using one of<br>
the determined PDCCHs.<br>
A subframe indicator may be used as transmission time information used<br>
as a variable of the random number generation function. Because an available<br>
monitoring set is subject to change at every subframe as the transmission time<br>
information is considered, the base station has flexibility in using PDCCHs. That<br>
is, if a PDCCH having a desired PDCCH MCS is not included in a monitoring set<br>
in the current subframe as the monitoring set changes at every subframe. there is a<br>
possibility that the PDCCH having the PDCCH MCS will be included in a<br>
monitoring set in the next subframe.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
According to a second embodiment, in establishing a monitoring set for a<br>
terminal, a base station signals to the terminal a number of PDCCHs that the<br>
terminal monitors according to a code rate of each PDCCH. Therefore, even<br>
though the total number of PDCCHs that the base station can use varies according<br>
to the periodic information, the terminal always monitors the same number of<br>
PDCCHs according to the PDCCH MCS.<br>
The terminal identifies PDCCH that it should monitor for each PDCCH<br>
MCS, based on (i) the number of PDCCHs for each PDCCH MCS determined<br>
according to periodic information, such as CatO or BCH, (ii) the number of<br>
PDCCHs that the terminal should monitor according to PDCCH MCS which is<br>
set by upper layer signaling according to the terminal, and (iii) a random number<br>
generation function that uses a terminal ID or transmission time as its variable.<br>
Because a base station may also determine (i) the number of PDCCHs for each<br>
PDCCH MCS determined according to periodic information, such as CatO or<br>
BCH, (ii) the number of PDCCHs that the terminal should monitor according to<br>
PDCCH MCS which is set by upper layer signaling according to the terminal, and<br>
(iii) a terminal ID or transmission time, the base station transmits a scheduling<br>
grant using one of the PDCCHs that the terminal can receive.<br>
The second embodiment determines PDCCH that it should monitor using<br>
the random number generation function for each terminal in order to enable one<br>
PDCCH to be used with a same probability, if possible, between several terminals<br>
so that several terminals can have flexibility in using the restricted number of<br>
PDCCHs.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
When a random number generation function is used to determine a<br>
PDCCH that the terminal should monitor, several terminals may receive and<br>
decode the same PDCCH. Therefore, in establishing a monitoring set for a<br>
terminal, the third embodiment transmits to the terminal a separate variable based<br>
on PDCCH MCS by upper layer signaling, so the base station directly determines<br>
the PDCCHs that the terminal should monitor for each PDCCH MCS. For<br>
example, the base station signals offset and modular values for each PDCCH<br>
MCS, and sets an i(n)th PDCCH satisfying Equation (I) as a member of a<br>
monitoring set for the terminal.<br>
<br>
In Equation (1), i(n) denotes an index of PDCCH with PDCCH MCS=n.<br>
and its scope is determined according to periodic information, such as CatO or<br>
BCH. Further, Offset(n) and modular(n) are variables used for PDCCH MCS=n.<br>
and are delivered to the terminal through upper layer signaling.<br>
Because the base station can acquire upper layer signaling information for<br>
the terminal, it determines PDCCHs that the terminal can receive, using Equation<br>
(1), and transmits a scheduling grant using one of the PDCCHs.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
A base station signals an offset value along with the number<br>
Num PDCCH of PDCCHs that a terminal should monitor for each PDCCH MCS.<br>
and sets an i(n)th PDCCH satisfying Equation (2) as a member of a monitoring set<br>
for the terminal. In the following, TotalPDCCH (n) denotes the total number of<br>
PDCCHs with PDCCH MCS=n, that the base station can transmit, which is<br>
determined according to periodic information, such as CatO or BCH.<br>
<br>
In Equation (2), i(n) denotes an index of PDCCH with PDCCH MCS=n.<br>
and has a scope ranging from 1 to TotalPDCCH (n). Further, Offset(n) and<br>
NumPDCCH (n) are variables used for PDCCH MCS=n, and are delivered to<br>
the terminal by upper layer signaling.<br>
Because the base station may acquire upper layer signaling information<br>
for the terminal, it determines PDCCHs that the terminal can receive, using<br>
Equation (2), and transmits a scheduling grant using one of the PDCCHs.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br>
In establishing a monitoring set for a terminal, a fifth embodiment restricts<br>
the number of CCEs that the terminal receives, and uses PDCCH(s) including the<br>
restricted number of CCEs as a monitoring set. The number of CCEs that a base<br>
station uses in transmitting PDCCH is determined according to periodic<br>
information, such as CatO or BCH, and regardless of the total number of CCEs.<br>
the base station notifies the number of CCEs that the terminal can receive, to the<br>
terminal through upper layer signaling. The terminal identifies CCEs it can<br>
receive, among all the CCEs determined according to the periodic information<br>
such, as CatO or BCH, using the number of CCEs that the terminal can receive,<br>
which is determined by upper layer signaling. A random number generation<br>
function can be used to determine the CCEs, and in determining CCEs.<br>
consecutive CCEs can be used, the number of which is equal to the number of<br>
CCEs that the terminal can receive.<br>
For example, in FIG. 5B, if the terminal is set such that it can receive 4<br>
CCEs of CCE5 531, CCE6 532, CCE7 533, and CCE8 534, a set of possible<br>
PDCCHs including CCEs 531-534 is established according thereto. That is.<br>
PDCCHs 520, 514, 521, and 522 composed of one CCE, PDCCHs 523 and 524<br>
composed of two CCEs, and PDCCH 516 composed of four CCEs are defined as<br>
a monitoring set of PDCCHs that the terminal monitors.<br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
In establishing a monitoring set for a terminal, a sixth embodiment<br>
establishes the PDCCH having the lowest PDCCH MCS as a monitoring set, i.e..<br>
only the PDCCH composed of the greatest number of CCEs, among the PDCCHs<br>
that the terminal should monitor. Then, regarding CCEs constituting the PDCCH,<br>
the monitoring set for the terminal is determined as PDCCHs indicating another<br>
PDCCH MCS, which include the CCEs. That is, if the base station notifies<br>
PDCCH MCS of a reference PDCCH that the terminal should receive, and the<br>
number of PDCCHs having the PDCCH MCS, by upper layer signaling, the<br>
PDCCHs that the terminal now monitors is determined based thereon according<br>
to a predetermined rule.<br>
For example, if the reference PDCCH is a PDCCH candidate 516<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5B, the terminal receives four CCEs of CCE5 531, CCE6 532,<br>
CCE7 533, and CCE8 534 for the reference PDCCH 516. Therefore, all other<br>
possible PDCCHs including the four CCEs 531~534 are defined as a monitoring<br>
set for the terminal. In FIG. 5B, PDCCHs 520, 514, 521, and 522 including one<br>
CCE and PDCCHs 523 and 524 including two CCEs are included in a PDCCH<br>
set that the terminal must monitor.<br>
The sixth embodiment can restrict even a particular PDCCH MCS. For<br>
example, if a channel condition of a terminal is poor, the sixth embodiment makes<br>
a restriction such that the terminal should not monitor the PDCCHs including one<br>
CCE. Then the terminal monitors only the three PDCCHs 523, 524, and 516.<br>
Seventh Embodiment<br>
In establishing a monitoring set for a terminal, a seventh embodiment sets<br>
a number of CCEs constituting a PDCCH having one PDCCH MCS, i.e.. one<br>
PDCCH, among the PDCCHs that the terminal must monitor, and establishes a<br>
monitoring set based thereon. For example, the seventh embodiment establishes a<br>
monitoring set that has PDCCH including one CCE as a member, for a terminal in<br>
a good channel state, and establishes a monitoring set that has PDCCH including<br>
many CCEs as a member, for a terminal in a poor channel state. Although it is<br>
assumed in the foregoing other embodiments that multiple PDCCH MCSs are set,<br>
the sixth embodiment sets one PDCCH MCS in order to reduce the complexity<br>
required for receiving PDCCH(s) for each of various PDCCH MCSs.<br>
A level of the PDCCH MCS is notified separately for each terminal<br>
through upper layer signaling. The base station sets and notifies PDCCH MCS<br>
that uses the less number of CCEs, for a terminal in a better channel state<br>
according to the average channel state of each terminal, and sets and notifies<br>
PDCCH MCS that uses the greater number of CCEs, for a terminal in a worse<br>
channel state. If the base station establishes, by upper layer signaling, a PDCCH<br>
monitoring set that uses a predefined PDCCH MCS for a terminal in the state<br>
before PDCCH MCS is set, PDSCH information including upper layer signaling<br>
information indicating PDCCH MCS to be used later can be transmitted through<br>
one of the PDCCHs in the monitoring set.<br>
For example, if a terminal is set to receive PDCCH including one CCE<br>
among the PDCCH candidates illustrated in FIG. 5B as its channel state is good.<br>
PDCCH candidates #5 520, #6 514, #7 521, and #8 522 among the PDCCH<br>
candidates #l-#8 including one CCE are included in a PDCCH monitoring set.<br>
More specifically, a function of defining PDCCH that the terminal must<br>
monitor is a random number generation function that has, as its factors, (i) the<br>
number of PDCCHs for each PDCCH MCS determined according to periodic<br>
information, such as CatO or BCH, (ii) the number (i.e., a level of PDCCH MCS)<br>
of CCEs used by PDCCHs that the terminal must monitor, which is set by upper<br>
layer signaling according to the terminal, and (iii) a terminal ID or transmission<br>
time.<br>
The foregoing embodiments have presented rules for defining a<br>
monitoring set or a set of PDCCHs that the terminal should monitor. In defining<br>
the monitoring set of PDCCHs, the embodiments need upper layer signaling, and<br>
the upper layer signaling information is transmitted to the terminal through a<br>
downlink packet. Therefore, the terminal, before it identifies a set of PDCCHs it<br>
should monitor, needs to monitor a PDCCH in order to receive upper layer<br>
signaling information. In this case, the upper layer signaling information is<br>
transmitted to the terminal through one of the following methods.<br>
1) A terminal receives PDCCH information used for identifying a set of<br>
PDCCHs it should monitor, using periodic system information (or BCH<br>
information). In this case, if there is a need for PDCCH to transmit BCH<br>
information, a base station can separately define PDCCH for, for example.<br>
Dedicated (D)-BCH information in transmitting the D-BCH information.<br>
2) A terminal receives PDCCH information used for identifying a set of<br>
PDCCHs it should monitor, using the message information that the base station<br>
provides to the terminal through a Random Access procedure. In the RACH<br>
procedure, if there is a need for PDCCH in transmitting the message information<br>
over the downlink, PDCCH for the message information can be separately<br>
defined or can be determined based on the previously received BCH information.<br>
3) A base station defines a reference set of PDCCHs that a terminal should<br>
always monitor based on a predetermined rule before a set of PDCCHs the<br>
terminal should monitor is determined, and the terminal monitors the PDCCHs<br>
included in the reference set of the terminal.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, in an OFDMA<br>
communication system in which a base station transmits a scheduling grant and a<br>
terminal receives the scheduling grant, the present invention restricts a number of<br>
control channels that the terminal monitors, thereby reducing the reception<br>
complexity of the terminal and avoiding battery consumption. In addition, even<br>
though the total number of control channels varies, the present invention can<br>
maintain the number of control channels that the terminal monitors, to some<br>
extent.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
