60/515,581, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING<br>
HARMONIC NOISE WEIGHTING IN DIGITAL SPEECH CODERS," filed<br>
October 30, 2003, which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to signal compression systems<br>
and, more particularly, to Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP)-type speech<br>
coding systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Compression of digital speech and audio signals is well known.<br>
Compression is generally required to efficiently transmit signals over a<br>
communications channel, or to store compressed signals on a digital media<br>
device, such as a solid-state memory device or computer hard disk. Although<br>
there exist many compression (or "coding") techniques, one method that has<br>
remained very popular for digital speech coding is known as Code Excited<br>
Linear Prediction (CELP), which is one of a family of "analysis-by-synthesis"<br>
coding algorithms. Analysis-by-synthesis generally refers to a coding process<br>
by which parameters of a digital model are used to synthesize a set of candidate<br>
signals that are compared to an input signal and analyzed for distortion. The set<br>
of parameters that yield the lowest distortion, or error component, is then either<br>
transmitted or stored. The set of parameters are eventually used to reconstruct<br>
an estimate of the original input signal. CELP is a particular analysis-by-<br>
synthesis method that uses one or more excitation codebooks that essentially<br>
comprise sets of code-vectors that are retrieved from the codebook in response<br>
to a codebook index. These code-vectors are used as stimuli to the speech<br>
synthesizer in a "trial and error" process in which an error criterion is evaluated<br>
for each of the candidate code-vectors, and the candidates resulting in the<br>
lowest error are selected.<br>
For example, FIG. 1 is a block diagram of prior-art CELP encoder 100.<br>
In CELP encoder 100, an input signal comprising speech sample n (s(n)) is<br>
applied to a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis block 101, where linear<br>
predictive coding is used to estimate a short-term spectral envelope. The<br>
resulting spectral parameters (or LP parameters) are denoted by the transfer<br>
function A(z). The spectral parameters are applied to LPC Quantization block<br>
102 that quantizes the spectral parameters to produce quantized spectral<br>
parameters Aq that are suitable for use in a multiplexer 108. The quantized<br>
spectral parameters Aq are then conveyed to multiplexer 108, and the<br>
multiplexer produces a coded bit stream based on the quantized spectral<br>
parameters and a set of parameters, t, ß, k, and ?, that are determined by a<br>
squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 107. As one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize, t, ß, k, and ? are defined as the closed<br>
loop pitch delay, adaptive codebook gain, fixed codebook vector index, and<br>
fixed codebook gain, respectively.<br>
The quantized spectral, or LP, parameters are also conveyed locally to<br>
LPC synthesis filter 105 that has a corresponding transfer function 1/Aq(z). LPC<br>
synthesis filter 105 also receives combined excitation signal u(n) from first<br>
combiner 110 and produces an estimate of the input signal s(n) based on the<br>
quantized spectral parameters Aq and the combined excitation signal u(n).<br>
Combined excitation signal u(n) is produced as follows. An adaptive codebook<br>
code-vector cr is selected from adaptive codebook (ACB) 103 based on the<br>
index parameter r. The adaptive codebook code-vector Cr is then weighted based<br>
on the gain parameter ß and the weighted adaptive codebook code-vector is<br>
conveyed to first combiner 110. A fixed codebook code-vector ck. is selected<br>
from fixed codebook (FCB) 104 based on the index parameter k. The fixed<br>
codebook code-vector cr is then weighted based on the gain parameter y and is<br>
also conveyed to first combiner 110. First combiner 110 then produces<br>
combined excitation signal u(n) by combining the weighted version of adaptive<br>
codebook code-vector cr with the weighted version of fixed codebook code-<br>
vector ck. (For the convenience of the reader, the variables are also given in<br>
terms of their z-transforms. The z-transform of a variable is represented by a<br>
corresponding capital letter, for example z-transform of e(n) is represented as<br>
E(z)).<br>
LPC synthesis filter 105 conveys the input signal estimate s(n) to<br>
second combiner 112. Second combiner 112 also receives input signal s(n) and<br>
subtracts the estimate of the input signal s(n) from the input signal s(n). The<br>
difference between input signal s(n) and input signal estimate s(n) is applied to<br>
a perceptual error weighting filter 106, which produces a perceptually weighted<br>
error signal e(n) based on the difference between s(n) and s(n) and a weighting<br>
function w(n), such that<br><br>
Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to squared error<br>
minimization/parameter quantization block 107. Squared error<br>
minimization/parameter quantization block 107 uses the error signal e(n) to<br>
determine an optimal set of parameters t, ß, k, and y that produce the best<br>
estimate s(n)of the input signal s(n).<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of prior-art decoder 200 that receives<br>
transmissions from encoder 100. As one of ordinary skilled in the art realizes,<br>
the coded bit stream produced by encoder 100 is used by a de-multiplexer in<br>
decoder 200 to decode the optimal set of parameters, that is, t, ß, k, and y, in a<br>
process that is identical to the synthesis process performed by encoder 100.<br>
Thus, if the coded bit stream produced by encoder 100 is received by decoder<br>
200 without errors, the speech s(n) output by decoder 200 can be reconstructed<br>
as an exact duplicate of the input speech estimate s(n) produced by encoder<br>
100.<br>
Returning to FIG. 1, weighting filter W(z) utilizes the frequency<br>
masking property of the human ear, such that simultaneously occurring noise is<br>
masked by the stronger signal provided the frequencies of the signal and the<br>
noise are close. As described in Salami R., Laflamme C, Adoul J-P, Massaloux<br>
D., "A toll quality 8 Kb/s speech coder for personal communications system,"<br>
IEEE Trans. On Vehicular Technology, pp. 808-816, Aug 1994 W{z) is derived<br>
from the LPC coefficients ai, and is given by<br><br>
and p is the order of the LPC. Since the weighting filter is derived from LPC<br>
spectrum, it is also referred to as "spectral weighting".<br>
The above-described procedure does not take into account the fact that<br>
the signal periodicity also contributes to the spectral peaks at the fundamental<br>
frequencies and at the multiples of the fundamental frequencies. Various<br>
techniques have been proposed to utilize noise masking of these fundamental<br>
frequency harmonics. For example, in "Digital speech coder and method<br>
utilizing harmonic noise weighting" Patent No. 5,528,723: Gerson and Jasiuk,<br>
and in Gerson I. A., Jasiuk M.A., "Techniques for improving the performance<br>
of CELP type speech coders," Proc. IEEE ICASSP, pp. 205-208, 1993, a<br>
method was proposed which includes harmonic noise masking in the weighting<br>
filter. As the above-references show, harmonic noise weighting is incorporated<br>
by modifying the spectral weighting filter by a harmonic noise weighting filter<br>
C(z) and is given by:<br><br>
where D corresponds to the pitch period or the pitch lag or delay, b, are the filter<br>
coefficients and 0 = ep 
weighting filter incorporating harmonic noise weighting is given by:<br><br>
The amount of harmonic noise weighting is typically dependent on the<br>
product epbi. Since bi is dependent on the delay, the amount of harmonic noise<br>
weighting is a function of the delay. Prior-art references noted above have<br>
suggested that different values of harmonic noise weighting coefficient (ep) can<br>
be used at different predetermined times: i.e., ep may be a time varying<br>
parameter (for example be allowed to change from sub-frame to sub-frame),<br>
however, the prior art does not provide a method for choosing ep. Therefore, a<br>
need exists for a method and apparatus for performing harmonic noise<br>
weighting in digital speech coders that optimally and dynamically determines<br>
appropriate values of ep so that the amount of harmonic noise weighting can be<br>
optimized. While prior-art references noted above have suggested that different<br>
values of the harmonic noise weighting coefficient (ep) can be used at different<br>
times (e.g., ep may vary from sub-frame to sub-frame), the prior art does not<br>
provide a method for varying ep or suggest when or how such a method may be<br>
beneficial. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for performing<br>
harmonic noise weighting in digital speech coders that optimally and<br>
dynamically determines appropriate values of ep so that the overall perceptual<br>
weighting can be improved.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for choosing values of harmonic noise weighting<br>
(HNW) coefficient (ep) so that the amount of harmonic noise weighting can be<br>
optimized, a method and apparatus for performing harmonic noise weighting in<br>
digital speech coders is provided herein. During operation, received speech is<br>
analyzed to determine a pitch period. HNW coefficients are then chosen based<br>
on the pitch period, and a perceptual noise weighting filter (C(z)) is determined<br>
based on the harmonic-noise weighting (HNW) coefficients (ep). For large pitch<br>
periods (D), the peaks of the fundamental frequency harmonics are very close<br>
and hence the valleys between the adjacent harmonics may lie in the masking<br>
region of the adjoining peaks. Thus, there may be no need to have a strong<br>
harmonic noise weighting coefficient for larger values of D.<br>
Because HNW coefficients are a function of pitch period, a better noise<br>
weighting can be performed and hence the speech distortions are less noticeable<br>
to the listeners.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for performing harmonic<br>
noise weighting in a digital speech coder. The method comprises the steps of<br>
receiving a speech input s(n) determining a pitch period (D) from the speech<br>
input, and determining a harmonic noise weighting coefficient ep based on the<br>
pitch period. A perceptual noise weighting function WH (z) is then determined<br>
based on the harmonic noise weighting coefficient.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method for<br>
performing harmonic noise weighting in a digital speech coder. The method<br>
comprises the steps of receiving a speech input.s(n), determining a closed-loop<br>
pitch delay (r) from the speech input, and determining a harmonic noise<br>
weighting coefficient ep based on the closed-loop pitch delay. A perceptual<br>
noise weighting function Wn(z) is then determined based on the harmonic noise<br>
weighting coefficient<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus<br>
comprising pitch analysis circuitry having speech (s(n)) as an input and<br>
outputting a pitch period (D) based on the speech, a harmonic noise coefficient<br>
generator having D as an input and outputting a harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient ( ep ) based on D, and a perceptual error weighting filter having ep<br>
as an input and utilizing ep to generate a weighted error signal e(n), wherein<br>
e(n) is based on a difference between s(n) and an estimate of s(n).<br>
The present invention finally encompasses an apparatus comprising a<br>
harmonic noise coefficient generator having a closed-loop pitch delay (t) as an<br>
input and outputting a harmonic noise weighting coefficient (ep ) based on t, a<br>
perceptual error weighting filter having ep as an input and utilizing ep to<br>
generate a weighted error signal e(n), wherein e(n) is based on a difference<br>
between.s(n) and an estimate of s(n).<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, FIG. 3 is a block diagram of CELP coder 300 in accordance with<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown, CELP decoder<br>
300 is similar to those shown in the prior art, except for the addition of pitch<br>
analysis circuitry 311 and HNW coefficient generator 309. Additionally<br>
Perceptual Error weighting Filter 306 is adapted to receive HNW coefficients<br>
from HNW Coefficient generator 309. Operation of coder 300 occurs as<br>
follows:<br>
Input speech s(n) is directed towards pitch analysis circuitry 311, where<br>
s(n) is analyzed to determine a pitch period (D). As one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will recognize, pitch period (additionally referred to as pitch lag, delay, or<br>
pitch delay) is typically the time lag at which the past input speech has the<br>
maximum correlation with current input speech.<br>
Once the pitch period (D) is determined, D is directed towards HNW<br>
coefficient generator 309 where a HNW coefficient (ep) for the particular<br>
speech is determined. As discussed above, the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient is allowed to dynamically vary as a function of the pitch period D<br>
The harmonic noise-weighting filter is given by:<br><br>
As mentioned above, it is desirable to have less harmonic noise<br>
weighting (C(z)) for larger value of D. Choosing eP as a decreasing function of<br>
D (see Eq. 7) ensures a lower amount of harmonic noise weighting for larger<br>
values of pitch delay. Although many functions of ep(D) exist, in the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention ep(D) is given by equation (7) and shown<br>
graphically in FIG. 4.<br><br>
where,<br>
emax is the maximum allowable value of the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient;<br>
emin is the minimum allowable value of the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient;<br>
Dmax is the maximum pitch period above which the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient is set to emin;<br>
A is the slope for the harmonic noise weighting coefficient.<br>
Once ep (D) is determined by generator 309, ep(D) is supplied to filter<br>
306 to generate the weighting filter WH(z). As described above, WH(z) is the<br>
product of W(z) and C(z). The error s(n) ~ s(n) is supplied to weighting filter<br>
306 to generate the weighted error signal e(n). As in prior-art encoders, error<br>
weighting filter 306 produces the weighted error signal e(n) based on a<br>
difference between the input signal and the estimated input signal, that is:<br><br>
Weighting filter WH (z) utilizes the frequency masking property of the<br>
human ear, such that simultaneously occurring noise is masked by the stronger<br>
signal provided the frequencies of the signal and the noise are close. Based on<br>
the value of e(n), squared Error Minimization/Parameter Quantization circuitry<br>
307 produces values of t, k, ?, ß which are transmitted on the channel, or stored<br>
on a digital media device.<br>
As discussed above, because HNW coefficients are a function of pitch<br>
period, a better noise weighting can be performed and hence the speech<br>
distortions are less noticeable to the listener.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing operation of encoder 300. The logic flow<br>
begins at step 501 where a speech input (s(n)) is received by pitch analysis<br>
circuitry 311. At step 503, pitch analysis circuitry 311 determines a pitch period<br>
(D) and outputs D to HNW coefficient generator 309. HNW coefficient<br>
generator 309 utilizes D to determine a harmonic noise weighting coefficient<br>
(ep) based on D and outputs ep to perceptual error weighting filter 306 (step<br>
505). Finally, at step 507 filter 306 utilizes ep to produce a perceptual noise<br>
weighting function WH(z).<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although a<br>
specific formula was given for the production of WH (z) from ep, it is intended<br>
that other means for producing WH (z) from eP may be utilized. For example,<br>
the summation term in the definition of C(z) in equation (6) can be further<br>
modified before multiplying with ep. Additionally, in an alternate embodiment<br>
ep can be based on t with r (see FIG. 6) replacing D in equation (7). As<br>
discussed above t is defined as the closed loop pitch delay, with ep being a<br>
decreasing function of t. Thus, equation (7) becomes:<br><br>
where,<br>
emax is the maximum allowable value of the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient;<br>
emin is the minimum allowable value of the harmonic noise weighting<br>
coefficient;<br>
tmax is the maximum closed-loop pitch delay above which harmonic noise<br>
weighting coefficient is set to emin;<br>
A is the slope for the harmonic noise weighting coefficient.<br>
