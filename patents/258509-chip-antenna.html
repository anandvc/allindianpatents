				<td>Chip antenna<br>
The invention relates to an antenna in which the radiators are conductor coatings of a dielectric chip. The chip is intended to be mounted on a circuit board of a radio device, which circuit board is a part of the whole antenna structure.<br>
In small-sized radio devices, such as mobile phones, the antenna or antennas are preferably placed inside the cover of the device, and naturally the intention is to make them as small as possible. An internal antenna has usually a planar structure so that it includes a radiating plane and a ground plane below it. There is also a variation of the monopole antenna, in which the ground plane is not below the radiating plane but farther on the side. In both cases, the size of the antenna can be reduced by manufacturing the radiating plane on the surface of a dielectric chip instead of making it air insulated. The higher the dielectricity of the material, the smaller the physical size of an antenna element of a certain electric size. The antenna component becomes a chip to be mounted on a circuit board. However, such a reduction of the size of the antenna entails the increase of losses and thus a deterioration of efficiency.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a chip antenna known from the publications EP 1 162 688 and US 6 323 811, in which antenna there are two radiating elements side by side on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 110. The first element 120 is connected by the feed conductor 141 to the feeding source, and the second element 130, which is a parasitic element, by a ground conductor 143 to the ground. The resonance frequencies of the elements can be arranged to be different in order to widen the band. The feed conductor and the ground conductor are on a lateral surface of the dielectric substrate. On the same lateral surface, there is a matching conductor 142 branching from the feed conductor 141, which matching conductor is connected to the ground at one end. The matching conductor extends so close to the ground conductor 143 of the parasitic element that there is a significant coupling between them. The parasitic element 130 is electromagnetically fed through this coupling. The feed conductor, the matching conductor and the ground conductor of the parasitic element together form a feed circuit; the optimum matching and gain for the antenna can then be found by shaping the strip conductors of the feed circuit. Between the radiating elements, there is a slot 150 running diagonally across the upper surface of the substrate, and at the open ends of the elements, i.e. at the opposite ends as viewed from the feeding side, there are extensions reaching to the lateral surface of the substrate. By means of such design, as<br><br>
well by the structure of the feed circuit, it is aimed to arrange the currents of the elements orthogonally so that the resonances of the elements would not weaken each other.<br>
A drawback of the above described antenna structure is that in spite of the optimization of the feed circuit, waveforms that increase the losses and are useless with regard to the radiation are created in the dielectric substrate. The efficiency of the antenna is thus not satisfactory. In addition, the antenna leaves room for improvement if a relatively even radiation pattern, or omnidirectional radiation, is required.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to reduce the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art. A chip antenna according to the invention is characterized in what is set forth in the independent claim 1. Some preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth in the other claims.<br>
The basic idea of the invention is the following: The antenna comprises two radiating elements on the surface of a dielectric substrate chip. They are of the same size and symmetrical so that each of them covers one of the opposite heads and part of the upper surface of the rectangular chip. In the middle of the upper surface between the elements there remains slot, over which the elements have an electromagnetic coupling with each other. The circuit board, on which the chip component is mounted, has no ground plane under the chip or on its sides up to a certain distance. The lower edge of one of the radiating elements is galvanically connected to the antenna feed conductor on the circuit board, and at another point to the ground plane, while the lower edge of the opposite radiating element, or the parasitic element, is galvanically connected only to the ground plane. The parasitic element gets its feed through said electromagnetic coupling, and both elements resonate equally strongly at the operating frequency.<br>
The invention has the advantage that the efficiency of an antenna according to it is good in spite of the dielectric substrate. This is due to the simple structure of the antenna, which produces a uncomplicated current distribution in the radiating element and correspondingly a simple field image in the substrate without "superfluous" waveforms. In addition, the invention has the advantage that the omnidirectional radiation of the antenna according to it is excellent, which is due to its symmetrical structure, shaping of the ground plane and the nature of the coupling between the elements. A further advantage of the invention is that both the tuning and the matching of an antenna according to it can be carried out without discrete<br><br>
components by changing the width of the slot between the radiating elements and by shaping, in a simple way, the conductor pattern of the circuit board near the chip component. Yet another advantage of the invention is that the antenna according to it is very small and simple and tolerates relatively high field strengths.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in more detail. Reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>

:ig. 10     shows an example of the efficiency of an antenna according to the invention.<br>
:ig. 1 was already explained in connection with the description of the prior art.<br>
:ig. 2 shows an example of a chip antenna according to the invention. The an-enna 200 comprises a dielectric substrate chip and two radiating elements on its ;urface, one of which has been connected to the feed conductor of the antenna md the other is an electromagnetically fed parasitic element, like in the known mtenna of Fig. 1. However, there are several structural and functional differences letween those antennas. In the antenna according to the invention, among other lings, the slot separating the radiating elements is between the open ends of the<br><br>
elements and not between the lateral edges, and the parasitic element gets its feed through the coupling prevailing over the slot and not through the coupling between the ground conductor of the parasitic element and the feed conductor. The first radiating element 220 of the antenna 200 comprises a portion 221 partly covering the upper surface of an elongated, rectangular substrate 210 and a head portion 222 covering one head of the substrate. The second radiating element comprises symmetrically a portion 231 covering the upper surface of the substrate partly and a head portion 232 covering the opposite head. Each head portion 222 and 232 continues slightly on the side of the lower surface of the substrate, thus forming the contact surface of the element for its connection. In the middle of the upper surface between the elements there remains a slot 260, over which the elements have an electromagnetic coupling with each other. The slot 260 extends in this example in the transverse direction of the substrate perpendicularly from one lateral surface of the substrate to the other.<br>
The chip component 201, or the substrate with its radiators, is in Fig. 2 on the circuit board PCB on its edge and its lower surface against the circuit board. The antenna feed conductor 240 is a strip conductor on the upper surface of the circuit board, and together with the ground plane, or the signal ground GND, and the circuit board material it forms a feed line having a certain impedance. The feed conductor 240 is galvanically coupled to the first radiating element 220 at a certain point of its contact surface. At another point of the contact surface, the first radiating element is galvanically coupled to the ground plane GND. At the opposite end of the substrate, the second radiating element 230 is galvanically coupled at its contact surface to the ground conductor 250, which is an extension of the wider ground plane GND. The width and length of the ground conductor 250 have an direct effect on the electric length of the second element and thereby on the natural frequency of the whole antenna. For this reason, the ground conductor can be used as a tuning element for the antenna.<br>
The tuning of the antenna is also influenced by the shaping of the other parts of the ground plane, too, and the width d of the slot 260 between the radiating elements. There is no ground plane under the chip component 201, and on the side of the chip component the ground plane is at a certain distance s from it. The longer the distance, the lower the natural frequency. In turn, increasing the width d of the slot increases the natural frequency of the antenna. The distance s also has an effect on its impedance. Therefore the antenna can be matched by finding the optimum distance of the ground plane from the long side of the chip component. In<br><br>
addition, removing the ground plane from the side of the chip component improves the radiation characteristics of the antenna, such as its omnidirectional radiation.<br>
At the operating frequency, both radiating elements together with the substrate, each other and the ground plane form a quarter-wave resonator. Due to the above described structure, the open ends of the resonators are facing each other, separated by the slot 260, and said electromagnetic coupling is clearly capacitive. The width d of the slot is dimensioned so that the resonances of both radiators are strong and that the dielectric losses of the substrate are minimized. The optimum width is, for example, 1.2 mm and a suitable range of variation 0.8-2.0 mm, for example. When a ceramic substrate is used, the structure provides a very small size. The dimensions of a chip component of a Bluetooth antenna operating on the frequency range 2.4 GHz are 2x2x7 mm3, for example, and those of a chip component of a GPS (Global Positioning System) antenna operating at the frequency of 1575 MHz 2x3x10 mm3, for example.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a part of the circuit board belonging to the antenna structure of Fig. 2 as seen from below. The chip component 201 on the other side of the circuit board PCB has been marked with dashed lines in the drawing. Similarly with dashed lines are marked the feed conductor 240, the ground conductor 250 and a ground strip 251 extending under the chip component to its contact surface at the end on the side of the feed conductor. A large part of the lower surface of the circuit board belongs to the ground plane GND. The ground plane is missing from a corner of the board in the area A, which comprises the place of the chip component and an area extending to a certain distance s from the chip component, having a width which is the same as the length of the chip component.<br>
Fig. 4a shows another example of the chip component of an antenna according to the invention. The component 401 is mainly similar to the component 201 presented in Fig. 2. The difference is that now the radiating elements extend to the lateral surfaces of the substrate 410 at the ends of the component, and the heads of the substrate are largely uncoated. Thus the first radiating element 420 comprises a portion 421 partly covering the upper surface of the substrate, a portion 422 in a corner of the substrate and a portion 423 in another corner of the same end. The portions 422 and 423 in the corners are partly on the side of the lateral surface of the substrate and partly on the side of the head surface. They continue slightly to the lower surface of the substrate, forming thus the contact surface of the element for its connection. The second radiating element 430 is similar to the first one and is located symmetrically with respect to it. The portions of the radiat-<br><br>
ing elements being located in the corners can naturally also be limited only to the lateral surfaces of the substrate or only to one of the lateral surfaces. In the latter case, the conductor coating running along the lateral surface continues at either end of the component under it for the whole length of the end.<br>
In Fig. 4b, the chip component 401 of Fig. 4a is seen from below. The lower surface of the substrate 410 and the conductor pads serving as said contact surfaces in its corners are seen in the figure. One of the conductor pads at the first end of the substrate is intended to be connected to the antenna feed conductor and the other one to the ground plane GND. Both of the conductor pads at the second end of the substrate are intended to be connected to the ground plane.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a chip component according to Figs. 4a and 4b as mounted on the circuit board so that a whole antenna 400 is formed. Only a small part of the circuit board is visible. Now the chip component 401 is not located at the edge of the circuit board, and therefore there is a groundless area on its both sides up to a certain distance s. The antenna feed conductor 440 is connected to the chip component in one corner of its lower surface, and the ground plane extends to other corners corresponding Fig, 4b.<br>
Figs. 6a-d show examples of shaping of the slot between the radiating elements in an antenna according to the invention. In Fig. 6a the antenna's chip component 601 is seen from above and in Fig. 6b the chip component 602 is seen from above. Both the slot 661 in component 601 and the slot 662 in component 602 travel diagonally across the upper surface of the component from the first to the second side of the component. The slot 662 is yet more diagonal and thus longer than the slot 661, extending from a corner to the opposite, farthest corner of the upper surface of the chip component. In addition, the slot 662 is narrower than the slot 661. It is mentioned before that broadening the slot increases the natural frequency of the antenna. Vice versa, narrowing the slot decreases the natural frequency of the antenna, or shifts the antenna operation band downwards. Lengthening the slot by making it diagonal affects in the same way, even more effectively.<br>
In Fig. 6c the antenna's chip component 603 is seen from above and in Fig. 6d the ship component 604 is seen from above. Both the slot 663 in component 603 and !he slot 664 in component 604 now have turns. The slot 663 has six rectangular :urns so that a finger-like strip 625 is formed in the first radiating element, the strip 3Xtending between the regions, which belong to the second radiating element.<br><br>
Symmetrically, a finger-like strip 635 is formed in the second radiating element, this strip extending between the regions, which belong to the first radiating element. The number of the turns in the slot 664 belonging to the component 604 is greater so that two finger-like strips 626 and 627 are formed in the first radiating element, these strips extending between the regions, which belong to the second radiating element. Between these strips there is a finger-like strip 636 as a projection of the second radiating element. The strips in the component 604 are, besides more numerous, also longer than the strips in the component 603, and in addition the slot 664 is narrower than the slot 663. For these reasons the operation band of an antenna corresponding to the component 604 is located clearly lower down than the operation band of an antenna corresponding to the component 603.<br>
Fig. 7 presents an example of the directional characteristics of an antenna according to the invention, being located in a mobile phone, The antenna has been dimensioned for the Bluetooth system. There are three directional patterns in the figure. The directional pattern 71 presents the antenna gain on plane XZ, the directional pattern 72 on plane YZ and the directional pattern 73 on plane XY, when the X axis is the longitudinal direction of the chip component, the Y axis is the vertical direction of the chip component and the Z axis is the transverse direction of the chip component. It is seen from the patterns that the antenna transmits and receives well on all planes and in all directions. On the plane XY in particular, the pattern is even. The two others only have a recess of 10 dB in a sector about 45 degrees wide. The totally "dark" sectors typical in directional patterns do not exist at all.<br>
Fig. 8 presents an example of the band characteristics of an antenna according to the invention. It presents a curve of the reflection coefficient S11 as a function of frequency. The curve has been measured from the same Bluetooth antenna as the patterns of Fig. 6. If the criterion for the cut-off frequency is used the value -6 dB of the reflection coefficient, the bandwidth becomes about 50 MHz, which is about 2% as a relative value. In the centre of the operating band, at the frequency of 2440 MHz, the reflection coefficient is -17 dB, which indicates good matching. The Smith diagram shows that in the centre of the band the impedance of the antenna is purely resistive, below the centre frequency slightly inductive and above the centre frequency slightly capacitive, correspondingly.<br>
Fig. 9 presents an example of an effect of the shape of the slot between the radiating elements on the place of the antenna operation band. The curve 91 shows the fluctuation of the reflection coefficient S11 as a function of frequency in the<br><br>
antenna, the size of the chip component of which is 10x3x4 mm3, and the slot between the radiating elements is perpendicular. The resonance frequency of the antenna, which is approximately the same as the medium frequency of the operation band, falls on the point 1725 MHz. The curve 92 shows the fluctuation of the reflection coefficient, when the slot between the radiating elements is diagonal according to Fig. 6b. In other respects the antenna is similar as in the previous case. Now the resonance frequency of the antenna falls on the point 1575 MHz, the operation band thus being located 150 MHz lower than in the previous case. The frequency 1575 MHz is used by the GPS (Global Positioning System). Not much lower a frequency than that can in practice be reached in the antenna in question by using a diagonal slot. The curve 93 shows the fluctuation of the reflection coefficient, when the slot between the radiating elements has turns according to Fig. 6d and is somewhat narrower than in the two previous cases. In other respects the antenna is similar. Now the operation band of the antenna is down nearly by a half compared to the case corresponding to the curve 91. The resonance frequency falls on the point 880 MHz, which is located in the range used by the EGSM system (Extended GSM).<br>
A ceramics having the value 20 of the relative dielectric coefficient £r is used for the antenna in the three cases of Fig. 9. Using a ceramics with a higher £r value, also the band of an antenna equipped with a diagonal slot can be placed for example in the range of 900 MHz without making the antenna bigger. However, the electric characteristics of the antenna would then be poorer.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an example of the efficiency of an antenna according to the invention. The efficiency has been measured from the same Bluetooth antenna as the patterns of Figs. 7 and 8. At the centre of the operating band of the antenna the efficiency is about 0.44, and decreases from that to the value of about 0.3 when moving 25 MHz to the side from the centre of the band. The efficiency is considerably high for an antenna using a dielectric substrate.<br>
In this description and the claims, a "chip antenna" means an antenna structure, which in addition to the actual chip component itself comprises the ground arrangement surrounding it and the antenna feed arrangement. The qualifiers "upper" and "lower" in this description and the claims refer to the position of the antenna shown in Figs. 2 and 4a, and they have nothing to do with the position in which the devices are used.<br>
