				<td>Description<br>
Method for producing a fault signal which indicates a<br>
short to ground<br>
Protective devices which operate, inter alia, on the<br>
distance protection principle are used for monitoring<br>
polyphase power transmission lines for faults that<br>
occur, in particular shorts. In this case, the<br>
impedance of loops which are created by the short is<br>
determined, and this impedance is used to deduce the<br>
distance between the fault location and the measurement<br>
point. When analyzing loops such as these, a<br>
distinction must essentially be drawn between two loop<br>
types, a conductor to ground loop and a conductor to<br>
conductor loop. In the case of a conductor to ground<br>
loop, the short produces a connection between at least<br>
one of the phase conductors and ground, while in the<br>
case of a conductor to conductor loop, at least two<br>
conductors are shorted to one another without any<br>
contact with ground. Different methods are used to<br>
determine the relevant line section in the two<br>
situations. Thus, before the calculation, it is<br>
necessary to determine whether the short does or does<br>
not involve ground (short to ground).<br>
It is known, for example, from the manual for the<br>
Siemens 7SA522 protective device, Order Number C53000-<br>
G1100-C155-2, pages 6-28 to 6-30, for earth fault<br>
identification to be carried out on the basis of sum<br>
current and residual voltage measurements for this<br>
purpose. In the known method, a fault signal which<br>
identifies a short to ground is produced when the sum<br>
current or the residual voltage is greater than a<br>
respectively predetermined threshold value (OR linking)<br>
This makes use of the effect that both a measurable sum<br>
current and a significant residual voltage normally<br>
occur only in the case of shorts to ground, but not in<br>
the case of shorts that do not involve any ground<br>
contact.<br>
The invention relates to a method such as this and thus<br>
relates in particular to a method for producing a fault <br>
signal which indicates a short to ground on a polyphase<br>
power transmission line, in the case of which, once a<br>
short has occurred on the power transmission line, the<br>
phase currents in the power transmission line are<br>
detected by means of current transformers in order to<br>
form a sum current measured value, and a first short to<br>
ground suspicion signal is produced when the sum<br>
current measured value is greater than a predetermined<br>
current threshold value, the phase voltages on the<br>
power transmission line are detected in order to form a<br>
residual voltage measured value, and a second short to<br>
ground suspicion signal is produced when the residual<br>
voltage measured value is greater than a predetermined<br>
voltage threshold value, and a fault signal which<br>
indicates a short to ground is produced when at least<br>
one short to ground suspicion signal is present.<br>
However, if at least one current transformer which is<br>
involved in the process of determining the sum current<br>
enters saturation, then the measured values are no<br>
longer detected correctly and it is possible to<br>
determine a sum current which spuriously indicates a<br>
discrepancy from zero. Using the threshold value method<br>
described above, a short to ground would then be<br>
identified, and the instruments for determining the<br>
relevant line section in the event of a short to ground<br>
would be (undesirably) enabled. This could lead to<br>
spurious tripping of a circuit breaker connected to the<br>
protective device.<br>
In order to prevent this, so-called stabilized ground<br>
current detection and zero current/negative phase<br>
sequence system current comparison are carried out in<br>
the known device. Since the probability of the<br>
occurrence of current transformer saturation increases<br>
as the phase currents rise, the threshold value for<br>
identification of a short to ground likewise rises as<br>
the phase currents increase for stabilized ground<br>
current detection. However, in order to ensure<br>
sufficient sensitivity, the gradient of the response<br>
characteristic must be kept relatively low. In addition<br>
to the sum current, the negative phase sequence current<br>
on the power transmission line is determined for the<br>
zero current/negative phase sequence system current<br>
comparison, and a value pair is formed from these two<br>
currents. A short to ground is or is not identified<br>
depending on the locus of the value pair in a sum<br>
current/negative phase sequence current diagram.<br>
A further known option for improving the identification<br>
of short to ground is to connect the outputs of the<br>
threshold value stages for the sum current and for the<br>
residual voltage to an AND gate (instead of to an OR<br>
gate as described above) so that a short to ground is<br>
identified only when both the sum current and the<br>
residual voltage are greater than the predetermined<br>
threshold values. However, this AND linking reduces the<br>
sensitivity of the overall method, since the residual<br>
voltage will not invariably rise above the<br>
predetermined threshold value in every situation in<br>
which a short to ground occurs.<br>
The invention is based on the object of further<br>
developing a method of the type mentioned initially<br>
such that spurious tripping resulting from transformer<br>
saturation is particularly effectively prevented.<br>
According to the invention and against the background<br>
of the known method, this object is achieved in that<br>
the current transformers are checked for transformer<br>
saturation, and if transformer saturation is present in<br>
at least one current transformer, a fault signal F<br>
which indicates a short to ground is produced when at<br>
least the second short to ground suspicion signal is<br>
present. In this case, current transformer saturation<br>
may be identified, for example, as described in German<br>
Patent Specification DE 196 33 856 C1. The main<br>
advantage of the method according to the invention is<br>
that spurious tripping of circuit breakers resulting<br>
from a sum current measured value being corrupted by-<br>
transformer saturation is effectively prevented. This<br>
is because a fault signal which identifies a short to<br>
ground is produced only when the residual voltage is<br>
greater than the predetermined voltage threshold value.<br>
One advantageous development of the method according to<br>
the invention provides for the current threshold value<br>
to be set as a function of the maximum phase current in<br>
the power transmission line. This actually makes it<br>
possible to automatically match the threshold value to<br>
the phase current in the situation where no transformer<br>
saturation is present.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
provides for a negative phase sequence system current<br>
measured value also to be formed from the phase<br>
currents and for a further short to ground suspicion<br>
signal to be produced when a value pair which is formed<br>
from the sum current measured value and the negative<br>
phase sequence system current measured value is within<br>
a predetermined tripping range. This allows the<br>
sensitivity of the method according to the invention to<br>
be improved further, particularly for the situation<br>
without transformer saturation.<br>
The invention also relates to an arrangement for<br>
producing a fault signal which indicates a short to<br>
ground on a polyphase power transmission line, which<br>
arrangement has at least one current transformer for<br>
detecting the sum current in the phase conductors of<br>
the power transmission line, a current threshold value<br>
stage which is connected on the input side to the at<br>
least one current transformer, at least one current<br>
transformer for detecting the residual voltage of the<br>
phase conductors of the power transmission line, a<br>
voltage threshold value stage which is connected on the<br>
input side to the at least one voltage transformer, and<br>
an evaluation device which produces a fault signal<br>
which indipates a short to ground, when the sum current<br>
is greater than the current threshold value or the<br>
residual voltage is greater than, the voltage threshold<br>
value.<br>
An arrangement such as this is likewise known from the<br>
initially cited manual for the Siemens 7SA522<br>
protective device.<br>
In order to prevent spurious tripping as a result of<br>
current transformer saturation even more reliably in an<br>
arrangement such as this, provision is made in an<br>
arrangement of said type according to the invention for<br>
a saturation identification device also to be connected<br>
to the current transformers, which emits a saturation<br>
signal when current transformer saturation is present,<br>
and the evaluation device is connected to one output of<br>
the saturation identification device and, when a<br>
saturation signal is present, emits the fault signal<br>
(which indicates a short to ground) on the output side<br>
only when the residual voltage is greater than the<br>
voltage threshold value.<br>
This advantageously prevents any decision being made on<br>
the basis of current detection that is subject to<br>
interference from transformer saturation.<br>
The saturation identification device, which, for<br>
example can be designed as described in German Patent<br>
DE 196 33 856 C1, in this case produces a signal whose<br>
occurrence allows a short to ground to be identified<br>
only when the residual voltage is greater than the<br>
predetermined threshold value.<br>
In order to explain the invention further,<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of an<br>
arrangement for carrying out the method<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic block diagram of an<br>
arrangement for carrying out an advantageous<br>
development of the method according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagram to explain the setting of the<br>
current threshold value, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a diagram to explain the sum<br>
current/negative phase sequence system<br>
current comparison.<br>
Figure 1 shows an arrangement 1 for producing a fault<br>
signal F which indicates a short to ground. A sum<br>
current detection device 3 is connected to a power<br>
transmission line (which is not shown in the figure)<br>
via current transformers 2a, 2b, 2c and a residual<br>
voltage detection device 5 is connected to the power<br>
transmission line via voltage transformers 4a, 4b, 4c.<br>
The number of current transformers 2a, 2b, 2c and of<br>
voltage transformers 4a, 4b, 4c in this case<br>
corresponds to the number of phase conductors in the<br>
power transmission line. Within the scope of the<br>
invention, it is also possible to provide in each case<br>
one transformer for the direct detection of the sum<br>
current or residual voltage instead of the number of<br>
current and voltage transformers, for example, a wrap-<br>
around transformer for sum current detection. However,<br>
an arrangement with a number of current and voltage<br>
transformers as shown in Figure 1 will be considered in<br>
the following text.<br>
The current and voltage vectors which are respectively<br>
detected by the current transformers and voltage<br>
transformers are added in the sum current detection<br>
device 3 and in the residual voltage detection device<br>
5, respectively, for a three-phase power transmission<br>
line using the following equations 1 and 2 in order to<br>
form the subcurrent 3I0 (equation 1) and the residual<br>
voltage 3Uo (equation 2), respectively:<br><br>
In this case, the indices L1, L2, and L3 represent the<br>
respective phase conductors. The sum current 3Io and<br>
the residual voltage 3U0 are then passed to different<br>
inputs of an evaluation device 6. A saturation<br>
identification device 7 is also connected to the<br>
current transformers 2a, 2b, 2c for the current<br>
detection device 3. This connection is represented by a<br>
dashed line in Figure 1; in fact, each current<br>
transformer is connected to its own saturation<br>
identification device or to a saturation identification<br>
device which is shared by all the current transformers,<br>
in each case via a separate electrical connection. The<br>
saturation identification device 7 is in turn linked on<br>
the output side to a control input 8 of the evaluation<br>
device 6. In order to identify a short to ground on the<br>
power transmission line (which is not shown in<br>
Figure 1) , the sum current 3I0 and the residual voltage<br>
3U0 are in each case formed, using the given equations<br>
1 and 2, from the individual phase currents and<br>
voltages respectively, by means of the sum current<br>
detection device 3 and the residual voltage detection<br>
device 5. During normal operation without transformer<br>
saturation, these two variables normally assume values<br>
close to zero. If a short now occurs on the power<br>
transmission line, the algorithm for identification of<br>
a short to ground is started. To do this, the<br>
determined sum current 3I0 is compared with the current<br>
threshold value, and the determined residual voltage,<br>
3Uo is compared with a corresponding voltage threshold<br>
value in the evaluation device 6. If the sum current is<br>
greater than the current threshold value, then an<br>
internal short to ground suspicion signal is produced;<br>
analogously, a second short to ground suspicion signal<br>
is produced when the residual voltage is greater than<br>
the voltage threshold value. If at least one of the two<br>
short to ground suspicion signals is present, then a<br>
short to ground is identified (in the situation where<br>
no transformer saturation is present), and an<br>
appropriate fault signal F is produced at the output of<br>
the evaluation device 6.<br>
However, after the occurrence of a short on the power<br>
transmission line, if the saturation identification<br>
device 7 identifies that at least one of the current<br>
transformers 2a, 2b, 2c is saturated, then a saturation<br>
signal S is produced at its output and is passed to the<br>
control input 8 of the evaluation device 6. The<br>
evaluation device 6 is itself set such that, when a<br>
saturation signal S is present at the control input 8,<br>
the fault signal F which indicates a short to ground is<br>
produced only when the residual voltage 3Uo is greater<br>
than the voltage threshold value. The sum current value<br>
3I0 which is unreliable due to transformer saturation<br>
is in this case no longer included as a decision<br>
criterion in the short to ground identification<br>
process. In a situation where transformer saturation is<br>
present, the fault signal F which indicates a short to<br>
ground is produced only when a short to ground on the<br>
power transmission line is present on the basis of the<br>
residual voltage criterion.<br>
The fault signal F which indicates a short to ground is<br>
normally used by a protective device (not shown in<br>
Figure 1) to activate appropriate instruments for<br>
determining the relevant line section. A spuriously<br>
produced fault signal F can thus lead to undesirable<br>
activation of the instruments and possibly to<br>
undesirable tripping of a circuit breaker that is<br>
connected to the protective device. In the event of<br>
undesirable tripping of a circuit breaker, the<br>
corresponding section of the power transmission line<br>
will be disconnected from the network even though no<br>
short to ground was present there. Such spurious<br>
tripping can be prevented by the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows an advantageous development of the<br>
arrangement for producing a fault signal which<br>
indicates a short to ground. Components which<br>
correspond to Figure 1 are identified by the same<br>
reference symbols. In addition to the arrangement shown<br>
in Figure 1, a module for stabilized sum current<br>
detection 10 and a module for sum current/negative<br>
phase sequence system current comparison 11 are shown<br>
in Figure 2, and these modules are connected' on the<br>
input side to the current transformers 2a, 2b, 2c and<br>
on the output side to the evaluation device 6.<br>
The module for stabilized sum current detection 10<br>
allows the current threshold value with which the sum<br>
current 3I0 is compared to be dynamically matched to the<br>
magnitude of the maximum phase conductor current IPh<br>
This is explained in more detail in Figure 3. Figure 3<br>
shows a diagram in which the sum current 3I0 is plotted<br>
against the maximum phase conductor current IPh. The<br>
solid line denotes the characteristic 15 on the basis<br>
of which the respective threshold value is set for the<br>
sum current 3I0- As can be seen, the threshold value in<br>
each case rises for high phase currents, IPh, while the<br>
threshold value is constant for low phase current Iph,.<br>
If a corresponding value pair (3I0, Iph) is now located<br>
in the area identified by "enable" above the<br>
characteristic 15, then a short to ground is identified<br>
on the basis of the sum current criterion. If a<br>
corresponding value pair (3I0, Iph) is located<br>
underneath the characteristic (that is to say in the<br>
area identified by "inhibit"), then a short without<br>
ground contact is identified on the basis of the sum<br>
current criterion.<br>
The module for sum current/negative phase sequence<br>
system current comparison allows the sensitivity and<br>
reliability of the arrangement to be further improved.<br>
The method of operation is explained in the diagram<br>
illustrated in Figure 4, where the sum current 3I0 is<br>
plotted against the negative phase sequence system<br>
current 3I2. The negative phase sequence system current<br>
3I2 is in this case determined using equation 3:<br><br>
where a = ej(2p /3) In the diagram shown in Figure 4, a<br>
typical value range is defined for producing a further<br>
short to ground suspicion signal. If a value pair<br>
(3I0, 3I2) occurs in this area which is identified by<br>
"enable" in Figure 4, then the further short to ground<br>
suspicion signal is produced, but no short to ground<br>
suspicion signal is produced if it is located in the<br>
area identified by "inhibit". The two areas ("enable",<br>
"inhibit") are separated from one another by the<br>
characteristic 20.<br>
The method of operation in the event of current<br>
transformer saturation corresponds to the method<br>
described in Figure 1. If current transformer<br>
saturation is identified in the . saturation<br>
identification device 5, then, in consequence, a fault<br>
signal F which indicates a short to ground is produced<br>
only when the residual voltage 3U0 is above the voltage<br>
threshold value. In this case, the sum current<br>
criterion is not used for the decision on whether the<br>
short to ground is present.<br>
