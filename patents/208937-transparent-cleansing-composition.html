COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
1. Title of the invention. -      TRANSPARENT    COMPOSITION          <br>
2. Applicant	-        (a) Hindustan Lever Limited<br>
b) of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c) A company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/153,355 filed September 10, 1999.<br>
  The invention relates tq a shower gel formulation.<br>
Shower gel formulations which are mild to the skin are well known in the art.  Such a formulation may optionally contain  skin feel agents, such as cationic polymers.  However, when  one desires to suspend particulates and/or beads in the   formulation, frequently substantial quantities of anionic  surfactants have been incorporated, and provide clear  solutions.  Unfortunately, the addition of such anionic   surfactants diminishes the mildness of the shower gel    formulation.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,656,257 (Fealy et al., issued on August 12, 1997), which is here incorporated by reference,   discloses an anionic shampoo and conditioning composition comprising an oily conditioning agent, a shampooing agent, and an acrylate copolymer, a cationic conditioning agent and water.  In this formulation, the acrylate copolymer is used to suspend the anionic shampooing and cationic conditioning agent and prevent' it then from inactivating cr.e  another. U.S. Patent No. 5,656,257 does not, however, disclose a clear, mild cleansing composition containing a combination of surfactant types, which is capable of suspending beads or other insoluble particulates or gas bubbles.<br><br><br>
U.S.   Patent  No.   4,552,685   (Kernstock et   al.,   issued  November 12,   1985),   which  is  here   incorporated  by  reference, discloses  examples  of useful  acrylate. polymers  and copolymers  capable of  thickening mild cleansing  agents containing amphoteric surfactants  and betaines.     However, there is  no teaching  in that  patent  regarding  the compatability of cationic polymer conditioning  agents  in the formulation,   nor the  suspending power of  the  solution  for insoluble beads,   particulates  or  gaseous bubbles.<br>
U.S.   Patent  No.   3,759,861   (Shimokawa,   issued September  18, 1973),   which is here  incorporated by reference,   discloses a clear polymer adhesive  complex of an  acrylate  containing polymer and  surfactant used to  produce  a  flocculant. However,   there is  no disclosure  of a shower gel  or other cleansing  composition containing  a cationic conditioning agent  or complex which can  suspend particulates  or gas bubbles.<br>
The present  invention  comprises  a  shower  gel  formulation having a clear appearance and which suspends beads   (e.g. agar/Ti02/sunflower oil beads),   insoluble  particles  and gas bubbles while having  one or more  acrylate'  copolymers,   a betaine or  other amphoteric  surfactant and a cationic polymer   (e.g.   guar)   present  in   the  formulation.<br>
It  is   known  that  anionic acrylates   (i.e.   Aculyn  type acryiates   (available   from  ISP)),   being  anionic ..polymers-are generally considered  to  be  incompatible  with  cationic charged  ingredients.   It   is   further   known  that  polymeric, cationics,   as  well  as   some,..large,   bulky   quaxernary<br><br><br>
materials, can possibly be incorporated in formulations containing such acrylates.  The optimum order of addition in these instances generally requires the acrylate to be neutralised with a base prior to the addition of any   cationics.<br>
The applicants have discovered that a clear or transparent product can be produced by either partially neutralising such acrylates prior to cationic addition or after, cationic addition.  Clarity or transparency is herein defined as having a turbidity less than or equal to 105 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units).<br>
The applicants have further discovered that amphoteric surfactants, such as betaine (which is also cationic in nature and not a true amphoteric), may be optionally added to the inventive formulation in the range of 0.01 - 15 weight percent, preferably 1-10 weight percent to increase mildness without creating noticeable haziness.  Prior art shower gels that suspend beads or particulate matter are primarily composed of anionic surfactant and structurant which in most cases are harsher than the inventive formula.<br>
In.one embodiment, the present invention provides an aqueous, clear shower gel which is capable of suspension, comprising:<br>
About 10-20 weight percent of at least one anionic surfactant;<br><br><br>
About 2-15 weight percent of ac least one betaine or other amphoteric surfactant;<br>
About 2-15 weight percent of at least one acrylate copolymer;<br>
About 0.05 - 2 weight percent of at least one cationic polymer;<br>
About 0.1-5 weight percent of beads or particulates;<br>
About 0.1-5 weight percent of a benefit agent such as a water soluble or dispersible silicone polymer;<br>
About 0.1-2 weight percent of a preservative such as a biocide;<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides an aqueous, clear cleansing gel that is capable of suspending insoluble material or gas bubbles, comprising:<br>
a.	about 5 to 30, preferably 8 to 20 weight percent<br>
of at least one anionic surfactant;<br>
b.	about 2 to 15, preferably 2 to 10 weight percent<br>
of at least .one amphoteric surfactant;<br>
c.	about 0.1 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight<br>

d.	about 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.1 to 2 weight<br>
percent of at least one cationic polymer;<br>
e.	about 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.05 to 3 weight<br>
percent  of    at least one insoluble component<br><br><br>
selected from the group consisting of beads, particulates, water insoluble liquids and gas bubbles;<br>
f.	about 50 to 85 weight percent of water<br>
g.	about 1.9:1 to 15:1, preferably 1.9:1 to 10:1<br>
weight percent ratio range of anionic surfactant<br>
to amphoteric surfactant;<br>
h.   about 0.1:1 to 15:1, preferably 0.3;1 to 10:1,<br>
weight percent ratio range of the sum of cationic polymer and amphoteric surfactant to acrylate           copolymer; and<br>
wherein the concentration of acrylate copolymer is sufficient to suspend said at least one insoluble component, preferably wherein the viscosity range is between 6,000 and 20,000 cps, and the pH is in the range of 5.5 to 7,0.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention provides an aqueous, clear cleansing gel which is capable of suspending insoluble material or gas bubbles, comprising:<br>
a.	about 5 to 30, preferably 8 to 20 weight percent<br>
of at least one anionic surfactant;<br>
b.	about 0.1 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight<br>
percent of at least one acrylate copolymer;<br>
c.	about 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.1 to 2 weight<br>
percent of at least one cationic polymer;<br>
d.	about 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.05 to.3 weight<br>
percent of at least one insoluble component<br>
selected from the group consisting of beads.<br><br>
particulates, water insoluble liquids and gas bubbles; e.   about 50 to 85 weight percent of water;  and<br>
wherein the concentration of acrylate copolymer is sufficient to suspend said at least one insoluble component/ preferably wherein the viscosity range is between 6,000 and 20,000 cps, and the pH is in the rangeof 5.5 to 7,0.<br>

METHOD 1:<br>
The initial distilled water charge was added to a center turbine tank with wall scrape agitation and heated to 73.8°C (165°F) .  The temperature was maintained at 73.8°C (165°F). Agitation of the center turbine was increased as was the wall sweep so that there was a slight vortex.  Acrylate copolymer was added to the tank and mixed. The anionic surfactants were then added to the tank and mixed, and then the amphoteric surfactant was added and mixed.  The cationic polymer was premixed with propylene glycol if the cationic polymer was a solid, and was mixed well with no lumps. If the cationic polymer was a liquid, it was added straight to the tank. Then the glycerin was added. Agitation was decreased, and mixing was continued for 30 minutes at 73.8°C (165°F) and then cooled to 35°C (95 °F).  During the cooling process, the pH was measured and adjusted with an alkaline pH adjuster to clarity within a target pH range of 5.5 to 7.0.<br>
At 46.1°C (115 °F), the preservative was added and at 40.6°C (105°F) the fragrance was added and mixed well.  The mixture was then cooled to 35°C (95 °F) .  At- 35°C (95 °F), the viscosity was measured and adjusted with ammonium sulfate to the desired viscosity.  The insoluble components were added and mixed gently.  The mixture was then cooled to room temperature.<br><br><br>

METHODS<br>
Viscosity<br>
For the purposes of this invention, viscosity is measured using conventional techniques with a Brookfield viscometer, Model HBDVII+CP, spindle No. 41 at 0.5 rpm at 25°C.<br>
Turbidity<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the acceptability of formulation clarity was measured qualitatively and quantitively using a visual method of turbidity determination and a turbidimeter respectively.  Briefly, the visual method involves looking through a determined path length of the formulation to a visual target and determining if the visual target is legible or recognizable.  This target may be a straight line, a set of parallel lines, or a number or letter printed on white paper.  To assess turbidity, the test formulation was placed in a glass beaker such that the height from the bottom of the beaker to the top surface of the formulation was 10.16 cm (four inches). The formulation is made free of air bubbles. A piece of paper with the visual target is placed under the beaker. The assessor the looked through the top surface of the formulation to the visual target.  If the visual target appeared similar to the original, the formulation is of acceptable clarity and receives a 'pass' rating.  If the visual target appeared significantly hazy, cr is out of focus compared to the original target, the formulation is of unacceptable clarity and receives a 'fail' raring.<br><br><br>
Turbidity was quantitatively determined by a Turbidimeter, Model DRT-100D, manufactured by Shaban Manufacturing Inc, H. F. Instruments Division using a sample cuvette of 28 mm diameter by 91 mm in length with a flat bottom. Samples that had received a 'pass' rating from the visual method were found to have a turbidity measurement of less than or equal to 105 NTU's {Nephelometric Turbidity Units).  Samples that had received a  "fail" rating from the visual method were found to have a turbidity measurement of greater than 105 NTU's.<br>
The foregoing description and examples illustrate selected embodiments of the present invention.  In light thereof, variations and modifications will be suggested to one skilled in the art, all of which are written the scope and spirit of this invention.<br><br></td>
