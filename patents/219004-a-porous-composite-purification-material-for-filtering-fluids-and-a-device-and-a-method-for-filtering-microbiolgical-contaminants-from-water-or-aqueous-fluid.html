FILTERING FLUIDS AND A DEVICE AND METHOD FOR<br>
FILTERING MICROBIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS<br>
FROM WATER OR AQUEOUS FLUID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to composite materials and to devices<br>
incorporating these materials which are used in filters for solutions and other fluids.<br>
These filters find uses in filtration devices, fluid processing devices (primarily to<br>
aqueous solution filters and water purification), devices for emissions treatment of<br>
gases and of other aqueous liquids, which remove contaminants from the gas or<br>
aqueous liquid solution passed through them. In its more particular aspects, the<br>
invention relates to the field of devices that remove chemical and microbiological<br>
contaminants, including pesticides, metals, dissolved solids, cysts, bacteria, viruses,<br>
and components of these species from water or aqueous solutions.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Composite materials may be formed by a number of different techniques, such<br>
as sintering or firing, melting and cooling, extrusion, and molding. In general composite<br>
materials are generated from two or more unique chemical species; one or more<br>
species forms a matrix and binds or holds together the other species (a dispersed<br>
phase) into a unified form. A number of techniques for fabricating composite materials<br>
are known in the art.<br>
Purification, filtration, and processing of water or other aqueous solutions is<br>
necessary for many applications, from the provision of safe or potable drinking water to<br>
biotechnology applications including fermentation processing and separation of<br>
components from biological fluids. Similarly, the removal of microbial organisms from<br>
breathable air in hospitals and clean rooms, where ultrapurified air is required, and in<br>
environments where the air will be recirculated, such as aircraft or spacecraft, is also an<br>
important application for filtration media. In recent years, the need for air filtration and<br>
composite purification in the home has become more recognized, and the competing<br>

forms a matrix and binds or holds together the other species (a dispersed phase) into a<br>

Purification, filtration, and processing of water or other aqueous solutions is<br>

components from biological fluids. Similarly, the removal of microbial organisms from<br>
breathable air in hospitals and clean rooms, where ultrapurified air is required, and in<br>
environments where the air will be recirculated, such as aircraft or spacecraft, is also an<br>
important application for filtration media. In recent years, the need for air filtration and<br>
composite purification in the home has become more recognized, and the competing<br>
concerns of energy efficiency and indoor air quality have led to numerous air filtration<br>
products, such as HEPA filters and the like, that purport to remove small particles,<br>
allergens, and even microorganisms from the air.<br>
There are many well-known methods currently used for water purification, such as<br>
distillation, ion-exchange, chemical adsorption, filtering or retention, which is the<br>
physical occlusion of particulates. Particle filtration may be completed through the use of<br>
membranes or layers of granular materials, however in each case the pore size of the<br>
material and the void space between the granular materials controls the particle size<br>
retained. Additional composite purification media include materials that undergo<br>
chemical reactions, which alter the state or identity of chemical species in the fluid to be<br>
purified. Examples include emission control based upon metal catalysts.<br>
Materials that are highly efficient at removing, immobilizing, and converting<br>
chemical species and removing or inactivating microorganisms have numerous<br>
applications, but particular areas of application include generating purified water,<br>
processing chemical streams, and chemical stream conversion with catalysts,<br>
biotechnology, and fermentation processes. Composite materials are currently useful in<br>
many stages of the processing of fluids generated in each of these fields.<br>
In many practical fluid treatment and processing applications a combination of<br>
techniques and technologies are required in order to completely treat or process the fluid<br>
stream. As example in the treatment of water for drinking and food applications both<br>
chemical and microbiological purification are required before consumption.<br>
Combinations of technologies may be implemented by combining functions in a single<br>
device or using several devices in series where each performs a distinct function.<br>
Examples of combining technologies include the use of mixed ion exchange resins that<br>
remove both negative and positively charged species and the use of mechanical filtration<br>
in conjunction with chemical or radiative oxidation methods.<br>
In the fluid treatment applications listed previously containers of granular particles<br>
are used to treat and process fluids, liquids and gases, in order to convert components of<br>
the fluids into different species, remove contaminants and/or to isolate valuable<br>
components. Particularly it is well known to use granular absorption materials for<br>
removing microorganisms as well as organic and inorganic chemical contaminants.<br>
Granular adsorption materials include ion exchange resins, and activated and inactivated<br>
carbonaceous materials. It is also known to use naturally occurring minerals such as<br>
apatite, tricalcium phosphate and alumina based ores and some derivatives thereof in<br>
granular, particulate or fiber form as a water treatment material. An example of the use of<br>
apatite and alumina includes the commercial products available from Water Visions<br>
International Inc. and the prior art described in patent application (U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,755,969). These materials address both the chemical and microbiological contaminants<br>
in water systems.<br>
One of the most common methods of applying granular fluid treatment materials<br>
involves the loading or containment of the treatment particles in a suitable housing fitted<br>
with screens that do not allow the loss of the granular material (particles). Many different<br>
devices may be fabricated with the contained particulate material. These devices are used<br>
by consumers and commercial entities for chemical analysis, chemical stream processing,<br>
waste and exhaust treatment, biotechnology and drinking water treatment.<br>
Although devices employing granular materials can be very simple in design they<br>
rarely provide sufficient performance for the most critical applications. For example,<br>
simple point-of-use fluid composite purification devices, such as water filters attached to<br>
in-house water supply conduits do not provide microbiological water purification at levels<br>
required for safe consumption.<br>
Reasons for the lack of performance of granular materials and devices that contain<br>
granular materials involves the mobility of the granular material inside the container over<br>
time. Particle contact and subsequent grinding leads to particle size reduction.<br>
Contaminants contained in the fluid stream over time foul particle surfaces which leads to<br>
particle aggregation. The ultimate result of these situations is fluid channeling and bypass<br>
of the granular fluid treatment materials.<br>
Methods for improving fluid-particle contact and limiting fluid bypass have<br>
focused on technology that provides particle immobilization. Particle immobilization has<br>
been obtained by the fibrillation of Teflon (U.S. Patents 5071610 and 4194040) and by<br>
use of polymer binders as that described in US patents 5249948, 5189092, 5147722,<br>
5019311, and by using materials produced by 3M Corp., Fibredyne Inc. and<br>
WaterVisions International Inc. In each of these examples, however, expensive industrial<br>
equipment is required for generation of the composite materials.<br>
Additionally, significant technical know-how and expertise is required for large<br>
scale production of usable composite materials. Finally, these technologies are difficult<br>
to universally apply to the immobilization of different types of fluid treatment granular<br>
materials, mixtures of fluid treatment materials, and in addressing the wide range of fluid<br>
treatment situations that currently exist.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need in the industry for a way to simply and rapidly<br>
immobilize different fluid treatment granular materials so that fluid contact with them is<br>
improved. Additionally, these composite materials must inexpensively facilitate the<br>
fabrication of different shape and size devices for the wide range of fluid treatment<br>
situations that currently exist.<br>
Organic superabsorbent materials currently have two primary uses. These include<br>
use in personal care/hygiene products, such as diapers, incontinence products and<br>
feminine care products, and use as components of protective coatings where the<br>
superabsorbent stops water penetration, for example, in conjugation with electrical<br>
conductors. Secondary applications include use as ion exchange materials for water<br>
treatment, and in agriculture soil additives where water is retained by the absorbent for<br>
plant use. Inorganic expandable matter, such as bentonite, is used in formulations for<br>
sealing cracks and holes in ponds and fluid containment structures. In each of these prior<br>
applications the expanding matter is used to either remove water from a location, thereby<br>
drying the location, to stop the penetration of water, e.g. to keep water from moving<br>
through a shielding that protects electrical components, or to store or sequester water for<br>
later use or disposal. None of these uses relate to composite materials that have been<br>
fabricated for the purpose of facilitating fluid passage and chemical/biological<br>
manipulation under controlled situations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To this end, the present inventors have discovered a novel composite materials for<br>
fluid treatment and a new mechanism for generating them. Composite materials are<br>
formed by combining material that does not expand substantially in the presence of the<br>
fluid to be treated or some other fluid and a material that does expand substantially in the<br>
presence of the fluid to be treated or some other fluid. The expanding material forms a<br>
matrix that locks into position both the expanding and non-expanding material thereby<br>
forming a composite. The invention is applicable to all types of fluid insoluble particles<br>
and mixtures thereof. The invention can be used in a wide range of devices with<br>
significant consumer and industrial application. In a preferred application the composite<br>
materials may be fabricated in the form of blocks, tubes, sheets, or films, and are used to<br>
modify the properties of fluids, which pass over or through the composite material<br>
generated with both types of matter. At least, the non-expanding material is one that will<br>
remove, transform, or inactivate one or more contaminates or undesired components.<br>
As described above, the effectiveness of fluid treatment devices generated with<br>
materials in loose form can be compromised by channeling and by-pass effects caused by<br>
the pressure of fluid, such as water and aqueous solutions, flowing through the treatment<br>
material, as well as by particle erosion and aggregation. Because chemical species, as<br>
well as viruses and bacteria, are removed, transformed, or inactivated by intimate contact<br>
with the treatment material, even relatively small channels or pathways in the granular<br>
material formed over time by water pressure, water flow, particle erosion, or particle<br>
aggregation are sufficient to allow passage of undesirable chemical and microbiological<br>
contaminants through the treatment device.<br>
This invention solves this problem by providing porous composite fluid treatment<br>
materials, devices for fluid treatment containing these materials, and methods for making<br>
them that can process or remove chemical contaminants such as organics and inorganics,<br>
as well as microbiological contaminants including bacteria, cysts, and viruses from the<br>
fluid stream, while eliminating fluid channeling and contaminate by-pass by the<br>
combination of the non-expanding and expanding treatment materials which occurs in the<br>
device.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a device and method for the treatment, purification,<br>
and filtration of aqueous fluids, in particular water (such as drinking water or swimming<br>
or bathing water), or other aqueous solutions (such as fermentation broths and solutions<br>
used in cell culture), or gases and mixtures of gases, such as breathable air, found in clean<br>
rooms, hospitals, diving equipment, homes, aircraft, or spacecraft, and gases used to<br>
sparge, purge, or remove particulate matter from surfaces. The method may be easily<br>
adapted to process streams that use catalysts such as those found in the petroleum<br>
industry and the gas-emission clean-up industries, which convert gases that are toxic or<br>
environmentally unacceptable to non-harmful species. The use of the devices according<br>
to the invention can result in the removal of an extremely high percentage of<br>
microbiological contaminants, including bacteria and viruses and components thereof. In<br>
particular, the use of the device and method of the invention results in purification of<br>
water to a level that meets the EPA standards for designation as a microbiological water<br>
purifier.<br>
In typical embodiments, the invention relates to a composite purification material<br>
for fluids that contain particulate carbon, apatite, alumina or aluminosilicate materials and<br>
is in the form of a porous material as the result of the presence of the expanding material.<br>
Typically the carbon is activated through standard practices. Typically, at least a portion<br>
of this apatite is in the form of hydroxylapatite, and has been obtained from natural<br>
sources, e.g., as bone char, or from synthetic sources such as the mixing of calcium and<br>
phosphate containing compounds. Typically, at least a portion of the aluminosilicate is in<br>
the form of bauxite or alumina, and has been obtained from natural or synthetic sources.<br>
Also typically, the expanding material is a polymeric or oligomeric material that is<br>
capable of expanding sufficiently on contact with water or some other fluid that it<br>
immobilizes the particulate apatite or aluminosilicate in a composite material structure.<br>
This allows the composite purification material to take any desired shape, e.g., a shape<br>
suitable for inclusion into the housing of a filtration device, which provides for fluid<br>
inflow and outflow. Such a device forms another embodiment of the invention. In<br>
addition to maintaining the carbon, apatite, alumina, or aluminosilicate particles<br>
immobilized in a unitary composite material, the polymeric or oligomeric expanding<br>
material also provides desirable functional characteristics to the device, e.g., rendering it<br>
rigid or flexible, depending upon the type and amount of polymeric or oligomeric<br>
expanding material used. Further still the expandable material can provide additional<br>
purification of the water.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a composite purification material<br>
for fluids that are in the form of a sheet or membrane, containing the particulate carbon,<br>
apatite, alumina, or aluminosilicate immobilized with expanding matter.<br>
The invention also relates to methods of filtering fluids, such as water, aqueous<br>
solutions, and gases, to remove a large proportion of one or more types of chemical<br>
contaminants and microorganisms contained therein, by contacting the fluid with the<br>
composite purification material of the invention. In a particular aspect of this<br>
embodiment of the invention, this contacting occurs within the device described above,<br>
with the unfiltered fluid flowing through an inlet, contacting the composite purification<br>
material in one or more chambers, and the filtered fluid flowing out of the chamber<br>
through an outlet and having a significantly decreased concentration of microorganisms<br>
and/or chemical contaminants.<br>
Composite purification materials prepared with the invention can be used to purify<br>
drinking water, to purify water used for recreational purposes, such as in swimming<br>
pools, hot tubs, and spas, to purify process water, e.g. water used in cooling towers, to<br>
purify aqueous solutions, including but not limited to, fermentation broths and cell culture<br>
solutions (e.g., for solution recycling in fermentation or other cell culture processes) and<br>
aqueous fluids used in surgical procedures for recycle or reuse, and to purify gases and<br>
mixtures of gases such as breathable air, for example, air used to ventilate hospital or<br>
industrial clean rooms, air used in diving equipment, or air that is recycled, e.g., in<br>
airplanes or spacecraft, as well as gases used to sparge, purge or remove volatile or<br>
particulate matter from surfaces, containers, or vessels. The method may be easily<br>
adapted to process streams that use catalysts, such as in the petroleum industry and the<br>
gas-emission clean-up industries. Composite purification materials of the invention and<br>
devices generated with these materials have the additional advantage of being able to<br>
make use of readily available carbonaceous, apatite and/or alummosilicate materials,<br>
including those obtained from natural sources, while still maintaining high chemical and<br>
microbiological purification efficiency.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the fluid purification materials of the<br>
invention, namely the non-expanding and expanding material and formed into a<br>
composite material or sheet, can be used as an immobilization medium for<br>
microorganisms used in biotechnology applications such as fermentation processes and<br>
cell culture. In this embodiment, microorganisms are immobilized in the composite<br>
material, and biological process fluids, such as nutrient broths, substrate solutions, and the<br>
like, are passed through the immobilization material of the invention in a manner that<br>
allows the fluids to come into contact with the microorganisms immobilized therein, and<br>
effluent removed from the material and further processed as needed.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the fluid purification materials of the<br>
invention, namely non-expanding and expanding matter and formed into a composite<br>
material or sheet, can be used as an immobilization medium for catalysts used in chemical<br>
and biotechnology applications such as fermentation processes, industrial emission<br>
control, petroleum processing, and chemical stream processing. In this embodiment,<br>
chemical or biological process fluids, such as gas streams, hydrocarbon containing<br>
solutions, and the like, are passed through the immobilization material of the invention in<br>
a manner that allows the fluids to come into contact with the catalysts immobilized<br>
therein. The catalysts cause the reactive species in the fluid to undergo reaction, thereby<br>
reducing their concentration in the effluent, which can then be removed from the material<br>
and further processed as needed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
As indicated above in the Summary, in its general embodiments the invention<br>
relates to a fluid composite purification material in the form of a composite material filter<br>
containing granulated carbon, apatite, alumina, or aluminosilicates, with expanding<br>
material, which is typically a polymeric material that expands when in contact with water<br>
or some other fluid. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the invention relates to a<br>
composite material filter that contains a mixture of a distributed phase containing one or<br>
more of granulated apatite and derivatives thereof, granulated activated charcoal (GAC),<br>
alumina, or other adsorptive media such as bauxite, alumina silicates, or ion exchange<br>
resins, in combination with immobilizing matrix phase containing material that will<br>
expand in volume when in contact with water or other fluid, such as a polyacrylic acid<br>
material. The distributed phase becomes fixed by the expanding matter, and that<br>
channeling from flow during fluid treatment cannot occur. The fluid composite<br>
purification material of the invention can be produced simply by mixing particles of each<br>
type together in random fashion. The mixture of expanding material and non-expanding<br>
fluid treatment particles are then formed into a block, sheet, film, or coating when fluid is<br>
introduced to the material. Devices may be produced in any shape or size and may be<br>
rigid or flexible. The pore size of the filter composite material influences flow rates of<br>
the fluid through the filter, and is a function of the size of the granular particles<br>
incorporated into the filter composite material as well as the relative ratio of expanding<br>
and nonexpanding materials. As used herein, the term "composite material" does not<br>
denote any particular geometrical shape. Nonlimiting examples of "composite materials"<br>
as this term is intended to be used include tubes and annular rings, as well as more<br>
conventional geometrical solids. Material formed into flexible composite materials is<br>
particularly suitable for use in pipes or tubes that serve as the fluid filter medium.<br>
One of the desirable features of purification materials generated with the invention<br>
is that devices may be formed into any desired shape. This provides ease of handling and<br>
extremely high scalability. For example, a composite purification material may be<br>
formed into a monolith or wrapped sheet that fits into conventional housings for filtration<br>
media. It can be shaped to provide purification as part of a portable or personal water or<br>
breathing filtration system. The material may be formed into several different pieces,<br>
through which water flows in series or in parallel. Sheets or membranes of the composite<br>
purification material may also be formed. The rigidity of the purification material and<br>
subsequent devices, whether in block form or in sheet/membrane form, may be altered<br>
through inclusion of flexible support structures that contain the expanding and non-<br>
expanding material.<br>
Particle immobilization or locking mechanism:<br>
The expanding material may be in the form of particles ranging in size from 0.1<br>
microns through 10 millimeters, fibers with diameters of 0.5 microns through 10<br>
millimeters, or sheets of woven or non-woven materials that have thicknesses of 0.5<br>
microns through 10 millimeters. In a preferred application expanding particles are used<br>
to form the composite. It is also preferred that the expanding particles are similar in size<br>
to the particles of non-expanding matter, to reduce separation of particle types.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the mechanism for<br>
immobilizing both particle types involves the swelling of the expandable matter upon<br>
contact with a fluid, typically water or an aqueous solution. This generates significant<br>
physical stresses on all particles and on structural supports. The force generated by the<br>
expandable particles remains present as long as these particles remain partially or fully<br>
swollen. In a preferred embodiment the expanding particles are restricted from fully<br>
swelling by the presence of the non-swelling particles and by the presence of support<br>
structures.<br>
Surface contact between non-expanding and expanding matter:<br>
In other materials, surface contact between the "binder" and the "functional"<br>
particles has included entrapment as well as "surface-point-binding." In this invention,<br>
intimate interaction between particle types may be generated using a number of different<br>
techniques which may include force point pressure electrostatic interactions between<br>
surfaces with different electrical charge characteristics, hydrophobic binding between<br>
materials with similar surface polarities and molecular structure, molecular locking<br>
mechanisms that include specific molecular binding sites or receptors, as well as known<br>
chemical reactions that form permanent or transient chemical bonds. For example, the<br>
contact points between the swellable or expandable material and the non-expanding<br>
material may involve ionic interaction between acid moieties on one of the materials and<br>
divalent species (such as calcium, magnesium, copper, silver, etc.) or acid moieties and<br>
multivalent species (such as iron, aluminum, chromium, and other multivalent metal<br>
ions).<br>
Spatial Location of the different types of material:<br>
The spatial locations of the two particle types may vary. In preferred<br>
embodiments the swelling particles are present randomly mixed with the non-swelling<br>
particles, isolated on the periphery of the non-expanding particles, or contained in the<br>
support structure used to contain the non-expanding particles. It should be obvious to<br>
anyone familiar with the art that fibrous materials and sheets of woven and non-woven<br>
materials with the ability to expand may also be used in a fashion that provides similar<br>
results.<br>
Porosity of the composite materials:<br>
It is well known in the art of preparing composite materials that pore density and<br>
size are important material parameters that can vary with the use to which the material<br>
will be put. The passage of fluids, liquids and gases, through a material is dependent<br>
upon the pore characteristics. In the described technology the pore characteristics in the<br>
composite material are manipulated and "tuned" by controlling the particle size, fiber<br>
dimensions, or sheet thickness of the expanding and nonexpanding material as well as the<br>
ratio of expanding and non-expanding material. The immobilization of all particles by<br>
the presence of the expanding particles serves to generate composite materials where the<br>
pores or void spaces are located between similar or different particle types. It should be<br>
noted that each of the particulate materials will have a characteristic pore structure which<br>
will assist and take part in the specific fluid treatment application.<br>
Preferred and applicable Non-expanding Material:<br>
The non-expanding particles that may be immobilized in this art include activated<br>
and inactivated carbons, metal oxides such as alumina, titanium dioxide, and catalytic<br>
materials generated from these components and those experienced in the art will<br>
recognize the deposition of molecules containing active sites which include metals and<br>
atoms and nanocomposites of metals and semimetals on the surface of support materials<br>
is an obvious extension of the invention.<br>
Other natural and synthetic minerals may be immobilized in this technology<br>
including those known as aluminosilicates such as bauxites, kaolin, and clinoptiloiite, and<br>
phosphate containing minerals such as the apatites. Specifically phosphate minerals<br>
including hydroxyapatite and materials containing hydroxyapatite including Bone Char<br>
are applicable.<br>
Pure metal particles as well as alloys including brass, copper, zinc, and the<br>
precious metals may be immobilized with the described art.<br>
Additionally mixtures of all of these particle types may be immobilized with the<br>
same general method. Thus metal coated oxides which are used as catalysts (platinum<br>
and rhodium) containing materials may be immobilized. Synthetic particles including<br>
ion-exchange resins, drug delivery particles, and slow release fertilizer type particles may<br>
be immobilized in a wide range of mixtures.<br>
Preferred and applicable expanding fluid treatment matter:<br>
Material that expands as a result of absorption of fluids (either gases or liquids)<br>
can be generated from a range of synthetic and natural materials. These materials include<br>
synthetic and natural polymers, as well as certain clays.<br>
The class of materials known as "superabsorbents" is particularly suitable in this<br>
regard. Superabsorbents are natural, synthetic, or mixed polymers which are not fully<br>
cross-linked. They may be classified as polyelectrolyte or nonpolyelectrolyte types as<br>
well covalent, ionic, or physical gelling materials. These materials have the capacity to<br>
absorb many times their own volume in fluid. Examples of synthetic materials include<br>
polyacrylic acids, polyacrylamides, poly-alcohols, polyamines, and polyethylene oxides.<br>
Natural sources include cellulose derivatives, chitins, and gelatins. Additionally mixtures<br>
of synthetic polymer and natural polymers either as distinct chains or in copolymers may<br>
be used to generate these absorbent materials. Examples include starch polyacrylic acid,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols and polyacrylic acid, starch and polyacrylonitrile, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, alginic acids carrageenans isolated from seaweeds, polysaccharides, pectins,<br>
xanthans, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), polyvinylpyridine,<br>
polyvinylbenzyltrimethylammonium salts. As those experienced in the art will<br>
understand the process of crosslinking the polymer chains derived from either source or<br>
from both sources, are variable and will effect the magnitude of fluid absorption, the<br>
types of fluids that can be absorbed. Additionally those experienced will understand that<br>
molecular characteristics such as polymer chain molecular weight and distribution will<br>
effect performance, and will know how to modify these parameters to vary the properties<br>
of the resulting composite consistent with the basic tenets of the invention.<br>
Inorganic sources of expanding particles include bentonite and other clays and<br>
aluminosilicates that increase in volume when fluid is absorbed.<br>
Other methods for the immobilization of "functional" particles use synthetic<br>
polymer binders that are either fibrillated, or melted to provide a means for entrapping<br>
and "point-bonding" of particulate materials. These methods require complex and costly<br>
equipment and significant know-how and expertise to perform properly. In these<br>
applications the binder serves a single purpose, which is to immobilize the "functional"<br>
particles.<br>
The material of this invention requires no expensive instrumentation or equipment,<br>
or significant expertise, as non-expanding and expanding particle types of any ratio and<br>
composition can simply be mixed and added to a supporting structure of sufficient size<br>
and strength to contain the expanded composite. This simplifies the manufacture of many<br>
different composite materials in many shapes and sizes. By contrast, the use of melted<br>
polymers (thermoplastics) as heretofore known, requires significant understanding of<br>
polymer characteristics, and expensive equipment such as extruders, molds, injection<br>
molds and the like. In order to change the shape and size of the composite material, new<br>
extruder dies and/or molds are required at considerable expense. These hardware<br>
modifications are not required in the invention.<br>
The invention has other advantages (in addition to being low cost and simple in<br>
application). These include the elimination of a heating step required to prepare liquid<br>
binders from thermoplastics and elastomers, and the quick development of new products<br>
having differing parameters or properties. For example, when using extruders the screw<br>
speed, barrel temperature and die shape and size must be optimized for each extruded<br>
material. Significant trial-and-error and technical know-how is required to generate such<br>
materials in stable and consistent fashion.<br>
This trial-and-error approach is not needed with the material of the invention.<br>
Current scientific knowledge provides a clear understanding for generating intimate<br>
contact between expanding and non-expanding matter.<br>
The invention is also advantageous because in many applications, the amount of<br>
expanding material is less than the amount of binder used in prior materials. This<br>
increases the amount of non-expanding material present per unit volume. In applications<br>
where the expanding material serves no role other than immobilization of the more<br>
functional material, this is a significant advantage. In the several embodiments described<br>
herein, the levels of expanding material are between 1 and 5 % and have been<br>
demonstrated at 2 to 2.5% based upon the combined weight of expanding and<br>
nonexpanding material. This is much lower than the cited prior art which uses binder<br>
levels between 10 and 30 percent and usually between 15 and 25 percent based on the<br>
filter composition.<br>
However, the present invention also allows for additional functionality besides<br>
merely "binding" the non-expanding material. The expanding material which serves to<br>
immobilize is also functional in that it may be swelled with fluid that contains active<br>
species or molecules to be delivered to the fluid stream that passes through the composite<br>
material. Those of skill in the art will recognize that solutions of drugs, pharmaceuticals<br>
and water conditioners may be used. Additionally, the same chemical functional groups<br>
that provide intimate contact between different particle types and structural supports may<br>
also serve in an active capacity facilitating ion exchange and particulate binding. In a<br>
particular embodiment, superabsorbents based upon polyacrylic acid and polyacrylamide<br>
are used. These materials have one or more surface charged functional groups that<br>
provide additional chemical and biologically active sites. As examples, the presence of<br>
positively or negatively charged groups allows for the binding of drugs and<br>
pharmaceuticals, control of concentration or release of bound species, including metals,<br>
ions, and particles that provide bacteriostatic or antiviral functions, the retention of<br>
dissolved solids from a liquid stream, and the retention of bacteria and viruses in the<br>
water or other fluid.<br>
An additional advantage of the invention relates to the temperature requirements<br>
for the method for making the composite material. The invention does not require the<br>
binder particles to be melted or fibrillated in order to immobilize the non expanding<br>
particles. This is in contradistinction to known processes, which are very temperature<br>
sensitive. As a result, the composite materials can be formed at any temperature where<br>
both particle types and the fluid used for swelling are stable. Composite materials can<br>
thus be prepared at very low temperatures, which facilitates the inclusion of chemical and<br>
biological species that are temperature sensitive.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the composite<br>
purification material of the invention achieves its unusually high efficiency in removing<br>
chemical contaminants and microorganisms from fluids partly as the result of the<br>
immobilization of the non-expanding treatment particles with the expanding material, and<br>
the necessity for fluid flowing through the composite purification material to follow an<br>
extended and tortuous path therethrough, instead of forming channels through the<br>
composite purification material as occurs in prior granular purification/filtration<br>
materials. This extended path ensures that the fluid contacts a larger proportion of the<br>
surface area of the particles, especially of the nonexpanding treatment particles, as well as<br>
preventing sustained laminar flow of the fluid through the purification material. This<br>
latter effect is believed to help prevent laminae of fluid containing chemicals and<br>
microorganisms from avoiding sustained contact with granular particles in the filter<br>
device. After the composite purification material has been in service for a period of time,<br>
additional filtration by occlusion will occur as adsorbed material accumulates in the pores<br>
of the composite purification material.<br>
Those familiar with the art of fluid filtration will understand that the pore size and<br>
physical dimensions of the composite purification material may be manipulated for<br>
different applications and that variations in these variables will alter flow rates, back-<br>
pressure, and the magnitude of chemical and/or microbiological contaminant removal.<br>
Likewise those knowledgeable in the art will recognize that variations in the percentages<br>
of each component of the composite purification material will provide variable utility.<br>
For example, increasing the percentage of expanding matter in the composite purification<br>
material will result in a material having an increased pressure drop and lower flow, while<br>
decreasing the percentage of expanding matter will result in a composite purification<br>
material having flow rate and pressure drop properties closer to that of granular materials.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the invention, the nonexpanding treatment<br>
particles contain apatite, used in the form of bone char, and granulated activated carbon<br>
(GAC) present in approximately equal amounts with the percentage of expanding material<br>
kept to a minimum. It will be recognized, however, that the apatite used in the invention<br>
may be obtained or derived from other natural or synthetic sources, and that mixtures of<br>
these different derivatives can provide differences in the properties of the composite<br>
purification material. For example, increased levels of silica in the ore to the filter<br>
composite material will result in decreased reduction of fluoride in the effluent water if<br>
water is used as the fluid. Calcining, purification, and heat treatments usually increase<br>
surface area and thus ion removal capabilities. This can be useful in, e.g. purifying<br>
fluorinated water in such a way as to maintain desirable ion levels therein. Adding<br>
fluoride to the filter composite material will result in a decreased reduction of fluoride in<br>
the effluent water, if water is used as the fluid. This can be useful in, e.g. purifying<br>
fluorinated water in such a way as to maintain desirable fluorine levels therein. Fluoride<br>
in the filter material may be obtained either by inclusion of fluorapatite-rich. apatite<br>
mixtures, inclusion of fluoride salts and compounds, or by pre-conditioning the composite<br>
purification material by passing through fluoride-containing solutions, which are retained<br>
by the expanding particles.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention, the nonexpanding treatment<br>
particles contain alumina, bauxite, kaolin or other aluminosilicate containing ore, and<br>
granulated activated carbon (GAC) present in approximately equal amounts with the<br>
percentage of expanding material kept to a minimum. It will be recognized, however, that<br>
the alumina used in the invention may be obtained or derived from other natural or<br>
synthetic sources, and that mixtures of these different ores can provide differences in the<br>
properties of the composite purification material. For example, increased levels of silica<br>
in the ore to the filter composite material will result in decreased reduction of fluoride in<br>
the effluent water if water is used as the fluid. Calcining, purification, and heat<br>
treatments usually increase surface area and thus ion removal capabilities. This can be<br>
useful in, e.g. purifying fluorinated water in such a way as to maintain desirable ion levels<br>
therein. Adding fluoride to the filter composite material will result in a decreased<br>
reduction of fluoride in the effluent water, if water is used as the fluid. This can be useful<br>
in, e.g. purifying fluorinated water in such a way as to maintain desirable fluorine levels<br>
therein. Fluoride in the filter material may be obtained either by inclusion of fluorapatite-<br>
rich apatite mixtures, inclusion of fluoride salts and compounds, or by pre-conditioning<br>
the composite purification material by passing through fluoride-containing solutions,<br>
which are retained by the expanding particles.<br>
Those experienced in the art will also understand that different crystal lattices are<br>
possible for apatite and aluminosilicate ores and for other adsorbent materials that can be<br>
used in the invention, and that these variations will yield differences in properties of the<br>
resulting composite purification material, as certain crystal structures improve and inhibit<br>
interactions with chemicals, microorganisms, and other biological materials. These<br>
differences in properties result from differences in interactions between the<br>
microorganisms and other biological materials and the chemical contaminants with the<br>
different positive and negative ions that are included in the crystal structure. The<br>
expanding material is capable of immobilizing all crystal types.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the composite purification material is<br>
constructed to withstand sterilization. Sterilization processes include thermal processes,<br>
such as steam sterilization or other processes wherein the composite purification material<br>
is exposed to elevated temperatures or pressures or both, resistive heating, radiation<br>
sterilization wherein the composite purification material is exposed to elevated radiation<br>
levels, including processes using ultraviolet, infrared, microwave, and ionizing radiation,<br>
and chemical sterilization, wherein the composite purification material is exposed to<br>
elevated levels of oxidants or reductants or other chemical species, and which is<br>
performed with chemicals such as halogens, reactive oxygen species, formaldehyde,<br>
surfactants, metals and gases such as ethylene oxide, methyl bromide, beta-propiolactone,<br>
and propylene oxide. Additionally, sterilization may be accomplished with<br>
electrochemical methods by direct oxidation or reduction with microbiological<br>
components or indirectly through the electrochemical generation of oxidative or reductive<br>
chemical species. Combinations of these processes are also used on a routine basis. It<br>
should also be understood that sterilization processes may be used on a continuous or<br>
sporadic basis while the composite purification material is in use.<br>
In general, the invention comprises a method and a means for fabricating devices<br>
for the filtration and purification of a fluid, in particular an aqueous solution or water, to<br>
remove organic and inorganic elements and compounds present in the water as particulate<br>
material. In particular, the device and method can be used to remove chemicals such as<br>
organics, pesticides, and heavy metals, as well as microbiological contaminants, including<br>
bacteria and viruses and components thereof, from water destined for consumption and<br>
use by humans and other animals. The method and devices of the invention are<br>
particularly useful in these applications where the reduction in concentration of<br>
microbiological contaminants obtainable with the invention addresses the EPA standards<br>
for microbiological water purification, and also significantly exceeds the effectiveness of<br>
other known filtration and composite purification devices incorporating granulated<br>
adsorption. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the composite purification<br>
material is a porous composite material formed by granulated or participate apatite, which<br>
is defined herein to include hydroxylapatite, chlorapatite, and/or fluorapatite, and other<br>
optional adsorptive granular materials, described in more detail below, such as granulated<br>
activated charcoal (GAC), alumina, and bauxite, retained with a polymeric matrix of<br>
expanding material. In the method corresponding to this particular embodiment, the<br>
microbiological contaminants are removed from the water when the water is forced<br>
through the porous composite material by water pressure on the influent side, or by a<br>
vacuum on the effluent side, of the filter composite material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention where the composite purification material is<br>
composed of a mixture of hydroxylapatite and an adsorptive granular filter media, for<br>
example GAC, these components can be dispersed in a random manner throughout the<br>
composite material. The composite purification material can also be formed with<br>
spatially distinct gradients or separated layers, for example, where the hydroxylapatite<br>
and GAC granules are immobilized in separate layers using expanding matter, for<br>
example a polymer superabsorbent such as polyacrylic acid or polyacrylamide or the like,<br>
so that movement of the hydroxylapatite and GAC particles is precluded and detrimental<br>
channeling effects during fluid transport through the composite material are prevented. If<br>
the components reside in separate locations the fluid flow is sequential through these<br>
locations.<br>
In a particular example of this embodiment, at least a portion of the apatite present<br>
is in the form of hydroxylapatite, which is added in the form of bone charcoal or bone<br>
char. An example of a suitable material is that designated as BRIMAC 216 and sold by<br>
Tate &amp; Lyle Process Technology. The material may be ground to a desirable particle<br>
size, e.g., 80-325 mesh. A typical analysis of this material shows 9-11% carbon, up to<br>
3% acid insoluble ash, up to 5% moisture, from approximately 70-76% hydroxylapatite<br>
(tricalcium phosphate), 7-9% calcium carbonate, 0.1-0.2% calcium sulfate and less than<br>
0.3% iron (calculated as Fe2O3). This material is produced in a granular form having a<br>
total surface area of at least 100 m2/g, a carbon surface area of at least 50 m2/g, pore size<br>
distribution from 7.5-60,000 ran and pore volume of 0.225 cm3/g. The element binding<br>
characteristics of this material have been reported and include chlorine, fluorine,<br>
aluminum, cadmium, lead, mercury (organic and inorganic), copper, zinc, iron, nickel,<br>
strontium, arsenic, chromium, manganese, and certain radionuclides. The organic<br>
molecule binding capabilities have been reported for complex organic molecules, color-<br>
forming compounds, compounds that add taste to fluids, compounds that add odors to<br>
fluids, trihalomethane precursors, dyestuffs, and tributyltin oxide.<br>
The bone char (containing hydroxylapatite) and the GAC are in this example<br>
mixed in approximately equal amounts with the minimal amount of expanding matter<br>
material necessary to compose a monolithic composite purification material. However,<br>
the concentrations of HA, of GAC, and of expanding matter are substantially variable,<br>
and materials having different concentrations of these materials may be utilized in a<br>
similar fashion without the need for any undue experimentation by those of skill in the<br>
art. In general, however, when GAC is used as the additional adsorbent material, its<br>
concentration in the mixture is generally less than 50 % by weight, based upon the weight<br>
of the composition before any drying or compacting. Additionally, adsorbents other than<br>
GAC may be substituted completely for, or mixed with, the GAC in a multicomponent<br>
mixture. Examples of these adsorbents include various ion-binding materials, such as<br>
synthetic ion exchange resins, zeolites (synthetic or naturally occurring), diatomaceous<br>
earth, and one or more other phosphate-containing materials, such as minerals of the<br>
phosphate class, in particular, minerals of the apatite group.<br>
In particular, minerals of the apatite group, i.e., a group of phosphates, arsenates,<br>
and vanadates having similar hexagonal or pseudohexagonal monoclinic structures, and<br>
having the general formula X5(ZO4)3 (OH, F, or Cl), wherein each X can independently be<br>
a cation such as calcium, barium, sodium, lead, strontium, lanthanum, and/or cerium<br>
cation, and wherein each Z can be a cation such as phosphorus, vanadium, or arsenic are<br>
particularly suitable for the invention.<br>
Additionally, polymeric materials used for ion-binding including derivatised resins<br>
of styrene and divinylbenzene, and methacrylate may be used. The derivatives include<br>
functionalized polymers having anion binding sites based on quaternary amines, primary<br>
and secondary amines, aminopropyl, diethylaminoethyl, and diethylaminopropyl<br>
substituents. Derivatives including cation binding sites include polymers functionalized<br>
with sulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, propylsulfonic acid, phosphonic acid, and/or<br>
carboxylic acid moieties.<br>
Natural or synthetic zeolites may also be used or included as ion-binding<br>
materials, including, e.g., naturally occurring aluminosilicates such as clinoptilolite,<br>
bauxite, kaolin and others.<br>
Suitable expanding materials include any polymeric material capable of<br>
immobilizing the particulate materials and maintaining this immobilization under the<br>
conditions of use. They are generally included in amounts ranging from about 0.1 wt% to<br>
about 99.9 wt%, more particularly from about 0.25 wt% to about 10 wt%, based upon the<br>
total weight of the composite purification material. Suitable polymeric materials include<br>
both naturally occurring and synthetic polymers, as well as synthetic modifications of<br>
naturally occurring polymers. The polymeric expanding materials generally include one<br>
or polyacrylic acids, polyacrylamides, poly-alcohols, polyamines, and polyethylene<br>
oxides. Natural sources include cellulose derivatives, chitins, and gelatins. Additionally<br>
mixtures of synthetic polymer and natural polymers either as distinct chains are in<br>
copolymers may be used to generate these absorbent materials. Examples include starch<br>
polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohols and polyacylic acid, starch and polyacrylonitrile,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, alginic acids carrageenans isolated from seaweeds,<br>
polysaacharides, pectins, xanthans, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride),<br>
polyvinylpyridine, polyvinylbenzyltrimethylamrnonium salts or a combination thereof,<br>
depending upon the desired mechanical properties of the resulting composite purification<br>
material.<br>
In general, polymers absorbing more than 1 gram of fluid to each gram of polymer<br>
can be particularly mentioned as suitable. Those of skill in the art will recognize that any<br>
polymeric matter that expands in volume as fluid is absorbed can be used in the invention<br>
in an analogous manner.<br>
In general inorganic clays and aluminosilicates may be used as the source of<br>
expanding matter. Examples include bentonite and similar clays. Those of skill in the art<br>
will recognize that any inorganic matter that expands in volume as fluid is absorbed can<br>
be used in the invention in an analogous manner and that in most cases inorganic<br>
materials will absorb less fluid per unit weight.<br>
Naturally occurring and synthetically modified naturally occurring polymers<br>
suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, natural and synthetically<br>
modified celluloses, such as cotton, eollagens, and organic acids. Biodegradable<br>
polymers suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, polyethylene<br>
glycols, polylactic acids, polyvinylalcohols, co-polylactideglycolides, starch,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, alginic acids, carrageenans isolated from seaweeds,<br>
polysaccharides, pectins, xanthans, and the like.<br>
In the specific embodiment of a filter material that may be sterilized, the apatite<br>
used is in the form of bone char, and GAC material is present in approximately equal<br>
amounts with the percentage of expanding matter material kept to a minimum. The<br>
expanding matter used must be stable to the temperature, pressure, electrochemical,<br>
radiative, and chemical conditions presented in the sterilization process, and should be<br>
otherwise compatible with the sterilization method. Examples of expanding matters<br>
suitable for sterilization methods involving exposure to high temperatures (such as steam<br>
sterilization or autoclaving) include polyacrylic acid and derivatives thereof and<br>
incorporating various counter ions. Composite purification materials prepared with these<br>
expanding matters can be autoclaved when the expanding matter polymers are prepared<br>
according to known standards. Desirably, the composite purification material is stable to<br>
both steam sterilization or autoclaving and chemical sterilization or contact with oxidative<br>
or reductive chemical species, as this combination of sterilizing steps is particularly<br>
suitable for efficient and effective regeneration of the composite purification material.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention wherein sterilization is at least in part<br>
conducted through the electrochemical generation of oxidative or reductive chemical<br>
species, the electrical potential necessary to generate said species can be attained by using<br>
the composite purification material itself as one of the electrodes. For example, the<br>
composite purification material, which contains polymeric expanding matter, can be<br>
rendered conductive through the inclusion of a sufficiently high level of conductive<br>
particles, such as GAC, carbon black, or metallic particles to render a normally insulative<br>
polymeric material conductive. Alternatively, if the desired level of carbon or other<br>
particles is not sufficiently high to render an otherwise insulative polymer conductive, an<br>
intrinsically conductive polymer or metal may be used as is or blended with the<br>
expanding matter. Examples of suitable intrinsically conductive polymers include doped<br>
polyanilines, polythiophenes, and other known intrinsically conductive polymers. These<br>
materials can be incorporated with or as the expanding material in sufficient amount to<br>
provide a resistance of less than about 1 kO, more particularly less than about 300 O.<br>
The composite purification material of the present invention may be in the form of<br>
a block, but need not be, and may also be formed into a sheet or film. This sheet or film<br>
may, in a particular embodiment, be disposed in a woven or nonwoven web of, e.g., a<br>
polymer. The polymer used to form the woven or nonwoven web may be any<br>
thermoplastic or thermosetting resin typically used to form fabrics. Polyolefins, such as<br>
polypropylene and polyethylene are particularly suitable in this regard.<br>
The efficiency of composite purification materials generated by the method of the<br>
invention in reducing microbiological contaminants is a function of the pore size within<br>
the composite material and the influent fluid pressure, as is the flow rate of the fluid<br>
through the material. At constant fluid pressure, flow rate is a function of pore size, and<br>
the pore size within the composite material can be regulated by controlling the size of the<br>
HA and GAC granules - large granule size providing a less dense, more open composite<br>
purification material which results in a faster flow rate, and small granule size providing a<br>
more dense, less open composite purification material which results in a slower flow rate.<br>
A composite material formed with relatively large HA granules will have less surface<br>
area and interaction sites than a composite material formed with smaller granules, and<br>
therefore the composite purification material of large granules must be of thicker<br>
dimension to achieve equal removal of microbiological contaminants. Because these<br>
factors are controllable within the manufacturing process, the composite purification<br>
materials can be customized by altering pore size, composite material volume and<br>
composite material outer surface area and geometric shape to meet different application<br>
criteria. Average pore size in a particular embodiment is kept to below several microns<br>
and more particularly to below about one micron, to preclude passage of cysts. It should<br>
be noted that the pore size described herein does not refer to the pores within the<br>
adsorbent or absorbent particles themselves, but rather to the pores formed within the<br>
composite purification material when the particles are immobilized together by the<br>
expanding material.<br>
The method of making the material of the invention, in its most general aspect,<br>
involves combining the non-expanding materials (and optional additional particulate<br>
adsorbent material(s)) with the expanding material and adding the combination to an<br>
appropriate container. At some point, a fluid capable of swelling the expanding material<br>
is added to the combination, with the result that the combination forms a composite. This<br>
addition of fluid need not occur, in certain instances, until the combination is put into<br>
service, but may occur earlier.<br>
The invention will now be described with regard to one particular embodiment and<br>
a mode of practicing it, which meets or exceeds the EPA requirements for<br>
microbiological filters. A typical specific embodiment of filtration apparatus containing<br>
the composite purification material of the invention, which incorporates a porous<br>
composite material filter. A removable housing is mated with a cap, the cap having an<br>
inflow orifice and an outflow orifice. A water supply conduit is joined to the inflow<br>
orifice to deliver non-treated water into the device, and a water discharge conduit is<br>
joined to the outflow orifice to conduct treated water from the device. Water passes into<br>
the housing and the pressure of the water flow forces it through the porous composite<br>
material filter member, which is formed in the shape of hollow cylinder with an axial<br>
bore, the treated water passing into the axial bore which connects to the outflow orifice.<br>
It is to be understood that other configurations where water is caused to pass through a<br>
porous filter composite material (which may have different geometrical shapes and/or<br>
different flow properties) are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. The<br>
composite material is formed by placing both expanding and non-expanding media<br>
between two capped porous tubes of which the outer tube limits the outer diameter and<br>
the inner tube is the central bore. Both tubes are chosen to have a pore size smaller than<br>
the particles used. In this specific embodiment the pore size of the tubes is less than 300<br>
microns and the tube composition is polyethylene.<br>
Two embodiments where the composite purification material of the invention is<br>
used in the form of a sheet or film are envisioned. A composite purification material used<br>
in connection with normal flow-through filtration has the fluid being filtered by passage<br>
through the sheet or film. Alternatively a composite purification material can be used in<br>
connection with crossflow filtration.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
As an example of a fully functional device, a cylindrical filter composite was<br>
prepared with a material composition of approximately 48.75% BRIMAC 216 bone char<br>
obtained from Tate and Lyle, approximately 48.75% granular activated carbon, and<br>
approximately 2.5% expanding matter material consisting of sodium polyacrylic acid<br>
obtained from Chemdal (a lithium counterion could also be used).<br>
The cylindrical or toroidally shaped composite material was approximately 9.8<br>
inches in length, with an outer diameter of approximately 2.5 inches and an inner<br>
diameter (the bore) of approximately 1.25 inches. This shape filter fits into a standard<br>
water filtration housing used in the home and industrial settings. The filter material had a<br>
resistance of about 300 O. The outer container which provides structural support for the<br>
particulate media is composed of porous polyethylene obtained from Porex. The tube is<br>
capped at the bottom and an appropriate fitting is provided at the top for connection the<br>
cap of the canister. This prototype was tested and found to reduce both food coloring in<br>
water as well as removing chlorine from water.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The filter prepared in Example 1 is challenged by exposing it to tap water that is<br>
filtered with activated carbon and is then seeded with 2.3x108 colony forming units per<br>
liter of E. coli bacteria and l.0xl07 plaque forming units per liter of poliovirus type 1.<br>
The seeded water is passed through the filter composite material at a flow rate of<br>
approximately 2 liters/minute for 3 minutes, followed by collection of a 500 ml effluent<br>
sample. E. coli is assayed on m-Endo agar plates by membrane filtration procedure, while<br>
the poliovirus type 1 is assayed by the plaque forming method on BGM cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
As example of a fully functional device, a cylindrical filter composite was<br>
prepared with a material composition of 97.5% KDF, a commercially available material<br>
composed of fine brass particles, and approximately 2.5% expanding matter material<br>
consisting of sodium polyacrylic acid from Chemdal.<br>
The cylindrical or toroidally shaped composite material was approximately 9.8<br>
inches in length, with an outer diameter of approximately 2.5 inches and an inner<br>
diameter (the bore 18) of approximately 1.25 inches. This shape filter fits into a standard<br>
water filtration housing used in the home and industrial settings. The filter material had a<br>
resistance of about 300 O. The outer container which provides structural support for the<br>
particulate media is composed porous polyethylene obtained from Porex. The tube is<br>
capped at the bottom and an appropriate fitting is provided at the top for connection the<br>
cap of the canister.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The filter prepared in Example 3 is challenged by exposing it to tap water that is<br>
filtered with activated carbon and is then seeded with 2.3x108 colony forming units per<br>
liter of E. coli bacteria and 1.0x107 plaque forming units per liter of poliovirus type 1.<br>
The seeded water is passed through the filter composite material at a flow rate of<br>
approximately 2 liters/minute for 3 minutes, followed by collection of a 500 ml effluent<br>
sample. E. coli is assayed on m-Endo agar plates by membrane filtration procedure, while<br>
the poliovirus type 1 is assayed by the plaque forming method on BGM cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The filter prepared in Example 1 was challenged by exposing it to tap water<br>
containing chlorine. The chlorine concentration reduction in the circulating water was<br>
quantitated using a commercial chlorine (pool) colorimetric test kit. The Chlorine level in<br>
the water (10 gallons) was increased by the addition of sodium hypochlorite to between<br>
10 and 20 ppm. After recirculating the water through the filter for several minutes<br>
chlorine levels were undetected.<br>
As described above, the composite material of the invention is extremely useful in<br>
the area of water purification, particularly the area of drinking water purification.<br>
Because of the extremely high efficiency with which the material of the present invention<br>
removes microorganisms from water, it meets and exceeds the EPA guidelines for<br>
materials used as microbiological water purifiers. In addition to functioning as a purifier<br>
for drinking water, the material of the invention can also be used to purify water used for<br>
recreational purposes, such as water used in swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas.<br>
As the result of the ability of the material of the invention to efficiently remove<br>
and immobilize microorganisms and other cells from aqueous solutions, it has numerous<br>
applications in the pharmaceutical and medical fields. For example, the material of the<br>
invention can be used to fractionate blood by separating blood components, e.g., to<br>
separate plasma from blood cells, and to remove microorganisms from other<br>
physiological fluids. The invention may be used to generate materials capable of<br>
providing materials for reverse osmosis techniques.<br>
The material can also be used in hospital or industrial areas requiring highly<br>
purified air having extremely low content of microorganisms, e.g., in intensive care<br>
wards, operating theaters, and clean rooms used for the therapy of immunosuppressed<br>
patients, or in industrial clean rooms used for manufacturing electronic and<br>
semiconductor equipment.<br>
The material of the invention has multiple uses in fermentation applications and<br>
cell culture, where it can be used to remove microorganisms from aqueous fluids, such as<br>
fermentation broths or process fluids, allowing these fluids to be used more efficiently<br>
and recycled, e.g., without cross-contamination of microbial strains. In addition, because<br>
the material is so efficient at removing microorganisms and at retaining them once<br>
removed, it can be used as an immobilization medium for enzymatic and other processing<br>
requiring the use of microorganisms. A seeding solution containing the desired<br>
microorganisms is first forced through the material of the invention, and then substrate<br>
solutions, e.g., containing proteins or other materials serving as enzymatic substrates, are<br>
passed through the seeded material. As these substrate solutions pass through the<br>
material, the substrates dissolved or suspended therein come into contact with the<br>
immobilized microorganisms, and more importantly, with the enzymes produced by those<br>
microorganisms, which can then catalyze reaction of the substrate molecules. The<br>
reaction products may then be eluted from the material by washing with another aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
The material of the invention has numerous other industrial uses, e.g., filtering<br>
water used in cooling systems. Cooling water often passes through towers, ponds, or<br>
other process equipment where microorganisms can come into contact with the fluid,<br>
obtain nutrients and propagate. Microbial growth in the water is often sufficiently robust<br>
that the process equipment becomes clogged or damaged and requires extensive chemical<br>
treatment. By removing microorganisms before they are able to propagate substantially,<br>
the present invention helps to reduce the health hazard associated with the cooling fluids<br>
and the cost and dangers associated with chemical treatment programs.<br>
Similarly, breathable air is often recycled in transportation systems, either to<br>
reduce costs (as with commercial airliners) or because a limited supply is available (as<br>
with submarines and spacecraft). Efficient removal of microorganisms permits this air to<br>
be recycled more safely. In addition, the material of the invention can be used to increase<br>
indoor air quality in homes or offices in conjunction with the air circulation and<br>
conditioning systems already in use therein. The composite purification material of the<br>
invention can also be used to purify other types of gases, such as anesthetic gases used in<br>
surgery or dentistry (e.g., nitrous oxide), gases used in the carbonated beverage industry<br>
(e.g., carbon dioxide), gases used to purge process equipment (e.g., nitrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide, argon), and/or to remove particles from surfaces, etc.<br>
The composite materials of the invention may be used to generate catalytic devices<br>
based upon chemicals such as metals and biochemical such as enzymes. These devices<br>
may be used to treat or remediate emission gases such as those generated by the chemical,<br>
mining, power, and manufacturing industries as well as those generated from consumer<br>
products such as those powered with combustion engines.<br>
In each of these applications, the method of using the material of the invention is<br>
relatively simple and should be apparent to those of skill in the filtration art. The fluid to<br>
be filtered is simply conducted to one side of a composite material or sheet of material of<br>
the invention, typically disposed in some form of housing, and forced through the<br>
material as the result of a pressure drop across the composite purification material.<br>
Purified, filtered fluid is then conducted away from the "clean" side of the filter and<br>
further processed or used.<br>
The invention having been thus described by reference to certain of its specific<br>
embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that many variations and<br>
modifications of these embodiments may be made within the spirit of the invention,<br>
which are intended to come within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents<br>
