				<td>PREPARATION AND PURIFICATION OF SYNTHETIC CAPSAICIN<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods of preparing and purifying synthetically prepared capsaicin.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Capsaicin, a pungent substance derived from me plants of the solanaceae family (hot chili peppers) has long been used as an experimental tool because of its selective action on the small diameter afferent nerve fibers C- fibers and A-delta fibers that are believed to signal pain. From studies in animals, capsaicin appears to trigger C- fiber membrane depolarization by opening cation channels permeable to calcium and sodium. Recently one of the receptors for capsaicin effects has been cloned. Capsaicin can be readily obtained by ethanol extraction of the fruit of capsicum frutescens or capsicum annum. Capsaicin is known by the chemical name N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8~ methylnon-trans-6-enamide. Capsaicin is practically insoluble in water, but freely soluble in alcohol, ether, benzene and chloroform. Therapeutically capsaicin has been used as a topical analgesic. Capsaicin is available commercially as Capsaicin USP from Steve Weiss &amp; Co., 315 East 68th Street, New York, NY 10021 and can also be prepared synthetically by published methods. See Michalska et al., "Synthesis and Local Anesthetic Properties of N-substituted 3,4-Dimethoxyphenethylamine Derivatives", Diss Pharm. Pharmacol., Vol. 24, (1972), pp. 17-25, (Chem. Abs. 77: 1927 la), discloses N-pentyl and N-hexyl 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetamides which are reduced to the respective secondary amines. Capsaicin (USP) contains not less than 110% total capsaicinoids which typically corresponds to 63% pure capsaicin. USP capsaicin is trans-capsaicin (55-60%) and also contains the precursors dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin.<br>
[0003] Although detailed mechanisms are not yet known, capsaicin mediated effects include: (i) activation of nociceptors in peripheral tissues; (ii) eventual desensitization of peripheral nociceptors to one or more stimulus modalities; (iii) cellular degeneration of sensitive A-delta and C-fiber afferents; (iv) activation of neuronal proteases; (v) blockage<br>
of axonal transport; and (vi) the decrease of the absolute number of nociceptive fibers without affecting the number of non-nociceptive fibers.<br>
[0004] Processes for the synthesis of capsaicin and analogues thereof have been reported, for example, by Crombie et al., "Amides of Vegetable Origin Part VI Synthesis of Capsaicin," Journal of the Chemical Society, pp. 1025-1027 (1955) describes an unambiguous synthesis of capsaicin, N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methylnon-trans-6-enamide, the active principle in red pepper. U.S Patent No. 4,493,848 issued to LaHann et al. on January 15,1985, describes N-[(substituted phenyl) methyl]-cis-monosaturated alkenamide compositions and methods of synthesizing the same for parenteral, oral and topical administration. U.S. Patent No. 5,094,782 issued to Chen et al. on March 10,1992, describes synthesis of nonanoyl vanillylamide succinate from synthetic capsaicin (nonanoyl vanillylamide) and succininc anhydride.<br>
[0005] In addition, other references report utilizing a Wittig reaction as the key step for the introduction of the double bond. However, the Wittig reaction always favors a cis alkene product. Thus additional steps, including fractional recrystallization, are required to isomerize and separate the cis product to the trans product.<br>
[0006] Alternative methods for the synthesis of capsaicin utilize the Claisen ester rearrangement as a means to selectively form the trans isomer of the olefin (alkene) double bond. Although superior to a Wittig reaction since a cis product is not possible, the use of the Claisen ester rearrangement produces an initial product, in which the carbon chain is too short. Thus, the chain must be lengthened after the Claisen step, prior to coupling with the benzyl amine to form the final product.<br>
[0007] It would be advantageous to provide a method for the synthesis of the trans isomer of capsaicin so as to provide for a total synthesis of the trans isomer without the additional steps required for the synthesis of capsaicin described in the prior art.<br>
[0008] Further, it would be advantageous to provide a method for purifying synthetic capsaicin prepared by the methods described herein.<br>
[0009] The present invention is directed in part to the fact that the trans geometry is set from the beginning of the synthesis reaction and carried through a straightforward four-step process. Moreover, the present invention is directed in part to the fact that synthetically prepared trans capsaicin can be purified with 99.0% or greater purity.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0035] The methods disclosed herein can be useful for the synthesis of trans capsaicin or trans capsaicin-like compounds.<br>
[0036] In certain other embodiments of the present invention, trans capsaicin is synthesized by the following chemical reaction:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0037] In a first step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin, a first intermediate is preferably synthesized by an alkylation reaction. In one preferred embodiment the first intermediate synthesized is preferably 8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid. The 8-methy]-6-nonynoic acid is preferably synthesized by alkylation of 3-methyl-butyne with a halovaleric acid such as bromovaleric acid, chlorovaleric acid, fluorovaleric acid, iodovaleric acid astatinovaleric acid, 1-mesyloxyvaleric acid and 1-tosyloxyvaleric acid.<br>
[0038] The alkylation reaction is preferably driven by the addition of solvents such as hexamethylphosphoramide and tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a suitable base, e.g., n-<br>
butyllithium (n-BuLi). In certain other embodiments of the present invention, alternative - bases such as secondary butyllithium (sec-BuLi), tertiary butyllithium (t-BuLi), lithium di(isopropyl) amide (LDA), sodium hydride (NaH), sodium amide (NaNH2), lithium amide (LiNH2), methyl lithium (MeLi), methyl magnesium bromide (MeMgBr), ethyl magnesium bromide (EtMgBr), alkyl or aryl magnesium halides and mixtures thereof can be used instead of butyllithium during the alkylation step.<br>
[0039] In certain other embodiments, the hexamethylphosphoramide can be replaced by l,2-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-(lH)pyrimidinone.<br>
[0040] In certain other embodiments, additional solvents such as ether may preferably be used during the alkylation reaction step.<br>
[0041] The crude product from step one synthesis is preferably purified by column chromatography.<br>
[0042] In certain other embodiments, the step 1 intermediate can be purified by acid-base extractions.<br>
[0043] In certain other embodiments, the step 1 intermediate can be purified by vacuum distillation or fractional vacuum distillation or low temperature crystallization.<br>
[0044] In a second step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin, a second intermediate is preferably synthesized by reduction of the first intermediate. In one preferred embodiment the second intermediate synthesized is preferably 8-methyl-6-nonenoic acid.<br>
[0045] The reduction reaction is preferably driven by lithium, t-BuOH, NH3/THF. However, in certain other embodiments, metal hydrides such as diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H), sodium in liquid ammonia, lithium with lower alkyl amines can preferably be used in the reduction step to give the desired product. The percent yield of the desired product will vary depending on the agent chosen to complete the reduction step.<br>
[0046] In certain other embodiments, the t-BuOH can be replaced by other alkyl alcohols such as secondary butyl alcohol (sec-BuOH), ethyl alcohol (EtOH).<br>
[0047] In a third step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin, a third intermediate is preferably synthesized by activation of the second intermediate with a thionyl halide, e.g., thionyl chloride. In one preferred embodiment the third intermediate synthesized is preferably a acid halide, e.g., acid chloride, having the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0048] Wherein R2is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine, imidazolides, carbodiimide and other cleaving groups such as mixed esters.<br>
[0049] In certain other preferred embodiments, oxalyl chloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride, and sulfuryl chloride may preferably be used instead of a thionyl halide.<br>
[0050] In certain other embodiments, the activation of carboxylic acid can be achieved by formation of mixed esters with isoburyl chloroformate, imidazolides, and carbodiimide.<br>
[0051] In certain other embodiments, activation can be achieved with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDO), combination of DCC and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt), a combination of EDCI and HO At or HOBt, or carbonyldiimidazole (GDI), thiocarbonylimidazole instead of thionyl halide.<br>
[0052] In a fourth step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin, the final trans capsaicin product is synthesized by acylation of a benzylamine derivative with the acid halide. In one preferred embodiment, the benzylamine derivative is 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylamine hydrochloride.<br>
[0053] In certain embodiments the 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylamine HC1 salt can be replaced by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylamine to react with the acid chloride.<br>
[0054] In certain embodiments, the acylation reaction with the acid halide is driven by aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in dimefliylformamide (DMF) and ethyl ether (Et2O).<br>
[OO55] In other preferred embodiments, alternative bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, alkyl amines such as triethylamine, Hunig's base, 4-dimemyIarninopyridine (DMAP), and pyridine can preferably be used instead of sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0056] In certain other embodiments, alternative solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (DME), acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), dicbloromethane and chloroform can preferably be used in place of dimethylformamide/ether.<br>
[0057] In certain embodiments, in a fifth and final step the final (crude) trans-capsaicin product is purified by recrystallization. Preferably, recrystallization includes purifying the trans-capsaicin product comprising the steps of: (i) dissolving the crude trans-capsaicin product in a mixture of ether/hexane and heating the mixture to about 40°C to about 45°C; ii) cooling the mixture to room temperature while stirring for about 2 hours; and iii) filtering the mixture to provide a purified trans-capsaicin product. Alternatively, the final (crude) trans capsaicin product may be purified by column chromatography using silica gel and eluting with e.g., a mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane to obtain a purified trans-capsaicin product.<br>
[0058] Additionally, or alternatively to the above-mentioned fifth and final step, the final trans-capsaicin product is purified via a semi-preparative HPLC to provide an ultra-purified trans-capsaicin having a purity of about 97% or greater, preferably about 98% or greater, more preferably about 99% or greater.<br>
[0059] La certain embodiments, the semi-preparative HPLC system is for example, an adsorption chromatography system, an ion-exchange chromatography system, a size<br>
exclusion chromatography, or the like. Preferably the HPLC system is an adsorption chromatography system such as a reverse phase chromatography system.<br>
[0060] In certain embodiments, the final purification step of the present invention includes performing the semi-preparative HPLC through the use of an isocratic elution (e.g., an isocratic mobile phase) or gradient elution (e.g., a. gradient mobile phase). In isocratic elution, the compounds (e.g., capsaicin and the impurities) are eluted using a mobile phase having a constant composition. The compounds migrate through the column at onset, with each compound migrating at a different rate, resulting in separation of the compounds. In gradient elution, the compounds may be eluted as the composition of the mobile phase changes, e.g., by increasing the concentration and/or strength of the organic solvent.<br>
[0061] Mobile phases for use in the present invention typically include for example, acetonitrile, dioxane, ethanol, isopropanol, hexane, EtOAc, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, combinations thereof, and the like. Most preferably the mobile phase comprises methanol.<br>
[0062] Semi-preparative HPLC columns for use in accordance with the present invention include for example and without limitation, Symmetry C18, Cogent HPS C18, Zorbax SB-C18 StableBond, HichromC18, Genesis 300 C18, OmniSphere C18, HxSil C18, and the like.<br>
[0063] In certain preferred embodiments, the trans-capsaicin prepared by the methods of the present invention has a purity of about 97% or greater, about 98% or greater, or 99% or greater capsaicin.<br>
[0064] In certain embodiments, the present invention is further directed to a trans-capsaicin compound having a purity of about 97% or greater, about 98% or greater, or about 99% or greater capsaicin. Such capsaicin is also referred to herein as ultra-purified capsaicin.<br>
[0065] In certain embodiments, the present invention is further directed to an ultra-purified capsaicin trans-capsaicin compound having an impurity level of about 3% or less, about 2% or less, or about 1% or less.<br>
[00661 The trans capsaicin prepared by the methods of the present invention is preferably suitable for the preparation of an injectable or infiltratable composition which can be administered to a discrete site in a human or animal for the treatment of pain.<br>
[0067] As used herein, the terms "trans capsaicin" and "trans capsaicin-like compounds" include trans isomers of capsaicin and capsaicin-like compounds that act at the same pharmacologic sites, e.g., vanilloid receptor subtype-1, as capsaicin, unless otherwise specified. Capsaicin-like compounds with similar physiological properties, i.e., triggering C fiber membrane depolarization by opening of cation channels permeable to calcium and sodium, are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,446 issued to Brand (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.) on March 14,1989 describes other capsaicin-like compounds and methods for their preparation. U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,205 issued to LaHann on January 3,1984 cites capsaicin-like analogues. Ton et al., Brit. J. Pharm. 10:175-182 (1955) discusses the pharmacological actions of capsaicin and its analogues.<br>
[0068] Where a trans capsaicin-like compound is synthesized by the methods of the present invention, the trans capsaicin-like compound will preferably provide similar physiological properties to trans capsaicin as are known in the art<br>
[0069] Suitable trans capsaicin-like compounds preferably include, but are not limited to homocapsaicin, eugenol, curcumin, anandamide, piperine, piperyline, piperettine, piperolein A, piperolein B, piperanine and any combinations or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0070] The trans capsaicin and trans capsaicin-like compounds synthesized by the methods of the present invention are especially useful for treating disorders or pain that can be alleviated through activation of the vanilloid receptors as trans isomers are recognized mediators of the VR-1 mechanism. The synthetic method of the invention results in a capsaicin product which consists essentially of trans-capsaicin. The capsaicin product prepared in accordance with the invention contains less than 1% cis-capsaicin.<br>
[0071] A vanilloid moiety constitutes an essential structural component of trans capsaicin and trans capsaicin-like compounds, therefore, the proposed site of action of these trans compounds has been more generally referred to as the vanilloid receptor(Szallasi 1994 Gen. Pharmac. 25:223-243). In contrast, while the cis-isomer of capsaicin has activity via a number of mechanisms, VR-1 is not considered to comprise a major effect of that agent.<br>
[0072] VR-1 is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel that is activated by vanilloids, e.g., capsaicin and resiniferatoxin. The human vanilloid receptor when expressed in mammalian cells is activated by capsaicin, temperatures greater than 42°C and by pH less than 5.5. The activation by all these effectors can be blocked substantially or completely by the action of the capsaicin antagonist capsazepine.<br>
[0073] VR-1 is found along the entire length of primary sensory neurons with somata I dorsal -root and trigeminal ganglia. These neurons are of small to medium diameter and give rise to unmyelinated C-fibers. VR-1 positive neurons with C-fibers can be divided into two subdivisions: peptidergic and nonpeptidergic. Among the neuropeptides found in vanilloid-sensitive neurons, substance P and CGRP are the best characterized. Nonpeptidergic vanilloid sensitive neurons characteristically possess the P2X3 purinoceptor and cross-desensitization between purinoceptors and vanilloid receptors. A subset of nodose ganglion neurons also contain VR-1. VR-1 is believed to function as a shared receptor for various noxious stimuli, including heat, acids and some plant toxins. In addition, during inflammation, endogenous substances released from activated immune cells might also target VR-1, whose activation, apart from nociception, also leads to CGRP-mediated local vasodilation. In the gastrointestinal tract, this mechanism is believed to have a central role in mucousal protection. By contrast, the role of VR-1 in the central terminals of primary neurons, i.e., the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the endogenous activators of this receptor are unknown.<br>
[0074] Vanilloids such as trans-capsaicin, have a biphasic action on sensitive peripheral nerves, an initial excitatory phase (manifested as pain and/or neurogenic inflammation) followed by a lasting refractory state, traditionally known as desensitization (Szallasi 2000 Trends Neurosci. 25:491-497).<br>

Step 1; Alleviation of 3-methyl-butyne with Bromovaleric acid<br>
[0089] The first step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin involves the synthesis of a first intermediate, e.g., (8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid) by alkylation of 3-methyl-butyne with a halovaleric acid, e.g., bromovaleric acid. A first intermediate composition was successfully synthesized in the laboratory by Examples I(a)-(e) as follows:<br>
Example If at<br>
[0090] 8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid was prepared under two separate reactions (reaction 1 and reaction 2) by adding anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (15ml) and hexamethylphosphoramide (3.8ml) to a 50ml 3-necked KB flask equipped with a thermometer, a magnetic stirrer and nitrogen in/outlet. The mixture was cooled to about -78°C to about -75°C. Methyl-butyne (1g) was then added followed by dropwise addition of 2.5M n-BuLi (Rxn 1= 1 equiv. and Rxn 2= 2 equiv.) at a temperature from about -78°C to about -65°C. The mixtures in both reactions were gradually warmed up to about -30°C and stirred at this temperature for about 30 minutes. A solution of 5-bromovaleric acid (1.33g in 3ml of THF) was added dropwise at about -30°C for about 10 to about 15<br>
minutes. The mixtures of reaction 1 and reaction 2 were then gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight.<br>
[0091] The reaction mixtures (rxn 1 and 2) were then warmed up. Approximately 50ml of 3M HC1 was added to both the solution of reaction 1 and the solution of reaction 2. The solutions were then extracted with ethyl acetate (2x100 ml) and washed with brine. The extraction yielded about 1.1 g of crude product from reaction 1 and about 0.8g of crude product from reaction 2.<br>
[0092] The crude product from reaction 1 was purified by column chromatography using about 50g of silica gel and eluted with a 2:1 mixture of hexane/ethyl acetate. The collections were combined. Solvents were removed under vacuum to give a step 1 intermediate product (8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid). The intermediate product produced was a light yellow oil. The amount of intermediate produced weighed about 0.55g (yield =46%).<br>
Example I(b)<br>
[0093] 8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid was prepared by adding hexamethylphosphorarnide (30ml) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (120ml) under nitrogen to a 500ml 3-necked BR flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an additional funnel and a thermometer.

The mixture was then warmed to -30°C while stirring for about 45 minutes. A solution of bromovaleric acid (10.4g in approximately 20 ml anhydrous THF) was added dropwise at about -30°C to about 25°C for about 20 minutes. The mixture was then gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. A TLC of the reaction mixture showed no starting material present.<br>
[0094] 3M HC1 (100ml) and water (100ml) were added to the mixture. The temperature was increased to about 3°C. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 X 200ml). The extractions were combined and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvents were removed under vacuum at approximately 35°C to give a crude step 1 end product that was a light orange/yellow oil. The crude end product was purified by column chromatography using<br>
silica gel (approx. 250g) and eluted with a 1:2 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane. The collections were combined and solvents were removed under vacuum to produce the step 2 intermediate as a light yellow oil. The weight was about 6.7 g (71% yield).<br>

The solution was cooled to -70°C. 3-methyl-butyne was added 15.7gm (23.6ml) to the solution. Next, 2.5M n-BuLi (92ml) was added dropwise at a temperature less than about -50°C for 25 minutes. The solution was gradually warmed to -30°C and stirred for 50 minutes. A solution of 5-bromovaleric acid (20.8g) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40ml) was added dropwise at a temperature of about -30°C to about -25°C for about 30 minutes. The solution was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. A TLC of the reaction mixture indicated a cleaner reaction.<br>
[0096] The reaction mixture was cooled to 5°C to 10°C. 3M HC1 (100ml) and water (150ml) were added to the solution. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 X 200ml). TLC of the ethyl acetate extraction showed that two ethyl acetate extractions were enough. The two ethyl acetate extractions were combined, washed with brine (350ml), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. The solvents were removed under vacuum to give about 25.8g of intermediate product.<br>
[0097] The crude intermediate product was purified by column chromatography using about 300g of silica gel eluted with a 1:2 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane.<br>

This mixture was cooled to - 70°C. 3-Methyl-1-buryne (15.6 g) was then added followed by dropwise addition of n-BuLi (92 ml) at an internal temperature of less than -50°C, The mixture was then gradually wanned to - 30°C over a period of 1 hr. A solution of 5-bromovaleric acid (20.7g) in tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) was the added while maintaining the internal temperature below -30°C. The reaction mixture was warmed up to room temperature gradually and stirred<br>
overnight. A TLC of the reaction mixture at this stage showed consumption of all of the bromovaleric acid and the reaction was worked up.<br>
[0103] The reaction mixture was cooled to 5-10°C and then 3M HC1 (100 ml) and water (150 ml) were added so that the internal temperature did not rise above 15°C. The solution was then extracted with ethyl acetate (2x200 ml) and the organic layer dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to give a crude step 1 intermediate product. The crude intermediate product was purified by flash chromatography using 10:1 silica gel to the substrate and eluted with a 1:2 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane. Product fractions were combined and concentrated to provide the step 1 intermediate product (8-methyl-6-nonynoic acid) which was then dried under vacuum to constant weight. The intermediate product produced was a light yellow oil. The amount of intermediate produced weighed 15 g (yield =89%).

[0130] 8-Methyl-6-nonynoic acid (225g), anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2.7 L, inhibitor free) and t-BuOH (154 ml) were added under argon to a 22L 4-necked RB flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer. The mixture was cooled to about -55°C to about -45 °C. Ammonia (approx. 4 L) was condensed to the flask. Lithium (approx. 30-35g) was added portionwise at a temperature no greater than -33°C and stirred for no less than 30 minutes while maintaining a dark blue color. NH4C1 (143 g) was added portionwise. The resulting mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and the ammonia evaporated.<br>
[0131] Ice-water (3 L) was added portionwise. The resulting mixture was acidified using 6N HC1 to pH 
[0132] The crude product was purified by Biotage column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane 1:3) to give 214 g (94%) of product as a pale yellow oil. Gas chromatography confirmed a trans/cis (E/Z) ratio of about 94:3 to about 94:5.<br>
Step 3; Activation of 8-methvl-6-nonenoic acid<br>
[0133] The third step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin involves the synthesis of a third intermediate (an acid halide) by activation of 8-methyl-6-nonenoic acid. 8-Methyl-6-nonenoic acid was successfully converted to acid chloride in the laboratory by Examples III(a)-(c) as follows:<br>
Example III(a)<br>
[0134] 8-Methyl-6-nonenoic acid was added to a 50ml 3-necked RB flask equipped with a condenser, an additional funnel, a thermometer and a magnetic stirrer. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) 3.9ml was added dropwise at room temperature for about 25 minutes. The solution was then heated with a water bath at about 50°C to about 60°C for about 1 hour.<br>
Excess thionyl chloride was removed under vacuum at about 40°C to about 45°C to yield about 3g of a third intermediate product (acid chloride; a light brownish yellow oil),<br>
Example III(b)<br>
[0135] 8-Methyl-6-nonenoic acid (12g) was added to a 100ml 3-necked RB flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, an additional runnel, a condenser and a thermometer. Thionyl chloride (15.5ml) was added dropwise at room temperature under nitrogen for 30 minutes. The solution was then heated for about 1 hour to bring the temperature form about 50°C to about 65°C or about 74°C which produce a brown solution. The excess thionyl chloride was removed under vacuum at about 40°C to about 42°C to give about 13.4 g of a brown oil. The intermediate product was then dried under vacuum at 40°C for 1 hour.<br>
Example III (c)<br>
[0136] 8-Methyl-6-nonenoic acid (12g) was added to a 100 ml 3-necked RB flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, additional funnel, condenser and thermometer. Thionyl chloride (25.2g) was then added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then heated to 65-74°C over a period of 1 hr. Excess thionyl chloride was removed under vacuum and crude acid chloride product was produced. The crude acid chloride product was then used in a fourth synthesis step without further purification to produce trans capsaicin.<br>
Example III(d)<br>
[0137] 8-Methyl-6-nonenoic acid (200g) was treated with thionyl chloride (419 g). The reaction mixture was then heated at about 70°C for about 1 hr. Excess thionyl chloride was removed under vacuum to produce 249 g of a crude product. The crude acid chloride was then used in a fourth synthesis step without further purification.<br>
Step 4; Coupling of benzylamine derivative to the acid halide<br>
[0138] The fourth step in the synthesis of trans capsaicin involves the synthesis of the tans capsaicin end product by coupling of a benzylamine derivative to the acid halide. The benzylamine derivative was successfully coupled to the acid halide in the laboratory by Examples III(a)-(c) as follows:<br>
Example IV( a)<br>
[0139] 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylamine HC1 salt (3.35g) and dimethylformamide (10ml) were added to a 100ml 3-necked KB flask equipped with an additional runnel, a thermometer and a magnetic stirrer under nitrogen. 5N NaOH (7 ml) was added portion-wise at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at 35°C for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to about 0°C to about 5°C. Acid chloride (produced in step 3) in anhydrous ether (30ml) was added dropwise at about 0°C to about 5°C or 10°C for about 20 minutes. An additional 5ml of anhydrous dimethylformamide was added. The mixture was gradually wanned to room temperature and stirred under nitrogen overnight.<br>
[0140] Water (150ml) was added. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (1X 100ml and 1 x 50ml). The ethyl acetate extract was washed with IN HC3 (2 X 60ml) followed by saturated NaHCOs (2 x 100ml) and brine. The extract was then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed under vacuum at about 35°C to about 40°C to give a thick light orange/pink residue (wt, = 3.4g).<br>
[0141J The crude product was purified by column chromatography using from about 150 to about 160g of silica gel eluted with a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane.<br>
[0142] Collections from the column purification were combined, concentrated under vacuum at about 40°C and dried under vacuum to produce 3.1 g of the desired product as a white solid.<br><br>
Example IV(b)<br>
[0143] 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylammehydrochloride (13.4g) and dimethylformamide (40ml) were added under nitrogen to a 500ml 3-necked KB flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an additional funnel and a thermometer. The mixture was cooled to about 10°C. 5N NaOH (28ml) was added portion wise with an ice-water bath. The solution was stirred at about 20°C for 30 minutes men cooled to 5°C. Acid chloride in anhydrous ether (120ml) was added dropwise at 5°C for about 1 hour (temperature increased to about 7°C). The solution was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight<br>
[0144] Water (400ml) was added and the resulting mixture then extracted with ethyl acetate (1 x 400ml and 2 x 200ml). A TLC of the extraction revealed two ethyl acetate extractions were enough. The ethyl acetate extracts were washed with IN HC1 (2 x 200ml and 1 x 100ml). The organic layers were then washed with NaHCO3 (2 x 200ml and 200ml), brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed under vacuum and the residue co-evaporated with ether (x2) to produce about 21g of crude product as a light brown sticky residue. The residue was dried overnight under vacuum (wt. = 20.2g).<br>
[0145] The product was purified by column chromatography using about 600g of silica gel eluted with: i) a 2:3 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (2L); ii) a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (3L) and iii) a 3:2 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (3L) to obtain a crude compound.<br>
[0146] The collections were combined and solvents were removed under vacuum at about 40°C. The product was co-evaporated with ether (x2) and dried under vacuum overnight to give the desired product as a white solid (wt.= 14.1 g, 65% yield). HPLC 96% pure.<br>
[0147] Overlap collections were also combined and solvents removed under vacuum to 2.4 g of less pure product. An ester by-product (1.4 g) was also separated and characterized,<br>
[0148] In additional embodiments of the present invention, purification of the crude product after addition of NaHCO3, by treatment with 2N NaOH was tested on a test tube scale. The salt produced was found to be soluble in ethyl acetate. Furthermore, it was found preferable to control the reaction temperature (approx. 5-100C) when adding the acid chloride to the reaction mixture.<br>
Esample IV (c)<br>
[0149] 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylaminehydrochloride (13.4 g) and dimewylformamide (40 ml) were added to a 500 ml 3-necked RB flask equipped with a mechanical steer, additional funnel and thermometer under nitrogen. The solution was then cooled to 10°C and 5N sodium hydroxide 28 ml was added dropwise so that the internal temperature was kept below 20°C. The solution was stirred for 30 min at 20°C and then cooled to 5°C. Once cooled, a solution of acid chloride (13.3 g) in ether (120 ml) was added over a period of 1 hr while maintaining the internal temperature at 3-7°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred over 12 hrs at 20°C.<br>
[0150] The reaction mixture was washed with water (400 ml) and ethyl acetate (2 X 200 ml). The combined organics were washed with 1N HC1 (2 X 200 ml), saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 X 200 ml) and saturated sodium chloride (200 ml) and then dried over sodium sulfate. Solvent was removed under vacuum and a pink solid was produced and purified by flash chromatography using silica gel and an ethyl acetate/hexane mixture (2:3 to 3:2). Pure fractions were combined and weighed 14.1 g, corresponding to a yield of 65% (HPLC = 96% area % purity).<br>
[0151] In certain other embodiments, flash chromatography can preferably be avoided in this fourth step since the crude was processed directly to crystallization, which yielded the product in good purity and recovery.<br>
[0152] The trans capsaicin obtained by the methods described above was recrystallized using ether/hexane (1:2,150 ml) at 40-45°C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature over a period of 2 hrs.  The white precipitate was filtered and dried to constant weight (weight = 12.7 g (Yield = 91%)). The spectral data for the trans capsaicin product was as follows: 1HNMR (CDC13) δ 6.86-6.75 (m, 3H), 5.82 (hr s, 2H), 5.35-5.32<br>
(m, 2H), 4.34-4.32 (d, 2H), 3.86 (s, 3H), 2.22-2.17 (m, 3H), 2.00-1.95 (m, 2H), 1.75-1.65 (m, 2H), 1.45-1.35 (m, 2H), 0.95 (d, 6H); MS - 306 (M+l). Anal. Cald. For C18H27NO3; C, 70.79; H, 8.91; N, 4.59; Found: C, 70.94, H, 8.94; N, 4.75.<br>
[0153] The HPLC Purity (area%) of the synthesized trans capsaicin was 98%.<br>
Example IV(d)<br>
[0154] 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylamine hydrochloride (245 g) and dimethylformamide (700 ml) were added to a 12 L 4-necked RB flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, additional funnel and thermometer under argon. The suspension was then cooled to 10°C and 5N sodium hydroxide (494 ml) was added dropwise at temperature below 20°C. The solution was cooled to about 10°C and stirred for 30 min and then cooled to about 5°C. A solution of acid chloride (249 g) in ether (1.7 L) was added dropwise at about 5°C. The reaction mixture was gradually wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight.<br>
[0155] The reaction mixture was partitioned between 1N HC1 (5L) and ethyl acetate (5L). The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (5L). The organic layers were combined, washed with 1N HC1 (5L), saturated sodium bicarbonate (3x5L) and brine (5L) and then dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Solvent was removed under vacuum to produce a crude product. The crude product was purified by two recrystallization from ether/hexane (1:2) to give 237 g (66% yield) of the desired product. HPLC confirmed a ratio of trans/cis (E/Z) of about 98:0.9<br>
Purification of Capsaicin by Re-crystallization Example V(a)<br>
[0156] Crude capsaicin (Ig; HPLC 91%) was dissolved in a 1:2 mixture of ether/hexane (15ml). The mixture was heated to about 40°C to about 42°C to dissolve the solid. The mixture was gradually cooled to room temperature while stirring. Off-white particles were produced. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for about 2 hours. The solids were filtered to give off-white solids (wt.=0.74g).<br>
Example V(b)<br>
[0157] Capsaicin (14g) was dissolved in a 1:2 mixture of ether/hexane (150ml) at about 40°C to about 45°C. The solution was gradually cooled to room temperature. A white precipitate formed.

By evaluating chromatogram of the crude capsaicin, it was found nordihydro capsaicin was the major impurity although some trace amount of late eluting impurities were also observed. As nordihydro-capsaicin and capsaicin both elute no earlier than 60 minutes, an overlapping injection approach was made to reduce the purification cycle time to 45 minutes, thus reducing solvent assumption as well.<br>
During the course of purification, fractions were collected and analyzed by analytical HPLC to make sure the purity is above 99.0%, All purified fractions were pooled and dried via rotary evaporation at 55-60 °C.<br>
The purification method was demonstrated to be successful. 9.85grams of capsaicin was processed with final purity greater than 99.9%. The overall recovery of the purification was 80%.<br><br>
(Table Removed)Example VH Comparative Example<br>
[0161] Initially, a four-step process was proposed for the synthesis of trans-capsaicin, which included: a) formation of a dianion; b) alkylation of the dianion; c) reduction of the dianion; and d) coupling to a benzylamine derivative to obtain trans-capsaicin. The four-step process is as follows:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) [0162] In the first test, alkylation of the 6-heptynoic acid was attempted first using a 2-iodopropane as the alkylating reagent and LDA, NaH and LiNH2 as the bases to form the alkene anion. Only starting 6-heptynioc acid was recovered. These results suggested that elimination of HI from isopropyl iodide (E2) was exclusive instead of the desired nucleophilic substitution to form the desired isopropyl alkyne.<br>
[0163] Alkylation of 6-heptynoic acid was further tested using 2-bromopropane and isopropyl mesylate as the alkylating reagent and NaH and n-BuLi/AlCl3 as the bases. No desired product was observed under these conditions.<br>
[0164] In further alkylation tests, dianion formation was tested. In particular, 6-heptynoic acid (2g) was treated with LDA (3 equiv.) under conditions similar to those used for the previous isopropyl halide reactions. The reaction mixture was then treated with benzyl bromide. Product formation was confirmed.<br><br>
[0165] In yet another approach, orthoester protection of the carboxylic acid group of 6-heptynoic acid followed by alkylation of the alkyne function was tested. Alkylation with benzyl bromide was tested as a model reaction using 300mg of the orthoester of 6-heptynoic acid using n-BuLi and ethyl magnesium chloride as a base, respectively.<br>
[0166] The use of n-BuLi base produced product/starting compound in a ratio of 7:2. Use of ethyl magnesium chloride produced a small amount of product having a product to starting material ratio of 1:2.<br>
[0167] In another test, Grignard, Samarium-Mediated alkylation was tested by alkylation of the orthoester with isopropyl iodide on a 300mg scale using samarium iodide-samarium (Smla) and ethyl magnesium bromide, respectively. No product formation was observed from either reaction.<br>
[0168] In another test, trans-8-methyl-6-nonenoic acid was synthesized through a Wittig reaction followed by isomerization. Crude capsaicin was (1.4 g thick oil, approx, 84% trans and 12% cis isomer) was purified by crystallization from ether/hexane (1:3) to give 0.4g of an off-white solid. 91.5% purity was shown by HPLC with a trans/cis ratio of 91.5/6.7. The cis isomer appeared less crystalline and a mixture (0.3g) was obtained from sticky residue.<br>
[0169] La another test, alkylation of the orthoester of 6-heptynoic acid with isopropyl bromide under Grignard conditions was tested, but no desired product was produced.<br>
