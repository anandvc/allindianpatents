	This invention relates to a liquid composition, in<br>
particular to a liquid detergent composition, comprising an enzyme and an improved enzyme stabilizer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Storage  stability problems  are  well  known with<br>
liquids containing enzyme(s). Especially in enzyme-containing<br>
liquid detergents a major problem,  in particular if the<br>
detergent  contains  protease,  is  that  of  ensuring  enzyme<br>
 activity over time.<br>
The prior art has dealt extensively with improving the storage stability, for example by adding a protease inhibitor.<br>
Boric acid and boronic acids are known to reversibly  inhibit proteolytic enzymes. A discussion of the inhibition of one serine protease, subtilisin, by boronic acid is provided in Molecular &amp; Cellular Biochemistry 51, 1983, pp. 5-32.<br>
Boronic acids have very different capacities as subtilisin inhibitors. Boronic acids containing only alkyl  groups such as methyl, butyl or 2-cyclohexylethyl are poor inhibitors with methylboronic acid as the poorest inhibitor, whereas boronic acids bearing aromatic groups such as phenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl or 3,5-dichlorophenyl are good inhibitors with 3,5-dichlorophenylboronic acid as a particularly effective one  {see Keller et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 176, 1991, pp. 401-405).<br>
It is also claimed that aryl boronic acids which have a substitution at the 3-position relative to boron are unexpectedly good reversible protease inhibitors. Especially,<br><br>
acetamidophenyl boronic acid is claimed to be a superior inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes (see WO 92/19707).<br>
The inhibition constant (Ki) is ordinarily used as a measure of capacity to inhibit enzyme activity, with a low K^ indicating a more potent inhibitor. However, it has earlier been found that the Ki values of boronic acids do not always tell how effective inhibitors are (see for instance WO 92/19707).<br>
	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this invention it is surprisingly found that phenyl boronic acid derivatives substituted in the para-position with a &gt;C=0 adjacent to the phenyl boronic acid have  extraordinary  good  capacities  as  enzyme  stabilizers  in liquids.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a liquid composition comprising an enzyme and a phenyl boronic acid derivative enzyme stabilizer of the following formula:<br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen,  hydroxy, C1-C6 alkyl, substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkenyl and substituted C1-C6 alkenyl.<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
 One embodiment of the present invention provides a liquid composition comprising an enzyme and a phenyl boronic acid derivative enzyme stabilizer of the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, C1-C6 alkyl, substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkenyl and<br>
substituted C1-C6 alkenyl.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
provides a liquid composition comprising an enzyme and a<br>
phenyl boronic  acid derivative  enzyme  stabilizer  of  the  formula disclosed above,  wherein R is a C1-C6 al^yl,  in<br>
particular wherein R is CH3, CH3CH2 or CH3CH2CH2, or wherein R<br>
is hydrogen.<br>
A  further  preferred  embodiment  of  the  present<br>
invention provides a liquid detergent composition comprising a  surfactant, an enzyme and a phenyl boronic acid derivative<br>
enzyme stabilizer of the formula disclosed above.<br>
Preparation of Phenyl Boronic Acid Derivatives<br>
Phenyl boronic acid derivatives may be prepared<br>
 using methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example by using a Grignard preparation:<br>
The Grignard reagent is prepared by the slow dropwise addition of the appropriate bromobenzene starting material in anhydrous ether to magnesium turnings in anhydrous ether. The anhydrous ether may be, e.g., sodium dried diethylether or sodium dried tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is encouraged by the addition of a small iodine crystal.<br>
Trimethylborate or tri-n-butylborate in anhydrous ether  (e.g.  sodium  dried  diethylether  or  sodium  dried<br>
 tetrahydrofuran) is cooled to about -70°C and the Grignard reagent is added dropwise over a period of approximately 2 hours while keeping the borate solution at about -70C and continuously agitating.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature overnight whereupon it is hydrolysed by the dropwise addition of cold dilute sulphuric acid. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted with ether.  The ether containing fractions are combined and the solvent removed. The residue is made distinctly alkaline and any methanol or butanol so formed is removed. The alkaline solution is made acidic and cooled and the resulting crystals of  desired boronic  acid  are  removed by  filtration.  All<br>
 products are preferably recrystallized from distilled water or some other appropriate solvent.<br>
Preparation of, e.g., 4-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid, using the method disclosed above, has been described in Chem. Ber. 123, 1990, pp. 1841-1843.<br>
	The phenyl boronic acids may also be prepared using<br>
either direct lithiation of the benzene and/or lithiation of the bromide.<br>
Any nuclear substitution or protection of functional groups may be achieved by using standard methods well known to<br>
 those skilled in the art.<br>
Stabilizers<br>
According to the invention the liquid composition may contain up to 500 mM of the stabilizer (the phenyl boronic<br>
 acid derivative), preferably the detergent composition may contain 0.001-250 mM of the stabilizer, more preferably the liquid composition may contain 0.005-100 mM of the stabilizer, most preferably the liquid composition may contain 0.01-10 mM of the stabilizer.

Detergents<br>
According to the invention the liquid detergent composition will beside enzyme(s) and stabilizer comprise a surfactant. The detergent composition may, e.g., be a laundry detergent composition or a dishwashing detergent composition.<br>
The detergent may be aqueous, typically containing up to 70 % water and 0-30 % organic solvent, or nonaqueous.<br>
The detergent composition comprises one or more surfactants, each of which may be anionic, nonionic, c^tionic,<br>
 or amphoteric (zwitterionic). The detergent will usually contain 0-50% of anionic surfactant such as linear alkylben-zenesulfonate (LAS), alpha-olefinsulfonate (AOS), alkyl sulfate (fatty alcohol sulfate) (AS), alcohol ethoxysulfate (AEOS or AES), secondary alkanesulfonates (SAS), alpha-sulfo<br>
 fatty acid methyl esters, alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, or soap.' It may also contain 0-40% of nonionic surfactant such as alcohol ethoxylate (AEO or AE), alcohol propoxylate, carboxylated alcohol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylate, alkylpolyglycoside,   alkyldimethylamine  oxide,   ethoxylated<br>
 fatty acid monoethanolamide, fatty acid monoethanolaraide, or polyhydroxy alkyl fatty acid amide (e.g. as described in WO 92/06154).<br>
Normally the detergent contains 1-65% of a detergent builder, but some dishwashing detergents may contain even up<br>
 to 90% of a detergent builder, or complexing agent such as zeolite, diphosphate, triphosphate, phosphonate, citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTMPA), alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, soluble silicates or layered silicates<br>
 (e.g. SKS-6 from Hoechst) .<br>
The detergent builders may be subdivided into phosphorus-containing and non-phosphorous-containing types. Examples of phosphorus-containing inorganic alkaline detergent builders include the water-soluble salts, especially alkali<br>
metal  pyrophosphates,  orthophosphates,  polyphosphates  and<br><br>
phosphonates. Examples of non-phosphorus-containing inorganic builders include water-soluble alkali metal carbonates, borates and silicates as well as layered disilicates and the various types of water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous alumino silicates of which zeolites is the best known representative.<br>
Examples of suitable organic builders include alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium salts of succinates, malonates, fatty acid malonates, fatty acid sulphonates, carboxymethoxy succinates, polyacetates, carboxylates, polycarboxylates, aminopolycarboxylates and polyacetyl carboxylates. The detergent may also be unbuilt, i.e. essentially free of detergent builder.<br>
The detergent may comprise one or more polymers. Examples are carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP), polyethyleneglycol (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polycarboxylates such as polyacrylates, polymaleates, maleic/acrylic acid copolymers and lauryl methacryiate/acrylic acid copolymers.<br>
The detergent composition may contain bleaching agents of the chlorine/bromine-type or the oxygen-type. The bleaching agents may be coated or encapsulated. Examples of inorganic chlorine/bromine-type bleaches are lithium, sodium or calcium hypochlorite or hypobromite as well as chlorinated trisodium phosphate. The bleaching system may also comprise a H2O2 source such as perborate or percarbonate which_ may be combined with a peracid-forming bleach activator such as tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) or nonanoyloxybenzene-sulfonate (NOBS).<br>
Examples of organic chlorine/bromine-type bleaches are heterocyclic N-bromo and N-chloro imides such as trichloroisocyanuric, tribromoisocyanuric, dibromoisocyanuric and dichloroisocyanuric acids, and salts thereof with water solubilizing cations such as potassium and sodium. Hydantoin compounds are also suitable. The bleaching system mav also<br><br>
comprise peroxyacids of, e.g., the amide, imide, or sulfone type.<br>
In dishwashing detergents the oxygen bleaches are preferred, for example in the form of an inorganic persalt, preferably with a bleach precursor or as a peroxy acid com¬pound. Typical examples of suitable peroxy bleach compounds are alkali metal perborates, both tetrahydrates and monohydrates, alkali metal percarbonates, persilicates and perphosphates. Preferred activator materials are TAED or NOBS.<br>
The enzyme(s) of the detergent composition- of the invention may additionally be stabilized using conventional stabilizing agents, e.g., a polyol such as propylene glycol or glycerol, a sugar or sugar alcohol, or lactic acid.<br>
The detergent may also contain other conventional detergent ingredients such as, e.g., fabric conditioners in¬cluding clays, deflocculant material, foam boosters/foam depressors (in dishwashing detergents foam depressors), suds suppressors, anti-corrosion agents, soil-suspending agents, anti-soil-redeposition agents, dyes, dehydrating agents, bactericides, optical brighteners, or perfume.<br>
The pH (measured in aqueous solution at use con¬centration) will usually be neutral or alkaline, e.g. in the range of 7-11.<br>
Particular forms of laundry detergent compositions within the scope of the invention include:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
5)	Detergent formulations as described in 1) - 4) wherein all<br>
or part of the linear alkylbenzenesulfonate is replaced' by<br>
(C12-C18) alkyl sulfate.<br>
6)	Detergent formulations as described in 1) - 5) which<br>
contain a stabilized or encapsulated peracid, either as an<br>
additional component or as a substitute for already specified<br>
bleach systems.<br>
7)	Detergent composition formulated as a nonaqueous detergent<br>
liquid comprising a liquid nonionic surfactant such as, e.g.,<br>
linear alkoxylated primary alcohol, a builder system (e.g.<br>
phosphate), enzyme and alkali. The detergent may also comprise<br>
anionic surfactant and/or a bleach system.<br>
Particular forms of dishwashing detergent composi¬tions within the scope of the invention include:<br>
1) LIQUID DISHWASHING COMPOSITION WITH CLEANING SURFACTANT SYSTEM<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
7)	Automatic dishwashing compositions as described in 1) and<br>
5), wherein perborate is replaced by percarbonate.<br>
8)	Automatic dishwashing compositions as described in 1),<br>
which additionally contain a manganese catalyst. The manganese<br><br>
catalyst may, e.g., be one of the compounds described in "Efficient manganese catalysts for low-temperature bleaching", Nature 369, 1994, pp. 637-639.<br>
Tests of Stabilizers<br>
According to the invention the effectiveness of each stabilizer may be tested in one or more of the following tests:<br>
a) Storage Stability Test in Liquid Detergent: Enzyme(s) and stabilizer are added to a liquid detergent formulation and stored at well de-fined conditions. The enzyme activity of each enzyme is determined as a function of time, e.g. after 0, 3, 7 and 14 days.<br>
To calculate the inhibition efficiency from the storage stability date a reaction mechanism is proposed. The following reactions give a relatively simple, but yet plaus¬ible, mechanism for a liquid detergent containing protease (P), lipase (L), and inhibitor (I):<br>
I)	Autodigestion of protease:<br>
P + P -&gt; Dp + P<br>
II)	Denaturation of protease:<br>
P -&gt; Dp<br>
III)	Inhibition of protease:<br>
P + I 
IV)	Protease digestion of inhibited enzyme:<br>
P + PI-&gt;P + Dp + I<br>
V)	Denaturation of inhibited enzyme:<br>
PI -&gt; Dp + I<br><br>
VI)	Protease digestion of lipase:<br>
P + L -&gt; P + DL<br>
VII)	Denaturation of lipase:<br>
L ^ DL<br>
where Dp and DL are denatured (i.e. non-active) protease and lipase.<br>
From these reactions three coupled differential equations are derived describing the deactivation of P, L and PI. The reaction rate constants are derived from storage stability data by the use of a parameter estimation method (Gauss-Newton with the Levenberg modification). The storage stability data give the concentration of (P+PI) and L as a function of time.<br>
Reaction III is much faster than the other reactions and equilibrium is assumed in the calculations. Reaction IV is excluded from the system to reduce the number of parameters thereby describing the stability of the inhibited enzyme by only one reaction rate constant (from equation V).<br>
In all experiments there is a large surplus of inhibitor molecules compared to protease molecules, i.e. a constant concentration of inhibitor (corresponding to the added amount of inhibitor) is a reasonable assumption.<br>
The specific values of the reaction rate constants<br>
are somewhat sensitive to small variations in the data, but<br>
the sensitivity is reduced significantly by giving the results<br>
relatively to the value from Boric Acid. An improvement factor<br>
is thus derived:	•<br>
Ki (Boric Acid)<br>
IFi =  	<br>
Ki (Inhibitor)<br>
IFi measures the inhibition efficiency given by the inhibition constants Ki from' reaction III.<br><br>
b) Determination of Ki. The inhibition constant K| may be determined by using standard methods, for reference see Keller et al, Biochem, Biophys, Res. Com. 176, 1991, pp.401-405; J.Bieth in Bayer-Symposium "Proteinase Inhibitors", pp. 463-469,Springer-Verlag, 1974 and Lone Kierstein Hansen in "Dertermination of Specific Activities of Selected Detergent Proteases using Protease Activity, Molecular Weights, Kinetic Parameters and Inhibition Kinetics", PhD-report, Novo Nordisk A/S and University of Copenhagen, 1991.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a liquid composition comprising a protease and a phenyl boronic acid derivative enzyme stabilizer of the following formula:<br><br>
where R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, C1-C6, alkyl substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkenyl and substituted C1-C6 alkenyl.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following examples which are not intended to be in any way limiting to the scope of the invention as claimed.<br>
Example I Preparation of 4-Formyl-Phenyl-Boronic Acid<br><br>
4-Formyl-phenyI-boronic acid may be prepared as disclosed in Chem.Ber.l23,1990,pp. 1841-1843, or it may be bought at Lancaster synthesis GmbH (4-Formylbenzeneboronic acid).<br>

The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was deter¬mined at nine substrate concentrations in the range of 0.01 to 2 mM using a Cobas Fara automated spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters V^^x   and Km were determined using ENZFITTER<br>
(a non-linear regression data analysis program).<br>
kcat was calculated from the equation V^ax = kcat X<br>
[Eo]. The concentration of active enzyme [EQ] was determined by active site titration using tight-binding protein proteinase inhibitors. The inhibition constant Ki was calculated from plots of Km/kcat as a function of the concentration of inhibitor. The inhibitors were assumed to be 100% pure and the molar concentrations were determined using weighing numbers and molecular weights.<br>
The results of the inhibition constants Ki of the phenyl boronic acid derivative enzyme stabilizers tested are listed below:<br>
Inhibitor:	Ki (Savinase):<br>
3oric acid	20  mM<br>
i-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid        0.3 mM<br>
For comparison reasons acetamidophenyl boronic acid was also tested in the same system giving the following results:<br>
Inhibitor:	Ki (Savinase):<br>
Boric acid	20 mM<br>
acetamidophenyl boronic acid        1 mM<br><br>
It appears from the results given above that the inhibiting properties of 4-formyl-phenyl boronic acid is at least three times better than those of acetamidophenyl boronic acid.<br>

The results of the inhibition effectiveness IFi of the phenyl boronic acid enzyme stabilizers tested are listed below:<br>
Inhibitor:	Improvement Factor<br>
IFi<br>
Boric acid	1<br>
4-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid        1000<br>
For comparison reasons acetamidophenyl boronic acid, 2-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid and 3-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid (all bought at Lancaster) were tested in the same system giving the following results:<br>
Inhibitor:	Improvement Factor<br>
IFI<br>
Boric acid	1<br>
acetamidophenyl boronic	acid	300<br>
i 2-formyl-phenyl-boronic	acid	36<br>
3-formyl-phenyl-boronic	acid	230<br>
It appears from the results given above that the storage stability properties of 4-formyl-phenyl boronic acid is at least three times better than those of acetamidophenyl boronic acid, and at least four times better than those of 3-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid, and at least 25 times better than those of 2-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid (all calculated on molar basis).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Storage Stability Test in a Commercial Detergent<br>
The inhibition effectiveness IFi of 4-formyl-phenyl-boronic acid was also found in a commercial detergent Omo Micro.<br>
Omo Micro was bought in a Danish supermarket. The enzymes were inactivated at 90°C (overnight).<br>
The following dosages in the detergent were used:<br>
4-Formyl-phenyl-boronic acid:   1.33 mM, or<br>
