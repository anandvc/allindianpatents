The catalysts of both WO 99/20592 and DE 19630832 require the presence of <br>
5     		palladium.<br>
WO 98/47850 relates to a process for producing acetic acid from ethane, ethylene or mixtures thereof and a catalyst having the formula WaXbYcZd in which X represents one or several of Pd, Pt, Ag and Au, Y represents one or several of V, Nb, Cr, Mn, Fe, Sn, Sb, Cu, Zn, U, Ni, and Bi and Z represents one or several of Li, Na, K, Rb, <br>

20     	
There remains a need for catalyst for the oxidation of ethane to ethylene and/or acetic acid and/or for the oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid and a process for the production of acetic acid and/or ethylene employing the catalyst.<br>
We have found that oxidation catalysts comprising molybdenum, vanadium and <br>
25	niobium in combination with oxygen which employ gold as an essential component <br>
in the absence of palladium can fulfil the need for an oxidation catalyst and process employing same.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a catalyst composition for the oxidation of ethane to ethylene and/or acetic acid and/or for the oxidation of ethylene to <br>
30	                   acetic acid which composition comprises in combination with oxygen the                                                       molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and gold in the absence of palladium<br>

Preferably, Y is selected from the group consisting of Bi, Ca, Ce, Cu, K, P, Sb, <br>
La and Te.<br>
An advantage of catalyst compositions according to the present invention is that <br>
25     	they can be more active and selective in converting ethane and/or ethylene to acetic acid and/or ethylene.<br>
The catalyst compositions may be prepared by any of the methods conventionally employed for the preparation of catalysts. Suitably the catalyst may be prepared from a solution of soluble compounds and/or complexes and/or compounds of <br>
30     	each of the metals. The solution is preferably an aqueous system having a pH in the range from 1 to 12, preferably from 2 to 8, at a temperature of from 20° to 100°C.<br>
3<br><br>
Generally, a mixture of compounds containing the elements is prepared by dissolving sufficient quantities of soluble compounds and dispersing any insoluble compounds so as to provide a desired gram-atom ratio of the elements in the catalyst composition. The catalyst composition may then be prepared by removing the solvent<br>
5    	 from the mixture. The catalyst may be calcined by heating to a temperature of from 200 to 550°C, suitably in air or oxygen, for a period of from 1 minute to 24 hours. Preferably, the air or oxygen is slowly flowing.<br>
The catalyst may be used unsupported or supported. Suitable supports include<br>
silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, silicon carbide and mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
10	Further details of a suitable method for preparing a catalyst composition may be<br>
found in, for example, EP-A-0166438.<br>
The catalyst may be used in the form of a fixed or a fluidised bed.<br>
In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for the production of ethylene and/or acetic acid from a gaseous mixture comprising ethane <br>
15     and/or ethylene which process comprises contacting the gaseous mixture with a<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas at elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst composition as hereinbefore described.<br>
Ethane is oxidised to ethylene and/or acetic acid and/or ethylene is oxidised to acetic acid. Preferably, ethane and optional ethylene is oxidised to a mixture comprising <br>
20      	ethylene and acetic acid which may be used with or without the addition or removal of acetic        <br>
acid and/or ethylene for the production of vinyl acetate by reaction with a molecular oxygen-containing gas in an integrated process.<br>
The feed gas comprises ethane and/or ethylene, preferably ethane.<br>
Ethane and/or ethylene may be used in substantially pure form or admixed with <br>
25     	one or more of nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water in the form of steam, which may<br>
be present in major amounts, for example greater than 5 volume percent or one or more of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, C3/C4 alkenes and alkenes, which may be present in minor amounts, for example less than 5 volume percent.<br>
The molecular oxygen-containing gas may be air or a gas richer or poorer in <br>
30    	 molecular oxygen than air, for example oxygen. A suitable gas may be, for example, oxygen diluted with a suitable diluent, for example nitrogen.<br>
4<br><br>
It is preferred to feed, in addition to ethane and/or ethylene and the molecular oxygen-containing gas, water (steam) because this can improve the selectivity to acetic acid.<br>
The elevated temperature may suitably be in the range from 200 to 500°C, <br>
5     	preferably from 200 to 400°C.<br>
The pressure may suitably be atmospheric or superatmospheric, for example in the range from 1 to 50 bar, preferably from 1 to 30 bar.<br>
The catalyst composition is preferably calcined before use in the process of the invention. Calcination may suitably be achieved by heating at a temperature suitably in <br>
10    	 the range from 250 to 500°C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas, for example                                air.<br>
Operating conditions and other information applicable to the performance of the invention may be found in the aforesaid prior art, for example US Patent No. 4,250,346.<br>
The process of the invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the 15     following Examples.<br>

20     CATALYST TEST PROCEDURE.<br>
Typically, 5 mis of catalyst was loaded into a fixed bed reactor made of Hasetelloy grade C276 of dimensions 12 mm internal diameter and length 40 cm. Glass beads were used to maintain the catalyst in position in the centre of the reactor. Above the catalyst, the glass beads thus acted as a mixing and pre-heating zone for gaseous and<br>
25     liquid reagents. The test apparatus was then pressure-tested at 21 bar with helium to check for leaks. Catalysts were then activated by heating to reaction pressure at 5° C/min in helium for 16 hours, to ensure full decomposition of catalyst precursors.<br>
For Examples 1 and 2 and the Comparative Experiments, the required flows of ethane, 20 % oxygen in helium and water were then introduced to the reactor, to ensure<br>
30      an inlet composition of 42 % v/v ethane, 6.6 % oxygen, 25 % v/v helium and 26.4 % v/v water (as steam). The total feed flow rate was maintained at a level to ensure a feed<br>
7<br><br>
	GHSV of about 3000/h. In the case of Example 3, performance was measured with less<br>
water in the feed than Examples 1 and 2, and ethylene was added to the feed mixture,<br>
such that an inlet feed composition of 52 % v/v ethane, 5 % v/v ethylene, 6.6 % oxygen,<br>
10 % v/v water and balance helium was used.<br>
5			After equilibrating for 30 minutes, gas samples were taken from the outlet<br>
stream to calibrate a GC (model Unicam 4400) for ethane, oxygen and helium. Next, the setpoint temperature of the reactor was increased until 75 % -100 % oxygen conversion was achieved, as indicated by the presence in the outlet stream of less than 2.2 % v/v oxygen.<br>
10			Following an equilibration period of 30 minutes, catalysts were then evaluated<br>
under steady state conditions for a period of typically 4-5 hours. Exit gas volume was measured over the run period by a water-gas meter. Liquid products were collected and weighed after the run period. Composition of gas and liquid products was measured using GC analysis (Unicam 4400 and 4200 fitted with TCD and FID detectors<br>
15     respectively).<br>
All feed and product flow rates and compositions were entered into a spreadsheet, and the following parameters calculated according to the formulae in which AcOH represents acetic acid :<br>
STY (space time yield) % = (g AcOH) / litre catalyst bed / hour<br>
20<br>
conversions :<br>
of ethane = (inlet mol ethane - outlet mol ethane) / inlet mol ethane * 100<br>
of oxygen = (inlet mol oxygen - outlet mol oxygen )/inlet mol oxygen * 100<br>
25      selectivities:<br>
to AcOH (C-mol %) = (outlet mol AcOH * 2) / (mol ethane converted * 2) * 100 to ethylene(C-mol %) = (outlet mol ethylene * 2)/(mol ethane converted * 2) * 100 to CO (C-mol %) = (outlet mol CO) / (mol ethane converted * 2) * 100 to C02 (C-mol %) = (outlet mol C02) / (mol ethane converted * 2) * 100<br>
30     to COx = selectivity to CO (C-mol %) + selectivity to C02 (C-mol %)<br>
8<br><br>
Typically, mass balance and carbon balance for a reaction was found to be 100 +/- 5 %. RESULTS<br>
The following tables 1 and 2 compare the catalyst performance of the above. Each catalyst was evaluated under standard conditions indicated in the tables, except for <br>
5   	 the temperature, which was varied so as to achieve 70-90 % oxygen conversion, in order to facilitate comparison.<br>
