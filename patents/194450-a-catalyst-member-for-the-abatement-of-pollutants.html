BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of The Invention<br>
The present invention is broadly concerned with catalysts for the abatement of pollutants, especially the abatement of NOX, HC and CO, particularly with their abatement in the exhaust gas of internal combustion engines More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a novel composition which comprises a catalytic component and an oxygen storage component comprising an intimately mixed oxide of cerium and praseodymium<br>
Related Art<br>
It is well-known in the art to utilize catalyst compositions, such as oxidation catalysts and those commonly referred to as three-way conversion catalysts ("TWC catalysts") to treat the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines Oxidation catalysts promote the oxidation of unburned hydrocarbons ("HC") and carbon monoxide ("CO") in engine exhaust to H2O and CO2 TWC catalysts promote such oxidation reactions as well as the substantially simultaneous reduction to N2 of nitrogen oxides ("NO,") in the exhaust It is well-known that successful functioning of the TWC catalyst to promote oxidation of HC and CO and substantially simultaneous reduction of NOX requires that the engine be operated at or close to storchiometnc air/fuel conditions<br>
It is also well-known in the art to provide such catalysts in the form of a refractory support material, such as a refractory metal oxide, e g , activated alumina, on which is dispersed a catalytic metal component such as one or more platinum group metal components The refractory metal oxide preferably has a high surface area to enhance the effectiveness of the catalytic metal component dispersed thereon The catalytic component provided by the refractory support material having the catalytic metal component dispersed thereon is normally provided as a thin coating or<br><br>
3824	-2-<br>
"washcoat" adhered to the walls of a refractory substrate The latter often takes the form of a body made from a suitable material such as cordierite, mullite or the like, which is formed to have a plurality of parallel, fine gas flow passages extending therethrough Typically, there may be from about 150 to 450 or more such gas flow passages per square inch of end face area of the substrate<br>
A typical TWC catalyst will comprise one or more platinum group metals, typically including palladium, or palladium plus rhodium, or platinum plus rhodium, or platinum plus rhodium plus palladium, dispersed on an activated alumina to provide a washcoat coated on the gas flow passage walls of a suitable substrate Optionally, a catalytic base metal component such as a transition metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements, e g, iron, nickel, manganese or cobalt, may be included in the composition<br>
Bulk ceria is known to be a useful additive for such catalyst compositions, especially TWC compositions in which the bulk ceria is believed to serve as an oxygen reservoir and is sometimes referred to as an oxygen storage component It is believed that, with the engine operating at air-to-fuel ratios which fluctuate slightly above and below stoichiometnc, the cena supplies additional oxygen for the oxidation reaction during rich (relatively oxygen-deficient) periods of operation and takes up oxygen during lean (relatively oxygen-rich) periods of operation Bulk ceria is not, however, immune to the problem of thermal degradation which affects other refractory metal oxides such as activated alumina At elevated temperatures both activated alumina and bulk cena suffer a reduction in their surface areas and this significantly reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst It is known to stabilize refractory metal oxides such as alumina and ceria against such thermal degradation One known technique is to impregnate into bulk alumina a solution of a soluble rare earth metal salt, e g , a cerium salt such as cerium nitrate, and then calcine the impregnated alumina to provide a cena-impregnated alumina to stabilize the alumina against thermal degradation It is similarly known to stabilize bulk cena against thermal degradation by impregnating it with a solution of a soluble aluminum salt such as aluminum nitrate, followed by calcination to provide an alumina-impregnated bulk ceria While such impregnation techniques are effective to reduce the effects of thermal degradation, cena is,<br><br>

nonetheless, subjected to degradation and marked reduction of the efficiency of the catalyst of which it is a part, not only by thermal degradation but also by poisoning of the catalyst by sulfur compounds, such as sulfur oxides which are engendered in the exhaust being treated from sulfur compounds contained in the fuel being burned<br>
U S Patent 5,075,276, issued December 24, 1991 to M Ozawa et al, discloses a catalyst containing ceria as an oxygen storage component which is said to be useful for purification of exhaust gases The Ozawa et al catalyst comprises a support substrate on which is disposed a washcoat comprising (a) a high surface area material which may be alumina or titanium oxide, (b) cerium oxide, (c) zirconium oxide and (d) at least one oxide of a rare earth element other than cerium and lanthanum Ozawa et al's preferred atomic ratios per 100 cerium atoms are from 5 to 100 zirconium atoms and from 5 to 150 rare earth element atoms Noble metals such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc, and base metals such as chromium, nickel, vanadium, copper, cobalt, manganese, etc, are exemplified as catalytic metals to be utilized on the Ozawa et al TWC catalysts (column 3, line 58 et seq ) Fifteen rare earth metals - including praseodymium - are listed at column 3, lines 33-43 as being suitable for item (d), although only yttrium, ytterbium, samarium and neodymium are exemplified The Ozawa et al composition is said to suppress thermal degradation of the oxygen storage component (column 2, lines 5-9) which would otherwise occur unchecked, because of normal degradation of the cena and consequent loss of surface area (column 1, lines<br>
22-45)<br>
Ozawa et al discusses the preparation of a composite oxide and/or a solid solution of (1) the oxide of the rare earth element other than cerium and lanthanum with (2) the cerium oxide, the zirconium oxide, or both The composite oxide or solid solution is said to be obtained by either of two methods One (column 3, line 65 et seq ) is by impregnating the catalyst layer (e g , platinum on alumina) with three solutions of, respectively, a cerium salt, a zirconium salt and a salt of the rare earth metal, and then "burning" the impregnated catalyst layer at 600°C or higher The other method (column 4, line 5 et seq ) comprises mixing the three oxide powders with alumina and "burning" the mixture at 800°C or higher At column 4, line 12 et seq, Ozawa et al discloses that the cerium oxide and zirconium oxide may be present in the<br><br>

catalyst layer or may be loaded on the surface of the catalyst layer The latter<br>
approach is said to improve the "catalyst property" remarkably<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a cena and praseodymia-containing catalyst composition which remarkably improves the oxygen storage capacity of an otherwise identical composition containing cena alone The composition contains, in addition to a catalytic material comprising a first catalytic metal component, an intimate combination of cena and praseodymia For example, ceria may be co-formed with praseodymia or bulk cena may be impregnated by a solution of a praseodymium salt and then heated to provide a praseodymia-impregnated ceria There may optionally be a limited amount of a second catalytic metal component dispersed on the combined ceria-praseodymia The resulting catalyst composition of the present invention does not exhibit particular improvement in surface area stability relative to known catalysts containing stabilized cena However, the catalysts of the present invention exhibit remarkable improvement over known catalysts with respect to total oxygen storage capacity after high temperature aging, even in the presence of sulfur compounds, e g , sulfur dioxide<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a catalyst member composing a substrate on which is disposed (a) a catalytic matenal composed of a refractory support material having a catalytically effective amount of a first catalytic metal component dispersed thereon, e g , a first platinum group metal component, and (b) an oxygen storage component which is segregated from the first catalytic metal component The oxygen storage component compnses an intimately mixed oxide of cerium and praseodymium having an atomic ratio of Pr Ce in the range of about 2 100 to 100 100 and having from zero to not more than about 10% by weight of a second catalytic metal dispersed thereon (The % by weight is based on the sum of the weight of the intimately mixed oxide of cerium and praseodymium plus the weight of the second catalytic metal)<br>
In one aspect of the invention the intimately mixed oxide may compnse one or more of a) praseodymia-impregnated bulk ceria, which may have an atomic ratio of<br><br>
3824	-5-<br>
Pr Ce in the range of from about 2 100 to 15 100 and b) one or more of a co-formed mixed oxide and a sintered mixed oxide Optionally, the intimately mixed oxide may have, for example, an atomic ratio of Pr Ce in the range of about 15 100 to 100 100<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the second catalytic metal component may optionally compose a second platinum group metal component dispersed on the oxygen storage component The second catalytic metal component may be either identical to or different from the first catalytic metal component<br>
Other aspects of the present invention provide, either alone or in combination, the following features the oxygen storage component may comprise at least about 5% by weight of the combined weight of the oxygen storage component and the catalytic component, the oxygen storage component may optionally further comprise one or more oxides of rare earth elements other than cerium and praseodymium, and the first platinum group metal component may be selected from the group consisting of one or more of platinum, palladium and rhodium components<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention provides that the oxygen storage component may be present in an amount of at least about 10% by weight (exclusive of the weight of any second catalytic metal component dispersed on the oxygen storage component) of the combined weight of the catalytic component and the oxygen storage component<br>
The present invention also provides for the intimately mixed oxide oxygen storage component to further comprise one or more additional rare earth metal oxides, e g , neodymia, the additional rare earth metal oxides comprising not more than about 20% by weight of the intimately mixed oxide<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the following terms and grammatical variations thereof shall have the indicated meanings<br>
Reference to a "catalytic metal component" means a catalytic metal present in any suitable form, whether as an oxide or other compound, as the elemental metal, or as an alloy with one or more other metals The term "platinum group metal" means and includes the metals platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium and indium<br>
The term "intimately mixed oxide" shall mean an intimate combination of cena, praseodymia and, optionally, one or more other rare earth metal oxides, such as<br><br>
3824	-6-<br>
neodymia, attained by any suitable method which provides more than a mere physical admixture of cena particles and praseodymia particles Mere physical admixtures are excluded from the defined term, however, a true chemical compound between cena and praseodymia is not required and an intimately mixed oxide may be attained by impregnating one of ceria and/or praseodymia into the other, co-forming the cena and praseodymia, or sintenng the cena and praseodymia together In each case, one or more of the optional rare earth metal oxides may also be included in the intimately mixed oxide<br>
The term "bulk" used with reference to ceria, alumina or another component of the catalyst composition means that the ceria, alumina or other component is present as fine discrete particles The term is intended to distinguish from the situation in which a component is "dispersed" onto or "impregnated" into another matenal<br>
Reference to a component such as praseodymia being "dispersed" onto or "impregnated" into a bulk material, such as bulk cena, means that a precursor of the praseodymia, such as a soluble praseodymium salt, for example, praseodymium nitrate, has been dissolved or otherwise dispersed in a liquid vehicle into which the bulk matenal is placed to disperse the precursor onto the particles of the bulk material This step is followed by calcination or other treatment of the bulk material to convert the dispersed precursor to the oxide and affix it on the surface of, or within the surface layers of, the bulk material<br>
The term "co-formed" used with respect to an intimately mixed oxide means that the two or more oxides are dispersed substantially throughout the entire matrix of the intimately mixed oxides as will occur, for example, when the respective oxides or precursors thereof are co-precipitated or co-gelled The defined term is intended to distinguish from a material being "impregnated" into or "dispersed" on another matenal<br>
The term "sintering" used with respect to an intimately mixed oxide means that the two or more precursor oxides are heated together at a temperature sufficiently high and for a penod long enough that the resulting product differs chemically or physically from a mere physical admixture of the oxides<br><br>
3824	-7-<br>
The term "activated alumina" means a relatively high BET surface area alumina comprised predominantly of gamma-alumina, although other phases, especially eta and delta, may be present in minor proportions<br>
The term "segregated" used with regard to the oxygen storage component being segregated from the first catalytic metal component, means that the oxygen storage component particles are not dispersed on the refractory support material on which the first catalytic metal is dispersed, and the first catalytic metal component is not dispersed on the oxygen storage component particles The first catalytic metal component is dispersed on another refractory support material, normally a metal oxide, e g, activated alumina particles The refractory support particles having the first catalytic metal component dispersed thereon may, however, (1) be admixed with the oxygen storage component particles or (2) may be present in the catalyst member in a separate, discrete layer disposed on or under a layer of the oxygen storage component In either case (1) or (2) the oxygen storage component is deemed to be "segregated" from the first catalytic metal component<br>
Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The sole Figure is a plot showing the conversion of CO and NO contained in a gaseous stream by catalysts containing intimately mixed oxides having varying atomic proportions of praseodymium and cerium<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS THEREOF<br>
An oxygen storage component ("OSC") in a catalyst composition helps to selectively convert CO to CO2 and NO, to N2 Ceria is currently the most widely used OSC in catalysts used to treat automobile engine exhausts The use of bulk ceria in intimate contact with a precious metal catalytic component is believed to facilitate the redox properties of the ceria at elevated temperatures (e g, temperatures above 450°C) However, as noted in Ozawa et al U S Patent 5,075,276 discussed above,<br><br>
3824	-8-<br>
bulk ceria rapidly loses its surface area upon exposure to high temperature This is especially so in a net reducing atmosphere, 1 e, a fuel-rich atmosphere If the cena is dispersed onto an alumina support (one of the two preparation techniques taught by Ozawa et al), the impregnated cena tends to interact strongly with the alumina support in a net reducing atmosphere to form a perovskite crystal structure, and to sinter drastically in a net oxidizing (fuel-poor, oxygen-rich) atmosphere With loss of its surface area by any of the foregoing mechanisms (thermal degradation of bulk cena, perovskite formation or sintering of dispersed ceria), the cena becomes a dramatically less effective OSC after prolonged aging In addition, the cena component is very sensitive to sulfur oxide, e g , SO2, poisoning Even prolonged exposure to a sulfur-containing atmosphere at relatively low temperatures (below 500°C) can completely destroy the OSC function of cena.<br>
The present invention provides an OSC comprising an intimately-combined mixed oxide of ceria and praseodymia which is combined in a catalyst member with a catalytic matenal including a first catalytic metal component from which the intimately mixed oxide is segregated The intimately mixed oxide may be free of platinum group metal components or, preferably, contains some platinum group metal components<br>
It has been found that neither ceria alone nor praseodymia alone possesses a significant OSC capacity after aging, but that an intimately-combined mixed oxide of praseodymium and cerium significantly enhances OSC properties after aging The intimate combination of cena and praseodymia in the intimately mixed oxide is attained by any suitable method including co-forming the two oxides, or impregnating a praseodymia precursor into bulk ceria and calcining, or vice versa, or calcining mixed cena and praseodymia precursors at an elevated temperature for a time sufficient to chemically and/or physically change the matenal which is calcined, or a combination thereof A praseodymium content in the range of from about 2 atomic percent to 50 atomic percent (i e , a Pr Ce atomic ratio in the range of about 2 100 to 100 100), of the total of praseodymium and cerium atoms in the praseodymia-ceria intimately mixed oxide has been found to be effective to enhance the OSC effect This Pr Ce atomic ratio can be attained either with a homogeneous intimately mixed oxide or bulk mixtures of various types of mixed oxides described herein<br><br>
3824	-9-<br>
Bulk Ceria<br>
Bulk ceria useful for the present invention typically may comprise at least 90 weight percent CeO2 The predominant impurity in commercially available bulk cenas comprises lanthana with lesser amounts of other rare earth metal oxides, including praseodymia in an amount of up to an atomic ratio of about one part of praseodymium per 100 parts of cerium as an impurity Thus, a bulk ceria useful for the preparation of the intimately mixed oxide of cerium and praseodymium of the present invention may comprise praseodymia as an impurity For typical automotive exhaust gas catalytic converters, the catalyst composition (catalyst material plus monolithic substrate) generally may comprise from about 0 5 to 4 0 grams per cubic inch of catalyst material Desirably, it is preferred to provide from about 0 2 to about 3 grams per cubic inch of the modified ceria of the present invention in the finished catalyst composition This would provide the intimately mixed oxide oxygen storage component of the present invention tn an amount of at least 5 weight percent of the total catalyst material (oxygen storage component plus catalytic material)<br>
Co-Forming to Form the Intimately Mixed Oxide<br>
The combining of praseodymia and ceria to form the intimately mixed oxide may be attained by co-forming Co-forming can be achieved by co-precipitation of any suitable soluble praseodymium and cerium salts or by any other suitable technique such as co-gelling or the like Whatever co-forming technique is used should result in a product which contains one oxide, e g, praseodymia, dispersed in the matrix of the other, e g , cena Thus, in the finished co-formed product, one oxide is not merely dispersed on the surface of particles of the other, or only within a surface layer thereof, thereby leaving a substantial core of, e g, the cena matrix, without praseodymia dispersed therein Salts of the praseodymium and cerium (and optionally, of other rare earth metals) used as precursors of the co-formed mixed oxides may include chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, acetates, etc The co-precipitates may, after washing, be dned to remove water and then calcined in air at about 500°C or higher to provide the co-formed mixed oxides<br><br>
3824	-10-<br>
Impregnation to Form the Intimately Mixed Oxide<br>
Impregnation or dispersion of one of cena and praseodymia into the other may also be utilized to form the intimately mixed oxide Usually, a precursor of praseodymia will be impregnated into bulk ceria rather than vice-versa This may be accomplished by any suitable technique, such as by contacting bulk cena particles with a solution or other liquid suspension of a praseodymia precursor as noted above in discussing co-precipitation, for example, a solution of praseodymium nitrate The soaked ceria particles are then dried and heated in air, usually at a temperature of about 500°C or more, whereby the praseodymium nitrate is converted to praseodymia and is impregnated into the surface and perhaps to a modest depth below the surface of the cena particles If it is desired to have the optional additional rare earth metal oxide present, vanations of this technique may be employed For example, precursors of other rare earth metal oxides may be co-impregnated into the bulk ceria particles Typically, a praseodymia-impregnated bulk cena has an atomic ratio of Pr Ce in the range of about 2 100 to 15 100<br>
Sintenng,to Form the Intimatelv Mixed Oxide<br>
The intimately mixed oxides of the present invention can also be formed by sintenng an admixture of precursor oxides, e g ,praseodymia and ceria, and, optionally, other rare earth metal oxide precursors The precursors are thoroughly mixed to assure substantially uniform dispersion throughout the admixture, and then heated, preferably in air, at an elevated temperature, e g, 500°C or higher, for a time sufficient to change the chemical and/or physical nature of the admixed particles<br>
Solid Solution<br>
Since most of the praseodymia-modified cerium oxides show an X-ray diffraction spectrum typical of a cubic cerium oxide structure, it appears that the mixed praseodymium and cerium oxides are solid solutions It is to be noted that incorporation of praseodymia into the cena does not appear to significantly retard the surface area thermal degradation of the intimately mixed oxide upon exposure to high<br><br>
3824	-11-<br>
temperatures, e g , 450°C to 800°C Enhancement of the OSC capability of the intimately mixed oxides of the present invention is believed to primarily result from the unexpected synergism between cena and praseodymia<br>

A physical mixture of bulk cena (the same type as used in Example 4) and bulk praseodyrrua obtained from a commercially available source was prepared by thoroughly mixing 8 grams of the ceria powder and 2 grams of the praseodymia powder The powder mixture had 90 m2/g BET surface area The powder mixture was not formed into an intimately mixed oxide and was designated Powder C5<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of Cena-Praseodvmia-Neodvmia Mixture<br>
The sample preparation of the intimately mixed oxide was essentially the same as described in Example 1 Neodymium nitrate crystals from a commercial source were dissolved in the solution of cerium nitrate and praseodymium nitrate obtained in Part B of Example 1 After calcination at 550°C for 20 hours, the BET surface area of<br><br>
3824	-15-<br>
the oxide powder was 52 m2/g The resulting mixed oxide powder contained 50 3 atomic percent cerium, 49 6 atomic percent praseodymium and 0 1 atomic percent neodymium The powder sample was designated Powder E6<br>
Example 7<br>
A A commercially available gamma-alumina powder having a BET surface area of 150 m2/g was impregnated with a Rh nitrate solution and then heated for 3 hours at 350°C to provide a rhodium-containing powder comprising 0 578 percent by weight rhodium A thirty gram portion of the rhodium-containing powder was further impregnated with an amine-solubilized platinum hydroxide solution to obtain a 3 68 percent by weight platinum loading The platinum and rhodium-containing alumina was ballmilled with acetic acid and water to form a slurry which was designated Slurry A<br>
B 1 gram of the oxide powders designated in each of Examples 3-5, was impregnated with an amine-solubilized platinum hydroxide solution to obtain a 0 3% by weight platinum loading on the powder Each of the platinum-containing oxide powders was individually mixed with a quantity of Slurry A and an alumina binder to form individual combined slurries Each combined slurry was dried and calcined at 450°C to form a catalyst powder Each catalyst powder sample contained 34 weight percent of platinum and rhodium-containing alumina, 49 weight percent rare earth mixed metal oxide and 17 weight percent alumina binder These samples were designated by appending the letter S to the designation given in Examples 3-5 to the oxide powders used in preparation of the samples<br>
C A reference control sample containing 34 weight percent alumina having platinum-rhodium dispersed thereon and 66 weight percent alumina binder was prepared by combining Slurry A and the alumina binder only The comparative sample obtained from this powder was designated REF 5<br>
D Each catalyst solid sample from parts B and C was crushed to powder and sieved to obtain catalyst test samples consisting of particles in the 240-400 micron (about 300 microns average) diameter size range A 20 mg sample of each catalyst<br><br>
3824	-16-<br>
test sample was mixed with 80 mg of like-sized cordiente particles (300 microns diameter average particle size)<br>
E Each cordiente-containing sample obtained in part D was individually loaded into a laboratory Model Gas Reactor The catalyst sample was aged at 1000°C for 6 hours in a simulated exhaust gas mixture containing 20 volume parts per million ("upper") SO2 and employing a perturbation of plus or minus 0 2 air/fuel ratio at 0 167 Hz at stoichiometnc set point and 350,000 VHSV space velocity The aged catalyst was then evaluated on the same reactor using similar exhaust gas mixture employing a plus or minus 0 1 air/fuel ratio perturbation The average feed gas compositions at the evaluation conditions contained 0 57% CO, 0 19% H2, 0 19% NO, 0 285% O2, 20 vppm SO2 (2 vppm SO2 in the evaluation of TABLE III, below), and balance N2 The powders described in Example 2 were tested as well<br>
The results of conversion efficiencies of CO and NO at 500°C of the materials described in Example 2 are presented in the sole Figure wherein the percent conversion is plotted against the weight percents of ceria and praseodyrma in the intimately mixed oxides With reference to the Figure it is apparent that neither ceria alone nor praseodymia alone shows any significant oxygen storage capacity after aging, even with the platinum catalytic component in intimate contact with the oxide Addition of praseodymium into the cena lattice, however, significantly enhances the cena against deterioration under the SO2 aging conditions employed It appears that an intimately cerium-praseodymium oxide containing 20% praseodymia exhibits the greatest enhancement of the OSC Separate characterization of the intimately mixed oxide powders after thermal aging at 1000°C reveals that incorporation of praseodymia into cena does not increase thermal stability of the cena Because bulk ceria alone is quite sensitive to sulfur dioxide poisoning, it is surpnsing that the mixed praseodymium-cerium oxide contributes to the better OSC function even after aging<br>
Improvement of the OSC characteristic of ceria can also be achieved by surface doping of the cena particles with praseodymium and/or by providing intimate contact with a limited amount, not more than about 10 weight percent of a platinum group metal catalytic component, e g, platinum and rhodium The OSC is segregated from other catalytic metal components of the catalyst composition, such as a platinum group<br><br>
3824	.17-<br>
metal component dispersed on a refractory metal oxide support, e g , activated alumina Thus, an originally inexpensive ceria powder, inferior as an oxygen storage component, turns into a cena having a supenor OSC function after modification of the cena with praseodymium to form an intimately mixed oxide, and the addition of a limited amount of platinum, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention The enhanced performance of this embodiment of the present invention is clearly indicated by the data of TABLE I, which were obtained by testing as described in Example 7, part E<br>

The data of TABLE II illustrate the unexpected superior effect on conversion performance of praseodymia as a modifier for cena relative to other rare earth oxide modifiers TABLE III clearly reveals that C5-S, a sample containing a simple physical mixture of bulk ceria and bulk praseodymia, unlike the intimately mixed oxide obtained by the practices of the present invention, does not enhance the cena OSC function against aging as do the intimately mixed oxides of the invention<br>
