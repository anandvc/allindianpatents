The invention relates to multiparticulate tablets comprising coated particles with prolonged release and process for manufacturing the same and more specifically to sustained-release coated granules or granulates, to a process for preparing them and to multiparticulate tables comprising said coated particles.<br>
Sustained-release multiparticulate forms are well known in the prior art.<br>
These forms exist in particular in unit forms such as gel capsules or multiparticulate tablets.<br>
The term "multiparticulate tablets" means a tablets comprising, firstly, particles containing at least one active principle, which are individually coated with a polymer film that modulates the release of the active principle over a period that can range form 8 to 24 hours, and, secondly, tablctting excipients.<br>
'The coated particles are first mixed with the tablettmg excipients, the mixture then being compressed so as to give a homogeneous unit form.<br>
During the compression step, the the polymer coating experiences large stresses, which are such that cracks or breaks may appear, resulting in loss and immediate availability of all of the active principle.<br>
The polymer film should thus be flexible enough and deformable enough withstand compression.<br>
To evaluate the mechanical properties and characteristics of the polymer film, parameters such as the breaking strength or the percentage of eleogation.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
may be used. These mechanical characteristics may be determined by the methods described in standards DIN 53455 and ISO/RI 184.<br>
Acrylic polymers are a family of polymers with deformation properties that allow the preparation of multiparticulate tablets.<br>
In Patent Application EP 1 032 374, the Applicant describes spheroids comprising, in the core or as a layer, a thermoplastic excipient with a pasty to semisolid consistency at 20°C, and a flexible and deformable film whose percentage of elongation is greater than or equal to 50%, and which consists of a neutral copolymer of acrylic acid esters, for example the product sold under the brand name Eudragit® NE30D, the percentage of elongation of which is 600% and the compressive strength of which is 8 N/m2.<br>
Polymers that have mediocre elongation or compressive strength parameters do not normally absorb the mechanical stresses associated with tabletting (International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 143, 13-23 (1996)).<br>
Numerous publications describe cellulose-based polymers as being brittle and poorly elastic. This is the case, for example, for ethylcellulose, the elongation capacity of which is usually less than 15%, which makes it difficult for it to be used as a coating agent for particles intended to be compressed (Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 43, 1-8 (1997)).<br>
Studies on ethylcellulose-based free films show that the addition of plasticizers or of soluble agents to the coating film, and the use of a maturation step under certain temperature and humidity conditions (Int. J. Pharm.  104,  203-213,  (1994) ,  Acta Pharm. Technol,<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
35(4), 232-237, (1989)) can make it possible to improve the properties of films based on cellulose derivatives.<br>
However, this improvement is insufficient. Moreover, the release profile of the active principle is directly influenced by the composition of the coating film.<br>
It would be particularly advantageous to have available means for making them systematically usable for the constitution of coating films, without modifying their composition or having an influence on their active principle release profile.<br>
To its credit, the Applicant has now found that this aim can be achieved and that it has become possible to obtain sustained-release coated particles with a coating consisting of at least one cellulosic polymer such that the release profile of a multiparticulate tablet based on these particles is identical to that of the coated particles before tabletting, the two release profiles being determined under similar working conditions (dissolution medium, apparatus, method), if said particles are provided with a protective coating based on at least one thermoplastic agent with a melting point of from 25 to 100°C applied over the cellulosic polymer coating.<br>
It is considered that two release profiles are similar when the variation between the means of the values measured for each of the profiles at each sampling time is less than or equal to plus or minus 15% and preferably plus or minus 10%, i.e., in the present case, between the mean value obtained for the coated particles before tabletting and that obtained for the multiparticulate tablet based on said particles.<br>
If the variation under consideration is greater than<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
15%, it is considered that the release profile is significantly modified.<br>
It follows therefrom that the sustained-release coated particles in accordance with the invention, which comprise<br>
a core comprising an active principle and at least<br>
one binder, and<br>
a coating film based on at. least one cellulose-based<br>
polymer, alone or as a mixture with a plasticizer, are characterized in that they comprise a protective coating based on at least one thermoplastic agent with a melting point of from about 25°C to about 100°C and which is applied to the coating film based on at least one cellulosic polymer.<br>
The particles in accordance with the invention consist of granules or granulates, depending on the process for obtaining the active core.<br>
The granulates are obtained by dry or wet granulation and the granules by mounting the active principle on a neutral support.<br>
The core of the particle comprises at least one active principle chosen from those of the group comprising gastrointestinal sedatives, antacids, analgesics, antiinflammatories,  coronary vasodilators,  peripheral and cerebral  vasodilators,   antiinfectives,   antibiotics, antiviral  agents,  antiparasitic  agents,  anticancer agents,  anxiolytics,  neuroleptics,  central  nervous system  stimulants,   antidepressants,   antihistamines, antidiarrheal agents,  laxatives,  dietary supplements, immunodepressants,   hypocholesterolemiants,   hormones, enzymes, antispasmodics, antianginal agents, medicinal products that affect the heart rate, medicinal products used  in  the  treatment  of  arterial  hypertension.<br><br>

This active principle, initially in the form of powder or microcrystals, is used in dry form for the preparation of granulates, and in the form of a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or organic solvent for mounting on neutral supports.<br>
Advantageously, the cores comprise a binder for binding the powder or the microcrystals of active principle and the other possible constituents, so as to give particles of a size sufficient to facilitate the coating operation.<br>
The binder may be chosen from the group especially comprising  cellulosic  polymers,   acrylic  polymers, povidones,  copovidones,  polyvinyl  alcohols,  alginic acid,  sodium alginate,  starch, pregelatinized starch, sucroses and derivatives thereof,  guar gum and polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof.<br>

Among the acrylic polymers that are advantageously chosen are ammoniomethacrylate copolymer, acrylic and methacrylic acid polymers and copolymers, polyacrylates<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
and polymethacrylates, used alone or as a mixture.<br>

The core optionally comprises a diluent and an antistatic agent.<br>
The diluent may be chosen from the group especially comprising cellulosic derivatives and preferably microcrystalline cellulose, starches alone, lactose and polyols, and preferentially mannitol.<br>
The core may also be a neutral support consisting of a mixture of starch and sucrose, or alternatively micro-crystalline cellulose.<br>
The diluent is present in proportions that may be up to 95% by weight and preferably up to 50% by weight relative to the weight of the uncoated particles.<br>
Its role is to increase the total mass of particles to be coated and to obtain a population of particles of homogeneous size.<br>
The antistatic agent may be chosen from the group comprising colloidal silica, especially the product sold under the brand name Aerosil®, and preferentially precipitated silica, especially the product sold under the name Syloid® FP244, and micronized or nonmicronized talc, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The antistatic agent is present in proportions that may be up to 10% by weight and preferably up to 3% by weight relative to the weight of the uncoated particles.<br><br>
-7-<br>
It improves the fluidization of the material during the use of a fluidized air bed, in particular in the case of powder granulation.<br>
The cores comprising the active principle are then coated with a first coating composition.<br>
The coating film thus obtained allows the sustained release of the active principle.<br>
This coating film consists of at least one cellulosic polymer, alone or as a mixture with a plasticizer.<br>
Ethylcellulose is preferably chosen among cellulosic polymers.<br>
This coating film is applied by spraying a solution, a suspension or a colloidal dispersion of this polymer in a solvent, to form a continuous film that covers all of the surface of each particle, irrespective of the surface state of said particle, in an amount sufficient to allow the sustained release of the active principle over a period that may range from 8 to 24 hours.<br>
The coating polymer is present in proportions that may be up to 50% and preferably up to 20%, calculated as weight gain relative to the mass of cores to be coated.<br>
The solvent chosen to spray the cellulosic polymer may be  water,  an  organic  solvent,  such  as  ethanol, isopropanol or acetone, or a mixture of solvents.<br>
In this case, the polymer is in the form of a solution, suspension or dispersion, in the solvent or mixture of solvents. It is preferably in the form of a solution in an  organic solvent, preferably in isopropanol.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
The coating composition also optionally comprises a pore-forming agent, a plasticizer, a surfactant, an antistatic agent or a lubricant.<br>
The pore-forming agent can modify the release of the active principle, and in particular can accelerate it.<br>
This agent should be soluble in media with a pH of less than or equal to 5. It may be chosen, for example, from sugars, polyols, acrylic or methacrylic acid polymers or  copolymers,  hydroxylated  cellulose  derivatives, povidones and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
The plasticizer is chosen from the group comprising triethyl citrate, acetyltributyl citrate, triacetin, tributyl citrate, diethyl phthalate, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates and mono- and diacetyl glycerides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Its function is to lower the glass transition temperature of the coating film and to improve its mechanical properties.<br>
It is used in a proportion of up to 40% and preferably<br>
between 15% and 30%, expressed on a weight basis relative to the dry weight of polymer.<br>
The  surfactant  is  chosen  from  anionic,  cationic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants.<br>
The antistatic agent optionally used is employed to avoid problems associated with static electricity. It is chosen from the group comprising micronized or nonmicronized talc, colloidal silica (Aerosil® 200), treated silica (Aerosol® R972) and precipitated silica (Syloid® FP244), and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
It is used in a proportion of up to 10% by weight, preferably between 0% and 3% and even more preferably less than 1% by weight.<br>
The lubricant is chosen from the group comprising magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, micronized polyoxyethylene glycols (micronized Macrogol 6000) and sodium benzoate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
An optional polymer layer may be applied between the core and the functional polymer film to insulate the core, comprising the active principle, from the layer of cellulosic polymer that allows the sustained release of the active principle.<br>
The polymer constituting the optional layer may be chosen from the same polymers as those used as binder; in particular, it may be identical to or different from the polymer used as binder in the core comprising the active principle.<br>
The advantage provided by this optional layer is that it allows the active principle to be insulated from the functional polymer that allows its sustained release, when there  is  incompatibility between the active principle and the functional polymer,<br>
when the active principle is unstable at the pH of the solution or suspension used to apply the functional polymer,<br>
when the active principle has a high solubility in the solvent used to apply the functional polymer, which may be the cause of "migration" of the active principle into the polymer film, thus making it difficult to obtain sustained release of the active principle.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
The amount of polymer applied is between 1% and 10% and preferably between 2% and 5% in weight gain relative to the mass of cores comprising the active principle used.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the layer of cellulosic polymer allowing the sustained release of the active principle is covered with a coating that protects it.<br>
This protective coating is based on at least one thermoplastic agent with a melting point of from about 25°C to about 100°C and optionally a lubricant.<br>
The thermoplastic agent is chosen from the group comprising partially hydrogenated oils, beeswax, carnauba wax, paraffin waxes, silicone waxes, fatty alcohols, C12-C18 fatty acids, solid semisynthetic glycerides, glyceryl monoesters, diesters or triesters, polyoxyethylene glycols and polyoxyethylenated glycosyl glycerides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The function of the protective coating is to absorb the stresses caused by tabletting, and to avoid deformation, alteration or breaking of the coating film consisting of the cellulose-based polymer, the function of which is to ensure the sustained release of the active principle.<br>
The thermoplastic agent is used in a proportion that may be up to 100% in weight gain and preferably between 10% and 50% in weight gain, relative to the mass of granulate to be coated.<br>
It is preferably chosen from hydrophilic excipients with a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) of greater than 10, so as not to modify the release profile of the<br><br>
-11-<br>
active principle.<br>
The protective coating may also comprise an antistatic agent.<br>
The particle size distribution of the particles in accordance with the invention allows their use in the manufacture of multiparticulate tablets.<br>
Advantageously, the size of the particles is inferior to 700 urn, given that the size of at least 50% and preferably of at least 70% of the particles is between 150 and 500 urn, and that the size of less than 15% of the particles is inferior to 150 urn.<br>
The particle size is determined by the conventional methods, for example using a set of screens of calibrated mesh size, or by laser diffraction.<br>
By virtue of their mechanical properties, the sustained-release coated particles thus prepared are particularly suitable for inclusion in the constitution of multiparticulate tablets.<br>
The multiparticulate tablet in accordance with the invention, is characterized in that it is based on coated particles in accordance with the invention, this tablet also comprising a mixture of excipients comprising<br>
a disintegrant and/or a swelling agent,<br>

The lubricant is totally or partially dispersed in the mixture of tabletting excipients and/or sprayed onto the surface of the tablet at the time of tabletting.<br>
The antistatic agent may chosen from the group comprising colloidal silica, especially the product sold under the brand name Aerosil®, and preferentially precipitated silica, especially the product sold under the name Syloid® FP244, and micronized or nonmicronized talc, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The permeabilizer is chosen from the group especially comprising silicas with great affinity for aqueous solvents, such as the precipitated silica more commonly known under the brand name Syloid®, maltodextrins and ß-cyclodextrins, and mixtures thereof.<br>
It allows the creation of a hydrophilic network that facilitates the penetration of saliva and thus contributes toward better disintegration of the tablet.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
The sweetener may be chosen from the group especially comprising aspartame, potassium acesulfame, sodium saccharinate, neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, sucralose and monoammonium glycyrrhizinate, and mixtures thereof.<br>

In the multiparticulate tablets in accordance with the invention, the proportion of the mixture of excipients relative to the coated particles is from 0.4 to 10 and preferably between 1 and 5 parts by weight, said mixture of excipients comprising:<br>
-	 from 1% to 15% and preferably from 2% to 7% by weight of disintegrant and/or swelling agent,<br>

In one preferred embodiment, the multiparticulate tablet according to the invention is an orodispersible tablet that disintegrates in the mouth, on contact with the saliva, in less than 60 seconds and preferably in less than 40 seconds, forming a suspension that is easy to swallow.<br>
The disintegration time corresponds to the duration between the moment that the tablet is placed in the mouth in contact with the saliva and the moment of swallowing of the suspension resulting from the disintegration without chewing of the tablet in contact<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
with the saliva.<br>
The diluent is chosen from soluble agents with binding properties, consisting of polyols of less than 13 carbon atoms and being either in the form of a directly compressible product with a mean particle diameter of from 100 to 500 pm, or in the form of a powder with a mean particle diameter of less than 100 urn, these polyols preferably being chosen from the group comprising mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol, used in the form of a directly compressible product, whereas, in the case where there are at least two soluble diluents with binding properties, one is present in the directly compressible form and the other in the form of a powder, the polyol possibly being the same, the proportions of directly compressible polyol and of polyol powder being from 99/1 to 20/80 and preferably from 80/20 to 20/80.<br>
A subject  of  the  invention  is  also  a process  for preparing sustained-release coated particles.<br>
The   process   under   consideration comprises,   in accordance with the invention, the following steps:<br>
preparation  by  wet  granulation  or  mounting  on<br>
neutral supports,  of a core comprising the active<br>
principle,<br>
coating of the cores thus obtained by spraying a<br>
coating  composition  consisting  of  at  least  one<br>
cellulose-based polymer,<br>
coating of the coated particles thus obtained by<br>
spraying with a protective coating composition based<br>
on an excipient of thermoplastic type,<br>
drying.<br>
According to this embodiment, the successive steps of the process may be performed in different machines or<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
in the same machine.<br>
In a first advantageous embodiment, the cores comprising the active principle are prepared by granulation according to the following steps:<br>
dry-mixing of the active principle in the form of<br>
powder or microcrystals, optionally with the diluent<br>
and an antistatic agent,<br>
granulation of the mixture obtained by spraying with<br>
a solution of the binder,<br>
drying.<br>
For the granulation, a high-energy granulator, a planetary mixer or a fluidized air bed is advantageously used.<br>
In the case of granulation in a fluidized air bed, the powder mixture containing the active principle and, possibly, the diluent and the antistatic agent, is introduced into the machine and then granulated by spraying onto said powder mixture a solution or suspension of excipients comprising at least one binder.<br>
According  to  another  advantageous  embodiment,	the<br>
polymer  used  during  the  granulation  step  and	the<br>
polymer used during the coating step are identical.	In<br>
this  case,  the  granulation  step  differs  from	the<br>
coating  step  by  different  parameters,  such  as	the<br>
spraying flow rate of the excipient mixture and	the<br>
atomization pressure of said mixture.<br>
Thus, during the granulation step, the spraying flow rate of excipient suspension is higher than during the coating step, whereas the atomization pressure of the excipient suspension is lower during the granulation step than during the coating step.<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
In practice, at the laboratory scale in a fluidized air bed machine, for example of the Glatt CPCG3 type, the spraying flow rate of the excipient mixture is, during the granulation step, from 15 to 30 grams/minute and the atomization pressure is from 1 to 2.5 bar.<br>
During the coating step, the spraying flow rate of the coating suspension is from 10 to 25 grams/minute, while the atomization pressure is from 1.5 to 3 bar.<br>
Advantageously, a proportion of from 10% to 30% of the mixture of excipients is sprayed during the granulation step, the remainder to 100% being sprayed during the coating step.<br>
In a second embodiment of the cores comprising the active principle, they are prepared by mounting on neutral supports according to the following steps:<br>
spraying  onto  neutral  supports  a  solution  or  a<br>
suspension of the active principle, containing the<br>
dissolved binder,<br>
drying.<br>
The cores thus obtained are then coated by successive spraying of the various coating compositions, and then dried.<br>
The polymer coating consisting of a cellulosic derivative is sprayed in the form of a solution, a suspension or a colloidal dispersion.<br>
The thermoplastic excipient may be applied by spraying in the form of a solution in an aqueous or organic solvent.<br>
In  one  particular  embodiment,   the  thermoplastic<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
excipient may be heated to a temperature above its melting point, and then sprayed in liquid form without solvent.<br>
In this case, a thermostatically regulated spraying device that makes it possible to avoid obstructing the tubes is installed.<br>
All the steps of the process in accordance with the invention may be performed in a sugar-coating turbo-mixer, in a perforated turbomixer or in a fluidized air bed.<br>
In  one  preferred  embodiment  of  the  process	in<br>
accordance  with  the  invention,  all  the  steps	of<br>
preparation of the active core and of coating	are<br>
performed in a fluidized air bed.<br>
The fluidized air bed is equipped with a spraying nozzle whose spraying position and orientation may be chosen. The spraying is designated by the terms of the art "top spray", "bottom spray' or "tangential spray".<br>
This choice makes it possible to control the growth kinetics of the particles and to avoid phenomena of adhesion, associated with the nature of the active principle and with the composition of the sprayed binder or coating composition, and various process parameters (for example temperature, air pressure or flow rate of solution).<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing multiparticulate tablets comprising the sustained-release coated particles.<br>
This process includes, in accordance with the invention, the following steps:<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
dry-mixing of the coated particles, obtained according to the process described above, with the tabletting excipients,<br>
compression of the mixture thus obtained, tc make a unit form.<br>
The compression of the mixture may be performed on an alternating or rotary tabletting machine.<br>
The stresses exerted during the compression step may range from 5 kN to 50 kN and preferably from 5 kN to 15 kN.<br>
The hardness of the tablets thus obtained is preferably from 1 to 10 kp and more preferably from 1 to 5 kp, measured according to the method of the European Pharmacopea (2.9.8), 1 kp being equal to 9.8 N.<br>
Preferably, the hardness of the multiparticulate tablet is adapted firstly so as to obtain a friability of less than 2%, measured according to the method of the European Pharmacopea, while at the same time maintaining a dissolution profile identical to that of the coated particles, and secondly so as to obtain a disintegration time in the mouth of less than or equal to 60 seconds and preferably less than or equal to 40 seconds.<br>
The tablets may have a diameter of from 6 mm to 17 mm. They may be round, oval or oblong in shape, having a flat or concave surface, and may optionally be engraved.<br>
In the case of orodispersible tablets, "polo" punches may be used, i.e. punches for obtaining round, flat tablets with concavity at the center of the two faces.<br><br>

The tablets have a mass preferably of between 0.1 and 2.0 grams.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly with the aid of the examples of preparation of the coated particles and of the multiparticulate tablets in accordance with the invention. These examples are given solely as illustrations and advantageous embodiments of the invention and do not in any way constitute a limitation thereof.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Coated granulates comprising oxycodone HC1 as active principle.<br>
Granulation<br>
500 grams of oxycodone HC1 are mixed with 15 grams of Syloid® 244 FP [i.e. 3% (w/w) relative to the mass of oxycodone HC1].<br>
The mixture of powders is granulated in a planetary mixer using a wetting solution consisting of ethyl-cellulose N7, at a concentration of 8% (w/w) in isopropanol.<br>
The grain formed is oven-dried at 45°C for 5 hours and then screened through a 0.9 mm diameter screen.<br>
Coating<br>
The coating operation is performed in a Glatt GPCG-3 fluidized air bed equipped with a Wurster insert ("bottom spray").<br>
The mass obtained is spray-coated with the same solution as in the preceding step.<br>
An amount of polymer corresponding to 42% (w/w), calculated as weight gain relative to the mass of starting uncoated granulates, is applied.<br>
The particle size distribution of the coated particles E1 is given in Table 1.<br><br>

Conclusion:<br>
It is possible to deduce from the results collated in<br>
Table 5 that the compression causes rupture of the<br>
ethylcellulose  film,  which  results  in  accelerated<br>
release of the active principle.<br>
The result of this is that the mechanical properties of<br>
the coating film are not suitable for compression in<br>
the form of a sustained-release orodispersible tablet.<br>

Conclusion<br>
From examination of the results collated in Table 15,<br>
it is possible to conclude that the protective coating<br>
significantly improves the mechanical properties of the<br>
ethylcellulose  N7   film  in  terms  of  compressive<br>
strength.<br>
It is also possible to see that the profiles obtained<br>
are independent of the pH of the medium in which the<br>
dissolution is performed.<br>
Example 6:<br>
To evaluate the differences existing between the compressive strengths in the case of the cellulose-based polymers, on the one hand, and the acrylic polymers, on the other hand, the same test as in examples 3 and 4 is carried out, using as coating polymer a polyacrylate known under the brand name Eudragit® NE30D sold by Rohm.<br>
Coating with Eudragit® NE30D<br>
The operation is performed in a Glatt GPCG-3 fluidized<br>
air  bed  equipped  with  a  Wurster  insert  ("bottom<br>
spray").<br>
750  grams  of  granules  obtained  after  mounting  on<br>
neutral supports of example 3 are spray-coated with an<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
aqueous dispersion of Eudragit® NE30D, diluted to 20% (w/w), also containing micronized talc, in an amount corresponding to 10% (w/w), relative to the dry mass of polymer.<br>
An amount of polymer corresponding to 5% (w/w), calculated as weight gain relative to the mass of granules to be coated, is applied.<br>
After coating, an additional step of maturation of the film at 60°C for 2 hours is performed.<br>
Particles designated as E4 are thus obtained, the particle size distribution of which is given in Table 16:<br>
Table 16<br><br>
Mesh aperture	E4<br>
&gt;0.500 mm	20.6%<br>

0.355 mm-0.425 mm	2 6.4%<br>
0.250 mm-0.355 mm	6.8%<br>
Application of a protective coating<br>
The operation is performed in a Glatt GPCG-3 fluidized air bed equipped with a Wurster insert ("bottom spray").<br>
The coated granules £4 obtained in the preceding step are spray-coated with an aqueous solution of PEG 4000 also containing micronized talc, in a proportion corresponding to 10% (w/w) relative to the dry mass of PEG.<br>
An amount of protective coating corresponding to 20% (w/w), calculated as weight gain relative to the mass of granule E4, is applied.<br>
Coated particles E5 are thus obtained, the particle size distribution of which is given in Table 17:<br><br>

Conclusion<br>
From - examination of the data collated in Table 21, it is found that the protective coating does not improve the mechanical properties of the film formed with Eudragit® NE30D, which is already flexible and deformable. This is attested by the low variation observed between the dissolution profiles of the orodispersible tablets T6 and T7 containing the coated granules E4 and E5, respectively.<br>
