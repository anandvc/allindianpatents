				<td>PROCESS FOR INTERFACING A CONTROL UNIT AND<br>
A PROGRAM FOR MODELLING AN ACTIVE CHAIN DIAGNOSIS<br>
Description<br>
The present invention is with regard to a process for interfacing a control unit and a program for modelling an active chain diagnosis i.e. to create diagnostic information for a system diagnosis by simulating nominal and error behaviour. The answer routines extracted hereby can then be stored in a control unit and can be used for a quick error search i.e. containing the problem to a few suspect components.<br>
Error diagnoses get increasingly complex as a result of an increased use of electronics, for example, to control motors, particularly in the case of motor vehicles. Here, it is expedient to analyse possible errors in the system, using an active chain diagnosis running in an external computer. In order to be able to model such active chains it is established, for example, that a simulation of both systems (the program to be analysed and the program for creation of an active chain) be executed on a computer, whereby customisation of the computing speed is necessary here. This precipitates great complexity because not only the control unit software but also a model of the system must be transferred to the computer. This, however, also influences system behaviour so that the insights can only be conditionally transferred on to the original.<br>
In order to solve the herewith accompanying problems, it is established that by using an original control unit, the process flow of the faster system can be slowed down, for example, using a CPU clock. On the other hand, it is also possible to accelerate the process flow of the slower system in a limited manner, for example, by providing a high-capacity computer.  However, the problem that the<br><br>
original behaviour can not be achieved 100% continues to remain and considerable customisation complexity arises.<br>
The task of the present invention is interfacing a control unit e.g. of a control unit that is used in a motor vehicle for operating a motor, with a program for computing an active diagnosis (evaluation of sensor values and actuating variables in different operating states for error detection is understood herewith). Computation speed in the case of modelling of active chains is considerably slower than the speed of the control unit. The process flows of the control unit and the active chain diagnosis must be synchronised since interventions in the control unit, for example, for modifying an operating point are, however, necessary through the active chain diagnosis, subject to the sensor values and actuating variables.<br>
To this end, the present invention aims at providing a (applications) control unit without modifying conventional hardware and software components.<br>
This objective is achieved using a process with characteristics of patent claim 1, a computer program with characteristics of patent claim 3 and a computer program product with characteristics of patent claim 4.<br>
Simulation to be executed within the framework of the process, in accordance with the invention, can be carried out in an advantageous manner with existing standard software. If necessary, only intervention points for control unit input are to be cut free in case the same are not anyway already present. Synchronisation problems which occur, for example, when stopping software and/or a computer, could be effectively avoided in accordance with the invention. The process in accordance with the invention proves itself to be particularly economic since a software code of the control unit does not have to be transferred to an external computer.<br><br>
The system behaviour computed and/or simulated in accordance with the invention corresponds to the original behaviour of the control unit. Hardware does not have to be customised to a slower process flow of the active chain diagnosis computation. Problem-free transfer of the process in accordance with the invention to any control unit variant/system is possible.<br>
Beneficial designs of the process in accordance with the invention form the subject of the sub claims.<br>
The process run for an active chain diagnosis appropriately takes place with n interventions corresponding to n+1 times. Using this modus operandi, a particularly economic and satisfactorily precise modelling of the active chains is feasible.<br>
The present invention is now described further by means of the enclosed diagram. Figure 1 illustrates a flow chart of the preferred design of the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
Pursuant to the preferred design of the process, in accordance with the invention, presented in Figure 1, the same is composed of four runs 100, 200, 300, 400. It is to be noted that any number n of runs is conceivable, whereby other runs connect to the four illustrated runs in an analogous manner.<br>
A working point of a control unit is started up in the first step 101 of the first run. This can be executed, in particular, by emitting start control signals (e.g. accelerator position, ambient temperature, engine temperature etc.) for preparation of a default operating condition. This type of condition can be predetermined by specifying several operating parameters.<br><br>
An error is subsequently created in step 102. This type of error can, for example, be the presence of a short circuit in a conduit or be a defective sensor. It is, furthermore, possible that an actuator is not responding or not responding correctly. Creation of an error means in particular that a deviation is produced with regard to the size and effectiveness of one of the systems that is controlled by the control unit when compared to a model.<br>
Sensor values and actuating variables are then designated in step 103 and an intervention in the control unit is computed from this in an analysis program for an active chain diagnosis.<br>
Since the modelling program for the active chain diagnosis with regard to the functioning of the control unit, however, computes too slowly, the appropriate intervention time in the control unit is exceeded. The control unit is, therefore, reset i.e. re-initialised in a subsequent step 204 (beginning of the second run 200). Furthermore, the error memory of the control unit gets deleted and the starting condition (i.e. the working point originally selected in step 101) is re-established and started again respectively (step 201). It is to be noted that corresponding steps of the respective runs 100 - 400 exhibit the same last digits.<br>
The same error as in step 102 is now created in step 202 and the intervention computed by the active chain diagnosis in step 103 is executed in a subsequent step 205. With the data thus received, the active chain diagnosis can afterwards compute a second intervention in a subsequent step 203.<br>
The process presented is now executed in a third run 300 etc., whereby, as mentioned, same process steps are designated with the same end digits. It can be seen that two steps (305a, 305b) for execution of the computed runs are implemented in the third run.<br><br>
As many runs can be implemented as are required for the respective active chain diagnosis. Correspondingly, n steps (symbolically presented by 405a - 405n) result in the nth run, designated for execution of the computed interventions. A re-start of the control unit is only necessary when the active chain diagnosis reacts to the events and/or wants to intervene in the same. Since the re-start of the control unit can take place during computing of the active chain diagnosis, the process presented can be used in almost all error cases without requiring any additional time.<br>
The step sequence presented can be composed of only few groups of control signals for only few runs. A considerably higher number of runs can, however, also be provided, approximately in the range of up to ten, twenty, fifty or hundred. In the case of high-capacity computers, computing can also be executed for a number of runs in the range of thousands to ten thousand. The process in accordance with the invention differentiates itself from conventional regulations particularly in that a large number of runs can be executed in which, in each case, the start condition is re-established while a next intervention of the active chain diagnosis is being computed.<br>
In other words, the process in accordance with the invention repeats sequential steps: a control unit first emits start control signals for the establishment of a default operating condition, characterised by several operating parameters. The pre-determined deviation is subsequently imported into a system or the model representing the system and, based on this model, an actual operating condition is presented that is different from the default operating condition. The respective control signals are subsequently emitted successively in the sequence created previously in order to convert the system to the back-to-back actual operating conditions and/or present the back-to-back actual operating conditions.<br><br>
During and at the end of the sequence of control signals, the actual operating condition is received by sensor signals and/or emitted actuating variable signals and the sensor signals as well as the actuating variable signals are together fed simultaneously to a processing unit and control signals established in the processing unit from these signals, which will be added with the next run to the control signal sequence (run) at their end. Re-setting of the control unit always takes place in the default operating condition mentioned above, so that the control unit can, after each run, again emit start control signals for establishment of the default operating condition, characterised by several operating parameters.<br>
It is to be noted that the control signals can be fed at any time to a model of the system or to an actual system (e.g. a motor).<br><br>
