				<td>NUCLEOSIDES WITH ANTI-HEPATITIS B VIRUS ACTIVITY<br>
This invention is in the area of methods for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (also referred to as "HBV") that includes administering an effective amount of one or more of a P-L-2' or 3'-azido)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytosine to a host in need thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that it may directly trigger tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation, cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.<br>
Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. After a two to six month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed. Patients typically recover from acute viral hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid-1991, there were approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300 million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer. In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include those in contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is in fact very similar to that of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which accounts for why HBV infection is common among patients with AIDS or HIV-associated infections. However, HBV is more contagious than HIV.<br>
Daily treatments with a-interferon, a genetically engineered protein, has shown promise. A human serum-derived vaccine has also been developed to immunize patients against HBV.<br>
Vaccines have been produced through genetic engineering. While the vaccine has been found effective, production of the vaccine is troublesome because the supply of human serum from chronic carriers is limited, and the purification procedure is long and expensive. Further, each batch of vaccine prepared from different serum must be tested in chimpanzees to ensure safety. In addition, the vaccine does not help the patients already infected with the virus.<br>
A number of synthetic nucleosides have been identified which exhibit activity against HBV. The (-)-enantiomer of BCH-189 (2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine). known as 3TC. claimed in U. S. Patent 5,539,116 to Liotta, et al., is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis B. See also EPA 0 494 119 Al filed by BioChem Pharma, Inc.<br>

See Furman, et al., "The Anti-Hepatitis B Virus Activities, Cytotoxicities, and Anabolic Profiles of the (-) and (+) Enantiomers of cis-5-Fluoro-l-[2-(Hydroxymethyl)-l,3-oxathiolane-5-yl]-Cytosine" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, December 1992, page 2686-2692; and Cheng, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 267(20), 13938-13942 (1992).<br>

An essential step in the mode of action of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides against viral diseases, and in particular, HBV and HIV, is their metabolic activation by cellular and viral kinases, to yield the mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives. The biologically active species of many nucleosides is the triphosphate form, which inhibits DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase, or causes chain termination. The nucleoside derivatives that have been developed for the treatment of HBV and HIV to date have been presented for administration to the host in unphosphorylated form, notwithstanding the fact that the nucleoside must be phosphorylated in the cell prior to exhibiting its antiviral effect, because the triphosphate<br>
form has typically either been dephosphorylated prior to reaching the cell or is poorly absorbed by the cell. Nucleotides in general cross cell membranes very inefficiently and are generally not very not very potent in vitro. Attempts at modifying nucleotides to increase the absorption and potency of nucleotides have been described by R. Jones and N. Bischofberger, Antiviral Research, 27 (1995) 1 -17.<br>
In light of the fact that hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide, and has severe and often tragic effects on the infected patient, there remains a strong need to provide new effective pharmaceutical agents to treat humans infected with the virus that have low toxicity to the host.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment of human patients or other hosts infected with HBV.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A method for the treatment of HBV infection in humans and other host animals is disclosed that includes administering an effective amount of a P-L-(2' or 3'-azido)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytosine nucleoside or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof, including a stabilized phosphate, administered either alone or in combination or alternation with another anti-HBV agent, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the 2' or 3'-azido group is in the ribosyl configuration. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleoside is provided as the indicated enantiomer and substantially in the absence of its corresponding ß-D-enantiomer.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound is ß-L-(2'-azido)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytosine (L-2'-A-5-FddC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, salt or prodrug thereof of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is H, acyl, monophosphate, diphosphate, or triphosphate, or a stabilized phosphate derivative (to form a stabilized nucleotide prodrug), and R' is H, acyi, or alkyl.<br>
In another embodiment, the active compound is ß-L-(3'-azido)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytosine ( L-3'-A-5-FddC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, salt or prodrug thereof of the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R is H, acyl, monophosphate, diphosphate, or triphosphate, or a stabilized phosphate derivative (to form a stabilized nucleotide prodrug), and R' is H, acyl, or alkyl.<br>
The disclosed nucleosides, or their pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, esters or salts or pharmaceutically acceptable formulations containing these compounds are useful in the prevention and treatment of HBV infections and other related conditions such as anti-HBV antibody positive and HBV-positive conditions, chronic liver inflammation caused by HBV, cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis, and fatigue. These compounds or formulations can also be used prophylactically to prevent or retard the progression of clinical illness in individuals who are anti-HBV antibody or HBV-antigen positive or who have been exposed to HBV.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention includes a method for the treatment of humans infected with HBV that includes administering an HBV treatment amount of a prodrug of the specifically disclosed L-(2' or 3')-A-5-FddC nucleosides. A prodrug, as used herein, refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of the specifically disclosed nucleoside, that is converted into the nucleoside on administration in vivo, or that has activity in itself. Nonlimiting examples are the 5' and N4-cytosine acylated or alkylated derivatives of the active compound, as well as the 5'-monophosphate, diphosphate, or triphosphate derivatives,<br>
other phosphates, or stablized nucleotide prodrugs, as described in more detail below. For example, the nucleoside is provided as the monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate in a formulation that protects the compound from dephosphorylation. Formulations include liposomes, lipospheres, microspheres or nanospheres (of which the latter three can be targeted to infected cells).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, one or more of the active compounds is administered in alternation or combination with one or more other anti-HBV agents, to provide effective anti-HBV treatment. Examples of anti-HBV agents that can be used in alternation or combination therapy include but are not limited to the cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane, preferably substantially in the form of the (-)-optical isomer ("FTC", see WO 92/14743); the (-)-enantiomer of cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (3TC); ß-D-l,3-dioxolane purine nucleosides as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,444,063 and 5,684,010; carbovir, interferon penciclovir and famciclovir.<br>
Any method of alternation can be used that provides treatment to the patient. Nonlimiting examples of alternation patterns include 1-6 weeks of administration of an effective amount of one agent followed by 1-6 weeks of administration of an effective amount of a second anti-HBV agent. The alternation schedule can include periods of no treatment. Combination therapy generally includes the simultaneous administration of an effective ratio of dosages of two or more anti-HBV agents.<br>
In light of the fact that HBV is often found in patients who are also anti-HIV antibody or HIV-antigen positive or who have been exposed to HIV, the active anti-HBV compounds disclosed herein or their derivatives or prodrugs can be administered in the appropriate circumstance in combination or alternation with anti-HIV medications.<br>
The second antiviral agent for the treatment of HIV, in one embodiment, can be a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (a "RTI"), which can be either a synthetic nucleoside (a "NRTI") or a non-nucleoside compound (a "NNRTI"). In an alternative embodiment, in the case of HIV, the second (or third) antiviral agent can be a protease inhibitor. In other embodiments, the second (or third) compound can be a pyrophosphate analog, or a fusion binding inhibitor. A list compiling resistance data collected in vitro and in vivo for a number of antiviral compounds is found in Schinazi, et al, Mutations in retroviral genes associated with drug resistance, International Antiviral News, Volume 1(4), International Medical Press 1996.<br>
Preferred examples of antiviral agents that can be used in combination or alternation with<br>
the compounds disclosed herein for HBV therapy include 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (FTC); the (-)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (3TC); carbovir, acyclovir, interferon, L-FMAU, and P-D-dioxolane nucleosides such as ß-D-dioxolanyl-guanine (DXG), ß-D-dioxolanyl-2,6-diaminopurine (DAPD), and ß-D-dioxolanyl-6-chloropurine (ACP), L-FDDC (5-fluoro-3'-thia-2',3'-dideoxycytidine), L-enantiomers of 3'-fluoro-modified p-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates, famciclovir, penciclovir, bis-Pom PMEA (adefovir, dipivoxil); lobucavir, ganciclovir, and ribavarin.<br>
The active anti-HBV can also be administered in combination with amibioucs, other antiviral compounds, antifungal agents, or other pharmaceutical agents administered for the treatment of secondary infections.<br>

Structure and Preparation of Active Nucieosides<br>
Stereochemistry<br>
Since the 1' and 4' carbons of the sugar (referred to below generically as the sugar moiety) of the nucleosides are chiral, their nonhydrogen substituents (CH2OR and the pyrimidine or purine base, respectively) can be either cis (on the same side) or trans (on opposite sides) with respect to the sugar ring system. The four optical isomers therefore are represented by the following configurations (when orienting the sugar moiety in a horizontal plane such that the "primary" oxygen (that between the Cl' and C4'-atoms is in back): "ß" or "cis" (with both groups "up", which corresponds to the configuration of naturally occurring nucleosides, i.e., the D configuration), "P" or cis (with both groups "down", which is a nonnaturally occurring configuration, i.e., the L configuration), "a "or "trans" (with the C2 substituent "up" and the C5 substituent "down"), and "α " or trans (with the C2 substituent "down" and the C5 substituent "up").<br>
The active nucleosides of the present invention are in the ß-L-configuration, with the azido group in the ribosyl configuration. Prodrug Formulations<br>
The nucleosides disclosed herein can be administered as any derivative that upon administration to the recipient, is capable of providing directly or indirectly, the parent active compound, or that exhibits activity in itself. In one embodiment, the hydrogen of the 5'-OH group is replaced by a C1-C20 alkyl; acyl including those in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the ester group is selected from straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C20 alkyl, phenyl, or benzyl; a naturally occurring or nonnaturally occurring amino acid; a S'-ether lipid or a 5'-<br>
phosphoether lipid; alkoxyaikyl including methoxymethyl; aralkyl including benzyl; aryloxyalkyl such as phenoxymethyl; aryl including phenyl optionally substituted with halogen, C1 to C4 alkyl or C1 to C4 alkoxy; a dicarboxylic acid such as succinic acid; sulfonate esters such as alkyl or aralkyl sulphonyl including methanesulfonyl; or a mono, di or triphosphate ester.<br>
One or both hydrogens of the amino groups on the purine or pyrimidine base can be replaced by a C1-C20 alkyl; acyl in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the ester group is selected from straight, branched, or cyclic C1-C20 alkyl, phenyl, or benzyl; alkoxyaikyl including methoxymethyl; aralkyl including benzyl;' aryloxyalkyl such as phenoxymethyl; aryl including phenyl optionally substituted with halogen, C1 to C4 alkyl or C1 to C4 alkoxy.<br>
The active nucleoside can also be provided as a 5'-ether lipid, as disclosed in the following references: Kucera, L.S., N. Iyer, E. Leake, A. Raben, Modest E.J., D. L.W., and C. Piantadosi. 1990.

Any of the nucleosides described herein can be administered as a nucleotide prodrug or phospholipid prodrug to increase the activity, bioavailability, stability or otherwise alter the properties of the nucleoside. A number of nucleotide prodrug ligands are known. In general, alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono, di or triphosphoate of the nucleoside will increase the stability of the nucleotide. Examples of substituent groups that can replace one or more hydrogens on the the phosphate moiety are alkyl, aryl, steroids,<br><br>
carbohydrates, including sugars, 1,2-diacylglycerol and alcohols. Many are described in R. Jones and N. Bischofberger, Antiviral Research, 27(1995) 1-17. Any of these can be used in combination with the disclosed nucleosides to achieve a desired effect. Nonlimiting examples of nucleotide prodrugs are described in the following references.<br>

The ability of P-L-( 2' or 3'-azido)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytosine compounds to inhibit the replication of HBV in a host can be evaluated according to any known method, including that below.<br>
The antiviral evaluations were performed on two separate passages of cells, two cultures per passage (4 cultures total). All wells, in all plates, were seeded at the same density and at the same time.<br>
Due to the inherent variations in the levels of both intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA, only depressions greater than 3.0-fold (for HBV virion DNA) or 2.5-fold (for HBV DNA replication intermediates) from the average levels for these HBV DNA forms in untreated cells are generally considered to be statistically significant [P
to calculate the levels of intracellular HBV DNA forms, thereby eliminating technical variations inherent in the blot hybridization assays.<br>
Typical values for extracellular HBV virion DNA in untreated cells range from 50 to 150 pg/ml culture medium (average of approximately 76 pg/ml). Intracellular HBV DNA replication intermediates in untreated cells range from 50 to 100 pg/ug cell DNA (average approximately 74 pg/ug cell DNA). In general, depressions in the levels of intracellular HBV DNA due to treatment with antiviral compounds are less pronounced, and occur more slowly, than depressions in the levels of HBV virion DNA.<br>
For reference, the manner in which the hybridization analyses were performed for these experiments results in an equivalence of approximately 1.0 pg intracellular HBV DNA/ug cellular DNA to 2-3 genomic copies per cell and 1.0 pg of extracellular HBV DNA/ml culture medium to 3 x 105 viral particles/ml.<br>
Toxicity analyses were performed in order to assess whether any observed antiviral effects were due to a general effect on cell viability. This can be assessed by the uptake of neutral red dye, a standard and widely used assay for cell viability in a variety of virus-host systems, including HSV (herpes simplex virus) and HIV.<br>
The test compounds were used in the form of stock solutions in DMSO (frozen on dry ice). Daily aliquots of the test samples were made and frozen at -20°C so that each individual aliquot would be subjected to a single freeze-thaw cycle. The daily test aliquots were thawed, suspended into culture medium at room temperature and immediately added to the cell cultures. The results are provided in Table 1.<br>

Example 3 Toxicity Of Compounds<br>
The ability of the active compounds to inhibit the growth of virus in 2.2.15 cell cultures (HepG2 cells transformed with hepatitis virion) was evaluated. As illustrated in Table 1, no significant toxicity (greater than 50% depression of the dye uptake levels observed in untreated cells) was observed for any of the test compounds at the concentrations 100 mM.<br>
Toxicity analyses were performed in 96-well flat bottomed tissue culture plates. Cells for the toxicity analyses were cultured and treated with test compounds with the same schedule as used for the antiviral evaluations. Each compound was tested at 4 concentrations, each in triplicate cultures. Uptake of neutral red dye was used to determine the relative level of toxicity. The absorbance of internalized dye at 510 nM (Asio) was used for the quantitative analysis. Values are presented as a percentage of the average A510 values (± standard deviations) in 9 separate cultures of untreated cells maintained on the same 96-well plate as the test compounds. The percentage of dye uptake in the 9 control cultures on plate 40 was 100 ± 3. At 150-190 µM B-D-ddC, a 2-fold reduction in dye uptake (versus the levels observed in untreated cultures) is typically observed in these assays (Korba and Gerin, Antiviral Res. 19: 55-70,1992).<br>
