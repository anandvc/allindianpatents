				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a highly stable supported catalyst which exhibits high reactivity and selectivity in a wide variety of organic reactions. More specifically, the present invention relates to a supported catalyst which comprises a support, an anchoring agent and a metal complex, wherein the anchoring agent is a heteropoly acid, its lacunar or other crystalline or non crystalline phases or their anions. Such a supported catalyst is particularly useful for, but not limited to, the chiral hydrogenation of substituted a,ß unsaturated acids or esters and a- or ß-ketoesters or lactones. Various methods of preparing the supported catalyst of the present invention are also provided herein.<br>
Catalytic processes using either homogeneous catalysts, i.e. those present in the same phase as the reactants or heterogeneous catalysts, i.e. those present as a separate phase in the reaction medium, have played an important role in organic synthesis.<br><br>
-2-<br>
Heterogeneous catalysts are insoluble; thus they can be readily separated from the reaction mixture and, generally, offer the potential for ready re-use. Despite these advantages, prior art heterogeneous<br>
catalysts are rather limited in the number and types <br><br>
of organic reactions in which they can be used. In <br>
addition, they are usually less selective than homogeneous catalysts which are typically soluble metal salts or metal complexes. Indeed, homogeneous catalysts are not only more selective than heterogeneous catalysts, but have been used to promote a wider variety of organic reactions. Nevertheless, difficulties can be encountered in separating the soluble, homogeneous catalyst, both the metal and the accompanying ligands, from the product. This not only presents problems with the purity of the product, but also makes the re-use of the homogeneous catalyst problematic. The potential loss of the ligand is particularly serious in enantioselective reactions where chiral ligands are usually quite expensive.<br>
Over the past twenty-five years, attempts have been made to "heterogenize" the more versatile homogeneous catalysts, the primary aim being to maintain reaction activity and selectivity of the homogeneous species while at the same time significantly increasing the ease of separation from the reaction medium. One such approach' to achieve "heterogenization" involves reacting a metal complex or salt with a solid support such as a polymer or a metal oxide which had been previously modified by the addition of phosphine or amine ligands to the surface of the support. Catalysis Reviews 16, 17-37 (1974)<br><br>
-3-<br>
and Chemical Reviews, ,81, 109 (1981) are reviews of the earlier literature concerned with polymer supported complexes. Tetrahedron: Asvmmetry. 6., 1109-1116 (1995), Tetrahedron Letters. 12,-3375-3378 (1996) and Chemische Berichte, 129. 815-821 (1996) are examples of recent references in this area. From a practical approach, these catalysts are not widely used since their activities are frequently lower than those of the corresponding homogeneous analogs. In addition, problems associated with polymer swelling and attendant mass transport difficulties can be encountered, as well as the finding that activity is frequently lost on attempted re-use. Some success has been reported in preparing polymer supported chiral complexes, but the selectivity observed with the use of such "heterogenized" species has generally been lower than that obtained using the homogeneous catalyst itself.<br>
"Catalysis by Supported Complexes", Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, Volume 8, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1981 is an extensive review of the earlier work concerned with the anchoring of metal complexes onto surface modified oxides. Journal of Catalysis, 157, 436-449 (1995) and Bulletin Societe de Chemie, France, 133, 351-357 (1996) are some more recent references. While these materials do not manifest significant swelling problems associated with the use of polymer supports, there are frequent reports of loss of activity on attempted re-use.<br><br>
-4-<br>
In rare instances, the oxide support does not have to be modified before the application of a metal complex. Journal of Molecular Catalysis, 88, <br>
13-22 (1994) describes the interaction of <br>
 Rh(OH) (CO) (PPh3)2 with an alumina surface to give a <br>
supported catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes <br><br>
and benzene. This report also states that the <br>
presence of the Rh-OH entity is necessary for <br>
interaction with the surface of the alumina and that<br>
other complexes could not be attached to the oxide <br>
surface.	<br>
Another problem associated with prior art catalysts made from metal complexes which are attached to either a modified polymer or metal oxide surface is that their preparation techniques are rather specific and are driven by the nature of the ligand to be attached. Hence, modification of the catalyst to introduce another, more selective ligand is usually an arduous and complex task, if it is one that can be accomplished at all. This circumstance has particular importance where the preparation of enantioselective catalysts are concerned since optimal enantiomeric excess is usually obtained using a specific ligand or class of ligands for a given reaction or substrate.<br>
Journal of Catalysis. 152, 25-30 (1995) describes the preparation of chiral, supported aqueous phase catalysts and their use in the preparation of naproxen. These heterogeneous catalysts have the same enantioselectivity as the homogeneous counterpart, but are 2 to 2.5 times less active.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Heteropoly acids have long been used as<br>
solid acid catalysts and have been supported on<br>
various solid supports for use in this way. For<br>
instance, Chemistry Letters, 663 (1981) and Applied<br>
Catalysis 24, 191-204 (1991) describe the use of<br>
heteropoly acids supported on carbon as solid acid<br>
catalysts, while Journal of Catalysis. 84, 402-409.<br>
(1983), Journal of Catalysis. 125, 45-53 (1990) and<br>
Microporous Materials. 5, 255-262 (1995) describe the<br>
use of silica as a support for heteropoly acids.<br>
Journal of Molecular Catalysis. 2i, 23-33 (1992)	<br>
describes the pillaring of anionic clays by heteropoly<br>
acids.	<br>
It has been known for some time that<br>
interaction of a heteropoly acid with a metal salt can provide catalysts that are useful for a number of different oxidation and related reactions in which the redox properties of the heteropoly acid play an important role. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,448,892 and Journal of Catalysis. 154, 175-186<br>
(1995) describe the use of such catalysts, where the same are prepared using a palladium salt, for the oxidation of alkenes to aldehydes or ketones. Similar catalysts have also been used for the carbonylation of alkenes as described in Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 62, 161,737 [Chemical Abstracts, 108, 131037 (1988)]. The carbonylation of nitro aromatics is described in Chemistry Letters. 795-796 (1990) and Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 03, 93,765 [Chemical Abstracts, 115, 182846 (1991)] while alkane and alkene oxidations are described in Chemical Communications. 1324-1325<br>
(1989) .<br><br>
-6-<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,116,796 and 5,250,739 as well as Inorganic Chemistry. 34, 1413-1429 (1995) describe the formation of soluble iridium-heteropoly acid complexes which have been used to promote alkene hydrogenations and oxidations.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,590,298 describes the use of soluble rhodium cyclopentadiene complexes in combination with heteropoly acids for the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide with formaldehyde to give C4-C5 hydroxy ketones.<br>
Chemistry Letters, 1595 (1985) describes the interaction of RhCl(PPh3)3 with Li4SiMo12O40 to give a soluble catalyst for the semihydrogenation of methyl phenyl acetylene.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,673,753 and Inorganic Chemistry. 29, 1667-1673 (1990) describe the combination of rhodium carbonyl phosphine complexes with heteropoly acids. The substances prepared are insoluble in toluene so the catalytic reactions are run in this solvent to maintain a heterogeneous catalyst system. These species are used to catalyze the oxidation of CO by NO, the isomerization of 1-hexene and the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. There is no report on the re-use of these catalysts.<br>
Despite the current state of the art, there is a continuing need to develop stable heterogeneous catalysts which employ an active metal complex on an insoluble support, which catalysts are highly reactive and selective in organic reactions. Indeed, a particular need exists for the development of such<br><br>
-7-<br>
catalysts which contain a chiral metal entity capable of promoting an enantioselective reaction. The term "chiral metal entity" is used herein to denote metal complexes which contain at least one chiral ligand.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to a supported catalyst which comprises the following catalyst components: (i) a particulate support; e.g. an inorganic oxide or carbon; (ii) an "anchoring agent"; and (iii) a metal complex. By "anchoring agent" is meant a heteropoly acid, its lacunar or other crystalline or non-crystalline phase material or their anions. By "metal complex" is meant any catalytically active material which contains at least one transition metal atom or ion from Group IIIB, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB, VIII, IB or IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements to which one or more ligands are attached. The ligands can be species containing, for instance, phosphorous, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, halogen or atoms having an electron pair, as well as carbonyls, alkenes and dienes or other moieties which can coordinate with the transition metal atom or ion.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of preparing the aforementioned supported catalyst. In accordance with this aspect of the present invention, the supported catalyst is prepared by the following steps:<br>
(i) contacting a support with a heteropoly acid or anion under conditions effective to form a<br><br>
-8-<br>
heteropoly acid or anion-containing support;<br>
(ii) contacting a metal complex with said heteropoly acid or anion-containing support under conditions effective to form a supported catalyst;<br>
(iii) activating the catalyst be either first use in the reactor or by a reduction step such as a prehydrogenation; and<br>
(iv) optionally, recovering said supported catalyst from.<br>
In accordance with a second method of the <br>
present invention, the supported catalyst is obtained <br>
by the following steps:	<br>
(i) contacting a heteropoly acid or anion with a metal complex under conditions effective to form a solution or suspension containing said heteropoly acid or anion and said metal complex;<br>
(ii) contacting a support with said solution or suspension prepared in step (i) under conditions effective to form a supported catalyst;<br>
{iii) activating the catalyst be either first use in a reactor or by a reduction step such as a prehydrogenation; and<br>
(iv) optionally, recovering said supported catalyst from.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of forming a supported catalyst which comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) contacting a support with a heteropoly<br><br>
-9-<br>
acid or anion under conditions effective to form a modified support comprising the heteropoly acid or anion;<br>
(ii) contacting a catalytic precursor<br>
material with said support produced in step (i) under conditions effective to form a supported catalyst precursor;<br>
(iii) contacting the supported catalyst precursor with a ligand under conditions effective to prepare a catalytically active supported catalyst;<br>
(iv) activating the catalyst be either first use in a reactor or by a reduction step such as prehydrogenation; and<br>
(v) optionally, recovering said supported catalyst from.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the supported catalyst can be used to promote a wide variety of organic reactions which include, but are not limited to: hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, isomerizations, carbonylations, hydrogenolyses, hydroformylations, oxidations, carboxylations, aminations, silylations, carboalkoxylations, cyclopropanations, alkylations, allylations, arylations and other carbon - carbon bond forming reactions. These reactions can be run in either the vapor phase or in solution. Further, they can be run in either a batch mode or in a continuous process.<br>
Of particular importance is the use of the chiral supported catalyst of the present invention for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral<br><br>
-10-<br>
compounds such as substituted a, 3 unsaturated acids or esters and a- or 3-ketoesters or lactones.<br>
A related process involves the use of the supported catalyst of the present invention to promote the hydroformylation of alkenes into aldehydes and/or alcohols in the presence of CO and H2 under conditions which are sufficient to convert said alkene into the corresponding aldehyde and/or alcohol.<br>
Fig. 1 is a plot of the hydrogen uptake curves for the hydrogenation of 2 acetamidocinnamic acid methyl ester using a Rh(Me-DUPHOS)(COD) catalyst supported on a phosphotungstic acid modified carbon support prepared in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As stated hereinabove, the present invention allows a homogeneous catalyst to be supported with high activity, selectivity and stability in a wide variety of organic reactions. Specifically, the catalyst of the present invention comprises the following three components: an insoluble support, an anchoring agent (a heteropoly acid, its lacunar or other crystalline or non-crystalline phases or their anions), and a metal complex. The supported catalyst of the present invention is stable in air while retaining or even surpassing the activity and selectivity of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst; but, being insoluble, it is easily removed from the reaction mixture and is thus capable of extended re-<br><br>
-11-<br>
use. Moreover, the supported catalyst of the present invention quite unexpectedly exhibits an increase in reactivity and selectivity after re-use. Thus, the supported catalyst of the present invention is highly useful in a wide variety of applications including, but not limited to, pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications.<br>
The support is a particulate amorphous or crystalline material having a sufficient surface area to facilitate uniform distribution of the anchoring agent thereon. A particle size is selected to afford easy separability from the reaction media, and may typically range from 100-200 mesh.<br>
The supported catalyst of the present invention can be made using any of the following methods. In the first method, a support is contacted with a heteropoly acid or anion under conditions which are effective to form a support which contains the heteropoly acid or anion.<br>
Suitable supports include, but are not limited to: metal oxides such as alumina, silica, titania, zirconia, lanthana, zeolites and clays, as well as carbon, resins, polymers and the like. The support may be used as is, or it may be treated prior to use to remove unwanted species which may adversely effect the activity of the catalyst. For example, the support may be calcined either in air or in an inert atmosphere prior to use.<br>
The interaction between the anchoring agent and the support may be effected by reaction as<br><br>
-12-<br>
discussed below; but it is to be understood that the anchoring agent may be bonded to or intercalated by the support solely by physical and/or chemical attractive forces based upon van der waals forces, donor/ acceptor interactions and other surface phenomena.<br>
Another method of treating the support<br>
involves the use of a modifier which has been found to increase the adhesion of the heteropoly acid or anion to the support. Suitable modifiers that may be employed in the present invention for this purpose include, but are not limited to: metal alkoxides such as titanium alkoxide, aluminum alkoxide, silane alkoxide, vanadium alkoxide and the like; polyisocyanates, hydroxy epoxides, cyano epoxides and other functionalized organic materials. Of the aforementioned modifiers, metal alkoxides are particularly preferred.<br>
When a modifier is employed in the present invention, the modifier is contacted with the support in a solvent at a temperature of from about 25° to about 250°C for a period of time of from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. The amount of modifier employed in the present invention varies depending upon the type of support being employed. Typically, however, the modifier is present in about 0.01% to about 100% by weight of the support employed in the present invention.<br>
As stated above, the support, either treated or nontreated, is then contacted with a heteropoly acid or anion. The heteropoly acids employed in the<br><br>
-13-<br>
present invention are conventional heteropoly acids well known to those skilled in the art. The term "heteropoly acid" is used herein to denote any polyprotic mixed oxide which is generally composed of a central ion or ions bonded to an appropriate number of oxygen atoms and surrounded by a near spherical shell of octahedral oxometal species joined together by shared oxygen atoms. The central atom or "heteroatom" is typically a cation having a +3 to +5 oxidation state such as P+s, As+5, Si+4 or Mn+4. The metal species associated with the octahedra are usually Mo, W or V. The octahedra in the shell of the heteropoly acid can be of uniform composition or contain different metal species.<br>
As discussed in "Zeolites, Clays and<br>
Heteropoly Acids in Organic Synthesis", Chapter 3, VCH Publishers, New York, 1992, suitable heteropoly acids include, but are not limited to: Keggin species such as phosphotungstic acid (PTA), phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), silicotungstic acid (STA) and the like; Dawson species; Waugh species; Anderson species; Silverton species; their lacunar and other crystalline or non-crystalline forms; and anions of the preceding. When anions are used, the counterions can be, but are not limited to: alkali, alkali earth or quaternary ammonium ions.<br>
Contact of the support and the heteropoly acid or anion generally occurs in a solvent at a temperature of from about -25° to about 250°C for a time period of from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. Preferably, this occurs at temperatures of between<br><br>
-14-<br>
about 25° and about 75°C for periods of between 3 and 12 hours. Typically, in the present invention the heteropoly acid or its anion is present in a weight ratio with the support of from about 0.01:1 to about 20:1. This contact step may occur in air or it may be carried out in an inert atmosphere.<br>
In accordance with the next step of the present invention, the heteropoly acid or anion-containing support is contacted with a metal complex under conditions which are effective to form a supported catalyst. By "metal complex" is meant any catalytically active material which contains at least one transition metal atom or ion from Group IIIB, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB, VIII, IB or IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements to which one or more ligands are attached. Suitable transition metal atoms or ions include: Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn and the like. Preferably, the metal complex will contain a metal atom or ion from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements; e.g., Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd and Pt.<br>
The ligands can be species containing, for instance, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, halogen or atoms having a free electron pair, as well as carbonyls, alkenes and dienes or other moieties which can coordinate with the metal atom or ion. Suitable achiral ligands which may be employed in the present invention include, but are not limited to: species such as cyclopentadiene, carbon monoxide, cyclooctadiene (COD) and tertiary phosphines. Suitable chiral ligands which may be employed in the<br><br>
-15-<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to: species such as (R,R) or (S,S) 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)1,1'-binaphthyl (BINAP), (2S,3S)-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (CHIRAPHOS), 2,3-O-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (DIOP), (R,R)-1,2-bis [ (2 -methoxyphenyl)phenylphosphino] ethane (DIPAMP) , 1,2-bis(2R,5R) -2,5- (dimethylphospholano)benzene (Me-DUPHOS) and (R) 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (PROPHOS). Mixtures of these ligands such as (COD)(Me-DUPHOS) are also contemplated herein. The use of chiral ligands is particularly preferred in the present invention for promoting enantioselective reactions.<br>
Examples of metal complexes contemplated by the present invention include, but are not limited to: Rh(COD) (DIPAMP)BF4, Pd (R, R-BINAP) Cla, Rh(COD) (Me-DUPHOS) Cl and the like. In addition to metal complexes, other catalytically active compounds containing a Group VIII metal are also contemplated herein. Examples of such catalytically active compounds include, but are not limited to: the elemental Group VIII metals, Group VIII metal salts, and the like.<br>
The contacting step between the heteropoly acid or anion-containing support and the metal complex typically occurs in a solvent and at a temperature of from about -25° to about 250°C for a time period of from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. Preferably this contacting takes place at temperatures of between about 25° and about 50°C for a time period of between<br><br>
-16-<br>
about 1 hr and about 3 hrs. Generally in the present invention, the metal complex is employed at a concentration such that the metal complex to heteropoly acid or anion molar ratio is from about, 0.1:1 to about 6:1; more preferably, from about 0.5:1 to about 1.5:1; and most preferably from about 0.75:1 to about 1:1.<br>
The solvents employed in various steps of the present invention may be the same or different, and are those which are capable of dissolving the anchoring agent and/or the metal complexes. A preferred solvent is methanol, but other alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, hexanol, heptanol and the like, as well as water, ethers, esters, ketones and aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, may also be employed in the present invention. The solvent may be employed as is, or it may be purified by techniques well known in the art prior to its use. For example, the solvent can be distilled and then passed over a bed or column containing an appropriate adsorbent material.<br>
The solid supported catalyst of the present invention may then be activated either by first use in a reactor or by a reduction step such as a prehydrogenation.<br>
The solid supported catalyst of the present invention may then be optionally recovered using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the solid catalyst may be recovered by decantation, filtration or centrifugation. The recovered solid catalyst may be used as is, or it may<br><br>
-17-<br>
be washed with one of the aforementioned solvents prior to use to remove any anchoring agent or metal complex that is not bound to the support. The supported catalyst can then be dried.<br>
In accordance with the second method of preparing the supported catalyst of the present invention, the anchoring agent mentioned hereinabove is contacted first with a metal complex to form a solution or suspension and then that solution or suspension is contacted with a support.<br>
The contact between the anchoring agent and the metal complex typically occurs in a solvent at a temperature of from about -25° to about 250°C for a period of time of from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. Preferably, this contact takes place at temperatures of between about 25° to about 60°C for periods of time from about 15 min to about 1 hr. Generally the metal complex is employed at a concentration such that the metal complex to anchoring agent molar ratio is from about 0.1:1 to about 6:1; more preferably, from about 0.5:1 to about 1.5:1; and most preferably from about 0.75:1 to about 1:1.<br>
The resulting solution or suspension<br>
containing the anchoring agent and the metal complex may be used as is, or, in another embodiment of the present invention, the resulting solution or suspension is dried and then slurried in a comparable solvent prior to contacting with the metal complex. The solvents employed in this embodiment of the present invention are the same as those previously mentioned hereinabove.<br><br>
-18-<br>
The solution or suspension containing the anchoring agent and metal complex is then contacted with one of the supports mentioned above. This contact between the solution or suspension and the support generally occurs in a solvent at a temperature of from about -25° to about 250°C for a period of time from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. Preferably, this contacting takes place at a temperature of about 25°C to about 60°C for a period of time from about 3 hrs to about 12 hrs. In accordance with this aspect of the present invention, the anchoring agent and metal complex solution or suspension is present in about 0.01% to about 150% by weight of the support employed in this contacting step. The thus formed supported catalyst is, optionally, recovered as previously described.<br>
The activation by prehydrogenation can be accomplished by stirring the supported catalyst under hydrogen typically at temperatures between ambient and 50°C and at pressures between 1 and 10 atm. for an appropriate amount of time to achieve activation.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a supported catalyst is prepared by first contacting a support with an anchoring agent as described hereinabove. The support containing the anchoring agent is then contacted with a catalyst precursor material under conditions which are effective for forming a supported catalyst precursor.<br>
By "catalyst precursor material" is meant any metal salt or complex which is used to prepare a catalytically active entity. Examples of suitable<br><br>

catalyst precursors include, but are not limited to, rhodium cyclooctadiene dimer, ruthenium cyclooctadiene dimer, allyl palladium dimer, rhodium chloride and the like.<br>
The contacting of the anchoring agent-containing support and the catalyst precursor typically occurs in a solvent at a temperature of from about -25° to about 250°C for a time period of from about 1 min. to about 50 hrs. Preferably this contacting takes place at temperatures of between about 25° and about 50°C for periods of between about 1 hr to about 3 hrs. Generally in the present invention, the catalyst precursor material is employed at a concentration such that the precursor to anchoring agent molar ratio is from about 0.1:1 to about 6:1; more preferably, from about 0.5:1 to about 1.5:1; and most preferably from about 0.75:1 to about 1:1. The catalyst supported precursor, optionally, may be washed and dried prior to treatment with a ligand.<br>
The thus formed catalyst supported precursor is then contacted with a ligand which forms a catalytically active entity. It is noted that the catalyst supported precursor itself may or may not be catalytically active. It is, however, converted to a catalytically active entity by contacting it with a suitable ligand. The ligands employed for this purpose include those ligands mentioned hereinabove.<br>
The concentration of the ligand which is added to the catalyst supported precursor is typically from about 1 to about 6 mmol per mmol of catalyst<br><br>
-20-<br>
precursor material. The treatment of the catalyst supported precursor and the ligand typically occurs in a solvent at temperatures of from about -25° to about 250°C for periods of from about 1 min to about 50 hrs.<br>
It should be mentioned that all of the above contacting steps may be conducted in air or they may be done in hydrogen or in an inert gas atmosphere, as appropriate. The activation by prehydrogenation is carried out using the conditions mentioned<br>
hereinabove,	<br><br>
The above description illustrates the methods which can be used in forming the supported catalyst of the present invention. It is emphasized that all three catalyst components of the present invention, i.e. the support, the anchoring agent, and the metal complex are needed for optimum catalytic activity, stability and selectivity. Catalysts not containing all three catalyst components of the present invention exhibit inferior results. For example, while catalysts prepared without the presence of the anchoring agent may sometimes show activity, the stability and activity in all cases is significantly lower than that of the supported catalyst of the present invention. In an appropriate solvent the heteropoly acid-metal complex product without the support may appear to be insoluble. While this material may be used as a heterogeneous catalyst a portion of the catalytically active species does dissolve resulting in a loss of catalyst.<br>
The supported catalyst of the present invention imparts improved catalytic properties such<br><br>
-21-<br>
as catalytic activity, stability and selectivity as compared to the corresponding homogeneous catalyst or as to catalytic species prepared only from a heteropoly acid and a metal complex. Moreover, the supported catalyst of the present invention advantageously and unexpectedly exhibits an increase in catalytic activity and selectivity when the catalyst is re-used. Without wishing to be bound by any theory it is thought that the observed increase in activity and selectivity when compared to the soluble species is the result of changes in the steric environment of the active metal in the supported moiety. Increases in stability may be brought about by the presence of the anchoring agent.<br>
The catalyst itself comprises a relatively uniform distribution of active catalytic sites formed about the supporting particles, but remote therefrom to the extent of the selected anchoring agent bridge. This shell of active sites may typically be present at a distance, for example, 10-14 A from the support particle itself, thereby affording excellent accessibility to reactants.<br>
A further advantage of the supported catalyst of the present invention is that it is insoluble; and leaching of the metal, which is common with prior art supported homogeneous catalysts, is not observed.<br>
In view of the above advantages, the supported catalyst of the present invention can be used to promote a wide variety of organic reactions which include, but are not limited to: hydrogenations,<br><br>
-22-<br>
dehydrogenations, isomerizations, carbonylations, hydrogenolyses, hydroformylations, oxidations, carboxylations, aminations, silylations, carboalkoxylations, cyclopropanations, alkylations, allylations, arylations and other carbon carbon bond forming reactions. These reactions can be run in either the vapor phase or in solution. Further, they can be run in either a batch mode or in a continuous process using conditions well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the supported catalyst of the present invention is employed in hydrogenating substituted a,ß unsaturated acids or esters or other prochiral substrates. In accordance with this aspect of the present invention, a substituted a,ß unsaturated acid or ester having the formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are the same or<br>
different and are hydrogen, alkyl containing from 1 to about 3 5 carbon atoms, alkenyl containing from 1 to about 3 5 carbon atoms, alkynyl containing from 1 to about 3 5 carbon atoms, aryl containing from about 6 to about 18 carbon atoms, amine, amide, or alkoxide containing from about 1 to about 35 carbon atoms, and R is hydrogen or alkyl having from about 1 to about 35 carbon atoms, is contacted with a supported catalyst<br><br>
-23-<br>
of the present invention in the presence of H2 under conditions which are effective to selectively hydrogenate the substituted a,ß unsaturated acid or ester into a desired product. It is noted that the above substituents may be straight or branched as well as being unsubstituted or substituted with one of the substituents mentioned hereinabove. The aryl substituents may also be bicyclic or fused species.<br>
Of particular interest is the<br>
enantioselective hydrogenation of those compounds in which R3 is not hydrogen or R1 is different from R2 and neither is hydrogen. Hydrogenation of these prochiral substrates over a chiral supported catalyst of the present invention leads to the selective formation of one of the enantiomers of the product.<br>
Preferred substituted a,ß unsaturated acids or esters contemplated by the present invention include, but are not limited to: 2-acetamidocinnamic acid methyl ester, 2-acetamidocinnamic acid, 2-acetamidoacrylic acid methyl ester, 2-acetamidoacrylic acid, dimethylitaconate, itaconic acid, 2-methylpentenoic acid, 2-methylhexenoic acid, and 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)acrylic acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the supported catalyst of the present invention is employed in hydrogenating carbonyl groups, particularly prochiral ketones, a-ketoesters, a- ketolactones or ß-ketoesters.<br>
The hydrogenation conditions employed in the present invention are those that are typically employed in the prior art for carrying out such a<br><br>
-24-<br>
reaction.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a process for hydroformylating alkenes into their corresponding aldehydes and/or alcohols is provided. In accordance with this aspect of the present invention, an alkene containing from 2 to about 35 carbon atoms is contacted with a supported catalyst of the present invention in the presence of H2 and CO and under conditions effective to convert the alkene to the desired product. The hydroformylation reaction may be carried out in the<br>
gas phase or in the liquid phase using conditions well<br><br>
known to those skilled in the art.	<br>

This example illustrates a procedure for the preparation of a supported catalyst prepared in accordance with the method of the present invention described above.<br>
Four grams of the support material was suspended in 30 mL of methanol and stirred for 15 minutes after which time a solution of 200 micromoles of the heteropoly acid in 25 mL of methanol was added over a short time. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 minutes. A solution of 200 micromoles of the metal complex catalyst in 10 mL of methanol was then added slowly under vigorous stirring. After the addition was completed, stirring at room temperature was continued for about eight to about twelve hours after which time the suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube and the solid separated by centrifugation. After decantation of the supernatant liquid, the solid was washed several times with methanol until no color was observed in the wash liquid. The residue was dried under vacuum and stored in a screw capped vial until use.<br><br>

To this mixture was slowly added 1 mL of methanol containing 20 micromoles of the metal complex catalyst and the suspension stirred at room temperature for several hours in air and the stirring stopped. After the catalyst had settled, the liquid was withdrawn with a syringe and a 15 mL portion of methanol was added to the reactor. The mixture was stirred again for about 30-45 minutes, and the liquid again withdrawn. This washing procedure was repeated at least three times or until no color was observed in the wash liquid. After this, the air in the reactor was replaced with hydrogen, a solution of the reaction substrate was introduced into the reactor and the reaction initiated.<br><br>

To this mixture was slowly added 1 mL of methanol containing 2 0 micromoles of the metal complex catalyst and the suspension stirred for several hours at room temperature and the stirring stopped. After the catalyst had settled, the liquid was withdrawn with a syringe and a 15 mL portion of methanol was added to the reactor. The mixture was stirred again for about 30 to 45 minutes, and the liquid again withdrawn. This washing procedure was repeated at least three times or until no color was observed in the wash liquid. After this, the inert gas in the reactor was replaced with hydrogen, a solution of the reaction substrate was introduced into the reactor and the hydrogenation initiated.<br><br>

present invention.	<br><br>
To a suspension of 1 gram of Norit carbon in 10 mL of methanol was added a solution of 200 micromoles of the heteropoly acid in 25 mL of methanol at a rate of 1 mL/min. After this addition was complete, a solution of 400 micromoles of a base such as NaOH in 15 mL of methanol was added at the same rate and the resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature for an additional 12 hours. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant decanted. The modified support was washed with 20 mL portions of methanol until all of the soluble material had been removed. The solid was then dried under vacuum and stored in a glass vial until use. To a 180 mg portion of the modified support suspended in 3 mL of methyl acetate was added, with stirring, a solution of 25 micromoles of Pd{R, R-BINAP) Cl2 in 3 mL of methylene chloride. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 12 hours, washed five times with 5 mL portions of methyl acetate and then used for an appropriate reaction. The supported catalyst can also be dried and stored for future use.<br><br>

EXAMPLE V<br>
This example describes the general procedure used for the hydrogenation of the various substrates over the catalysts prepared as described in the previous examples.<br>
To a 25 mL reaction flask was added an amount of catalyst prepared by one of the procedures described in Examples I-III and containing 2 0 micromoles of the active metal complex. A solution of 0.82 millimoles of the reaction substrate in 10 mL of solvent was then added and the flask was evacuated and filled with hydrogen three times. The temperature and pressure in this reactor were set to the appropriate values and the reactor was stirred at such a rate as to avoid mass transfer control of the reaction to initiate the reaction. The amount of hydrogen taken up was measured by a computerized system for introducing into the reactor pulses containing known quantities of hydrogen. These pulses were introduced into the reactor at such a rate as to maintain essentially a constant pressure of hydrogen in the reactor system with the time of each pulse also recorded by the computer. After hydrogen absorption ceased the catalyst was separated from the reaction solution and the product was analyzed by gas chromatography or HPLC using an appropriate column.<br>

EXAMPLE XVII<br>
The example illustrates the preparation of a titanium alkoxide modified silica and its use as a support for Rh (P (C6H5) 3) 3C1/PTA.<br>
To a flask containing 100 mL of dry toluene<br>
was added 30 g of ICN60 silica which had been<br>
previously dried by heating at 90°C for one hour under<br>
a vacuum of 18 mm Hg immediately before use. To this<br>
suspension was added in one portion a solution of 7.65,<br>
g of titanium isopropoxide in 30 mL of dry toluene and<br>
the flask was purged with nitrogen. The temperature<br>
of the suspension was slowly raised to 95°-100°C and<br>
kept, with stirring, at that temperature overnight.<br>
After cooling, the solid was washed three times with <br>
100 mL portions of dry toluene and two times with <br>
freshly distilled methanol.	<br>
To this solid was added 50 mL of dry<br>
methanol and a solution of 12.9 g of phosphotungstic acid in methanol. The suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature under dry nitrogen and the solid separated and washed five times with 100 mL portions of methanol. The solid was dried at 60° for one hour.<br>
To 40Omg of this modified support in 10 mL of acetone was added a solution of 20 micromoles of Rh(P(C6H5) 3) 3C1 in 2 mL of acetone after purging the flask with nitrogen. The resulting slurry was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 hours and the liquid extracted from the reactor. The solid was washed with 10 mL portions of acetone until there was<br><br>
-44-<br>
no color in the wash liquid. The catalyst was dried under vacuum at room temperature for two hours and then used for the hydrogenation of 1 hexene using the procedure described in Example V. After each use the colorless liquid was removed from the reactor and fresh solvent and reactant were added for an additional hydrogenation. This catalyst was re-used eight times with no loss of activity nor any loss of the metal complex.<br><br>
-45-<br>
EXAMPLE XVIII<br>
This example illustrates the use of this technique for the supporting of a non-precious metal complex. The support used is a titanium alkoxide modified silica.<br>
One gram of the titanium alkoxide modified silica support with the attached PTA as described in Example XVII and 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were placed in a flask. After purging the flask with nitrogen, 65.4 mg of NiCl2VTPP)2 dissolved int 1 mL of THF was added and the resulting slurry was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours (TPP=triphenylphosphine) The liquid was extracted and the solid washed 5 times with 20 mL portions of dry THF. The catalyst was <br><br>
dried under vacuum at room temperature for two hours and used immediately.<br>
To 500 mg of this catalyst was added 6 mL of THF and 1.62 mL of a cold solution containing 2.9 mmole of phenyl lithium. The mixture was cooled to 0°C under stirring and 0.42 mL of B(OCH3)3 (3.62 mmol) was slowly added followed by 0.167 ml (1.44 mmole) of allyl methyl carbonate and the temperature was allowed to rise to ambient. The mixture was then heated, with stirring, at 60°C for 12 hours. The liquid was separated from the solid catalyst and poured into a mixture of 20 mL of pentane and 20 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. After vigorous shaking the organic layer was separated and filtered through a Celite pad. After drying and evaporation of the organic phase, gas chromatographic analysis of the<br><br>
-46-<br>
residue using an HP-1 column showed that 3-phenyl propene-1 was formed in a yield identical to that obtained using the soluble nickel catalyst.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
