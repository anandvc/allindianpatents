SYSTEM FOR SUPPRESSING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM<br>
CONTROLLED ATMOSPHERE ENVIRONMENTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system for suppressing carbon<br>
dioxide from controlled atmosphere environments.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in storage<br>
rooms for preserving fruit with a low CO2 and oxygen content is performed<br>
in various manners, including the following:<br>
-	introduction in the storage rooms of chemical substances, such as<br>
calcium hydrate, capable of reacting with CO2 to obtain solid<br>
compounds;<br>
-	use of machines which draw the CO2-rich air in order to bring it<br>
into contact with particular chemical substances, such as aqueous<br>
solutions of potassium hydrate or of particular amines, which react<br>
with the CO2 that is present in the air, the purified air being then<br>
returned to the storage room;<br>
-	introduction of nitrogen in the storage room, consequently reducing<br>
the CO2 that is present by air exchange;<br>
-	use of activated-carbon absorbers, modified so as to have an<br>
injection of nitrogen in the filters, which allows to reduce the<br>
amount of oxygen-rich air which normal activated-carbon absorbers<br>
introduce in the storage rooms after each step for regenerating the<br>
filters with external air.<br>
The first two methods require very intensive work, considerable<br>
workforce and entail considerable costs for the disposal of the spent<br>
chemical substances.<br>
The third method entails very high operating costs, due to the cost of<br>
supplying nitrogen, while the fourth method is by far the most valid but<br>
requires the availability of additional devices for generating and storing the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
2<br>
nitrogen and accordingly requires heavy plant investments and operating<br>
costs.<br>
In order to try to solve the drawbacks noted above, systems have been<br>
proposed which have one or more activated-carbon filters and one or more<br>
filters for absorbing oxygen using molecular or chemical type sieves, which<br>
are designed to absorb either the oxygen from the air before it is introduced<br>
in the storage room or the oxygen that is present in the activated-carbon<br>
filters before the passage of the air to be filtered. These systems, moreover,<br>
are disclosed in Italian patent no. 1,297,501 by Villa Ivano and Mercadini<br>
Massimo.<br>
However, presently the need is particularly felt to preserve food,<br>
particularly fruit, in environments which have an extremely low oxygen<br>
content but also a low CO2 content.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a system for<br>
suppressing carbon dioxide from controlled atmosphere environments,<br>
particularly from storage rooms for preserving food products such as fruit,<br>
which is capable of eliminating or in any case reducing drastically the<br>
drawbacks noted in the systems currently in use.<br>
This aim and this and other objects, which will become better<br>
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a system for suppressing carbon<br>
dioxide from controlled atmosphere environments, comprising at least one<br>
activated-carbon filter, which is connected to an intake duct and a discharge<br>
duct, adapted to introduce and extract air into and from a storage room, at<br>
least one blower being provided along said discharge duct, said blower<br>
having, upstream or downstream of said at least one activated-carbon filter,<br>
in succession, a discharge duct which Can be controlled by a check valve,<br>
and a first valve, characterized in that said blower is associated with a<br>
reversal valve, which is adapted to; switch the flow during the regeneration<br>
step so as to perform the regeneration of said at least one activated-carbon<br>
 <br>

filter in countercurrent.<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
In the examples of embodiments that follow, individual<br>
characteristics, given in relation to specific examples, may actually be<br>
interchanged with other different characteristics that exist in other examples<br>
of embodiments.<br>
Moreover, it is noted that anything found to be already known during<br>
the patenting process is understood not to be claimed and to be the subject<br>
of a disclaimer.<br>
Initially with reference to the diagram of Figure 1, the reference<br>
numeral 1 generally designates a system according to the invention, which<br>
has at least one controlled-atmosphere storage room C, typically a fruit<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
4<br>
preservation room, an intake duct 2 and a discharge duct 3 for the air to be<br>
introduced into, and removed from, the storage room C.<br>
The system 1 has at least one activated-carbon filter B, which is<br>
connected to the storage room C by means of the intake duct 2 and the<br>
discharge duct 3.<br>
In particular, the activated-carbon filter B is capable of trapping the<br>
CO2 contained in the fluid medium which flows through it and is connected<br>
in parallel to the intake duct 2 and to the discharge duct 3.<br>
A first valve 4 is provided on the discharge duct 3 and a blower 5 is<br>
arranged downstream of said first valve; a first discharge duct 6 is<br>
connected between the first valve 4 and the blower 5 and is controlled by a<br>
first valve 7.<br>
The activated-carbon filter B is connected to a second discharge duct<br>
8, which is controlled by a first valve 9, while a second valve 10 is provided<br>
along the intake duct 2.<br>
According to the present invention, the blower 5 is associated with a<br>
reversal valve 11, which is adapted to exchange the stream during the<br>
regeneration step, so as to regenerate the activated-carbon filter B in<br>
countercurrent.<br>
Advantageously, the blower 5 is functionally connected to an inverter<br>
12, which is associated with a control device (not shown in the figures) and<br>
is adapted to increase the speed of the blower 5 (and therefore the flow-rate<br>
of the fluid medium through the discharge duct 3) during the step for<br>
regeneration of the activated-carbon filter B.<br>
The valves 4, 7, 9 and 10 must be gas-tight, and despite being shown<br>
as single valves can of course be grouped in a three-way arrangement<br>
Therefore, the system 1 described above has a single activated-carbon<br>
filter B with discontinuous purification and operates according to four steps.<br>
During the first step, or CO2 absorption step, the valves 4 and 10 are<br>
open and the reversal valve 11 is in the normal position. The blower 5 draws<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
5<br>
air from the storage room C, sends it to the activated-carbon filter B and<br>
returns purified air to the storage room c. Typically, the duration of this first<br>
step is approximately 5-10 minutes. If an inverter 12 is used, during this<br>
step a reduced speed of the blower 5 is used at the beginning of the step,<br>
increasing it a few seconds before said step ends.<br>
In the second step, or exchange step, the valves 7 and 10 are open and<br>
the reversal valve 11 is still in the normal position; the blower 5 draws<br>
external air and sends it to the activated-carbon filter B; said air, depleted of<br>
its oxygen, is introduced in the storage room C. The duration of this second<br>
step is on the order of 10-20 seconds.<br>
The third step, or regeneration step, is performed with the valves 7<br>
and 9 open and with the reversal valve 11 in the switching position. The<br>
blower 5 draws external air from the valve 9, conveys it through the<br>
activated-carbon filter B, and returns it outside. The duration of this step is<br>
similar to the duration of the first step if the inverter 12 is present.<br>
Otherwise, i.e., if the speed of the blower 5 is constant, it is convenient to<br>
provide a duration which is slightly longer by approximately 10-20%.<br>
In the fourth step, or decompensation step, the valves 4 and 9 are<br>
open and the reversal valve 11 is in the normal position. The blower 5 draws<br>
air from the storage room C by means of the valve 4 and sends it to the<br>
activated-carbon filter B, and the air that passes through the activated-<br>
carbon filter B is then expelled externally. The duration of this step is<br>
approximately 10-20 seconds, depending on the flow-rate of the blower 5.<br>
The cycle then resumes from the first step.<br>
The diagrams shown in Figures 2 to 5 illustrate a system 1 with a dual<br>
activated-carbon filter (A and B), which is therefore capable of performing<br>
continuous purification of the air before it is introduced in the storage room<br>
C.<br>
The components are substantially the same ones shown in Figure 1,<br>
but they are duplicated; the reference letter A designates the components<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
6<br>
related to the activated-carbon filter A and the letter B designates those<br>
related to the other activated-carbon filter B.<br>
In this case also, the blower 5 is associated with a reversal valve 11,<br>
which is adapted to switch the flow during the regeneration step, so as to<br>
regenerate the activated-carbon filters A and B in countercurrent.<br>
Advantageously, the blower 5 is connected functionally to an inverter<br>
12, which is associated with a control device (not shown in the figures) and<br>
is adapted to increase the speed of the blower 5 (and therefore the flow-rate<br>
of the fluid medium through the discharge duct 3) during the step for<br>
regeneration of the activated-carbon filters A and B.<br>
An additional fan 6b is also provided.<br>
The system operates completely automatically and the steps are<br>
controlled by a PLC device.<br>
The operating cycle is performed in six steps, during which the fans 5<br>
and 6b run constantly.<br>
The first step (shown schematically in Figure 2) provides absorption<br>
by the activated-carbon filter A and regeneration of the activated-carbon<br>
carbon filter B. The valves 4a, 4d, 9a and 9b are open and the reversal valve<br>
11 is in the normal position. The additional fan 6b draws air from the<br>
storage room C and sends it to the first activated-carbon filter A, and at the<br>
same time returns purified air into the storage room C. The blower 5,<br>
optionally driven by the inverter 12 at a high frequency (for example 62 Hz,<br>
a flow-rate which is approximately 20% higher than a normal frequency of<br>
50 Hz) draws air from the outside and conveys it through the second<br>
activated-carbon filter B for a period ranging from 5 to 10 minutes.<br>
In the second step, or pre-switching step, the condition of the valves<br>
remains unchanged, while the inverter brings the frequency of the speed<br>
variator to the normal speed (50 Hz) for approximately 8-10 seconds.<br>
In the third step, or first switching step (shown in Figure 3), the<br>
valves 4b, 4c, 9a and 9b are open and the reversal valve 11 is in the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
7<br>
switching position. The additional fan 6b draws air from the storage room C<br>
and sends it to the second activated-carbon filter B, and the air contained in<br>
said second activated-carbon filter B is expelled outside. The blower 5<br>
draws air from the outside and sends it to the first activated-carbon filter A.<br>
The oxygen-poor air contained in the first activated-carbon filter A is<br>
returned to the storage room C. The duration of this step can range from 10<br>
to 20 seconds depending on the flow-rate of the additional fan 6b and of the<br>
blower 5.<br>
The fourth step (shown schematically in Figure 4) provides<br>
absorption by the activated-carbon filter B and regeneration of the<br>
activated-carbon filter A. The valves 4c, 4b, 10a and 10b are open and the<br>
reversal valve 11 is in the normal position. The additional fan 6b draws air<br>
from the storage room C and conveys it toward the second activated-carbon<br>
filter B, and at the same time returns purified air into the storage room C.<br>
The blower 5, optionally controlled by the inverter 12 at a high frequency<br>
(for example 62 Hz, a flow-rate which is approximately 20% higher than a<br>
normal frequency of 50 Hz) draws air, conveying it toward the first<br>
activated-carbon filter A for a period ranging 5 from to 10 minutes.<br>
In the fifth step, or pre-switching step, the condition of the valves<br>
remains unchanged, while the inverter brings the frequency of the speed<br>
variator to the normal value (50 Hz) for approximately 8-10 seconds.<br>
In the sixth step, or second switching step (shown in Figure 5), the<br>
valves 4a, 4d, 10a and 10b are open and the reversal valve 11 is in the<br>
switching position. The additional fan 6b draws air from the storage room C<br>
and sends it to the second activated-carbon filter B, and the air contained in<br>
said second activated-carbon filter B is expelled externally. The blower 5<br>
draws air from the outside and sends it to the first activated-carbon filter A.<br>
The oxygen-poor air contained in the first activated-carbon filter A is<br>
returned to the storage room C. This step can last from 10 to 20 seconds,<br>
depending on the flow-rate of the additional fan 6b and of the blower 5.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/097217	PCT/EP2006/002034<br>
8<br>
The cycle then resumes from the first step.<br>
The second and fifth steps are not indispensable for the operation of<br>
the system 1.<br>
The valves 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d and 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d can be grouped into<br>
four three-way valves or into two four-way valves.<br>
It has been found that a system according to the invention allows to<br>
improve the efficiency of activated-carbon filters without the aid of<br>
expensive injections of nitrogen or of oxygen absorbers. By improving<br>
efficiency while keeping the other conditions equal, the introduced oxygen<br>
is reduced..<br>
All the characteristics of the invention indicated above as<br>
advantageous, convenient or the like, might also be omitted or be replaced<br>
with equivalents.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous<br>
modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
Thus, for example, all the valves that are used can be of the electrical<br>
and/or pneumatic type and can be controlled by a control unit according to<br>
preset programs.<br>
Moreover, with reference to the embodiment with two activated-<br>
carbon filters, nothing prevents reversing, in the system, the positions of the<br>
blower 5 and of the additional fan 6b.<br>
Moreover, the system might be provided with an oxygen absorption<br>
filter which is designed to absorb either the oxygen of the air before it is<br>
introduced in the controlled atmosphere environment/environments or the<br>
oxygen that is present in the, or each, activated-carbon filter before the<br>
passage of the air to be filtered.<br>
In practice, the materials used, as well as the dimensions, may be any<br>
according to requirements.<br>
