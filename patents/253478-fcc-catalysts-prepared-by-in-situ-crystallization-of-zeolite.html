				<td>FCC CATALYSTS PREPARED BY IN-SITU CRYSTALLIZATION OF ZEOLITE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel fluid<br>
catalytic cracking catalysts comprising microspheres<br>
containing Y-faujasite zeolite and having exceptionally<br>
high activity and other desirable characteristics, methods<br>
for making such catalysts and the use of such catalysts<br>
for cracking petroleum feedstocks, particularly under<br>
short residence time processes.<br>
Since the 1960's, most commercial fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalysts have contained zeolites as an active<br>
component. Such catalysts have taken the form of small<br>
particles, called microspheres, containing both an active<br>
zeolite component and a non-zeolite component.<br>
Frequently, the non-zeolitic component is referred to as<br>
the matrix for the zeolitic component of the catalyst.<br>
The non-zeolitic component is known to perform a number of<br>
important functions, relating to both the catalytic and<br>
physical properties of the catalyst. Oblad described<br>
those functions as follows:<br>
"The matrix is said to act as a sink for sodium in<br>
the sieve thus adding stability to the zeolite<br>
particles in the matrix catalyst. The matrix serves<br><br>
the additional function of: diluting the zeolite;<br>
stabilizing it towards heat and steam and mechanical<br>
attrition; providing high porosity so that the<br>
zeolite can be used to its maximum capacity and<br>
regeneration can be made easy; and finally it<br>
provides the bulk properties that are important for<br>
heat transfer during regeneration and cracking and<br>
heat storage in large-scale catalytic cracking."<br>
A.G. Oblad Molecular Sieve Cracking Catalysts, The<br>
Oil And Gas Journal, 70, 84 (March 27, 1972).<br>
In prior art fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, the<br>
active zeolitic component is incorporated into the<br>
microspheres of the catalyst by one of two general<br>
techniques. In one technique, the zeolitic component is<br>
crystallized and then incorporated into microspheres in a<br>
separate step. In the second technique, the in-situ<br>
technique, microspheres are first formed and the zeolitic<br>
component is then crystallized in the microspheres<br>
themselves to provide microspheres containing both<br>
zeolitic and non-zeolitic components.<br>
It has long been recognized that for a fluid<br>
catalytic cracking catalyst to be commercially successful,<br>
it must have commercially acceptable activity,<br>
selectivity, and stability characteristics. It must be<br>
sufficiently active to give economically attractive<br><br>
yields, it must have good selectivity towards producing<br>
products that are desired and not producing products that<br>
are not desired, and it must be sufficiently<br>
hydrothermally stable and attrition resistant to have a<br>
commercially useful life.<br>
Two products that are particularly undesirable in<br>
commercial catalytic cracking processes are coke and<br>
hydrogen. Even small increases in the yields of these<br>
products relative to the yield of gasoline can cause<br>
significant practical problems. For example, increases in<br>
the amount of coke produced can cause undesirable<br>
increases in the heat that is generated by burning off the<br>
coke during the highly exothermic regeneration of the<br>
catalyst. Conversely, insufficient coke production can<br>
also distort the heat balance of the cracking process. In<br>
addition, in commercial refineries, expensive compressors<br>
are used to handle high volume gases, such as hydrogen.<br>
Increases in the volume of hydrogen produced, therefore,<br>
can add substantially to the capital expense of the<br>
refinery.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by cross-reference, discloses novel<br>
fluid cracking catalysts comprising attrition-resistant,<br>
high zeolitic content, catalytically active microspheres<br>
containing more than about 40%, preferably 50-70% by<br><br>
weight Y faujasite and methods for making such catalysts<br>
by crystallizing more than about 40% sodium Y zeolite in<br>
porous microspheres composed of a mixture of two different<br>
forms of chemically reactive calcined kaolin, namely,<br>
metakaolin (kaolin calcined to undergo a strong<br>
endothermic reaction associated with dehydroxylation) and<br>
kaolin calcined under conditions more severe than those<br>
used to convert kaolin to metakaolin, i.e., kaolin<br>
calcined to undergo the characteristic kaolin exothermic<br>
reaction, sometimes referred to as the spinel form of<br>
calcined kaolin. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
microspheres containing the two forms of calcined kaolin<br>
are immersed in an alkaline sodium silicate solution,<br>
which is heated, preferably until the maximum obtainable<br>
amount of Y faujasite is crystallized in the microspheres.<br>
In practice of the '902 technology, the porous<br>
microspheres in which the zeolite is crystallized are<br>
preferably prepared by forming an aqueous slurry of<br>
powdered raw (hydrated) kaolin (Al2O3:2SiO2:2H2O) and<br>
powdered calcined kaolin that has undergone the exotherm<br>
together with a minor amount of sodium silicate which acts<br>
as fluidizing agent for the slurry that is charged to a<br>
spray dryer to form microspheres and then functions to<br>
provide physical integrity to the components of the spray<br>
dried microspheres. The spray dried microspheres'<br><br>
containing a mixture of hydrated kaolin and kaolin<br>
calcined to undergo the exotherm are then calcined under<br>
controlled conditions, less severe than those required to<br>
cause kaolin to undergo the exotherm, in order to<br>
dehydrate the hydrated kaolin portion of the microspheres<br>
and to effect its conversion into metakaolin, this<br>
resulting in microspheres containing the desired mixture<br>
of metakaolin, kaolin calcined to undergo the exotherm and<br>
sodium silicate binder. In illustrative examples of the<br>
'902 patent, about equal weights of hydrated kaolin and<br>
spinel are present in the spray dryer feed and the<br>
resulting calcined microspheres contain somewhat more<br>
kaolin that has undergone the exotherm than metakaolin.<br>
The '902 patent teaches that the calcined microspheres<br>
comprise about 30-60% by weight metakaolin and about 40-<br>
70% by weight kaolin characterized through its<br>
characteristic exotherm. A less preferred method<br>
described in the patent, involves spray drying a slurry<br>
containing a mixture of kaolin previously calcined to<br>
metakaolin condition and kaolin calcined to undergo the<br>
exotherm but without including any hydrated kaolin in the<br>
slurry, thus providing microspheres containing both<br>
metakaolin and kaolin calcined to undergo the exotherm<br>
directly, without calcining to convert hydrated kaolin to<br>
metakaolin.<br><br>
In carrying out the invention described in the '902<br>
patent, the microspheres composed of kaolin calcined to<br>
undergo the exotherm and metakaolin are reacted with a<br>
caustic enriched sodium silicate solution in the presence<br>
of a crystallization initiator (seeds) to convert silica<br>
and alumina in the microspheres into synthetic sodium<br>
faujasite (zeolite Y). The microspheres are separated<br>
from the sodium silicate mother liquor, ion-exchanged with<br>
rare earth, ammonium ions or both to form rare earth or<br>
various known stabilized forms of catalysts. The<br>
technology of the '902 patent provides means for achieving<br>
a desirable and unique combination of high zeolite content<br>
associated with high activity, good selectivity and<br>
thermal stability, as well as attrition-resistance.<br>
The aforementioned technology has met widespread<br>
commercial success. Because of the availability of high<br>
zeolite content microspheres which are also attrition-<br>
resistant, custom designed catalysts are now available to<br>
oil refineries with specific performance goals, such as<br>
improved activity and/or selectivity without incurring<br>
costly mechanical redesigns. A significant portion of the<br>
FCC catalysts presently supplied to domestic and foreign<br>
oil refiners is based on this technology. Refineries<br>
whose FCC units are limited by the maximum tolerable<br>
regenerator temperature or by air blower capacity seek<br><br>
selectivity improvements resulting in reductions in coke<br>
make while the gas compressor limitations make catalysts<br>
that reduce gas make highly desirable. Seemingly a small<br>
reduction in coke can represent a significant economic<br>
benefit to the operation of an FCC unit with air blower or<br>
regenerator temperature limitations.<br>
Improvements in cracking activity and gasoline<br>
selectivity of cracking catalysts do not necessarily go<br>
hand in hand. Thus, a cracking catalyst can have<br>
outstandingly high cracking activity, but if the activity<br>
results in a high level of conversion to coke and/or gas<br>
at the expense of gasoline the catalyst will have limited<br>
utility. Catalytic cracking activity in present day FCC<br>
catalysts is attributable to both the zeolite and non-<br>
zeolite (e.g., matrix) components. Zeolite cracking tends<br>
to be gasoline selective. Matrix cracking tends to be<br>
less gasoline selective. After appropriate ion-exchange<br>
treatments with rare earth cations, high zeolite content<br>
microspheres produced by the in situ procedure described<br>
in the '902 patent are both highly active and highly<br>
gasoline selective. As zeolite content of these unblended<br>
microspheres is increased, both activity and selectivity<br>
tend to increase. This may be explained by the decrease<br>
in matrix content with increase in zeolite content and the<br>
decreasingly prominent role of nonselective matrix<br><br>
cracking. Thus, increases in the zeolite content of the<br>
high zeolite content microspheres have been reported to be<br>
highly desirable.<br>
The activity and selectivity characteristics of the<br>
catalysts formed by the process of the '902 patent are<br>
achieved even though, in general, the catalysts have<br>
relatively low total porosity as compared to fluid<br>
catalytic cracking catalysts prepared by incorporating the<br>
zeolite content into a separate matrix. In particular,<br>
the microspheres of such catalysts, in some cases, have a<br>
total porosity of less than about 0.15 cc/g. or even less<br>
than about 0.10 cc/g. In general, the microspheres of the<br>
'902 patent have a total porosity of less than 0.30 cc/g.<br>
As used herein, "total porosity" means the volume of pores<br>
having diameters in the range of 35-20,000A , as<br>
determined by the mercury porosimetry technique. The '902<br>
patent noted that it was surprising that microspheres<br>
having a total porosity of less than about 0.15 cc/g.<br>
exhibit the activity and selectivity characteristics<br>
found. For example, such a result is contrary to the<br>
prior art disclosures that low pore volumes "can lead to<br>
selectivity losses due to diffusional restrictions."<br>
It is believed that the relatively low porosity of<br>
the catalyst microspheres formed as in the '902 patent<br>
does not adversely effect activity and selectivity<br><br>
characteristics, since the microspheres of the '902 patent<br>
are not diffusion limited relative to the typical FCC<br>
processing conditions which were used at the time of the<br>
patent. In particular, catalyst contact time with the<br>
feed to be cracked was typically 5 seconds or more. Thus,<br>
while typical FCC catalysts formed by mechanically<br>
incorporating the zeolite within a matrix may have been<br>
more porous, the reaction time in prior art FCC risers did<br>
not yield any advantage in activity or selectivity. This<br>
result inspired the conclusion that transport processes<br>
were not at all limiting in FCC catalysts, at least<br>
outside the zeolite structure. Assertions made to the<br>
contrary were inconsistent with the facts and easily<br>
dismissed as self-serving. Importantly, the attrition<br>
resistance of the microspheres prepared in accordance with<br>
the '902 patent was superior to the conventional FCC<br>
catalysts in which the crystallized zeolite catalytic<br>
component was physically incorporated into the non-<br>
zeolitic matrix.<br>
Recently, however, FCC apparatus have been developed<br>
which drastically reduce the contact time between the<br>
catalyst and the feed which is to be cracked.<br>
Conventionally, the reactor is a riser in which the<br>
catalyst and hydrocarbon feed enter at the bottom of the<br>
riser and are transported through the riser. The hot<br><br>
catalyst effects cracking of the hydrocarbon during the<br>
passage through the riser and upon discharge from the<br>
riser, the cracked products are separated from the<br>
catalyst. The catalyst is then delivered to a regenerator<br>
where the coke is removed, thereby cleaning the catalyst<br>
and at the same time providing the necessary heat for the<br>
catalyst in the riser reactor. The newer riser reactors<br>
operate at lower residence time and higher operating<br>
temperatures to minimize coke selectivity and delta coke.<br>
Several of the designs do not even employ a riser, further<br>
reducing contact time to below one second. Gasoline and<br>
dry gas selectivity can improve as a result of the<br>
hardware changes. These FCC unit modifications are<br>
marketed as valuable independent of the type of catalyst<br>
purchased, implying an absence of systematic problems in<br>
state of the art catalyst technology.<br>
The processing of increasingly heavier feeds in FCC<br>
type processes and the tendency of such feeds to elevate<br>
coke production and yield undesirable products have also<br>
led to new methods of contacting the feeds with catalyst.<br>
The methods of contacting FCC catalyst for very short<br>
contact periods have been of particular interest. Thus,<br>
short contact times of less than 3 seconds in the riser,<br>
and ultra short contact times of 1 second or less have<br><br>
shown improvements in selectivity to gasoline while<br>
decreasing coke and dry gas production.<br>
To compensate for the continuing decline in catalyst<br>
to oil contact time in FCC processing, the "equilibrium"<br>
catalysts in use have tended to become more active. Thus,<br>
increases in the total surface area of the catalyst need<br>
to be achieved and as well, the level of rare earth oxide<br>
promoters added to the catalysts are increasing.<br>
Moreover, cracking temperatures are rising to compensate<br>
for the reduction in conversion. Unfortunately, it has<br>
been found that the API gravity of the bottoms formed<br>
during short contact time (SCT) often increases after a<br>
unit revamp, leading some to suggest that the heaviest<br>
portion of the hydrocarbon feed takes longer to crack.<br>
Further, while a high total surface area of the catalyst<br>
is valued, the FCC process still values attrition<br>
resistance. Accordingly, while not obvious to those<br>
participating in the art, it has become increasingly<br>
likely that an optimization of FCC catalysts for the new<br>
short contact time and ultra short contact time processing<br>
which is presently being used is needed.<br>
It is now theorized that, under the short contact<br>
time processing of hydrocarbons, further improvements can<br>
be gained by eliminating diffusion limitations that may<br>
still exist in current catalysts. This is being concluded<br><br>
even as these materials excel at the application. It is<br>
theorized that improvements in these catalysts may be<br>
produced by optimization of catalyst porosity and the<br>
elimination of active site occlusion and diffusional<br>
restrictions of the binder phases present in catalysts<br>
prepared by the so-called incorporation method.<br>
While the present assignee has produced zeolite<br>
microspheres with increased zeolite content and increased<br>
activity by increasing the macroporosity of the spray<br>
dried microsphere zeolite precursors, the porosity of the<br>
formed zeolite microsphere catalysts has not before been<br>
considered a problem since there has been found no<br>
diffusion limitation under the previous FCC processing<br>
techniques. For example, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,965,233, to Speronello discloses increasing the<br>
zeolite content of an in-situ catalyst by forming highly<br>
porous precursor microspheres, which allow increased<br>
amounts of zeolite to grow within the porous matrix. The<br>
highly porous precursor microspheres are formed by spray<br>
drying a slurry of hydrous kaolin, which is characterized<br>
by the presence of a major amount of large (greater than 2<br>
microns) kaolin stacks along with spinel calcined kaolin.<br>
When spray dried, the coarse hydrous kaolin results in<br>
microspheres having a desired high content of macropores<br>
in which the zeolite Y can grow. Likewise, commonly<br><br>
assigned, U.S. Patent No. 5,023,220, to Dight, et. al.<br>
also increases the macroporosity of the precursor<br>
microspheres by spray drying a mixture of hydrous kaolin,<br>
metakaolin and spinel. These catalyst microspheres have a<br>
substantial level of zeolite and are very active and<br>
selective. Further, the high alumina, silica-alumina<br>
matrix portion of the catalysts is often totally<br>
surrounded by the zeolite formed in-situ such that the<br>
matrix is only now understood to provide a reduced level<br>
of bottoms cracking under the short contact time FCC<br>
conditions.<br>
In commonly assigned, copending application U.S.<br>
Serial No. 09/956,250, filed September 20, 2001, novel<br>
zeolite microspheres are disclosed. These zeolite<br>
microspheres are macroporous, have sufficient levels of<br>
zeolite to be very active and are of a unique morphology<br>
to achieve effective conversion of hydrocarbons to cracked<br>
gasoline products with improved bottoms cracking under SCT<br>
FCC processing. The novel zeolite microspheres are<br>
produced by novel processing, which is a modification of<br>
technology described in U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902. It has<br>
been found that if the non-zeolite, alumina-rich matrix of<br>
the catalyst is derived from an ultrafine hydrous kaolin<br>
source having a particulate size such that 90 wt. % of the<br>
hydrous kaolin particles are less than 2 microns, and<br><br>
which is pulverized and calcined through the exotherm, a<br>
macro-porous zeolite microsphere can be produced. More<br>
generally, the FCC catalyst matrix useful to achieve FCC<br>
catalyst macroporosity is derived from alumina sources,<br>
such as kaolin calcined through the exotherm, that have a<br>
specified water pore volume, which distinguishes over<br>
prior art calcined kaolin used to form the catalyst<br>
matrix. The water pore volume is derived from an<br>
Incipient Slurry Point (ISP) test, which is described in<br>
the application.<br>
The morphology of the microsphere catalysts which are<br>
formed is unique relative to the in-situ microsphere<br>
catalysts formed previously. Use of a pulverized,<br>
ultrafine hydrous kaolin calcined through the exotherm<br>
yields in-situ zeolite microspheres having a macroporous<br>
structure in which the macropores of the structure are<br>
essentially coated or lined with zeolite subsequent to<br>
crystallization. Macroporosity as defined herein means<br>
the catalyst has a macropore volume in the pore range of<br>
600 - 20,000 A of at least 0.07 cc/gm mercury intrusion.<br>
The novel catalyst is optimal for FCC processing,<br>
including the short contact time processing in which the<br>
hydrocarbon feed is contacted with a catalyst for times of<br>
about 3 seconds or less.<br><br>
In the broadest sense, the invention as disclosed in<br>
U.S. Serial No. 09/956,250 is not restricted to<br>
macroporous catalysts having a non-zeolite matrix derived<br>
solely from kaolin. Thus, any alumina source which has<br>
the proper combinations of porosity and reactivity during<br>
zeolite synthesis and can generate the desired catalyst<br>
macroporosity and morphology can be used. The desired<br>
morphology comprises a matrix which is well dispersed<br>
throughout the catalyst, and the macropore walls of matrix<br>
are lined with zeolite and are substantially free of<br>
binder coatings. Accordingly, not only is the large pore<br>
surface area of the catalyst vastly improved over previous<br>
catalysts, and the active matrix dispersed throughout the<br>
microsphere, the zeolite crystals are readily accessible<br>
to the hydrocarbon feed. While not wishing to be bound by<br>
any theory of operation, it appears that previous<br>
catalysts in which the zeolite is incorporated into a<br>
matrix by physical mixing and glued with binder have<br>
sufficient macroporosity, however the binder coats the<br>
active zeolite catalyst thereby blocking accessibility<br>
thereto. The novel microsphere catalysts have a<br>
morphology which allows fast diffusion into the catalyst<br>
due to the macroporosity and enhanced dispersion of the<br>
matrix, and further provides the highest accessibility to<br>
the zeolite inasmuch as the zeolite is freely coated onto<br><br>
the walls of the pores. The term "freely" means that the<br>
zeolite phase is present on the surface of the matrix and<br>
is unobstructed by any binder phases. Merely having<br>
macroporosity does not provide the results that have been<br>
obtained, since conventional incorporated catalysts have<br>
similar macroporosity. It is therefore the combination of<br>
porosity and zeolite-coated macropore walls that give the<br>
surprising selectivity results.<br>
One would not have anticipated that contacting a<br>
heavy hydrocarbon feed, whose molecules are frequently if<br>
not generally too large to enter zeolite pores, with<br>
zeolite prior to feed contact with the matrix would be<br>
optimal, as has been found. Indeed, the prevailing<br>
"staged cracking" theory suggests the opposite, that the<br>
larger hydrocarbon molecules are first cracked on the<br>
active matrix and the formed smaller molecules<br>
subsequently cracked within the zeolite. Much research<br>
and promotional activity has been done in pursuit or<br>
support of this perceived ideal.<br>
In view of the success of the macroporous in-situ-<br>
formed zeolite microsphere as disclosed above, there is a<br>
continuing need to find novel macroporous zeolite<br>
catalysts in which the matrix is dispersed throughout the<br>
catalyst and the zeolite crystals are free of binder<br>
coatings and readily accessible to the hydrocarbon feed.<br><br>
There is a need as well to find other methods of forming<br>
such catalysts. Therefore, it is an object of the<br>
invention to provide a novel method for reproducibly<br>
preparing a catalyst that is an attrition resistant,<br>
highly porous catalyst with a zeolite-coated matrix<br>
morphology and provide novel catalysts having such<br>
properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a novel<br>
macroporous in-situ-formed zeolite catalyst is provided by<br>
forming a precursor reactive microsphere which contains<br>
reactive metakaolin and inert hydrous kaolin. The<br>
microsphere is reacted with an alkaline silicate solution<br>
to form the zeolite crystals. The presence of the hydrous<br>
kaolin as a matrix precursor has been found to yield a<br>
macroporous structure on the order of that disclosed in<br>
the aforementioned copending application, U.S. Serial No.<br>
09/956,250. In the copending application the macroporous<br>
structure is achieved using a calcined, ultra-fine hydrous<br>
kaolin as the matrix precursor. The catalyst of this<br>
invention can also include a matrix derived in part from<br>
kaolin calcined through the characteristic exotherm, as<br><br>
well as a calcined boehmite alumina which has been found<br>
useful for metal passivation.<br>
In the process of forming the novel catalyst of the<br>
present invention, metakaolin, hydrous kaolin, and a<br>
silicate binder are spray dried to form a precursor<br>
reactive microsphere. The hydrous kaolin is maintained as<br>
an inert component even if the as-spray dried microsphere<br>
is calcined by calcining at a lower temperature and<br>
avoiding the endothermic transformation of hydrous kaolin<br>
to metakaolin. The inert hydrous kaolin is not consumed<br>
under the caustic crystallization conditions. The<br>
metakaolin provides the reactive silica and alumina for<br>
crystallization and also enables the presence of high pore<br>
volume in the spray dried microsphere. The amount of<br>
metakaolin, or more generally, the amount of soluble<br>
alumina available to crystallize zeolite, is limited so<br>
that yield of zeolite is limited during the<br>
crystallization resulting in a sufficient macroporosity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catalysts of the invention are made by spray drying a<br>
feed mixture of hydrated kaolin, metakaolin, and a binder<br>
such as silica sol or sodium silicate. The spray dried<br>
microspheres are optionally acid-neutralized and washed to<br>
reduce sodium content. The spray dried microsphere are<br><br>
preferably subsequently calcined to form precursor porous<br>
microspheres. Importantly in this invention, the hydrous<br>
kaolin is maintained as an inert component by calcining at<br>
lower temperatures so as to avoid the endothermic<br>
transformation of the hydrous kaolin component to<br>
metakaolin. Calcination temperatures of less than 1000°F,<br>
preferably less than 800°F, can be used to calcine the<br>
spray dried microspheres.<br>
The amount of metakaolin in the spray dried and<br>
optionally calcined microspheres provides the soluble<br>
alumina available to grow zeolite. The amount of<br>
metakaolin present in the spray dried microspheres is<br>
limited with respect to the inerts such as hydrous kaolin<br>
so that the yield of zeolite is limited during<br>
crystallization. An excessive level of metakaolin in the<br>
reactive microsphere would yield a high level of zeolite<br>
that would reduce the porosity of the microsphere to an<br>
undesired low level. Accordingly, the spray dried<br>
microspheres after optional calcination will contain a<br>
metakaolin content of up to 50 wt.%, preferably up to 45<br>
wt%, and more preferably will be present in amounts of 30-<br>
40 wt%.<br>
Any binder used should contain only sodium, expressed<br>
as Na2O, which is easily removed. Although the silica or<br>
silicate binders traditionally used do bring these<br><br>
nutrients into the zeolite crystallization process, their<br>
main purpose is to provide mechanical strength to the<br>
green microspheres sufficient to withstand processing up<br>
until crystallization. Therefore, any binder capable of<br>
fulfilling this role while not interfering with the other<br>
constraints laid out herein would be adequate. Aluminum<br>
chlorohydrol for example might be useful.<br>
The precursor microspheres are reacted with zeolite<br>
seeds and an alkaline sodium silicate solution,<br>
substantially as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,395,809,<br>
the teachings of which are incorporated herein by cross-<br>
reference. The microspheres are crystallized to a desired<br>
zeolite content (typically ca. 40-75%), filtered, washed,<br>
ammonium exchanged, exchanged with rare-earth cations if<br>
required, calcined, exchanged a second time with ammonium<br>
ions, and calcined a second time if required.<br>
Especially preferred compositions of the solids in<br>
the slurries that are spray dried to form porous<br>
microspheres, and later optionally calcined at low<br>
temperature to prepare precursor reactive microspheres,<br>
are expressed hereinafter below in Table 1 as the weight<br>
percent of metakaolin and inerts including hydrated<br>
kaolin, calcined boehmite for metal passivation, and<br>
kaolin calcined through the exotherm (spinel or mullite)<br>
on a binder-free basis; weight % SiO2 binder is based on<br><br>
the grams of Si02 in the binder per gram of total weight<br>
of moisture-free spray dried microspheres and provided by<br>
sodium silicate. In general, the spray dried microspheres<br>
will have a size of from about 20 to 150 microns.<br>
Preferably, the size of the spray dried microspheres will<br>
range from about 50 to 100 microns and, more preferably,<br>
from about 69-90 microns.<br><br>
Hydrous kaolin is used as an inert in the slurry and<br>
acts as an alumina-containing matrix precursor of the<br>
catalyst. Thus, once crystallized, the zeolite catalyst<br>
will contain a silica-alumina matrix derived from the<br>
hydrous kaolin. The hydrous kaolin used as the alumina-<br>
containing matrix precursor of the catalytic microspheres<br>
is not singularly critical and can be obtained from a wide<br>
variety of commercial sources. The hydrous kaolin can<br>
suitably be either one or a mixture of ASP® 600 or ASP® 400<br><br>
kaolin, derived from coarse white kaolin crudes. Finer<br>
particle size hydrous kaolins can also be used, including<br>
those derived from gray clay deposits, such as LHT<br>
pigment. Purified water-processed kaolins from Middle<br>
Georgia have been used with success. The particle size of<br>
the hydrous kaolin is generally known to have an impact on<br>
microsphere porosity, so the resultant crystallized<br>
catalyst macroporosity can be manipulated in part by<br>
manipulation of the hydrous kaolin particle size. The<br>
present assignee for example has shown that coarser<br>
hydrous kaolin yields higher macropore volume in<br>
microspheres. Since the present invention comprises<br>
several parameters that effect changes in catalyst<br>
macroporosity, there remains some flexibility in the<br>
choice of the hydrous kaolin particle size.<br>
Calcination of these hydrous kaolins at temperatures<br>
of 1200°F results in endothermic dehydroxylation of the<br>
hydrous kaolin to metakaolin which can be used as the<br>
metakaolin component of the feed slurry.<br>
Silicate for the binder is preferably provided by<br>
sodium silicates with SiO2 to Na2O ratios of from 1.5 to<br>
3.5 and especially preferred ratios of from 2.00 to 3.22.<br>
The non-zeolitic, alumina-containing matrix of the<br>
catalysts of the present invention can further be derived<br>
in part from a hydrous kaolin source that is in the form<br><br>
of an ultrafine powder that is pulverized and calcined<br>
through the exotherm. Typical zeolite microspheres have<br>
been formed with an alumina-containing matrix derived from<br>
kaolin having a larger size than used in this invention<br>
and which is calcined at least substantially through its<br>
characteristic exotherm. Satintone® No. 1, (a<br>
commercially available kaolin that has been calcined<br>
through its characteristic exotherm without any<br>
substantial formation of mullite) is a material used on a<br>
commercial basis to form the alumina-containing matrix.<br>
Satintone® No. 1 is derived from a hydrous kaolin in which<br>
70% of the particles are less than 2 microns. Other<br>
sources having been used to form the alumina-containing<br>
matrix include finely divided hydrous kaolin (e.g., ASP®<br>
600, a commercially available hydrous kaolin described in<br>
Engelhard Technical Bulletin No. TI-1004, entitled<br>
"Aluminum Silicate Pigments" (EC-1167)) calcined at least<br>
substantially through its characteristic exotherm.<br>
Booklet kaolin has found the most widespread commercial<br>
use and has met tremendous success worldwide. Before the<br>
invention disclosed in previously mentioned U.S. Serial<br>
No. 09/956,250, these larger kaolin particles represented<br>
the state of the art in forming the alumina-containing<br>
matrix of the catalyst microsphere and had no perceived<br>
deficits.<br><br>
What is meant by "ultrafine" powder is that at least<br>
90 wt. % of the hydrous kaolin particles must be less than<br>
2 microns in diameter, preferably less than 1 micron<br>
determined by Sedigraph™ (or sedimentation) . It has been<br>
found that, in particular, use of hydrous kaolin pigments<br>
with this particle size distribution upon pulverization<br>
and calcination through the characteristic exotherm<br>
results in a greater quantity of macroporosity in the<br>
catalyst microsphere subsequent to zeolite<br>
crystallization. The loose packing of the calcined<br>
ultrafine kaolin, which has been found, can be likened to<br>
a "house of cards" in which the individual particulates<br>
are aligned randomly with respect to adjacent particles in<br>
a non-parallel manner. Moreover, the calcined ultrafine<br>
kaolin exists as porous aggregates of the "house of cards"<br>
morphology, providing not only a porous aggregate but<br>
additional porous areas between aggregates. Pulverization<br>
of the ultrafine hydrous kaolin is required to provide the<br>
random stacking of the individual kaolin platelets.<br>
The pulverized ultrafine hydrous kaolin, optionally<br>
used to derive a portion of the alumina-containing matrix,<br>
is calcined through its characteristic exotherm with or<br>
without the formation of mullite. An especially preferred<br>
matrix source which can be used in this invention to form<br>
in part the macroporous zeolite microspheres is Ansilex®<br><br>
93. Ansilex® 93 is made from the fine size fraction of a<br>
hard kaolin crude, by spray drying, pulverizing and<br>
calcining to prepare low abrasion pigments as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,586,523, to Fanselow, et. al., the<br>
entire contents of which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference. The ultrafine hydrous matrix source is spray<br>
dried, pulverized and then calcined through the exotherm,<br>
optionally to mullite. The aforementioned U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,493,902 discloses calcining the kaolin to mullite until<br>
the X-ray diffraction intensities are comparable to a<br>
fully crystalline reference standard. While it is within<br>
the scope of the present invention to calcine the<br>
ultrafine hydrous kaolin beyond the exotherm such that the<br>
X-ray diffraction intensities are comparable to a fully<br>
crystalline referenced standard as disclosed in the '902<br>
patent, it is preferred to calcine the ultrafine hydrous<br>
kaolin beyond the characteristic exotherm so as to convert<br>
the kaolin to small crystallite size mullite. The small<br>
crystallite size mullite has the appropriate diffraction<br>
lines and leached chemical composition of a fully<br>
crystalline mullite standard, but the diffractional lines<br>
are weaker inasmuch as the crystallites are smaller. The<br>
relationship between diffraction intensity/line width and<br>
crystallite size is well-known. It is preferred to<br>
calcine the kaolin beyond the exotherm to a small<br><br>
crystallite mullite matrix inasmuch as fully calcining the<br>
kaolin to mullite takes excessive time and temperature in<br>
practice. Furthermore, calcining kaolin beyond the<br>
exotherm to fully crystalline mullite can result in the<br>
macroporosity being lost due to sintering. Moreover, bulk<br>
density after calcining kaolin to fully crystalline<br>
mullite can be substantially increased. Thus, it is<br>
preferred that the ultrafine hydrous kaolin calcined<br>
through the exotherm has 20-80% of the integrated X-ray<br>
diffraction peak areas of a kaolin reference sample<br>
containing well crystallized mullite. More preferably,<br>
the ultrafine kaolin is calcined through the exotherm such<br>
that it has 50-70% of the integrated X-ray diffraction<br>
peak areas of fully crystallized mullite.<br>
What is unusual about the use of the Ansilex®<br>
material is that it is derived from hard kaolin. Hard<br>
kaolins typically have a gray tinge or coloration and are,<br>
thus, also referred to as "gray clays". These hard<br>
kaolins are further characterized by breaking into<br>
irregularly shaped fragments having rough surfaces. Hard<br>
kaolins also contain a significant iron content, typically<br>
about 0.6 to 1 wt. % of Fe203. Hard kaolin clays are<br>
described in Grim's "Applied Clay Mineralogy", 1962,<br>
MaGraw Hill Book Company, pp. 394-398 thereof, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
The use of these materials to form part of the alumina-<br>
containing matrix for in situ FCC microsphere catalysts<br>
has not been known previous to U.S. Serial No. 09/956,250<br>
although their use in the incorporated routes is well<br>
established. Hard kaolins have also occasionally been<br>
used as sources of metakaolin for in situ microspheres,<br>
but not with advantage. Without wishing to be bound by any<br>
theory, it would appear that previous use of the calcined<br>
gray clays in the in situ matrix art would be precluded by<br>
(a) the high iron content thereof and the possibility that<br>
this could lead to coke and gas production, and (b) the<br>
dilatant nature of slurries formed therefrom, leading to<br>
apparently senseless waste of process time and increased<br>
cost in making down high viscosity slurries which spray<br>
dry at low solids. We now believe these dilatancy problems<br>
and porosity benefits are intrinsically and fundamentally<br>
linked. As for the former point, reduced coke and gas was<br>
an especially sought-after object for in situ catalysts,<br>
since the original formulations of Haden made coke and gas<br>
commensurate with their extraordinarily high level of<br>
amorphous matrix activity. This led to lower and lower<br>
levels of iron and spinel in subsequent inventions. It is<br>
a surprising finding that there appears to be no<br>
relationship between the iron and coke and gas<br>
selectivities after all. Instead, substantial<br><br>
improvements in FCC dry gas and coke were obtained through<br>
process modifications like improved feed injection and<br>
riser termination devices reducing contact time.<br>
The matrix can be derived at least in part from<br>
alumina-containing materials more generally characterized<br>
by the porosity thereof provided during the packing of the<br>
calcined material. A test has been developed to determine<br>
the pore volume of the calcined alumina-containing<br>
material which can be used to ultimately form a part of<br>
the matrix of the inventive catalyst. The test<br>
characterizes the water pore volume of the calcined<br>
alumina-containing material by determining the minimum<br>
amount of water needed to make a slurry from a sample of<br>
the solids. In the test, a powder sample is mixed with<br>
water containing a dispersant such as, for example,<br>
Colloid 211, Viking Industries, Atlanta, GA, in a cup<br>
using a stirring rod or spatula. Just enough water is<br>
added to the dry sample to convert the dry powder to a<br>
single mass of dilatant mud which only just begins to flow<br>
under its own weight. The incipient slurry point (ISP) is<br>
calculated from the weights of the sample and water used.<br>
The incipient slurry point can be calculated as follows:<br>
ISP = [(grams of dry sample)/(grams of dry sample plus<br>
grams of water added)] x 100. The units are dimension-less<br>
and are reported as percent solids.<br><br>
This amount of water is larger than the (internal)<br>
water pore volume of the sample, but is clearly related to<br>
the water pore volume. Lower incipient slurry point<br>
percent solids values indicate higher water absorption<br>
capacities or higher pore volume in the sample. The<br>
calcined alumina-containing materials from which the high-<br>
alumina matrix can be at least in part derived in<br>
accordance with this invention will have incipient slurry<br>
points less than 57% solids, preferably 48 to 52% solids.<br>
This compares with Satintone® No. 1 which yields over 58%<br>
solids in the incipient slurry point test.<br>
Accordingly, not only is the ultrafine hydrous kaolin<br>
useful as an alumina-containing material which can be used<br>
to derive a portion of the matrix of the catalyst<br>
microspheres, but the matrix may also be derived in part<br>
from delaminated kaolin, platelet alumina and precipitated<br>
alumina. Means for delaminating booklets or stacks of<br>
kaolin are well-known in the art. Preferred are those<br>
methods, which use a particulate grinding medium such as<br>
sand, or glass microballoons as is well-known. Subsequent<br>
to delamination, the platelets are pulverized to derive<br>
the random packing or "house of cards" morphology.<br>
An advantage of the matrix precursors meeting the ISP<br>
test specification is that they bring higher pore volume<br>
per unit matrix surface area. This maximizes the<br><br>
effectiveness of the catalyst by minimizing both catalytic<br>
coke (pore volume) and contaminant coke (matrix surface<br>
area) .<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention to<br>
derive the matrix in part from chemically synthesized<br>
spinel and/or mullite. Thus, Okata, et al.,<br>
"Characterization of spinel phase from SiO2-Al2O3 xerogels<br>
and the formation process of mullite", Journal of the<br>
American Ceramic Society, 69 [9] 652-656 (1986), the<br>
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference disclose that two kinds of xerogels can be<br>
prepared by slow and rapid hydrolysis of tetraethyoxy<br>
silane and aluminum nitrate nonahydrdate dissolved in<br>
ethanol. The slow hydrolysis method involves gelling the<br>
above mixture in an oven at 60° C. for one to two weeks<br>
whereas the rapid hydrolysis method involves adding<br>
ammonium hydroxide solution to the mixture and drying in<br>
air. Xerogels prepared by the slow hydrolysis method<br>
crystallized mullite directly from the amorphous state on<br>
firing whereas the xerogels formed by rapid hydrolysis<br>
crystallized a spinel phase before mullite formation. As<br>
long as such calcined synthetic materials have a water<br>
pore volume within the scope of this invention, such<br>
materials can be used to derive at least in part the high-<br>
alumina matrix of the catalyst of this invention.<br><br>
In order to passivate contaminant metals, such as<br>
nickel and vanadium, the catalyst matrix may further<br>
include an alumina source derived from highly dispersible<br>
boehmite. Other aluminas such as pseudo-boehmite with low<br>
dispersibility, and gibbsite can be used, but are not as<br>
effective. Dispersibility of the hydrated alumina is the<br>
property of the alumina to disperse effectively in an<br>
acidic media such as formic acid of pH less than about<br>
3.5. Such acid treatment is known as peptizing the<br>
alumina. High dispersion is when 90% or more of the<br>
alumina disperses into particles less than about 1 micron.<br>
The surface area (BET, nitrogen) of the crystalline<br>
boehmite, as well as the gamma - delta alumina conversion<br>
product, upon calcination is below 150 m2/g, preferably<br>
below 125 m2/g, and most preferably below 100 m2/g, e.g. 30<br>
- 80 m2/g.<br>
Following are typical properties of fully peptizable<br>
and dispersible crystalline boehmites which can be used in<br>
practice of the invention<br><br><br>
Monoprotic acids, preferably formic, can be used to<br>
peptize the crystalline boehmite. Other acids that can be<br>
employed to peptize the alumina are nitric and acetic.<br>
During production, the crystalline boehmite is<br>
calcined prior to incorporation into the microsphere. As<br>
a result of calcination, the crystalline boehmite is<br>
converted to a porous gamma phase and to a lesser extent a<br>
delta alumina. The BET surface area of this material only<br>
increases marginally, e.g., increases from 80 m2/g to 100<br>
m2/g. The calcined boehmite converted to the gamma phase<br>
is added to the slurry of hydrous kaolin, metakaolin, and<br>
other alumina matrix components and spray dried into the<br>
microspheres. Upon zeolite crystallization, the gamma<br>
alumina will not be leached from the microspheres by the<br>
alkaline silicate solution. When the dispersed alumina<br>
solution is calcined and spray dried with the kaolin and<br>
binder, the resulting microsphere contains uniformly<br>
distributed gamma alumina throughout the microsphere.<br>
Preferably, the pore volume of the crystallized<br>
zeolite microsphere of this invention, which is formed<br>
using hydrous kaolin to form the catalyst matrix, is<br>
greater than 0.15 cc/gm, more preferably greater than 0.25<br>
cc/gm, and most preferably greater than 0.30 cc/gm of Hg<br>
in the range of 40-20,000A diameter. More particularly,<br>
the catalyst of this invention has a macropore volume<br><br>
within pores having a size range of 600 to 20,000A of at<br>
least 0.07 cc/gm of Hg, and preferably at least 0.10 cc/gm<br>
of Hg. While conventional zeolite-incorporated catalysts<br>
have macroporosities comparable to the catalysts of this<br>
invention, the incorporated catalysts do not have the<br>
novel zeolite-on-matrix morphology nor performance of the<br>
catalysts of this invention. The catalysts of this<br>
invention will have a BET surface area less than 500 m2/g,<br>
preferably less than 475 m2/g and most preferably within a<br>
range of about 300-450 m2/g. The moderate surface area of<br>
the catalysts of this invention in combination with the<br>
macroporosity achieves the desired activity and<br>
selectivities to gasoline while reducing gas and coke<br>
yields.<br>
One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that<br>
it is the steam-aged surface area and activity that is<br>
truly significant and which must be balanced against the<br>
available pore volume. The cited preferred surface areas<br>
for finished product (fresh) catalyst are chosen such that<br>
the surface area after a 1500° F, four hour steaming at 1<br>
atm steam pressure are generally below 300 m2/gm.<br>
It has further been found that the macroporosity of<br>
the catalyst of this invention is maintained even if a<br>
portion of the matrix is derived from calcined or<br>
additional coarse alumina-containing materials which<br><br>
otherwise have a low water pore volume as determined by<br>
the ISP test described above.<br>
A quantity (e.g., 3 to 30% by weight of the kaolin)<br>
of zeolite initiator may also be added to the aqueous<br>
slurry before it is spray dried. As used herein, the term<br>
"zeolite initiator" shall include any material containing<br>
silica and alumina that either allows a zeolite<br>
crystallization process that would not occur in the<br>
absence of the initiator or shortens significantly the<br>
zeolite crystallization process that would occur in the<br>
absence of the initiator. Such materials are also known<br>
as "zeolite seeds". The zeolite initiator may or may not<br>
exhibit detectable crystallinity by x-ray diffraction.<br>
Adding zeolite initiator to the aqueous slurry of<br>
kaolin before it is spray dried into microspheres is<br>
referred to herein as "internal seeding". Alternatively,<br>
zeolite initiator may be mixed with the kaolin<br>
microspheres after they are formed and before the<br>
commencement of the crystallization process, a technique<br>
which is referred to herein as "external seeding".<br>
The zeolite initiator used in the present invention<br>
may be provided from a number of sources. For example,<br>
the zeolite initiator may comprise recycled fines produced<br>
during the crystallization process itself. Other zeolite<br>
initiators that may be used include fines produced during<br><br>
the crystallization process of another zeolite product or<br>
an amorphous zeolite initiator in a sodium silicate<br>
solution. As used herein, "amorphous zeolite initiator"<br>
shall mean a zeolite initiator that exhibits no detectable<br>
crystallinity by x-ray diffraction.<br>
The seeds may be prepared as disclosed by in<br>
4,493,902. Especially preferred seeds are disclosed in<br>
4,631,262.<br>
After spray drying, the microspheres may be calcined<br>
at low temperature, e.g., for two to four hours in a<br>
muffle furnace at a chamber temperature of less than 1000°<br>
F. It is important that during calcination the hydrated<br>
kaolin component of the microspheres is not converted to<br>
metakaolin, leaving the hydrous kaolin, and optional<br>
spinel or gamma alumina components of the microspheres<br>
essentially unchanged. Alternatively, if the microspheres<br>
are formed with a sodium silicate binder, the microspheres<br>
may be acid-neutralized to enhance ion exchange of the<br>
catalysts after crystallization. The acid-neutralization<br>
process comprises co-feeding uncalcined, spray dried<br>
microspheres and mineral acid to a stirred slurry at<br>
controlled pH. The rates of addition of solids and acid<br>
are adjusted to maintain a pH of about 2 to 7, most<br>
preferably from about 2.5 to 4.5 with a target of about 3<br>
pH. The sodium silicate binder is gelled to silica and a<br><br>
soluble sodium salt, which is subsequently filtered and<br>
washed free from the microspheres. The silica gel-bound<br>
microspheres are then calcined at low tempature.<br>
Y-faujasite is allowed to crystallize by mixing the<br>
kaolin microspheres with the appropriate amounts of other<br>
constituents (including at least sodium silicate and<br>
water), as discussed in detail below, and then heating the<br>
resulting slurry to a temperature and for a time (e.g., to<br>
200°-215° F. for 10-24 hours) sufficient to crystallize Y-<br>
faujasite in the microspheres. The prescriptions of<br>
4,493,902 may be followed as written. Equivalent,<br>
reformatted recipes are provided as follows, however.<br>
The crystallization recipes we employ are based on a<br>
set of assumptions and certain raw materials. The seeds<br>
are described by 4,631,262 and are preferably used<br>
externally. The SiO2, A1203, and Na20 components of<br>
metakaolin, seeds, sodium silicate solution, calcined<br>
sodium silicate binder, and silica gel are assumed to be<br>
100% reactive. The silica-alumina and alumina derived<br>
from the hydrous kaolin and calcined boehmite,<br>
respectively, are assumed to be completely unreactive for<br>
zeolite synthesis. The alumina and silica in kaolin<br>
calcined through the exotherm to the spinel form are<br>
assumed to be 1% and 90% reactive respectively. Although<br>
these two values are in use, they are not believed to be<br><br>
accurate. The alumina and silica in kaolin calcined<br>
through the exotherm to the mullite form are assumed to be<br>
0% and 67% reactive, respectively. These two values are<br>
believed to be accurate, representing the inertness of 3:2<br>
mullite in crystallization and the full solubility of the<br>
free silica phase. Since metakaolin alumina is the<br>
limiting reagent in the synthesis and the volume of<br>
zeolite is much larger than the corresponding volume of<br>
metakaolin, it is important to limit the zeolite yield<br>
appropriately for a given microsphere pore volume.<br>
Otherwise, there will result little or no residual pore<br>
volume after crystallization. Such is the case for the<br>
prior art. On the other hand, if insufficient limiting<br>
reagent is available in the microsphere to grow sufficient<br>
zeolite to appropriately strengthen the catalyst,<br>
additional nutrient alumina may be added in the form of<br>
metakaolin microspheres, as is well known in this art.<br>
Thus, tight process control is enabled for pore volume and<br>
attrition resistance.<br>
Using these assumptions, the following weight ratios<br>
for reactive components are used in the overall<br>
crystallization recipes. Inert components do not enter<br>
into the ratios, except in the case of the seeds dose,<br>
which is defined as the ratio of the grams of seeds A1203<br>
to total grams of microspheres.<br><br><br>
The sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide reactants<br>
may be added to the crystallization reactor from a variety<br>
of sources. For example, the reactants may be provided as<br>
an aqueous mixture of N® Brand sodium silicate and sodium<br>
hydroxide. As another example, at least part of the<br>
sodium silicate may be provided by the mother liquor<br>
produced during the crystallization of another zeolite-<br>
containing product.<br>
After the crystallization process is terminated, the<br>
microspheres containing Y-faujasite are separated from at<br>
least a substantial portion of their mother liquor, e.g.,<br>
by filtration. It may be desirable to wash to<br>
microspheres by contacting them with water either during<br>
or after the filtration step. The purpose of the washing<br>
step is to remove mother liquor that would otherwise be<br>
left entrained within the microspheres.<br>
"Silica Retention" may be practiced. The teachings<br>
of U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902 at column 12, lines 3-31,<br>
regarding silica retention are incorporated herein by<br>
cross-reference.<br><br>
After crystallization by reaction in a seeded sodium<br>
silicate solution, the microspheres contain crystalline Y-<br>
faujasite in the sodium form. In order to obtain a<br>
product having acceptable catalytic properties, it is<br>
necessary to replace sodium cations in the microspheres<br>
with more desirable cations. This may be accomplished by<br>
contacting the microspheres with solutions containing<br>
ammonium or rare earth cations or both. The ion exchange<br>
step or steps are preferably carried out so that the<br>
resulting catalyst contains less than about 0.7%, most<br>
preferably less than about 0.5% and most preferably less<br>
than about 0.4%, by weight Na2O. After ion exchange, the<br>
microspheres are dried to obtain the microspheres of the<br>
present invention. In order to make 0 (zero) wt. % rare<br>
earth (REO) catalysts, the Na+ cations are exchanged by<br>
using only an ammonium salt such as NH4NO3 and without<br>
using any rare earth salt during exchange. Such 0 (zero)<br>
wt. % REO catalysts are especially beneficial as FCC<br>
catalysts that give higher octane gasoline and more<br>
olefinic product. Rare earth versions of catalysts of<br>
this invention, post treated after crystallization by ion-<br>
exchange with high levels of rare earth, e.g., by<br>
procedures such as described in the '902 patent, are<br>
useful when exceptionally high activity is sought and the<br>
octane rating of the FCC gasoline produce is not of prime<br><br>
importance. Rare earth levels in the range of 0.1% to 12%<br>
usually between 0.5% and 7% (weight basis) are<br>
contemplated. Following ammonium and rare earth exchange,<br>
the catalyst is calcined at 1100°-1200° F. for 1-2 hours<br>
and unit cell size of the Y zeolite is reduced.<br>
Preferably, this calcination is done in a covered tray<br>
with 25% free moisture present.<br>
The preferred catalyst of the invention comprises<br>
microspheres containing at least 15% and preferably from<br>
40 to 65% by weight Y faujasite, expressed on the basis of<br>
the as-crystallized sodium faujasite form zeolite. As<br>
used herein, the term Y faujasite shall include synthetic<br>
faujasite zeolites exhibiting, in the sodium form, an X-<br>
ray diffraction pattern of the type described in Breck,<br>
Zeolite Molecular Sieves, p. 369, Table 4.90 (1974), and<br>
having a crystalline unit cell size, in the sodium form<br>
(after washing any crystallization mother liquor from the<br>
zeolite), of less than about 24.75 A as determined by the<br>
technique described in the ASTM standard method of testing<br>
titled "Determination of the Unit Cell Size Dimension of a<br>
Faujasite Type Zeolite" (Designation D3942-80) or by an<br>
equivalent technique. The term Y faujasite shall<br>
encompass the zeolite in its sodium form as well as in the<br>
known modified forms, including, e.g., rare earth and<br>
ammonium exchanged forms and stabilized forms. The<br><br><br>
Conditions useful in operating FCC units utilizing<br>
catalyst of the invention are well-known in the art and<br>
are contemplated in using the catalysts of the invention.<br>
These conditions are described in numerous publications<br>
including Catal. Rev. - Sci. Eng., 18 (1), 1-150 (1978),<br>
which is incorporated herein by cross-reference. The<br>
catalysts of this invention that contain the calcined<br>
dispersable boehmite are particularly useful in cracking<br>
residuum and resid-containing feeds having a Ni+V metals<br>
content of at least 2,000 ppm and a Conradson carbon<br>
content greater than 1.0.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention, like all<br>
commercial fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, will be<br>
hydrothermally deactivated during the operation of the<br>
cracking unit. Accordingly, as used herein, the phrase<br>
"cracking the petroleum feedstock in the presence of a<br>
catalyst" shall include cracking the petroleum feedstock<br>
in the presence of the catalyst in its fresh, partially<br>
deactivated, or fully deactivated form.<br>
From the prior art discussed previously, it was<br>
thought that the less porous catalyst microspheres were<br>
superior products in view of the excellent attrition<br>
resistance, high activity and selectivity provided,<br><br>
especially in light of the well established fact that<br>
these catalysts have selectivity at least equivalent to<br>
lower surface area, higher pore volume catalysts, and<br>
frequently better selectivity at short contact time.<br>
Assertions to the contrary would easily be dismissed as<br>
self-serving and would also be tantamount to saying the<br>
so-called incorporated catalysts were diffusion-limited at<br>
short residence time. It has only recently been<br>
discovered that under the short contact time FCC<br>
processing, FCC catalysts technologies may be diffusion<br>
limited with respect to transport in pores external to the<br>
zeolite. This is proposed to be the reason that the API<br>
gravity of the bottoms fraction has often risen after SCT<br>
revamp. Less obvious than that, it now appears that<br>
conventional, prior art catalysts fail to provide all of<br>
the potential gains of the SCT hardware. But heretofore<br>
there was no way to know what benefits were absent.<br>
Accordingly, the catalyst microspheres of this invention<br>
have a substantially different morphology than the<br>
previous catalyst microspheres, especially with respect to<br>
the increased pore volume, zeolite-on-matrix morphology,<br>
and moderate surface area. Attrition resistance of these<br>
catalysts is good and effective for the SCT FCC processing<br>
conditions.<br><br>
The method of preparation and subsequent properties<br>
such as mercury pore volume, the catalyst of this<br>
invention includes a macroporous matrix in which the<br>
macropores of the matrix are formed from a random<br>
configuration of porous matrix planar structures which are<br>
lined with the zeolite crystals. Thus, the macropores of<br>
the catalyst are lined with the active zeolite crystals.<br>
The macroporosity of the catalyst allows the hydrocarbons<br>
to enter the catalyst freely and the increased macropore<br>
surface area thereof allows such hydrocarbons to contact<br>
the catalytic surfaces. Importantly, the hydrocarbons can<br>
contact the zeolite unobstructed, rendering the catalyst<br>
very active and selective to gasoline. While conventional<br>
incorporated zeolite catalysts, in which the zeolite<br>
crystals are incorporated within a binder and/or matrix,<br>
have a highly porous matrix, at least a portion of the<br>
binder coats or otherwise obstructs the zeolite crystals.<br>
In the present microspheroidal catalysts, there is no need<br>
for a separate physical binder which glues the zeolite to<br>
the matrix surface other than any minute amounts of<br>
silicate which may remain subsequent to zeolite<br>
crystallization. It is believed that the microsphere<br>
catalysts formed in accordance with the process of the<br>
present invention yield the highest accessibility to the<br>
zeolite of any zeolite/matrix catalyst.<br><br>
Also optionally present in a highly dispersed state<br>
are the particles of metal-passivating alumina. While<br>
there is a preponderance of zeolite lining the macropore<br>
walls of the invention, smaller particles presumed to be<br>
formed from the dispersed boehmite and/or mullite are also<br>
seen.<br>
It has been found that the microspheroidal catalysts<br>
of the present invention provide high conversions via low<br>
coke_selectivity and higher selectivities to gasoline<br>
relative to previous FCC catalysts presently on the<br>
market. It is surprising that this catalyst can<br>
consistently outperform conventional incorporated<br>
catalysts of similar or even higher porosity and lower<br>
surface area. This shows that having added porosity alone<br>
is not sufficient. It is now believed that the novel<br>
structured catalysts, being both macroporous and with the<br>
macropore walls lined with zeolite and with the mesoporous<br>
or microporous matrix substantially behind the zeolite<br>
layer are the reasons the catalyst excels at gasoline, LCO<br>
and coke selectivity. The present catalyst is sufficient<br>
to crack the heavier hydrocarbons and anticipated to<br>
improve the API gravity of the bottom fraction, especially<br>
during the short contact time processing.<br>
The examples, which follow, illustrate the present<br>
invention:<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The microspheres of this Example were made in a pilot<br>
plant with nozzle-type atomizer. The following components<br>
as set forth in Table 3 were mixed in a Cowles mixer and<br>
spray dried. The sodium silicate was added directly to<br>
the slurry, resulting in flocculation. Solids were<br>
adjusted appropriately in order to enable spray drying.<br><br>
The microspheres were calcined at 700°F for 4 hours<br>
before further use.<br>
EXAMPLES 2 and 3<br>
Two reactions were run to grow zeolite in the<br>
microsphere of Example 1 with and without the addition of<br>
a microsphere containing 100% metakaolin to adjust zeolite<br>
content. The reaction components for each example are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
The corresponding ratios of reactive components were<br>
SiO2/Na2O=2.70 w/w, H2O/Na2O =7.0 w/w, SiO2/Al2O3=7.0 w/w and<br>
seeds Al2O3/grams microsphere of 0.0044 w/w. The as-<br>
crystallized sample of Example 2 had a Hg pore volume of<br>
0.31 cc/g (40-20K pore diameter).<br>
Properties of the finished product of Example 3 were as<br>
follows:<br><br>
EXAMPLES 4 and 5<br>
The microspheres of Examples 4 and 5 contain<br>
ultrafine kaolin(Ansilex 93®) calcined through the<br>
characteristic exotherm and were spray dried at a Pilot<br>
plant with a wheel-type atomizer. The weight percentages<br><br>
of each component forming the spray dried slurry are shown<br>
in Table 5. The weight percentage of each kaolin<br>
component is on a binder-free basis.<br><br>
The spray dried microspheres were calcined at 700°F<br>
for 4 hours before further use.<br>
EXAMPLES 6 and 7<br>
Two reactions were run to grow zeolite using the<br>
microspheres of Examples 4 and 5. The reaction components<br>
for each example are shown in Table 6.<br><br><br>
Properties of the finished products of Examples 6 and 7<br>
are shown below.<br><br><br>
The finished products of Examples 3, 6, and 7 show<br>
similar macropore size distribution with peak maxima in<br>
the range of 500-700A in radius. The introduction of<br>
Ansilex-93® gives rise to an increased pore volume in the<br>
range of 25-30 A pore radius. All of the above<br>
catalyst examples did not contain metal tolerant alumina<br>
and are intended for cracking of a feed with a minimum<br>
metals content.<br>
EXAMPLES 8 and 9<br>
These examples disclose the preparation of<br>
microsphere containing metal tolerant alumina. In<br>
general, metal tolerant highly dispersable boehmite was<br>
first calcined at 1450°F for 2h to gamma alumina. The<br>
gamma alumina was then milled to reduce APS to about 2<br>
microns in aqueous media. The milled gamma alumina<br>
slurry, either peptized or not, was added to a slurry<br>
containing metakaolin, hydrous kaolin, and Ansilex-93® when<br>
applicable, in a Cowles mixer. Sodium silicate (3.22<br>
SiO2/Na2O) was then added into the slurry, along with<br><br>
sufficient water to form a mixture suitable for<br>
atomization. The slurry was spray dried in a pilot plant<br>
with a wheel-type atomizer. The weight percentages of<br>
each component of the slurry are set forth in Table 7.<br>
Again, the percentages of the alumina components are on a<br>
binder-free basis.<br><br>
The spray dried microspheres were calcined at 700°F<br>
for 4h and were used for the following crystallization.<br><br><br>
The properties of the finished product of Examples 10<br>
and 11 are shown below.<br><br>
EXAMPLES 12-16<br>
These examples measure the performance of the<br>
catalysts of the present invention (Examples 3, 6, and 7)<br>
against that of two comparative examples. The two<br>
comparative examples represent the catalysts of U.S.<br>
Serial No. 09/956,250 (Comparative 1) and U.S. 5,395,908<br>
(Comparative 2. The catalyst samples were laboratory<br>
deactivated at 1450°F for 4h in 100% steam. The<br>
deactivated catalysts were then tested in an ACE™<br>
fluidized bed test unit at 970°F with 1.125" injector<br>
height with an aromatic feed having a Conradson carbon of<br>
about 6%. The activity was changed by changing the amount<br>
of active FCC catalyst. The total amount of inert<br>
microspheres and active catalyst in the ACE unit was kept<br>
constant at 12.0 g. The yields are reported at 70%<br>
convention.<br><br><br><br>
Compared to the Comparative 2 sample, the current<br>
invention clearly demonstrates the improved gasoline yield<br>
and bottom cracking, especially in the presence of small<br>
amounts of bottom upgrading matrix (spinel and/or<br>
mullite)in the microsphere. In general, the presence of<br>
macroposity and bottom upgrading matrix (spinel and/or<br>
mullite) greatly improves the yields of the desired<br>
products.<br>
EXAMPLES 17-21<br>
Examples below measure the performance of catalysts<br>
of the present invention (Examples 10 and 11) against<br>
catalysts of U.S. Serial No. 09/956,250 (Comparative 3),<br>
U.S. Serial No. 09/978,180, filed October 17, 2001<br>
(Comparative 4), and U.S. Serial No. 10/164,488, filed<br>
June 6, 2002 (Comparative 5) . Comparative catalysts 4 and<br>
5 represent a class of catalysts for residuum cracking.<br>
The catalyst samples were presteamed at 1350°F for 2h in<br>
100% steam, and 3000/3000 PPM Nickel and Vanadium were<br>
added via incipient wetness using nickel octoate and<br>
vanadium naphthenate, followed by poststeaming at 1450°F<br>
for 4h in a mixture of 90% steam and 10% air. The<br>
performance of each catalyst was then measured using ACE<br><br>
following the protocols described in the above Examples.<br>
Yields were compared at 70% conversion.<br><br>
The catalysts of current invention show dramatic<br>
improvement in gasoline yield and bottom upgrading<br>
compared to comparative samples 3 and 4. The inventive<br>
catalysts also provide the lowest H2 yield among the<br>
catalysts tested, indicating better metal passivation.<br>
EXAMPLES 22-24<br>
These examples also show improved metal passivation<br>
of the catalysts of the present invention against the<br>
Comparative 5 catalyst and a commercial resid catalyst<br>
(Comparative 6) . The ACE data were generated from the<br>
catalysts deactivated in a different way compared to those<br>
in Examples 17-21. The three samples were laboratory<br>
deactivated in a prestream, fluid bed crack on nickel and<br>
vanadium, post steam deactivation protocol. Typical Ni<br>
and V loadings were 2800 PPM and 3600 PPM respectively.<br>
The deactivated catalysts were then tested in an ACE unit<br>
at 8 WHSV, 2.125" injector height, and 998°F crack<br><br>
temperature with the same feed as that used in the<br>
examples above. The amount of catalyst in the ACE unit<br>
was constant at 9.0 g and the activity was changed by<br>
changing the amount of oil delivered. Product yields were<br>
given at 75% conversion.<br><br>
Again, the catalyst of current invention results in a<br>
dramatic improvement in metal passivation as indicated by<br>
the low H2 yield. The catalyst of Example 10 contains no<br>
bottom cracking matrix such as spinel or mullite.<br>
Modification of this catalyst with the addition of small<br>
amounts of spinel and/or mullite would improve the bottom<br>
upgrading with little or no penalty in metal passivation.<br><br>
