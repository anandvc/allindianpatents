FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to optical communication, and in particular, to a method and devices<br>
for transmitting client signals in an Optical Transport Network (OTN).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
With the development of economy, people's demand for information increases rapidly. Fibers<br>
provide an enormous potential capacity of about 30 THz, and the fiber communication becomes<br>
one of the most important technologies that support growth of the communication services. The<br>
OTN standard system developed by the International Telecommunication Union -<br>
Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) lays a foundation for constructing a perfect<br>
basic OTN.<br>
In an OTN, the technology for mapping and wrapping client signals to make them suitable for<br>
being transmitted in the OTN is called a Digital Wrapping (DW) technology. The DW technology<br>
involves the technical means such as Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTU) mapping,<br>
multiplexing structure, time division multiplexing of Optical Channel Data Unit-k (ODUk), and<br>
client signal mapping.<br>
Before transmitting client signals, it is necessary to map the client signals to an Optical Channel<br>
Payload Unit-j (OPUj, where j represents the supported bit rate and may have the values of 1, 2, or<br>
3 which indicate a bit rate of about 2.5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 40 Gbps respectively), and add the<br>
overhead of the OPUj into the client signal to constitute an OPUj, and then add the channel<br>
overhead of the Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUj) into the OPUj to constitute an ODUj. The<br>
OTU overhead and the Forward Error Correction (FEC) overhead are added into the ODUj to<br>
constitute an Optical Channel Transport Unit-j (OTUj), and then the OTUj is loaded to a<br>
wavelength and sent out.<br>
Time division multiplexing may be performed for the ODUj first so that the client signals can be<br><br>
transmitted through a transport channel of higher rates. Therefore, the G.709 recommendation<br>
defines an Optical Channel Payload Unit-k Tributary Slot (OPUk TS) and an Optical Channel Data<br>
Tributary Unit j into k (ODTUjk), where k represents the supported bit rate and is greater than j.<br>
On the basis of such definition, each byte of the ODUj is mapped to each byte of the ODTUjk in<br>
the asynchronous mode, and then the ODTUjk is mapped to the OPUk TS. Finally, an OTUk is<br>
constituted for transmitting.<br>
In the step of mapping the client signal to the OPU, in order to transmit client signals of different<br>
types, the OTN specifications provide multiple service mapping methods such as mapping of the<br>
signals of a Constant Bit Rate (CBR), mapping of the Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) frame,<br>
and mapping of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell flows, which are defined in the<br>
G.709. With the growth of the data services, new requirements are raised for the full-rate<br>
transparent transmission capability of the OTN, and the application of the CBR mapping mode is<br>
wider and wider.<br>
The G.709 living list SP13 puts forward an agnostic CBR mapping method. FIG. 1 shows a frame<br>
structure suitable to this CBR mapping. Starting from the 15th column, each OPUk frame includes:<br>
a 6-byte Cbyte, where the Cbyte indicates the number of bytes of the mapped client signal; an<br>
OPUk payload area composed of (4*3808+1) bytes, for storing client signals; and a 1-byte<br>
Payload Structure Identifier (PSI). On the basis of frame structure as shown in FIG. 1, the client<br>
signal is mapped to the payload area of the OTN frame of the agnostic CBR service through the<br>
existing Σ-‪ algorithm.<br>
In the process of implementing the present invention, the inventor finds that the existing agnostic<br>
CBR mapping method uses the fixed frame structure in FIG. 1 to map the client signals. When the<br>
rate of the client signal is lower than the nominal value of the OPUk, the positions not stuffed with<br>
client signals in the OPUk need to be stuffed with invalid bytes in order to meet the requirements<br>
of CBR transmission in the OTN system, thus leading to low bandwidth utilization ratio of the<br>
transmission channel. Especially in the case that the client signal rate is low as compared with the<br>
nominal value of the OPUk, the OPUk needs to be stuffed with many invalid bytes, thus reducing<br>
the bandwidth utilization ratio of the transmission channel drastically. Besides, the definition of<br>
the OPUk TS structure in the existing G709 is limited to the multiplexing from the ODUj to the<br>
ODUk, and the existing G709 defines only 4 OPUk TSs or 16 OPUk TSs as regards the TS<br>
allocation. Moreover, the existing G.709 defines only the mapping path of the SDH service as<br>
regards the mapping of the CBR service.<br>
With the rapid development of data services, more and more information is transmitted over the<br>
Ethernet, Fiber Channel (FC), and Enterprise Systems Connection (ESCON) interface, and such<br><br>
interfaces provide numerous bit rates. For the client signals of numerous bit rates, the OTN system<br>
defines only the CBR transmission channels and limited CBR mapping methods, and provides no<br>
flexible mapping method suitable for CBR transparent transmission of the client signals of<br>
different bit rates.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, the OPUk TSs are grouped and allocated according<br>
to the rate of different client signals on the basis of the OPUk frame structure to improve<br>
efficiency and flexibility of transmitting various client signals, and the agnostic CBR mapping<br>
mode in the ITU-T SG15 G.709 living list is applied to implement transparent CBR transmission<br>
for various client signals of different rates.<br>
A method for transmitting client signals in an OTN in an embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes:<br>
obtaining the client signals, and determining an OPUk TS in an OPUk according to the<br>
client signals;<br>
mapping the client signals to the OPUk TS in an agnostic CBR mapping mode; and<br>
adding an overhead into the OPUk, and sending the OPUk with the added overhead to an<br>
OTN.<br>
The step of determining the OPUk TS in the OPUk according to the client signals specifically<br>
includes:<br>
determining the number of OPUk TSs of the OPUk according to the type of the client<br>
signal and the bit rate of the OPUk; and<br>
determining the OPUk TS by using the number of OPUk TSs as a cycle.<br>
This step may further include:<br>
stuffing the fixed byte positions of the OPUk with invalid data, so that the number of<br>
non-stuffed bytes of the OPUk is an integer multiple of the number of the OPUk TSs;<br>
determining the number of the OPUk TSs according to the type of the client signals and<br>
the bit rate of the OPUk; and<br>
determining the OPUk TS by using the number of the OPUk TSs as a cycle.<br>
This step may further include:<br>
grouping the determined OPUk TSs of the OPUk, and letting the OPUk TSs in the same<br>
group constitute a channel for transmitting client signals.<br>
The step of mapping the client signals to the OPUk TS in the OPUk in an agnostic CBR mapping<br>
mode includes:<br>
determining the number of bytes of the first client signal according to the rate of the first<br>
client signal among the client signals and the OPUk TS rate corresponding to the first client signal;<br>
mapping the number of bytes of the first client signal to the overhead of the OPUk TS<br><br>
corresponding to the first client signal; and<br>
mapping the bytes of a client signal of this number of bytes to the OPUk TS<br>
corresponding to the first client signal.<br>
The step of mapping the client signals to the OPUk TS in the OPUk in an agnostic CBR mapping<br>
mode includes:<br>
mapping the first client signal among the client signals to the OPUk TS corresponding to<br>
the first client signal in an agnostic CBR mapping mode; and<br>
mapping the second client signal among the client signals to the OPUk TS corresponding<br>
to the second client signal in a GFP mapping mode or an ATM cell mapping mode.<br>
Preferably, the method may further include:<br>
adding a control identifier into the overhead added in the OPUk for at least one of the<br>
following purposes: identifying the OPUk TS corresponding to each client signal, identifying the<br>
number of OPUk TSs in the OPUk, identifying the type of the client signals mapped in the OPUk<br>
TS, and identifying the mode of mapping the client signal to the OPUk TS.<br>
In order to make the present invention clearer to those skilled in the art, the following describes the<br>
present invention further in detail with reference to accompanying drawings and preferred<br>
embodiments.<br>
The frame structure under the present invention is an improved frame structure based on the OPUk,<br>
and is called Optical Channel Payload Unit-k Agnostic tributary slot n (OPUk aTS-n), which refers<br>
to grouping into n agnostic TSs of the OPUk.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an OPUk aTS-n frame structure according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The improvement made by the present invention to the existing frame structure is<br>
described below with reference to FIG 2.<br>
FIG. 2 shows 6 OTN frames, which include 3808 columns numbered 17-3824. Each OTN frame<br>
includes four rows. Therefore, the OPUk payload area includes a total of 4x3808 bytes. As shown<br>
in FIG. 2, the OPUk frame in this embodiment is divided into 4 OPUk TSs (namely, the value of n<br>
is 4) to constitute an OPUk aTS-4 frame structure. Because 3808/4 = 952, the 3808 bytes in each<br>
row enable the 4 OPUk TSs to complete 952 cycles; one OPUk makes the 4 OPUk TSs complete<br>
(952x4 = 3808) cycles, namely, each OPUk TS of an OTN frame is available for transmitting 3808<br>
bytes, and each OPUk TS needs to pass through 4 OTN frames in order to complete transmission<br>
of (3808x4) bytes.<br>
The client signals are transmitted based on the frame structure shown in FIG. 2. If the value of k in<br>
the OPUk is 1, the frame rate is about 2.5 Gbps, and the transmission rate of each OPUk TS<br>
(accurate to 5 decimal places) is up to 0.62208 Gbps in the case that the OPUk is divided into 4<br><br>
OPUk TSs. Likewise, if k = 2, the frame rate is about 10 Gbps, and the transmission rate of each<br>
OPUk TS (accurate to 5 decimal places) is up to 2.49882 Gbps in the case that the OPUk is<br>
divided into 4 OPUk TSs.<br>
The n (number) of OPUk TSs in the OPUk payload area depends on the rate of the client signal<br>
and the type and number of client signals so that each OPUk TS can use the agnostic CBR service<br>
mapping method to transmit each client signal transparently, and the maximum possible frequency<br>
offset of the client signals is tolerable. If it is impossible to divide the 3808 columns of the OPUk<br>
payload area into n OPUk TSs, certain columns in the OPUk payload area are stuffed fixedly. The<br>
number of columns to be stuffed is mod(3808/n).<br>
FIG. 3 shows an OPUk aTS-11 frame structure according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 3, because mod(3808/n) = 2, the last two columns (column 3823 and<br>
column 3824) in the OPUk payload area are stuffed with invalid data in this embodiment. After<br>
two bytes in each row are stuffed, the remaining 3806 bytes enable the 11 OPUk TSs to complete<br>
346 cycles. After column 3823 and column 3824 are stuffed, the 11 OPUk TSs complete (346 × 4<br>
= 1384) cycles, namely, each OPUk TS of an OTN frame completes transmission of 1384 bytes.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a method of stuffing column 3823 and column 3824 in the OPUk payload area. In<br>
this embodiment, the fixedly stuffed column in the OPUk payload area is placed at the end of the<br>
OPUk frame uniformly to facilitate identification. However, the embodiments of the present<br>
invention do not restrict the position of the fixedly stuffed column.<br>
On the basis of the grouping the OPUk TSs of the OPUk payload area, in order to be agnostic to<br>
the frame division, the embodiments of the present invention use reserved byte addition identifiers<br>
to indicate grouping of the OPUk TSs of the OPUk payload area, including: payload type identifier,<br>
multi-frame identifier, identifier of the type of the client signal, and OPUk TS group identifier. The<br>
identifiers employed herein are introduced below.<br>
The frame structure defined herein is identified by a PSI[0] byte (namely, Payload Type (PT) byte)<br>
defined in the existing OTN frame structure. For example, PSI[0] is set as a value which is idle in<br>
the prior art, and this value is used herein to indicate an agnostic OPUk frame structure composed<br>
of n OPUk TSs (briefly known as OPUk aTS-n).<br>
It is assumed that PSI[0]=13 indicates the OPUk aTS-n structure herein. In the case that PSI[0]=13,<br>
the embodiments of the present invention use the reserved overhead byte in the OPUk overhead<br>
(OH) to set the value of the PSI[1] (as shown in FIG. 3, the PSI occupies a byte in row 4 and<br>
column 15 of the frame). The PSI[1] value is adapted to indicate the number (n) of the OPUk TSs<br>
in the OPUk payload area.<br>
A multi-frame indication method is used to indicate the OPUk TS corresponding to 3 Cbyte's of<br><br>
the current frame. Therefore, a multi-frame cycle identifier identical to the number of OPUk TSs is<br>
required. The byte in column 16 and row 4 may be used as an indication. Here, this byte is named<br>
as tributary slot MultiFrame Indicator (MFI-TS) of the OPUk TS. In the OPUk aTS-4 frame<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the MFI-TS byte increases by 1 for every frame until its number is the same as<br>
the number of the TSs in the OPUk (namely, its number is the same as the value of the PSI[1]<br>
byte), whereupon the counter is reset and the count starts over. For example, when the value of the<br>
MFI-TS byte indicates the first frame (the frame corresponding to 00 in FIG. 2), the 3 Cbyte's in<br>
this frame (a total of 6 bytes in rows 1-3 and columns 15-16) correspond to the first OPUk TSTS1;<br>
when the value of the MFI-TS byte indicates the second frame (the frame corresponding to 01 in<br>
FIG. 2), the 3 Cbyte's in this frame correspond to the second OPUk TSTS2, and so on.<br>
In the OPUk aTS-4 frame structure as shown in FIG. 2, because mod(3808/4) = 0, it is not<br>
necessary to stuff any column of the OPUk payload area. The MFI-TS circulates through 0-3. If<br>
MFI - TS = 0, the 3 Cbyte's of the current frame correspond to TS1; if MFI - TS = 3, the 3Cbyte's<br>
of the current frame correspond to TS4. If the OPUk payload area is divided into 11 OPUk TSs,<br>
fixed stuffing needs to be performed for the mod(3808/l 1) = 2 columns behind the OPUk payload<br>
area, and the structure of the 11 agnostic OPUk's (OPUk aTS-11) is as shown in FIG. 3. The<br>
MFI-TS circulates through 0-10. If MFI - TS = 0, the 3 Cbyte's of the current frame correspond to<br>
TS1; if MFI - TS = 10, the 3Cbyte's of the current frame correspond to TS11.<br>
The Cbyte is adapted to hold the number of bytes (Cn) of the client signals stuffed in the OPUk<br>
payload area.<br>
The PSI[2m] byte indicates the type of the client signal mapped in the mOPUk TS, and the<br>
PSI[2m+l] indicates the group of the mOPUk TS. For example, PSI[4] and PSI[5] indicate TS2,<br>
and PSI[6] and PSI[7] indicate TS3.<br>
Table 1 shows the relation between the PSI[2m] value and the type of the client signals mapped to<br>
the OPUk TS. Obviously, the relation between the value of the PSI[2m] and the type of the client<br>
signals may be set flexibly according to the service requirements, and such setting does not affect<br>
the essence of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
If each OPUk TS transmits independent client signals respectively, each OPUk TS corresponds to<br>
a different PSI [2m+1] value, indicating that the OPUk TS is in a different group. If some OPUk<br>
TSs are bundled into a greater transmission channel for transmitting client signals, the same value<br>
is configured for the PSI [2m+l] byte of the bundled OPUk TS, indicating that such OPUk TSs are<br>
in the same group.<br>
Table 2 shows an OPU4 which includes 11 unbundled OPUk TSs (OPUk aTS-11), and Table 2<br>
shows an OPU4 which includes 11 OPUk TSs, of which the 4th - 7th OPUk TSs are bundled for<br>
transmitting ODU3 signals. The PSI[8], PSI[10], PSI[12], and PSI[14] are of the same value "33",<br>
indicating that the type of the client signals is ODU3. The PSI[7], PSI[9], PSI[11], and PSI[13] are<br>
of the same value "4", indicating that the corresponding 4th-7th OPUk TSs belong to the same<br><br><br><br><br>
Described above is a method for dividing an OPUk into multiple OPUk TSs. The OPUk aTS-n<br>
frame structure constructed according to the method introduced above is suitable for most types of<br>
client signals, especially, the signals of the Ethernet, FC, and ESCON services. Table 5 is a list of<br>
mapping relations between most services and the OPUk aTS-n rate. The OPUk TS mapping<br>
relations listed in Table 5 are relatively reasonable, and accomplish a high line utilization ratio.<br>
Such an OPUk aTS-n frame structure supports grouping of 2-127 OPUk TSs. Table 5 takes<br>
OPU1-OPU4 as an example.<br>
Table 5<br><br><br><br>
It should be noted that, in Table 5, the OPUk TS rate unit is Gbps, the OPUk TS rate is accurate to<br>
five decimal places, and the OPU4 rate in this embodiment is supposed to be 121.48106 Gbps.<br>
100GE-4L: 4×25G 100GE channel;<br>
100GE-5L: 5×20G 100GE channel; and<br>
100GE-10L: 10×10G 100GE channel.<br>
The foregoing embodiment describes the OPUk aTS-n and the grouping of the OPUk TSs. With<br>
respect to the specific implementation approaches, the foregoing embodiment has many variations.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, if the PSI[0] value is 13, it indicates use of the OPUk aTS-n frame<br>
structure. In practice, however, the PSI[0] value is not necessarily 13. Those skilled in the art may<br>
use a value available in the prior art as the PSI[0] value for indicating use of the OPUk aTS-n<br>
frame structure.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the value in the PSI[1] position is used to identify the number of<br>
grouped OPUk TSs. However, those skilled in the art may use another reserved field in the prior<br>
art to identify the number of grouped OPUk TSs.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the PSI[2m] identifies the type of the client signals, and the<br>
PSI[2m+l] identifies the OPUk TS group mapped in the same OPUk TS. However, those skilled<br>
in the art may use another reserved field in the prior art to identify the type of the client signals and<br>
the OPUk TS group, and may define the mapping relation between the field value and the type of<br>
the client signals, and/or the value of each field, and the method of identifying the OPUk TS group<br>
as required. Such variations do not affect the implementation of the present invention.<br>
The OPUk aTS-n frame structure is introduced above, and the following describes how to map the<br>
client signal to the frame of this structure, and transmit the client signal.<br>
Before the client signal is mapped to the OPUk aTS-n frame structure, it is necessary to define the<br>
corresponding nOPUk TS agnostic to the k(ODTUan-k) frame structure according to the OPUk<br>
aTS-n frame structure, and the rate of the ODTUan-k frame structure is the same as the rate of the<br>
OPUk.<br>
If the number of OPUk TSs in an OPUk is n, the ODTUan-k frame unit is a structure composed of<br>
4n rows and int(3808/n) columns. Moreover, 3 Cbyte spaces exist at the head of the structure, and<br>
each Cbyte space occupies 2 bytes, as shown in FIG. 4. Therefore, a Cbyte space that occupies two<br>
bytes can indicate a total of 65535 bytes, and an ODTUan-k unit has a total of 4n × int(3808/n) ≤<br>
15232 bytes. Therefore, the Cbyte space that occupies two bytes is fully capable of indicating the<br>
payload bytes of the ODTUan-k frame.<br>
As described above, this embodiment may bundle some OPUk TSs in the OPUk aTS-n frame<br>
structure to form a greater transmission channel for transmitting client signals of higher rates, thus<br><br>
fulfilling the requirements of transmitting different service types to the utmost. FIG. 5 shows how<br>
to bundle 4 of 11 OPUk TSs into 4×ODTUa11 -k when the number of OPUk TSs of an OPUk is 11.<br>
When k = 4, the PSI value is supposed to be the value in Table 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the 4×ODTUa11-4 frame structure composed of 4 OPUk TSs has 3 Cbyte<br>
spaces, and each Cbyte space has 8 bytes, which are sufficient for indicating 1384×44 bytes.<br>
The following embodiment describes how to map multiple client signals to the OTN frame<br>
provided herein transparently at a full rate through the agnostic CBR mapping method specified in<br>
the ITU-T SG15 G709 living list.<br>
It is assumed that the OPU4 is divided into 11 OPUk TSs. The first 10 OPUk TSs are used to<br>
transmit 10GE LAN signals, and the 11th OPUk TS is used to transmit ODU2 signals. In this case,<br>
this embodiment inherits the OPUk aTS-n structure in the foregoing embodiment, and therefore,<br>
PSI[0]=13, and PSI[1]=11; and the byte allocation of the PSI[2m] and the PSI[2m+1] is shown in<br>
Table 6.<br><br>
For the transmitter of the client signal, the implementation process is as follows:<br>
The transmitter receives ten 10GE LAN signals and one ODU2 signal respectively, extracts the<br>
clocks of the signals, and compares the clocks with the local clocks to determine the Cn value of<br>
the signals. The transmitter maps the Cn value of each signal to the Cbyte space of the current<br>
ODTUa11-4 frame.<br><br>
At the frame next to the current ODTUa11-4 frame, according to the Cn value in the Cbyte space<br>
of the previous ODTUa11-4 frame, the transmitter maps the Cn bytes of each signal to the payload<br>
area of each ODTUa11 -4 frame structure respectively based on the Σ-∆ algorithm rule put forward<br>
in the agnostic CBR mapping method in the ITU-T SG15 G709 living list. As shown in FIG 6, if<br>
one ODU2 signal needs to be mapped to the ODTUa11-4 frame, at the (n-1)th ODTUa11-4 frame,<br>
the transmitter maps the Cn value determined in the received ODU2 signal to the Cbyte space; at<br>
the nth ODTUa11-4 frame, the transmitter maps the ODU2 signal of Cn bytes to the payload area<br>
of the ODTUa11-4 frame (346×44) according to the Cn value of the Cbyte space of the previous<br>
frame.<br>
The byte rate of the ODTUa11-4 frame structure is the same as the byte rate of the OPU4 frame,<br>
and the client signal clock is asynchronous to the clock of the ODTUa11-4 frame. The Cn value is<br>
adjusted to compensate for the deviation between the asynchronous clocks.<br>
The transmitter constructs an OPU4 aTS-11 frame structure, and maps each byte of the<br>
ODTUa11-4 frame structure (which is already mapped to the client signal) to each byte of the<br>
OPUk TS corresponding to the OPU4 aTS-11 frame structure.<br>
In this embodiment, an OPU4 frame divided into 11 OPUk TSs can carry 11 ODTUa11-4 frame<br>
structures, of which 10 ODTUa11-4 frames are mapped to 10GE LAN client signals and one<br>
ODTUa11-4 frame is mapped to the ODU2 signal.<br>
The transmitter adds the overhead such as PSI byte and MF1-TS byte into the OPU4 aTS-11 frame<br>
to form an OTU4 line frame, which is sent to the OTN.<br>
A method for receiving client signals in an OTN is provided in an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The method includes:<br>
receiving an OPUk, identifying an agnostic CBR mapping mode of an OPUk TS<br>
according to an overhead in the OPUk, and resolving the OPUk to obtain the OPUk TS; and<br>
resolving the OPUk TS of the OPUk in the agnostic CBR mapping mode to obtain the<br>
client signals.<br>
The method for resolving the OPUk TS of the OPUk in the agnostic CBR mapping mode to obtain<br>
the client signals includes:<br>
resolving the overhead of the OPUk TS of the OPUk to obtain the number of bytes (Cn)<br>
of the corresponding client signal, and resolving the clock information of the corresponding client<br>
signal according to the number of bytes (Cn) of the client signal; and<br>
demapping the client signals in the OPUk TS of the OPUk according to the number of<br>
bytes (Cn) and the clock information of the client signals, and recovering the client signals.<br><br>
For the receiver, that the OTU4 line frame is received from the transmitter, the implementation<br>
process is as follows:<br>
The receiver identifies the agnostic mapping mode of multiple OPUk TSs according to the PSI[0]<br>
byte in the OPU4, identifies the OPU4 aTS-11 frame according to the PSI[1] byte, identifies the<br>
mapped type of the client signals according to the value of the PSI[2m], identifies the unbundled<br>
OPUk TS according to the value of the PSI[2m+l], resolves the OPU4 aTS-11 into ODTUa11-4<br>
frames according to the multi-frame number of the MFI-TS, resolves the ODTUa11-4 frame into<br>
the Cn value of each client signal, recovers the clock of 11 client signals according to the Cn value,<br>
and recovers data flows of ten 10GE LAN signals and one ODU2 signal.<br>
If the OPUk TS is bundled in this embodiment, the bundled OPUk TS corresponds to the<br>
4×ODTUa11-4 structure as shown in FIG. 5. Therefore, on the occasion of mapping the<br>
4×ODTUa11-4 frame structure byte to the 4 bundled OPUk TSs of the OPU4 aTS-11, the Cbyte<br>
space is split into 12 Cbyte spaces as indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 5 or based on other rules.<br>
In this way, the payload area is split into 4 parts, which are mapped to the 4 bundled OPUk TSs of<br>
the OPU4 aTS-11 respectively.<br>
Those skilled in the art are aware that all or part of the steps of the foregoing embodiments may be<br>
implemented by hardware instructed by a program. The program may be stored in a<br>
computer-readable storage medium. The storage medium may be a Read-Only Memory<br>
(ROM)/Random Access Memory (RAM), magnetic disk, or Compact Disk (CD). When being<br>
executed, the program performs the following steps:<br>
obtaining the client signals, and presetting the OPUk TS in the OPUk according to the<br>
client signals;<br>
mapping the client signals onto the preset OPUk TS of the OPUk in an agnostic CBR<br>
mapping mode; and<br>
adding an overhead into the OPUk, and sending the OPUk to the OTN.<br>
Optionally, a further step is:<br>
stuffing the corresponding fixed byte positions in each row of the OPUk payload area<br>
with invalid data so that the number of non-stuffed bytes in each row of the OPUk payload area is<br>
an integer multiple of the number (n) of the OPUk TSs.<br>
Optionally, a further step is:<br>
grouping the OPUk TSs in an OPUk, where the OPUk TSs in the same group make up a<br>
channel for transmitting client signals;<br>
using the OPUk overhead byte to identify the grouping state; and<br>
mapping a part of the client signals to the OPUk TSs of some OPUk's in the agnostic<br><br>
CBR mapping mode, and mapping the remaining client signals to the OPUk TSs of the remaining<br>
OPUk's in a GFP mapping mode or an ATM cell mapping mode.<br>
Preferably, when being executed, the program may further perform this step:<br>
adding a control identifier into the overhead for at least one of the following purposes:<br>
identifying the OPUk TS corresponding to each client signal, identifying the number of OPUk TSs<br>
in the OPUk, identifying the type of the client signals mapped in the OPUk TS.<br>
Preferably, the method further includes:<br>
using a control identifier added into the overhead to identify the mapping from the client<br>
signal to the OPUk TS.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, a device for transmitting client signals in an OTN in the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes:<br>
a client signal obtaining unit 71, adapted to obtain client signals, and make statistics of the<br>
number of bytes of each client signal obtained by each OPUk TS within a frame;<br>
a mapping unit 72, adapted to: map the number of bytes at the overhead byte of the OPUk,<br>
and map the client signals to the OPUk TS corresponding to the number of bytes according to the<br>

the client signals, and add a control identifier into the OPUk overhead byte for at least one of the<br>
following purposes: identifying the OPUk TSs that are preset in the OPUk payload area and<br>
correspond to the number of bytes, identifying the number (n) of OPUk TSs of the OPUk payload<br>
area, and identifying the type of the client signals mapped in the OPUk TS; and further adapted to<br>
add an OPUk TS group identifier in the overhead byte of the OPUk for indicating the group that<br>
includes the OPUk TS; and<br>
a sending unit 74, adapted to send an ODUk that includes the OPUk.<br>
The mapping unit 72 may map some client signals to the OPUk TSs of some OPUk's in an<br>
agnostic CBR mapping mode, and map the remaining client signals to the OPUk TSs of the<br>
remaining OPUk's in a GFP mapping mode or ATM cell mapping mode.<br>
If the mapping unit 72 employs the agnostic CBR mapping mode, the mapping unit 72 needs to:<br>
map the number of bytes of a client signal received within a frame to the OPUk TS<br>
overhead of the OPUk;<br>
map each byte of this client signal to the payload area of the current OPUk TS frame<br>
according to the number of bytes of a client signal mapped in the overhead byte of the previous<br>
OPUk TS;<br>
map each byte in the payload area of the OPUk TS frame to each byte of the OPUk TS<br><br>
corresponding to this client signal in the OPUk respectively; and<br>
map the number of bytes of the client signal in the OPUk TS overhead byte to the OPUk<br>
overhead byte.<br>
The structure in the foregoing embodiment may further include a grouping unit and a stuffing unit.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a device for transmitting client signals in an OTN in the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The client signal obtaining unit 81, mapping unit 82, OPUk constructing unit 83,<br>
and sending unit 84 are the same as those in the foregoing embodiment.<br>
The grouping unit 85 is adapted to determine the number (n) of OPUk TSs in the OPUk payload<br>

OPUk payload area with invalid data according to the number (n) of the OPUk TS determined by<br>
the grouping unit so that the number of non-stuffed bytes in each row of the OPUk payload area is<br>
an integer multiple of the number (n) of the OPUk TSs.<br>
A device for transmitting client signals in an OTN is provided in an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 9, the device includes:<br>
a client signal obtaining unit 91, adapted to obtain the client signals;<br>

signals;<br>

OPUk in an agnostic CBR mapping mode;<br>

Preferably, the presetting unit 92 includes:<br>

OPUk TSs of the OPUk according to the type of the client signal and the bit rate of the OPUk; and<br>

number of OPUk TSs, where the OPUk TSs occupy the OPUk bytes by using the number of OPUk<br>
TSs as a cycle.<br>
Preferably, the presetting unit 92 includes at least one of the following units:<br>

data so that the number of non-stuffed bytes of the OPUk is an integer multiple of the number of<br>

a grouping unit 924, adapted to: group the preset OPUk TSs of the OPUk, and let the<br><br>
OPUk TSs in the same group constitute a channel for transmitting client signals, where the<br>
grouping state may be identified by an overhead identifier in the OPUk.<br>
Preferably, the mapping unit 93 may include:<br>
a unit 931 for determining the number of bytes of a client signal, adapted to determine the<br>
number of bytes (Cn) of the first client signal according to the rate of the first client signal among<br>
the client signals and the OPUk TS rate corresponding to the first client signal;<br>
a unit 932 for mapping number of bytes, adapted to map the number of bytes (Cn) of the<br>
first client signal to the overhead of the OPUk TS corresponding to the first client signal; and<br>

in the OPUk TS, and identifying the mode of mapping the client signal to the OPUk TS.<br>
The functions of the units in the device for transmitting client signals in an OTN in this<br>
embodiment are the same as those in the foregoing embodiment, and are not repeated here any<br>
further.<br>
A device for receiving client signals in an OTN is provided in an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 10, the device includes:<br>
a receiving unit 101, adapted to receive an OPUk;<br>
a first resolving unit 102, adapted to: identify an agnostic CBR mapping mode of an<br>
OPUk TS according to an overhead in the OPUk, and resolve the OPUk to obtain the OPUk TS;<br>
for example, extract the number of OPUk TSs indicated in the OPUk overhead byte,<br>
construct an ODTUan-k frame structure composed of 4nxint(3808/n) bytes, and resolve out the<br>
ODTUan-k, where n is the number of OPUk TSs; and<br>
a second resolving unit 103, adapted to resolve the OPUk TS of the OPUk in the agnostic<br>
CBR mapping mode to obtain the client signals.<br>
Specifically, if the client signal is mapped to the OPUk frame in an agnostic CBR mapping mode,<br><br>
the functions of the units of the device for receiving client signals in an OTN are as follows:<br>
The sending unit 101 is adapted to receive an OPUk, which may be included in an ODUk.<br>
The first resolving unit 102 is adapted to resolve out an ODTUan-k, and more specifically, extract<br>
the number of OPUk TSs (n) indicated in the OPUk overhead byte, construct an ODTUan-k frame<br>
structure composed of 4n×int(3808/n) bytes, and resolve out an ODTUan-k according to the<br>
mapping relation between the number of bytes of the client signal indicated in the overhead byte of<br>
the OPUk and the OPUk TS. In the case that the OPUk TSs are bundled, the first resolving unit<br>
extracts the number of OPUk TSs (n) indicated in the OPUk overhead byte, and constructs an<br>
ODTUan-k frame structure composed of 4nxint(3808/n)x bytes in light of the OPUk TS group<br>
identifier indicated in the OPUk overhead byte, where x represents the number of OPUk TSs with<br>
the same group identifier.<br>
Preferably, the second resolving unit 103 includes:<br>
a unit for resolving the number of bytes of a client signal, adapted to: resolve the<br>
overhead of the OPUk TS of the OPUk to obtain the number of bytes (Cn) of the corresponding<br>
client signal, and resolve out the clock information of the corresponding client signal according to<br>
the number of bytes (Cn) of the client signal; and<br>
a client signal resolving unit, adapted to demap the client signals in the OPUk TS of the<br>
OPUk according to the number of bytes (Cn) and the clock information of the client signals, and<br>
recover the client signals.<br>
That is, the second resolving unit 103 recovers the client signal clock according to the number of<br>
the bytes of the client signal in the ODTUan-k overhead, and recovers the client signal data flow<br>
according to the client signals mapped in the ODTUan-k payload area and the type of the client<br>
signals indicated in the OPUk overhead byte.<br>
In this embodiment, the OPUk TSs are grouped and allocated according to the rate of different<br>
client signals on the basis of the OPUk frame structure to improve efficiency and flexibility of<br>
transmitting various client signals, and the agnostic CBR mapping mode in the ITU-T SG15 G709<br>
living list is applied to implement transparent agnostic CBR transmission for various client signals<br>
of different rates. Therefore, it is not necessary to define a fixed mapping mode for each client<br>
signal of a different rate. The embodiments of the present invention enables effective access of<br>
various existing client signals, and are highly agnostic to the client signals of new rates that will<br>
come forth in the future, make the OTN standard system more agnostic to the client signals, make<br>
the OTN device more flexibly agnostic to the accessing client signals, and improve the bandwidth<br>
utilization ratio of the line.<br>
For the OPUk TS-n structure, each OPUk TS can use an agnostic CBR mapping method, or use a<br><br>
GFP or ATM cell mapping method already defined in the G.709, or combination thereof. In this<br>
case, the PSI[2m] may be further defined so that it indicates both the service type and the mapping<br>
mode, as shown in Table 7.<br><br><br><br>
When an OPUk TS employs a GFP or ATM cell mapping mode, because such modes insert idle<br>
frames to compensate for the rate deviation, the Cbyte corresponding to the OPUk TS does not<br>
need to be put into use, and may be stuffed as a reserved byte. The definition of other bytes of the<br>
frame structure may remain unchanged. FIG. 11 shows a structure of an ODTUn-k frame that<br>
employs a GFP or ATM cell mapping mode. The position that previously holds a Cbyte now holds<br>
a fix stuff byte.<br>
On the occasion of mapping a data packet to an ODTUn-k in a GFP mode, the data packet is<br>
encapsulated into a GFP frame based on the G7041, and then each byte of the GFP frame is put<br>
into an ODTUn-k structure. The clock deviation between the GFP frame and the ODTUn-k is<br>
corrected through idle frames.<br>
The ATM cell mapping method is similar to the GFP frame mapping method except no need of<br>
encapsulating the ATM cell into a GFP frame.<br>
The method of mapping from an ODTUn-k to an OPUk in a GFP or ATM mapping mode is the<br>
same as the method of mapping from an ODTUan-k to an OPUk in agnostic CBR mapping mode.<br>
In this way, the position that previously holds the Cbyte corresponding to the OPUk TS based on a<br>
GFP or ATM mapping method now holds a fix stuff byte. In the 11 OPUk TSs shown in FIG. 12,<br>
the TS2 employs a GFP mapping mode, and other TSs employ an agnostic CBR mapping mode.<br>
Elaborated above are a method and devices for transmitting client signals in an OTN in an<br>

number of non-stuffed bytes of the OPUk is an integer multiple of the number of the OPUk TSs;<br>
and<br>
a grouping unit, adapted to: group the determined OPUk TSs of the OPUk, and let the OPUk<br>
TSs in a same group constitute a channel for transmitting the client signals.<br>
14.	The device of claim 11, wherein the mapping unit comprises:<br>
a unit for determining the number of bytes of a client signal, adapted to determine the number<br>
of bytes of a first client signal according to a rate of the first client signal among the client signals<br>
and an OPUk TS rate corresponding to the first client signal;<br>
a unit for mapping the number of bytes, adapted to map the number of the bytes of the first<br>
client signal to an overhead of the OPUk TS corresponding to the first client signal; and<br>
a unit for mapping bytes of a client signal, adapted to map the client signal of the number of<br>
the bytes to the OPUk TS corresponding to the first client signal.<br>
15.	The device of claim 11, wherein the mapping unit comprises a hybrid mapping unit,<br>
adapted to:<br>
map a first client signal among the client signals to the OPUk TS corresponding to the first<br>
client signal in the agnostic CBR mapping mode; and<br>
map a second client signal among the client signals to the OPUk TS corresponding to the<br>
second client signal in a Generic Framing Procedure, GFP, mapping mode or an Asynchronous<br>
Transfer Mode, ATM, cell mapping mode.<br>
16.	The device of claim 11, further comprising:<br>
an OPUk constructing unit, adapted to: add a control identifier into the overhead added in the<br>
OPUk for at least one of the following purposes: identifying the OPUk TS corresponding to each<br>
client signal, identifying the number of OPUk TSs in the OPUk, identifying a type of the client<br><br>
signals mapped in the OPUk TS, and identifying a mode of mapping the client signal to the OPUk<br>
TS.<br>
17.	A device for receiving client signals in an Optical Transport Network, OTN, comprising:<br>
a receiving unit, adapted to receive an Optical Channel Payload Unit-k, OPUk;<br>
a first resolving unit, adapted to: identify an agnostic Constant Bit Rate, CBR, mapping mode<br>
of an Optical Channel Payload Unit-k Tributary Slot, OPUk TS, according to an overhead in the<br>
OPUk, and resolve the OPUk to obtain the OPUk TS; and<br>
a second resolving unit, adapted to resolve the OPUk TS of the OPUk in the agnostic CBR<br>
mapping mode to obtain the client signals.<br>
18.	The device of claim 17, wherein the second resolving unit comprises:<br>
a unit for resolving the number of bytes of a client signal, adapted to: resolve the overhead to<br>
obtain the number of bytes of corresponding client signals, and resolve out clock information of<br>
the corresponding client signals according to the number of the bytes; and<br>
a client signal resolving unit, adapted to demap the client signals in the OPUk TS of the<br>
OPUk according to the resolved number of the bytes and the clock information of the client signals,<br>
and recover the client signals.<br><br><br>
A method for transmitting client signals in an OTN includes: obtaining the client signals, and<br>
determining an OPUk TS in an OPUk according to the client signals; mapping the client signals to<br>
the OPUk TS in an agnostic CBR mapping mode; and adding an overhead into the OPUk, and<br>
sending the OPUk with the added overhead to the OTN. A device for transmitting client signals<br>
and a device for receiving client signals in an OTN are disclosed.</td>
