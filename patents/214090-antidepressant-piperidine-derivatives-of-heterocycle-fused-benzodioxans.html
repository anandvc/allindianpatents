ross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application Serial No. 60/410,033,<br>
filed September 12, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Major depression is a serious health problem affecting more than 5% of the<br>
population, with a life-time prevalence of 15-20%.<br>
[0003] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have produced success in treating<br>
depression and related illnesses and have become among the most prescribed<br>
drugs. They nonetheless have a slow onset of action, often taking several weeks to<br>
produce their full therapeutic effect. Furthermore, they are effective in less than two-<br>
thirds of patients.<br>
[0004] Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are well known for the<br>
treatment of depression and other conditions. SSRIs work by blocking the neuronal<br>
reuptake of serotonin, thereby increasing the concentration of serotonin in the<br>
synaptic space, and thus increasing the activation of postsynaptic serotonin<br>
receptors.<br>
[0005] However, although a single dose of an SSRI can inhibit the neuronal<br>
serotonin transporter which would be expected.to increase synapite serotonin long-<br>
term treatment is required before clinical improvement is achieved.<br>
[0006] It has been suggested that the SSRIs increase the serotonin levels in the<br>
vicinity of the serotonergic cell bodies and that the excess serotonin activates<br>
somatodendritic autoreceptors, 5HT1A receptors, causing a decrease in serotonin<br>
release in major forebrain areas. This negative feedback limits the increment of<br>
synaptic serotonin that can be induced by antidepressants.<br>
[0007] A 5HT1A antagonist would limit the negative feedback and should improve<br>
the efficacy of the serotonin reuptake mechanism (Perez, V., et al., The Lancet,<br>
349:1594-1597 (1997)). Such a combination therapy would be expected to speed up<br>
the effect of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor.<br>
[0008] Thus, it is highly desirable to provide improved compounds which boft<br>
inhibit serotonin reuptake and which are antagonists of the 5HT1A receptor.<br>

[0031] Compounds of the present invention are prepared in accordance with the<br>
following general description and specific examples. Variables used are as defined<br>
for Formula I, unless otherwise noted. Specifically (Scheme 1), the appropriately<br>
substituted piperidine (2) is combined with a suitably substituted benzodioxan<br>
methyltosylate or bromide (1) in a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide and heated to a<br>
temperature of 70-100°C for several hours as illustrated below. Alternatively, the<br>
appropriately substituted piperidine may be acylated with a suitably substituted<br>
benzodioxan carboxylic acid chloride, and the resulting amide reduced to the amine<br>
with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride or borane/THF. The<br>
piperidine may also be combined with a suitably substituted benzodioxan<br>
carboxaldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride.<br>
[0032] Alternatively (Scheme 2), an appropriately substituted pyridine (3) may be<br>
alkylated with a suitably substituted benzodioxan methyltosylate or bromide (1) by<br>
heating the mixture in a high-boiling polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide to<br>
produce the pyridinium ion (4). The pyridinium ion may be reduced to the<br>
tetrahydropyridine by treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as sodium<br>
borohydride in ethanol or directly to the piperidine by treatment with hydrogen over a<br>
suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon.<br>
[0033] The benzodioxan methyltosylates and halides (1) are known compounds or<br>
they may be prepared from the appropriately substituted salicylaldehydes by the<br>
method (a) described in Scheme 3 below. The salicylaldehyde (5) is alkylated with<br>
an epihalohydrin or glycidyl arylsulfonate in the presence of a suitable base. The<br>
aldehyde moiety is then converted to a phenol by a Baeyer-Villager procedure and<br>
cyclization to the benzodioxan methanol (7) effected by treatment with a base such<br>
as potassium carbonate. The alcohol is elaborated to a tosylate (1) by treatment with<br>
p-toluensulyfonyl chloride and a tertiary amine base or to a bromide by treatment<br>
Alternatively (b), the substituted salicylaldehyde (8) may be protected with a suitable<br>
protecting group such as benzyl and the aldehyde (9) converted to a phenol (10) as<br>
described above. Following elaboration of the phenol of the glycidyl ether (11) by<br>
treatment with an epihalohydrin or glycidyl arylsulfonate, deprotection and cyclization<br>
are effected in a single step via a transfer hydrogenation in the presence of sodium<br>
bicarbonate. The bromide or tosylate is prepared as described above. Or the<br>
benzodioxan methylbromide may be prepared from a suitably substituted guaiacol<br>
(12) by procedure (c) shown above. The guiacol is alkylated with a glycidyl<br>
arylsulfonate or an epihalohydrin as described above. The methyl ether (13) is then<br>
cleaved by treatment with 48% HBr; this also converts the epoxide to a bromohydrin<br>
(14). Cyclization directly to the benzodioxan methylbromide (1) is effected by the<br>
Mitsonobu procedure.<br>
[0034] The 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinolin-2-ylmethylamines of the invention<br>
in which R4 is H are alternatively prepared as illustrated in Scheme 4 below.<br>
Specifically, the appropriately substituted nitroguaiacol (15) is alkylated with allyl<br>
bromide in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride and then<br>
demethylated by a reagent such as sodium hydroxide. The resulting 4-nitro-2-<br>
allyloxyphenol (17) is then alkylated with glycidyl tosylate or an epihalohydrin in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydride and heated in a high boiling solvent such<br>
as mesitylene or xylene to effect both rearrangement of the allyl group and<br>
cyclization of the dioxan ring. The resulting primary alcohol (19) is converted to the<br>
tosylate by reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine<br>
or pyridine, or alternatively to a halide by reaction with carbon tetrabromide or carbon<br>
tetrachloride in combination with triphenylphosphine. The allyl side chain is then<br>
isomerized by treatment with catalytic bis-acetonitrile palladium (II) chloride in<br>
refluxing methylene chloride or benzene. Allylic oxidation of 20 with selenium dioxide<br>
in refluxing dioxane/water gives the o-nitrocinnamaldehyde, which upon reduction<br>
with iron in acetic acid cyclizes to the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinoline-2-<br>
methyltosylate (21) or halide. Replacement of the tosylate or halide with the<br>
appropriately substituted piperidine in some high boiling solvent such as dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0035] The 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinolin-2-ylmethylamines of the invention<br>
in which R4 is alkyl may be prepared from the nitro olefin described above in the<br>
following manner (Scheme 5). The rearranged olefin (20) is treated sequentially with<br>
ozone and a tertiary amine or with osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate to give the<br>
o-nitrobenzaldehyde (22). Condensation with the appropriate<br>
triphenylphosphorylidene ketone under Wittig conditions gives the o-nitrocinnamyl<br>
ketone (23), which upon reduction by iron in acetic acid, cyclizes to the<br>
corresponding 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinoline-2-methyltosylate (24).<br>
Replacement of the tosylate with the appropriately substituted piperidine as above<br>
gives the title compounds of the invention. Substitution of trimethyl<br>
phosphonoacetate for the triphenylphosphorylidene ketone in the Wittig procedure<br>
above, followed by reduction of the nitro group with tin (II) chloride and cyclization in<br>
acid gives the compounds of the invention in which R4 is hydroxy. Treatment of the<br>
hydroxy derivative with an inorganic acid chloride such as phosphoryl chloride or<br>
bromide gives the compounds of the invention in which R4 is halo. Substitution of<br>
diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate for the triphenylphosphorylidene ketone in the<br>
Wittig procedure above, followed by reduction of the nitro group with tin (II) chloride<br>
and cyclization in acid gives the compounds of the invention in which R4 is amino.<br>
[0036] Compounds of the invention in which R1 is attached to position 6 of the 2,3-<br>
dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinolin-2-ylmethylamines may be alternatively prepared by<br>
a variation of the Skraup quinoline synthesis according to Scheme 6 below. The<br>
appropriately substituted benzodioxan methyltosylate (25) is nitrated under standard<br>
conditions with nitric acid in a solvent such as dichloroethane and the resulting nitro<br>
compound (26) reduced by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst<br>
such as platinum on sulfide carbon. Treatment of the resulting aniline (27) with<br>
acrolein in the presence of hydrogen chloride and an oxidant such as p-chloranil or<br>
naphthoquinone gives the corresponding 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinoline (28).<br>
Replacement of the tosylate with the appropriately substituted piperidine as above<br>
gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0037] The 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinazolin-2-ylmethylamines of the<br>
invention are prepared as illustrated below (Scheme 7). The o-nitrobenzaldehyde<br>
(22) described above is converted to the oxime (29) by treatment with hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium acetate and the<br>
nitro group reduced to the amine by hydrogenation over palladium on carbon.<br>
Cyclization to the quinazoline N-oxide is effected by treatment at reflux with the<br>
appropriate ortho ester according to the method of Ostrowski (Heterocycles, vol. 43,<br>
No. 2, p. 389, 1996). The quinazoline N-oxide may be reduced to the quinazoline<br>
(30) by a suitable reducing agent such as hydrogen over Raney-nickel. Alternatively,<br>
an extended period of reflux in the ortho ester gives the reduced quinazoline directly<br>
via a disproportionation reaction and the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinazoline-2-<br>
methyltosylate or halide may be isolated by column chromatography. Replacement<br>
of the tosylate or halide with the appropriately substituted piperidine in some high<br>
boiling solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0038] The 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinazolin-2-ylnnethylamines of the<br>
invention may be alternatively prepared from the rearranged olefin described above<br>
by the method outlined in Scheme 8 below. The nitro olefin (20) is first reduced to<br>
the aniline by treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as stannous chloride<br>
dihydrate in refuxing ethyl acetate and the resulting amine acylated with the<br>
appropriate acyl halide or anhydride. The olefin (31) is then converted to the<br>
aldehyde (32) by cleavage with catalytic osmium tetroxide in the presence of excess<br>
sodium periodate. Cyclization directly to the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-<br>
f]quinazoline-2-methyltosylate (30) or halide is effected by treatment of the amido<br>
aldehyde (32) with ammonia and replacement of the tosylate or halide with the<br>
appropriately substituted piperidine in some high boiling solvent such as dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide as described above gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0039] The 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-f]quinoxalin-2-ylmethylamines of the<br>
invention are prepared as illustrated in Scheme 9 below. The o-nitrobenzaldehyde<br>
(22) described above is oxidized to the o-nitrobenzoic acid (33) by a suitable oxidant<br>
such as chromium trioxide (Jones" oxidation) or sodium chlorite and the acid<br>
converted to the o-nitroaniline (34) with diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) in the<br>
presence of a tertiary base such as diisopropylethylamine. Reduction of the resulting<br>
nitroaniline to the diamine (35) with hydrogen and palladium on carbon and<br>
cyclization by treatment with the appropriate dicarbonyl compound (for example,<br>
glyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 3,4-hexanedione) gives the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-<br>
f]quinoxaline-2-methyltosylate (36) or halide. Replacement of the tosylate or halide<br>
with the appropriately substituted piperidine in some high boiling solvent such as<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0040] The o-nitrobenzaldehyde (22) used in the chemistry described above may<br>
be alternatively prepared as shown in scheme 10 below. The appropriate mono-<br>
allylated catechol (37) is elaborated with glycidyl tosylate as described above and<br>
rearranged in refluxing mesitylene. Cyclization to the benzodioxan methanol (39) is<br>
effected by treatment with sodium bicarbonate in ethanol and the alcohol is<br>
converted to the tosylate (40) or halide as described above. After rearrangement of<br>
the double bond by treatment with catalytic bis-acetonitrile palladium (II) chloride in<br>
refluxing methylene chloride and cleavage with ozone or osmium tetroxide/sodium<br>
periodate as described above, the resulting aldehyde (41) is regioselectively nitrated<br>
with a combination of nitric acid and tin (IV) chloride.<br>
[0041] The 7,8-dihydro[1,4]dioxino[2,3-g][1,3]benzoxazol-8-ylmethylamines of the<br>
invention are prepared as illustrated in Scheme 8 below. The amido olefin (31)<br>
described in Scheme 8 is cleaved to the corresponding o-amidobenzaldehyde (32)<br>
by treatment with catalytic osmium tetroxide in the presence of sodium periodate.<br>
The aldehyde is converted to the phenol (42) by treatment with meta-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a Baeyer-Villager reaction and cyclization to the 7,8-<br>
dihydro[1,4]dioxino[2,3-g][1,3]benzoxazo!e (43) is effected by treatment at reflux with<br>
an appropriate dehydrating agent such as an ortho ester or an acid catalyst such as<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid. Replacement of the tosylate or halide with the appropriately<br>
substituted piperidine in some high boiling solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide gives<br>
the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0042] Alternatively (Scheme 12), the nitro olefin (20) may be reduced with tin (II)<br>
chloride as described in Scheme 8 above and protected with a suitable protecting<br>
group such as carbobenzoxy (Cbz) before the olefin is cleaved to the aldehyde (45)<br>
by treatment with osmium tetroxide/sodium periodate and the aldehyde converted to<br>
a phenol (46) by the Baeyer-Villager procedure, Deprotection by treatment with<br>
hydrogen over palladium on carbon gives the o-aminophenol, (47) which is cyclized<br>
to the 7,8-dihydro[1,4]dioxino[2,3-g][1,3]benzoxazole (43) by treatment with the<br>
appropriate ortho ester, carboxylic acid or anhydride. Treatment of the o-<br>
aminophenol<br>
with cyanogen bromide or chloride or a suitably substituted carbamoyl chloride leads<br>
to compounds of the invention in which R4 is amino. Treatment of the o-aminophenol<br>
with carbonyl diimidazole gives the oxazolone that leads to compounds of the<br>
invention in which R4 is halo via treatment with an inorganic anhydride such as<br>
phosphoryl chloride or bromide. Replacement of the tosylate with the appropriately<br>
substituted piperidine as above gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0043] Compounds of the invention in which R1 is hydrogen and R4 is alkyl are<br>
most conveniently prepared according to scheme 13 below. The appropriate 2",3",4"-<br>
trihydroxyacylphenone (48) is regioselectively alkylated with glycidyl tosylate or an<br>
epihalohydrin in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate to give the<br>
corresponding 7-acyl-8-hydroxybenzodioxan-2-methanol (49). Following conversion<br>
of the ketone to the oxime (50) by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and<br>
sodium acetate, cyclization to the oxazole (51) is effected by treatment with<br>
phosphoryl chloride in the appropriate dimethylalkanoic acid amide. The resulting<br>
7,8-dihydro-1,6,9-rioxa-3-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene-8-methanol is converted to<br>
the tosylate (52) by treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine and<br>
combined with the appropriate piperidine as described above to give the title<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
[0044] The 7,8-dihydro-3H-6,9-dioxa-1,3-diaza-cyclopen[a]naphthalenes of the<br>
invention are prepared as illustrated in Scheme 14 below. The diamine 35 described<br>
in Scheme 9 is cyclized by treatment at reflux with the appropriate carboxylic acid to<br>
give the imidazole (53). Refluxing the diamine dihydrochloride in higher boilling<br>
carboxylic acids occasionally causes replacement of a tosylate group with a chloride.<br>
Replacement of the tosylate or halide with the appropriately substituted piperidine in<br>
some high boiling solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide gives the 7,8-dihydro-3H-6,9-<br>
dioxa-1,3-diaza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalenes of the invention in which R7 is hydrogen,<br>
perfluoroalkyl or alkyl. Treatment of the diamine described above with cyanogen<br>
bromide or chloride or a suitably substituted carbamoyl chloride leads to compounds<br>
of the invention in which R7 is amino. Treatment of the diamine with carbonyl<br>
diimidazole gives the imidazolone which leads to compounds of the invention in<br>
which R7 is halo via treatment with an inorganic anhydride such as phosphoryl<br>
chloride or bromide. Replacement of the tosylate with the appropriately substituted<br>
piperidine as above gives the title compounds of the invention.<br>
[0045] The 2,3-dihydro-7H-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-e]indoles of the invention are prepared<br>
as illustrated in Scheme 15 below. Specifically, the primary alcohol (19) from the<br>
Claisen rearrangement described in Scheme 4 is converted to the tosylate (54) by<br>
reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine or<br>
pyridine, or alternatively to a halide by reaction with carbon tetrabromide or carbon<br>
tetrachloride in combination with triphenylphosphine. The allyl side chain is then<br>
cleaved to the aldehyde (55) by treatment with orone at low temperature, followed by<br>
work-up with a tertiary base such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, or by<br>
treatment with catalytic osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate. Reduction of the<br>
nitro group with hydrogen over platinum oxide leads directly to formation of the indole<br>
(56) in which R8 is hydrogen. Alternatively, the aldehyde may be treated with an<br>
appropriate alkyl Grignard reagent or with trifluaromethyl trimethylsilane in the<br>
presence of cesium fluoride, then oxidized to a ketone with a suitable oxidant such as<br>
pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) or the Swern reagent and reduced with hydrogen<br>
over platinum oxide to give the indoles in which R8 is alkyl or trifluoromethyl.<br>
Replacement of the tosylate or halide with the appropriately substituted piperidine in<br>
some high boiling solvent such as dimethyl suboxide gives the title compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0046] The 2,3-dihydro-7H-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-e]indoles of the invention may<br>
alternatively be prepared from nitroaldehyde 21 by the following procedure (Scheme<br>
16). The o-nitrobenzaldehyde (22) is condensed with the appropriate nitroalkane in<br>
the presence of a suitable base catalyst to yield the corresponding o,b-dinitrostyrene<br>
(57). Reduction of both nitro groups with hydrogen over palladium on carbon is<br>
accompanied by cyclization to form the indole (58). Replacement of the tosylate with<br>
the appropriately substituted piperidine as above gives the title compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0047] The compounds of the invention may be resolved into their enantiomers by<br>
conventional methods or, preferably, the individual enantiomers may be prepared<br>
directly by substitution of (2R)-(-)-g!ycidyl 3-nitrobenzene-sulfonate or tosylate (for<br>
the S benzodioxan methanamine) or (2S)-(+)-g!ycidyl 3-nitrobenzene-sulfonate or<br>
tosylate (for the R enantiomer) in place of epihalohydrin or racemic glycidyl tosylate<br>
in the procedures above.<br>
[0048] In yet another method, the heterocycle-fused benzodioxans of the present<br>
invention may be prepared in accordance with Scheme 17. The synthesis of<br>
compound 1 is comprised of steps that begin with halogenation of 59 where R" is alkyl<br>
of 1 -6 carbon atoms, with reagents such as N-halosuccinimide in acetonitrile to give<br>
60 (where Hal is halogen such as Br, CI or I). Deprotecting 60 with Lewis acids such<br>
as boron tribromide, boron trichloride, aluminum trichloride, ferric chloride, or<br>
trimethylsilyl iodide in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, or with strong<br>
protic acids such as HBr and HCI gives the salt 61. Free base 61 may be obtained<br>
by neutralization with an Amberlyst A-21 resin slurry in polar solvents such as<br>
ethanol or methanol.<br>
[0049] Alkylation of 61, either as the free base or as the salt, with benzyl or<br>
substituted benzyl protected glycidyl ethers where R" is benzyl,<br>
substituted benzyl such as 4-bromobenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2- or 4-nitrobenzyl,<br>
or 4-methoxybenzyl) in suitable polar solvents such as DMSO, DMF, or DMA in the<br>
presence of bases such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, or triethyiamine<br>
gives 62. 62 was then cyclized using palladium catalysts such as<br>
tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, or<br>
palladium acetate with ligands from the group consisting of (±) BINAP and separate<br>
enantiomers thereof, (±) Tol-BINAP and separate enantiomers thereof; 1-1"-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene, 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and 1,2<br>
bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ethane in the presence of bases such as NaH, LiH, KH,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, titanium carbonate, cesium carbonate,<br>
potassium t-butoxide or potassium phosphate tribasic in suitable solvent such as<br>
toluene, or alternatively, with copper catalyst such as copper iodide in the presence<br>
of bases such NaH, LiH, KH in a suitable solvent such as toluene to afford 63.<br>
[0050] Deprotection of quinoline 63 with Lewis acids such as boron tribromide,<br>
boron trichloride, aluminum trichloride, ferric chloride, trimethylsilyl iodide in a<br>
suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, or with strong protic acids such as HBr<br>
and HCI or under reductive cleavage conditions using Pd catalyst and hydrogen<br>
transfer reagents such as hydrogen, cyclohexene, methyl cyclohexene, or<br>
ammonium formate gives the heterocycle-fused benzodioxanmethanol 64. The<br>
hydroxy! moiety of 64 can be activated with an aryl- or alkylsulfonyl chloride such as<br>
p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, 2-, 3- or 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl<br>
chloride, or 2- or 4-bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of bases such as<br>
triethylamine or pyridine in suitable solvents such as methylene chloride, THF, or<br>
toluene to afford 65 where R"" is a sulfonate such as p-toluenesulfonate,<br>
methanesulfonate, 2-, 3-, or 4-nitrobenzenesulfonate, or 2- or 4-<br>
bromobenzenesulfonate. The final coupling of 65 with piperidines appropriate to the<br>
invention, in the presence of bases such as Hunig"s base (diisopropylethylamine),<br>
potassium carbonate, or sodium carbonate in polar solvents such as THF, dioxane,<br>
DMSO, DMF, or DMA affords the compounds of the invention I.<br>
[0051] The phenols, guaiacols, catechols, 2",3",4"-trihydroxyacylphenones and<br>
benzodioxan methyltosylates appropriate to the above chemistry are known<br>
compounds or can be prepared by one schooled in the art. The appropriately<br>
substituted piperidines and tetrahydropyridines are known compounds or can readily<br>
be prepared by one schooled in the art, for example as illustrated in Scheme 18<br>
below for 4-(7-methoxybenzofuran-3-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The<br>
appropriately substituted benzofuranone (66) is converted to the triflate (67)<br>
by treatment with triflic anhydride and a tertiary base such as triethylamine.<br>
Conversion to the dioxaborolane (68) is effected by treatment with 4,4,5,5-<br>
tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in the presence of a tertiary base and a suitable<br>
palladium catalyst such as [1,1"-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II)<br>
chloride. The dioxaborolane (68) is coupled with the appropriately protected<br>
azahelerocyclic triflate under Suzuki conditions involving a palladium catalyst such as<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphospine)palladium(0) to give (69), which following deprotection<br>
affords the substituted tetrahydropyridine (70) suitable for production of certain of the<br>
compounds of the invention. Reduction of the double bond in 70 by hydrogenation<br>
over a catalyst such as palladium on carbon gives the substituted piperidine, which is<br>
needed for the production of still other compounds of the invention.<br>
[0052] The substituted pyridines appropriate to Scheme 2 are known compounds<br>
or may be readily prepared by one schooled in the art by the method illustrated for 4-<br>
benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl-pyridine in Scheme 19 below. The suitably substituted<br>
bromobenzothiophene or bromobenzofuran (71) may be coupled with pyridine-4-<br>
boronic acid under Suzuki conditions involving a palladium catalyst such as [1,1"-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]pa!ladium (II) chloride to give intermediates (72)<br>
useful for the production of the compounds of the invention.<br>
[0053] A protocol similar to that used by Cheetham et al. (Neuropharmacol. 32:737,<br>
1993) was used to determine the affinity of the compounds of the invention for the<br>
serotonin transporter. The compound"s ability to displace 3H-paroxetine from male<br>
rat frontal cortical membranes was determined using a Tom Tech filtration device to<br>
separate bound from free 3H-paroxetine and a Wallac 1205 Beta Plate® counter to<br>
quantitate bound radioactivity. Kij"s thus determined for standard clinical<br>
antidepressants are 1.96 nM for fluoxetine, 14.2 nM for imipramine and 67.6 nM for<br>
zimelidine. A strong correlation has been found between 3H-paroxetine binding in rat<br>
frontal cortex and 3H-serotonin uptake inhibition.<br>
[0054] High affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor was established by testing the<br>
claimed compound"s ability to displace [3H] 8-OHDPAT (dipropylaminotetralin) from<br>
the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor following a modification of the procedure of Hall et al.,<br>
J. Neurochem. 44, 1685 (1985) which utilizes CHO cells stably transfected with<br>
human 5-HT1A receptors. The 5-HT1A affinities for the compounds of the invention<br>
are reported below as Ki"s.<br>
[0055] Antagonist activity at 5-HT1a receptors was established by using a 35S-<br>
GTPgS binding assay similar to that used by Lazareno and Birdsall (Br. J. Pharmacol.<br>
109: 1120, 1993), in which the test compound"s ability to affect the binding of 35S-<br>
GTPgS to membranes containing cloned human 5-HT1A receptors was determined.<br>
Agonists produce an increase in binding whereas antagonists produce no increase<br>
but rather reverse the effects of the standard agonist 8-OHDPAT. The test<br>
compound"s maximum inhibitory effect is represented as the lmax. white its potency is<br>
defined by the IC50.<br>
[0056] The results of the three standard experimental test procedures described in<br>
the preceding three paragraphs were as follows:<br>
[0057] Like the antidepressants fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, the<br>
compounds of this invention have the ability to potently block the reuptake of the<br>
brain neurotransmitter serotonin. They are thus useful for the treatment of diseases<br>
commonly treated by the administration of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor<br>
(SSRl) antidepressants, such as depression (including but not limited to major<br>
depressive disorder, childhood depression and dysthymia), anxiety, panic disorder,<br>
post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (also known as pre-<br>
menstrual syndrome), attention deficit disorder (with and without hyperactivity),<br>
obsessive compulsive disorders (including but not limited to trichotillomania),<br>
obsessive compulsive spectrum disorders (including but not limited to autism), social<br>
anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obesity, eating disorders such as<br>
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, vasomotor flushing, cocaine and alcohol<br>
addiction, sexual dysfunction (including but not limited to premature ejaculation),<br>
incontinence (including, but not limited to fecal incontinence, urge incontinence,<br>
overflow incontinence, passive incontinence, reflex incontinence, stress urinary<br>
incontinence urinary exertional incontinence and urinary incontinence), and related<br>
illnesses. Moreover, the compounds of this invention have potent" affinity for and<br>
antagonist activity at brain 5HT1A serotonin receptors. Recent clinical trials<br>
employing drug mixtures (eg, fluoxetine and pindolol) have demonstrated a more<br>
rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy for a treatment combining SSRl activity and<br>
5HT1A antagonism (Blier and Bergeron, 1995; F. Artigas et al., 1996; M. B. Tome et<br>
al., 1997). The compounds of the invention are thus exceedingly interesting and<br>
useful for treating depressive illnesses.<br>
[0056] Thus the present invention provides methods of treating, preventing,<br>
inhibiting or alleviating each of the maladies listed above in a mammal, preferably in<br>
a human, the methods comprising providing a pharmaceutically effective amount of a<br>
compound ot this invention to the mammal in need thereof.<br>
[0059] Also encompassed by the present invention are pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for treating or controlling disease states or conditions of the central<br>
nervous system comprising at least one compound of Formula I, mixtures thereof,<br>
and or pharmaceutical salts thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
therefore. Such compositions are prepared in accordance with acceptable<br>
pharmaceutical procedures, such as described in Remington"s Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 17th edition, ed. Alfonoso R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton,<br>
PA (1985). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those that are compatible<br>
with the other ingredients in the formulation and biologically acceptable.<br>
[0060] The compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally,<br>
neat or in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers. Applicable sollid<br>
carriers can include one or more substances that may also act as flavoring agents,<br>
lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids,<br>
binders or tablet-disintegrating agents or an encapsulating material. In powders, the<br>
carrier is a finely divided solid that is in admixture with the finely divided active<br>
ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the<br>
necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the<br>
shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 59% of<br>
the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate,<br>
magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl<br>
cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes<br>
and ion exchange resins.<br>
[0061] Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions,<br>
 syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or<br>
suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic<br>
solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid<br>
carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers,<br>
emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-reguiators.<br>
Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include<br>
water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably<br>
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols<br>
and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated<br>
coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier can also be an<br>
oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used<br>
in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
[0062] Liquid pharmaceutical compositions that are sterile solutions or suspensions<br>
can be administered by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous<br>
injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral<br>
administration may be either liquid or solid composition form.<br>
[0063] Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g. as<br>
tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or<br>
suppositories. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing<br>
appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms can be<br>
packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled<br>
syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a<br>
capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions<br>
in package form.<br>
[0064] The amount provided to a patient will vary depending upon what is being<br>
administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, and<br>
the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic<br>
applications, compounds of the present invention are provided to a patient already<br>
suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially ameliorate<br>
the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to<br>
accomplish this is defined as a "therapeutically effective amount." The dosage to be<br>
used in the treatment of a specific case must be subjectively determined by the<br>
attending physician. The variables involved include the specific condition and the<br>
size, age and response pattern of the patient. Generally, a starting dose is about 5<br>
mg per day with gradual increase in the daily dose to about 150 mg per day, to<br>
provide the desired dosage level in the human.<br>
[0065] Provide, as used herein, means either directly administering a compound or<br>
composition of the present invention, or administering a prodrug, derivative or analog<br>
which will form, an equivalent amount of the active compound or substance within the<br>
body.<br>
[0066] The present invention includes prodrugs of compounds of Formula 1, 1a and<br>
1b. Prodrug, as used herein, means a compound which is convertible in vivo by<br>
metabolic means (e.g. by hydrolysis) to a compound of Formula 1. Various forms of<br>
prodrugs are known in the art, for example, as discussed in Bundgaard, (ed.), Design<br>
of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985); Widder, et al. (ed.), Methods in Enzymology, vol. 4,<br>
Academic Press (1985); Krogsgaard-larsen, et al., (ed). "Design and Application of<br>

[0067] The following examples illustrate the production of representative<br>
compounds of this invention.<br>
INTERMEDIATE 1<br>
3-Allyloxy-4-methoxynitrobenzene<br>
[0068] 97.5 g (0.51 mole) of the sodium salt of 5-nitroguaiacol was dissolved in one<br>
liter of DMF and 1.5 equivalents of allyl bromide added. The reaction was heated to<br>
65°C for two hours, after which time much of the dark color had discharged and tic<br>
(1:1 CH2Cl2/hexane) indicated loss of starting material. The solvent was<br>
concentrated in vacuum and the residue washed with water. The product was<br>
isolated by filtration and dried in a vacuum. This gave 112 g of pale yellow solid. A<br>
sample recrystallized from methanol, gave m.p. 93-94°C.<br>
INTERMEDIATE 2<br>
2-Allyloxy-4-nitrophenol<br>
[0069] To one liter of dimethyl sulfoxide was added 750 mL of 2 N aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide and the mixture was heated to 65°C. The pale yeliow solid 3-aiiyloxy-4-<br>
methoxynitrobenzene prepared above was added in portions over a 30 minute period<br>
and then the temperature was raised to 95°C and maintained for 3 hours, after which<br>
time the starting material had been consumed. The mixture was allowed to coot and<br>
poured into a mixture of 1 L ice and 1 L 2 N HCI. 73 Grams of crude but<br>
homogeneous (by tlc 1:1 CH2Cl2/hexane) desired product was isolated as a light<br>
brown solid by filtration. This material was subsequently dissolved in 1:1<br>
hexane/rnethylene chloride and filtered through silica gel to give 68 g of pale yellow<br>
solid, which, when recrystallized from ethyl/acetate/hexane, gave m.p. 61-62°C. The<br>
aqueous mother liquors from the initial crystallization above were extracted with 2 L<br>
of ethyl acetate. This was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to a<br>
dark oil. Column chromatography on silica with 1:1 CH2Cl2/hexane gave an<br>
additional 12 g of the title compound as a yellow solid. Elution with 2% MeOH in<br>
CHCI3 gave 12 g of a dark oil which slowly crystallized in vacuum. This proved to be<br>
the Claisen product, 3-allyl-4-nitrocatechol.<br>
