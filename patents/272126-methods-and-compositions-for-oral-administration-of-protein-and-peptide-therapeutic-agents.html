				<td>METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE THERAPEUTIC AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to oral pharmaceutical compositions, comprising an intimate mixture of solid particulate ingredients within an oil carrier. Preferably the compositions are anhydrous. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise a particulate non-covalently associated intimate mixture of pharmacologically inert silica nanoparticles having a hydrophobic surface, a polysaccharide, and a biologically active protein or peptide where the particulate mixture is suspended or embedded in an oil or mixture of oils. The present invention further provides methods of manufacturing same and therapeutic methods utilizing same for oral delivery of the active protein or peptide.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Medical use of protein drugs is constrained by three major drawbacks. The first is their short biological half-life which requires, in some cases, frequent administrations. The second is the rapid degradation which occurs in mucosal tissues that generally cover the body cavities. Lastly, most protein drugs are large molecules and therefore do not easily cross the intestinal epithelium. As a result, the bioavailability of orally administered protein-based drugs is typically extremely low. Therefore, the most common mode of protein drugs administration is the parenteral route. However, apart from the inconvenience to the patients, parenteral delivery systems are also more expensive in terms of production and drug administration. There is therefore an unmet medical need for an effective non-parenteral mode of administration of protein drugs that will provide protection against biological degradation and/or enhance its transport across mucosal barriers. Although sophisticated non-parenteral pharmaceutical systems, such as intra-nasal systems, have been developed, oral administration is more favorable, having the major advantage of convenience for increased patient compliance.<br>
DNase, for example, is unstable in the presence of water, oxidative stress, temperature fluctuations, and acid pH conditions. The maximal activity is observed within a pH range of 6-8. These characteristics create difficulties for oral DNase administration. The only currently available methods of delivering active DNase to the plasma are via injection (IV, SC or IM). RNase can be deactivated by mutual interaction between different regions<br>
of the RNase molecule, and thus requires formulations capable of preventing this type of interaction.<br>
Examples of biologically active proteins include but are not limited to growth factors, cytokines, peptide hormones, analgesic peptides, enzymes, blood coagulating factors, peptide neurotransmitters, antibodies and may include synthetic polymers of amino acids. Specific examples of biologically active proteins or peptides include pituitary growth hormone, erythropoietin, DNase, RNase, and monoclonal antibodies among others.<br>
Biopolymers and their use in delivering active agents<br>
Biopolymers such as polysaccharides have been known for many years. Polysaccharides are widely used as excipients in oral dosage forms, as disclosed for example in US patent 6,667,060 to Vandecruys and US patent application 2004/0115264 to Blouquin. These references neither disclose nor suggest use of biopolymers in combination with nanoparticles or oil.<br>
Nanoparticles and their use in delivering active agents<br>
Silica nanoparticles are well known in the art as pharmaceutical excipients and are their use is disclosed for example in US patents 6,322,765 to Muhlhofer and 6,698,247 to Tennent, among many others. Coating of a nanoparticle-biopolymer complex with oil, or utility of same in oral administration of active agents are neither disclosed nor suggested.<br>
Methods for imparting a hydrophobic surface to nanoparticles are well known in the art and are described, for example in Chung et al (Hydrophobic modification of silica nanoparticle by using aerosol spray reactor. Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 236 (2004) 73-79). Additional methods include the reverse micelles method (Fu X, Qutubuddin S, Colloids Surf. A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 179: 65, 2001), liquid precipitation method (Krysztafkiewicz A, Jesionowski T, Binkowski S, Colloids Surf. A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 173:73, 2000) and sol-gel method (Jean J, Yang S, J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 83(8):1928, 2000; Zhang J, Gao L, Ceram. Int. 27: 143, 2001). Use of the nanoparticles in combination with biopolymers, coating a nanoparticles-biopolymer complex with oil, or utility of same in oral administration of active agents are neither disclosed nor suggested.<br>
US Patents 7,105,229, 6,989,195, 6,482,517, 6,638,621, 6,458,387, 7,045,146, and 5,462,866 among many others disclose use of nanoparticles or microparticles as excipients<br>
for  proteins.   These   references   neither   disclose   nor   suggest   intimate   non-covalent<br>
association of nanoparticles with a biopolymer or embedding of a nanoparticle-polymer matrix in an oil coating.<br>
US 2007/0154559 to Pai discloses an orally administrable composition containing nanoparticles comprising a charged water-soluble drug in complex with a counter-ion substance, a lipid, a polymer, and an emulsifier. The compositions are formed by (a) ionically bonding the drug with the counter-ion; (b) adding a lipid, a polymer, and a solubilizing agent; dissolving the whole mixture; and introducing the solution into an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier; and (c) removing the solubilizing agent. US 2006/0177495 and 2003/0235619 to Allen disclose delivery vehicles for delivering an active agent, comprising nanoparticles composed of a biodegradable hydrophobic polymer forming a core and an outer amphiphilic layer surrounding the polymer core and containing a stabilizing lipid.<br>
US 2006/0083781 to Shastri discloses nanoparticles comprising a lipid and a polymer comprising an ionic or ionizable moiety. These compositions as well differ significantly from those of the present invention, inter alia in that (a) the polymer is not outside the nanoparticles but rather forms a part of them; and (b) the oil forms a part of the nanoparticles instead of coating the nanoparticle-polymer mixture. In addition, the unique structure of the matrix carrier compositions of the present invention is neither disclosed nor suggested.<br>
WO 96/37232 to Alonso Fernandez discloses methods for preparation of colloidal systems through the formation of ionic lipid-polysaccharide complexes. The colloidal systems are stabilized through the formation of an ionic complex, at the interface, comprised of a positively charged aminopolysaccharide and a negatively charged phospholipid. These compositions as well differ significantly from those of the present invention, inter alia in that (a) the polymer is not outside the nanoparticles but rather forms a part of them; and (b) the oil forms a part of the nanoparticles instead of coating them. In addition, the unique structure of the matrix carrier of the present invention is neither disclosed nor suggested.<br>
US 6,548,264 to Tan et al. discloses silica-coated nanoparticles and a process for producing silica-coated nanoparticles. Silica-coated nanoparticles are prepared by precipitating nano-sized cores from reagents dissolved in the aqueous compartment of a water-in-oil microemulsion. A reactive silicate is added to coat the cores with silica. The<br>
silicate coating may further be derivatized with a protein. US 2007/0275969 to Gurny discloses pharmaceutical compositions for the oral administration of pharmaceutical agents having low water solubility. The pharmaceutical agents are solubilized with a polymer, from which nanoparticles are formed.<br>
In cosmetics formulations, it is common to use compositions comprising water-in-oil emulsions containing an aqueous phase dispersed in an oily phase. There are numerous examples in which silica nanoparticles as well as polysaccharides are included in the liquid fatty phase. US 6,228,377 for example, discloses water-in-oil emulsions containing a liquid fatty phase which contains hydrophobic or hydrophilic fumed silica, a branched polysaccharide alkyl ether, an emulsifying surfactant and oil. These compositions differ significantly from those of the present invention in that they include a water phase and surfactants that serve as the most important structure forming factor of the composition.<br>
Additional strategies<br>
Methods for oral administration of biologically active proteins and peptides are the object of extensive research efforts but have been proven generally inefficient to date. A number of strategies for preventing degradation of orally administered proteins have been suggested, including use of core-shell particles (US 7,090,868 to Gower) and nano-tubes (US 7,195,780 to Dennis). Liposomes have been used as a carrier for orally administered proteins, as well as aqueous emulsions and suspensions (US 7,316,818; WO 06/062544; US 6,071,535; and US 5,874,105 to Watkins) and gas-filled liposomes (US 6,551,576; US 6,808,720; and US 7,083,572 to Unger et al). Another composition comprises nanodroplets dispersed in an aqueous medium (US 2007/0184076). Additional strategies are found in WO 06/097793, WO 05/094785, and WO 03/066859 to Ben-Sason, which describe matrix-carriers containing peptide-effectors that provide penetration across biological barriers for administration of hydrophobic proteins; and EP0491114B1 to Guerrero Gomez-Pamo, which describes preparation of non-covalent protein-polysaccharide complexes for oral administration of biologically active substances, stabilized by precipitates of organic salts. None of these references discloses or suggests intimate non-covalent association of nanoparticles with a biopolymer or a nanoparticle-polymer matrix embedded in an oil coating.<br>
In addition to the differences outlined above, none of the above references discloses or suggests the enhanced bioavailability of compositions of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides matrix carrier compositions, suitable for the oral delivery of a protein or peptide active agent comprising a particulate matter comprising pharmacologically inert nanoparticles having a hydrophobic surface, in intimate non-covalent association with a polysaccharide and the protein or peptide, wherein the particulate matter is suspended in, embedded in or dispersed in oil. The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a biologically active protein or peptide in association with this matrix carrier composition, methods of manufacturing same, pharmaceutical compositions comprising same in association with a biologically active protein, and therapeutic methods utilizing same.<br>
An effective oral carrier for protein drugs should be able to shield its content against the luminal and brush border peptidases and be capable of facilitating the uptake of the protein drug, which is usually a large molecular weight entity, across the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. It is now disclosed for the first time that the compositions of the present invention surprisingly enable oral bioavailability of biologically active proteins and peptides. Whereas in prior art compositions very little if any therapeutic activity was achieved with oral formulations of peptide or protein agents, the present invention permits adsorption of the carried peptide or protein agent into the systemic circulation.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a matrix carrier composition for oral delivery of a protein or peptide active agent, comprising pharmacologically inert silica nanoparticles having a hydrophobic surface, wherein the size of the silica nanoparticles is between 1-100 nanometers, in intimate non-covalent association with at least one branched polysaccharide, and wherein the silica nanoparticle-polysaccharide complex is embedded in, dispersed in or suspended in oil. In another embodiment, the oil of the matrix carrier composition comprises a plurality of oils. In another embodiment, the weight of the particulate matter including the silica nanoparticles and the branched polysaccharide is not more than 25% of the overall weight of the composition. Preferably the weight of polysaccharides will be greater than the weight of the silica. In some embodiments the weight of the polysaccharides will be at least twice that of the silica, in other embodiments the weight of the polysaccharides will be 5 fold that of the silica in yet other embodiments<br>
the polysaccharides will be at least 10 times greater than the weight of silica nanoparticles. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>

In another embodiment, the hydrophobic portion of the biologically active protein or peptide is also non-covalently attached to hydrophobic portions of the biopolymer. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the matrix carrier composition of the present invention is held together by non-covalent forces (Figure 1). In another embodiment, the non-covalent forces between the components of the matrix composition enable the matrix composition to self-assemble when the components are blended together, as described herein. In another embodiment, the non-covalent forces cause the nanoparticles and biopolymer to form an intimate mixture. In another embodiment, the matrix composition exhibits an ordered, fractal structure. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the nanoparticle-biopolymer complex is dispersed within the oil phase of the matrix composition. In another embodiment, the oil phase is impregnated with the nanoparticle-biopolymer complex of the matrix composition.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of administering a biologically active protein or peptide to a subject in need thereof, comprising orally administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, thereby administering a biologically active protein or peptide to a subject.<br>
In certain embodiments, the active protein or peptide ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is capable of reaching the bloodstream of a subject, following oral administration, with over 20% of the biological activity intact, preferably over 30% of the biological activity remains intact, more preferably at least 40% of the biological activity remains intact, most preferably at least 50% of the biological activity remains intact. In another embodiment, over 60% of the biological activity remains intact. In another embodiment, over 70% of the biological activity remains intact. In another embodiment, over 80% of the biological activity remains intact. In another embodiment, over 90% of the biological activity remains intact. Without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, these properties are believed to be due to protection of the active agent from digestive enzymes and mechanical forces in the intestines by the excipients of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is designed to provide short-term release. "Short-term release", as used herein, refers to release within 8-12 hours, with maximal activity 4 hours after administration. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is designed to provide medium-term release. "Medium-term release", as used herein, refers to release within 12-18 hours, with maximal activity 4-6 hours after administration. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is designed to provide long-term release. "Long-term release", as used herein, refers to release within 18-48 hours, with maximal activity 4-8 hours after administration. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is designed to provide very long-term release. "Very long-term release", as used herein, refers to release within 18-72 hours, with maximal<br>
activity 6-8 hours after administration. In another embodiment, the longer term-release compositions of the present invention exhibit a lower peak with a longer tail following the peak activity. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a matrix carrier composition, the method comprising the steps of: (a) dry mixing nanoparticles having a hydrophobic surface, wherein the size of the nanoparticles is between 1-100 nanometers, with a biopolymer comprising a polysaccharide, whereby the nanoparticles form an intimate non-covalent association with the biopolymer; and (b) mixing the nanoparticles and biopolymer into an oil. Preferably, the nanoparticles and biopolymer form a complex. In another embodiment, the complex is embedded in the oil. In another embodiment, the particle size of the matrix carrier composition is between 100-500,000 nanometers (nm). In some preferred embodiments, the particle size is between 100-50,000 nm. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition, the method comprising the steps of: (a) dry mixing pharmacologically inert nanoparticles having a hydrophobic surface, wherein the size of the nanoparticles is between 1-100 nanometers, with a biopolymer comprising a polysaccharide, whereby the nanoparticles form an intimate non-covalent association with the biopolymer; (b) dissolving or dispersing a biologically active protein or peptide into an oil; and (c) mixing the intimate mixture of nanoparticles and biopolymer into the oil, whereby the nanoparticles, biopolymer, and protein or peptide become embedded in the oil. Preferably, the nanoparticles, biopolymer, and protein or peptide form a complex. In another embodiment, the complex is embedded, dispersed, immersed or suspended in the oil. In another embodiment, the biologically active protein or peptide is attached to the hydrophobic surfaces of the nanoparticles and the hydrophilic surfaces of the biopolymer via non-covalent forces. In another embodiment, the particle size of the matrix carrier composition is between 100-50,000 nanometers. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
It is to be explicitly understood that within the scope of the present invention, the compositions may comprise more than one biologically active protein or peptide. For example, each of the proteins or peptides may be mixed with at least one oil and then combined with the intimate mixture of dry particulate excipients. The oil or mixture of oils used for each protein or peptide may be the same or different. In alternative embodiments,<br>
two or more different peptides or proteins may be combined within a single mixture of solid particulate excipients and then mixed with the oil components. In alternative embodiments two or more active proteins or peptides may be individually combined with the particulate excipients and then these individual mixtures may be further mixed together with the oil components.<br>
As provided herein, methods have been developed to formulate a variety of biologically active proteins and peptides in orally administrable form. In certain preferred embodiments, the components are blended in a particular order in order to produce oil-coated matrix carrier compositions that protect the active ingredient from digestive processes in the stomach and small intestine. The biopolymer, particularly when branched, absorbs hydraulic and mechanical stresses experienced during digestion. The oil coating constitutes a physical barrier that provides additional protection against digestive enzymes.<br>
Further, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, matrix carrier compositions of the present invention are converted in the digestive system to particles smaller in size but similar in structure to the original composition (Figure 2), which are absorbed similarly to chylomicrons and reach the bloodstream without undergoing first-pass metabolism in the liver. The biological activity of proteins and peptides is largely preserved following oral administration in the compositions of the invention.<br>

In another embodiment, the biologically active polypeptide is a peptidomimetic, or small protein-like chain designed to mimic a peptide.<br>
In another embodiment, "peptidomimetic" refers to a peptide containing a non-naturally occurring amino acid or amino acid analog. In another embodiment, the amino acid analog is a D or L residue having the following formula: NH-CHR-CO, wherein R is an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, a benzyl group, a substituted benzyl group, an aromatic group or a substituted aromatic group and wherein R does not correspond to the side chain of a naturally occurring amino acid. This term also refers to the D-amino acid counterpart of naturally occurring amino acids. Amino acid analogs are well known in the art; a large number of these analogs are commercially available. In another embodiment, use of non-naturally occurring amino acids in the peptide has the advantage that the peptide is more resistant to degradation by enzymes which fail to recognize them.<br>
Alternatively, a functional group may be added to the side chain, deleted from the side chain or exchanged with another functional group. Examples of non-conservative substitutions of this type include adding an amine or hydroxyl, carboxylic acid to the aliphatic side chain of valine, leucine or isoleucine, exchanging the carboxylic acid in the side chain of aspartic acid or glutamic acid with an amine or deleting the amine group in the side chain of lysine or ornithine. In yet another alternative, the side chain of the substituting amino acid can have significantly different steric and electronic properties from the functional group of the amino acid being substituted.  Examples of such modifications<br>
include tryptophan for glycine, lysine for aspartic acid and -(CH2)4COOH for the side chain of serine.<br>
An amino acid analogue can be substituted for amino acid residues in the compounds of this invention both as conservative and as non-conservative substitutions. These peptidomimetic organic moieties either replace amino acid residues of essential and non-essential amino acids or act as spacer groups within the peptides in lieu of deleted amino acids (of non-essential amino acids). The peptidomimetic organic moieties often have steric, electronic or configurational properties similar to the replaced amino acid and such peptidomimetics are used to replace amino acids in the essential positions, and are considered conservative substitutions. However, such similarities are not necessarily required. The only restriction on the use of peptidomimetics is that the peptides retain their therapeutic properties. Peptidomimetics can be produced by organic synthetic techniques. Examples of suitable peptidomimetics include D amino acids of the corresponding L amino acids; tetrazol; isosteres of amide bonds; an LL 3 amino 2 propenidone 6 carboxylic acid. Further suitable peptidomimetics include hydroxyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylate; 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro- isoquinoline-3-carboxylate; histidine isoquinolone carboxylic acid (HIC); (2S, 3S) methyl phenylalanine, (2S, 3R) methyl phenylalanine, and (2R, 3S) methyl phenylalanine and (2R, 3R) methyl phenylalanine.<br>
The above examples of peptidomimetics are not meant to be limiting. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.<br>

As provided herein, methods have been developed to formulate a variety of biologically active proteins and peptides in orally administrable form. In certain preferred embodiments, the components are mixed in a particular order in order to produce a suspension of matrix carrier compositions that protect the active ingredient from digestive processes in the stomach. Without wishing to be bound by any theory of mechanism of action, the biopolymer, particularly when branched, absorbs hydraulic and mechanical stresses experienced during digestion. The oil coating constitutes a physical barrier that provides additional protection against digestive enzymes.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the secretion of bile acids causes dispersion of the oil suspension into smaller particles, which can be absorbed in the small intestine. The size of the nanoparticles influences the extent of dispersion of the solid phase within the oil, due to the unique structure of matrix carriers of the present invention. While the particle size is reduced after traversing the stomach and entering the small intestine, the particles remain within a size range of 30-1000 nm, too large to be substrate for lipases and peptidases, preserving the protective effect of the composition. In certain preferred embodiments, the particles remain within a size range of 30-700 nm after traversing the stomach and entering the small intestine (Figure 2). Advantageously, lipid-coating particles of this size are absorbed in a similar way to chylomicrons by lacteal vessels, which are lymphatic vessels originating in the villi of the small intestine. Particles absorbed in this manner can reach the bloodstream without undergoing first-pass metabolism, largely preserving the biological activity of the active agent.<br>
The following formulas and information provide guidance to those skilled in the art for practicing the present invention:<br>
The relative amounts of nanoparticles and biopolymer are calculated according to the following equation:<br>
V'SF * EbW * (1 ± 0.3) = VnSF * EbnSF.<br>
In the above equation:<br>
V'SF and VHSF are the volumes of the nanoparticles and biopolymer, respectively.<br>
EbIsF is the molecular bond energy of the nanoparticles (typically more than 3 eV). Eb"sF is the energy of the lowest molecular or hydrogen bond in the biopolymer.<br>
Matrix carriers for any protein or peptide of interest can be designed using the following principles:<br>
1.	The required concentration of the active agent in the final formulation is determined, based on previous experience, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.<br>
2.	Based on the above, the molar concentration of the active substance and total surface area of the nanoparticles and biopolymer are estimated.<br>
3.	The absorption area of the active substance is estimated, based on the active substance's molecular weight and three-dimensional structure. In the case of a globular molecule, the absorption area is 30-40% of the molecule's spherical surface. In the case of an elongated molecule, the absorption area is estimated to be the same as an area of a single strip with the length of molecule and the width of the widest molecule's molecular branch. Other molecules are estimated as a combination of both geometries.<br>
4.	The thickness of the protective oil layer is estimated based on the three-dimensional structure of the active molecule. It should be at least 10 times the diameter of a globular molecule or the maximal branch size of an elongated molecule. The thickness of the oil coating of matrix carriers of the present invention is determined by the following properties of the oil or mixture of oils: (a) the viscosity and melting temperature; (b) the acidity; and (c) the concentration of polar groups.<br>
5.	The estimated area of the nanoparticles necessary for the formation of the matrix carrier of the present invention is calculated. The area should be at least 10 times higher than the active substance's estimated absorption area as determined in step 3.<br>
6.	The estimated area of the biopolymer necessary for the formation of the matrix carrier of the present invention is calculated. The area should be at least 10 times higher than that of the nanoparticles as determined in step 5.<br>
7.	The first oil into which the active molecule is added is chosen, preferably an oil having a relatively low viscosity and low concentration of polar groups. Suitable examples are evening primrose oil, sesame oil, and silicon oil.<br>
8.	Inserting both solid phases into this oil leads to adsorption of the nanoparticles onto<br>
the surface of the biopolymer. This preserves the integrity of the protective oil layer.<br>
9.	A second oil component is added. The second oil is chosen based on its viscosity, which is commensurate with the desired rate of release of the active molecule from the matrix carrier.<br>
10.	A third oil component is added in order to improve the interaction between the active molecule and its target and further protect the active molecule from degradation. For example, sea buckthorn oil contains a significant quantity of antioxidants, vitamin E and beta-carotene, which protects the active molecule from active radicals and oxidation.<br>
The principles of the present invention are demonstrated by means of the following non-imitative examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Medium-term release DNase matrix carrier composition:<br>
The following formulation (DNase Formulation I) was designed for medium-term DNase release:<br>
30 ml jojoba oil and 120 ml sea buckthorn (Oblepicha) oil were combined in a beaker and stirred for 2 minutes (min) at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. 7 grams (g) of DNase was stirred into the oil mixture at 20 rpm for 2 min, then at 50 rpm for 5 min. 18 g of rice polysaccharides (Ambrotose™, Mannatech Inc, Coppell, TX 75019, USA) were weighed using an analytical scale, combined with 3 g of fumed hydrophobic silica R972 (Degussa Inc), and mixed by vortexing at 900 rpm for 5 min. Association between the Ambrotose™ and the silica was determined by the mixture's ability to float after being placed on the surface of a water-filled beaker. The Ambrotose™/silica mixture was added to the oil-DNase solution and stirred for 15 minutes at 50 rpm. 75ml of olive oil were added, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 3 min. The volume was brought up to 300 ml with sesame oil, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 20 min. The product was stored refrigerated (3-8 °C).<br>
In some experiments, the product is packaged into gelatin enteric covering capsules, such as those commercially available from Shionogi and Company, Ltd, Japan.<br>
In additional experiments, vitamin E is included in any one of the oils used to coat the matrix.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Slow-term-release DNase matrix carrier composition:<br>
The following formulation (DNase Formulation II) was manufactured to provide longer-term release:<br>
60 ml of jojoba oil and 120 ml of sea buckthorn (Oblepicha) oil were combined in a beaker and stirred for 2 minutes (min) at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. 6 g of DNase were stirred into the oil mixture at 20 rpm for 2 min, then 50 rpm for 5 min. 3 g of Benefiber™ (Novartis Nutrition GmbH, Germany) and 1.2 g of hydrophobic fumed silica R972 (Degussa Inc), were mixed by vortexing at 900 rpm for 5 min. The association between the Benefiber™ and the silica was determined by the mixture's ability to float after being placed on the surface of a water-filled beaker. The Benefiber™/silica mixture was then added to the oil-DNase solution and stirred for 25 minutes at 50 rpm. 75ml olive oil was added, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 3 min. The volume was brought up to 300 ml with sesame oil, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 20 min. The product was stored refrigerated (3-8 °C).<br>
In some experiments, the product is packaged into gelatin enteric covering capsules.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: In vivo release profiles of DNase matrix carrier compositions in mice:<br>
Experimental methods:<br>
The DNase activity in human serum was analyzed using the sensitive single radial enzyme diffusion (SRED) assay. In the single radial enzyme-diffusion (SRED) method for assay of deoxyribonuclease I, a precisely measured volume of the enzyme solution is dispensed into a circular well in an agarose gel layer in which DNA and ethidium bromide are uniformly distributed. A circular dark zone is formed as the enzyme diffuses from the well radially into the gel and digests substrate DNA. The diameter of the dark circle of hydrolyzed DNA increases in size with time and correlates linearly with the amount of enzyme applied to the well. The assay method can determine picogram to femtogram quantities of DNase I in 1 uL serum samples within 30 min. One unit of enzyme assayed corresponds to 0.6 ng of purified human DNase I. The experimental conditions used followed the ones described in Nadano D, et al„Clinical Chemistry 39: 448-452, 1993. The<br>
experimental results shown in Figure 3B were generated using the SRED method. The DNase activity in mice serum which results are displayed in Figure 3A were measured using the Samson-Med Bio-Assay.<br>
The data in Table 1 was generated using the Burton's method for measuring DNA levels as follows: Standard DNA solution (Sigma Cat. No D-1626) was diluted to 5, 10, 20 and 50 µg/ml in 10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with 10 mmol/1 MgCb, to generate a standard curve using the diphenylamine method (Burton K, Determination of DNA concentration with diphenylamine (DPA). In Methods in Enzymology ed. Grossman, L. &amp; Moldave, K. Vol. XIIB, pp. 163-166. New York: Academic Press. 1968). The amount of DNA in human serum was determined as follows: 200 µl of a plasma sample were mixed with 200 µl of IN HC1O4 and 600 µl of DPA. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours and then centrifuged for 10 min (15,000 g, 25°C). 300 ul of the supernatant were transferred to a 96 well plate and sample absorption at 600 nm was measured.<br>
RESULTS<br>
A comparison between the in vivo DNase activity of a fast-release DNase composition of the present invention (also called oral Oshadi DNase), injected DNase and orally administered DNase. While 50% of the initial DNase activity of the oral Oshadi DNase was retained after 12 hours, no activity was detected after only 6 hours for both injected and orally administered DNase. (Figure 3A).<br>
In another experiment, 75 mg of the above-described medium-term DNase matrix carrier oral composition was administered to human subjects, and serum DNase activity was measured. Potent activity was observed in all subjects at 4, 8, and 12 hours after administration (Figure 3B).<br>
In another experiment, 20 mg/day of the above-described medium-term DNase matrix carrier composition was administered orally to 4 human subjects for one week, and the concentration of free DNA in serum was measured in each subject independently. All subjects exhibited a decline in free DNA concentration in blood serum (Table 1).<br>
Table 1: Comparison of free DNA concentration in human serum before and after treatment with DNase.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The above Examples show that the release rate of matrix compositions of the present invention can be readily modulated as desired according to the needs of the subject and the therapeutic agent.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Preparation of RNase matrix carrier composition (RNase Formulation I)<br>
12 g Ambrotose™ rice polysaccharides were weighed with an analytical scale, combined with 4 g hydrophobic silica R972, and mixed by vortexing at 900 rpm for 5 min. Association between the Ambrotose™ and the silica was determined by the mixture's ability to float after being placed on the surface of a water-filled beaker. 120 ml linseed oil and 60 ml sea buckthorn (Oblepicha) oil were combined in a beaker and stirred for 2 minutes at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. 8 g RNase were weighed with an analytical scale and stirred into the oil mixture at 20 rpm for 1 min, then at 50 rpm for 3 min. The Ambrotose™/silica mixture was than added to the oil-RNase solution and stirred for 20 minutes at 50 rpm. 60 ml olive oil was than added, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 4 min. 10 tablets of "Plus" Dried Amino Acids (L-Glutamic Acid, Glycine, L-Lysine, L-Arginine; from Mannatech Inc, Coppell, TX 75019, USA) were pulverized, sifted to remove debris, then stirred into the mixture at 20 rpm for 30 min. The volume was brought up to 400 ml with sesame oil, and the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm for 5 min. The product was stored refrigerated (3-8 °C).<br>
In some experiments, the product is packaged into gelatin enteric covering capsules.<br>
EXAMPLE 5: In vivo release profile of RNase matrix carrier composition<br>
RNase activity was measured using the Samson-Med Bio-Assay as follows: 30 \x\ of serum were incubated for 10 min with 1 mg yeast RNA. Reduction in RNA concentration was observed and measured photometrically.<br>
RESULTS<br>
A comparison between the in vivo RNase activity of administered RNase matrix carrier composition (formulation III - example 4) (also called oral Oshadi RNase), injected RNase and orally administered RNase (control). The RNase activity was measured 3, 6 and 17 hours after administration of the RNase. While the formulation continued to impart RNase activity for the entire time tested (17 hours), the activity of the injected RNase reached background RNase levels after only 6 hours. In addition, the maximal RNase activity at the time points tested was 3-fold higher in the RNase matrix carrier composition than injected RNase. Orally administered RNase conferred no detectable activity (Figure 4).<br>

Benefiber™ (Novartis Nutrition GmbH, Germany) and silica were placed into a beaker and mixed by vortexing at 900 rpm for 5 min. Association between the Benefiber ™ and the silica was determined by the mixture's ability to float after being placed on the surface of a water-filled beaker. Actrapid™ insulin was added and stirred for 15 minutes at 50 rpm. Sesame oil and sea buckthorn (oblepicha) oil were combined in a beaker and vortexed on a<br>

EXAMPLE 7: Efficacy of the oral insulin composition of the present invention in diabetic mice:<br>
MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in male adult BALB/c mice (7-10 weeks old), weight 23-28 gr. Control mice were matched for age and weight.<br>
Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes treatment: Diabetes was induced by 2 injections of 500 and 700 µl of 1.5 mg/ml streptozotocin, separated by 48 hours, in male adult BALB/c mice (7-10 weeks old), of an average weight of 23-28 gr. Untreated mice of approximately the same age and weight were used as control. Blood glucose levels (BGL)<br>
were assessed 48 hours after STZ injection by a standard FreeStyle™ glucometer (Abbot Diabetes Cere Inc, Alameda, CA) from the tail vein blood samples.<br>
Insulin compositions were administered orally to mice by gavage (1 ml volume), without prior deprivation of food or water. During the experiment mice were supplied with food and water as usual.<br>
Compositions: The first experiment utilized Formulations V and VI described in Example 6. The second experiment utilized Formulation IV described in Example 6.<br>
Blood insulin concentration. Blood insulin concentrations were detected by ELISA (Human Insulin ELISA kit, Linco).<br>
Treatment groups:<br>
1.	Control group 1: no STZ treatment, no insulin administration.<br>
2.	Control group 2: no STZ treatment, oral insulin composition of the present invention administered by gavage.<br>
3.	Control group 3: STZ treated, no insulin administration.<br>
4.	Diabetic (STZ treated) mice; insulin administered by SC injection.<br>
5.	Diabetic (STZ treated) mice; insulin was administered by gavage.<br>
6.	Diabetic (STZ treated) mice; insulin was administered using the oral insulin composition of the present invention by gavage.<br>
7.	Diabetic (STZ treated) mice; matrix carrier (without insulin) administered by gavage a control.<br>
RESULTS<br>
In a first experiment, diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in male adult BALB/c mice, followed by administration of Actrapid™— (12 IU) and NovoRapid™- (9.5 IU) based insulin compositions (Formulation V and Formulation VI) of the present invention. Both compositions significantly reduced blood glucose levels (Figures 5B and 6, respectively). By contrast, STZ-treated mice that received empty matrix carrier compositions (lacking insulin), orally administered Actrapid™ or NovoRapid™ insulin, or were given 25 IU Insulin (BIOCON) in PBS (gavage) (Figure 7) did not exhibit significant reduction in blood glucose levels. Normal mice (not STZ-treated) that received insulin compositions exhibited no significant reduction in blood glucose level. Normal and diabetic<br>
mice injected with insulin, by contrast, exhibited hypoglycemia symptoms that were in some cases fatal.<br>
In a second experiment, an insulin composition (Formulation IV) of the present invention was administered orally to STZ-treated mice by gavage (1 ml volume) in dosages ranging from 2-10 IU. A dose-responsive reduction in blood glucose levels was observed for 9-12 hours; however, levels rarely dropped below 100 mg/dL (Figure 8A-D). The presence of human insulin in the blood following administration of the insulin matrix carrier composition was confirmed by ELISA. By contrast, subcutaneous injection of 10 IU of insulin caused near-fatal hypoglycemia (Figure 8E). Normal mice receiving 2, 5, or 10 IU insulin matrix carrier compositions exhibited only a slight reduction in blood glucose level (Figure 8F), while those receiving injected insulin experienced a precipitous and occasionally fatal drop in glucose levels. As before, STZ-treated mice that received empty matrix carrier compositions (lacking insulin), orally administered insulin, or were left untreated did not exhibit significant blood glucose level reduction.<br>
In another experiment, direct comparison of 10, 5, or 2 IU of insulin matrix carrier composition (Formulation IV) vs. injection of the same amount of insulin solution (the standard formulation) in 14-25 g mice reveled that mice treated with the oral insulin composition of the present invention maintained normal blood glucose levels for longer periods of time compared to the insulin injected mice. These observations reflect on the increased bioavailability of insulin when administered within the matrix carrier composition of the present invention. In addition, mice administered the matrix carrier compositions had no hypoglycemia, while the injected mice exhibited severe hypoglycemia (Figures 8G, H, I for 10, 5, and 2 IU, respectively).<br>
Indication for the increased bioavailability of the insulin administered orally using the compositions of the present invention in comparison with injected insulin can be found by calculating the "Effective Areas". "Effective Area" is defined as the sum of the net changes in blood glucose level (BGL) values relative to the basal level, along a defined period of time, calculated as follows:<br>
1.	Obtain a baseline average of BGL for each time point.<br>
2.	For each time point, subtract the BGL value in the treated groups (oral insulin<br>
composition of the present invention and injected insulin) from the baseline average.<br>
3.	Sum the values obtained in step 2 for all time points.<br>
To obtain the values in the table 3, the "effective areas" calculated of different treatments were then subtracted or divided.<br>
Table 3. Effective Areas of insulin oral matrix carrier compositions versus injected insulin.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As shown in Table 3, the relatively low 10IU/5IU and 10IU/2IU ratios for injected insulin indicate that these doses are approaching the saturation dose for the mice. By contrast, the relatively large ratios for the insulin matrix carrier composition indicate that it is far from the saturation doses. Thus, matrix carrier compositions of the present invention are more amenable to accurate dosing within their therapeutic range, compared with standard injected insulin formulations.<br>
Next, the effect of the oral insulin composition of the present invention was tested on two human subjects, one healthy and one diabetic. 30 IU of Actrapid™ matrix carrier composition (Formulation II) reduced blood glucose levels in the healthy subject from 105 to 80-90 mg/dL over a six-hour test period (Figure 9A). The subject reported an unusual<br>
degree of hunger, but otherwise no adverse reactions. By contrast, administration of injected insulin to healthy subjects is known to cause hypoglycemia, in some cases severe, with accompanying adverse reactions.<br>
10 IU of the formulation V were administered 3 times per day over 14 days to a 67-year-old subject having type I/II diabetes, who exhibited glucose levels of over 170 when untreated and 130-170 when receiving Gluco-Rite™. Upon taking formulation V the blood glucose levels dropped to an average of about 130 (Figure 9B). The subject reported feeling well during the entire period of receiving the oral insulin composition of the present invention. The subject has continued to take the compositions 3-4 times per day, as needed, resulting in well-controlled glucose levels with no adverse reactions. By contrast, the subject had a long-standing history of intense sensations of dread and unease after receiving a number of different injected insulin formulations.<br>
The presence of elevated insulin levels in the diabetic subject's blood following administration of the insulin composition was confirmed by ELISA. Thus, matrix carrier compositions of the present invention are capable of orally delivering various forms of insulin in a biologically active form that can effectively treat diabetes. They have the additional advantage of not inducing hypoglycemia in either diabetic or normal subjects.<br>
EXAMPLE 8: Toxicity study of chronic oral administration of insulin compositions<br>
MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
Fifteen 10 week-old Balb/C male mice were used. Mice were administered daily lml of insulin matrix carrier composition (25IU/ml) (experimental group) or PBS (gavage control group) via gavage over 15 days. On the 14th and 15th day, mice were administered orally 100ng of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) together with the insulin matrix carrier composition or PBS. Negative control mice were administered lml PBS by gavage over 13 days, and l00ng of LPS in lml PBS by gavage on the 14th and 15th day. Positive control mice were injected with lmg of LPS in lml of PBS. 3h after LPS administration, mice were sacrificed, blood was collected (for LPS detection) and gastro-system, liver and kidneys were fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% for histological analysis.<br>
Animal follow up and macroscopic analysis: Mice were weighed every 3 days, and their fur condition was detected daily. After sacrifice, all organs or tissues were investigated for the presence of pathological changes<br>
Internal organs collection and fixation: On day 15 mice were sacrificed, and their gastro-system, kidney, and liver were collected from the abdominal cavity, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin solution.<br>
Blood collection and plasma preparation: Blood was collected from the heart of the mice into tubes that contain EDTA. Plasma was be separated from the blood by centrifugation; at first for 15 min at 3000×gmax followed by 15 min at 16,000xgmax. Supernatant was removed, placed in a new tube and stored at -20°C.<br>
Detection of LPS in mouse serum: LPS in mouse serum was detected by HPLC. Sera taken on day 15 from the groups described above were prepared for HPLC analysis by addition of 0.1 M of EDTA.<br>
RESULTS<br>
The toxicity of chronic administration of oral insulin compositions of the present invention was investigated. No pathological changes were observed in the animals' behavior. Their fur was in normal condition, appearing smooth, clean, and bright. No weight loss was detected; the mice gained weight normally.<br>
Macroscopic analysis:<br>
Macroscopic analysis of internal organs revealed no evidence of any pathology. Organs of all mice were normally developed, had normal size, shape, appearance (bright and smooth), and weight, were normally colored, and were in their normal location. Microscopic analysis showed no evidence of pathology in tissues of mice in all groups (liver- Figure 10A; kidney- Figure 10B; duodenum- Figure IOC).<br>
Serum from the treated and untreated mice were also tested for the presence of LPS. LPS was not present in serum of mice given oral insulin composition of the present invention + LPS (Figure 11, curve C), nor in serum of mice given 1ml PBS + LPS (Figure 11, curve D), showing that neither the matrix carrier composition nor the gavage compromised the integrity of the mice's gastrointestinal linings. Serum from mice injected lmg of LPS in 1ml of PBS served as a positive control (Figure 11, curve A), and untreated mice served as negative control (Figure 11, curve B).<br>
EXAMPLE 9: Preparation of erythropoietin matrix carrier composition:<br>
An erythropoietin (EPO) matrix carrier composition was produced, using the following ingredients:<br>
EPREX™ epoetin alpha, 1 ml<br>
Olive oil, 7 ml<br>
Ambrotose™, 0.6 g<br>
Silica, 0.1 g<br>
Oblepicha oil, 8 ml<br>
Linseed oil<br>
The composition was prepared as described above in previous Examples. The volume in this composition was brought up to 20 ml with linseed oil. The final EPO concentration was 150IU/ml.<br>
EXAMPLE 10: In vivo release profile of erythropoietin matrix carrier composition:<br>
The in vivo release profile of the EPO matrix carrier composition from Example 9 was determined in rats. Relative reticulocyte count was measured after oral administration of matrix composition containing 200 IU EPO. The EPO composition was administered twice on days 1 and 4 of the study; blood samples were drawn on day 10 (2 doses; 5 rats). As a control, matrix carrier without EPO was administered (5 rats). Administration of the EPO matrix carrier potently stimulated reticulocyte formation (Figure 12).<br>
EXAMPLE 11: EPO activity in normal and anemic rats administered erythropoietin matrix carrier composition:<br>
Male SD rats were subjected to nephrectomy surgery removing 5/6 of the kidneys, to serve as a kidney failure model; control rats were left intact. 1 ml of the EPO matrix carrier composition from Example 9 was administered orally to rats by gavage, overall 150 IU EPO were administered. EPO levels were measured by ELISA (Human EPO Immunoassay by Quantikine™ IVD) at various time points between 1 -24 hours after EPO<br>
administration. The EPO was efficiently absorbed by both normal and nephrectomy rats (Figure 13).<br>
In other experiments, 150 IU EPO was either administered orally in a matrix carrier composition on days 1 and 5 or was administered subcutaneously on days 1 and 5. Reticulocyte and hemoglobin blood counts were performed at different times between 2-5 weeks after EPO administration. The EPO matrix carrier composition was equally effective as the injected EPO. Data from a representative time point is depicted in Table 4.<br>
