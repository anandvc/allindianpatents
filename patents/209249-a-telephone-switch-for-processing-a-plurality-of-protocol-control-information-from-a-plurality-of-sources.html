				<td>This invention relates to improved telephone switch.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved telephone switch for processing a plurality of protocol control information a plurality of sources.<br>
This invention still more particularly relates to improved telephone switch connected to a plurality of sources of protocol information having a system for processing control information in said switch.<br>
Communication switches as shown in the specifications of US Patent No.4, 688, 212. Such systems are typically divided into two parts. The first part is the central processing unit or the CPU The CPU provides the functions of digit analysis, routing algorithms, special features such as speed dialing and billing or call authorization or call authorization. A second part of the telephone switch generally identified as a switching unit provides the functions of call processing including port or slot switching and the transmission of PCM or voice data or signaling data to the designated ports or slots. Certain direct functions, as are well known, are performed by the Switching Unit. These are provision of an off hook signal, digit manipulation and call acknowledgement.<br>
The CPU provides disk storage, a master processing unit (MPU), a bus master arbiter to control transmissions from the main processing unit to the Switching Unit ( C Bus service Unit} and a serial bus interface unit (SBIU) controlling the information within the modules of MPU.<br>
In the Switching Unit, a Telephone Switching unit (TSU) and signal Switching Unit (SSU) provides access between the<br>
2<br><br>
slots or ports in the telephone switch for external connection of the telephone switch to a central office or to other ports or slots in the telephone switch. For example, the TSU may provide a direct connection for PC voice and signaling information to a peripheral card which may connect externally to a digital trunk unit such as Tl unit as used in the U.S. or an El unit as used internationally, for connection to central offices, or direct connection to another port or slot. The SSU may provide a direct connection to another port in that SSU or to another port connected to another SSU within the switch or for the external connection to that port or slot in another SSU or TSU,<br>
In the process of using a telephone switch, information may be received from an external source, such as a Tl trunk. This information may be in the form of a designated communi-cation protocol required to be interpreted in terms of that designated protocol by the telephone switch. That interpreted protocol may then be used to construct or remove connections for telephone communications transaction. Accordingly, information received from an external source may be required to be interpreted as protocols by software programs in the telephone switch. Provision for adding or deleting those software programs relating to these protocols and for interpreting the information processed from these protocols should be aaade available and easy to add, delete or change, After processing of the protocol information there is a requirement for transmitting the processed information from the Switching Unit to the central processing unit. This<br>
3<br><br>
communication using the buses internal to the telephone switch for communicating the processed or interpreted protocol information between the Switching Unit and the central processing unit reduces the speed of the telephone switch.<br>
As seen, information may be received relating to particular communications protocols.  This protocol information is processed and then the processed information is used by the telephone switch, for example, to establish and reduce circuit switch telephone calls and complete transactions. As protocols change and a telephone switch is required to process a plurality of protocols, a capability for modularly adding protocols and the equipment for processing the information within the protocols facilitates use of the switch. Additionally, a telephone processor should have capability for transmission of the processed protocol information to its central processor where that information is designated for use in establishing telephone routing within the switch.<br>
In our corresponding application No. 198/CAL/95 we have described and claimed a system for processing control informations in a switch*/ An object is to provide broad processing capability for receiving and processing information over voice communication channels from the telephone   switch and for providing the processed information from the Switching Unit to a central processing unit, for processing of the call.<br>

Figure I depicts a Telephone Interchange Unit or Switch is shown simplified for explanation purposes as having a centralized processing unit (CPU) and a Switching Unit (SU).   As shown, the SU and CPU communicate through an R bus.   Control over the R bus is by a C bus service unit (CSU) shown connected to the C bus within the central processing unit.  Information-may be clocked onto the T bus in the Switching Unit through the Telephone Timing Unit (TTU).  Additional functions provided in the central processing unit and shown connected to the C bus are a main processing unit (MPU), and telephone processing unit (TPU), an auxiliary processing unit (APU) for providing auxiliary processing functions, a serial bus interface unit (SBIU) and disk storage.<br>
The centralized processing unit provides, through the MPU. digit analysis, routing algorithms, special features, such as speed dialing, billing and call authorization.<br>
The TPU within the centralized processing unit provides telephone switching information for construction or removal of call transactions made through the Switching Unit, as explained below.<br>
The Switching Unit as shown includes a T bus for communications between the 'ITU, as explained above, a Conference and Tones Unit (CTU), and a signaling switch unit and a telephone switch unit (SSU, TSU).   The ports or slots of the switch, 0   through N for example, may be connected through a peripheral card such as a Tl card as shown in Figure 1. to the SSU and TSU.   The function of the SSU and TSU is to complete call connections and arrange call transactions between any of the slots or ports 0 through N on the peripheral card Tl, or to slots or ports on other peripheral cards connected to that SSU/TSU or to another SSU/TSU.<br><br>
The peripheral card connected to a single SSU, TSU unit for switching between ports or slots is shown as representative, it being understood that the plurality of such peripheral cards and SSU and TSU capability may be included with any telephone interchange unit, as is well known by those skilled in the art.<br>
The peripheral card connections 0 through N are connected through ports or slots and to external connections such as central offices, trunk lines, or to other telephone sets.   It is the function of the TSU in the preferred embodiment to connect the slots or ports according to the information received on any one particular, line 0 through N.   In the preferred embodiment PCM voice information is provided, to the TSU and signaling information may be provided through the SSU.  The signaling information transmitted through the SSU in the preferred embodiment is an 8 kilobyte per second rate as compared to the 64 kilobit per second PCM voice data rate for information transmitted through the TSU.   In the preferred embodiment, signaling information is used in connection with telephone or daia sets dedicated to the. Switching Unit.<br>
Information is transmitted by the T bus and through the R bus 10 the TPU and MPU within (he CPU.   The CPU receiving the information does digit analysis, performs routing algorithms, and provides special features such as speed billing and call authorization. Information related to call construction for call transactions to the telephone switch are produced within the TPU and are transmitted to the TSU where connections arc made in accordance to the data or instructions received from the information in the received call, the TPU and MPU and the data from the IMP, as explained below.<br>
A peripheral card as shown in Figure 1. connected to the SSU and TSU is shown in greater detail in Figure 2.  A peripheral card as may be used in the preferred embodiment, is shown as having 24 ports or slots.. The signaling and PCM voice data is communicated in 24 channels to the SSU and TSU, and from the SSU and TSU to the T bus.   The 64 kbps PCM voice data is transmitted through the TSU directly to other ports on the same peripheral card or through the PCM bus (not shown) to other ports on other peripheral cards thrpugh respective TSUs.<br>
The information received directly from a port such as any one of the ports 0 thorugh N, may be through a dedicated connection to signaling system protocols    Those Protocols such Signaling System 7 (SS7) as specified in the ITU-T (CCITI) documents numbered<br>
11<br><br>
Q.701-Q.704.MTP are used for routing data over high speed signaling links.   The data is used to establish and remove circuits for switch telephone calls and to  complete transactions to service control points in the SS7 network.   The Protocol is also responsible for network maintenance of the signaling links.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a capability for receiving Protocols, from dedicated lines for example, directly by a processing unit capable of processing those Protocols and providing the processed information to the CPU for completing or removing links for call transactions, within the telephone switch.  For example, a Protocol such as Q.921(PRI layer 2), or X.25 or Frame relay as received, may require processing according to processing programs dedicated for respective Protocols.  The Protocol processed information is then transmitted to the CPU for constructing or removing links used for call transactions between the ports or slots connected into the switch as described above.   According to the principles of the invention as shown in the preferred embodiment, these processors may be located directly on peripheral cards in the Switching Unit.   In this way, the protocol processing units are accessible for installation, removal or modification as required.   The protocol processors provided on peripheral cards permit dedicated processing of each received protocol independently of any other protocols and without intervention of the central processing unit.<br>
A schematic of the PCU and associated data paths between the CPU and a peripheral card shelf containing the PCU card is as shown in Figure 3.<br>
As shown the PCU in the preferred embodiment has 32 ports, 0 to 31. and is located on a peripheral card, communicating with the TSU in the preferred embodiment through 32 channels.  Accordingly, the 64 kbps PCM data may be operated at a 2.048 Mbps rate representing the 32 channels at 64 kbps each.<br>
Each of the Switching Unit slot or port connections to the PCU, 0 through 31, represent designated slot or port within the telephone switch.   Within the "PCU, each of the PCU slots or connections are dedicated to a Switching Unit port or slot connection by the CPU.<br>
The PCU peripheral card is shown in detail in Figure 4.<br>
The PCU is directly connected through back plane of the Switching Unit of the telephone switch, to the Switching Unit and to the. TSU.<br>
12-<br><br>
As shown for the PCU in Figure 4., slots are provided lor each of the IMP processors shown in slots 0 through 4 and for the ENET processor shown in slot 5.   (M Bus control is through a field programmable gate array.   In the preferred embodiment, each IMP reads the information on the IM Bus and each -accepts  information designated for that respective IMP. In the preferred embodiment, a telephony bus providing access to 32 ports of 64 kbps serial packet data may be routed to the PCU and on to the PCU 2.048 Mbps IM Bus.  Under the addressing control of.the telephone switch, each of the designated slots within the PCU shown for an IMP may be given more than one slot or port address and each IMP may be used to process data received from one or more slots or ports, using the technique of time domain multiplexing.<br>
Accordingly, each IMP may process information received from any slot or port external to the switch over 32 port channels as given .by the (designated port address registered in the T?V of the CSU.<br>
Each of the IMP processors (IMP) as located within each of the slots shown in figure 4. for the PCU is shown in Figure 5, in greater detail.   As shown, an IM bus buffer controls access to the bus for each IMP.  Control and serial data information is provided to a field programmable gate array (FPGA) such as a Xilink 4G0J-5, and to a microprocessor.   In the preferred embodiment, the microprocessor is a 68302 operating at 20 MHz.   A local microbus operating and 3 MBytes per second in the preferred embodiment is located within each IMP and provides communications between the microprocessor, the FPGA, a 256 kbyte flash prompt containing a boot program and a 2M byte containing the particular program for a dedicated Protocol.<br>
An operation in accordance with the address instructions provided by the TPU within the CSU to the TSU, a protocol received at a port or slot connection on a peripheral card is routed by addressing instructions provided by the TPU to the TSU and routed to the address corresponding to the IMP contained in thc-PCU. As would be known to those skilled in the art, each of the IMPs located in each of the slots on the PCU then read the information on the bus and select that protocol which is designated for that respective IMP passing  any protocol designated for another IMP.   The processed information is placed bark on the IM bus within the PCU and routed to the ENET slot where it is transmitted to the SBIU within the CPU over a dedicated LAN.   This dedicated link is operated at 10 Mbps and provides direct<br><br>
communication without interrupting any of the communications carried by the R Bus.<br>
The ENET module shown in slot 5 in Figure 4.. includes an IM bus buffer to control the information passed from the IM bus to the ENET module, a FPGA and processor.   The FPGA may by a Xilinx 3064 and the processor may be an ST-NfC (network interface processor) LAN Co-processor operated at 20 MHz.   An SRAM containing 128 kbytes of information provides the program for processing the information received from,the IM bus and transmitted through the ENET physical layer interface to the local area network.<br>
A switch provides time multiplexed connections between ports or slots, and information in the form of digital words are transmitted in packets.    A Switching Unit makes the connectors and disconnections between the ports under the control of a central processing unit and a telephone processing unit.  These connections and disconnections are organized according to protocols located in software programs on a Integrated multi-protocol processing unit (IMP) located on a peripheral card within the Switching Unit.   An IMP includes processing systems for processing the protocols in response to data received through a respective slot and transmitted to the IMP. A switch may include a plurality of IMP's. Each IMP may include a plurality of separate processors, each for a separate and distinct protocol. The protocol processed data is transmitted to the CPU directly without use of the switch increasing the speed of communications.<br>
