[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"DECLARATIVE SEQUENCED REPORT PARAMETERIZATION"<br>
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a corporation of the State of Washington<br>
having a place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington<br>
98052, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
1<br>
DECLARATIVE SEQUENCED REPORT PARAMETERIZATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of information systems. More particularly,<br>
this invention relates to the parameterization of data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Information systems often need to retrieve values from a user so that the appropriate<br>
information is delivered to the user at the right time. In query-based reporting systems, this can<br>
be accomplished through report parameterization. Parameters allow for reports to be customized<br>
based on user choices. Conventional reporting products, however, only provide static parameter<br>
selection. In this manner, data dependencies are not exploited by the report generator, leading to<br>
inefficient processing and presentation of data and reports. Moreover, conventional reporting<br>
products provide inefficient and unfriendly presentation of subsequent data and selectable<br>
parameters to the user.<br>
For example, Figure 2 is a flowchart of a conventional method of report processing and<br>
generation. At step 200, a report definition is retrieved which includes the list of parameters and,<br>
if specified, the possible values for each parameter. Then, at step 230, a parameter from the list<br>
is retrieved and it is determined at step 240 if the parameter is marked for dropdown (it has<br>
multiple possible values). If so, all the possible values of the field are selected at step 250, and<br>
provided to the user. This can be a long cumbersome list of values. The user is then prompted<br>
for a value from the dropdown list(s) at step 260. If the parameter is not marked for dropdown at<br>
step 240, then processing proceeds directly to step 260 with the user being prompted for value(s)<br>
(not from a dropdown list). It is then determined at step 270 if any parameters are remaining in<br>
the list from step 220. If so, processing returns to step 230. After all of the parameters have<br>
been retrieved and used to prompt the user for value(s), then a report is executed, at step 280. It<br>
should be noted that in this conventional method, data dependencies are not exploited by the<br>
report generator, and the choices presented to the user are not dynamically determined or subset-<br>
limited based on his previous selections.<br><br>
2<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide a dynamic reporting product including systems<br>
and methods that overcome the problems of the prior art and more precisely and efficiently tailor<br>
information delivery to a user's needs. It is desirable to provide cascaded parameters, such that a<br>
user selectable parameter is dependent on an earlier user selection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to improved report parameterization systems and<br>
methods in which user values and selections are collected and provided to a report sewer that<br>
customizes a generically defined report pursuant to the user values and selections.<br>
An ordered set of report parameters is declared in the definition of a report and then this<br>
parameter definition is used to drive user prompting and execution of the report. As parameter<br>
values are collected in sequence order, a value retrieved or specified by the user for one<br>
parameter may be used to generate the set of the allowed values or default value of a parameter<br>
later in the sequence. Parameters are dynamically presented to the user. After values for all<br>
parameters been retrieved or specified, a report is generated by the report server.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the<br>
following detailed description of illustrative embodiments that proceeds with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Overview<br>
Parameterized reports provide flexibility by allowing a report designer to specify a set of<br>
values that can be supplied by the user during report execution. Data is transformed from a<br>
database into a readable form, with information that a user wishes to see and not other data.<br>
Parameters are used to constrain data or highlight data, for example. Parameters are dynamically<br>
presented to the user. For example, if the user is prompted to select a state of residence and the<br>
user selects "Washington", then the next choices that are presented to the user are constrained to<br>
the cities in Washington.<br>
Exemplary Computing Environment<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an example of a suitable computing system environment 100 in which<br>
the invention may be implemented. The computing system environment 100 is only one<br>
example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to<br>
the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the computing environment<br>
100 be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination<br>
of components illustrated in the exemplary operating environment 100.<br>
The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose<br>
computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems,<br>
environments, and/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices,<br>
multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer<br><br>
4<br>
electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing<br>
environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.<br>
The invention may be described in the general context pf computer-executable<br>
instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer, Generally, program<br>
modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures; etc. that perform<br>
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced<br>
in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices<br>
that are linked through a communications network or other data transmission medium. In a<br>
distributed computing environment, program modules and other data may be located in both<br>
local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes<br>
a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer 110. Components of computer<br>
110 may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit 120, a system memory 130, and a<br>
system bus 121 that couples various system components including the system memory to the<br>
processing unit 120. The system bus 121 may be any of several types of bus structures including<br>
a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of<br>
bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry<br>
Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA<br>
(EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral<br>
Component Interconnect (PCI) bus (also known as Mezzanine bus).<br>
Computer 110 typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer<br>
readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer 110 and includes<br>
both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example,<br>
and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and<br>
communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and non-volatile,<br>
removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of<br>
information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other<br>
data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash<br>
memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical<br>
disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage<br>
devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can<br><br>
5<br>
accessed by computer 110. Communication media typically embodies computer readable<br>
instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a<br>
carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information deliver}' media. The<br>
term "modulated data signal" means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or<br>
changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not<br>
limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired<br>
connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media.<br>
Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable<br>
media.<br>
The system memory 130 includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and/or<br>
non-volatile memory such as ROM 131 and RAM 132. A basic input/output system 133 (BIOS),<br>
containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer<br>
110, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM 131. RAM 132 typically contains data<br>
and/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being operated on<br>
by processing unit 120. By way of example, and not limitation, Figure 1 illustrates operating<br>
system 134, application programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data 137.<br>
The computer 110 may also include other removable/non-removable, volatile/non-<br>
volatile computer storage media. By way of example only, Figure 1 illustrates a hard disk drive<br>
140	that reads from or writes to non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk<br>
drive 151 that reads from or writes to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk 152, and an<br>
optical disk drive 155 that reads from or writes to a removable, non-volatile optical disk 156,<br>
such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable/non-removable, volatile/non-<br>
volatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment<br>
include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile<br>
disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like.   The hard disk drive<br>
141	is typically connected to the system bus 121 through a non-removable memory interface<br>
such as interface 140, and magnetic disk drive 151 and optical disk drive 155 are typically<br>
connected to the system bus 121 by a removable memory interface, such as interface 150.<br>
The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated<br>
in Figure 1, provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules<br>
and other data for the computer 110. In Figure 1, for example, hard disk drive 141 is illustrated<br><br>
6<br>
as storing operating system 144, application programs 145, other program modules 146, and<br>
program data 147. Note that these components can either be the same as or different from<br>
operating system 134, application programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data<br>
137. Operating system 144, application programs 145, other program modules 146, and program<br>
data 147 are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different<br>
copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer 110 through input<br>
devices such as a keyboard 162 and pointing device 161, commonly referred to as a mouse,<br>
trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick,<br>
game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected<br>
to the processing unit 120 through a user input interface 160 that is coupled to the system bus,<br>
but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or<br>
a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also connected to<br>
the system bus 121 via an interface, such as a video interface 190. In addition to the monitor,<br>
computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers 197 and printer<br>
196, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface 195.<br>
The computer 110 may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to<br>
one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer 180. The remote computer 180 may<br>
be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network<br>
node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer<br>
110, although only a memory storage device 181 has been illustrated in Figure 1. The logical<br>
connections depicted include a local area network (LAN) 171 and a wide area network (WAN)<br>
173, but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in<br>
offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 110 is connected to the<br>
LAN 171 through a network interface or adapter 170. When used in a WAN networking<br>
environment, the computer 110 typically includes a modem 172 or other means for establishing<br>
communications over the WAN 173, such as the Internet. The modem 172. which may be<br>
internal or external, may be connected to the system bus 121 via the user input interface 160, or<br>
other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to<br>
the computer 110, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By<br>
way of example, and not limitation, Figure 1 illustrates remote application programs 185 as<br><br>
7<br>
residing on memory device 181. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are<br>
exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may<br>
be used.<br>
Exemplary Distributed Computing Frameworks Or Architectures<br>
Various distributed computing frameworks have been and are being developed in light of<br>
the convergence of personal computing and the Internet. Individuals and business users alike are<br>
provided with a seamlessly interoperable and web-enabled interface for applications and<br>
computing devices, making computing activities increasingly web browser or network-oriented.<br>
For example, MICROSOFT®'s .NET platform includes servers, building-block services,<br>
such as web-based data storage, and downloadable device software. Generally speaking, the<br>
.NET platform provides (1) the ability to make the entire range of computing devices work<br>
together and to have user information automatically updated and synchronized on all of them, (2)<br>
increased interactive capability for web sites, enabled by greater use of XML rather than HTML,<br>
(3) online services that feature customized access and delivery of products and services to the<br>
user from a central starting point for the management of various applications, such as e-mail, for<br>
example, or software, such as Office .NET, (4) centralized data storage, which will increase<br>
efficiency and ease of access to information, as well as synchronization of information among<br>
users and devices, (5) the ability to integrate various communications media, such as e-mail,<br>
faxes, and telephones, (6) for developers, the ability to create reusable modules, thereby<br>
increasing productivity and reducing the number of programming errors, and (7) many other<br>
cross-platform integration features as well.<br>
While exemplary embodiments herein are described in connection with software residing<br>
on a computing device, one or more portions of the invention may also be implemented via an<br>
operating system, API, or a "middle man" object between a coprocessor and requesting object,<br>
such that services may be performed by, supported in, or accessed via all of .NET's languages<br>
and services, and in other distributed computing frameworks as well.<br>
Exemplary Embodiments<br>
An ordered set of report parameters is declared in the definition of a report and then this<br>
parameter definition is used to drive user prompting and execution of the report (a report<br>
definition is described further below with respect to Figure 5). An exemplary definition of a<br><br>
8<br>
parameter includes: name of parameter; data type (string, number, date, etc.): set of allowed<br>
values or an optional query used to retrieve set of allowed values; the default value or an optional<br>
query used to retrieve the default value and whether to prompt the user for a value. The allowed<br>
values and default values queries can be arbitrarily complex and are desirably defined by the<br>
designer of the report.<br>
In addition, the allowed values and default values queries can be parameterized by the<br>
values of previously specified parameter values.<br>
This enables a value retrieved or specified by the user for one parameter to be used to<br>
generate the set of the allowed values or default values of a parameter later in the sequence.<br>
After values for all parameters been retrieved or specified, a report is generated by the report<br>
server.<br>
As an example, assume a report definition with two parameters, "Product Category"<br>
and "Product Name". The list of product categories is retrieved from a database and the user is<br>
prompted to select one item in the list. Once the user makes a selection, a list of product names<br>
within the selected category is retrieved from a database. The user then selects one product name<br>
from the list and the report executes using the selected product.<br>
As another exemplary scenario involving dynamic parameter lists and defaults of the<br>
present invention, assume that there exist three parameters defined for a report, "Region",<br>
"State" and "City". A user interface is display with three dropdown lists used for input for each<br>
parameter. The "Region" dropdown is populated with the regions in the United States. When a<br>
region is selected (e.g., northwest) the data source associated with the State parameter is queried<br>
using the region that was selected in the "Region" dropdown list as a query parameter. The<br>
"States" dropdown list is populated with the result set from the parameter query. When a<br>
selection is made in the "States" dropdown list (e.g., Washington) the data source associated<br>
with the "City" parameter is queried using the state that was selected in the "State" dropdown list<br>
as a query parameter.<br>
Figure 3 is a high level block diagram of an exemplary system in accordance with the<br>
present invention. A report server 300, comprising a report processor 310 and a data processor<br>
315, interacts with a requesting computer 320, as set forth above. The report server 300 accesses<br>
a storage device, such as an external data source 330 for various values and data. Responsive to<br>
a request for a report, via the requesting computer 320 for example, the report server 300<br><br>
9<br>
generates a report, as described below. Also shown is a report authoring / design tool 325 which<br>
is used to create report definitions, as described herein.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary method of report processing and generation in<br>
accordance with the present invention. It is contemplated that dependencies are determined as a<br>
pre-processing step. Specifically, if an individual report parameter's default value and/or allowed<br>
values cannot be immediately evaluated, a Jist of its dependencies is determined. This results in<br>
a tree structure indicating the dependencies for parameter input. For example, assume that there<br>
are three parameters defined for a report, Parameter!, Parameter2, and Parameters. Parameter's<br>
set of valid values are based on a query that uses the value of Parameter 1. Parameter's default<br>
value is based on a query that uses the value of Parameter1. Thus, when the parameter metadata<br>
is retrieved for the report, it would indicate that both Parameter1 and Parameter3 are dependent<br>
on Parameterl.<br>
A report server begins processing, at step 400. At step 400. the appropriate report<br>
definition (described below, with respect to Figure 5, for example) is retrieved from storage or<br>
otherwise generated, including parameters, data sets, and data sources. Parameter metadata is<br>
then evaluated at step 410. This metadata comprises such information as the allowed values and<br>
default value of the parameters, along with any values that the user has provided, as described<br>
below.<br>
If all of the parameters have values, at step 415, then the report is executed at step 495.<br>
Otherwise, parameters with no unresolved dependencies on other parameters are selected, at step<br>
420 for further processing. Parameters without any unresolved dependencies are processed to<br>
retrieve their allowed values and default values for presentation to the user for prompting. In this<br>
manner, a value retrieved or specified by the user for a parameter may be used to generate the set<br>
of the allowed values or default value of parameters later in the sequence. Thus, the set of<br>
allowed values and default value for a parameter is dynamically provided to the user, allowing a<br>
more efficient and precise process.<br>
At step 425, a parameter that does not have any unresolved dependencies is selected. It is<br>
determined at step 430 if there is a query for the allowed values for the parameter. If so, then the<br>
allowed values are retrieved at step 435 using an external data source 450. Thus, with respect to<br>
the example above, if the parameter "state" is dependent on the parameter "region" for which the<br>
user had previously selected "northwest", then the allowed values retrieved at step 435 are states<br><br>
10<br>
that are in the northwest region of the United States. These states will then preferably be<br>
provided to the user in a dropdown list, for example, as a prompt to choose the values to be used<br>
during report generation.<br>
If there is no query specified for the allowed values at step 430, or after the allowed<br>
values are retrieved, then at step 440, it is determined if there is a query for default value. If so,<br>
then the default is retrieved at step 445 from the external data source 450. If not, or after the<br>
default value has been retrieved, then at step 460, it is determined if there are any additional<br>
parameters remaining that have no unresolved dependencies, from step 420. If there are<br>
additional parameters remaining, then processing continues at step 425, with the next parameter<br>
being processed.<br>
After all of the parameters that do not have any unresolved dependencies have been<br>
processed, the user is prompted for value(s) at step 470 (e.g., the user makes his selection from<br>
the dropdown lists provided responsive to the retrieved allowed values and/or default values,<br>
such as, in keeping with the example above, the user chooses a state from the states presented in<br>
the dropdown list of the states in the northwest region), and processing continues at step 410<br>
with additional parameters being retrieved and subsequently processed as set forth above. In this<br>
manner, the user is presented with a series of dropdown (or other types of) lists from which he is<br>
to make selections of values to be used in the subsequent report generation. The dropdown lists<br>
present a targeted subset of all choices, that subset containing the only prospective user<br>
responses (e.g., if the user had specified states in the northwest region of the United States, he<br>
will only then be presented with a dropdown list of states in the northwest region, and not a list<br>
of all the states in the United States; those states in the northwest region are considered to be the<br>
targeted subset of all choices).<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram of an exemplary report definition in accordance with the present<br>
invention. A report 500 ultimately comprises metadata, such as name, description, author, and<br>
page width and height. The report is generated pursuant to report parameters 505 and data sets<br>
540 based on query parameters 570, described further below. Each report parameter can<br>
optionally specify a default value 510 and set of valid values 520. The default value 510 can<br>
either be specified through a stored, constant value 515 or derived via a data set reference 530.<br>
Similarly, the valid values 520 can either be a set of stored, constant parameter values 525 or<br>
derived via a data set reference 530.<br><br>
11<br>
The data set 540 is generated pursuant to a query 550 and a data model 560. The query<br>
550 comprises query parameters 570, along with the data model 560 which comprises various<br>
fields 580. The data set reference 530 comprises references to fields in a data set. The values of<br>
these fields are used as the default value (in the case of a default value with a data set reference)<br>
or as the value/label pairs (in the case of valid values with a data set reference).<br>
Parameters are specified in the report definition. Parameter types include report<br>
parameters 505 and query parameters 570. A report parameter 505 is a value supplied to a report<br>
500 (or contained within a report definition) that enables the report to show a different aspect of<br>
the data. A report parameter is typically used to provide values to query parameters. Additional<br>
uses of report parameters include post-query filtering and modification of the report appearance<br>
depending on expressions used in the report.<br>
A query parameter 570 is a value supplied to a query 550 or stored procedure in a data<br>
processor that is used to return its results. The capabilities of query parameters are typically<br>
defined by the data processor (e.g., the data processor 315). Query parameters can be set to any<br>
allowable expression, including fixed values or expressions based on report parameters 505.<br>
Query parameters are preferably passed to the data processor through the APIs that the<br>
data processor supports. After the query parameter expression is evaluated, the result is<br>
converted to the appropriate data type and then passed to the data processor. Query parameter<br>
syntax is preferably dependent on the data processor used. For example, SQL Server can use a<br>
question mark character in a SELECT statement such as "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES<br>
WHERE LEVEL = ?". It can also use parameters defined directly in a stored procedure (e.g.,<br>
"EXECUTE GetEmployee @EmployeeIDParm").<br>

TABLE 1<br>
Figure 6 is a tree diagram that is useful in describing how exemplary control(s) are<br>
presented to a user for each report parameter associated with a report. A value based on a query<br>
is determined by the presence of the dependencies sub-element combined with the absence of the<br>
value sub-element in a parameter element. For the value sub-element, at step 600, it is<br>
determined whether its value is based on a query, hard-coded, or not specified. If the value is<br>
based on a query, then it is noted that the control is query based and an appropriate message is<br>
displayed, for example, at step 605. If the value is hard-coded or not specified, then the type<br>
sub-element value is determined, at step 610. If the type is Boolean, then "true" and "false"<br>
indicators (e.g., radio buttons) are provided or otherwise displayed, at step 615. Otherwise, if the<br><br>
13<br>
type is DateTime, double, integer, or string, for example, it is determined whether valid values<br>
are provided, at step 620.<br>
If valid values are not provided, then it is determined at step 625 whether the<br>
dependencies sub-element is provided. If not. then if there are multiple values, at step 640,<br>
multi-line edit control is provided at step 655. If multiple values are not present at step 640, then<br>
single-line edit control is provided at step 650. If the dependencies sub-element is present at step<br>
625, then dropdown list control is provided at step 635. Similarly, if valid values are provided at<br>
step 620, then dropdown list control is provided at step 630. With respect to the dropdown list<br>
control, if there are multiple values present, then the dropdown list is preferably multi-selection;<br>
otherwise the dropdown list is preferably single select.<br>
Figure 7 is a tree diagram that is useful in describing how an exemplary control is<br>
initialized and its default value for each report parameter associated with a report. Controls are<br>
initialized based on a number of conditions. Conditions include if there exists a valid value list<br>
and value, is there is a valid value, etc. Note that this initialization tree is typically applicable to<br>
parameters that are not derived from a query or user based. At step 700, it is determined whether<br>
a ValidValues sub-element is present. If not, the Value sub-element is determined, at step 740.<br>
If the value of the Value sub-element is hard-coded, then that value is displayed, at step 745. If<br>
the Value of the value sub-element is not specified, then it is determined whether the type sub-<br>
element is DateTime, at step 750. If so, then the current date and time is displayed, at step 755;<br>
otherwise, a blank is provided, at step 760.<br>
If the ValidValues sub-element is present at step 700, then the control is populated with<br>
the valid values, at step 705. At step 710, the Value sub-element value is retrieved, and if the<br>
value is not specified, then a blank is provided, at step 715. If the value from step 710 is hard-<br>
coded, then it is determined at step 720 whether the value is in a previously defined or generated<br>
control list. If so, the value or values are selected, at step 730; otherwise, a blank is displayed, at<br>
step 725.<br>
When a value for a report parameter is prompted for, the control (which may be HTML<br>
control) that is used for setting the value is based on a number of conditions. Conditions include<br>
where the default value is coming from, the parameter data type, if NULL is an acceptable value,<br>
if a predefined list of valid values exists, etc. The control(s) that are presented to the user for<br><br>
14<br>
each report parameter associated with a report based on these conditions are preferably generated<br>
as set forth in Figure 6 beginning at step 610, as described herein.<br>
Figure 8 is a tree diagram that is useful in describing how exemplary control(s) are<br>
presented to the user for each report parameter associated with a report based on conditions.<br>
Controls are initialized based on a number of conditions. Conditions include if there exists a<br>
valid value list and value, if there is a valid value, etc. Figure 8 defines how a control is<br>
initialized and its default value for each report parameter associated with a report based these<br>
conditions. In some cases, it is contemplated that the value of the value sub-element may be<br>
NULL.<br>
At step 800, it is determined whether or not a ValidValues sub-element is present. If the<br>
ValidValues sub-element is not present, then at step 850, it is determined whether a Value sub-<br>
element is present. If the Value sub-element is not present, then a blank is provided, at step 855.<br>
If the Value sub-element is present, it is then determined, £t step 860, if the value of the Value<br>
sub-element is hard-coded. If so, then that value is displayed, at step 865. If the value of the<br>
value sub-element is not specified, then it is determined whether the type sub-element is<br>
DataTime, at step 870. If so, then the current date and time is displayed, at step 875; otherwise, a<br>
blank is provided, at step 880.<br>
If a ValidValues sub-element is present at step 800, then the control is populated with the<br>
valid values, at step 805. At step 810, the Value sub-element value is retrieved, and if the value<br>
is not present, then a blank is provided, at step 815. If the value from step 810 is present, it is<br>
then determined, at step 820, if the value of the Value sub-element is hard-coded or not<br>
specified. If the value is not specified, then a blank is provided, at step 825. If the value of the<br>
Value sub-element is hard-coded, then it is determined at step 830 whether the value is in a<br>
previously defined or generated control list. If so, the value or values are selected, at step 840;<br>
otherwise, a blank is displayed, at step 835.<br>
