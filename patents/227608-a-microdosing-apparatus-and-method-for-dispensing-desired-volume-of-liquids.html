				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a microdosing apparatus,<br>
to methods for dosed dispensing of liquids and to methods<br>
tor adjusting a desired dosing volume range when using an<br>
incentive microdos ing apparatus.<br>
According to the prior art, volumes in the nanoliter range<br>
require specific methods to ensure the required precision.<br>
Here, in addition to contact methods, conventional<br>
dispensing methods, pin printing methods, etc., contactless<br>
methods are of significant importance.<br>
A class of known methods is based on fast-switching valves.<br>
Therefore, a suitable valve, mostly based on magnetic or<br>
piezoelectrical drives, is connected to a media reservoir<br>
via a conduit and pressure is built up in the same. By the<br>
than 1 ms, a very large flow is generated for a short term,<br>
so that the fluid, even with high surface tensions, can<br>
separate from the dispensing position and can impinge on<br>
the substrate as free jet. The closing amount can be<br>
controlled by the pressure and/or the switchinq time of the<br>
valve.<br>
Different approaches exist for generating the pressure,<br>
there are in the above-described concept with switched<br>
valves.<br>
A schematic representation showing a first known approach,<br>
which can be referred to as syringe solenoid method, is<br><br>
shown in Fig. 7. Here, a fluid conduit 10 is fluidically<br>
connected to a syringe 14, which can be removable, via a<br>
fast-switching microsolenoid valve 12. At the lower end of<br>
the syringe 14, there is a nozzle opening 16. The opposite<br>
end of the fluid conduit 10 is connected to a syringe pump<br>
20 via a switching valve 18. Further, a fluid reservoir 22<br>
is also connected to the switching valve 18 via a further<br>
f1uid conduit 24.<br>
The switching valve 18 has two switching states. In a first<br>
switching state, a pump chamber 26 of the syringe pump 20<br>
is fluidically connected to the fluid reservoir 22 via the<br>
fluid conduit 24, so that liquid 28 can be drawn from the<br>
fluid reservoir into the pump chamber 26, by increasing the<br>
volume of the pump chamber 26 by a corresponding movement<br>
of the piston 30 of the syringe pump. This process serves<br>
process, the switching valve 13 is switched to effect a<br>
fluidic connection of the pump chamber 2 6 to the<br>
microsolenoid valve 12 via the fluid conduit 10. By using<br>
the piston 30, pressure is applied to the liquid inside the<br>
pump chamber 26, so that by fast switching the<br>
microsolenoid valve 12 switching time 1 mi, liquid can<br>
Dosing apparatuses of the type shown in Fig. 7 are, for<br>
example, sold by the company Cartesian.<br>
An alternative principle, as is practiced, for example, by<br>
the companies Delo and Vermes, is shown in Fig. 8. In this<br>
alternative method, a pressure container 40 is provided,<br>
containing liquid 42 under pressure. An outlet of the<br>
pressure container 40 is connected to a quickly switchable<br>
valve 46 via a fluid conduit 44, which is again connected<br>
to a nozzle opening, shown merely schematically as arrow in<br>
Fig. 8, via a fluid conduit 48. In this arrangement, liquid<br>
can also be dispensed in a free jet from the nozzle opening<br>
by fast switching of the valve 46.<br><br>
described in DE.-A- 1 9-02 36" , DF-A-19802368 and EP-A-0725267.<br>
The microdOSinq apparatuses described there comprise a pump<br>
chamber abutting to a flexible membrane and connected to a<br>
reservoir "ia a supply line and to a nozzle opening via a<br>
drain. An example for such a microdosing apparatus will be<br>
discussed below with reference to Figs. 9a - 9c.<br>
microdosing apparatus in the resting position is shown. The<br>
dosing apparatus comprises a dosing head 50 and an<br>
actuating 'device 52. In the shown example, the dosing head<br>
50 is formed by two interconnected substrates 54, 56, in<br>
which respective recesses are formed. The first substrate<br>
5-1 is structured such that a reservoir connection 58, an<br>
inlet channel 60 and a dosing chamber 62 are formed in the<br>
same. The lower substrate 56 is structured such that a<br>
nozzle connection 6-1, a nozzle 66 having a nozzle channel<br>
and an outlet opening, and an outlet area 68 having a<br>
significantly larger cross section than the outlet opening<br>
Further, a membrane 64 is formed the upper substrate 54 by<br>
the structuring of the same.<br>
The actuating device 52 has a displacer 72, by which the<br>
membrane can be deflected downwards to reduce the volume<br>
of the dosing chamber 62, as shown in Fig. 9b. By this<br>
reduction oi the volume or the dosing chamber z, on the<br>
one hand, a backflow 74 results through the inlet channel<br>
60 and the reservoir connection 58. On the other hand, a<br>
forward flow results through the nozzle connection 64 and<br>
the nozzle 66, so that dispensing liquid 76 takes place at<br>
the outlet end of the nozzle 66. The ratio between backflow<br>
74 and dosed liquid 76 depends on the ratio of flow<br>
resistance of fluid connection between reservoir and dosing<br>
chamber to the flow resistance between dosing chamber and<br>
outlet opening of the nozzle 66.<br><br>
Alter the dosing process, the displacer 72 is moved upwards<br>
by using the actuating device 52, see Fig. 9c, so that the<br>
same finally resumes its original position by elasticity,<br>
as shown in Fig. 9a. By this resetting of the membrane 70,<br>
an increase of the volume of the dosing chamber 62 results,<br>
so that a refill flow 78 from the reservoir through the<br>
reservoir connection 58 and the inlet channel 60 occurs. In<br>
order to avoid an intake of air through the nozzle 66<br>
during this phase, resetting the membrane 70 has to be<br>
performed slowly enough, so that capillary forces keeping<br>
the liquid in nozzle 66 are not overcome thereby.<br>
Microdosing apparatuses as described above with reference<br>
to Figs. 9a - 9c have originally been developed for enzyme<br>
dosage in biochemistry. By using these apparatuses, liquids<br>
with viscosities up to 100 mPas in a volume range of 1 nL<br>
to 1000 nL can be dosed very media independent and<br>
precisely. The liquid to be dosed is thereby dosed by<br>
displacing a dosing chip, preferably made of silicon, in<br>
free jet from the dosing chamber, which is. However, this<br>
method requires a comparatively complex micro device.<br>
Finally, a droplet ejection system is known from U.S<br>
3,683,212, wherein a tube shaped piezoconverter connects a<br>
fluid conduit to a nozzle plate wherein a nozzle opening is<br>
formed. A voltage pulse with short rise time is applied to<br>
the converter to effect contraction of the converter. The<br>
resulting sudden decrease of the enclosed volume causes a<br>
small amount of fluid to be ejected from the opening in the<br>
opening plate. Thereby, the liquid is kept under no or no<br>
low pressure. The surface tension at the opening prevents<br>
that liquid flows out when the converter is not operated.<br>
The ejected liquid is replaced by a capillary forward flow<br>
of liquid in the conduit.<br>
It has been found out that according to US- 3 , 683,212, the<br>
drop is generated with the help of an acoustic principle<br><br>
similar to the piezoelectric inkjet methods. Here, an<br>
acoustic pressure wave is generated in a rigid fluid<br>
conduit, for example a rigid glass capillary, which results<br>
in a high pressure gradient locally at an output position,<br>
which leads to drop separation. The actuating time of the<br>
actuator iS here in the range of the sound propagation in<br>
the system, which is normally several microseconds. Thus,<br>
in this context, the acoustic impedance of the fluid<br>
conduits below and above the actuator is of significance<br>
for the design. Thus, this is an impulse method where a<br>
high acoustic impulse is generated with a low volume<br>
displacement. In other words, a sound wave with pressure<br>
maxima and pressure minima is generated between the<br>
actuation position and the disposing position, wherein<br>
ejection of liquid is effected at the dispensing position<br>
by a corresponding pressure. According to US 3,683,212, the<br>
fluid conduct is only negligibly deformed, the actuator<br>
mainly only transmits sound and the elasticity of the fluid<br>
conduit has no significant importance.<br>
From DE 4 313 C2, an apparatus for dosing liquids is<br>
known, having a liquid supply tube connected if one end<br>
a liquid reservoir and open at the other end. The tube is<br>
applied to an abutment socket and a hammer is provided on<br>
the side opposing the abutment socket of the tube. The<br>
hammer can vibrated periodically in a direction transversal<br>
to the tube axis, so that the whole tube cross section is<br>
crimped by the hammer, i.e. the flow area is substantially<br>
brought to zero. Therebv, impulsive force impact's are<br>
exerted on the tube and individual liquid drops are driven<br>
out of the open end.<br>
Tt is the ohiect of the present invention to provide a<br>
microdosing apparatus with a simple structure, which<br>
further preferably allows an easy change of a dosing volume<br>
to be dispensed. It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method for dosed dispensing of<br>
liquids.<br><br>
This object is achieved by microdosing apparatuses<br>
according to claims 1 and 9 and a method according to claim<br>
20, 29 and 30 .<br>
The present nvention provides a microdosing apparatus<br>
comprising:<br>
a fluid conduit having a flexible tube, preferably a<br>
polymer tube, with a first end for connecting to a liquid<br>
reservoir and a second end where an output opening is<br>
located; and<br>
an actuating device having a displacer with adjustable hub,<br>
by which the volume of a portion of the flexible tube can<br>
be changed, to thereby dispense liquid as free flying<br>
droplets or as free flying jet at the outlet opening by<br>
moving the displacer between the first end position and the<br>
second end position, wherein the tube is partly compressed<br>
at least in the first end position or the second end<br>
position.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a microdosing<br>
apparatus, comprising:<br>
reservoir and a second end where an outlet opening is<br>
located, the fluid conduit having a portion along which a<br>
cross section of the fluid conduit can be varied to effect<br>
a change of the volume of the fluid conduit;<br>
portion of the fluid conduit for effecting a change of the<br>
volume oi the fluid conduit to thereby dispense liquid as<br>
free flyiny droplets or free flying jet from the outlet<br>
opening;<br><br>
wherein a ratio of the fluidic impedance between the<br>
position of the actuating device and the outlet opening to<br>
a fluidic impedance between the fluid reservoir and the<br>
position of the actuating device is variable by changing<br>
the position of the actuating device, so that a dosing<br>
volume dispensed at the outlet opening is variable by at<br>
least 10<br>
Here, impedance means the combination oi fluidic<br>
resistance and fluidic inductance determined by the length<br>
and the flow cross section of a line.<br>
Thus, the present application allows adjusting of the<br>
dosing volume either by adjusting the hub of the actuating<br>
device acid or adjusting the position of the actuating<br>
device along a fluid conduit whose volume can be changed.<br>
Such a vara ability of the ratio of the mentioned flow<br>
resistances can be preferably achieved by designing the<br>
fluid conduit between fluid reservoir and ejection opening<br>
with a substantially linear structure, i.e. the same has a<br>
cross section without erratic cross section changes between<br>
fluid and ejection opening. In the simplest case,<br>
this can be achieved by a fluid conduit having a<br>
substantially constant cross section between fluid<br>
reservoir and ejection opening in the resting position.<br>
The present invention requires no fine-mechanical or<br>
microstructured members as required in other drop<br>
reduced and the operation security is increased. Further,<br>
the fluid carrying part can be produced as disposable<br>
members, simply of plastics, for example polyimide, whereby<br>
an expensive cleaning 'when changing media is omitted.<br>
Further, according to the invention, no limited pressure-<br>
chamber is used tor generating pressure, but a variable<br>
"active area". Thereby, optimization possibilities result<br><br>
for fluids by varying the displacer position,<br>
i.e. the position of the actuating device along the portion<br>
of the fluid conduit along which the cross section of the<br>
fluid conduit can be varied to effect a change of the<br>
volume of the fluid conduit. By an axially asymmetric<br>
volume change, a preferred direction of a fluid flow can be<br>
generated in the fluid conduit in the direction of the<br>
outlet opening. Further, a simple change of the maximum<br>
dosing volume can be caused by increasing the "active<br>
area", for example by using a larger displacer, wherein<br>
such change of the maximum dosing volume does not require<br>
construction changes at the fluid carrying parts. Finally,<br>
a potential pressure difference between input opening and<br>
output opening can be explicitly provided to ensure a<br>
preferred direction during refill or to avoid leaking of<br>
the liquid from the outlet opening. Thus, media that cannot<br>
be moved by capillary forces in the fluid conduit can also<br>
be dosed.<br>
Further, the present invention provide; a method for<br>
dispensing of liquids, comprising the steps of:<br>
filling a fluid conduit having a flexible tube, preferably<br>
a polymer tube, with a liquid to be dosed;<br>
effecting a volume change of a portion of the flexible tube<br>
by a displacer with adjustable hub, to thereby dispense<br>
liquid as free flying droplets or as free flying jet at an<br>
outlet opening of the fluid conduit by moving the displacer<br>
between a first end position and a second end position,<br>
wherein the tube is partly compressed at least, in the first<br>
end position or the second end position.<br>
Further, the present invention provides methods for<br>
adjusting	a desired dosing volume in a dosing process by<br>
using an	inventive microdosing apparatus, comprising the<br>
step of:<br><br>
disposing the actuating device at a predetermined position<br>
along the portion of the fluid conduit, so that due to the<br>
effecting a change of the volume of the fluid conduit, a<br>
desired dosing volume can be dispensed at the outlet<br>
opening.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a method for<br>
adjusting a desired dosing volume in a dosing process by<br>
using an inventive microdosing apparatus, comprising the<br>
step of:<br>
selecting a displacer with an axial length with regard to<br>
the portion of the fluid conduit, which is adapted to allow<br>
dispensing of a desired dosing volume in a step of<br>
effecting a change of the volume of the fluid conduit.<br>
Thus, the fire sent invention allows additional degrees of<br>
freedom when adjusting a desired dosing volume. On the one<br>
hand, with a predetermined hub and thus a predetermined<br>
displacement of the actuating device, a desired dosing<br>
volume can be adjusted by the above-described steps. If the<br>
hub and thus the displacement of the actuating device are<br>
adjustable, a desired dosing volume range can be adjusted<br>
by the above-mentioned steps, wherein then the dosing<br>
volume lying within the desired dosing volume range can be<br>
adjusted by adjusting the hub or the displacement of the<br>
actuating device, respectively.<br>
A characteristic property and a significant advantage of<br>
volume displacer systems, as they are realized by the<br>
present invention, is that in the same the dosing volume is<br>
largely independent of the viscosity of the liquid to be<br>
dosed.<br>
Above that, according to the present invention, the<br>
actuating device can be designed together with the fluid<br>
conduit to allow a full crimping of the fluid conduit by<br><br>
the dispiacer as an extreme case of volume displacement. In<br>
that case, additionally, a valve function can be<br>
implemented. The possibility of fully interrupting the<br>
fluid conduit between reservoir and dispensing position can<br>
thus represent a further advantage compared to known<br>
methods.<br>
In contrast to the teachings of US-3,682, 212, in the<br>
inventive microdosing apparatuses, a continuous pressure<br>
gradient is built up across the whole fluid conduit,<br>
wherein the fluid is actually pushed out of the conduit<br>
starting from the displacer. The whole fluid between<br>
displacer and outlet opening is moved in direction of the<br>
outlet opening. Acoustic phenomena play no part, since the<br>
volume displacement is performed on a time scale of a few<br>
milliseconds significantly slower than with impulse<br>
methods.<br>

With regard to the schematic representations in Figs, la to<br>
1c, the essential features of the present invention as well<br>
as: the concept underlying the same will be discussed below.<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus or a method,<br>
respectively, for generating microdrops or microjets,<br>
respectively, mainly in the nanoliter to picoliter range. A<br>
fluid carrying conduct is a central element of an inventive<br>
microdosing apparatus, whose inlet opening is connected to<br>
a liquid reservoir, in which the media to be dosed is<br>
located, on the other end of the conduit is an cutlet<br>
opening through which the liquid to be dosed can be<br>
dispensed. The fluid carrying conduit is preferably mainly,<br>
made of an elastic material, so that the volume of the<br>
conduit between inlet opening and outlet opening can be<br>
varied by deforming the conduit, for example compressing<br>
the same.<br>
The essential elements of an inventive dosing apparatus<br>
during different phases of a dosing process are shown in<br>
Figs, 1a t o 1c.<br>
As shown in Fig. la, a fluid conduit 100, which is an<br>
elastic polymer tube in preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, comprises an inlet-side end 102, which<br>
serves for connecting to a fluid reservoir, and an outlet-<br>
side end where microdrops or microjets, respectively,<br><br>
can be dispensed. The outlet-side end 104 can thus also be<br>
referred to as nozzle. Respective walls 106 of the elastic<br>
polymer tube 100 are illustrated in Figs. la to 1c by<br>
dotted lines.<br>
An actuator 108 in form of a displacer is provided, which<br>
has a connection part 110 where the displacer 108 can be<br>
attached to an actuating member for driving the displacer<br>
108 .<br>
In the shown embodiment, the elastic polymer tube has a<br>
substantially constant cross section, which will normally<br>
be circular, from its input end 102 to its output end 104.<br>
In such a microdosing apparatus, an area 112 disposed below<br>
the displacer 108 can be referred to as dosing chamber<br>
area, which is defined by the position of the displacer 108<br>
with regard to the elastic polymer tube 100. An area 114<br>
beginning substantially at the right end of the displacer<br>
108 represents an outlet channel fiuidicaily connecting the<br>
displacer area 112 to the outlet end 104. An area 116,<br>
which is illustrated in the figures in a reduced form and<br>
extends from the left end of the displacer 108 towards the<br>
left, represents an input channel fiuidicaily connecting<br>
the displacer area 112 to the input end 102.<br>
As further shown in Fig. la, the displacer 108 can comprise<br>
a displacer surface 120 running diagonally to the wall 106<br>
of the polymer tube 100, which allow generation of a<br>
preferred direction of a fluid flow in direction towards<br>
the outlet opening 104 by an axially asymmetric volume<br>
change during operation of the microdosing apparatus.<br>
In the following, the mode of operation of the inventive<br>
microdosing apparatus will be discussed.<br><br>
When switching on the dosing system, the fluid conduit 100<br>
will be filled automatically either by an externally<br>
generated pressure difference or by capillary forces.<br>
An externally generated pressure difference can, for<br>
example, be applied by using a fluid reservoir wherein the<br>
fluid is put under pressure .<br>
When applying a static pressure positive with regard to the<br>
outlet end coverpressure, it has to be considered that the<br>
pressure by which the liquid in the conduit 100 is<br>
provided, is not higher than the capillar forces be which<br>
the liquid is kept in the conduit, since otherwise leaking<br>
of liquid would occur from the output end 104 in the non-<br>
operated state of the microdosing apparatus.<br>
Alternatively, pressure negative with regard to the output<br>
end underpressure can be applied to avoid leaking of<br>
liquid from the output end in the non-operated state if the<br>
capillary torces are too weak. This opposing pressure has<br>
to be overcome by the capillary forces during refill.<br>
At the begining of a dosing process, in a first phase,<br>
which can be referred to as dosing phase, liquid is<br>
displaced from the conduit by reducing the conduit volume<br>
between inlet opening and outlet opening. This is achieved<br>
by moving the displacer 108 downwards, i.e. in direction<br>
towards the polymer tube 100, so that a compression of the<br>
polymer tube occurs in the displacer area 112. This<br>
downward movement is illustrated in Fig. lb by arrows 122.<br>
Thus, the displacer area 112 represents the active area of<br>
the invention microdosing apparatus .<br>
The liquid displaced from the conduit due to this volume<br>
change of the fluid conduit 100 is pressed out of the ends<br>
of the conduit or stored at another position by changing<br>
the conduit cross section when the conduit has a fluidic<br>
capacity.<br><br>
By the volume change of the fluid conduction 100 caused by<br>
a fast movement 122 of the displace: 108, on the one hand,<br>
a fluid flow towards the outlet, opening 104 takes place, as<br>
indicated by an arrow 124. On the other hand, a backflow<br>
into the fluid reservoir through the input channel 116<br>
takes place, as indicated by an arrow 126. By the forward<br>
flow 124, a fluid ejection in the form of a microdrop or a<br>
microjet, respectively, takes place at the outlet opening<br>
104 .<br>
Which portion of the fluid will be dispensed through the<br>
outlet opening 104 as jet or drop, respectively, depends on<br>
the position, type and dynamic of the volume change. As has<br>
already been mentioned above, a preferred direction of the<br>
current in the direction towards the outlet opening 104 can<br>
be affected by an axiaiiy asymmetrical volume change as<br>
caused by the displacer 103 and particularly the displacer<br>
surface 120. For generating a jet or a drop dispensed in<br>
the dosing phase at the outlet end 104, the volume change<br>
occurs sufficiently fast to transfer the required impulse<br>
to the fluid drop or fluid jet, respectively, so that the<br>
same can separate from the outlet opening 104. Thereby,<br>
both the fluid properties, such as density, viscosity,<br>
surface tension and the same, as well as a pressure<br>
difference that can exist between inlet opening and outlet<br>
opening play an important part. Further, the fiuidic<br>
resistances bet; ween outlet opening 104 and the active area<br>
112, where in the volume change is performed i.e. the<br>
fluidic impedance of the outlet channel 114 as well as the<br>
fluidic impedance of the conduit part between active area<br>
14 and inlet opening 112 ie. the fiuidic impedance of the<br>
inlet channel 116 i are determining for the ratio between<br>
dispensed dosing amount forward flow 124 and the fluid<br>
amount fed back into the reservoir backflow 126. A good<br>
dosing quality can, for example, be achieved when the<br>
volume change is performed close to the outlet opening<br><br>
104 with high dynamic for example 50 nL within one<br>
Ey positioning the displacer close to the outlet opening<br>
be effected that the fiuidic impedance of the<br>
outlet channel 114 is low compared to the fiuidic impedance<br>
of the inlet channel 116, so that a large part of the<br>
displaced fluid is ejected from the outlet opening 104.<br>
Thereby, it can be said that the displacer is disposed<br>
close to the outlet opening 104 when the length of the<br>
inlet channel 116 is at least twice the size of the length<br>
of the outlet; channel 114, preferably at least five times<br>
as large and more preferred at least ten times as large.<br>
After the fluid drop or fluid jet, respectively,<br>
in a second phase, which can roe referred to as refill<br>
phase, the volume between inlet opening 102 and outlet<br>
opening 104 is increased again. This is achieved by moving<br>
the displacer 108 away from the fluid conduit 100 in the<br>
direction of an arrow 132, as shown in Fig. 1c. Due to this<br>
volume change, liquid flows from the reservoir through the<br>
inlet opening 102 and the inlet channel 116 into the<br>
conduit and particularly into the active area 112 of the<br>
same, as indicated in Fig. lc by arrow 134. The drawing in<br>
of air through the outlet opening 104 is prevented through<br>
capillary forces, with correspondingly small conduit cross<br>
from the reservoir can Lee determined by a hydrostatic<br>
pressure difference between inlet opening and outlet<br>
opening. For this purpose, the fluid reservoir could, for<br>
example, again be provided with pressure.<br>
At the end of the refill phase, again, the situation shown<br>
in Fig. la is present, wherein then a dosing process can be<br>
preformed again.<br>
Figs. 2a to 2d show a drop generator using an inventive<br>
microdosing apparatus with respective mounts for the fluid<br><br>
conduit or the actuator, respectively. Fig. 2a shows a side<br>
view of the drop generator, while 2b shows a bottom view of<br>
the same. Fig. 2c shows a sectional view along line P.-A of<br>
Fig. 2b, while Fig. ?d illustrates an enlargement of<br>
portion in the scale 5:1.<br>
The drop generator shown in Figs. 2a to 2d comprises a<br>
polyimide tube 150, which can have, for example, an inner<br>
diameter of 200 µm. For storing the polyimide tube 150, a<br>
storage block 152 and an abutment block 154 are provided. A<br>
guide groove is provided in the storage block 152 and or<br>
the abutment block 154, wherein the polyimide tube is<br>
inserted, so that the polyimide tube is securely stored<br>
between storage block and abutment block in a stabilized<br>
way. The storage block 152 and the abutment block 154 are,<br>
for example, attached to a mounting portion 160 of a mount<br>
162 by using mounting screws 156. Further, the mount formed to hold a displacer 164 on the side of the polyimide<br>
tube 150 opposing the abutment 154, with the help of which<br>
the tube can be compressed in the active area of the same,<br>
whereby the invention volume change between inlet opening<br>
and outlet opening is obtained. Thereby, the dispiacer is<br>
driven by a piezostack actuator mot shown, whose<br>
displacement can be electronically controlled, and which is<br>
connected to the dispiacer 164 via an adapter 166. In order-<br>
to effect a preferred direction of a drop ejection 168 by<br>
the outlet opening or the polyimide tube 150, the dispiacer<br>
164 again has a displacing surface, which is diagonal in<br>
relation to the polyimide tube, i.e. running in an angle to<br>
the same.<br>
Further, the mount 162 comprises a receiver 170 tor the<br>
driving unit. in the form of the piezostack actuator.<br>
Further, the mount 162 can have a recess 172 penetrating<br>
the same to allow attaching the same at a device, which<br>
also includes the drive unit, for example by using a screw<br>
joint.<br><br>
With regard to the structure shown in Figs. 2 a to 2d, a<br>
prototype has been build and successfu11y experimentailly<br>
tested. Fig. 3 shows different phases of a dosing process<br>
performed with the prototype, wherein the polyimide tube<br>
150 is shown with its outlet end 180 in each case.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the dispensed mass in microgram with a number<br>
of 1800 dosing processes by using the prototype, wherein<br>
water has been used as liquid to be dosed. The medium drop<br>
mass was 21.57 µg, with a standard deviation a of 0.35 µg.<br>
The polyimide tube had a diameter of 200 urn. The<br>
gravimetric measurement of the reproducibility illustrated<br>
in Fig. 4 proves that a precision at least corresponding to<br>
the one of conventional dosing apparatuses and even<br>
superior to the same can be obtained with the inventive<br>
concept.<br>
With regard to Figs. 5a, 5b, 6a and 6b, it will be<br>
discussed below how a desired dosing volume or a desired<br>
dosing volume range, respectively, can be adjusted in an<br>
inventive microdosing apparatus.<br>
In Figs. 5a and 5b, the polymer tube 100 is shown<br>
schematically, whose inlet opening 102 is fluidically<br>
connected to a liquid reservoir 200 and whose outlet end<br>
104 represents an ejection opening. The active area 112 as<br>
well as the outlet channel 114 and the inlet channel 116<br>
are defined by the position of the displacer 108. In the<br>
arrangement shown in Fig. 5a, the input channel 116 and the<br>
outlet channel 114 have substantially the same lengths xi<br>
and so that the fluidic impedance of the same is<br>
substantially identical, when a constant cross section of<br>
the tube 100 is assumed. Thus, in the shown form of the<br>
displacer 106, which effects no preferred flow direction,<br>
a volume displacement effected by the displacer 108' would<br>
cause that flows of the same size would flow in the<br>
direction of the outlet opening 104 and the inlet opening<br>
102. Thus, when neglecting the fluid capacity of the tube<br><br>
conduit 100, the volume ejected by the outlet opening 104<br>
would be half as much as the volume displacement caused by<br>
According to Fig. 5b, the displacer 108' is disposed close<br>
to the outlet opening 104. In other words, the length of<br>
the inlet channel 116 is about five times as large as the<br>
length of the outlet channel x-. Thus, with a constant<br>
cross section of the tube 100, the fluidic impedance of the<br>
inlet channel 116 is five times as high as the one of the<br>
outlet channel 114, so that a much higher portion of the<br>
volume change effected by the displacer 103' effects a flow<br>
in the direction of the outlet opening 104 and thus an<br>
ejection through the same.<br>
In the above-mentioned way, a desired dosing volume can be<br>
adjusted by changing the position of the displacer relative<br>
to the conduit 100. Further, if the drive means of<br>
the displacer allows a selective adjusting of the hub of<br>
the same, i.e. a selective adjustment of the movement of<br>
the same by different distances vertically to the fluid<br>
conduit, so that the displacer can effect different volume<br>
changes in the dependence on its control, the above<br>
adjustment of the position can represent an adjustment of a<br>
desireo volume range, while the final adjusting of<br>
the desired dosing volume in the adjusted dosing volume<br>
range is performed by a corresponding control of the<br>
displacer.<br>
According to the invention, the dosing volume dispensed at<br>
the out Lot opening is adjustable by changing the position<br>
of the displacer, as long as the ratio of the flow<br>
resistances from inlet channel and outlet channel can be<br>
significantly changed by changing the position of the<br>
displacer. Here, significantly should mean a change which<br>
causes a change of a dosing volume dispensed at the outlet<br>
opening by at least 10, whereby the actual adjustment<br>
range with depend on across which range the position of the<br><br>
displace r can be adjusted. Thereby, by using the irventive<br>
microelosina apparatuses, changes of the dispensed dosing<br>
can be realized by changing the<br>
positive the displacer. This inventive adjustability of<br>
the ratio of the flow resistances of inlet channel and<br>
outlet channel is preferably enabled according to the<br>
invention in that no erratic cross section changes occur-<br>
between dosing chamber, i.e. active area, and inlet channel<br>
or outlet channel, respectively. In even more preferred<br>
embodiment;-: ot the present invention, the cross section or<br>
the fluid conduit is constant from the segment of<br>
displacement, i.e. the active area, to the outlet opening<br>
in the resting position. Further, in preferred embodiments,<br>
the whole fluid conduit between fluid reservoir and outlet<br>
opening has a substantially constant cross section.<br>
A second possibility, how a desired dosing volume or a<br>
desired dosing volume range, respectively, can be adjusted<br>
according to the invention, can be taken from E igs . 6a and<br>
6b. According to Fig. 6a, the displacer 108' has a length<br>
along the tube 100, while according to Fig. 6b, a<br>
displacer 208 has a length along the tube 100. The<br>
length 1_ is longer than the length so that the<br>
displacer 208 allows a larger volume change of the fluid<br>
conduit 100 with the same hub. Thus, according to the<br>
indention, by changing the length of the displacer along<br>
the fluia conduit with constant hub, a desired dosing<br>
volume, or similar to the above discussions, a desired<br>
dosing volume range can be adjusted.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a microdosing<br>
apparatus having a fluid conduit filled with a medium to be<br>
dosed, whose one end can be connected to a fluid reservoir<br>
and at whose other end an outlet opening is located, as<br>
segment of the fluid conduit can be temporally changed, so<br>
that through the volume change, fluid is dispensed as free<br>
flying droplets or as free flying jet at the outlet<br><br>
opening. According to the invention, the whole fluid<br>
conduit can be formed by a flexible polymer tube.<br>
Alternatively, only the mentioned determined segment can be<br>
formed by a flexible polymer tube, while feed and drain<br>
from this segment are formed by a rigid fluid conduit.<br>
As explained above, according to the invention, the<br>
displacement occurs at an elastic segment of the fluid<br>
conduit. Preferably, the elastic segment can resume the<br>
starting position in the fluid conduit, for example the<br>
flexible polymer tube or the membrane, respectively, after<br>
operation automatically, so that the displacer does not<br>
have to be connected to the fluid conduit in a fixed way,<br>
so that the fluid conduit can be designed as a simple<br>
disposable member.<br>
The present invention also comprises drop generators,<br>
wherein several inventive microdosing apparatuses are<br>
disposed in parallel. Such microdosing apparatuses disposed<br>
in parallel can be controlled separately, to dose different<br>
liquids or the same liquids. Alternatively, the drop<br>
generator can have several fluid conduits, which can be<br>
controlled simultaneously by a displacer, so that the same •<br>
or different liquids can be dosed by the same. For that<br>
purpose, the inlet ends of the different fluid conduits can<br>
be connected to the same or different liquid reservoirs.<br><br>
Thus, an inventive microdosing apparatus can consist of one<br>
or several microdrop generators, each having a relastic<br>
fluidic conduit filled with a medium to be dosed, whose one<br>
end has an inlet opening connected to a fluid reservoir and<br>
whose other end has an outlet opening, wherein a pressure<br>
differenc can exist between inlet opening find<br>
opening, and an actuating device by which the volume of the<br>
conduit between fluid reservoir and outlet opening can be<br>
temporally changed, wherein during a first phase the<br>
fluidic volume between inlet opening and outlet opening is<br>
reduced with sufficient speed from its initial volume to a<br>
smaller volume, whereby a microdrop or a microjet,<br>
respectively, is ejected through the outlet opening and<br>
part of the displaced volume can leak out to the inlet<br>
opening, wherein the volume of the microdrop or microjet,<br>
respectively, plus the volume receding into the reservoir<br>
through the inlet opening substantially corresponds to the<br>
volume change caused by the actuating device, and in a<br>
second phase, wherein the volume between inlet opening and<br>
outlet opening is increased again, the fluid conduit is<br>
again fi I led from the reservoir driven by pressure or<br>
capillary forces .<br>
Apart from the mount described with reference to Figs. 2a<br>
to 2d an automatic mount can be provided, which allows<br>
automatic adjustment of the position of the displacer to<br>
the fluid conduct, for example in response to a signal<br>
indicating dosing volume range or a desired<br>
dosing volume, respectively.<br>
By using the inventive microdosing apparatuses, thus,<br>
individual free flying microdroplets are generated<br>
preferabl'.' at an outlet openinq in contact with the<br>
surrounding atmosphere, to dispense fluid as free living<br>
droplets or free flying jet at the outlet opening. Thereby,<br>
the present invention allows ejecting of a droplet already<br>
with a single operating cycle of the actuating device,<br><br>
volume of the fluid conduit to thereby eject the droplet.<br>
The present invention allows adjusting the dosing volume by<br>
adjusting the hub of the actuating device and/or disposing<br>
the actuating device at a predetermined position along the<br>
adapted axial length can be chosen.<br>
When using an adjustable hub for adjusting the dosing<br>
volume, the hub h of the actuating de-vice or the displacer,<br>
respectively, is variable and smaller than the diameter of<br>
the tube, i.e. the cross section dimension of the same in<br>
actuating device.<br>
In the case where the whole tube cross section is crimped,<br>
i.e. the flow area is substantially brought to zero, as<br>
required in DE 4.31434 3 C2, the drop volume is determined by<br>
tube diameter. By crimping the tube, the whole volume<br>
within the relevant tube portion is displaced.<br>
Approximately, for the displaced volume which then<br>
significantly determines the drop volume with otherwise<br>
equal arrangement- the following applies:<br><br>
Here, 7 represents the displaced volume, a the length of<br>
the displacer and d the diameter of the tube.<br>
Compared with this, in a displacer with adjustable hub, the<br>
role. Here, the displaced volume depends on the hub h and<br>
can be approximately be described by the volume of a<br>
laterally trimmed cylinder:<br><br><br>
Here, h is the distance by which the tube is compressed.<br>
by this dependence the displaced volume on hub h and<br>
its described effect on the drop volume, the present<br>
invention allows a variable adjustment of the dosing volume<br>
without having to connect a tube with different diameter or<br>
a displacer with different dimensions, respectively.<br>
According to the invention, there is a connection between<br>
volume displacement and drop generation or drop volume,<br>
respectively, in a single dosing process, so that the<br>
present invention allows dosing with a non-periodic<br>
excitation. This is advantageous, for example, when<br>
specific non-periodic patterns are to be printed on 3<br>
In the above-described embodiments, the actuating device is<br>
designed to effect an actuation of the tube starting from<br>
are possible where the tube is partly or fully crimped,<br>
i.e. compressed, in standby mode. A schematic cross section<br>
representation of such an embodiment is shown in Fig. 10a.<br>
The tube 100 is applied to a counter mount 300 at its<br>
backside. On the opposing side of the tube 100, a<br>
piezoactuator 301' is mounted to a mount 302 of an actuating<br>
device. A displacer 306 is disposed at the front end of the<br>
piezoactuator 302 .<br>
In the arrangement shown in Fig. 10a, the tube 100 is fully<br>
crimped in the standby mode. The dosing cycle starts with<br>
slowly pulling back the plezoactuator 302, so that the<br>
cross section of the tube 100 is partly freed. During this<br>
phase, fluid flows from the reservoir, to which the tube<br>
100 is connected at the end 102 opposing the outlet opening<br><br>
104, in the previously crimped area, in order to compensate<br>
the increasing tube volume. The actual dosing process with<br>
the drop formation at the outlet end 104 is then performed<br>
by quickly extending the piezoactuator 302 to decrease the<br>
tube volume again. As in the above-described embodiments,<br>
the dosed volume is defined by the adjustment travel of the<br>
piezoactuator 302 and can thus be controlled by varying the<br>
operating voltage or by the variation of the charging<br>
current or discharge current at the piezoactuator 302,<br>
respectively. It is an advantage of the configuration shown<br>
in Fig. l0a that the crimped tube has a significantly lower<br>
evaporation rate of dosed material compared to the normally<br>
open tube.<br>
Thus, this embodiment contains an integrated closing<br>
mechanism. However, it is a disadvantage that in<br>
commercially available conventional piezostack actuators<br>
the extended state of the piezoactuator is that state where<br>
the electric voltage is applied. When taking away the<br>
electric voltage, the piezostack actuator becomes shorter,<br>
the reduced state. Accordingly, this means that the<br>
embodiment of an integrated closing mechanism snown in Fig.<br>
10a effects a continuous but slight energy consumption. In<br>
order to fully use the advantages of the integrated closing<br>
mechanism, it is advantageous in the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 10a to apply an electrical voltage continuously or to<br>
dosing system is not used.<br>
An integrated closing mechanism with reduced energy<br>
consumption can be implemented by providing the actuating<br>
device with a biasing means, for example a spring, pressing<br>
the displacer against the polymer tube in order to achieve<br>
partial or full crimping of the tube in the standby mode.<br>
Then, the actuating device preferably has an actuator,<br>
which is disposed to move the displacer against the force<br>
of the biasing means and to release the tube cross section<br>
partly or fully.<br><br>
An embodiment tor such an integrated closing mechanism is<br>
shown in Fict. 10b. Again, the tube 100 is applied against a<br>
counter mount 310. In this embodiment, an actuating device<br>
comprises combination of a sprinq 312 and a piezostack<br>
actuator 31-1. Further, the actuating device comprises a<br>
displacer 31c, which is rigidly coupled to an actuating<br>
plate 318. In Fig. 10b, two couplings rods 320 and 322 are<br>
shown as exemplary coupling means. The spring 312 is<br>
presses the displacer 316 against tube 100 to crimp the<br>
same in the non-operated state of the actuator 31-1. This<br>
embodiment allows the realization of a dosing apparatus<br>
whose tube is crimped with switched off electrical supply<br>
voltage, so that the same has an integrated closing<br>
mechanism without continuous energy consumption.<br>
In the off state, the displacer 316 is pressed on<br>
to the tube 100 by the spring such that the same is pressed<br>
onto the counter mount 310 and crimped. If a dosing process<br>
is to be performed, the piezoactuator 314 is extended by<br>
applying an electrical voltage, and thus the displacer 316<br>
is reset against the sprinq force. The tube relaxes and the<br>
liquid to be dosed flows in from the reservoir connected to<br>
the side 102 of the tube opposed to the outlet opening 10-J.<br>
By quickly driving back the piezostack actuator 318, the<br>
tube 100 is again crimped via the spring 312, which is<br>
dimensioned in a sufficiently strong way. The spring is<br>
dimensioned rigidly enough so that liquid is dispensed from<br>
the outlet opening 10-1 as free flying jet. The dosed volume<br>
is again defined by the adjustment travel of the<br>
piezoactuator and can thus be controlled be varying the<br>
operating voltage or by varying the charging or discharge<br>
current in the piezostack actuator, respectively.<br>
Here, it should be noted that embodiments discussed with<br>
regard to FIGS. 10a and 10b also function when the tube is<br>
not fully.<br><br>
In the embed i mentis of the present invention, where the<br>
dosing volume is adjusted via the adjustable hub of the<br>
displacer or the actuating device, respectively, the<br>
displacer is moved between a first end position and the<br>
second end position, wherein the polymer tube is partly<br>
compressed in the first end position and the second end<br>
position. Thereby, the first end position defines a larger<br>
tube volume than the second end position, so that by moving<br>
the displacer from the first end position, into the second<br>
end position liquid is dosed out of the ejection end.<br>
Thereby, the first end position can define a fully relaxed<br>
state of the tube or a partly compressed state of the same.<br>
The second end position can comprise a partly compressed<br>
state or a fully compressed state of the polymer tube, in<br>
other words, in the inventive embodiments, where the dosing<br>
volume is adjustable by an adjustable hub of the actuating<br>
device, the tube wall is moved by the actuating device or<br>
by the dispiacer, respectively, 'via a part of the light<br>
cross section of the flexible polymer tube. In contrary,<br>
when fully crimping the tube from a non-crimped state to a<br>
fully crimped state, the tube wall is moved across the<br>
whole light cross section of the tube.<br>
The embodiments shown in Figs. 10a and 10b can also be<br>
implemented such that the position of the actuating device<br>
can be varied to thereby be able to vary the dosing volume<br>
dispensed from the cutlet opening.<br><br>
