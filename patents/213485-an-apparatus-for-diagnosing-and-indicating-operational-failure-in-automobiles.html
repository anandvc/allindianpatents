				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for diagnosing and indicating operational failure in automobiles, and more particularly, to an apparatus for diagnosing and indicating operational failure in automobiles which diagnoses operational failure of electric parts and circuits in automobiles, analyses the result of the diagnosis and accurately informs a driver of the location where the operational failure occurred.<br>
Description of the Related Art	<br>
When an abnormal situation occurs during operation of an automobile, that is, when a car malfunctions, safe driving is seriously jeopardized. However, most drivers have little knowledge on vehicle maintenance and are not capable of appropriately coping with such an abnormal situation. For example, when sudden operational failure or functional deterioration occurs during operation of an automobile, most drivers are usually confused and safe driving is jeopardized. Further, they tend to forget even to think about directly and methodically finding the functional failure and repairing it. Even to experienced driver, it may take much time to directly find and repair a functional failure.<br>
Basic car maintenance that can be directly handled by a driver are listed in detail in a car maintenance manual. Nevertheless, when an automobile gets malfunctions while a driver is driving, it is not easy to refer to the manual and find the problem.<br>
In the case of mechanical malfunction, even a driver having car maintenance knowledge may not easily find the cause of the problem. If he/she succeeds in finding the cause of the problem, it is not easy to fix the problem when spare parts and tools to remedy the cause of malfunction are not provided.<br>
Also, in the case of electrical malfunction, even if a driver having considerable knowledge on car maintenance can easily cope with a problem by checking fuses or relays in the automobile, most common drivers are not able to handle the problem as they have little knowledge thereof. In particular, when a fuse in a fuse box of an automobile is burnt out, most drivers, if he/she succeeds in finding the fuse box, have difficulties in finding out which one of many various colored fuses is in not working.<br>
A fuse is generally used to protect electrical devices or electric circuits from being damaged due to an overload. In a complex apparatus such as common automobiles or industrial equipments where many fuses and wiring are needed, an additional fuse box is provided to<br><br>
integrally manage the fuses and wiring. In the case of an automobile, color fuses are used to jndicate use of each fuse in the fuse box and a semitransparent fuse is used to easily indicate broken fuses. For general drivers who are not aware of such information, it is very difficult to check the disconnection of a fuse by pulling every fuse out of a fuse box. Also, as the space in the fuse box is very small and since it is usually dark around the fuse box, even replacement of a fuse in the fuse box is not an easy task. Furthermore, for a sealed part such as a relay used for an automobile, it is nearly impossible for drivers to find a defective relay and pull it out. When an automobile is driven with such a defective fuse or a relay, a part of or all parts of the automobile such as the dash board, various lamps, the windshield wiper, the air conditioner, the audio component, the lighter, the defroster, etc., do not work properly, causing inconvenience during driving and even accidents.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the description below, elements performing the same functions are designated with the same reference numerals.<br>
When an overload occurs due to malfunction of en electrical device in an automobile, current and voltages change and excess current and voltage may flow to the electrical device through electric wiring. Thus, resistance heat is generated at the electric parts and wiring so that they can be damaged. To protect the electric parts and wiring from an overheated state, a fuse is used to protect the electric parts and wiring from being damaged due to the overheated state so that the fuse is disconnected before the electric parts and wiring are damaged. Also, various kinds of relays are used for various motors or control circuits used for automobiles. Whether electric devices in automobiles function normally can be checked by checking the state of these relays like the fuse. Thus, in the present invention, whether the electric devices used for automobiles function normally is diagnosed and indicated by detecting changes in voltage at both ends of the fuse or relay.<br>

FIG. 18 is a power circuit diagram in which an additional independent power source is connected to the fuse so that the diagnostic circuit of the present invention can operate in a state in which an automobile is not started. In FIG. 18, an additional power circuit is connected so that the diagnostic circuit 20 of the present invention operate even when the power switch 31 installed at a pressing end of the fuse 10 is turned off. The power circuit is provided with an independent power VCC 181 and an independent ground BGND 182. The ground 182 performs a floating ground role separately from the existing ground AGND 180 to prevent reverse current by diodes Da and Db without affecting the existing power source and diagnose changes in voltage at both ends of the fuse. The diagnostic circuit 20 is connected to points PI and P2. Thus, even if a voltage is not applied to the fuse 10 from the main power +12V, the diagnostic circuit 20 is operated. When the automobile is not started, slight current flows the fuse 10 due to the independent fuse power supply circuit. As the current is very low, resistors Ra and Rb are designed to disregard the current. Thus, when the automobile is not started and the fuse 10 is disconnected, the diagnostic circuit 10 can recognize that the fuse 10 is disconnected.<br>
In the description above, the apparatus for diagnosing and indicating operational failure in automobiles according to the present invention can be manufactured not only in a built-in type but also a cartridge type or external box type so that it may be easily applied to nearly all types of automobiles.
