Among these sixteen crystal forms, two isomorphic families are identified.   Family I<br>
includes forms F, G, H, J, M, N, 0, and P. Family II includes forms C, D, E and R. Form Q is<br>
distinct from families / and U. The forms within a family are isomorphs that crystallize in the<br>
same space group with slight variation of cell parameters and comprise chemically related<br>
structures but different elemental composition. In this case, the variation in chemical<br>
composition among the isomorphs arises from incorporation of different water/solvent<br>
molecules.   Consequently, the isomorphs display similar but non-identical X-ray diffraction<br>
patterns and- solid-state NMR-spectra- (ssNMR).   Other-techniques such as near infrared<br>
spectroscopy (NIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gas chromatography (GC),<br>
thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA),  or thenmalgravimetric analysis/infrared spectroscopy<br>
analysis (TG-IR), Karl Fischer water analysis (KF) and molecular modeling/visualization<br>
provide   data   for   affirmative   identification   of   isomorphs.	Dehydration/desolvation<br>
temperatures were determined by DSC with a heating rate of 5*C/min<br>
Form C: This crystal form was identified from a single crystal structure (Table 2) - a monohydrate of azithromycin. It has the space group of P2,2,2i and similar cell parameters as that of forms D and E; therefore, it belongs to Family II isomorphs. Its calculated powder pattern is similar to that of forms D and E.<br>
Form D: Form D was crystallized from cyclohexane. The single crystal structure of form D shows a stoichiometry of a monohydrale/monocyclohexane solvate of azithromycin (Table 3). Cyclohexane molecules were found to be disordered in the crystal lattice. From single crystal data, the calculated water and cyclohexane content of form D is 2.1 and 9.9%. respectively. Both the powder pattern and the calculated powder pattern of form D are similar to those of forms C and E. The powder samples of form D showed a desotvation/dehydration endotherm with an onset temperature of about 87°C and a broad endotherm between 200* 280"C (decomposition) in DSC analysis at 5°CAnin from 30-300*C.<br>
Form D to prepared by slurrying azithromycin in cyclohexane for 2-4 days. The solid fcym D azithromycin is colected by filtration and dried.<br>
Form E: Form E was obtained as » single crystal coOected in a THF/water medium. It it a monohydrate and mono-THF sorvale by single crystal analysis (Table 4). By Ms sngie crystal structure, the calculated PXRO pattern is similar to that of form C and form D making It • fam#y II isomorph.<br>
Form E it prepared by dissolving azithromycin in THF (telrahydrofuran). Diffusing water vapor lo saturated azithromycin THF solution over time yields crystals of Form E.<br><br>
I<br><br>
Form F: The single crystal of form F crystallized in a monoclinic space group. P2,, with the asymmetric unit containing two azithromycin, two waters, and one ethanol, as a monohydrate/hemi-ethanolate (Table 5).   It is isomorphic to forms all family I azithromycin crystalline forms. The calculated PXRD pattern of this form is similar to those of other family I isomorphs. The theoretical water and ethanol contents are 2.3 and 2.9%, respectively.  The powder samples show a dehydration/desolvation endotherm at an  onset temperature between 110-125CC. Form F is prepared by dissolving azithromycin in ethanol (1-3 volumes by weight) at a temperature of about 50-70°C. Upon complete dissolution, the solution is cooled to subambient temperature to cause precipitation. The volume of ethanol can be reduced by vacuum distillation with stirring for 1-2 hours to increase the yield. Alternatively, water (optionally chilled to 0-20°C) about 0.1-2 volume can be added with collection of solids within 30 minute after water addition. Cooling the ethanol solution of azithromycin prior to the addition of water to below below 20"C, preferably below 15*C. more preferably below 10, and most preferably 5"C results in substantially pure azithromycin form F.   The solid form F azithromycin is collected by filtration and dried.<br>
Form G: The single crystal structure of form G consists of two azithromycin molecules and three water molecules per asymmetric unit (Table 6). This corresponds to a sesquihydrate with a theoretical water content of 3.5%. The water content of powder samples of form G ranges from about 2.5 to about 6%. The total residual organic solvent is less than 1% of the corresponding solvent used for crystallization, which is well below stoichiometric quantities of solvate. This form dehydrates with an onset temperature of about 110 -120°C.<br>
Form G may be prepared by adding azithromycin to a premixed organic solvent/water mixture (1/1 by volume), where the organic solvent can be methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol or isopropanol. The mixture is stirred and heated to an elevated temperature, e.g. 45-55*C for 4-6 hours to cause dissolution. Precipitation occurs during cooling to ambient temperature. The solid form G azithromycin is collected by filtration and dried.<br>
Form H: This crystal form is a monohydratememi-propytene glycol solvate of azithromycin free base (Table 7). It was isolated from a formulation solution containing propylene grycoi. The crystal structure of form H is isomorphic to crystal forms of Famty I.<br>
Azithromycin form H is prepared by dissolving azithromycin dfrydrate in 6 volumes of propylene glycol. To the resulting propylene glycol solution of azithromycin, 2 volumes of water is added and precipitation occum. The slurry b stirred for 24 hours and the solids are fttered and air-dried at ambient temperature to afford crystalline Form H.<br>
Form J: Form J is a rronoftydreteifternr n-propanot solvate (Table 8). The calculated solvent content is about 3.8% n-propanol and about 2.3% water. The experimental data shows from about 2.5 to about 4.0% n-propanol and from about 2.5 to about 3% water intent for powder samples. Its PXRD pattern is very simlar to those of its isomorphs F, G.<br><br>
H, M and N. Like F and G, the powder samples have a dehydration/desolvation endotherm at 115- 125°C.<br>
Form J is prepared by dissolving azithromycin in 4 volumes of n-propanol at a temperature of about 25-55cC Water, about 6-7 volumes, is added at room temperature and the slurry is continuously stirred for 0.5-2 hours. The solid form J azithromycin is collected by filtration and dried.<br>
Form K: The PXRD pattern of form K was found in a mixture of azithromycin form A and microcrystalline wax after annealing at 95°C for 3 hours. It is a lower hydrate of form A and is a metastable high temperature form.<br>
Form L: This form has only been observed upon heating the dihydrate; form A. In variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD) experiments, a new powder X-ray diffraction pattern appears when form A is heated to about 90°C. The new form, designated form L, is a lower hydrate of form A because form A loses about 2.5 weight % at 90 °C by TGA, thus corresponding to a conversion to a monohydrate. When cooled to ambient temperature, form L rapidly reverts to form A.<br>
Form M: Isolated from an isopropanol/water slurry, form M incorporates both water and isopropano/. lis PXRD pattern and ss-NMR spectrum are very similar to those of Family I isomorphs,.indicatingihal_itJ5elangsJo_Farriily.I.. By analogy.to the known crystal structures of Family I isomorphs, the single crystal structure of form M would be a monohydrate/hemi-isopropranolate. The dehydration/desolvation temperature of form M is about 115-125°C.<br>
Form M may be prepared by dissolving azithromycin in 2-3 volumes of isopropanol (IPA) at 40-50°C. The solution is cooled to below 15°C. preferably below 10°C, more preferably about 5°C and 2-4 volumes of cold water about 5°C are added to effect precipitation. Seeds of form M crystals may be added at the onset of crystallization. The slurry is stirred less than about 5 hours, preferably less than about 3 hours, more preferably less than about 1 hour and most preferably about 30 minutes or less and the solids are collected by filtration. The solids may be reslumed In isopropanol. This procedure provides form M substantially in the absence of azithromycin dihydrate.<br>
Form N: Isolated from water/ethanot/isopropanoi slurry of form A, form N crystals may contain variable amounts of the crystallization solvents and water. Its water content varies from about 3.4 to about 5.3 weight percent Analysis by GC Headspace reveals a variable servant content of ethano! and isopropanol. The total solvent content of form N sample* b usuafty lower than about 5% depending on the conditions of preparation and dryrtg. The PXRD pattern of form N is similar to that of forms F, G, H, J and M of the Famly I bomorphs. The derrydration/desotvation endotherm(s) of the samples of form N may be broader and may vary between 110-130°C.<br><br>
Form N azithromycin may be prepared by recrystallizing azithromycin from a mixture of azithromycin crystal latice-incorporating organic solvents and water, such as ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, acetone, acetonitirile etc. The solvent mixture is heated to 45-60°C and azithromycin is added to the heated solvent mixture, up to a total of about 4 volumes. ") Upon dissolution, 1-3 volumes of water are added with continuous agitation at 45-60°C. Form N azithromycin precipitates as a white solid. The slurry is allowed to cool to ambient i      temperature with stirring. Solid form N azithromycin is isolated by filtration and dried.<br>
Form O: This crystal form is a hemihydrale hemi-n-butanol solvate of azithromycin free base by single crystal structural data (Table 8A). It was isolated from n-butanol solution of azithromycin with diffusion of antisolvent. The crystal structure of form O is isomorphic to<br>
crystal forms of Family I	<br>
Azithromycin is completely dissolved in n-butanol. Addition of an antisolvent, such as hexane, water, IPE or other non-solvent, by diffusion results in precipitation of Form O.<br>
Form P: This is a proposed crystal form, being a hemihydrale hemi-n-pentanol solvate of azithromycin free base. It can be isolated from an n-pentanol solution of azithromycin with diffusion of an antisolvent. The crystal structure of form P is isomorphic to crystal forms of Family I.<br>
Form P of azithromycin may be prepared as following: Azithromycin is completely dissolved in n-pentanol; addition of an antisolvent, such as hexane, water, isopropyl ether (IPE) or other non-solvent, by diffusion results in precipitation of Form P.<br>
Form Q: The crystal form of Q exhibits a unique powder X-ray diffraction pattern. It contains about 4% water and about 4.5% THF, being a hydrate hemi THF solvate. The main dehydration/desolvation temperature is from about 80 to about 110°C.<br>
Azithromycin dihydrale is dissolved in 6 volumes of THF and 2 volumes of water are added. The solution is allowed to evaporate to dryness at ambient conditions to afford orystaline Form Q.<br>
Form R: This crystalline form is prepared by adding amorphous azithromycin to 2.5 volumes of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE). The resulting thick while suspension is stirred 3 days at ambient conditions. Solids are collected by vacuum filtration and air dried. The resuffog buk azithromycin form R has a theoretical water content of 2.1 weight % and a tfieoretical methyl tort-butyl ether content of 10.3 weight %.<br>
Due to the simlarity in the* structures, bomorphs have propensty to form a mixture of the forms within a famly, sometimes termed as "mixed crystals" or "crystalline solid solution". Form N is such a solid crystalline solution and was found to be a mixture of Famly I jsomorphs by solvent composition and solid-state NMR data.<br><br>
I<br><br>
Both Family I and Family II isomorphs are hydrates and/or solvates of azithromycin. The solvent molecules in the cavities have tendency to exchange between solvent and water under specific conditions. Therefore, the solvent/water content of the isomorphs may vary to a certain extent.<br>
The crystal forms of isomorphic Family I are more stable than form A when subjected to heating. Forms F, G, H, J, M and N showed higher onset dehydration temperatures at 110-125 °C than that of form A with an onset dehydration temperature at about 90 to about 110°C and simultaneous solid-state conversion to form L at about 90°C.<br>
Amorphous azithromycin: All crystal forms of azithromycin contain water or solvent(s) or both water and solvent(s). When water and solvent(s) are removed from the crystalline solids, azithromycin becomes amorphous. Amorphous solids have advantages of high initial dissolution rates.<br>
The starting material for the synthesis of the various crystal forms in the examples below was azithromycin dihydrate unless otherwise noted. Other forms of azithromycin such as amorphous azithromycin or other non-dihydrate crystalline forms of azithromycin may be used.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Form D<br>
Form D was prepared by slurrying azithromycin dihydrate in cyclohexane for 2-4 days at an elevated temperature, e.g. 25-50°C. The crystalline solids of form O were collected by filtration and dried.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of Form F<br>
2A" Azithromycin dihydrate was slowly added to one volume of warm ethanol, about 70°C. and stirred to complete dissolution at 65 to 70°C. Seeds of Form F 1- 2% wt may be introduced to facilitate the crystallization. The solution was allowed to cool gradually to 2 -5°C and one volume of chilled water was added The crystalline solids were collected shortly (preferably less than 30 minutes) after addition of water by vacuum filtration.<br>
2B: Azithromycin dftydrate b slowly added to one volume of warm ethanol, about 70*C. and stirred to complete dissolution at 65 to 70°C. Seeds of Form F 1- 2% wt may be produced to facilitate the crystallization. The solution is allowed to cool graduaffy to 2 - 5*C and ethanol volume may be reduced by vacuum d"atHatjon. After stirring up to 2 hours the cry»trtne solids are collected by vacuum Rtration. The isolation of the crystals yields substantia^ pure form F azithromycin, form F azithromycin substantiaty free of form G azithromycin and form F azJtriromycin substantially free of azithromycin dihydrate.<br><br>
Example 3: Preparation of Form G<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with form A azithromycin.  In a separate vessel, 1.5<br>
volumes methanol and 1.5 volumes water were mixed. The solvent mixture was added to the<br>
reaction vessel containing the form A azithromycin.  The slurry was stirred with heating to<br>
50°C for approximately 5 hours. Heating was discontinued and the slurry was allowed to cool<br>
with stirring to ambient temperature. The form G azithromycin was collected by filtration and<br>
allowed to air dry for approximately 30 minutes.   The collected form G azithromycin was<br>
further dried in a vacuum oven at 45°C.  This procedure yields substantially pure form G<br>
azithromycin, and form G azithromycin substantially free of azithromycin dihydrate.<br>
Example 4: Preparation of Form J<br>
Form J was prepared by dissolving azithromycin in 4-volumes ofn-propanol at a temperature of about 25°C. Water (6.7 volumes) was added and the slurry is continuously stirred for 1 hour, followed by cooling to about 0°C. The solid form J azithromycin was collected by filtration and dried.<br>
Example 5: Preparation of Form M Substantially in the Absence of Azithromycin Dihydrate<br>
5A; Azithromycin dihydrate is completely dissolved in 2 volumes of warm isopropanol 40 - 50°C. Seeds of Form M may be optionally introduced to facilitate the crystallization. The solution is then cooled to 0-5°C and 4 volumes of chilled water as antisolvent are added and the solids are collected by vacuum nitration. The solids are reslurried in 1 volume of isopropanol for 3-5 hours at 40-45 °C and then cooled to 0-5°C. The crystalline solids are collected shortly (about 15 minutes) after addition of water by vacuum nitration. The solids are reslurried in 0.5 to 1 volume of isopropanol at 25-40°C and cooled to about 5°C followed by filtration to collect solids of form M.<br>
5B: Azithromycin dihydrate (1940 grams) was completely dissolved in 2 volumes of warm isopropanol (45°C). The resulting dear solution was filtered through an inline 0.2 um filter into a dean flask. The temperature was maintained at 45°C and the solution was seeded with form M crystals. 7.6 L of chiled water was added over B minutes. The solution was cooled to 5*C and a thick slurry was noted. The solids were isolated by vacuum filtration and transferred to a dean flask. The crystalline azithromycin was slurried in 1 volume of isopropanol alcohol with warming to 35*C. The slurry was then cooled to 5*C for 30 minutes and the solid crystaline material was Altered off.<br>
These procedures yield substantiaty pure form M azithromycin, form U azithromycin substantiaty free of form G azithromycin and form M azitriromycin substantiaty free of ezithf omyoin cWiydrate<br>
Example 6: Preparation of Form N<br><br>
Two volumes of ethanol and 2 volumes of isopropanol were added to a reaction vessel and heated to 50°C. Azithromycin form A was added with stirring to the heated ethanol/isopropanol mixture to yield a clear solution. The reaction vessel was charged with 2 volumes distilled water (ambient temperature). Stirring was continued at 50°C and solid form N azithromycin precipitated after approximately 1 hr. Heating was discontinued 5 hours after the addition of the water. The slurry was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Precipitated form N azithromycin was collected by filtration and dried for 4 hours in vacuum oven at 45°C.<br>
Example 7: Preparation of amorphous azithromycin<br>
Crystalline form A azithromycin was heated to 110-120°C in an oven for overnight under vacuum. The amorphous solids were collected and stored with desiccant as needed. Example 8: Preparation of Form H<br>
Azithromycin dihydrate or other crystal forms was dissolved in 6 volumes  of propylene glycol.  To the resulting propylene glycol solution of azithromycin, 2 volumes of water were added and precipitation occurred.   The slurry was stirred for 24 hours and the solids were filtered and air-dried at ambient temperature to afford crystalline Form H. Example 9: Preparation of Form Q<br>
The crystalline powder was prepared by dissolving 500 mg azithromycin Form A in 2 ml THF. To the clear, colorless solution at room temperature was added 1 ml water. When the solution became cloudy an additional 1ml THF was added to dissolve the azithromycin completely, and the solution was stirred at ambient temperature. Solvent was allowed to evaporate over 7 days, after which the dry solids were collected and characterized.<br>
Example 10: Powder X-ray diffraction analysis<br>
Powder patterns were collected using a Bruker D5000 diffractometer (Madison, Wisconsin) equipped with copper radiation, fixed slits (1.0. 1.0. 0.6mm). and a Kevex solid state detector.

Example 11: Single crystal X-ray analysis	&gt;<br>
Data were collected at room temperature using Bruker X-ray diffractometers equipped with copper radiation and graphite monochrome tors. Structures were solved using direct methods. The SHELXTL computer library provided by Bruker AXS, Inc facilitated all necessary crystallographic computations and molecular displays (SHELXTL™ Reference Manual. Version 5.1. Bruker AXS. Madison. Wisconsin. USA (1997)).<br>
Example 12: Calculation of PXRD pattern from single crystal data<br>
To compare the results between a single crystal and a powder sample, a calculated powder pattern can be obtained from single crystal results. The XFOG and XPOW computer prograrm provided as part of the SHELXTL computer library were used to perform Into calculation. Comparing the calculated powder pattern with the experimental powder partem confirms whether a powder sample corresponds to an assigned sngle crystal structure (Table 9A). This procedure was performed on the crystal forms of azithromycin A, D. F. G. and J.<br>
The calculated PXRD diffraction pattern of azithromycin form A is given In figure 1.<br>
Th# calculated PXRD diffraction partem of azithromycin form D is given in flour* 5.<br>
The calculated PXRD diffraction pattern of azithromycin form F Is given In figure 9.<br>
The calculated PXRD diffraction pattern of azithromycin form G to given in figure 12.<br>
The calculated PXRD diffraction pattern of azithromycin form J b gtven In figure 15.<br><br>
The results are displayed in the overlaid powder X-ray diffraction patterns for forms A, D, F, G, and J in figures 3, 7, 11, 14 and 17, respectively. The lower pattern corresponds to the calculated powder pattern (from single crystal results) and the upper pattern corresponds to a representative experimental powder pattern. A match between the two patterns indicated the agreement between powder sample and the corresponding single crystal structure.<br>

Example 13: Solid Stale NMR Anarysb<br>
Solid Slate NMR analysis:<br>
Al "C solid stale NMR spectra were collected on an 11.75 T spectrometer (Bruker Btospln, Inc., BUerica. MA), corresponding to 125 MHz iaC frequency. The spectra were collected using a cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe operating at<br><br>
ambient temperature and pressure. Depending on the quantity of sample analyzed, 7 mm BL or 4 mm BL Bruker probes were employed, accomodating 300 mg and 75 mg of sample with maximum speeds of 7 kHz and 15 kHz. respectively.    Data were processed with an exponential line broadening function of 5.0 Hz.   Proton decoupling of 65 kHz and 100 kHz were used with the 7mm and A mm probes, respectively. A sufficient number of acquisitions were averaged out to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratios for all peaks.   Typically, 600 scans were acquired with recycle delay of 3.0 s, corresponding approximately to a 30 minute total acquisition time.   Magic angle was adjusted using KBr powder according to standard NMR vendor practices. The spectra were referenced relative to either the methyl resonace of hexamethylbenzen (HMB) at 17.3 ppm or the upfield resonance of adamantane (ADM) at 29.5 ppm.   HMB referenced spectra show chemical shifts of all peaks shifted down field by 0.08 ppm with respect to same spectra referenced to ADM. The spectral window minimally included the spectra region from 190 to 0 ppm. The results are summarized in Table 10. Ss-NMR spectra for forms M, H and R were referenced to ADM, Ss-NMR spectra for forms A, D, G, F, J and N were referenced to HMB. Forms H and R were spun at a rate of 15 kHz.<br>

Example 15: Antimicrobial activity:<br>
The activity of the crystal forms of the present invention against bacterial and protozoa pathogens is demonstrated by the compound"s ability to inhibit growth of defined<br>
		-   -	_<br>
strains of human (Assay I) or animal (Assays II and III) pathogens.<br>
Assay I<br>
Assay I, described below, employs conventional methodology and interpretation<br>
criteria and is designed to provide direction for chemical modifications that may lead to<br>
compounds that circumvent defined mechanisms of macroiide resistance. In Assay I, a panel<br>
of bacterial strains is assembled to include a variety of target pathogenic species, including<br>
representatives of macroiide resistance mechanisms that have been characterized.   Use of<br>
this panel enables the chemical structure/activity relationship to be determined with respect to<br>
potency, spectrum of activity, and structural elements or modifications that may be necessary<br>
to obviate resistance mechanisms.   Bacterial pathogens that comprise the screening panel<br>
i     are shown in the table below.  In many cases, both the macrolide-susceptible parent strain<br>
and the macrolide-resistant strain derived from it are available to provide a more accurate<br>
assessment of the compound"s ability to circumvent the resistance mechanism. Strains that<br>
contain the gene with the designation of ermA/ermB/ermC are resistant to macrolides,<br>
mcosamides. and streptogramin B antibiotics due to modifications (methytation) of 235 rRNA<br>
molecules by an Enm methytase. thereby generally prevent the binding of afl three structural<br>
classes. Two types of macroiide efflux have been described; msrA encodes a component of<br>
an efflux system In staphylococci that prevents the entry of macrolides and streptogramins<br>
whle mtfAJE encodes a fransmembnane protein that appears to efflux only macrolides.<br>
hactivstion of macroiide  antibiotics can  occur  and  can  be  mediated  by  either a<br>
prtosphoryiation of the 7-ftydroxy! (mph) or by cleavage of the macrocydk: lactone (esterase).<br>
The strains may be characterized using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
technology and/or by sequencing the resistance determinant The use of PCR technology In<br>
-3o -<br><br>
this application Is described in J. Sutdiffe et al., "Detection Of Erythromycin-Resistant Determinants By PCR", Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 40(11), 2562*2566 (1996). The assay Is performed in microtiler trays and interpreted according to Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests - Sixth Edition; Approved Standard. published by The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is used to compare strains. The crystalline compound is initially dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as 40 mg/ml stock solution.<br>

P. muttodda (strain 59A067) is inoculated into 5 ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. The test<br>
compound is prepared by solubilizing 1 mg of the compound in 125 jil of dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO).   Dilutions of the test compound are prepared using uninoculated BHI broth.   The<br>
concentrations of the test compound used range from 200 ng/ml to 0,098 pg/ml by two-fold<br>
serial dilutions. The P. multocida inoculated BHI is diluted with uninoculated BHI broth to make<br>
a 104 cell suspension per 200 pi.  The BHI cell suspensions are mixed with respective serial<br>
dilutions of the test compound, and incubated at 37°C for 18 hours.  The minimum inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) is equal to the concentration of the compound exhibiting 100% inhibition of<br>
growth of P. multocida as determined by comparison with an uninoculated control.<br>
Assay III This assay is based on the agar dilution method using a Steers Replicator. Two to five colonies isolated from an agar plate are inoculated into BHI broth and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm).   The next morning, 300 fd of the fully grown P. haemolytica preculture is inoculated Into 3 ml of fresh BHI broth and is incubated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). The appropriate amounts of the test compounds are dissolved in ethanol and a series of two-fold serial dilutions are prepared.  Two ml of the respective serial dilution is mixed with 18 ml of molten BHI agar and solidified. When the inoculated P. haemolytica culture reaches 0.5 McFarland standard density, about 5 pi of the P. haemolytica culture is inoculated onto BHI agar plates containing the various concentrations of the test compound using a Steers Replicator and incubated for 18 hours at 37"C. Initial concentrations of the test compound range from 100-200 \io)m\. The MIC is equal to the concentration of the test compound exhibiting 100% inhibition of growth of P. haemolytica as determined by comparison with an uninoculated control.<br>
