				<td>FIELD<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   laundry   deterent   bar   eomposition Specifically, the present invention relates to a laundry  detergent bar composition containing an anionic surfactant<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In many locales, laundry detergent bars are used for cleaning clothes Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating laundry detergent bars which are effective in cleaning clothes, which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water, and in hard and soft water, which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel, which have low smear and rapid drying, and which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Laundry detergent bar processes are also well known in the art. Prior art disclosing laundry detergent bars and laundry detergent bar processes include: U S Patent 3,178,370, Okenfuss, issued April 13, 1965, and Philippine Patent 13778 to Anderson, issued September 23, 1980.<br>
Surfactants, especially anionic surfactants, are well-known to provide detersive benefits in laundry detergent bars Certain surfactants, such as anionic surfactants, are especially useful in laundry detergent bar compositions, as they contain a hydrophobic portion which may attach to soils, and a hydrophilic portion which hydrogen bonds to water Thus, such surfactants can provide detersive benefits as they bind to soils, and remove them from, for example, fabrics and clothing. Typical anionic surfactants include soaps and non-soap surfactants.<br>
Linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) is a common non-soap anionic surfactant in cleaning compositions, and especially laundry detergent bars, as it provides excellent soil removal benefits, and is widely available. Recently, greater attention has been paid to the environment by society, corporations, and<br>
governments. Thus, it has become highly desirable to increase the biodegradability of products, such as detergent compositions LAS is a highly preferred, easily biodegradable surfactant.<br>
To produce LAS, paraffin and benzene from, for example, crude oil, are typically combined in a catalytic process to produce linear alkyl benzene .(LAB). Catalytic processes for producing  LAB  utilize catalysts containing aluminum chloride,   hydrofluoric  acid,  and  fluorine-containing  mordenite.     The   LAB   is sulfonated with sulfuric and/or sulfonic acid, and subsequently neutralized with an alkaline material to produce the corresponding alkaline salt of LAS, such as the sodium salt of LAS.   However, in the typical LAB production process, certain less-biodegradable by-products are also produced, such as dialkyl tetralin and dialkyl indan, and/or other dialkyl bi-cyclic benzene (DBB) impurities    The DBB content  in   LAB typically ranges  from  2% to  8%,  or more     When   DBB  is sulfonated,   it  becomes  a  corresponding   dialkyl  bi-cyclic  benzene   sulfonate (DBBS), such as a dialkyl tetralin sulfonate or a dialkyl indan sulfonate, which is less biodegradable than the parent LAS.  Due to the substantially shortened alkyl chain lengths on these impurities, they are not effective surfactants for cleaning Accordingly, it is desirable to reduce the DBB and DBBS content of LAB and LAS, respectively.<br>
Another common issue facing formulators of laundry detergent bars is maintaining bar hardness A laundry detergent bar formula rich in LAS is often quite soft, and not preferred by consumers A laundry detergent bar which is too soft wears too quickly; such a laundry detergent bar is unacceptable to consumers, who interpret it as uneconomical. Thus, various bar hardening technologies are often required, which include the use of co-syrfactants., structurants, soaps, fillers, and combinations thereof into the laundry detergent bar matrix<br>
Accordingly, the need remains for a laundry detergent bar having<br>
improved surfactancy, and increased biodegradability. There also remains a<br>
need for a laundry detergent bar which also possesses acceptable in-use wear<br>
rates, hardness, durability, rapid drying, and low smear.	'<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that a laundry detergent bar may possess improved surfactancy and  increased biodegradability.     It has also been found that a<br>
laundry detergent bar may also prossess acceptable m-use wear rates, hardness, durability, rapid drying, and/or low smear<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry detergent bar containing a linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant and the balance adjunct materials. The linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant has at least 30 molar % 2-phenyl isomer and less than about 5 weight % dialkyl bi-cyclic benzene sulfonate impurities<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present idsclosure with the appended claims<br>

A.	from about  1   to 99% of a linear alkyl     benzene sulfonate surfactant<br>
comprising-<br>
i.	from 30 - 100 molar % 2-phenyl isomer, and<br>
n	from 0-5 weight % dialkyl bi-cyclic benzene sulfonate impurities;<br>
and<br>

The loundry detergent bar o (Formula Removed)  the present invention has a <br>
Synergistic composition the constituents of which are not reacting chemically but <br>
Are interacting synergistically to give unexpected result<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that the use of a specific linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant may provide improved surfactancy as well as increased biodegradability Such an linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant may also possess one or more other surprising benefits when included in a laundry detergent bar, such as acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, rapid drying, and/or low smear.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight of the laundry detergent bar, unless otherwise specified All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise specified All documents cited are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" means a hydrocarbyl moiety which is straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated Unless otherwise specified, alkyl moieties are preferably saturated or unsaturated with double bonds, preferably with less than two double bonds Included in the term "alkyl" is the alkyl portion of acyl groups.<br>
The term "linear" as used herein, with respect to LAB and/or LAS, indicates that the alkyl portions thereof contain less than about 30%, preferably less than bout 20%, more preferably less than about 10% branched alkyl chains<br>
The term "substantially free" as used herein indicates that the impurities contained in the laundry detergent bar of the present invention contains are insufficient to contribute positively or negatively to the cleaning effectiveness of the composition The laundry detergent bar of the present invention preferably contains, by weight, less than about 5%, more preferably less than about 2%, and even more preferably less than about 0 5% of the indicated material.<br><br>
It is desirable to increase the surfactancy of, for example, LAS   Typically, LAB and the corresponding LAS contains a distribution of isomers in which the benzene moiety is attached in various positions on the hydrophobic alkyl chain It is the hydrophobic portion of LAS which attaches to soils on.   For a given alkyl chain length, the most hydrophobic alkyl chain is achieved when the benzene ring is attached to the alkyl chain at the 2-position, because this provides the longest hydrophobic "tail."   Such an LAS is described as the "2-phenyl LAS" isomer and possesses improved surfactancy as compared to corresponding isomers where the benzene moiety is attached to the alkyl chain at, for example, the 3-position.   Such improved surfactancy may result in improved removal of hydrophobic soils from clothing.     However, the typical LAB used to form LAS contains a distribution of various LAB isomers, such as 2-phenyl LAB, 3-phenyl LAB, 4-phenyl LAB, etc.<br>
As noted above, typical LAB is a mixture of 2-phenyl isomers, 3-phenyl isomers, etc. The general structures for these two isomers are described, below:<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R, represents a linear alkyl group, typically R1 is between about 6 and about 19 carbon atoms in length (i.e., the alkyl chain, excluding the benzene group, is thus typically from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms in length). These LAB isomers are then sulfonated to produce LAS. Accordingly, for a given alkyl chain, it is desirable to attach the benzene moiety as close to a terminal end as possible, so as to achieve the most hydrophobic isomer. A more hydrophobic isomer in turn, leads to increased surfactancy.<br>
Recently, new LAB production processes have been disclosed which employ more selective catalysts and thus result in LAB having higher molar proportions of the 2-phenyl LAB isomer, without a corresponding increase in the DBB content. It is known that the LAS formed from such LAB has a high average level of hydrophobicity and thus improved soil removal benefits. However, it has now been recognized that the LAS described above also possesses increased crystallinity and a reduced dissolution rate, and is therefore<br>
especially useful in a laundry detergent bar.   Without intending to be limited by<br>
theory, it is believed that such LAS has a high degree of molecular regularity,<br>
which in turn leads to a very uniform LAS crystal lattice when used in a solid<br>
detergent composition, such as a laundry detergent bar.<br>
&gt;	The present invention also recognizes that in addition to the increased<br>
crystallinity caused by a higher proportion of 2-phenyl LAS, the reduction of DBBS impurities also increases the crystallinity and decreases the dissolution rate of solid compositions containing this LAS.  Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the reduction of DBBS also increases the crystallinity and  reduces the dissolution  rate via two  mechanisms.     First,  it  has  been recognized   herein  that  when   present,   DBBS   impurities   interfere   with  the regularity of the LAS crystalline lattice structure     Thus,  it is believed that a reduction of the DBBS content results in an increase in the crystallinity of the LAS.     Second,  it has been  further  recognized  that  DBBS  is  an  excellent hydrotrope for the corresponding linear alkyl benzene sulfonate.  Thus, when the DBBS content of the LAS is reduced, the dissolution rate of the LAS is also reduced.    In addition, such high crystallinity may lead to increased gel layer formation upon contact with water, which further reduces the dissolution rate of a solid composition.<br>
In most solid detergent forms, such as detergent granules, the increase in crystallinity and reduction in dissolution rate are undesirable. However, it has now surprisingly been recognized that high crystallinity and a reduced dissolution rate are highly desirable in a laundry detergent bar composition The inclusion of such an LAS having a high proportion of 2-phenyl isomer and low levels of DBBS in a laundry detergent bar, provides significant advantages. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the increase in crystallinity increases the hardness of the laundry detergent bar. Such an increase in hardness may, for example, simultaneously decrease the in-use wear rate and increase the durability of the laundry detergent bar. As an additional benefit, the increased hardness also provides a longer-lasting laundry detergent bar This is highly desirable as customers believe that such bars provide a better value.<br>
While the decrease in the dissolution rate is detrimental to the performance of, for example, granular detergents, it is desirable in laundry detergent bars. If laundry detergent bar dissolves too quickly, its in-use rate is unacceptably fast for the average consumer.   However, a laundry detergent bar<br>
which dissolves more slowly gives the consumer an impression of better value and economy.     Furthermore,  it would be expected that a decrease in  the dissolution rate would correspondingly decrease the cleaning effectiveness of a laundry detergent bar.   Surprisingly, the present invention may instead provide significantly enhanced cleaning.   Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that as a detergent bar is typically rubbed directly onto clothing, and subsequently rinsed by hand, the overall performance of detergent composrtion is not impaired by the slower dissolution rate of the LAS    As the nature of a laundry detergent bar is to be rubbed directly onto the fabric to be washed, it is believed that any possible dissolution negatives are overcome by the greater surfactancy and cleaning ability of the LAS described herein.   Additionally, the slower dissolution   rate  may  contribute to more  rapid  drying  of the  laundry detergent bar, which in turn reduces bar smear.<br>
An additional benefit of the present invention is that fewer, or lowered levels of, structurants, fillers, and/or co-surfactants may be required herein This may lower the formulation cost of the laundry detergent bar, and thus provide additional value for customers. Alternatively, it allows greater flexibility in formulating laundry detergent bars with acceptable physical properties and cleaning abilities. One especially advantageous point is that a bleach, i.e , sodium perborate monohydrate or sodium percarbonate, is easier to incorporate into the laundry detergent bar of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the LAS useful herein typically contains at least about 30 molar % 2-phenyl isomer, preferably at least 40 molar % 2-phenyl isomer, more preferably at least 50 molar % 2-phenyl isomer, and even more preferably at least 60 molar % 2-phenyl isomer. Such molar percentages of 2-phenyl isomers in the LAB provide the improved surfactancy and increased crystallinity desired in the present invention.<br>
As defined herein, the "molar %" of any given isomer X in a LAB or an LAS sample may be determined by the following formula:<br>
molar % of isomer X = (moles of isomer X) / (total moles of LAB or LAS) It is well known in the art to determine compositional parameters of conventional LAB  and  LAS.     See, for example  Surfactant Science Series, Volume 40, Chapter 7 and Surfactant Science Series, Volume 73, Chapter 7 Typically this  is  done  by  GC   and/or  GC-mass  spectroscopy for the  alkyl benzenes and HPLC for the alkyl benzene sulfonates or sulfonic acids; 13C NMR<br><br>
is also commonly used. Another common practice is desulfonation   This permits GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy to be used, since desulfonation converts the sulfonates or sulfonic acids to the alkyl benzenes which are tractable by such methods.   A preferred method is to prepare LAB sample solution at 100 mg/ml concentration by dissolving 0.5 g of LAB sample in 5 ml of n-hexane.  1 µL of this solution is then injected into a GC/MS equipped with an ionization detector.   The resulting chromatogram is analyzed based on the MS results   The minor peaks in-between all linear alkyl benzene species are summarized and calculated as the sum of the DBB impurities, including dialkyl tetralins and dialkyl indans Specifically, the GC/MS instrument suitable for such analysis can be HP 5890 II GC/HP 5971 MSD (ANI-59).   The GC/FID system can be HP 5890 II GC (ANI-61)   A GC column of Rtx-5MS, Restek (GC-C-116) and a pre-column of 0.25 mm ID 5 m length with helium at 50 kPa as the carrier gas.  For mass identifications, the column is kept at 100 °C for 1 minute then increased to 180 °C at 2 °C/min The FIC is operated at 70 eV   The mass scan was done in between 50 to 500 m/z at 3 scans/sec.   The sample injection was done with a splitter at a ratio of 100 to 1.   For quantitation of species by GC/FID, the system can be operated at 120 kPa helium carrier gas with all other parameters staying the same.<br>
The DBB impurities are formed in the LAB production process when a single alkyl chain interacts with the same benzene ring twice Typical dialkyl bi-cyclic benzene impurities have the following structures<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
where R2 and R3 are alkyl chains of at least 1 carbon atom each; e.g., for dialkyl tetralin, R2 + R3 + 2 = from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, for dialkyl indan, R2 + R3 + 3 = from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, etc. Because such impurities and their sulfonated counterparts are significantly less biodegradable than, for example, LAB and LAS, it is desirable to reduce the DBBS content to as low a level as possible. Also, as recognized herein, such a reduction in the DBBS content of the LAS further enhances the crystallinity of the LAS.<br>
Therefore, the LAS useful herein contains, by weight of the LAS, less than about 5 weight % DBBS impurities, preferably less than about 3 weight % DBBS impurities, more preferably less than about 2 weight % DBBS impurities, and even more preferably less than about 1 weight % DBBS impurities.   In a highly preferred embodiment, the LAS herein is substantially free of DBBS impurities. In a more preferred  embodiment of the  present  invention,  the  LAS   herein contains, by weight of the LAS, less than about 2.5 weight % dialkyl tetralin sulfonate impurities,  preferably less than  about  1.3 weight % dialkyl tetralin sulfonate impurities, and more preferably less than about 0.5 weight % dialkyl tetralin sulfonate impurities.   The weight % of DBBS impurities such as dialkyl tetralin sulfonates and dialkyl mdan sulfonates may be determined by methods such as those described above (e.g , GC or HPLC) for characterizing LAB and/or LAS.<br>
Processes for forming LAB having a high proportion of 2-phenyl isomer and a "low" DBB content are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,196,574 to Kocal, issued Mar 23, 1993; U.S  Patent 5,770,782 to Knifton et al., issued June 23, 1998;, and U.S. Patent 5,777,187 to Knifton et al., issued July 7, 1998.   The LAB useful herein is also available as DETAL® LAS from Petresa Corporation, of Ville de Becancour,  Canada; from Universal Oil Products Company,  of Des Plaines,  Illinois,  U S.A.; and Huntsman  Petrochemical Corporation, of Austin, Texas, U.S.A. For further information about LAB production processes, please see "Recent Advances  in the  Production  of Detergent  Olefins  and   Linear Alkylbenzenes" by Vora et al., published in Tenside Surfactants. Detergents, vol. 28, pp. 287-294, 1991, and "Science and Technology in Catalysis 1994" by T Imai et al., published in Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, vol. 92, pp 339-342, 1995.<br>
Generally, the laundry detergent bars herein typically comprise from about 1% to about 99%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, and more preferably from about 5% to about 25% LAS as described herein, by weight of the laundry detergent bar. It is also desirable that the LAS useful herein has from about 8 to about 22, preferably from about 8 to about 18, and more preferably from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, for example, the C10.16 linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. The LAS suitable for use herein includes the water-soluble salts, preferably the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium salts of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl<br>
group containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, as described above, and a sulfonic acid group. The alkali metal salts, particularly the sodium salts, the potassium salts, or mixtures thereof are preferred.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, an effective amount of an added hydrotrope may be provided and added to the LAS described herein, or a laundry deterqent bar containing the LAS described herein._. The "added hydrotrope herein is a hydrotrope which is deliberately added to the LAB, linear alkyl benzene acid active, LAS, and/or a composition containing the LAS, and is not intended to include those hydrotropes which are present solely as byproducts of the LAB production process However, if a compound is present as a by product additional amounts of this same compound are added to the<br>
LAB, linear alkyl benzene acid active, LAS, and/or a composition containing the LAS as a hydrotrope, then these additional amounts added would be considered an "added hydrotrope" herein Of course, it is highly preferred that any added hydrotrope be biodegradable, preferably at least as biodegradable as the LAS parent compound.<br>
Such an effective amount of an added hydrotrope may, for example, ease processing. In such an embodiment, the "effective amount" of added hydrotrope useful herein is preferably at least about 0.1%, more preferably from about 1% to about 25%, and even more preferably from about 1% to about 10%, by weight of the LAS. However, in certain cases, as where a very crystalline or slow-dissolving laundry detergent bar is desired, the hydrotrope may reduce the effects of the LAS described herein. Thus, in an especially preferred embodiment, the laundry detergent bar is substantially free of added hydrotrope<br>
The added hydrotrope useful herein may be either branched, linear, aromatic, or a mixture thereof Linear added hydrotropes having an attached aromatic moiety are preferred herein. The added hydrotrope precursor includes non-sulfonatable added hydrotropes and sulfonatable added hydrotropes having sulfonatable functional groups, such as an alkyl benzene, an olefin (e.g., an alpha olefin or an internal olefin) with at least one carbon-carbon double bond, a methyl or ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid, an alkyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof The alkyls and alkyl benzenes useful herein as added hydrotrope precursors typically contain from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms in their alkyl chains, while the olefins, methyl esters, and alkyl alcohols typically contain less than or equal to about 10 carbon atoms therein.   Nonlimiting examples of the preferred added<br>
hydrotrope include the alkali metal and ammonium salts, preferably the sodium, potassium, ammonium, and magnesium salts of the above compounds Specifically, the added hydrotrope useful herein includes a paraffin sulfonate, an alkyl benzene sulfonate, an olefin sulfonate, a methyl or ethyl ester sulfonate, an alkyl sulphate, non-sulfonated added hydrotropes, and mixtures thereof. Non-sulfonated added hydrotropes useful herein include octanol ethoxylates, hexanol ethoxylates, ethylhexanol ethoxylates, secondary alcohol ethoxylates, octanol monoglyceride, hexanol monoglycende, ethylhexanol glyceride, octyl glycoside or di-glycosides, octanoic mono-amine glucose amide, hexanoic mono-amine glycose amide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of preferred sulfonatable added hydrotropes useful herein include toluene sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, cumene sulfonate, olefin sulfonates, methyl ester sulfonates, alcohol sulfates, and mixtures thereof If present, the added hydrotrope or its precursor may be added at any stage of the laundry detergent bar process, for example, prior to an LAB sulfonation step, or after addition of the LAS. Preferably, the added hydrotrope or its precursor is added to the LAB and homogenized therewith. The homogenized mixture is then sulfonated, and neutralized to form an LAS surfactant paste, which is further processed into a laundry detergent bar.<br>
Such added hydrotropes are commonly available from, for example, Rutgers Organics Corp. in U.S.A.; Albright &amp; Wilson Corporation, of U.K.; and Marchon Corporation, of France or Italy. Their precursors, i.e. toluene, xylene, cumene, etc., are widely available from companies such as Basis Petroleum, Exxon; Texaco of Houston, Texas, U. S. A.; Petroquimica Uniao Sa of San Paulo, Brazil; Fina Oil of Dallas, Texas, U. S. A.; etc.<br>
The laundry detergent bar of the present invention contains a linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant as described herein, and the balance adjunct materials Typical adjunct materials useful herein jnclude a bleach, a builder, a chelating agent, an enzyme, a filler, other surfactants, a soil suspension agent, a structurant, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The bleach useful herein is typically a bleach precursor product, but may include an actual bleach, such as, for example, a hypochlorite bleach. Typically, a bleach precursor product containing an active oxygen source is provided herein. The active oxygen source useful herein includes compounds which form available peroxyacid oxygen when exposed to a bleach activator, an alkalinity<br>
source, and moisture. An active oxygen source can be hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or both The active oxygen source useful in the present invention can be any of the oxidizing agents known for laundry, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing, or denture cleaning purposes, including oxygen. A preferred active oxygen source of the peroxygen type includes hydrogen peroxide, inorganic per-compounds, inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates, and mixtures thereof; a more preferred active oxygen source includes hydrogen peroxide, perborate, percarbonate, and mixtures thereof If present, an active oxygen source will typically be at a level of from about 1% to about 30%, more typically from about 5% to about 20%, of the laundry detergent bar.<br>
When commingled with the active oxygen source, the bleach activator product leads to production of available peroxyacid oxygen    A bleach activator may comprise an alkalinity source, either alone, or in conjunction with amides, imides,   esters,   anhydrides,   and   mixtures   thereof.      Usually,   at   least   one substituted or unsubstituted acyl moiety is present, covalently connected to a leaving group as in the structure R-C(0)-L.    The atom in the leaving group connecting to the peracid-forming acyl moiety R(C)0- is most typically O or N A bleach activator can have non-charged, positively or negatively charged peracid-forming moieties and/or noncharged, positively or negatively charged leaving groups.

Builders may optionally be included in the laundry detergent bars herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of particulate soils. Laundry detergent bars typically contain from about 3% to about 60%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, more preferably from about 10% to about 30% builder, by weight of the final composition.<br>
Useful inorganic or phosphate-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates   (exemplified  by  the  tripolyphosphates,   pyrophosphates,   and glassy   polymeric   meta-phosphates),    phosphonates,   phytic   acid,   silicates, carbonates   (including   bicarbonates   and   sesquicarbonates),   sulphates,   and aluminosilicates such as zeolites.  However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales.   Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly we/I even  in  the  presence  of the  so-called  "weak"  builders  (as  compared  with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.    Specific examples of a non-phosphate builder, such as inorganic detergency builders, include the water soluble inorganic carbonate and bicarbonate salts. The alkali metal (e.g , sodium and potassium)  carbonates and  bicarbonates are particularly useful herein. Other   specifically   preferred   examples   of   a   builder   useful   herein   include polycarboxylates.    Especially preferred as builders herein are co-polymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the laundry detergent bar of the present invention is substantially free of phosphate.<br>
The optional chelating agent may be one or more iron and/or manganese chelating agents. Such chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures therein, all as hereinafter defined. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional ability to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of soluble chelates. Amino carboxylates useful as optional chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetrace-<br>
tates,	N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetates,	nitnlotnacetates,<br>

Bar Processing<br>
The laundry detergent bars of the present invention may be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some of all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
The preferred mixer type to be used is a high shear mixer. Suitable equipment can include: Sigma (single arm or double arms) blender, manufactured by Mazzoni; Winkworth RT 25 series, manufactured by Winkworth Machinery Ltd., Berkshire, U.K.; Eirich, series RV, manufactured by Gustau Eirich Hardheim, Germany; Lodige, series FM for batch mixing; series Baud KM for continuous mixing, manufactured by Lodige Machinenbau GmbH.    Other<br>
types of suitable mixers for this application are Twin Screw Extruders, supplied by APV Bakes (CP series), Werner and Pfleiderer (continua series). Preferably, more than one mixer is used herein<br>
In a preferred process, the raw materials are mixed in the blender.   An acid active, such as a linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid corresponding to the    LAS described  herein,  is  preferably premixed with  an added  hydrotrope. if    present, and then reacted with alkaline inorganic salts such, as builder, to  complete neutralization    The amount of alkaline  inorganic salt  is  at least   sufficient to completely neutralize the acid active.  In an alternate process, a pre-neutralized LAS surfactant as described herein is added in the blender    Other adjunct materials are then added to the mixture, such as coconut fatty alkyl sulfate   If present, the added hydrotrope may also be added at this point.  Some of the adjunct materials may be present in the mixer when the LAS is added thereto. Alternatively, the adjunct materials may be added thereafter.<br>
The composition is then mixed to homogeneity. The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill, or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor, and further processed to form a laundry detergent bar.<br>
A preferred mixed LAS/alkyl sulfate laundry detergent bar composition is made by the following method. The raw materials are first mixed in a blender. Sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized coconut fatty alkyl sulfate is mixed for about 1-2 minutes. This is followed by the addition of a linear alkyl benzene acid active corresponding to the LAS described herein. This acid active is then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (Sodium carbonate should be present in at least a stoichiometric amount sufficient to neutralize the acid active.) Sodium tripolyphosphate may also be present, or may pe aaded after the acid incompletely neutralized. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, an optional chelant, if present is added, followed by any other surfactants, and any other adjunct materials. The mixing may take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about 5 to about 10 minutes. As one of the last ingredients, bleach and enzymes are added to the mixture and then mixed for an additional one to five minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage. This laundry detergent bar is substantially free of an added hydrotrope.<br>
Bar Physical Properties<br>
Laundry detergent bars of the present invention possess acceptable physical properties such as hardness, a smooth feel, rapid drying, and acceptable in-use properties.<br>
A preferred method to measure the hardness of the solid composition is to measure the penetration of a needle through the surface under a standard weight, for 5 seconds using a cone penetrometer. One such penetrometer is made by Associated Instrument Manufacturers India Pvt Ltd. (Model number AIM 512). The weight of the rod and the cone is 149 grams and an additional 50 gram weight is placed on the cone The penetration reading of a fresh, acceptable laundry bar will typically be about 35-50 (1/10 mm) immediately after plodding. Acceptable laundry bars aged about 3 days at ambient conditions will typically have a bar penetration reading of about 5-25 (1/10 mm).<br>
Yet another physical property of consumer relevance is the rate of drying of the bar after usage and storage under high humidity conditions. A preferred method to measure this property is to place a bar with dimensions of 75mm x 55mm with one of its large flat surface in contact with about 20 ml of water in a petri dish for 2 hours and then scraping the gel formed. This procedure is repeated for a second cycle except that the gel is not scraped off from the bar surface after the second contact with water The bar is then stored under 30 degrees C and 88% Relative Humidity for 24 hours and then the bar surface which was exposed to the water is graded for dryness on a 1-5 grading scale by experienced operators as illustrated below.<br>
Dryness Grade	Physical state of the bar surface<br>
1	very wet, very soft, melting, soft core<br>
2	wet, soft gef, hard core<br>
3	somewhat dry (moist), feels soft<br>
4	somewhat dry ( moist), feels hard<br>
5	completely dry, hard<br>
For good consumer acceptance, the desired dryness grade is typically between 3 5-5.0   Preferred bars of the present invention have a dryness grade within this       range.<br>
Examples of the invention are set forth hereinafter by way of illustration and are not intended to be in any way limiting of the invention<br>
In the Examples herein, the following definitions appiy CX.YLAS:        LAS as described herein,  containing an average of from x to y<br>
