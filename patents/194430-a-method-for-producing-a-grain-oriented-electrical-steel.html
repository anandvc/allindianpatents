				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates a method of producing grain oriented electrical-steel from a hot processed strip using at least two cold reductions More specifically, the hot processed strip contains 2 5-4 5% silicon, 0 1-1 2% chromium, less than 0 050% carbon, less than 0 005% aluminum, has a volume resistivity of at least 45 µO-cm, at least 0 010% carbon so that an austenite volume fraction (?1150°c) of at least 2 5% is present in the strip and that each surface of the strip has an tsomorphic layer having a thickness of at least 10% of the total thickness of the strip<br>
Electrical steels are broadly characterized into two classes Non-onented electrical steels are engineered to provide a sheet characterized with magnetic properties nearly uniform in all directions These steels are comprised of iron, silicon and/or aluminum to impart higher specific electrical resistivity to the steel sheet and thereby lower core loss Non-oriented electrical steels may also contain manganese, phosphorus and other elements commonly known in the art to provide higher volume resistivity which lowers core losses treated during magnetization<br>
Grain oriented electrical steels are engineered to provide a sheet with high volume resistivity-and having highly directional magnetic properties owing to the development of a preferential grain orientation Grain oriented electrical steels are further differentiated by the level of magnetic properties developed, the grain growth inhibitors used and the processing steps which provide the desired magnetic properties Regular (conventional) grain oriented<br>
.<br>
electrical steels contain silicon to provide higher volume resistivity and have a magnetic permeability measured at 796 A/m of at least 1780 High permeability grain oriented electrical steels contain silicon to provide higher volume resistivity and have a magnetic permeability measured at 796 A/m of at least 1880 The volume resistivity of commercially produced silicon-bearing grain oriented electrical steels ranges from 45 to 50 Jin-cm, containing from 2 95% to 3 45% silicon with iron and other impurities incidental to the method of melting and steelmaking employed It also is known that the use of increased silicon also requires more carbon to maintain a small, but necessary, amount of austenue during processing However, these changes in composition result in a strip with poorer mechanical properties and increased physical difficulties during processing due to greater brittleness caused by the higher silicon and carbon levels<br>
Regular grain oriented electrical steels also typically contain additions of manganese and sulfur (and possibly selenium) as the principal grain growth inhibitors Other elements such as aluminum, antimony, boron, copper, nitrogen and the like are sometimes present<br><br>
2<br>
and may supplement tne manganese sulfide/selemde inhibitors to provide grain growth inhibition<br>
Regular grain oriented electrical steel may have a mill glass film, commonly called forsterite, or an insutative coating, commonly called a secondary coating, applied over or in place of the mill glass film, or may have a secondary coating designed for punching operations where laminations free of mill glass coating are desired in order to avoid excessive die wear Generally, magnesium oxide is applied onto the surface of the steel prior to a high temperature final anneal This primarily serves as an annealing separator coating, however, these coatings may also influence the development and stability of secondary grain growth during the final high temperature anneal and react to form the forsterite (or mill glass) coating on the steel and effect desulfunzation of the steel during annealing<br>
To obtain a high degree of cube-on-edge orientation, the material must have a structure of recrystalhzed grains with the desired orientation prior to the high temperature portion of the final anneal and must have a grain growth inhibitor to restrain primary grain growth in the final anneal until secondary grain growth occurs Of great importance in the development of the magnetic properties of electrical steel is the vigor and completeness of secondary grain growth This depends on two factors First, a fine dispersion of manganese sulfide (or other) inhibitor particles capable of restraining primary grain growth in the temperature range of 535-925°C is needed Second, the grain structure and texture of the steel and of the surface and near-surface layers of the steel must provide conditions appropriate for secondary grain growth The near-surface layer describes the region of the steel surface which has been depleted of carbon and proyides a single phase or isomorphic fernte microstructure 1 his region has been referred to in the art as the surface decarbunzed layer and the like or, in an alternative form, is defined by the boundary between the isomorphic surface layer and the polymorphic (mixed phases of fernte and austenite or its decomposition products) interior layers, such as the shear band and the like The role of the isomorphic layer has been reported in numerous technical publications which show that cube-on-edge secondary grain nuclei with the highest likelihood of sustaining vigorous growth and providing a high degree of cube-on-edge grain orientation in the finally annealed grain oriented electrical steel are located within the isomorphic layers or, alternatively, near the boundary between the isomorphic surface layer and polymorphic sheet interior layer The cube-on-edge nuclei which have sufficiently favorable conditions to initiate secondary grain growth consume the less perfectly oriented matrix of primary grains<br>
Regular gram oriented electrical steel is generally produced using one or more cold reductions in order to achieve the desired magnetic properties A representative process for producing regular grain oriented electrical steel using two stages of cold redaction is taught<br><br>
in US patent 5.061,326, incorporated herein by reference US patent 5.061.326 discloses using higher levels of silicon to improve the core losses of grain oriented electrical steels Such additions contnbuted to poorer  physical properties and greater difficulties-in processing, principally resulting from a increase in the bnttleness of the material<br>
It also has been desired to produce grain oriented electrical steel using a single cold reduction with low core loss made by increasing the volume resistivity of the steel US patent 5,421,911, incorporated herein by reference, discloses chromium can be a useful addition to an oriented electrical steel made .using a single cold reduction provided other process requirements are satisfied, including a composition providing levels of uncombined manganese and tin of 0 030% or less, an anneal of the starting strip, a carbon level of 0 025%. or more after annealing and prior to cold roiling, an austenite volume fraction (? 1150°c) in excess of 7% after annealing and prior to cold rolling, and use of a sulfur-bearing annealing separator coating<br>
Accordingly, there has been a long felt need for controlling the alloy composition and processing to provide a grain growth inhibitor and an appropriate micro structure and texture essential to producing grain oriented electrical steels having uniform and consistent magnetic properties There has also been a long felt need for providing a grain oriented electrical steel having a high degree of cube-on-edge orientation and a high level of volume resistivity using large chromium additions in place of or in addition to silicon in a grain oriented electrical steel There has also been a long felt need for providing a grain oriented electrical steel having stable secondary gram growth<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing grain oriented electrical steel having excellent mechanical and magnetic properties A hot processed strip having a thickness of about 1 5-4 0 mm is provided having a composition consisting essentially of 2 5-4 5% silicon, 0 1-1 2% chromium, less than 0 050% carbon, less than 0 005% aluminum, up to 0 1% sulfur, up to 0 14% selenium, 0 01-1% manganese and balance being essentially iron and residual elements All discussion in the present patent application relating to alloy composition percentages (%) are in terms of weight (wt %) unless otherwise noted The hot processed strip has a volume resistivity of at least 45 µO -cm, at least 0 010% carbon so that an austenite volume fraction (? 1150°c) prior to cold reduction is at least 2 5% present in the hot processed strip and each surface of the hot processed strip has an isomorphic layer having a thickness of at least 10% of the total thickness of the hot processed strip The hot processed strip is cold reduced to an intermediate thickness, annealed, cold reduced to a final thickness final strip thickness preferably of 0 15-0 50 mm and decarbunzed to less than 0 003% carbon The decarburized strip then is coated on at 'east one surface with an annealing separator coating and final annealed to effect secondary grain growth The electrical steel has a permeability measured at 796 A/m of at least 1780 The steel is decarbunzed to less than 0 003% carbon so that the stnp after final annealing will not magnetically age  The chromium-silicon grain oriented electrical steel of this<br><br>
6<br>
invention provides high volume resistivity, very stable secondary grain growth, excellent magnetic properties and improved mechanical property characteristics that provide superior toughness and greater resistance to stnp breakage during processing<br>
The starting steel of the invention is made from hot processed strip By "hot processed strip", it will be understood to mean a continuous length of strip produced using methods such as ingot casting, thick slab casting, thin slab casting, strip casting or other methods of compact strip production using a melt composition containing iron, silicon, chromium and a suitable inhibitor<br>
Grain oriented electrical steels have traditionally been ternary carbon-silicon-iron compositions which attempted to limit the compositions of manganese, sulfur, chromium, nitrogen and titanium because of their influence on the magnetic quality of materials so produced The discovery of the present invention was the result of studies of the_effect of carbon, silicon and chromium on the microstructural characteristics of steel strip allowing successful production of a chromium-silicon regular grain oriented electrical steel The present invention provides a method of producing grain oriented electrical steel having a high quality cube-on-edge orientation and a volume resistivity in excess of 45 µO -cm and, thereby, low core losses using less than 0 005% aluminum and at least two cold reductions Equation 1 illustrates the effects of various additions to iron on the volume resistivity (p) of the alloy as<br><br>
wherein p is the volume resistivity of the alloy in units of µO -cm and Mn, Si, Al, Cr and P are the percentages of manganese, silicon, aluminum, chromium and phosphorus respectively comprising the chemistry of the grain oriented electrical steel The volume resistivity of commercially produced oriented silicon-iron electrical steels ranges from 45 to 51 µO -cm, which contain from 2.95-3 45% silicon and other impurities incidental to the method of melting and steelmaking While higher volume resistivity materials have long been desired, the methods of the prior art typically rely on increasing the percentage of silicon in the alloy As has been shown in the art, increasing the percentage of silicon typically requires a corresponding increase in the percentage of carbon Higher percentages of silicon and carbon are well known to contribute to poorer physical properties in electrical steels, principally resulting from an increase in bnttleness and increased difficulty in completely removing carbon during the decarbulization annealing step It was determined that increasing the percentage of silicon and carbon also is harmful to the microstructural characteristics needed for vigorous secondary grain growth An important feature of the present invention is that the composition of silicon and carbon-alter the thickness of the. surface isomorphic layer provided in the strip before cold reduction<br><br>
7<br>
In prior methods of making grain oriented electrical steels using two or rnore cold reductions, chromium was found to interfere with the development of the desired cube-on-edge texture In the present invention, it was determined that chromium also causes a similar thinning of the isomorphic layer owing to its effect on austenite formation and its effect on carbon losses during processing This heretofore unrecognized,change was found to adversely affect the stability and vigor of secondary grain growth<br>
Unstable secondarv grain growth is a problem which has troubled the producers of grain oriented silicon steel for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the quality of the grain growth inhibitor, the quality of the microstructure of the starting strip or other elements in the alloy composition pertinent to a particular method For example, the percentage of excess manganese not combined with sulfur and/or the amount of austenite contribute strongly to the stability of secondary grain growth using a single cold reduction process disclosed in US oatent 5.421.911.,An important feature of the present invention is that the stability of secondary grain growth and the development of the desired cube-on-edge texture has been related to the thickness of the surface isomorphic layer and the amount of austenite provided prior to cold reduction<br>
A preferred composition of the present invention includes 2 9-3 8% silicon. 0 2-0 7% chromium, 0 015-0 030%,carbon, less than 0 005% aluminum, less than 0 010% nitrogen, 0 05-0 07%. manganese, 0 020-0 030% sulfur, 0015-0 05% selenium and less than 0.06%. tin A more preferred composition includes 3 1-3 5%  silicon Silicon is primarily added to improve the core loss by providing higher volume resistivity In addition, silicon promotes the formation and/or stabilization of ferrite and, as such, is one of the major elements affecting the volume fraction (? 1150°c) of  austenite While higher silicon is desired to improve the magnetic quality, its effect must be considered in order to maintain the desired phase balance, microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties<br>
Grain oriented electrical steel of the present invention may have chromium contents ranging from 0 10-1 2%, preferably 0 2 to 0 7% and more preferably 0 3-0 5% Chromium is added primarily to improve the core loss by providing higher volume resistivity. At compositions less than 1 2%. chromium promotes the formation and stabilization of austenite and affects the volume fraction (? 1150°c) of austenite Higher amounts of chromium adversely affect the ease of decarbunzation While higher chromium is desired to improve the magnetic quality, its effect must be considered in order to maintain the desired phase balance and microstructural characteristics<br>
Grain oriented electrical steel of the present invention contains carbon and/or additions sucn as copper, nickel and the like which promote and/or stabilize austenite, are employed to maintain the phase balance during processing The amount of carbon present in the hot processed strip is sufficient to provide a starting strip, i e , prior to cold rolling.<br><br>
8<br>
with 0 010-0 050% carbon, preferably 0 015-0,030% and more preferably 0 015-0 02556 Low percentages of carbon less than 0 010% immediately prior to the cold reduction to the intermediate thickness are undesirable because secondary recrystallization becomes unstable and the quality of the cube-on-edge orientation of the product is impaired High percentages of carbon above 0 050% are undesirable because they result in thinning of the isomorphic layer which weakens secondary grain growth and provides a lower quality cube-on-edge orientation, and increases the difficulty in obtaining carbon less than 0 003% in the final cold rolled strip to prevent magnetic aging<br>
Prior to the development of the present invention, carbon losses of up to 0 010% were observed after the hot processed strip was annealed prior to cold reduction to the intermediate thickness, typically at 1025-1050°C in a oxidizing atmosphere for 1 5-30 seconds and, in many cases, the carbon loss during the anneal was essential to develop an appropriately thick isomorphic layer However, excessive carbon removal during an anneal prior to a cold reduction to an intermediate strip thickness may result in an improper phase balance and microstructure and necessitate raising the carbon composition in the hot processed strip to compensate for these losses in subsequent processing In the present invention, the amount of carbon needed to be removed during decarbunzation annealing is greatly reduced.<br>
Manganese is present in the steels of the present invention in an amount of 0 01-0 15%, preferably of 0 04-0 08% and more preferably 0 05-0 07% If conventional methods of steel melting and casting wherein either ingots or continuously cast slabs are used to produce a starting strip for processing in accordance with the present invention, a lower percentage of excess manganese, i e , manganese uncombined as manganese sulfide or manganese selenide, is advantageous to ease dissolution of manganese sulfide during slab reheating prior to hot rolling<br>
Sulfur and selenium are added in the melt to combine with manganese to form the manganese sulfide and/or manganese selenide precipitates needed for primary grain growth , inhibition Sulfur, if used alone, will be present in amounts of from 0 006-0 06% and, preferably, of from 0 .020-0.030%. Selenium, if used alone, will be present in amounts of from 0 010-0 14% and, preferably, of from 0 015=0.05% Combinations of sulfur and selenium may be used.<br>
Acid soluble aluminum is maintained less than 0 005% and preferably less than 0 0015% in the steels of the present invention in order to provide stable secondary grain growth  While aluminum is helpful to control the amount of dissolved oxygen in the steel melt, the percentage of soluble aluminum must be maintained less than the upper limit<br>
The steel may also include other elements such as antimony, arsenic, bismuth, copper, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorus and the like made either as deliberate additions or present as residual elements, i. e , impurities from steelmaking process These elements<br><br>
can affect the austenite volume fraction (? 1150°c) and/or the stability of secondary grain growth<br>
It was discovered in the present invention that amounts of silicon, chromium and a suitable inhibitor along with other elements incidental to the method of stee lmaking must be specified in order to obtain an appropriately thick isomorphic layer while providing a small, but necessary amount of austenite in the starting strip prior to cold reduction Equation (2) below is an expanded form of an equation originally published by Sadayoriet al in their publication, "Developments of Gram Oriented Si-Steel Sheets with Low Iron Loss", Kawasaki Seitetsu Giho,vol 21, no 3, pp 93-98, 1989, to calculate the austenite volume fraction (? 1150°C) of iron containing 3 0-3 6% silicon and 0 030-0 065% carbon at a temperature of 1150°C Equation (2) has been expanded based on the present research to calculate the austenite volume fraction at 1150°C as<br>
(2) ? 1150°C = 64 8 - 23(%Si) + 5 06(%Cr +%Ni +%Cu) + 694(%C) + 347(%N)<br>
While silicon and carbon are the primary elements of concern, other elements such as chromium, nickel, copper, tin, phosphorus and the like, made as deliberate additions or present as impurities from the steelmaking process will also affect the amount of austenite and, if present in significant amounts, must be considered In the present invention, the thickness of the isomorphic layer and the austenite volume fraction have been found to be functions of the composition of the starting hot processed strip, changes in the carbon content incurred in converting the steel melt into the starting hot processed strip, the thickness (t) of the hot processed strip and changes in the carbon content to the hot processed strip if the strip is annealed prior to cold rolling to the intermediate thickness The change in the carbon content incurred in converting the steel melt into the starting hot processed strip has been found to be<br><br>
where Cmelt is the weight percentage of carbon provided in the steel melt, C1 is the weight percentage of carbon lost in the conversion of the steel melt into a hot processed strip and t is the thickness of the hot processed strip in mm If the hot processed strip is annealed pnor to cold rolling to an intermediate strip thickness, additional carbon loss may occur which must be considered as<br><br>
where C2 is the weight percentage of carbon lost in annealing the hot processed strip and %Cr is the weight percentage of chromium provided in the alloy Given that the amount of<br><br>
10<br>
carbon is dependent on the thickness (t) of the hot processed strip, the chromium content provided and the thickness of the hot processed strip, it is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that these compositions must be judiciously selected It is implicit in the teachings of the present invention that the carbon composition of the steel strip prior to cold rolling to the intermediate thickness must be sufficient to provide the desired percentage of austenite necessary for the development of stable and consistent secondary grain growth The carbon composition prior to cold rolling (C3) is used in Equation (2), that is<br><br>
Combining the factors from the above, the surface isomorphic layer can be calculated using Equation (6)<br><br>
where I is the calculated isomorphic layer thickness in mm, ? 1150°C is the calculated volume fraction of austenite in the strip prior to cold rolling to the intermediate thickness and %S1 is the weight percent of silicon contained in the alloy The thickness of the isomorphic layer on each surface of the hot processed strip prior to cold reduction to the intermediate thickness should be at least 10% of the total thickness of the hot processed strip Preferably, the thickness of each isomorphic layer should be 10-40%, more preferably 15-35% and most preferably 20-25% For a hot processed strip having a thickness of 1 5-4 0 mm, the minimum thickness of the isomorphic layer on each surface of the hot processed strip prior to cold reduction to the intermediate thickness would be about 0 15 mm<br>
The grain oriented electrical steel of the present invention may provide additional benefits or may require other processing adjustments The present invention can provide a grain oriented electrical steel sheet with high volume resistivity, improved toughness as illustrated in FIG 1 and reduced sensitivity to temperature during processing, and improved solidification characteristics during ingot, strand or strip casting owing to improved castability of the steel melt.<br>
The regular grain oriented electrical steel of the present invention can be produced from hot processed stnp made by a number of methods The strip can be produced from ingots, slabs produced from ingots or continuous cast slabs which are reheated to 1260-1400°C followed by hot rolling to provide a starting hot processed strip of 1 5-4 0 mm thickness The present invention also is applicable to strip produced by methods wherein continuous cast slabs or slabs produced from ingots are fed directly to the hot mill with or without significant heating, or ingots are hot reduced into slabs of sufficient temperature to hot roll to stnp with or without further heating, or the molten metal is cast directly into a<br><br>

strip suitable for further processing In some instances, equipment capabilities may be inadequate to provide the appropriate starting strip thickness needed for the present invention, however, a small cold reduction of 30% or less may be employed prior to the strip anneal or the strip may be hot reduced by up to 50% or more to an appropriate thickness<br>
When equipment and conditions permit, the starting hot processed strip preferably is annealed at 750-1150°C for a time of up to 10 minutes and more preferably at 1025-1100°C for 10-30 seconds to provide the desired microstructure prior to the first cold reduction to the intermediate strip thickness Carbon loss during annealing may require an appropriate adjustment in the melt composition to maintain the desired phase balance after completing the anneal In the present invention, carbon loss during annealing is affected when percentages of silicon and chromium provided is changed, when the thickness of the starting strip is changed and/or when the oxidizing potential of the annealing atmosphere and the time and temperature of annealing is changed In the present invention, the annealed strip is subjected to ambient air cooling The process of cooling after annealing is not critical and it is believed the preferred austenite decomposition reaction would provide carbon saturated femte and/or pearlite and that the formation of a high volume fraction of martensite or retained austenite is undesirable An alternative to air cooling would be to cool the steel slowly, such as would be provided by ambient air cooling, to a temperature less than 650°C and, more preferably, to a temperature less than 500°C followed by rapid cooling, such as would be provided by water quenching, to a temperature less than I00°C<br>
Following cold rolling to an intermediate thickness, the steel strip is subjected to an annealing step preceding any subsequent stage of cold rolling For example, if the steel is cold reduced three times, an intermediate anneal would be required between each of the first and second cold reductions and the second and third cold reductions The purpose of this step is to provide a microstructure and texture appropriate to any subsequent cold reduction Generally, such intermediate anneals are conducted under conditions which recrystallize the cold rolled material, cause the carbon present in the prior austenite to decompose into carbon-saturated ferrite while the cooling process after intermediate annealing is conducted under conditions conducive to accelerated austenite decomposition forming a microstructure of fine iron carbide precipitates in a femte matrix having less than 1 vol % of martensite and/or retained austenite. As such, the intermediate anneal can be conducted over a relatively wide temperature range of 800-1150°C for 3 seconds up to 10 minutes Preferably, the intermediate anneal can be conducted using annealing temperatures in the range of from 900-1100°C and more preferably from 915-950°C for_5=30-seeonds with cooling conducive to desired austenite decomposition reactions "After intermediate annealing, the strip is slowly cooled from the soak temperature, generally above 800°C, preferably 925°C, down to a temperature of about 650°C, preferably to about 550°C By<br><br>
1 2<br>
slow cooling is meant a rate of no greater than 10°C. preferably no greater than 5°C per second Thereafter, the strip is rapidly cooled down to about 315°C, at which point the strip can be water quenched to complete the rapid cooling By rapidly cooling is meant a rate of at least 23°C per second, preferably at least 50°C per second<br>
The amount of cold reduction taken in the first cold reduction to the intermediate strip thickness and second cold reduction to the final strip thickness in the process of the present invention is dependent upon the initial and final strip thicknesses It has been determined that a wide range of final thicknesses can be produced provided that the proper cold reductions are employed Regular grain oriented electrical steels have been produced in thicknesses of from 0 18-0 35 mm in the trials using the two cold reductions of the present invention The reductions required can be determined by experimentation wherein the magnetic properties, particularly the quality of the cube-on-edge orientation, are determined by cold reducing strips of various final thicknesses Excellent magnetic properties have been achieved at standard product thicknesses of 0 18 mm, 0 21 mm, 0 26 mm and 0 29 mm and 0 35 mm using a hot processed strip of 2 03-2 13 mm thickness and subjected to a first cold reduction to intermediate thicknesses of 0 56 mm, 0 58 mm, 0 61 mm, 0 66 mm and 0 81 mm, respectively In general, the preferred % reduction in a first cold reduction can be expressed by ln(a/b) &gt; 0 8, preferably/3 1 2, where a is the thickness of the hot processed strip and b is the intermediate thickness of the strip The preferred reduction in the second cold reduction can be expressed by cI/2ln(b/c) = 0 48 where c is the final thickness of the strip, all thicknesses in mm<br>
After the cold reduction to final thickness is completed, the steel is annealed in a mildly oxidizing atmosphere to reduce the carbon to an amount which minimizes magnetic aging, typically less than 0 003% The temperature of this anneal preferably is at least 800°C, more preferably at least 830°C and the atmosphere may be wet hydrogen-bearing atmosphere such as pure hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen In addition, the decarbunzation anneal prepares the steel for the formation of a forsterite, or "mill glass", coating in the high temperature final anneai by reaction of the surface oxide skin and the magnesium oxide (MgO) annealing separator coating In the present invention, it is preferred the silicon and chromium content is appropriate to insure that the decarburized electrical steel strip is completely ferritic prior to the high temperature annealing step wherein the cube-on-edge orientation is finally developed<br>
The final high temperature anneal is needed to develop the cube-on-edge grain orientation Typically, the steel is heated to a soak temperature of at least 1100°C in a wet hydrogen atmosphere During heating, the (110)[001] nucler begin the process of secondary grain growth at a temperature of about 850°C and which is substantially completed by about 1100°C Typical annealing conditions used in the present invention employed heating rates of less than 80°C per hour up to 815°C and further heating at rates<br><br>
13<br>
of less than 50°C per hour, and, preferably, 25°C per hour or lower up to the completion of secondary grain growth Once secondary grain growth is complete, the heating rate is not as critical and may be increased until the desired soak temperature is attained wherein the material is held for a time of at least 5 hours, preferably at least 20 hours, for removal of the sulfur and/or selenium inhibitors and for removal of other impurities, such as nitrogen<br>

The magnetic permeability measured at 796 A/m and core losses measured at 1 5 T 60 Hz in Table IV show the magnetic properties obtained on Melts D through G of the present invention and Melt H of the prior art method compare favorably However, Melts I through K of the prior art which have chromium compositions significantly above 0 1% evidenced lower magnetic permeability and higher core losses The excellent results obtained on Melts E through G using a chromium composition of 0 33-0 34% is provided by the method of the present invention wherein the appropriate compositions of carbon, chromium, silicon and other elements incident to the method of steelmaking are properly balanced to provide superior permeability and low and very consistent core losses<br>

In the present invention, the compositions of carbon, silicon and chromium were appropriate to provide the desired characteristics needed for vigorous secondary grain growth and excellent magnetic quality<br>
Example 4<br>
Two melts having very low carbon compositions of the prior art and the present invention are shown in Table VII The melt of the present invention contained 3 15% silicon and 0 3% chromium with a balance of iron and normal residual elements such as boron of 0 0005% or less, molybdenum of 0 06% or less, nickel of 0 15% or less, phosphorus of 0 020% or less, and aluminum of 0 005% or less which provided a composition of volume resistivity (p) of about 50 µO -cm The austemte volume fraction (? 1150°c) of prior art melt P was less than 2% and the austenite volume fraction of melt Q of this invention was about 5 6 %<br><br>
Both melts were processed in accordance with the procedures of Example 2 with the following exceptions Melt Q was processed to a final thickness of 0 26 mm using an intermediate thickness of 0 66 mm The composition of carbon in the melts was lower than typical of the prior art; however, Melt Q of the present invention is provided with compositions of silicon and chromium appropriate for vigorous secondary grain growth Melt P had low austenite percentage which is not conducive to the type of stable secondary grain growth needed to achieve a high quality cube-on-edge orientation As a result. Melt P was processed to a less critical final thickness of 0 35 mm using an intermediate thickness of 0 8 mm The resulting magnetic quality obtained in these trials is summarized in Table VIII<br><br>
17<br><br>
The magnetic permeability measured at 796 A/m and core loss measured at 1 5 T 60 Hz in Table VIII show that excellent magnetic properties with Melt Q of the present invention in spite of the low percentage of carbon while Melt P of the prior art produced marginal magnetic properties as would be expected from a grain oriented electrical steel of the prior art methods having very low carbon compositions<br>
Example 5<br>
Trials of a grain oriented electrical steel of the prior art were conducted to further increase the volume resistivity to above 53 µO -cm by raising the silicon to a composition above 3 5% However, the carbon composition needed to provide the necessary amount of austenite before cold rolling resulted in a thinner surface isomorphic layer and, thereby, less vigorous secondary gram growth Table IX summarizes the melt, chemistries and microstructural results from these prior art melts. Melts R and S of the prior art method were processed to a final thickness of 0 21 mm in accordance with the procedures of Example 2 and produced inconsistent and mediocre magnetic quality with magnetic permeability at H=796 A/m ranging from 1799-1831 and 15 T 60 Hz core losses ranging from 0 87-0 9. W/kg In these trials, the process was evidencing increasingly unstable secondary grain growth believed to have resulted from the very thin isomorphic layer thikness Further the mechanical properties were degraded, reflected in poorer toughness and a higher ductile-to-brittle transition temperature<br><br>
It is believed that the alloy composition of the present invention can provide a gram orented electrical, steel with a high level of volume resistivity and stable secondary grain growth owing to the provision of an appropriately thick isomorphic layer with an<br><br>
I 8<br>
appropriate austenite volume fraction It is further believed the grain oriented electrical steel of the present invention would also provide superior physical properties<br>
The preferred embodiments discussed herein have demonstrated a grain oriented electrical steel with low core losses can be made using the chromium-silicon alloy of the present invention and at least two cold reductions to provide a consistent and excellent composition of magnetic quality comparing favorably with the silicon-iron alloys of the prior art The present invention may also employ a strip which has been produced using methods such as ingot casting, thick slab casting, thin slab casting, strip casting or other methods of compact strip production<br>
It will be understood various modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of it Therefore, the limits of the invention should be determined from the appended claims<br><br>
