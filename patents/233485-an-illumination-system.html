				<td>ILLUMINATION SYSTEM AND PROJECTOR ADOPTING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an illumination system and a projector adopting the same, and more particularly, to an illumination system which can realize a color image without a color wheel by using a light emitting device or light emitting device array, and a projector adopting the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a conventional projector includes a light source 100, a first relay lens 102 for condensing a light beam emitted from the light source 100, a color wheel for splitting an incident light beam into three light beams of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors, a fly eye lens 107 for making the light beam passing through the color wheel 105 uniform, a second relay lens 110 for condensing the light beam passing through the fly eye lens 107, a display device 112 for forming a color image from the R,G and B color beams which are sequentially incident after passing through the color wheel 105, and a projection lens unit 115 for magnifying the image formed by the display device 112 and projecting the magnified image onto a screen 118.<br>
A xenon lamp, a metal-halide lamp, or a UHP lamp is used as the light source 100.   These lamps emit excess infrared and ultraviolet rays.   Accordingly, a lot of heat is generated, and a cooling fan is necessary.   However, the cooling fan is a source of noise.   Also, since the spectrum of the light source lamp is widely distributed across the entire wavelength spectrum, due to a narrow color gamut, the selection of color is limited, color purity is inferior, and the life span is short, making stable use of the lamp impossible.<br>
In the conventional single panel projector, to realize a color image, the color wheel 105 is rotated by a driving motor (not shown) at a high speed so that R, G and B color light beams are sequentially incident onto the display device 112.   However, since R, G and B color filters are equally arranged over the entire surface of the color wheel 105, and the filters are used one by one during the rotation of the color wheel 105, according to a response speed of the display device 112, 2/3 of light is lost. Also, since a gap of a predetermined width separates neighboring color filters for preferable generation of color, light is lost at this portion.<br><br>
Since the color wheel 105 rotates at a high speed, noise is generated.   Also, the mechanical movement of the driving motor has a bad effect on stability, and, due to mechanical limits in the driving motor, it is difficult to obtain speeds past a certain point, and a color breakup phenomenon occurs.   Further, since the color wheel is very expensive, the manufacturing cost rises.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an illumination system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes at least one light emitting device or light emitting device array 10 for emitting a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, holographic optical elements 18 designed to minimize the cross section of the light beam emitted from the light emitting device or light emitting device array 10, and an optical path changing unit 30 for changing an optical path by selectively transmitting or reflecting the light beam passing through the holographic optical elements 18.<br>
The light emitting device 10 can be formed of one of an LED (light emitting diode), an LD (laser diode), an organic EL (electro luminescent), and an FED (field<br><br>
emission display).   Also, at least one light emitting device can be arranged in an array.<br>
The light emitting device or light emitting device array 10 can be formed of first, second, and third light emitting devices or light emitting arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c, each emitting a light beam having a different wavelength.   Also, the light emitting device arrays can further be provided in multiple layers.    For example, another light emitting device array 20 can be provided under the light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c.<br>
The holographic optical elements 18 and 28 are symmetrically arranged between the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20.   The holographic optical elements 18 and 28 are designed such that as the light beams emitted from the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20 are reflected, their cross sections are minimized. That is, as shown in FIG. 3, when the light beams emitted from the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20 are reflected by the holographic optical elements 18 and 28, the overall cross section of the light beams reflected by the holographic optical elements 18 and 28 is less than the overall cross section of the light beams incident on the holographic optical elements 18 and 28.   Thus, the volume of the illumination system can be reduced for the same amount of light, and light loss can be reduced.<br>
Here, parallel light beam forming unit 15 and 25, such as a collimating lens array or a Fresnel lens array, which make the light beam emitted from the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20 into a parallel light beam, are further provided between the light emitting device array 10 and the holographic optical element 18 and between the light emitting device arrays 20 and the holographic optical element 28.    In the present embodiment, a collimating lens array is used as the parallel light beam forming unit 15 and 25.<br>
Since the light emitting arrays 10 and 20 are symmetrically arranged, including the collimating lens arrays 15 and 25 and the holographic optical elements 18 and 28, the optical functions of the light emitting arrays 10 and 20 are the same. Thus, only the light emitting device array 10 will be described.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 4, the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c can be arranged in a line.   The light beam emitted from each of the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c passes through the collimating lens array 15 and the holographic optical element 18 and proceeds towards the<br><br>
optical path changing unit 30.    The optical path changing unit 30 selectively transmits or reflects an incident light beam to make the incident light beams input along different optical paths proceed along the same optical path.   The optical path changing unit 30 may include first, second, and third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c which reflect or transmit according to the wavelength of the light beam emitted from each of the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c.   For example, light beams having red (R), green (G), and blue (B) wavelengths can be emitted from the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c, respectively.<br>
The first dichroic filter 30a reflects an R light beam only and transmits the other light beams having G and B wavelengths.   The second dichroic filter 30b reflects a G light beam only and transmits the other light beams having R and B wavelengths.   The third dichroic filter 30c reflects a B light beam only and transmits the other light beams having R and G wavelengths.   Thus, when the R light beam emitted from the first light emitting device array 10a is incident on the first dichroic filter 30a via the collimating lens array 15 and the holographic optical element 18, the light beam is reflected by the first dichroic filter 30a, and proceeds in the direction indicated by an arrow A shown in FIG. 4.   Also, when the G light beam emitted from the second light emitting device array 10b is incident on the second dichroic filter 30b via the collimating lens array 15 and the holographic optical element 18, the light beam is reflected by the second dichroic filter 30b and passes through the first dichroic filter 30a, to proceed in the direction A.   When the B light beam emitted from the third light emitting device array 10c is incident on the third dichroic filter 30c via the collimating lens array 15 and the holographic optical element 18, the light beam is reflected by the third dichroic filter 30c and passes through the second and first dichroic filters 30b and 30a, to proceed in the direction A.   As a result, the R, G, and B color light beams, incident on different optical paths, proceed along the same optical path.<br>
Alternatively, a cholesteric band modulation filter 35, which can selectively reflect or transmit according to the polarization direction of incident light, can be used as the optical path changing unit, as shown in FIG. 5.   The cholesteric band modulation filter 35 can change the optical path of a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, for example, by reflecting a light beam of right circular polarization and transmitting a light beam of left circular polarization, or by<br><br>
transmitting a light beam of right circular polarization and reflecting a light beam of left circular polarization.   The cholesteric band modulation filter 35 can include first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c which selectively transmit or reflect according to the direction of circular polarization of an R light beam, a G light beam, and a B light beam, respectively.<br>
To improve the efficiency of light by using both light beams of right circular polarization and left circular polarization, each of the first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c includes a first mirror surface<br>
37	for reflecting a light beam of right circular polarization and transmitting a light<br>
beam of left circular polarization, of the wavelength corresponding to the respective<br>
filter, and a second mirror surface 38 for transmitting a light beam of right circular<br>
polarization and reflecting a light beam of left circular polarization, which are<br>
appropriately arranged.    Here, the light beam of right circular polarization and the<br>
light beam of left circular polarization are indicated by + and -, respectively.    For<br>
example, R+ denotes an R light beam of right circular polarization while R- denotes<br>
an R light beam of left circular polarization.<br>
The light beams emitted from the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c and passing through the collimating lens array 15 and the holographic optical element 18 proceed toward the first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c, respectively.   In each of the first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c, the first and second mirror surfaces 37 and 38 are provided diagonally with respect to the direction in which the light beam is input.<br>
In the case of the path of the R light beam, when the light beam of right circular polarization (R+) of the R light beam reflected from the holographic optical element 18 first meets the first mirror surface 37, the light beam is reflected by the first mirror surface 37.   Then, when that light beam meets the second mirror surface<br>
38	in its path, the light beam is transmitted, to proceed in a direction indicated by an<br>
arrow A' of FIG. 5.    In the meantime, when the light beam first meets the second<br>
mirror surface 38, the light beam passes through the second mirror surface 38 and<br>
reflected by the first mirror surface 37, to proceed in the direction A'.    Conversely,<br>
when the light beam of left circular polarization (R-) of the R light beam reflected by<br>
the holographic optical element 18 first meets the first mirror surface 37, the light<br>
beam passes through the first mirror surface 37.   Then, when that light beam meets<br><br>
the second mirror surface 38 in its path, the light beam is reflected by the second mirror surface 38 to proceed in the direction A'.    In the meantime, when the light beam first meets the second mirror surface 38, the light beam is reflected by the second mirror surface 38 to proceed in the direction A'.<br>
The above process is equivalently applied to the right circular polarization G+ and the left circular polarization G- of the G light beam, and to the right circular polarization B+ and the left circular polarization B- of the B light beam, so that all the light beams finally proceed in the same direction A'.    The first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c each selectively transmit or reflect light beams having the wavelength corresponding to that filter, but transmit all light beams having different wavelengths, regardless of the direction of polarization. Thus, since all the light beams of right circular polarization and the left circular polarization can be used effectively, the efficient of light is very high.<br>
FIG. 6 shows an illumination system according to yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 6, an illumination system according to yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention includes first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c, each for emitting a light beam having a different wavelength, parallel light beam forming units 45a, 45b, and 45c such as first, second, and third collimating lens arrays or a Fresnel lens array, for making each of the light beams emitted from the first, second, and third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c parallel, first, second, and third holographic optical elements 48a, 48b, and 48cfor reflecting an incident light beam which has passed through the parallel light beam forming units 45a, 45b, and 45c while reducing the cross section of that light beam, and an optical path changing unit for changing the path of light beams input from different directions.<br>
Here, a fourth light emitting device array 50a, a fourth collimating lens array 55a, and a fourth holographic optical element 58a can further be provided symmetrical to the first light emitting device array 40a, the first collimating lens array 45a, and the first holographic optical element 48a, respectively.    Of course, the above can be equally applied to the second light emitting device array 40b and the third light emitting device array 40c.   That is, fifth and sixth light emitting device arrays 50b and 50c, fifth and sixth collimating lens arrays 55b and 55c, and fifth and sixth holographic optical elements 58b and 58c can further be provided symmetrical to the second and third light emitting device arrays 40b and 40c, the second and<br><br>
third collimating lens arrays 45b and 45c, and the second and third holographic optical elements 48b and 48c, respectively.    By forming the light emitting device array in multiple layers, the maximum light amount can be produced in the minimum space.   Since the operation of the first through third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c is the same as the fourth through sixth light emitting device arrays 50a, 50b, and 50c, the operation of the first through third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c only will be described.<br>
The optical path changing unit can be formed of an X prism 60 or an X-type dichroic filter film.   The first through third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c are arranged to be separated by a predetermined angle with respect to the X prism 60.   The X prism 60 has first, second, and third incident surfaces 61, 62, and 63 disposed to face the respective holographic optical elements 48a, 48b, and 48c, so that the light beams reflected by the first, second, and third holographic optical elements 48a, 48b, and 48c can be received, and an exit surface 64.   Also, the X prism 60 has a third mirror surface 60a which reflects a light beam incident on the first incident surface 61 and transmits light beams incident on the second and third incident surfaces 62 and 63, and a fourth mirror surface 60b which reflects a light beam incident on the third incident surface 63 and transmits light beams incident on the first and second mirror surfaces 61 and 62.   The third and fourth mirror surfaces 60a and 60b cross each other like a letter X to selectively transmit or reflect incident light beams according to the wavelength thereof.    For example, the third mirror surface 60a reflects the R light beam and transmits the other light beams having G and B wavelengths.   The fourth mirror surface 60b reflects the B light beam and transmits the other light beams having R and G wavelengths.<br>
FIG. 7 is a plan view of the system illustrated in FIG. 6.    Referring to FIG. 7, the R, G, and B light beams emitted from the first through third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c and passing through the first through third holographic optical elements 48a, 48b, and 48c are incident on the corresponding first through third incident surfaces 61, 62, and 63 of the X prism 60.   The R, G, and B light beams input along different paths are transmitted or reflected by the third and fourth mirror surfaces 60a and 60b, to exit in the same direction passing through the exit surface 64.<br><br>
The light emitting device array according to the above preferred embodiments can be arranged in various ways, and the optical path changing units 30, 35, and 60 can be selected suitably for the arrangement.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a projector adopting the above light emitting device illumination system.   A projector adopting a light emitting device illumination system according to the present invention, as shown in FIG. 8, includes an illumination system for emitting a light beam, a display device 75 for forming an image using the R, G, and B light beams emitted from the illumination system, and a projection lens unit 77 for projecting the image formed by the display device 75 onto the screen 80.   The illumination system includes a plurality of the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20 formed of at least one light emitting device for emitting a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, holographic optical elements 18 and 28 designed to reflect the light beam emitted from the light emitting device arrays 10 and 20 while minimizing its cross section, and the optical path changing unit 30 for changing the optical path by selectively transmitting or reflecting the light beams incident from the holographic optical elements 18 and 28.<br>
The light emitting device array 10 is formed of the first through third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c, each emitting R, G, or B light beams.   To secure a sufficient light amount, one or more layers of the light emitting device array 20 having the same structure can further be provided symmetrically.   When the first through third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c are arranged in a line, the R, G, and B light beams reflected by the holographic optical element 18 exit in the same direction, parallel to one another.   The optical path changing unit 30 includes the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c to change the paths of the R, G, and B light beams by selectively transmitting or reflecting the light beams according to their wavelength.<br>
A fly eye lens 65, for uniformly distributing the R, G, and B light beams output in the same direction from the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c, and a relay lens 70 for condensing the light beam toward the display device 75, can further be provided.    Here, a color image is formed by the display device 75 using the R, G, and B light beams.   The display device 75 may be a mobile mirror apparatus for realizing a color image by an on/off switching action of micromirrors, or an LCD device for realizing a color image by modulating the polarization of an incident light beam.<br><br>
Here, in the above description, the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c are used as the optical path changing unit 30.    However, the cholesteric band modulation filter 35 for transmitting or reflecting the incident light beam according to its direction of circular polarization can also be used.<br>
Also, the X prism 60 or the X type dichroic filter can be used, to change the optical path of the R, G, and B light beams input from different directions to exit in the same direction by reflecting or transmitting the incident light beam according to their wavelength.    Here, the first through third light emitting device arrays 40a, 40b, and 40c are arranged to be separated by a predetermined angle with respect to the X prism 60 or the X type dichroic filter, as shown in FIG. 7.   The illumination system having the above structure can replace the illumination system including the first through third light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c and the dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c.<br>
The R, G, and B light beams emitted from the above illumination system are incident on the display device 75 via the fly eye lens 65 and the relay lens 70 to form a color image.   The color image is magnified by the projection lens unit 77 and projected onto the screen 80.<br>
As described above, since the light emitting device illumination according to the present invention emits a light beam having a narrow spectrum of a desired wavelength, color purity is improved and a color gamut having a wider distribution can be achieved.   Also, as the cross section of the light beam emitted by the holographic optical element is minimized, the illumination system is made compact and loss of light can be reduced.   Further, compared to the conventional lamp light source, less heat is generated and the life span is extended.   Also, in the projector adopting the light emitting device illumination system according to the present invention, since time sequential driving by the light emitting device illumination system is possible, the color wheel is not needed.   Also, since the light beam can be switched faster than the possible rotation speed of the color wheel, a high frame rate can be realized and power consumption can be reduced.   Therefore, the projector adopting the light emitting device illumination system according to the present invention can provide an image having high visibility and quality.<br><br><br><br><br>
