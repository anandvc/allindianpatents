Method and Device for Protecting Tobacco<br>
The invention relates to a method of protecting tobacco tbacco bales or other tobacco products Iron harmful organisms during harvesting, drying, curing, transport and storage. The invention further relates to a device for carrying out the method.<br>
Tobacco is a valuable cash crop, and is the most widely grown non-food crop in the world.<br>
After harvesting, the tobacco leaves are subjected to the stages of curing, fermenting and aging as part of the process of producing tobaccos suitable for smoking or chewing by hu¬mans. All of these stages require extended storage periods, in the last case up to several years. During these storage periods, the tobacco leaves have to be protected from pests, specifically from insect pests <br>
Nevertheless, contamination of the tobacco with pesticides has to be avoided to create no additional health hazards for the human consumers.<br>
Currently, a common method of pest control in the storage of tobacco is the use of gaseous pesticides, specifically methyl bromide and phosphin (PH3). However, the use of methyl bromide is not desirable from an ecological point of view as this substance is ozone deplet¬ing. Phosphine, on the other hand, is highly toxic and - if not properly handled - is a poten¬tial health hazard for the workers engaged in the production of tobacco.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuous demand to provide new methods for protecting tobacco leaves from harmful organisms, while avoiding pesticide residues in the tobacco and health<br>
hazards for the workers.<br>
It has now been found that this demand can be met by providing a method for protecting tobacco from harmful organisms during storage comprising the step of covering the to¬bacco with a material which has a protective activity against the harmful organisms.<br>
WO 2005/064072 discloses a composition for the impregnation of fibers, fabrics and net¬tings imparting a protective activity against pests, however, the use of such a composition for protecting tobacco is not contemplated.<br><br>
According to the invention, tobacco can be protected from harmful organisms in an easy and efficient way without health hazard to workers and without causing residues of pesti¬cides in the tobacco products.<br>
In a further aspect ot ttie invention there is provided the use of a material which has a pro¬tective activity against harmful organisms for protecting tobacco.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a device for protecting tobacco from harmful organisms comprising a device for storing the tobacco and a material which has a protective activity against harmful organisms, for covering the tobacco.<br>
The term "tobacco" as used herein means tobacco plants or parts thereof in any stage after and during harvesting, specifically in the stages of curing, fermentation and aging.<br>
The terms "protection" or "protecting" as used herein means a controlling or repelling ac¬tion.<br>
The term "harmful organism" as used herein means pests, specifically arthropod pests, including insects and arachnids, and harmful micro-organisms, specifically fungi including spores, microbes and viruses.<br>
The term "covering" as used herein means that the fabric or netting forms a physical barrier between the tobacco to be protected and the harmful organism, but does not imply that the tobacco is in physical contact with the cover materiat.<br>
The material is preferably a non-rigid material. It is preferably a textile material or plastics material selected from the group consisting of yarn, fibers, fabric, knitgoods, nonwovens, netting material, foils, tarpaulins and coatings. The netting material may be prepared by any method known in the art, for example by circular knitting or warp knitting, or by sewing parts of a netting to obtain the desired nettings.<br>
The textile material or plastics material may be made form a variety of natural and synthetic fibers, also as textile blends in woven or non-woven form, as knit goods, yarns or fibers. Natural fibers are for example cotton, wool, silk or bast fibers, like jute, linen, ramie, hemp and kenaf. Synthetic fibers are for example polyamides, polyesters, polyacryl nitriles, Doly-<br><br>
olefines, for example polypropylene or polyethylene, Teflon, and mixtures of fibers, for ex¬ample mixtures of synthetic and natural fibers. Polyamides, potyolefins and polyesters are preferred. Polyethylene terephthalate is especially preferred.<br>
The term material also includes non-textile substrates such as coatings, leathers, synthetic adaptions of leather, flocked fabrics, sheetings, foils, perforated foils and packaging male-rial.<br>
Further, the term material includes cellulose-containing materials e.g. cotton materials such as garment or cotton nets and also wooden materials such a&amp; bouses, trees, board fences, or sleepers and also paper.<br>
Preferably, the material is a textile material or plastics material, e.g. polypropylene, poly¬ethylene, polyester or polyamide.<br>
Preferably the textile material is a netting.<br>
Suitable mesh sizes are well known to those skilled In the art and may be chosen in view of the size of the prevailing pests. While the mesh size should be small enough to present an obstacle to the pest it is usually preferred to have an exchange of air and humidity.<br>
Suitable mesh sizes are in the range of 5 x 5 mm, preferably 2.5 x 2.5 mm, more preferred 1.5 X 1.5 mm as an upper limit and 0.1 x 0.1 mm, preferably 0.25 x 0.25 mm, more pre¬ferred 0.5 X 0,5 mm, in particular 0.75 x 0.75 mm as a lower limit. In the case of very small pests a wide-meshed woven fabric may be preferred as a textile material.<br>
More preferred are nettings made from polyester, especially polyethylene terephthalate. In a further preferred embodiment the material is a cellulose containing material.<br>
Preferably, the material is treated with a composition comprising a pesticide, however, the invention is not limited to such embodiments. E.g., the pesticide can also be incorporated into a fiber during the production of the fiber.<br>
Such materials show good results in controlling the pests and provide long lasting protec¬tion to the stored tobacco.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pesticide is incorporated into the material (e.g. into the plastics matrix) or applied to the surface of the material or both.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the material is treated with a composition comprising;<br>

Such processing includes the curing of tobacco after harvesting, specifically the yellowing, leaf drying and stem drying stage.<br>
It includes any type of curing, such as air-curing, sun-curing, fire-curing and, in particular, flue-curing. In the flue-curing, the method can be used in direct-fired systems as indirect fired systems, working, e.g., with heat exchangers.<br>
The method according to the invention is further useful in the fermenting and aging steps of tobacco processing. Depending on the kind and quality of the final tobacco product, these steps range from a couple of days to several years - during which the tobacco has to be protected from pests.<br>
Accordingly, the method according to the invention is useful in the production of any kind of tobacco product for human consumption, such as cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarette tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, snuff, gutka and creamy snuff.<br>
The device according to the invention comprises means for spreading out the tobacco leaves, such as a rack or an open framework where sticks of tied leaves or the whole stalk is hung, a material, which has protective activity against harmful organism, and which cov¬ers the tobacco to be protected, and, optionally means for attaching the material to the means for spreading out the tobacco.<br>
The material is preferably a net, because this does not disturb the drying or curing process - which requires an exchange of air, humidity and heat between the tobacco and its envi¬ronment - while it still affords good protection against pests.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the use of nets leads to a good protection even in the case of fungal diseases.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples without limiting it thereby.<br>

I(. Examples of use<br>
a)	Preparation of long-lasting insecticidai nets (LLINs)<br>
The insecticidai treatment was performed with aqueous dispersions according to examples A1 - A17 on commercially available white polyester netting material (fiber titer 75 denier, 156 mesh, weight 28-32 g/m^) without prior washing. The aqueous treatment baths were prepared by mixing the aqueous dispersions with commercially available emulsions of in¬secticide and/or repellent, setting pH with buffer solutions and adding a fixative (if needed). The concentrations of the treatment baths were adjusted according to the liquor uptake possible (LU between 60 and 100 %). The treatment baths were applied by using a padder-stenter equipment on a laboratory scale {Mathis AG, Switzerland). The netting material is fully immersed into the treatment bath and excess liquor is removed by passing it through cylinders which move in counter-direction. By choosing a defined distance between these cylinders (and thus a defined pressure) the liquor uptake can be controlled. The liquor up¬take is measured by weighing an impregnated piece of netting and subtracting the weight of the dry, untreated netting and is given as % weight of liquor on weight of netting. The drying/curing step was performed in a laboratory stenter which allows to control the tem¬perature and time of the treatment.<br>
b)	Testing Methodologies<br>
Limited Forced Exposure Assay:<br>
Aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidai nets (LLINs, 200 mg ai/m^) were cut to fit 150 X 25 mm Petri dishes. LLINs were placed on the bottom of the dishes and 10 adult cigarette beetles, Lasioderma serricome, were introduced into each dish onto the<br><br>
nets. Beetles were exposed to the nets for 10, 30, or 60 minutes and the nets were then removed. Mortality/knockdown was evaluated at the time of net removal. Ten replicates were performed per treatment.<br>
Behavioral Assay:<br>
Cardboard shipping tubers (457 mm pieces of 76 mm diameter) were covered on one end with aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN, 200 mg ai/m^), which was secured with a rubber band and electrical tape. The end of the tube with the LLIN was attached to a clear plastic cup (76 mm diameter x 89 mm height) with electrical tape filled with 20.0 g of toasted oat cereal to serve as a food source. Ten adutt tobacco moths, Ephestia elutella, (Table 3) or ten adult cigarette beetles, Lasiodeima serricorne, (Table 2) were introduced into the tubes on the opposite end of the LLIN and food source. The opposite (open) end of each tube was then sealed. Location and mortality of the moths/beetles were evaluated at 1 and 2 days (E elutella) or 1 and 4 days (L serricorne) after treatment (DAT). Ten replications were performed per trea^ent with E..elutella and eight replications were performed per treatment with L serricorne-<br>
c)      Results<br>
1. Aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLlNs) were efficacious against cigarette beetles, resulting in 87% knockdown + mortality after 10 minutes ex¬posure and 100% mortality after 60 minutes exposure in a forced exposure assay (Ta¬ble 1, Figures 1 and 2). Knocked down beetles were un^le to recover:<br><br>

3. LLiNs caused significantly greater mortality of tobacco moths (89 % at 1 DAT and 94 % at 2 DAT) compared to the untreated net in a behavioral assay where the moths had to pass through the net to reach a food/light source. Very few moths able to pass through the untreated net or LLIN, indicating utility of (2 mm x 2 mm) LLINs for use as a physical and chemical barrier for protection of stored tobacco from tobacco moth in¬festations (Table 3, Figure 4):<br>

AS ORIGINALLY FILED<br>
Method and Device for Protecting Tobacco<br>
The invention relates to a method of protecting tobacco tbacco bales or other tobacco products Iron harmful organisms during harvesting, drying, curing, transport and storage. The invention further relates to a device for carrying out the method.<br>
Tobacco is a valuable cash crop, and is the most widely grown non-food crop in the world.<br>
After harvesting, the tobacco leaves are subjected to the stages of curing, fermenting and aging as part of the process of producing tobaccos suitable for smoking or chewing by hu¬mans. All of these stages require extended storage periods, in the last case up to several years. During these storage periods, the tobacco leaves have to be protected from pests, specifically from insect pests <br>
Nevertheless, contamination of the tobacco with pesticides has to be avoided to create no additional health hazards for the human consumers.<br>
Currently, a common method of pest control in the storage of tobacco is the use of gaseous pesticides, specifically methyl bromide and phosphin (PH3). However, the use of methyl bromide is not desirable from an ecological point of view as this substance is ozone deplet¬ing. Phosphine, on the other hand, is highly toxic and - if not properly handled - is a poten¬tial health hazard for the workers engaged in the production of tobacco.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuous demand to provide new methods for protecting tobacco leaves from harmful organisms, while avoiding pesticide residues in the tobacco and health<br>
hazards for the workers.<br>
It has now been found that this demand can be met by providing a method for protecting tobacco from harmful organisms during storage comprising the step of covering the to¬bacco with a material which has a protective activity against the harmful organisms.<br>
WO 2005/064072 discloses a composition for the impregnation of fibers, fabrics and net¬tings imparting a protective activity against pests, however, the use of such a composition for protecting tobacco is not contemplated.<br><br>
According to the invention, tobacco can be protected from harmful organisms in an easy and efficient way without health hazard to workers and without causing residues of pesti¬cides in the tobacco products.<br>
In a further aspect ot ttie invention there is provided the use of a material which has a pro¬tective activity against harmful organisms for protecting tobacco.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a device for protecting tobacco from harmful organisms comprising a device for storing the tobacco and a material which has a protective activity against harmful organisms, for covering the tobacco.<br>

The aqueous formulation or the melt preferably comprises the pesticidal composition, which is preferably employed in form of an aqueous formulation.<br>
In the context of the invention "impregnation" is a process for applying the pesticidal com¬position. This process may include a process for curing the applied pestidical composition to achieve a coating onto the material, if desired. An "impregnated material" is a material onto which the pesticidal composition is applied. The "impregnated material" may be coated by curing the applied pesticidal composition, it desired.<br>
The pesticidal composition may also be applied onto the material by transfer printing, Inkjet printing, a screen process, and powder printing.<br>
Details of the application of the pesticidal composition are well known to someone skilled in the art and are disclosed, e.g.. in WO 2005/064072.<br>
The method according to the invention is useful for protecting tobacco, tobacco bales or other tobacco products. It can be used for protecting any kind of tobacco, such as e.g. tobacco produced from Nicotiana rostica and Nicotiana tabacum, specifically dark tobacco, bright tobacco, burley tobacco, shade tobacco and Perique.<br>
The method is useful for protecting, the tobacco from any kind of pests and disease en¬countered in the transport and storage of tobacco, specifically from storage pests, like bugs, beetles and moths, mites, mice and tobacco diseases.<br>
Such pests include:<br>
Cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), tobacco moth (Ephespha elutella), confused flour beetle (Tribolium confusum), red flour beetle {Tribolium castaneum), saw-toothed grain beetle {Oryzaephilus surinamensis), yellow meal worm (Tenebrio molitor), lesser meal worm (Alphitobius diaperinus), granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius), lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae), angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella), Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella), drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum), cadelle beetle (Tenebroides mauritanicus), long¬headed flour beetle (Latheticus orizae), dark mealworm (Tenebrio obscurus), denmestid beetles such as: black carpet beetle, larder beetle, wardrobe beetle, odd beetle, hide bee¬tle, warehouse beetle, spider beetles, weevils, especially the bean weevil, grain mite, black<br><br>
flour beetle, flat grain beetles, fruit flies, vinegar flies, rusty grain beetle, hairy fungus bee¬tle, flat grain beetle, sap beetles, deathwatch beetles, darkling beetles, and fungus beetles.<br>
The method according to the invention is specifically useful for the control of the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), and the tobacco moth (Ephespha elutella), the two main pests in tobacco storage.<br>
The methods according to the invention can be applied in all stages and types of tobacco processing, where a storage period is required.<br>
Such processing includes the curing of tobacco after harvesting, specifically the yellowing, leaf drying and stem drying stage.<br>
It includes any type of curing, such as air-curing, sun-curing, fire-curing and, in particular, flue-curing. In the flue-curing, the method can be used in direct-fired systems as indirect fired systems, working, e.g., with heat exchangers.<br>
The method according to the invention is further useful in the fermenting and aging steps of tobacco processing. Depending on the kind and quality of the final tobacco product, these steps range from a couple of days to several years - during which the tobacco has to be protected from pests.<br>
Accordingly, the method according to the invention is useful in the production of any kind of tobacco product for human consumption, such as cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarette tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, snuff, gutka and creamy snuff.<br>
The device according to the invention comprises means for spreading out the tobacco leaves, such as a rack or an open framework where sticks of tied leaves or the whole stalk is hung, a material, which has protective activity against harmful organism, and which cov¬ers the tobacco to be protected, and, optionally means for attaching the material to the means for spreading out the tobacco.<br>
The material is preferably a net, because this does not disturb the drying or curing process - which requires an exchange of air, humidity and heat between the tobacco and its envi¬ronment - while it still affords good protection against pests.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the use of nets leads to a good protection even in the case of fungal diseases.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples without limiting it thereby.<br>

I(. Examples of use<br>
a)	Preparation of long-lasting insecticidai nets (LLINs)<br>
The insecticidai treatment was performed with aqueous dispersions according to examples A1 - A17 on commercially available white polyester netting material (fiber titer 75 denier, 156 mesh, weight 28-32 g/m^) without prior washing. The aqueous treatment baths were prepared by mixing the aqueous dispersions with commercially available emulsions of in¬secticide and/or repellent, setting pH with buffer solutions and adding a fixative (if needed). The concentrations of the treatment baths were adjusted according to the liquor uptake possible (LU between 60 and 100 %). The treatment baths were applied by using a padder-stenter equipment on a laboratory scale {Mathis AG, Switzerland). The netting material is fully immersed into the treatment bath and excess liquor is removed by passing it through cylinders which move in counter-direction. By choosing a defined distance between these cylinders (and thus a defined pressure) the liquor uptake can be controlled. The liquor up¬take is measured by weighing an impregnated piece of netting and subtracting the weight of the dry, untreated netting and is given as % weight of liquor on weight of netting. The drying/curing step was performed in a laboratory stenter which allows to control the tem¬perature and time of the treatment.<br>
b)	Testing Methodologies<br>
Limited Forced Exposure Assay:<br>
Aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidai nets (LLINs, 200 mg ai/m^) were cut to fit 150 X 25 mm Petri dishes. LLINs were placed on the bottom of the dishes and 10 adult cigarette beetles, Lasioderma serricome, were introduced into each dish onto the<br><br>
nets. Beetles were exposed to the nets for 10, 30, or 60 minutes and the nets were then removed. Mortality/knockdown was evaluated at the time of net removal. Ten replicates were performed per treatment.<br>
Behavioral Assay:<br>
Cardboard shipping tubers (457 mm pieces of 76 mm diameter) were covered on one end with aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN, 200 mg ai/m^), which was secured with a rubber band and electrical tape. The end of the tube with the LLIN was attached to a clear plastic cup (76 mm diameter x 89 mm height) with electrical tape filled with 20.0 g of toasted oat cereal to serve as a food source. Ten adutt tobacco moths, Ephestia elutella, (Table 3) or ten adult cigarette beetles, Lasiodeima serricorne, (Table 2) were introduced into the tubes on the opposite end of the LLIN and food source. The opposite (open) end of each tube was then sealed. Location and mortality of the moths/beetles were evaluated at 1 and 2 days (E elutella) or 1 and 4 days (L serricorne) after treatment (DAT). Ten replications were performed per trea^ent with E..elutella and eight replications were performed per treatment with L serricorne-<br>
c)      Results<br>
1. Aiphacypermethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLlNs) were efficacious against cigarette beetles, resulting in 87% knockdown + mortality after 10 minutes ex¬posure and 100% mortality after 60 minutes exposure in a forced exposure assay (Ta¬ble 1, Figures 1 and 2). Knocked down beetles were un^le to recover:<br><br>
Table 1 -<br>
Efficacy of alphacypermethrin-impregnated long-iasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) against<br>
cigarette beetles, Lasioderma serricorne. in a limited forced exposure assay<br><br><br><br>
2. LLlNs caused significantly greater mortality ot cigarette beetles (93% at 1 day after treatment (DAT) and 100% at 4 DAT) compared to the untreated net in a behavioral assay where the beetles had to pass through the net to reach a food/light source:<br>
Table 2.<br>
Efficacy of alphacypemiethrin-impregnated long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) against cigarette beetle, Lasioderma semcorne, adults in a behavioral assay<br><br><br><br>
3. LLiNs caused significantly greater mortality of tobacco moths (89 % at 1 DAT and 94 % at 2 DAT) compared to the untreated net in a behavioral assay where the moths had to pass through the net to reach a food/light source. Very few moths able to pass through the untreated net or LLIN, indicating utility of (2 mm x 2 mm) LLINs for use as a physical and chemical barrier for protection of stored tobacco from tobacco moth in¬festations (Table 3, Figure 4):<br>

4. LUNs caused significantly greater mortality of to cigarette beetles compared to the untreated net in a beliavioral assay wfiere the beetles had to pass through the net to reach a food/light source. No beetles were able to pass through the untreated net or LLIN, indicating utility of (1 mm x 1 mm) LLINs at different a.!, levels for use as a physical and chemical barrier for protection of stored tobacco cigarette beetle infesta¬tions (Table 4, Figure 5):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
