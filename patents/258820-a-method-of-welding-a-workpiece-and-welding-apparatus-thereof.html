10 FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the art of electric arc welding and more particularly to an<br>
improved short arc welding system, methods of welding with self-shielding flux cored arc welding<br>
(FCAW-S) electrodes, and the composition of the electrodes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
15 Presently, there are no conmiercial solutions or methods for semi-automatically,<br>
circumferentially, welding high strength pipes and pipelines with a gas-less or self-shielding welding<br>
process. This is because the traditional technologies used for gas-less or self-shielding welding<br>
" applications have in high strength welding applications.<br>
In using gas-less or self-shielding welding electrodes various chemicals are used in the electrode<br>
20 to react with the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere to keep these components out of the weld. These<br>
chemicals are used in such a quantity so as to sufficiently prevent the oxygen or nitrogen from<br>
deteriorating the weld quality. However, while these chemicals, such as titanium and aluminum, make<br>
the welds stronger, they also have the adverse effects of making the welds brittle. This brittleness<br>
prevents gas-less or self-shielding welding methods from being used in many high strength welding<br>
- 2 -<br>
25 applications, such as pipeline welding, in which it is often required that the weld strength be sufficient to<br>
satisfy the requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher.<br>
Further, although there exists methods for meeting these weld requirements using gas-shielded<br>
welding methods, these methods also have drawbacks which make them less than desirable. Namely,<br>
current methods and systems for welding high strength pipes and pipelines (along with other applications)<br>
30 using gas-shielding methods require costly and time consuming set ups to protect the welding area from<br>
the atmosphere and elements. This is particularly the case in pipeline applications, where the welds are<br>
g^ often taking place outside in difficult environmental conditions.<br>
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE<br>
The present invention involves using a short arc welding process employing a self-shielding cored<br>
35 electrode which is capable of satisfying the requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute (API)<br>
Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher. There is a synergistic relationship when combining the welding process<br>
and the flux cored electrode of the present invention. Thus, the present invention combines controlling<br>
the energy input along with the microstructure control of the weld metal deposited to achieve highstrength<br>
and toughness. Specifically, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention can achieve over<br>
40 550 MPa yield strength and 690 MPa tensile strength, and a Charpy V-Notch (CVN) toughness of over<br>
w 60 Joules at -20 degrees C.<br>
Short-circuit arc welding systems, techniques, and associated concepts, as well as pipe welding<br>
methods and apparatuses are generally set forth in the following United States patents, the contents of<br>

3<br>
The electric arc welding field uses a variety of welding processes between the end of a<br>
consumable advancing electrode and a workpiece, which workpiece may include two or more<br>
50 components to be welded together. An embodiment of the present invention relates to the short arc<br>
process where the advancing electrode is melted by the heat of the arc during a current pulse and then,<br>
after the molten metal forms into a ball by surface tension action, the molten metal ball is transferred to<br>
the workpiece by a short circuit action. The short circuit occurs when the advancing wire moves the ball<br>
I<br>
into contact with the molten metal puddle on the workpiece, which short is sensed by a plunge in the<br>
55 welding voltage. Thereafter, the short circuit is broken and the short arc welding process is repeated. The<br>
present invention is an improvement in short arc welding and is performed by using a power source where<br>
the profile of the welding waveform is controlled by a waveform generator operating a pulse width<br>
modulator of a high switching speed inverter, as disclosed in several patents by assignee,, such Â£is shown<br>
in Parks 4,866,247; Blankenship 5,278,390; and, Houston 6,472,634, each of which is hereby<br>
60 incorporated by reference. These three patents illustrate the type of high switching speed power source<br>
employed for practicing an exemplary embodiment of the present invention and are incorporated herein as<br>
background technology. A waveform of the waveform generator is stored in memory as a state table,<br>
which table is selected and outputted to the waveform generator in accordance with standard technology<br>
pioneered by The Lincoln Electric Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Such selection of a table for creating<br>
^ r 65 the waveform profile in the waveform generator is disclosed in several prior art patents, such as the<br>
previously mentioned Blankenship 5,278,390. Consequently, a power source used in practicing the<br>
present invention is now commonly known and constitutes background technology used in the present<br>
invention. An aspect of the short arc welding system of the present invention employs a circuit to<br>
determine the total energy of the melting pulse forming the molten metal ball of the advancing electrode,<br>
70 such as described in Parks 4,866,247. The total energy of the melting pulse is sensed by a watt meter<br>
having an integrated output over the time of the melting pulse. This technology is incorporated by<br>
reference herein since it is employed in one aspect of the present invention. After a short has been created<br>
4<br>
in a short arc welding system, the short is cleared by a subsequent increase in the welding current. Such<br>
procedure is well known in short arc welding systems and is described generally in Ihde 6,617,549 and in<br>
75 Parks 4,866,247. Consequently, the technology described in Ihde 6,617,549 is also incorporated herein as<br>
background technology. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is a modification of a<br>
standard AC pulse welding system known in the welding industry. A prior pending application of<br>
assignee describes standard pulse welding, both DC and AC, with an energy measurement circuit or<br>
program for a high frequency switching power source of the type used in practicing an exemplary AC<br>
80 short circuit implementation of the present invention. Although not necessary for understanding the<br>
present invention or practicing the present invention, this prior application, which is Serial No.<br>
11/103,040 filed April 11, 2005, is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The present invention relates to a cored electrode and a short arc welding system, and method, for<br>
controlling the melting pulse of the system for depositing a special cored electrode so no shielding gas is<br>
85 needed, which is capable of satisfying the requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute (API)<br>
Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher. The system and method maintains a desired time between the pulse and<br>
the actual short circuit. This time is controlled by a feedback loop involving a desired timing of the short<br>
circuit and the pulse, so that the size of the ball of the pulse is varied to maintain a consistent short circuit<br>
timing. This process is a substantial improvement of other short arc control arrangements, such as<br>
90 disclosed in Pijls 4,020,320 using two power sources. A first source maintains a constant size melting<br>
pulse and there is a fixed time between the short circuit and the subsequent clearing pulse. There is no<br>
feedback between the pulsed timing and a parameter of the melting pulse, as employed in the present<br>
invention. A desired time is maintained between the end of the melting pulse and the short circuit event.<br>
By fixing the desired time using a feedback loop concept, arc stability is improved. This invention is<br>
95 applicable to a DC process, as shown in Pijls 4,020,320, but is primarily advantageous when using an AC<br>
short arc welding system. Consequently, Pijls 4,020,320 is incorporated by reference herein as<br>
5<br>
I<br>
background technology showing a control circuit for a DC short arc system wherein two unrelated<br>
timings are maintained constant without a closed loop control of the melting pulse.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a system and method for addressing the problems discussed<br>
above and providing a system and method which is capable of creating a weld which satisfies the<br>
110 requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher.<br>
Specifically, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention can achieve over 550 MPa yield strength<br>
^ and 690 MPa tensile strength, and a Charpy V-Notch (CVN) toughness of over 60 Joules at -20 degrees<br>
C.<br>
The system and method of the present invention controls the welding arc through a specialized<br>
115 power source to minimize the arc length coupled with the use of a cored, i.e. self-shielded, electrode to<br>
achieve the desired welding attributes. The use of the short arc minimizes the contamination fi-om the<br>
atmosphere in the weld pool, thus improving toughness, while at the same time being more resistant to<br>
porosity during welding. Further, the use of the short arc length allows for the use of a self-shielding<br>
electrode, according to an embodiment of the present invention, which contains a composition according<br>
120 to an aspect of the present invention, discussed fiirther below. Additionally, with the present invention,<br>
6<br>
there is no need to use additional shielding gas to achieve a weld which satisfies the requirements for<br>
welding American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher, and/or over 550 MPa yield<br>
strength and 690 MPa tensile strength, and a Charpy V-Notch (CVN) toughness of over 60 Joules at -20<br>
degrees C.<br>
125 In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention as it relates to the method, the melting<br>
pulse of the short arc waveform is controlled interactively by a feedback loop and not by fixing constant<br>
values of the melting pulse. The time between the end of the melting pulse and the short circuit is<br>
^ maintained by reactively changing parameters of the melting pulse in a short arc welding system. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention the system is an AC system, but can be used in a DC system of<br>
130 the type generally described in Pijls 4,020,320. Manipulation of the short arc waveform is facilitated by<br>
using a single power source having the waveform controlled by a waveform generator operating the pulse<br>
width modulator of a high switching speed inverter, such as disclosed in Houston 6,472,634. One<br>
advantage realized by implementation of the present invention is an improvement over short arc welding<br>
using two separate power sources, as shown in the prior art.<br>
135 In accordance with another embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the short arc<br>
welding system is an AC system wherein the melting pulse has a negative polarity. To maintain a<br>
^ ^ constant molten metal bead, there is a joule threshold switch to shift the power supply to a low level<br>
positive current so the molten metal on the end of the advancing electrode forms into a ball and then short<br>
circuits against the workpiece weld puddle. In an embodiment, this AC waveform is controlled by a<br>
140 waveform generator controlling the profile of the individual current segments of the waveform and<br>
determining the polarity of the waveform segments. In the prior art, a joule threshold switch was used to<br>
provide a constant energy to the melting pulse. In accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, there is a timer to measure the time for the electrode to short after the melting pulse. A<br>
feedback loop is employed to maintain a consistent time between the mehing pulse and the short circuit<br>
145 event. This control of time stabilizes the arc and the shorting cycle. In one embodiment of the present<br>
7<br>
invention, the time between the melting pulse and the short is about 1.0 ms. Depending upon the<br>
electrode size and deposition rate, the time between the melting pulse and the short circuit event may be<br>
adjusted to a fixed value in the general range of 0.5 ms to 2.0 ms. Control of the timing is typically<br>
applicable to AC short arc welding; however, the same concept is applicable to straight DC positive<br>
150 polarity. In both instances, the advancing wire with molten metal formed by the melting pulse is held at a<br>
low quiescent positive current facilitating the formation of a ball preparatory to the short circuit event. In<br>
either implementation of the invention, the joules or other parameter of the melting pulse is controlled by<br>
a feedback loop conditioned to maintain a preset time to the short circuit event.<br>
The AC implementation of the first aspect of the present invention is usefiil for tubular electrodes<br>
155 of the flux cored type and one embodiment is implimented with a flux core electrode with alloy<br>
ingredients in the core according to an aspect of the present invention, discussed further below. Control<br>
of the melting cycle of a flux cored electrode based upon feedback from the short circuit time is a very<br>
precise procedure to maintain stability of the AC short circuit welding process. In view of the foregoing,<br>
an embodiment the present invention may be used to weld pipe with a cored, i.e. self-shielding, electrode<br>
160 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The welding current for such electrode, when using<br>
a method of the present invention, is below the threshold current for spray welding. Thus, the metal<br>
^ ^ transfer to the pipe joint must involve some type of short circuit, and in an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will involve a globular short circuit transfer of the type to which the present invention is<br>
directed. Improving the weld stability by using AC short arc welding still may result in instability of the<br>
165 arc. This instability has been overcome by implementing the present invention. Thus, the present<br>
invention is particularly applicable to AC short arc welding of a pipe joint using a self-shielding cored<br>
electrode, so that the weld strength satisfies the requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute<br>
(API) Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a welding system<br>
170 for performing a short arc welding process between an advancing wire electrode and a workpiece, where<br>
8<br>
I<br>
the system comprises a power source with a controller for creating a current pulse introducing energy into<br>
the electrode to melt the end of the electrode and a low current quiescent metal transfer section allowing<br>
the melted metal on the end of the electrode to be deposited into the weld puddle of the workpiece.<br>
During the low current metal transfer section, the molten metal short circuits against the molten metal<br>
175 puddle. A timer measures the actual time between the end of the melting pulse and the short circuit event.<br>
A device is used to set a desired time between the pulse and short circuit event and a circuit is used to<br>
create a corrective signal based upon the difference between the actual time and the desired time. This<br>
corrective signal is used to control a given parameter of the melting pulse, such as the total energy<br>
introduced into the wire during the melting pulse.<br>
180 In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the<br>
short arc welding process is an AC process wherein the melting pulse is performed with a negative<br>
current and the quiescent low current metal transfer section of the waveform is at a positive polarity. The<br>
AC version of the present invention is applicable for welding with a flux cored electrode in several<br>
environments, such as the root pass of a pipe welding joint.<br>
185 In accordance with another aspect of the power source of the present invention, the controller of<br>
the short arc welding system includes a circuit to create a short circuit clearing pulse after the short<br>
^k circuit. In this embodiment of the power source a waveform generator determines the polarity and profile<br>
of the welding waveform at any given time. The welding system of the present invention is used to<br>
maintain the time between the melting pulse and the short at a fixed value, which fixed value is in the<br>
190 general range 0.5-2.0 ms and, in another embodiment is approximately 1.0 ms.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the power source or method performed by the power source,<br>
the short arc system is performed DC positive with both the melting pulse and the quiescent section being<br>
positive and followed by a short circuit positive clearing pulse. This implementation of the present<br>
invention does not involve a polarity change from the waveform generator during the processing of the<br>
9 â€¢ I<br>
195 waveform to practice the short arc welding process. The short arc welding system is AC and there is a<br>
circuit to control the current pulse for causing the actual time between the melting pulse and short circuit<br>
so it is the same as the desired time. This embodiment of the present invention maintains a constant time,<br>
as does other embodiments of the present invention.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention controls the energy of the melting pulse to control the<br>
200 time between the melting pulse and the ultimate short circuit event.<br>
Yet another aspect of the first aspect of the invention is the provision of a method for controlling<br>
Wf the melting pulse of a short arc welding process so that the process has a selected time between the<br>
melting pulse and the short circuit event. The parameter controlled by this method is the total energy of<br>
the melting pulse. This embodiment of the present invention may be used in the root pass of a circular<br>
205 open root pipe joint using a flux cored electrode.<br>
A second aspect of the invention relates at least in part, to utilizing a relatively short arc length<br>
during AC welding as obtained by the described short arc method, which results in contamination of the<br>
weld fi-om the atmosphere being significantly reduced. This embodiment of the invention also utilizes a<br>
particular flux alloy system, which when used in an electrode along with this aspect of the invention, can<br>
210 achieve beneficial results. The flux/alloy system of the cored electrode enables and promotes a short arc<br>
^ length. Combining these aspects in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, provides a<br>
synergistic phenomenon which produces a sound and tough weld metal with strength of over 60 to 70 ksi,<br>
and in another embodiment have a yield strength of at least 80 ksi, thus providing a weld which satisfies<br>
the requirements for welding American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe, or higher.<br>
215 Further, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention can achieve over 550 MPa yield strength and<br>
690 MPa tensile strength, and a Charpy V-Notch (CVN) toughness of over 60 Joules at -20 degrees C.<br>
Moreover, alloys, as used in embodiments of the present invention, allow use of thiimer pipes and there is<br>
no need for shielding gas in the pipe welding area.<br>
10<br>
I<br>
Waveform technology, as pioneered by The Lincoln Electric Company of Cleveland, Ohio, has<br>
220 been modified for use in AC welding with flux cored electrodes. Cored electrodes allow the welding<br>
operation to be more precisely controlled with the alloy of the weld bead being tailored to the desired<br>
mechanical characteristics for the bead and with the position of the welding operation being less limited.<br>
However, to provide arc stability and appropriate melting temperatures and rates, the actual control of the<br>
waveform for the AC process is quite complicated. Contamination of the weld metal during arc welding<br>
225 is still a problem using AC welding for cored electrodes. Contaminants, in the weld metal after the<br>
welding operation can cause porosity, cracking and other types of defects in the weld metal.<br>
Consequently, a major challenge confronting designers of arc welding processes has been to develop<br>
techniques for excluding elements, such as contaminants from the atmosphere, from the arc environment<br>
or for neutralizing the potentially harmfiil effects of such impurities. The potential source of<br>
230 contamination, includes the materials that comprise the welding electrode, impurities in the workpiece<br>
itself and ambient atmosphere. Cored electrodes may contain "killing" agents, such as aluminum,<br>
magnesium, zirconium and titanium which agents combine chemically with potential contaminates to<br>
prevent them from forming porosity and harmfiil inclusion in the weld metal. The present invention<br>
involves the use of an elecfrode composition that reduces the tendency of a cored electrode to allow<br>
235 inclusion of contaminants in the weld metal. The method also reduces the amount of material required as<br>
W a "killing" agent.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a self-shielded flux cored arc welding (FCAW-S)<br>
electrode particularly adapted for forming welds having reduced levels of contaminants using an AC<br>

The present invention provides a method of arc welding using a self-shielded flux cored electrode<br>
245 that utilizes a particular alloy/flux system. The method comprises applying a first negative voltage<br>
between an electrode and a substrate to cause at least partial melting of the electrode proximate the<br>
substrate. The method also comprises applying a positive voltage between the electrode and the substrate<br>
to promote formation of a flowable mass of material from the electrode. The method flirther comprises<br>
monitoring for occurrence of an electrical short between the electrode and the substrate through the<br>
250 flowable mass. The method further comprises upon detecting an electrical short, applying a second<br>
negative voltage between the electrode and the substrate. And, the method comprises increasing the<br>
magnitude of the second negative voltage, to thereby clear the electrical short and form a weld on the<br>

denitriding agent selected from the group consisting of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and<br>
combinations thereof<br>
An object of the present invention is the provision of a short arc welding system, which system j<br>
controls the spacing of the short circuit events during the process, especially when the process is<br>
^^260 performed in the AC mode, to provide a weld which satisfies the requirements for welding at least<br>
American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the provision of a method for short arc welding, which<br>
method controls the melting pulse based upon the time between the melting pulse and short so this time<br>
remains fixed at a desired value.<br>
265 Yet another object of the present invention is the provision of an improved electrode composition,<br>
and particularly an electrode fill composition which is particularly adapted for use in combination with<br>
the novel short arc welding system and method.<br>

A further object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic system comprising a short arc<br>
process and flux cored electrode to stabilize the arc at the shortest possible arc length. Thus, the<br>

process allows the arc to be stable at such short arc lengths and result in a sound and tough weld metal.<br>
One embodiment of the invention can provide a weld, without the use of gas-shielding, having a yield<br>
strength of at least 80 ksi, thus providing a weld which satisfies the requirements for welding American<br>

EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the electric arc welding industry, short arc welding is a common practice and involves the four<br>
stages I, II, III and IV as schematically disclosed in FIGURE 2. The power source for performing short<br>
320 arc welding can be a transformer based power source; however, in accordance with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, system A, shown in FIGURE 1, utilizes a high switching speed<br>
inverter based power source B having an AC supply across lines 10, 14, or a three phase supply, directed<br>
to inverter 14 creating a first DC signal across lines 14a, 14b. In accordance with standard architecture,<br>
boost or buck converter 20 is used in power source B for correcting the input power factor by creating a<br>
325 controlled second DC signal across output lines 22, 24. High switching speed inverter 30 converts the<br>
second DC signal across lines 22, 24 to a waveform created by a large number of current pulses across<br>
output leads 32, 34. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
waveform across leads 32, 34 is either DC positive or AC; therefore, inverter 30 has an output stage, not<br>
^ shown, that dictates the polarity of the profiled waveform across leads 32, 34. These lead^ are connected<br>
330 to electrode E and workpiece WP, respectively. In accordance with standard short arc technology,<br>
electrode E is an advancing end of wire W supplied through contact tip 42 Irom supply spool or drum 40.<br>
Thus, wire W is driven toward workpiece WP at a given WFS as a controlled waveform having the<br>
desired polarity is created across the gap between electrode E and workpiece WP. In an embodiment of<br>
the invention, the wire W is a flux cored wire schematically illustrated in FIGURE lA and shown to<br>
335 include an outer low carbon steel sheath 50 surrounding an internal flux core 52 having a fluxing agent<br>
15<br>
and normally including alloying particles, also known as a self-shielded wire or electrode. An<br>
embodiment of the electrode will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
Shunt 60 drives feedback current device 62 so the voltage signal on line 64 is representative of<br>
the instantaneous arc current of the welding process. In a like manner, device 70 creates a signal on<br>
340 output line 72 representative of the instantaneous voltage of the welding process. Controller C of inverter<br>
30 is a digital device, such as a DSP or microprocessor, that performs ftinctions schematically illustrated<br>
in generally analog architecture. As a central component of controller C a waveform generator 100<br>
^ ^ processes a specific waveform from a state table stored in memory unit 102 and selected according to the<br>
desired welding process by device or circuit 104. Upon selecting the desired short arc welding process a<br>
345 select signal 104a is directed to memory unit 102 so that the state table defining the attributes and<br>
parameters of the desired short arc welding waveform is loaded into waveform generator 100 as indicated<br>
by line 102a. Generator 100 outputs the profile of the waveform at any given time on output line 100a<br>
with the desired polarity indicated by the logic on line 100b. Illustrated power source B controlled by<br>
digital controller C is of the current control feedback type wherein the current representative voltage on<br>
350 line 64 is combined with the waveform profile signal on line 100a by error amplifier 110 having an output<br>
signal on line 110a to control pulse width modulator 112 in accordance with standard waveform control<br>
technology. The output signal on line 112a controls the shape of the waveform across lines 32, 34 and the<br>
polarity of the particular waveform profile being implemented is set by the logic on line 100b. In this<br>
manner, waveform generator 100 controls pulse width modulator 112 to have pulses in line 112a<br>
355 controlling the high fi-equency operation of inverter 30. This inverter switching frequency is generally<br>
greater than 18 kHz and preferably greater than about 40 kHz. As so far described, power source B with<br>
controller C operates in accordance with standard technology pioneered by The Lincoln Electric<br>
Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Controller C is digital, but illustrated in analog format. To implement a<br>
short arc welding process, it is necessary for controller C to receive feedback information regarding a<br>
360 short circuit condition between electrode E and workpiece WP. This feature of controller C is<br>
16<br>
schematically illustrated as a short circuit detector 120 that creates a logic on line 122 to announce the<br>
existence of a short circuit event SC to waveform generator 100. Thus, the generator is informed when<br>
there is a short circuit and implements a waveform in accordance with processing a short circuit as<br>
accomplished in any short arc welding process. As so far described, controller C is standard technology,<br>
365 with the exception of controlling a polarity switch at the output of inverter 30 by the logic on line 100b.<br>
To practice the invention, controller C is provided with a circuit 150 for controlling the melting<br>
pulse preparatory to the short circuit. Circuit 150 is digital, but schematically illustrated in analog<br>
^ architecture. The functions are implemented by the digital processor of controller C to control the energy<br>
of the melting pulse. Such energy control circuitry is described in prior copending application Serial No.<br>
370 11/103,040 filed by applicant on April 11, 2005. This prior application is incorporated by reference<br>
herein not as prior art, but as related technology. As shown in the prior application, the energy of the<br>
melting pulse of a pulsed welding waveform can be controlled by circuit 150 including multiplier 152 for<br>
multiplying the instantaneous signal on lines 64, 72 to provide a signal on line 154 representing the<br>
instantaneous watts of the welding process. The wattage signal or line 154 is accumulated by a standard I<br>
375 integrator 156 as described in Parks 4,866,247. Integration of the watt signal on line 154 is controlled by |<br>
waveform generator 100 that creates a pulse start command shown as block 160 to correspond to the start<br>
of the melting pulse indicated by logic on line 162. The starting point is the time ti when the melting<br>
pulse is started by waveform generator 100. Output signal on line 164 starts integration of the watt signal<br>
on line 154 by integrator 156. The integration process is stopped by a logic on line 170 produced by<br>
380 activation of stop pulse device or circuit 172 upon receipt of logic on input line 172a. Logic on line 172a<br>
toggles device 172 to change the logic in output lines 172a and 172c. The logic on line 172c Informs the<br>
waveform generator that the melting pulse is to stop to change the profile on output line 100a. At the<br>
same time, the signal on line 172b toggles reset device or circuit 174 to change the logic on line 170 to<br>
stop integration of the instantaneous watt signal. The digital number on output line 156a is loaded into<br>
385 digital register 180 having an output 182 representing the total energy of a given melting pulse in the<br>
17<br>
i<br>
short art welding process. This total energy signal is compared with a desired energy level stored in<br>
register 190 to provide a digital number or signal on line 192. Comparator 194 compares the actual<br>
energy for a given pulse represented by a number on line 182 with a desired energy level indicated by the<br>
number on line 192. The relationship between the actual energy and the desired energy controls the logic<br>
390 on line 172a. When the signal from line 182 equals the signal on line 192, comparator 194 changes the<br>
logic on line 172a to stop the pulse as indicated by device or circuit 172. This stops integration and stops<br>
the melting pulse being created by waveform generator 100. Circuit 150 is employed for performing an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention which changes the reference or desired energy for the<br>
melting pulse by changing the number on line 192 through adjustment of circuit 200. The pulse is<br>
395 stopped when the adjusted energy or energy threshold is reached as determined by the number signal on<br>
line 182 as compared to the signal on line 192. In an embodiment of the present invention, the power<br>
source and method used adjusts circuit 200 to change the reference energy for performing a short arc<br>
welding process by changing the melting pulse.<br>
Short arc welding system A using power source B with digital controller C is operated by<br>
400 adjusting circuit 200 to perform the waveform shown in FIGURE 3. AC current waveform 200 has a<br>
negative melting pulse 212 represented by stage I in FIGURE 2 where the melting pulse produces molten<br>
metal 220 on the end of electrode E. The level of current in pulse 212 is below current needed for spray<br>
arc so there is a transfer by a short. The time ti starts the Joule measurement, as explained later. The<br>
pulse has a start position 212a at time ti and a stop position 212b at time t2. Following the melting pulse,<br>
405 in accordance with standard practice, there is a positive low current quiescent transfer section 214, as<br>
represented by stage II of FIGURE 2. In this stage, the molten metal 220 on the end of advancing<br>
electrode E is formed into a ball by surface tension action awaiting a short circuit which occurs at time t3<br>
and is shown as stage III. Consequently, the time between t2 and h is the time between the end of the<br>
melting pulse and the short circuit event, which time is indicated by the logic on line 122 as shown in<br>
410 FIGURE 1. After stage II, a current pinch action shown as neck 222 separates the molten metal 220 from<br>
I<br>
J<br>
puddle 224. This electrical pinching action shown in stage IV is accelerated in accordance with standard<br>
practice by a negative short circuit pulse 216 having a first current section 216a with a steep slope and<br>
followed by a second current section 216b with a more gradual slope. Ultimately, the shorted metal<br>
separates and the SC logic on line 122 shifts to start the next current pulse at time ti indicated by a<br>
415 transition section 218. Waveform 210 is an AC waveform having a negative melting pulse 212, a low<br>
current quiescent section 214 and a clearance pulse 216 transitioning into the next negative pulse 212 at<br>
time ti. The corresponding voltage has a waveform 230 with negative section 232, a low level positive<br>
section 234 that plunges at short 236 and is followed by a negative voltage section 238 that transitions at<br>
section 240 into the next melting pulse voltage 232. The total cycle time is from ti to the next ti and the<br>
420 positive transfer 214 has a time less than 20% of the total cycle time. This prevents stubbing.<br>
The present invention involves a power source and method for controlling waveform 210 by<br>
waveform generator 100 of controller C so the time between the end of melting pulse 212 at t2 and the<br>
time of the actual short event t3 is constant based upon adjustment of circuit 200. This time delay<br>
adjustment, in an exemplary embodirnent, is accomplished by the circuit 250 shown in FIGURE 4. In this<br>
425 circuit, the time between the melting pulse and at time t2 and the short circuit at time ta is set to a desired<br>
level between 0.5 to 2.0 ms. In one embodiment, the set desired time delay is 1.0 ms, which is the level<br>
of the signal on line 254. Thus, the numerical number on line 254 is the desired time t2 to h. The actual<br>
time between t2 and h is determined by timer 260 which is started at time t2 and stopped at time h. The<br>
timer is reset for the next measurement by an appropriate time indicated as ts which can be adjusted to be<br>
430 located at various positions after ts. which position is illustrated to be during the melting pulse in FIGURE<br>
3. The number on line 262 is the actual time between t2 and tj. This actual time is stored in register 270<br>
which is reset at any appropriate time such as time t2. Thus, the digital data on line 272 is the actual<br>
measured time between t2 and .ts. This time is compared to the desired time on line 254. Any error<br>
amplifier can be used to digitally process the relationship of actual time to the set time. The process is<br>
435 schematically illustrated as a summing junction 280 and digital filter 282 having an output 284 for<br>
19<br>
adjusting circuit 200. The difference between the desired time and the actual time is an error signal in<br>
line 284 which increases or decreases the desired total energy of circuit 200. The desired total energy is<br>
periodically updated at an appropriate time indicated as t2 by an update circuit 290. Thus, at all times the<br>
signal in line 192 of FIGURE 1 is the desired total energy for pulse 212 of the short arc process. This<br>
440 total energy is adjusted by any difference between time t2 and time ts so the energy of pulse 212 maintains<br>
a constant or desired time delay for the upcoming short circuit. This time control stabilizes the short arc<br>
welding process of system A.<br>
^ In FIGURE 4, an exemplary embodiment of the power source is implemented by changing the<br>
energy threshold for the melting pulse to change the timing between the pulse and the short event. This<br>
445 time can also be changed by voltage or power of the melting pulse as schematically illustrated in<br>
FIGURES 5 and 6. In both of these embodiments, the time of the melting pulse ti to ti is maintained<br>
fixed as indicated by block 300. During this constant time melting pulse, the voltage or power is changed<br>
to control the time between the pulse and the short circuit event. In FIGURE 5, the number on output line<br>
284 fi-om filter 282 controls feedback loop 310 to adjust the voltage of the melting pulse, as indicated by<br>
450 the numerical data on line 312. To adjust the power for controlling the delay time of the short circuit i<br>
event, the number on output line 284 is used to adjust feedback loop 320, which is compared to the<br>
^ instantaneous power on line 154 by waveform generator 100. The change in power is a numerical value<br>
on line 322 which is compared to the digital number on line 154 for controlling the power of the melting<br>
pulse. Thus, in embodiments of the present invention, the total energy of the waveform, the voltage of the<br>
455 waveform or the power of the waveform is adjusted to maintain a constant time between tj to ts to<br>
stabilize the arc and control the short circuit events of system A shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the power source, the energy adjustment of melting<br>
pulse 212 is combined with the two modifications of the present invention illustrated in FIGURES 5 and<br>
6. Such combination controls are shown in FIGURES 7 and 8 wherein prior summing junction 280 and<br>
460 digital filter 282 are illustrated as combined in analog error amplifier 330. The component or program<br>
20<br>
has output 332 with a logic for stopping the melting pulse when the threshold energy has been reached, as<br>
indicated by the logic on line 182. Thus, the total energy of the pulse is controlled together with the pulse<br>
voltage control circuit 310 in FIGURE 7 and the pulse power control 320 as shown in FIGURE 8. Output<br>
312 is combined with output 172c for controlling the waveform profile in line 100a of generator 100. In a<br>
465 like manner, the energy level is controlled by logic on line 172c in combination with the digital<br>
information on output line 322 of power pulse control circuit 320. Other combinations of parameters can<br>
be used to control melting pulse 212 to assure an accurate control of the time between the melting pulse<br>
and the short circuit event.' Such other parameters are within the skill of the art in controlling a waveform<br>
generator by closed feedback loops.<br>
470 In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the process is an AC process, as shown in<br>
FIGURE 4; however, DC positive waveform 400 can be used as shown in FIGURE 9. Melting purse 402<br>
has a high positive current 402a until the pulse is terminated at time t2. The current, in the DC positive<br>
mode, is limited to a level below that needed for spray arc so the metal is not detached without shorting.<br>
This concept defines the short arc welding process. Then the waveform transitions into a low level j<br>
475 positive current section 404 awaiting the short at time ts. This low level positive current is used in an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention and terminates at time ts. Thereafter, short clearing pulse<br>
^ 410 is created by the waveform generator. Pulse 410 has high ramp area 412 and a stepped area 414 to<br>
bring the current back up to the high current level 402a. Various illustrated embodiments of the present<br>
invention can be used in implementing the positive current waveform 400; however, the logic on line<br>
480 100b for controlling the polarity of the output waveform on lines 32, 34 is not necessary.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the power source is in pipe welding operation using a flux cored<br>
electrode as schematically represented in FIGURE lA. Such pipe welding operation is schematically<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 10 wherein pipe sections 420, 422 define an open root 424. The present invention<br>
as shown in FIGURE 4 controls the waveform on wire W as it moves through contact tip 42 to open root<br>
485 424 of the pipe joint. FIGURE 10 shows a particular embodiment using the present invention for welding<br>
21<br>
i<br>
the root pass of a pipe joint to tack the pipe sections together for subsequent joining with standard<br>
welding techniques.<br>
In certain embodiments, the power sources and/or welding operations according to the present<br>
invention exhibit one or more of the following aspects. The current density is generally less than that<br>
490 required for spray welding since the primary mode of metal transfer is short circuit welding. As in many<br>
short circuit processes, a pinch current is established depending upon the wire diameter, for example for a<br>
5/64 inch flux cored wire, a current of 625 amps can be used. Generally, the positive current tends to set<br>
^ ^ the arc length. If the positive current is allowed to reach the same level as the negative current arc length,<br>
even for half a millisecond, the positive current arc will reach a non-desirable length. Generally, positive<br>
495 side control current is in the range of from about 50 amps to about 125 amps, and in one embodiment is<br>
about 75 amps. The negative portion of the wave shape can either be a constant power or voltage with a<br>
slope of from about 5 to 15 percent current. Typically, welding can be performed at about 60 hertz, 10<br>
percent positive. Since the positive current is set at a relatively low level, the portion that the wave shape<br>
is positive is typically less than 20 percent.<br>
500 FIGURES 11 and 12 schematically illustrate a waveform technology welder and/or welding<br>
system 510, and a cored electrode 530. The welding system comprises a welder 510 having a torch 520<br>
^ for directing an electrode 530 toward workpiece W. The welding system 510 includes a three phase input<br>
power supply LI, L2, and L3, which is rectified through rectifier 550, 560, and a power source 540. The<br>
power source 540 provides an output, and specifically, an AC waveform as described in U.S. application<br>
505 Serial No. 11/263,064, filed October 31, 2005, previously incorporated by reference. An arc AC is<br>
created between the end of electrode 530 and workpiece W. The electrode is a cored electrode with a<br>
sheath 600 and an internal filled core 610. The core includes flux ingredients, such as represented by<br>
particles 610a. The purpose of these ingredients 610a is to (a) shield the molten weld metal from<br>
atmospheric contamination by covering the molten metal with stag, (b) combine chemically with any<br>
510 atmospheric contaminants such that their negative impact on the weld quality is minimized and/or (c)<br>
22<br>
generate arc shielding gases. In accordance with standard practice, core 610 also includes alloying<br>
ingredients, referred to as particles 610b, together with other miscellaneous particles 610c that are<br>
combined to provide the fill of core 610. In prior applications, to optimize the welding operation, it has<br>
been necessary to use solid wire with an external shielding gas. However, in order to produce a weld with<br>
515 specific mechanical and metallurgical properties, specific alloys are required, which can be difficult to<br>
obtain in the form of a solid wire. Further, gas shielding is not always a feasible alternative due to access<br>
to gas or difficulty to achieve adequate shielding due to windy conditions, accessibility to clean gas<br>
mixtures and difficult terrains. It is, therefore, advantageous to use a self shielding cored electrode, so<br>
that the environment does not affect the welding, as in the present invention.<br>
520 A common problem caused when using cored electrodes without control of the welding<br>
waveform profile is illustrated in FIGURE 13. The welding process melts sheath 600 to provide a portion<br>
of molten metal 630 melted upwardly around the electrode, as indicated by melted upper end 640. Thus,<br>
the sheath of the electrode is melted more rapidly than the core. This causes a molten metal material to<br>
exist at the output end of electrode 530 without protective gas or chemical reaction created by melting of<br>
525 the internal constituents of core 610. Thus, arc AC melts the metal of electrode 610 in an unprotected<br>
atmosphere. The necessary shielding for the molten metal is formed when the sheath and core are melted<br>
at the same rate. The problem of melting the molten metal more rapidly than the core is fiirther indicated<br>
by the pictorial representation of FIGURE 14. Molten metal 650 Irom sheath 600 has already joined<br>
workpiece W before the core 610 has had an opportunity to be melted. Thus, the core 610 can not<br>
530 provide the necessary shielding for the welding process. FIGURES 13 and 14 show the reason why AC<br>
welding using cored electrodes has not been used for off-shore pipeline welding and other pipeline<br>
welding. However, an AC waveform can be utilized to control the heat input when using a cored<br>
electrode.<br>
By controlling the precise profile for the AC waveform used in the welding process, sheath 600<br>
535 and core 610 can be made to melt at approximately the same rate. The failure to adequately coordinate<br>
23<br>
the melting of the sheath with the melting of the core is one reason why a shielding gas SG, as shown in<br>
FIGURE 15 may be used. The advantage of controlling the profile of the AC waveform is that external<br>
shielding gas SG, may be avoided.<br>
Although control of the AC waveform can lead to significant advantages, as previously noted, in<br>
540 order to provide arc stability and appropriate melting temperatures and rates, the actual control of the AC<br>
waveform, is quite complicated. And, even with the use of sophisticated AC waveforms, contamination<br>
of the weld is possible. Contamination of welds formed by using sophisticated AC waveforms, is still<br>
^ possible, even if shielding gas is used. Accordingly, in a preferred aspect of the present invention, certain |<br>
electrode compositions are provided that, when used in conjunction with AC waveforms, can form strong,<br>
545 tough, and durable welds, without significant contamination problems, and without the degree of control<br>
otherwise required for the AC waveforms.<br>
When welding by the method or power source, of the present invention, with a cored electrode, it<br>
is desired to have the sheath and core melt at the same rate. This operation promotes homogeneous<br>
mixing of certain core materials with the outer sheath, such that the mixture of molten materials<br>
550 chemically resists the effects of atmospheric contamination. Alloying elements required to produce<br>
desired weld metal mechanical and metallurgical characteristics are uniformly distributed in the weld<br>
t^ metal. In addition, the protective benefits derived from slag and/or gas-forming constituents are<br>
optimized. As previously noted, this situation is illustrated in FIGURE 15. In contrast, FIGURE 14<br>
illustrates a situation where the sheath has melted more rapidly than the core. In this deleterious situation,<br>
555 molten metal 650 from sheath 500 has already joined workpiece W before core 610 has had an<br>
opportunity to be melted. Metal 650 has not been protected from the effects of atmospheric<br>
contamination to the degree that it would have been if the unmelted core constituents had actually been<br>
melted. Additionally, alloying elements needed to achieve desired mechanical and metallurgical<br>
characteristics may be missing from molten metal 650.<br>
24<br>
560 As previously indicated, an electric welder of the type using waveform technology can be used<br>
for AC welding using a cored electrode, such as electrode shown in FIGURE 16. Such electrode includes<br>
an outer steel sheath 710 surrounding core 720 formed of particulate material, including alloying metals<br>
and slag or flux materials. By having internal flux or slag materials, there is no need for external<br>
shielding gas during the welding operation. By including alloying material in core 720, the puddle of<br>
565 weld metal 740 on workpiece 730 can be modified to have exact alloy constituents. This is an advantage<br>
and reason for using cored electrodes, instead of solid welding wire where alloying must be accomplished<br>
by the actual constituent of the welding wire. Adjustment of alloying for the weld metal is quite difficult<br>
when using solid welding wire. Therefore, it is advantageous in high quality welding to employ a cored,<br>
i.e. self-shielded electrode. Arc AR melts sheath 710 and melts constituents or fill in core 720 at a rate<br>
570 which can be controlled to be essentially the same. Contamination in weld metal 740, such as hydrogen,<br>
nitrogen and oxygen can cause porosity problems, cracking and other types of physical defects in the<br>
weld metal. Thus, it is a challenge to design the welding process to exclude contaminates from the<br>
molten weld metal. It is common to use "killing" agents, typically silicon, aluminum, titanium and/or<br>
zirconium which will combine chemically with potential contaminates to prevent them from forming<br>
575 porosity or harmfiil inclusions in the weld metal. Furthermore, "scavengers" may also be added to react<br>
with hydrogen containing a species in order to remove hydrogen from the weld. In order to deposit<br>
^ ^ consistently sound weld metal 740, it has often been necessary to add such killing agents in quantities that<br>
are themselves detrimental to properties of the weld metal, such as ductility and low temperature<br>
toughness. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the exposure of the molten metal in arc AR to prevent<br>
580 contamination of the metal passing from electrode 700 to workpiece 730 so the killing agents can be<br>
minimized.<br>
The electrode compositions, of the present invention, when used in AC welding, produce<br>
desirable welds that are durable, tough, and which are not susceptible to problems otherwise associated<br>
with the use of conventional electrode compositions. The electrode compositions of the present invention<br>
25<br>
585 may be used in conjunction with AC waveforms where the positive and negative shapes of the AC<br>
waveform are modified to reduce the overall arc length LA. In this maimer, there is less exposure to the<br>
atmosphere and less time during which the metal is molten. A detailed description of the AC waveforms<br>
and related welding processes, for which the present invention electrode compositions are designed, is set<br>
forth in U.S. application Serial No., 11/263,064, filed October 31, 2005, previously incorporated by<br>
590 reference. Indeed, by reducing the arc length, the temperature of the molten metal can be reduced as it<br>
travels from the electrode 700 to weld metal puddle 740. Typically, when using a welder that can<br>
perform an AC welding process with different shapes for the negative and positive sections, AC welding<br>
with cored electrodes can be used effectively in the field. Parameters of the positive and negative<br>
portions of the alternating waveform can be independently adjusted to compensate for and optimize the<br>
595 melting of both sheath 710 and cored 720 for selected electrode 700.<br>
More specifically, an embodiment of the present invention involves the combination of an<br>
electrode and an AC welding wherein the positive and negative sections of the waveform are individually<br>
adjusted to accomplish the objective of a low arc length and reduce contamination. Using this strategy,<br>
the electrode composition of the present invention, particularly because it is self-shielding, can provide<br>
600 significant advantages. The electrodes are used without shielding gas and depending upon the particular<br>
^ application, can rely on deoxidizing and denitriding agents in the core for additional protection from<br>
atmospheric contamination.<br>
Thus, an embodiment of the present invention provides a synergistic system of a welding method<br>
with a unique set of alloying and flux components in the core of a FCAW-S electrode. As noted, a cored<br>
605 electrode is a continuously fed tubular metal sheath with a core of powdered flux and/or alloying<br>
ingredients. These may include fluxing elements, deoxidizing and denitriding agents, and alloying<br>
materials, as well as elements that increase toughness and strength, improve corrosion resistance, and<br>
stabilize the arc. Typical core materials may include aluminum, calcium, carbon, chromium, iron,<br>
manganese, and other elements and materials. While flux cored electrodes are more widely used, metal-<br>
26<br>
610 cored products are useflil for adjusting the filler metal composition when welding alloy steels. The<br>
powders in metal-cored electrodes generally are metal and alloy powders, rather than compounds,<br>
producing only small islands of slag on the face of the weld. By contrast, flux cored electrodes produce<br>
an extensive slag cover during welding, which supports and shapes the bead.<br>
The alloy/flux system, of the present invention, comprises particular amounts of a barium source,<br>
615 particular amounts of a lithium source, lithium oxide, iron oxide, and optional amounts of calcium oxide,<br>
silicon oxide, and manganese oxide. One or more fluoride, oxide and/or carbonate salts of barium can be<br>
g^ used for the barium source. And, one or more fluoride and/or carbonate salts of lithium can be used for<br>
the lithium source. The alloy/flux system is included in the electrode fill. The electrode fill generally<br>
constitutes fi-om about 18 to about 24% of the electrode. An exemplary embodiment of the alloy/flux<br>
620 system comprises:<br>
fi"om about 35 to about 55% barium fluoride as the barium source,<br>

otherwise. In an embodiment, the electrode fill composition comprises from about 35 to about 55%<br>
635 barium fluoride, from about 2 to about 12% lithium fluoride, from about 0 to about 15% lithium oxide,<br>
from about 0 to about 15% barium oxide, from about 5 to about 20% iron oxide, and up to about 25% of a<br>
deoxidizing and denitriding agent as previously noted. In other embodiments, the previously noted<br>
electrode fill composition can also include from about 0 to about 8% barium carbonate. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the elecfrode fill composition may additionally include from about 0 to about 8% lithium<br>
640 carbonate. In yet another embodiment, the fill composition can include from about 0 to about 5% calcium<br>
oxide. In yet a fiirther embodiment, the electrode fill composition can include from about 0 to about 5%<br>
silicon oxide. And, in another embodiment, the electrode fill composition can comprise from about 0 to<br>
about 5% manganese oxide. Other embodiments include the use of one or more of these agents, i.e. the<br>
barium carbonate, lithium carbonate, calcium oxide, silicon oxide, manganese oxide, and combinations<br>
645 thereof<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the method, of the present invention, comprises applying a first<br>
negative voltage between an electrode and a substrate to cause at least partial melting of the electrode<br>
near the subsfrate. The method also comprises applying a positive voltage between the elecfrode and the<br>
substrate to promote formation of a flowable mass of material from the electrode. The method fiirther<br>
650 comprises monitoring for occurrence of an electrical short between the electrode and the substrate through<br>
the flowable mass. The method further comprises upon detecting an electrical short, applying a second<br>
negative voltage between the elecfrode and the substrate. And, the method comprises increasing the<br>
magnitude of the second negative voltage, to thereby clear the electrical short and form a weld on the<br>
substrate from the flowable mass. The composition of the electrode fill in a flux cored electrode<br>
655 comprises from about 35 to about 55% barium fluoride, from about 2 to about 12% lithium fluoride, from<br>
28<br>
about 0 to about 15% lithium oxide, from about 0 to about 15% barium oxide, from about 5 to about 20%<br>
iron oxide, and up to about 25% of a deoxidation and denitriding agent selected from the group consisting<br>
of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and combinations thereof In other embodiments,<br>
additional agents can be incorporated in the electrode fill. For instance, from about 0 to about 8% barium<br>
660 carbonate can be included. Another embodiment of the electrode fill composition includes from about 0<br>
to about 8% lithium carbonate. Yet another embodiment includes from about 0 to .about 5% calcium<br>
oxide. Another embodiment includes from about 0 to about 5% silicon oxide. And, yet another<br>
embodiment includes from about 0 to about 5% manganese oxide. In yet a fiirther embodiment, one or<br>
^ more of these agents can be added or otherwise included in the electrode fill composition. For example,<br>
665 the elecfrode fill can also comprise, in addition to the previously noted proportions of barium fluoride,<br>
lithium fluoride, lithium oxide, barium oxide, iron oxide, and one or more particular deoxidation and<br>
denitriding agents from about 0 to about 8% barium carbonate, from about 0 to about 8% lithium<br>
carbonate, from about 0 to about 5% calcium oxide, from about 0 to about 5% silicon oxide, and from<br>
about 0 to about 5% manganese oxide.<br>
670 The flux/alloy system is modified from traditional flux/alloy systems used for FCAW-S<br>
elecfrodes to achieve the short arc length and to weld at low heat inputs that result from the unique<br>
waveforms used in this process. The short arc length and the stable arc is a result of the combination of<br>
the alloy and flux system and the unique characteristics of the waveform. In essence, both the welding<br>
consumable and the process are optimized in tandem to achieve the final weld product requirements.<br>
675 In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods of forming weld metals having<br>
attractive properties. Generally, these methods involve providing a welding wire or electrode having a<br>
core with the previously described composition. In an embodiment, the welding wire or electrode is used<br>
free of shielding gas, or rather agents that form such a gas. The methods also include an operation in<br>
which the wire or electrode is moved toward the region of interest, such as a joint formed between two<br>
680 sections of pipe. In an additional embodiment, such movement is made at a controlled feed speed. The<br>
29<br>
i<br>
i method also includes creating a welding current to melt the wire or electrode by an arc between the wire<br>
and the pipe sections to thereby form a molten metal bead in the joint. The method also includes<br>
transferring the melted wire to the molten metal bead by a succession of short circuit events. The method<br>
is particularly well suited for application to welding of a joint between two sections of pipe formed from a<br>
! 685 metal having a yield strength of at least about 70 ksi and a thickness less than about 0.75 inches. In a<br>
further embodiment, the invention can provide a weld, without the use of gas-shielding, having a yield<br>
strength of at least 80 ksi, thus providing a weld which satisfies the requirements for welding at least<br>
American Petroleum Institute (API) Grade X-80 line pipe. Further, an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
^ present invention can achieve over 550 MPa yield strength and 690 MPa tensile strength, and a Charpy V-<br>
690 Notch (CVN) toughness of over 60 Joules at -20 degrees C.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that the present invention can be used in applications on pipes<br>
having thicknesses greater than or less than 0.75 inches. In one embodiment, the resulting bead that is<br>
I formed generally has a tensile strength greater than 70 ksi and in certain applications, greater than about<br>
90 ksi. In particular aspects, the melting current can be negative. If the melting current is negative, the<br>
695 metal transferring operation can be performed by a positive current. The metal transferring can however,<br>
be performed by a positive current independent of the melting current. When performing the previously<br>
described method, in one embodiment the average arc length is less than 0.30 inches, and in a fiirther<br>
embodiment is less than 0.20 inches, and in another embodiment is less than 0.10 inches. In an<br>
embodiment of the previously described method, the rate of the short circuit events is automatically<br>
700 controlled. The rate of short circuit events is generally from about 40 to about 100 cycles per second.<br>
In other embodiments, the previously described concepts, i.e. using the power sources and control<br>
techniques in combination with the elecfrode compositions noted herein, can be utilized to produce a weld<br>
metal having a minimum Charpy V-Notch toughness of 60J at -20Â°C. Similarly, the methods can be used<br>
to produce a weld metal having a minimum Charpy V-Notch toughness of 40J at -40Â°C. And, the<br>
705 methods can be used to produce a weld metal having a tensile strength exceeding 90 ksi. Thus, thin pipe<br>
30<br>
of less than about 0.75 inches can be used with the resultant savings. No shielding gas is needed, so the<br>
cost of on site gas is eliminated, or greatly reduced.<br>
The present application can be utilized in a wide array of applications. The system, process,<br>
and/or compositions described herein are particularly adapted for use in welding at least X80 pipe (the<br>
710 designation X80 being in accordance with the API 5L:2000 industry specification) with self-shielded flux<br>
core wire. However, the present invention can be utilized in conjunction with other pipe grades. The<br>
present invention can also be utilized in "root pass" or tack welding operations performed on pipes. The<br>
^ present invention can be utilized to melt greater amounts of welding wire with less arc force as compared<br>
to currently known practices of using a buried short arc for the initial welding pass. Yet another<br>
715 application for the present invention is in robotic welding applications for high speed welding of thin<br>
gauge metals.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The following discussion is directed to an example of the present invention. The present<br>
invention is not limited to the embodiment and results discussed below, but the following discussion is<br>
720 provided to demonstrate the results achievable from an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A series of test welds were made using an embodiment of the present invention, in which a selfshielded,<br>
flux cored electrode was used in a short arc welding process. In some tests a 0.062 inch<br>
diameter Lincoln Innershield NR-233 was used. The welds were made at a constant wire feed speed and<br>
travel speed. The welds were bead on plate welds, having three passes side-by-side, then two passes side-<br>
725 by-side in a second layer on top of the first three passes. The plate surfaces were shot blasted prior to<br>
welding to remove scale and dirt. The weld metal layer in the second layer was analyzed for nitrogen<br>
content. Because no nitrogen was intentionally incorporated in the electrodes used, the following analysis<br>
was (Conducted under the assumption that the nitrogen in the weld metal came from the ambient<br>
atmosphere.<br>
f<br>
I<br>

I I<br>
t\730 Further, the welding power supply was constructed to produce alternating current with variable<br>
waveforms, and the following characteristics of the AC waveform were varied:<br>
"waveform balance" - the waveform balance is the percentage of the AC cycle time when the<br>
electrode polarity is positive; and<br>
"DC offset" - the DC offset is the measure of the degree to which the amplitudes of the positive<br>
735 and negative portions of the waveform are unequal. A DC offset of-20 indicates that the amplitude of the<br>
positive portion of the waveform was 19.4 volts, while the negative portion is 23 volts. Further, +20<br>
^ indicates the reverse, i.e.-23 volts positive and 19.4 volts negative.<br>
FIG. 17 depicts the influence of wave balance and DC offset on weld metal nitrogen recovery in<br>
an example weld performed by an example of the claimed invention. As shovm in FIG. 17, the large data<br>
740 point at 0% wave balance, 0.029% nitrogen recovery, is the result for the weld made with DC- current.<br>
The two welds made at 10% wave balance, +20 DC offset, and the two made at 50% wave balance, -20<br>
DC offset had significantly lower nitrogen recoveries than the DC- weld. Additionally, during testing it<br>
was noted that nitrogen recoveries higher than that observed with DC- were observed with other<br>
combinations of wave balance and DC offset.<br>
745 Further, in additional embodiments the AC waveform can also be manipulated to control levels of<br>
oxygen and hydrogen in the weld metal. Reducing overall levels of contamination reduces the need for<br>
killing, scavenging, or geometry-modifying or solubility-limiting agents. Thus, alloy levels in the selfshielding<br>
electrode can be optimized to achieve optimum physical properties in the weld metal.<br>
The following Tables provide weld data and specifications of a weld example performed in<br>
750 accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this example, a PipelinerÂ® electrode, from<br>
