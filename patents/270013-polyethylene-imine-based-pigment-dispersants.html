Polyethylene imine based pigment dispersants<br>
This invention refers to a novel process for the synthesis of polyethylene imine (PE!)-based pigment dispersants characterized by a "grafting from" approach, allowing the manufacture of solvent based dispersant systems.<br>
The European Patent Publication EPO 208 041B1 describes a dispersant comprising a poly{C2-4-a[l<yleneimine carrying at least two mono- or poly- groups prepared according to the so called process. backbone is poly imine of various molecular weights grafting chain a polyester particularly polylactone which obtained by carboxylic acid initiated ring-opening polymerization lactones caprolactone afterwards these chains are reacted with polyethylene through both quaternization salt bonds and amidification amide reactions between amine groups. bond easily splitted obtain free nh2 resulting in yellowing final resin.></yleneimine>
The PEI initiated ring-opening polymerization of lactone has been briefly mentioned in EPO 208 041 B1, however, EPO 208 041B1 is completely silent as to any further reaction steps of the thus opened lactone.<br>
The key competitive grades are yellowish crystalline solids with low solubility in non-aromatic solvents, and only limited solubility in aromatic solvents.<br>
JP07 025993 discloses a poly(lower aikylene imine) modified lactone graft polymer, obtained by ring-opening polymerisation of a lactone with a poly(lower aikylene imine) with an aikylene chain of 1-6 carbon atoms. The polymer obtained by this process has a backbone of poly(iower aikylene imine) with pending ester groups X1 and X2 linked by amide linkages. JP07 025993 discloses the grafting copoiymerization of caprolactone and PEI, but no further transesterification step. Compared to JP07 025993 the "grafting from" copoiymerization and the transesterification occurs in the present case in sequence (the two-step method) or in-situ (the one-pot method).  to that obtained in JP 07 025993.<br><br>
USS787600 (LubrlzQ]) discloses a dispersant made by either reacting the PAI/PEI with hydroxycarboxylie acids or lactones thereof In a stepwise manner or by reacting PAI/PEI with performed polyester chain. Compared to US6787e00 the present dispersant is made by reacting PA! with carboxylic compounds and lactones, either by a 'two-step" method or by a "one-pot" method.<br>
One aspect of the invention is to provide a dispersant having improved storage stability and improved compatibility in medium polar or non-polar systems. Furthermore the dispersant should show less-yeilowing in white pigment formulations and less viscosity of pigment concentrates.<br>
It has now been found that superior dispersants can be made by the so called "grafting from" process. "Grafting from" means PEI is used as macroinitiator to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of lactones. The products are hydroxy-functionalized grafting copolymers which are further modified. The modified copolymers have at least two types of side chains which are linked to the PEI via an amide bond.   One side chain is OH-terminated, more polar and hydrophiiic and derived from the lactone. This chain can be presented as<br><br><br>
Thus, the invention relates to a polyethylene imine (PEI)-based pigment dispersant of the<br><br>
The polyethylene imine (PEI) may be branched or straight chain having an average molecular weight in the range from 200 to 10O'OOOg/mol. Preferred is PE! with a molecular weight in the range of lOOOg/mol to 50,000g/mol. Water-free versions are preferred.<br>
The group (T)^, or (T)m are poiy(carboxyalkylene oxy) chains (-CO-A-0- )n, m which can be polyesters obtained by ring-opening polymerization of lactones e.g. from epsilon-capro-lactone, gamma-caprolactone, propiolactone, beta-butyrolactone, gamma-butyrolactone, gamma-valeroiactone, delta valerolactone, gamma-decanolactone, delta-decanolactone and the like or from alkyl substituted lactones.<br>
Preferred lactones are epsilon-caprolactone or delta-valerolactone or mixtures thereof. A is therefore preferably C4-C5alkylene.<br><br>
The modifier or terminator residue X is derived from carboxylic acid and/or carboxylic acid ester derivatives, whicli are reacted with the terminal OH-functionality of the grafted chains (T) by esterification {condensation process, water liberated) or transesterification (condensation, alcohol molecule liberated).<br>
Examples of linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aikanecarboxylic acids having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms are acetic acid, caproic acid=hexanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)4COOH, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, methyloctanoic acid, nonanoic add, 3,3,5-isononanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, undecenoic acid, lauric acid= dodecane acid (CH3-(CH2)ioCOOH,   myristic acid, stearic acid and the like.<br>
Examples of unsaturated fatty acids are oleic acid, linolenic add, palmitoleic acid, myristoleic acid, arachidonic acid, or tall oil fatty acid and the like.<br>
Examples of acid esters are methyloleate, butyloleate, octyloleate, mefhylstearate and similar Ci-Ca alkyl esters of saturated and unsaturated linear or branched carboxylic acids as mentioned above.<br>
The term "hydroxycarboxylic acid" refers to monomers having at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one hydroxy group but vi/hich may also include other substituents which do not interfere with the polymerization of the monomer. Examples of suitable substituents on the hydroxycarboxylic acid include e.g. linear, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, linear, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated alkoxy, halo, and the like. Hydroxy¬carboxylic acids are well known in the art of polyester production, and are capable of producing polyester polymers via self-polycondensation polymerization reactions. Examples of suitable hydroxycarboxylic acids include e.g. 12-hydroxystearic acid CH3-(CH2)5-CHOH-(CH2)io-COOH, ricinoleic acid= ([(R)-12-hydroxy-(Z)-9-octadecenoic acid], hydroxycaproic acid and hydroxyacetic acid. I<br>
The chain length of the polyester is 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 10, more preferably l to 5.<br>
Preferred is polyhydroxystearic acid (PHSA), with acid numbers of PHSA preferably between 10and200mgKOH/g,<br><br>
The term "acid terminated poiyether" refers e.g. to succinic anhydride modified (methoxy)-polyall<:yl glycol molecular weights are to g preferably></:yl>
Process:<br>
The PEI-based pigment dispersant of the formula I is prepared based on the "grafting from" approach through either a two step or one pot method.<br>
The process is characterized by<br>
a)	using PEI as macroinitiator to initiate the ring-opening polymerisation of lactones by the<br>
primary amines and the secondary amines of PEI to obtain<br>
P-{T)n-H<br>
b)	(trans)esterification of grafted copolymers with the modifier or terminator X.<br>
In the two-step method, step a) is followed by step b.<br>
In the one-pot method the reaction system is more complex. "Grafting from" copolymerization and (trans)esterification are operated in one pot. The products are obtained in one step.<br>
The product obtained has at least two types of grafted side chains. Preferably at least 50% of the final groups -CO-A-OH of the compound P-(T)n-H are (trans)esterified. These compounds carry at least a side chain attached to the PEI by amid bond which side chain further comprises an ester bond in the chain obtained by the transesterification process.<br>
The chain length of the grafted side chain is determined by the relative molar ratio of used lactone to reactive amine group of PEI. The weight ratio of PEI to lactone monomers ranges from 1:1 to 1:50, therefore the designed MW of polylactones approximately ranges from 100 I     to lO'OOO g/mol. Preferably the weight ratio of PEI to lactone monomers ranges from 1,1 to 1.20, therefore the designed chain length of polylactones approximately ranges from 500 g/mol to 5000 g/mol.<br><br>
Reaction temperatures range from 60 °C to 200 °C under N2 atmosphere for the "grafting from" copolymerization and from 100 X to 200 "C under N2 atmosphere during (trans )esterification.<br>
The {trans)esterification catalyst may be any catalyst suitable in this field. Examples are Tin (II) salts e.g. Tin {II) octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dichtoride, or Tin (IV) compound SnCU, or titanium complexes e.g. tetrabutyltitanate, tetraisopropyltitanate, or aluminum complexes e.g. tris(acetylacetonato)aluminum, (porphinato)aluminum.<br>
Preferably reaction temperatures range from 150 "C to 180 °C under N2 atmosphere.<br>
The pigment dispersants of the formula I preferably have acid numbers of 0 - 50 mg KOH/g, preferably from 0 - 30 mg KOH/g,<br>
The grafting ratio, defined as total reactive amine groups divided by grafted polymer chains<br>
(T), is determined according to the contents of the primary and secondary amino groups in<br>
the PEI molecule.<br>
Grafting efficiency, defined as poiymer grafted divided by total amount of polymer, Is up to<br>
100%.<br>
The grafting density is preferably &gt;30%.<br>
The preferred products have low/er acid number, generally less than 20 mg KOH/g, preferably less than 5 mg KOH/g, which indicates that the linkage of PAI and polyester chain is mainly via amide bonding.<br>
Advantage<br>
The pigment dispersant of the formula I is amphiphilic because the grafted polyester chain is a mixture of hydrophiiic (HO-terminated) and hydrophobic (alky! terminated) polymer chains,      With (trans)esterification, the polarity and therefore the compatibility of the graft copolymer can be adjusted by using various carboxylic acids or hydroxycarboxylic acids.<br><br>
This method enables an enormous flexibility of adjusting the same OH-functional prepolymer to the situation or condition, by choosing the right carboxylic acid or mixture of carboxylic acid derivatives at the end of the process.<br>
The amine-initiated ring-opening polymerisation kinetics is very much faster than the acid initiated polymerisation as presented in the state of the art. The (hydroxy)carboxylic acid materials in the one-pot process also can act as co-catalyst to accelerate the polymerization. Products with good performance can be obtained in a shorter reaction time with less amount of catalyst, which indicates that the manufacturing costs of one-pot 'grafting from' approach are iower.<br>
The products obtained by this invention generally show good compatibility in a wide range of let-down resin systems, e.g. alcohol alkyd, CAB etc. The viscosity of pigment concentrates is lower, indicating the possibility of higher pigment loading; draw-downs and pour-outs of different pigment preparations show high gloss, less flocculation and no seeding.<br>
Due to the complete consumption of reactive free amines in the grafting from approach, considerable less yellowing of white formulations in stoving alcohol alkyd let-downs can be obviously observed. For carbon black pigments like FW 200, the dispersants show very good dispersibility compared to the prior art.<br>
The removal of all reactive amine groups and the amphiphilicity of grafted polyester chains are the origins of many of the obtained effects, while the somewhat more irregular arrangement of the grafted chains lead to a better solubility and less crystallizing behaviour, while using similar monomers as prior arts, where these features are absent.<br>
The storage stability of the product is improved, it appears compatible with most paint systems and shows lower viscosity of pigment concentrates, high gloss and less yellowing of white formulations.<br><br>
USE<br>
The dispersant is used to stabilise pigment dispersions. The moieties being 'grafted from' are polyester side chains, which interact with the resin phase and are necessary to build up a steric environment to stabilize the pigment dispersion. The polyethylene imine part of the polymer has affinity for the pigment surface {anchoring group) and therefore provides a strong physical binding of the dispersant to the solid pigment particle.<br>
The dispersant may be use to stabilize dispersions of pigments and/or fillers for application in coatings, plastics, adhesives, inks and toners, especially Inkjet inks, electronic materials like color filter formulations, construction materials like casting resins, formulations for cosmetics and personal care like nail coatings.<br>
The dispersant may also be used to disperse functional particles like particles to enhance electric or thennal conductivity, e.g. metal particles, graphite, organic and inorganic nano-particies, carbon nanotubes, or magnetic particles, or to disperse charged electrophoretic particles for display applications.<br>
The dispersant may also be used to disperse effect pigments like aluminium flake pigments, mica. The dispersant may also be used for surface modification of pigments, e.g. to improve    easy redispersibility of dry pigment powders.<br>

Performance Screening<br>
In order to test the dispersing performance of tfie synthesized samples, Resin Free Pigment Concentrates were prepared according to the Formulation 1. The mili base was dispersed in Scandex Shaker for 1.5 h with the help of glass beads. Afterwards the mill base was filtered and stored at ambient temperature overnight. Let-downs (Formulation 2) for testing were based on a stoving enamel, a CAB base coat and a coil coating resin. Formulation 3 shows the paint formulations for the stoving enamel and CAB paints. The paint preparation was mixed under high speed stirring for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm, and applied on polyester film with a 35 - 75 pm wet film thickness. After preparing draw-downs, the rest of paints were diluted 1:1 with butyl acetate for a pour-out test. Formulation 4 represents a coil coating, which was applied on steel panel with a black strip, and after a rub-out test, baked for 7 seconds at 320 "C.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 28 - 70 are acid-modified dispersants and tineir performance was tested according to Formulations 1,2,3 and 4. It was observed, that the pigment concentrates flow well and their viscosities were lower than the competitive grade. The rheoiogical behavior of the pigment concentrates was measured with a Thenrro-Haake RheoStress 600 equipment under the CR mode. The initial viscosities (rio) and dynamic viscosities (r|t) of the pigment concentrates are listed In Table 11. According to the viscosity curves, the Pigment White concentrates (PW21) have a Newtonian flow, while the Pigment Black concentrates (Special Black-100) exhibit a pseudoplastic flow. The Pigment Blue concentrates (PB 15:2) have plastic flows and thixotropic properties, but could easily flow under a low shear stress (T, in Table 11). Pigment Black 7 (Black FW 200) was dispersed very well by the products of this invention, but no dispersion was observed by competitive grade.<br><br>
In the stoving enamel paint, the CAB paint and the coil coating, the perfonnance of the dispersants was generally very good with satisfactory results, e.g. high gloss (on average, above 80 at 20°), no seeding, no rub-out, good color strength, and less yellowing of the white pigment (Table 12).<br>
1     In the solubility test, samples were dissolved in various solvents first with a concentration of 50% (w/w). Crystallization of the competitive sample was observed in all the tested solvents<br><br>
after keeping overnight at ambient temperature, wliereas the solution of most of the invention samples showed a long-term stability (Table 13). It indicates that the invention samples are less crystallization, and their compatibility in various solvent systems is better than that of the competitive product. Performance tests also showed that the competitive product is more suitable for apolar systems, but not for polar systems; as a contrast, the products of this invention perfonned well in both polar and apolar systems.<br><br><br><br>
Application in Inks<br>
Competitor B is prepared according to Ex. 48 of US6197877<br>
Laurie acid (10 parts, 0.049M ), epsilon.-caprolactone (67 parts, 0.58M) and delta.-valerolactone (29.4 parts, 0.294M) were stirred under nitrogen and lieated to 105°C. 1 Zirconium isopropoxide (0.45 parts) was added and temperature raised to 170°C, The reactants were stin-ed under nitrogen at tliis temperature for a furttier 6 hours. (78 parts) of the product obtained and polyethyleneimine (6 parts approx. WIW "10,000) were stirred under nitrogen and heated for a further 6 hours.<br><br>
Table 14 shows the compatibility of dispersants with the UV resins/monomers. In general, all<br>
the liquid leads have better compatibility with UV resins/monomers.<br>
Performance of the two liquid dispersant Ex.74 and Ex. 75 were taken as representatives,<br>
and compared to competitor A and B according to the formulation A.     The results (gloss<br>
and transparency) were shown  in Table  15;  Table  16 lists the storage stability of<br>
dispersants, which were characterized by viscosity of PCs,<br>
All above results indicate that the invention products show better or compatible performance<br>
to competitor A and B.<br><br>
