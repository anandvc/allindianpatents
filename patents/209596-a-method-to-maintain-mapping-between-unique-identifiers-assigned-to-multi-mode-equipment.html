FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to wireless networks. Further, this invention relates to maintenance of a mapping between various identifiers used by the multi-mode access equipment to access different networks. More particularly, this invention relates to a method to maintain mapping between unique identifiers assigned to multi-mode equipment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The multi-mode Access Terminal (AT) supporting both 1x and HRPD standard uses different identifiers to talk on respective networks. For cross paging between these two networks, it is mandatory to keep a mapping between the two at the network level. Currently, both networks have the knowledge about the identifiers used with their link only.<br>
Current management of IMSI or UATI in 1x and HRPD networks respectively is done independently. HRPD network has no knowledge of IMSI and similarly 1x network does not know about the UATI assigned to the multimode AT. Therefore, in the said circumstances, cross paging would not possible between HRPD and 1x. Further, the hybhd AT has to keep looking at 1x control channel for getting pages destined for itself when in HRPD network. Moreover, no method is presently available to inform the network of the movement to the other network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method to maintain the mapping between various unique identifiers associated with multi-mode AT to access different radio access technologies. This mapping is mandated at network in order to facilitate the cross paging between the access technologies that multi-mode AT supports.<br><br>
It is another object of this invention to invent a method for maintenance of IMSI and UATI, the unique identifiers used in 1x and HRPD networks respectively with IMSI being the pivot as UATI is a temporary identifier.<br>
The invention relates in general to inter-RAT handovers in wireless domain and in particular to handoff between HRPD and 1x networks. For facilitating these handoffs and cross paging, a mapping is required at the network side between the different identifiers used on the involved networks.<br>
Both CDMA2000 1x and HRPD (also known as EVDO) are deployed widely in many parts of the world. The advantages of HRPD are the high data rate and its customization to increase efficiency to cater for data only. At the other hand 1x is widely present and caters to the basic and mostly used voice services and data also. If the best of both networks can be utilized in the deployed areas, then a much better service can be provided to the end users. This invention provides for a method to maintain the mapping between UATI (identifier at HRPD) and IMSI (identifier at 1x).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will  now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the<br><br>
disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in vahous forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Before describing the various aspects and details of the present invention it will be useful to deschbe the context in which the invention is used. Consequently, a preliminary discussion that refers to Figures 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 is hereby provided.<br>
Figure 1 shows the current network architecture with hybrid AT. The AT maintains two separate stacks and the interaction between air interfaces for the two is nonexistent. The HAT uses UATI as identifier on the HRPD network and IMSI as an identifier on the 1x network. The correlation between IMSI and UATI is known only to HAT and no entity on the network side is aware of this mapping in this current architecture. The coordination between the two networks is done at the HAT level only and thus it looks for both the network messages by doing time multiplexing.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 it shows the network architecture with a proposed new node named IWS (Interworking Solution) to handle cross interactions between the two kinds of network interfaces. 201 refers to the new network entity i.e. Interworking Solution (IWS) that will be a part of the HRPD RAN. The IWS interfaces to the MSC via an lOS A1 interface, and also to the SC/MM via a new H1 interface. The SC/MM may be located in either the AN or the PCF in the EVDO RAN. The primary function of the IWS is to translate A1 messages to CDMA 2000 LAC messages, which are then sent to the SC/MM for eventual transmission to the HAT. If the SC/MM is located in the AN, the AN will send the message directly to the HAT using the 3G1x Services Notification Application protocol. If the SC/MM is in the PCF, the SC/MM must first send the CDMA 2000 LAC message to the AN over the A14 interface.<br><br>
Likewise, messages received from the HAT (such as Connection Request messages) by the AN may result in the SC/MM sending update messages to the IWS; the IWS may then send an A1 1oS message (e.g. Location Updating Request) to the MSC.<br>
202 refers to the new interface between the IWS and the SC/MM. The protocol stack is based on TCP/IP, with a I OS layer above that. Messages carry the encapsulated 3G LAC messages for delivery to the SC/MM; also carries information from the SC/MM to the iWS. This interface connects the IWS to the SC/MM in the HRPD architecture. The interface is IP-based and carries 3G1X LAC encapsulated PDUs in an lOS-defined protocol. The H1 interface is an IP-based interface. The Figure 2 shows the protocol stacks for the architecture based on TIA-878. A similar figure can be created for the architecture based on TIA-1878; the only change would be that the SC/MM would be in the PCF, and there would be an A14 interface between the PCFandtheAN.<br>
Figure 3 shows UATI and IMSI mapping call flow for TIA-878 architecture. It is explained in detail later with reference to this figure. 301 is a new step introduced at HRPD AN. The HRPD AN has to register the AT at end of UATI assignment procedure with the IWS. 302 is the new step at AT and AT needs to trigger sending of registration message of 1x with IMSI as identifier. 303: The IWS extracts the IMSI from encapsulated registration message and maintains the IMSI-UATI mapping.<br>
Figure 4 shows UATI and IMSI mapping for TIA-1878 architecture. It is explained in detail later with reference to this figure. 401 is a new step introduced at PCF. The PCF has to register the AT at end of UATI assignment procedure with the IWS. 402 is the new step at AT and AT needs to trigger sending of registration message of 1x with IMSI as identifier. 403: The IWS extracts the IMSI from encapsulated registration message and maintains the IMSI-UATI mapping.<br>
Messages on HI interface those are required for attaining the mapping between IMSI and UATI are as follows.<br><br>
IWS RecvFrame<br><br>
MSGJD       The message identifier set to 0x01 by IWS.<br>
ATID	The unique identifier to distinguish this message is for which AT.<br>
In case of HRPD system, this ID can be set to UATI.<br>
ACK_REQD This bit is set to 1 by IWS if an ack is mandated for this 1x packet.<br>
SEQ_NUM   The sequence number for acknowledgement purpose. This field is present only if ACK_REQD is set to 1.<br>
PDU_LENGTH        Length of 1x LAC PDU.<br>
RESERVED To make the message octet aligned. It is set to 0.<br>
1x LAC PDU The IWS forms and put the 1x LAC PDU of required 1x message like GPM, DBM etc..<br>
IWSRegistrationInd<br><br><br><br>
MSGJD       The message identifier set to 0x05 by HRPD.<br>
ATID	The unique identifier to distinguish this message is for which AT.<br>
In case of HRPD system, this ID can be set to UATI.<br>
RESERVED This field is set to 0 and is present to make the message octet aligned.<br>
IWSRegistrationAck<br><br>
MSGJD       The message identifier set to 0x03 by IWS.<br>
ATID	The unique identifier to distinguish this message is for which AT.<br>
In case of HRPD system, this ID can be set to UATI.<br>
Mapping maintenance call flow:<br>
Note: Following convention is used with call flows:<br>
Each step is identified by two a letter and a numeric like Xn, where X can take on<br>
following values:<br>
A Hybrid AT H HRPD AN M        1xMSC<br><br>
P	PCF<br>
B	1xBSC<br>
I	IWS<br>
And n is a numeric value stating the nth step at that node. For e.g. A2 means step 2 at hybrid AT in the call context.<br>
The call flow for the maintenance of mapping for TIA-878 architecture is as shown in figure 3.<br>
A1       AT sends a UATIRequest message.<br>
H1      HRPD AN generates a UATI and assigns it to AT via UATIAssignment<br>
message. A2      UATI is assigned to AT and it sends UATIComplete message to HRPD AN. H2      HRPD AN sends IWS Registartion ind message with UATI.<br>
II	IWS stores the UATI and its context as to which HRPD AN it is connected to.<br>
Config negotiation procedures are carried out and 3G1x Notification service is negotiated along with other parameters for the AT.<br>
A3      AT triggers sending of 1x Registration message on 3G1x notification<br>
application. The LAC PDU contains the IMSI value in address sublayer fields. H3      The HRPD AN forwards the 3G1x packet to IWS in IWS recv frame message<br>
with UATI. 12       IWS gets the UATI and looks into the 1x message. As the 1x message is<br>
Registration, it takes out IMSI and populates its structures for UATI and IMSI<br>
mapping.<br>
The mapping is maintained with IMSI as reference (as UATI is temporary id).<br>
So whenever UATI is (re)assigned, the hybrid AT sends a 1x registration message with IMSI and IWS updates the table i.e. if an entry exists with this IMSI, it is overwritten or else a new entry is created.<br><br>
For the alternate HRPD architecture viz. TIA-1878 architecture is as shown in figure 4.<br>
A1      AT sends a UATIRequest message.<br>
H1      HRPD AN generates a UATI and assigns it to AT via UATIAssignment<br>
message. Starts T14-UAT1-Req timer. P1      PCF generates a UATI and sends it to HRPD AN in A14-UATIAssignment<br>
message. H2      HRPD AN sends the assigned UATI to AT in UATIAssignment message.<br>
Stops T14-UATI-Req timer. A2      UATI is assigned to AT and it sends UATIComplete message to HRPD AN. H3      Sends A14-UATIComplete message to PCF. Starts T14-UATI-Comp timer. P2      PCF sends A14 UATICompleteAck to HRPD AN and IWS Registartion ind<br>
message with UATI to IWS over H1 interface. H4      Stops T14-UATI-Comp timer.<br>
11	IWS stores the UATI and its context as to which PCF it is connected to.<br>
Configuration negotiation procedures are carried out and 3G1x Notification service is negotiated along with other parameters for the AT.<br>
A3      AT  triggers  sending   of  1x  Registration   message  on   3G1x   notification<br>
application.<br>
The LAC PDU contains the IMSI value in address sublayer fields. H5      The HRPD AN forwards the 3G1x packet to PCF in A14-IWS recv frame<br>
message with UATI. P3      PCF forwards the 3G1x packet to IWS in IWS recv frame message with<br>
UATI.<br>
12	IWS gets the UATI and looks into the 1x message. As the 1x message is<br>
Registration, it takes out IMSI and populates its structures for UATI and<br>
IMSI   mapping.<br><br>
The mapping is maintained with IMSI as reference (as UATI is temporary id).<br>
So whenever UATI is (re)assigned, the hybrid AT sends a 1x registration message with IMSI and IWS updates the table i.e. if an entry exists with this IMSI, it is overwritten or else a new entry is created.<br>
