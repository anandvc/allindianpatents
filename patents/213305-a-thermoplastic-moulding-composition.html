"A THERMOPLASTIC MOULDING COMPOSITION<br><br>
n<br><br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,  a company of Germany,  of D-51368 Leverkusen, GERMANY<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
19-5-2005.<br>
19 MAY 2005<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a thermoplastic moulding composition..<br>
Thermoplastic moulding compositions, especially those containing homo- and/or co¬polymers of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers, polycarbonates and polyesters, are known from a large number of publications. This is true especially of the use of ABS polymers. Reference is made to the following documents solely by way of example: DE-A-196 16 963, WO 97/40 092, EP-A-728 811, EP-A-315 868 (= US-A-4.937.285), EP-A-0 174 493 (US-A-4 983 658), US-A-5 030 675, JA-59 202 240, EP-A-0 363 608 "(= US-A-5 204 394), EP-A-0-767 204, EP-A-0 611 798, WO 96/27 600, EP-A-0 754 531. <br>
It is known from the prior art to filter polymer lattices in order to remove impurities or coarse portions. For example,. Houben Weyl XTV/1, Makromolekulare Stoffe 1, . pages 348 to 356 (Georg Thieme Veriag, Stuttgart,T961) and DE-A-4 126 483 and US-A-4 747 959 describe the filtration of rubber lattices. Connections with the mechanical properties are not known from that prior art.<br>
Thermoplastic moulding compositions haying a particle diameter of from 0.20 to 0.35 μm are known from EP-A-0 704 488. A connection with elongation at tear, thermostability, natural shade and notched bar impact strength is not to be found in that prior art.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to make available homo- and/or co-polymers which are distinguished by improved mechanical properties, especially in respect of elongation at tear, thermostability, natural shade and notched bar impact strength, and by an especially consistent product quality.<br><br><br><br>
That object is achieved by homo- and/or co-polymers of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers ("vinyl monomers") selected from the group of the mono- or poly-unsaturated olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, chloroprene, 1,3-butadiene, isopropene, vinyl acetate, styrene, a-methylstyrene, styrenes substituted at the nucleus, vinyl cyanides, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylomtrile, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimides, C1-C8-alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, such as methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, which contain 
The coarse portion of the homo- and/or co-polymers having mean particle diameters of from 100 to 200 urn is preferably less than 1000 ppm. Special preference is given to coarse portions of 
In the case of mean particle diameters of from 50 to 100 μm, the coarse portion of the homo- and/or co-polymers is preferably 
The mean particle diameter of the homo- and/or co-polymers used is preferably from 0.04 to 1 μm, preferably from 0.1 to 0.6 μm.<br>
The mean particle diameter d50 (also called the particle size) is the diameter above and below which in each case 50 wt.% of the particles lie. It can be determined by means of ultracentrifuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-796).<br><br><br>
According to the invention, the above-mentioned homopolymers or copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomers are used. Mixtures of various homo- and/or co¬polymers are also suitable.<br>
There are suitable especially:<br>
rubber-free vinyl polymers (A. 1),<br>
rubber-containing vinyl polymers, e.g. graft polymers of vinyl monomers with a rubber (A.2),<br>
mixtures of rubber-free (A. 1) and rubber-containing (A.2) vinyl polymers.<br>
Preferred vinyl polymers A.l are copolymers of, on the one hand, styrene, cc-methyl-styrene, styrene substituted at the  nucleus, or mixtures thereof (A. 1.1) and, on the other hand, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, (meth)acrylic acid CrC8-alkyl esters, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimide, or mixtures thereof (A. 1.2).<br>
The copolymers can contain preferably from 50 to 98 wt.% of A. 1.1 and from 50 to 2wt.% of A.1.2.<br>
Especially preferred copolymers A.l are those of styrene, acrylonitrile and, optionally, methyl methacrylate, of a-methylstyrene, acrylonitrile and, optionally, methyl methacrylate, and of styrene, a-methylstyrene, acrylonitrile and, optionally, methyl methacrylate.<br>
The most well known are styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, which can be prepared by radical polymerisation, especially by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass<br>
polymerisation. The copolymers A.l preferably have molecular weights M w (weight average, calculated by light scattering or sedimentation) of from 15,000 to 200,000.<br><br><br>
Other especially preferred copolymers A.l are randomly constructed copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride, which can be prepared from the corresponding monomers, for example, by continuous mass or solution polymerisation with incomplete conversions. Their composition can be varied within wide limits. Preferably they contain from 5 to 25 wt.% of maleic anhydride units.<br>
Instead of styrene, these polymers may also contain styrenes substituted at the nucleus, such as p-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene and other substituted styrenes, such as a-methylstyrene.<br>
The rubber-containing vinyl polymers A.2 include, for example, graft (co)polymers having elastomeric properties, which are obtainable substantially from at least two of the following monomers: chloroprene, 1,3-butadiene, isopropene, styrene, a-methylstyrene, acrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, vinyl acetate, C1-C8-alkyl acrylates and methacrylates. Such polymers are described, for example, in "Methoden der Organischen Chemie" (Houben-Weyl), Vol. 14/1, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1961, p. 393-406, and in C.B. Bucknall, "Toughened Plastics", Appl. Science Publishers, London 1977. In general, the polymers A.2 are partially crosslinked and generally have gel contents of over 20 wt.%, preferably over 40 wt.%.<br>
Preferred rubber-like vinyl polymers A.2 are graft polymers of:<br>
A.2.1	from 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably from 30 to 80 parts by<br>
weight, of a mixture of<br>
A.2.1.1	from 50 to 95 parts by weight of styrene, a-methylstyrene, styrenes<br>
substituted at the nucleus by halogen or by methyl, (meth)acrylic acid C1-C8-alkyl esters, or mixtures of these compounds, and<br><br><br>
A.2.1.2	from 5 to 50 parts by weight of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile,<br>
(meth)acrylic acid C1-C8-alkyl esters, maleic anhydride, maleimides N-substituted by C1-C4-alkyl or by phenyl, or mixtures of these compounds, with<br>
A.2.2	from 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably from 20 to 70 parts by<br>
weight, of rubber polymer having a glass transition temperature below -10°C.<br>
Preferred graft polymers A.2 are, for example, polybutadienes grafted with styrene and/or acrylonitrile and/or alkyl acrylates or methacrylates, butadiene/styrene copolymers and acrylate rubbers; i.e. copolymers of the type described in DE-OS 1 694 173 (= US-A-3 564 077); polybutadienes grafted with acrylic or methacrylic acid alkyl esters, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene and/or alkylstyrenes, butadiene/styrene or butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, polyisobutene or polyisoprene, as are described, for example, in DE-OS 2 348 377 (= US-A 3 919 353).<br>
Especially preferred polymers A.2 are ABS polymers, as are described, for example, in DE-OS 2 035 390 (= US-A-3 644 574) and in DE-OS 2 248 242 (= GB-B 1 409 275).<br>
Special preference is given according to the invention to graft rubbers having rubber contents of at least 50 wt.%, preferably at least 55 wt.%.<br>
Especially preferred graft polymers A.2 are obtainable by graft polymerisation of<br>
from 10 to 70 wt.%, preferably from 15 to 50 wt.%, especially from 20 to 40 wt.%, based on graft polymer A.2, of acrylic acid esters or methacrylic<br><br><br>
acid esters, or from 10 to 70 wt.%, preferably from 15 to 50 wt.%, especially from 20 to 40 wt.%, of a mixture of from 10 to 50 wt,%, preferably from 20 to 35 wt.%, based on the mixture, of acrylonitrile, acrylic acid esters or methacrylic acid esters, and from 50 to 90 wt.%, preferably from 65 to 80 wt.%, based on the mixture, of styrene or styrenes substituted at the nucleus, or a mixture thereof (as the graft overlay A.2.1) with<br>
p. from 30 to 90 wt.%, preferably from 50 to 85 wt.%, especially from 60 to 80 wt.%, based on graft polymer A.2, of a butadiene polymer having at least 50 wt.%, based on p, of butadiene radicals (as the graft base A.2.2).<br>
In general, the gel content of the graft base ß is at least 20 wt.% (measured in toluene), and the degree of grafting G is from 0.15 to 0.55.<br>
Acrylic acid esters or methacrylic acid esters a are esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and monohydric alcohols having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Special preference is given to methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate and tert-butyl methacrylate.<br>
In addition to butadiene radicals, the butadiene polymer ß can contain up to 50 wt.%, based on p, of radicals of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, acrylonitrile, C1-C4-alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid (such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), vinyl esters and/or vinyl ethers). Polybutadiene is preferred.<br>
It is known that in the graft polymerisation, the graft monomers are not polymerised on to the graft base completely; according to the invention, however, graft polymers A,2 include products obtained by polymerisation of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base.<br><br><br>
Other especially preferred polymers A.2 are graft polymers of<br>
x.        from 20 to 90 wt.%, based on A.2, of acrylate rubber having a glass transition temperature below -20°C as the graft base A.2.2, and<br>
8.        from  10 to  80 wt.%, based on A.2,  of at least one polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomer, as the graft monomer A.2.1.<br>
The acrylate rubbers of the polymers A.2 are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally having up to 40 wt.%, based on x, of other polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The preferred polymerisable acrylic acid esters include C1-C12-alkyl esters, preferably C1-C8-alkyl esters, for example methyl-, ethyl-, butyl-, n-octyl- and 2-ethyl-hexyl esters; haloalkyl esters, preferably halo-C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as chloroethyl acrylate, as well as mixtures of these monomers.<br>
For crosslinking, monomers having more than one polymerisable double bond may be copolymerised. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxyhc acids having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and of unsaturated monohydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms or of saturated polyols having from 2 to 4 OH groups and from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as, for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as, for example, trivinyl and triallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as di- and tri-vinylbenzenes; and also triallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate.<br>
Preferred crosslinking monomers are allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl phthalate and heterocyclic compounds having at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups.<br><br><br>
Especially preferred crosslinking monomers are the cyclic monomers triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, trivinyl cyanurate, triacryloylhexahydro-s-triazine, triallylbenzenes.<br>
The amount of crosslinking monomers is preferably from 0.02 to 5 wt.%, especially from 0.05 to 2 wt.%, based on the graft base T.<br>
In the case of cyclic crosslinking monomers having at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups it is advantageous to restrict the amount to less than 1 wt.% of the graft base z.<br>
Preferred "other" polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers which, in addition to the acrylic acid esters, may optionally be used for the preparation of the graft base are, for example, acrylonitrile, styrene, a-methylstyrene, acrylamides, vinyl-C1-C6-alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate, butadiene. Preferred acrylate rubbers as graft base T are emulsion polymers having a gel content of at least 60 wt.%.<br>
Other suitable graft bases according to A.2.2 are silicone rubbers having graft-active sites, as are described, for example, in DE-OS 37 04 657, DE-OS 37 04 655, DE-OS 36 31 540 and DE-OS 36 31 539.<br>
The gel content of the graft base A.2.2 is determined at 25°C in dimethylformamide (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I und n, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
The graft polymers A.2 can be prepared by known processes, such as mass, suspension, emulsion or mass-suspension processes.<br><br><br>
According to the invention, filtration over a filter having a mean mesh size of 
It is also preferred that the mean mesh size should not be less than 50 μm; since, if the mesh sizes are too small, there is the risk that the transverse forces will be too high. Moreover, the speed of filtration is slowed to such an extent that the outlay in terms of time becomes too high or the throughput is reduced too greatly.<br>
Any known materials may be considered for the filters. These include, for example, metals or fabrics of any kind.<br>
The homo- and/or co-polymers according to the invention prepared by means of the described filtration are distinguished by a significant improvement in their mechanical properties. In particular, the elongation at tear, natural shade, thermostability and notched bar impact strength are improved to a degree which was not foreseeable. Moreover, they have a surprisingly consistent product quality.<br>
According to the invention, the described homo- and/or co-polymers can be partially replaced by other thermoplastic polymers. The other thermoplastic polymers are preferably selected from at least one thermoplastic polymer from the group of the polycarbonates, polyester carbonates, polyesters, preferably polyalkylene terephthalates, and conventional (co)polymers according to the above-described component A.l, but without the coarse portion of particles according to the invention.<br><br><br>
The moulding composition according to the invention may also contain other additives selected from at least one of the group of the flameproofing agents, anti-dripping agents, very finely divided inorganic compounds and filling and reinforcing materials.<br>
The thermoplastic moulding compositions preferably contain<br>
A.	from 0.5 to 60 parts by weights, preferably from 1 to 40 parts by<br>
weight, of the homo-and/or co-polymers according to the invention,<br>
B.	from 40 to 99 parts by weight, preferably from 50 to 95 parts by<br>
weight, of polycarbonates and/or polyester carbonates,<br>
C.	from 5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 30 parts by weight,<br>
especially from 2 to 25 parts by weight, of copolymers of styrene, a-<br>
methylstyrene, styrene substituted at the nucleus, or mixtures<br>
thereof, and acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, (meth)acrylic and C1-C8-<br>
alkyl esters, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimides, or mixtures<br>
thereof,<br>
D.	from 0 to 45 parts by weight, preferably from 0 to 30 parts by weight,<br>
especially from 0 to 25 parts by weights, or polyalkylene<br>
terephthalate.<br>
The sum of all the components of the moulding compositions according to the invention is 100.<br>
The composition of the present invention is neither a mere admixture nor a product of chemical product but a synergistic mixture exhibiting unexpected and surprising properties.<br>
Some of component A may be replaced by conventional ABS polymers.<br>
Suitable polycarbonates  and/or polyester carbonates  are known from the literature or can be prepared by processes which are known from the literature (for the preparation of aromatic polycarbonates see, for example,  Schnell, Chemistry and<br><br><br>

derivatives, such as, for example, 2,2-bis(3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane, 2,2-<br>
bis(3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane	or	2,2-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)-propane.<br>
Special preference is given to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (bisphenol A).<br>
The diphenols can be used singly or in the form of any desired mixtures.<br>

Components A-C are mixed using a 3 litre kneader. The moulded bodies are produced using an Arburg 270 E injection moulding machine at 260°C.<br>
The notched bar impact strength is determined according to method ISO 1801 A using rods measuring 80 x 10 x 4 mm at room temperature.<br>
The elongation at tear DR is determined within the framework of the determination of the modulus of elasticity in tension according to method ISO 527 using F3 shoulder rods.<br>
The yellowness index is determined in accordance with ASTM D 1925.<br>
In the case of the thermostability, specimen plates (60 x 40 x 2 mm) are injection-moulded at a tool temperature of 80°C and a composition temperature of from 260 to 300°C. The composition temperature is reached in 10°C steps; the dwell time of the composition in the cylinder is 6 minutes.<br><br><br>
A visual assessment of the surface is carried out according to the following criteria:<br>
Symbol	Assessment<br>
0	not tested<br>
1	i.o., smooth surface, no cracks<br>
2	traces of disintegration, smooth surface, small, just visible cracks<br>
3	minimal disintegration, smooth surface, up to 5 blistered cracks<br>
4	slight disintegration, smooth surface, from 5 to 10 blistered cracks<br>
5	moderate disintegration, cracked blistered surface, approximately half still smooth<br>
6	severe disintegration, cracked surface, still smooth areas visible<br>
7	very severe disintegration, foam-like condition<br>
8	foam formation, sputters from nozzle, cannot be injection-moulded<br><br>
