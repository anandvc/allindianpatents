				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for a stitching or a sewing machine<br>
comprising a thread driving mechanism hiving a roller mounted for rotating<br>
about an axis, said roller driven by the drive unit in both directions about the<br>
axis thereof; and a feed spool for winding off an upper thread for thread feed<br>
or loop formation, by turning said roller in one direction, and pulling back the<br>
upper thread for thread withdrawal by rotating the roller in the opposite<br>
direction, thus drawing the stitch or loop; as well as a process using the device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
A device is known from EP-PS0014897, in the case of which a roller looped by<br>
the needle threads is equipped with a drive, which pre-sets the advance and pull<br>
back direction of the roller independently of the thread tension and in the case of<br>
which the thread guides are also omitted, because the thread length released<br>
and again withdrawn by these is likewise advanced and pulled back by the driven<br>
roller. The function of the mechanism indicated in this document is limited to<br>
simulating the stitching process in such a way as known from conventional<br>
shuttle sewing machines according to DE-PS 3416266. The process is further<br>
based on creating a thread tension in the needle thread during the stitching<br>
process. In particular, EP-PS 0014897 discloses that the completed stitch is<br>
tightened by reversing the roller after the stitch formation, whereby the needle<br>
thread is tensioned (page 4, column 6, Iines 25 to 28). This process again leads<br>
to stress in the needle threads, which limits the operating speed and results in<br>
the occurrence of thread breakages. In the case of the device described in EP-<br>
PS 0014897, there is no control regarding possible thread breakages in particular<br>
of the upper or lower thread . Rather, the thread feed and in particular the<br>
thread withdrawal are permanently pre-set by the control system. The thread<br>
tension is not checked during the stitching process in the case of this<br>
device. For example, if disturbances arise during the stitching process.<br>
then the force-actuatod thread withdrawal automatically<br>
leads to thread breakage.<br>
EP 0666351 discloses a process and a device for embroidering<br>
on a shuttle sewing machine, in the case of which a thread<br>
guide and a feed unit supply the length of thread necessary<br>
for the needle to penetrate the fabric, for loop formation<br>
for the shuttle to pass through the loop and the thread<br>
length to be applied or. the embroidery foundation for stit<br>
formation, whereby the needle thread is kept virtually<br>
stress-free curing the entire stitch formation and the<br>
stitch is only tightened due to the wind-off force of the<br>
shuttle thread. The process and device described in EP<br>
0666351 cannot be transposed to a stitching or sewing<br>
machine, in the case of which the upper thread must be<br>
always pulled back or tightened by the thread withdrawal for<br>
the loop or stitch formation and thus is continually under<br>
stress.<br>
DE 3839733 describes a stitch-forming machine with a sensor<br>
to measure the tension contained in a thread, commising a<br>
control device via which the tension is evaluated during<br>
individual phases of the stitch formation. By means of this<br>
device, the tension in the needle thread can be easily<br>
determined/ whereby if there is too much tension the stitch<br>
formation process is interrupted and suitable counter<br>
measures can be taken.<br>
The object of the present invention is to further develop a<br>
stitching or sewing machine to the effect that the loop or<br>
stitch formation in the individual working phases of the<br>
stitching or sewing machine is optimized by optimum thread<br>
tension. Furthermore, it is proposed that a stitching or<br>
sewing machine is further developed to the effect that the<br>
thread feed and in particular thread withdrawal are<br>
optimized, so that in particular fewer thread breakages<br>
occur.<br>
This object is ingeniously achieved with a device according<br>
to the features of claim 1. Further advantageous embodiments<br>
are clear from the features of the dependent claims 2 to 28.<br>
Furthermore, a process is claimed using a device according<br>
to claims 1 to 28, which serves to execute an optimiz<br>
stitching or sewing process. Advantageously, the process<br>
according to claim 29 is further expanded by the features of<br>
claims 30 to 33,<br>
Advantageously, the device measures the tension in the upper<br>
thread during thread withdrawal by means of measuring<br>
device, whereby the measured tension is considered by the<br>
control system of the device, meaning that it is checked<br>
whether the stitch process is being properly executed. If a<br>
deviation in the thread tension is detected, the control<br>
system of the device or the stitching or sewing machine<br>
determines whether the thread tension is too much or too<br>
little for the particular stitching or sewing process.<br>
Depending on the evaluated thread tension signal, the thread<br>
drive' mechanism is controlled accordingly during thread<br>
withdrawal. Thus, advantageously, thread withdrawal can be<br>
terminated for example, if the level of the determined<br>
thread tension exceeds a calculated pre-set tension<br>
threshold value. This tension threshold value, for example,<br>
can be variable and advantageously depends on the thread to<br>
be stitched (type and strength), the foundation to be<br>
embroidered as well as on the kind of stitch. The stitching<br>
or sewing machine can also be stopped with the thread<br><br>
withdrawal, so that, for example, the operatives can<br>
manually rectify any problems arising during the stitching<br>
process. Likewise, the sewing or stitching machine can begin<br>
the next stitch formation immediately after the current<br>
stitching process has finished. If the thread threshold<br>
value is exceeded during this stitch or loop formation, the<br>
sewing or stitching machine can also be stopped by the<br>
control system.<br>
It is equally possible to increase the speed of the thread<br>
advance so that the thread tension is reduced. Likewis , it<br>
is possible to wind off less thread, if too much upper<br>
thread is present when the lower thread is fed through the<br>
loop formed by the upper thread, so that the thread tennson<br>
in the upper thread assumes higher values. The direct<br>
control of thread advance or thread withdrawal ensures that<br>
the speed of the thread advance and thread withdrawal and<br>
the speed of the needle are generally coordinated with one<br>
another, and that too much tension does not arise in the<br>
upper thread. Thus, for example, it is possible that after<br>
the loop has been formed, the upper thread is shortened by<br>
knot formation, so that less thread has to be pulled back in<br>
order to tighten the loop or the stitch with the necessary<br>
tension. In the event of such an occurrence with<br>
conventional stitching or sewing machines, a thread breakage<br>
would inevitably occur, unless these comprise a thread<br>
tension measuring device according to DE 3839733, whereby<br>
this occurrence would then inevitably lead to stoppage of<br>
the machine. Since the thread tension-measuring device<br>
according to DE 3839733 would only emit a signal that the<br>
maximum permissible upper thread tension had been exceeded,<br>
so that the stitching machine would be inevitably stopped.<br>
The device according to the invention however, through<br>
direct control of thread withdrawal, would pull back less<br>
thread, so that the permissible tension in the upper thread<br>
is not exceeded, thereby preventing thread breakage and<br>
stoppage of the stitching or sewing machine. At the same<br>
time, the optimum thread upper tension can be obtained<br>
during the loop or stitch formation by means of the device.<br>
Advantageously/ the optimum thread upper tension can be<br>
controlled by means of an appropriate regulation algorithm.<br>
Advantageously, the device-also reduces the speed/ at which<br>
the upper thread is withdrawn, if the thread upper tension<br>
approaches a calculable or pre-definable tension threshold<br>
value. Thereby good regulation characteristics are obtained<br>
and thread breakage is reliably prevented.<br>
Advantageously, it is possible with the device according to<br>
the invention to detect upper thread and also lower thread<br>
breakages. This is due to the fact that during the entire<br>
stitching or sewing process, the tension of the upper thread<br>
just stitched is monitored by the device. As a result, it is<br>
possible to recognize whether the tension in the upper<br>
thread exceeds or falls below certain threshold values at<br>
certain times during the stitch or loop formation.<br>
Thus, on the one hand, it is possible that, during the<br>
passage of the lower thread through the thread loop produced<br>
underneath the stitching foundation by means of the shuttle,<br>
the thread tension does not exceed an inadmissible level. If<br>
the thread tension exceeds the tension threshold value for<br>
example by means of the thread drive mechanism further<br>
thread can be made available, so that the loop is<br>
sufficiently large for the shuttle with the lower thread<br>
spool located in it to safely pass through the loop.<br>
Furthermore, in this case the maximum permissible thread<br>
length can be considered. If, for example, further thread is<br>
wound off by the thread drive mechanism to reduce the thread<br>
upper tension, it must be ensured that this does not<br>
continue for an infinitely long period. Rather, it must be<br>
ensured that the stitching process is interrupted after a<br>
certain length of additional thread, since a critical error<br>
has arisen.<br>
On the other hand, lower thread breakages can be reliably<br>
detected if a certain tension threshold value is not reached<br>
when a first tension peak occurs. Thus, the upper thread is<br>
slightly tensioned by pulling the lower thread through the<br>
loop formed by the upper thread, so that the tension in the<br>
upper thread increases while being pulled through in order<br>
thereafter to drop again. If the tension threshold value has<br>
not been exceeded, then this is rated as thread breakage.<br>
Likewise, however, this can also mean that too much thread<br>
has been advanced for the loop formation. The latter case<br>
can be determined, for example, by thread withdrawal within<br>
the time frame, in which the shuttle passes through the loop<br>
of the upper thread. If the tension does not increase within<br>
this time frame, then it can be concluded that the lower<br>
thread has broken.<br>
Advantageously, the control electronics of the device i.e.<br>
the sewing or stitching machine, in the event of any of the<br>
aforementioned scenarios in each case checks the steps taken<br>
to resduce the tension in the upper thread for their<br>
plausibility.<br>
Advantageously, the thread drive mechanism of the device<br>
according to the invention serves to advance or transport<br>
several upper threads of a multi-head sewing or stitching<br>
machine. For this purpose, the roller turned by the drive<br>
can be moved parallel to the surface of the stitching<br>
foundation and pressed against rollers, around which the<br>
individual upper threads are fed separately in each case, so<br>
that the individual rollers looped by the upper threads can<br>
be rotated alternatively after one another by means of the<br>
roller. By changing the rotating direction of the driven<br>
roller either thread is advanced or, however, the upper<br>
thread is withdrawn.<br>
A further advantageous configuration of the device according<br>
to the invention arises if a thread reversing device is used<br>
to measure the tension of the upper thread just stitched or<br>
sewn. For this purposs, at least one sensor records the<br>
deformation or excursion of the thread reversing device from<br>
its original position. From the amount of deformation or<br>
excursion control electronics can easily determine the<br>
tension in the upper threaa currently being sewn or<br>
stitched. Since all upper threads of the multi-threa<br>
stitching or sewing machine are reversed by the thread<br>
reversing mechanism, advantageously only a few or only one<br>
sensor is needed to determine the respective thread tensions<br>
of the individual upper threads being stitched alternatively<br>
after one another.<br>
Advantageously, the thread reversing mechanism is a U-shaped<br>
part, which is fixed to the stitching head at its two ends<br>
in each case via intermediate parts. The intermediate parts<br>
can be configured at an angle, so that the reversing<br>
mechanism is somewhat offset from the front plate of the<br>
stitching head and thus leverage forces can be used to bend<br>
the angular brackets or the one angular bracket.<br><br>
Advantageously, this is formed with a thin wall in one area<br>
for easier bending of an angular bracket. Advantageously, in<br>
this thin-walled area the deformation can be recorded by<br>
means of wire strain gauges. Likewise, it is conceivable<br>
that pressure sensors as, for example, piezo elements are<br>
used, which pick up the thrust forces arising at the<br>
junction or contact points.<br>

invention are described in detail below on the basis of<br>

Fig. 9 shows a sectional view through a thread reversing<br>
mechanism according to the invention to measure the tension<br>
in an upper thread.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a sectional view of a stitching machine.<br>
The stitching head 1 comprises a needle drive mechanism for<br>
several stitching needles 2, which can selectively stitch an<br>
upper thread 3 with their tips 2a. Fig. 1 only shows the<br>
component parts relevant to the function of the device. The<br>
upper th.ead 3 is guided via reversing devices 5a, 5b, 5c,<br>
5d and 5e to the stitching needle 2. The stitching thread 3<br>
is wound off from the feed spool 4 over the reversing<br>
mechanism 5a, 5b and 5c and guided through the respective<br>
eyes 5a, 5b and 5c to the respective drive rollers 6.<br>
The stitching thread in this case loops once or several<br>
times the drive roller 6 assigned to it and then leaves the<br>
roller 6 in the direction of the thread guide mechanism 5d,<br>
through the eye of which it is further taken in the<br>
direction of the thread tension sensor 8, in order then to<br>
pass through the thread guide 5e or its eye 5e in the<br>
direction of the needle tip. Thread feed or thread<br>
withdrawal is ensured by means of drive 10 and drive roller<br>
11. The drive 10 can rotate the roller 11 in both directions<br>
of rotation around pre-set angles, so that pre-determined<br>
thread lengths are supplied (thread feed) or pulled back in<br>
the direction of the spool (thread withdrawal). For thread<br>
withdrawal, thread bobbins not illustrated or a winding<br>
mechanism for the feed spool 4 are provided. The drive 10<br>
including drive roller 11 is rotatably mounted so that it<br>
can be optionally swiveled against one of the rollers 6. For<br>
this purpose, the stitching head 1 can also be moved<br>
parallel to the axis of the rollers 6. If another upper<br>
thread has to be stitched, the drive mechanism 10, 11 is<br>
swiveled away from the roller 6 last driven in each case and<br>
then the stitching head 1 is moved parallel to the axis of<br>
the rollers 6, until the drive roller 11 is in the vicinity<br><br>
of the driven roller 6 of the stitching or sewing thread<br>
next to be stitched, in order thereafter to be pressed<br>
lightly or swiveled against the roller 6. The respective<br>
thread is wound off from the feed spool 4 and advanced by<br>
frictional force for loop formation or withdrawn by means of<br>
the other direction of rotation in order to complete the<br>
loop formation or stitching process.<br>
During the current stitching operation, the thread tension<br>
of the upper thread being stitched in each case is<br>
determined, in order to control thread withdrawal depending<br>
on the determined tension.<br>
The device according to Fig. 2 is expanded by additional<br>
thread take-up levers, whereby the thread tension can be<br>
additionally controlled or regulated during thread<br>
withdrawal by adjusting the respective thread cake-up lever<br>
12. Functionally similar component parts compared to tne<br>
device according to Fig.l are described with the same<br>
reference numbers. Due to the additional use of the thread<br>
take-up levers 12, a thread reversing mechanism 13, 14 is<br>
needed, through the eyes 14 of which the upper threads are<br>
fed. Through the additional guidance of the upper threads by<br>
the thread take-up levers 12, the thread length between<br>
needle tip and drive roller 6 can be regulated additionally<br>
by vertical adjustment of the thread take-up levers 12, so<br>
that possibly the drive mechanism 10 only needs to be able<br>
to rotate in one direction It is, however, also conceivable<br>
that if the drive roller 11 is rotated in both directions<br>
for thread feed and thread withdrawal, the thread tension in<br>
the upper thread being stitched in each case is also<br>
regulated by means of the vertical positioning of the thread<br>
take-up lever 12.<br><br>
With both devices according to Figs. 1 and 2, the upper<br>
thread 3 is fed past a sensor 8 whereby through excursion of<br>
the upper thread 3 by means of sensor S the sensor 8 itself<br>
is subjected to pressure from the upper thread 3. The thread<br>
tension in the upper thread 3 can be determined from this<br>
pressure by simple conversion.'<br>
Fig. 3 shows a detailed view of the drive mechanism 10 with<br>
driven roller 11, which is lightly pressed against roller 6.<br>
The roller 6 is looped once or several times by an upper<br>
thread 3, so that the upper thread cannot slip through on<br>
the roller 3. Possibly, the surface of roller 6 is<br>
rubberized, so increased friction is produced between upper<br>
thread 3 and roller 6. The mounting plate for the axle of<br>
the roller 6 is fixed on the stitching head 1 by .r.eans of<br>
the fastening part 15. A guide rail 15, which comprises<br>
several window-like openings 5c ' in the form of eyes, is<br>
positioned as it were on the mounting device 15.<br>
Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show typical tension gradients during a<br>
stitch or loop formation. Fig. 4 in this case shows a<br>
tension gradient, in which both the lower thread ana the<br>
upper thread have a function. The first tension peak in the<br>
angle range of approx. 50° is caused by threading the lower<br>
thread through the loop formed by the upper thread. If the<br>
lower thread has broken, the strength exerted by the lower<br>
thread on the upper thread is reduced, and the first tension<br>
peak, as shown in Fig. 5, turns out to be considerably<br>
smaller. On the other hand, if the upper thread has broken,<br>
then only very slight thread tension is detected by the<br>
sensors (Fig. 6).<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows a device to measure the thread tension in the<br>
case of a multi-thread stitching or sewing head. The upper<br>
threads 3 are fed via a thread reversing mechanism 16, 17,<br>
whereby the upper thread 3 just stitched exerts forces on<br>
the U-shaped part 16 duer to looping of the parts 16, 17,<br>
whereby the U-shaped part 16 again exerts forces on the<br>
mounting device 19. As shown in Fig. 8, each mounting device<br>
19 consists of two angular brackets 20, 23, which are joined<br>
to one another by means of a screw 22 in each case. Both<br>
free ends of the U-shaped part 16 are attached by means of<br>
such a mounting device 19 to the front la of the stitching<br>
head 1. The ends of the U-shaped part 16 are attached by<br>
means of connecting screws 24 to the one leg of the angular<br>
bracket 23. The other leg of the angular bracket 23 is<br>
connected by means of the connecting screw 22 with the first<br>
leg of the lower angular bracket 20. This leg comprises a<br>
thin-walled area 20a, which is bent by the tension in the<br>
upper thread. The deformation of the angular area 20a is<br>
recorded by means of a sensor S shown in Fig. 9, whereby<br>
conclusions about the thread tension in the upper thread<br>
just stitched are possible. The other leg of the lower<br>
angular bracket 20 is attached to the stitching head 1 by<br>
means of a screw 21. The upper reversing bar 17 is<br>
positioned by means of fastening parts 18 and screws 18a<br>
above the reversing mechanism 16. The reversing mechanism or<br>
the U-shaped part 16 comprises eyes 16, through which an<br>
upper thread is guided in each case.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a sectional view through the reversing<br>
mechanism according to Figs. 7 and 8. In the thin-walled<br>
area 20a, a wire strain gauge as sensor S is bonded onto the<br>
lower surface of the angular bracket 20, which records<br>
excursions or deformation of the leg of the lower angular<br>
bracket 20. The wire strain gauge or sensor S, in order to<br>
prevent damage or contamination, is sealed with as flexible<br>
a material as possible. Advantageously, the supply lines 25<br>
to the sensor S are arranged in such a way that despite<br>
deformation of the angular bracket 20 are onxy exposed to<br>
minor mechanical stress, so that they are not subject to<br>
increased wear and tear.<br>
The dimensions of the mounting device 19, 20, .23 for<br>
attaching the U-shaped part 16 to the stitching head 1<br>
should be such that the small forces F arising, which due to<br>
the thread tension of the upper threads bear on the U-shaped<br>
part lead to sufficiently large deformation of the leg with<br>
the thin-walled area 20a of the angular bracket 20. For this<br>
reason, leverage ratios are to be configured accordingly. It<br>
should be ensured that due to mechanical stress and natural<br>
vibration of the stitching head the intrinsic movements of<br>
the stitching hesd do net lead to vibration of the angular-<br>
bracket 20 and thus to false readings.<br><br>
