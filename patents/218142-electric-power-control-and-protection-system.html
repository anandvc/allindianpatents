				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electric power  protection and control system in combination of digital protection controllers, such as digital relays, to protect and control an electric power system by inputting status quantities of the electric power system and converting them into digital data and a display controller to display and control the monitoring of operation and status of the digital protection controllers via a communication network, and a distributed control system.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Digital protection controllers, such as digital relays, are already used widely in the field of the electric power system, and are made highly functional by use of highly efficient microprocessors and memories of large capacity, etc. in recent years.  In particular, for the power saving of<br><br>
their operation and maintenance, it becomes possible to realize a remote operation and monitoring system for operating and monitoring the operation and status of digital protection controllers via a wide area transmission network from a long distance.<br>
In these systems, it is possible to display electrical quantities (current and voltage quantities converted into digital data) input from an electric power system at a distant place via a transmission system in addition to the detailed information relative to the operation and status of digital protection controllers.  Definite examples of these systems are disclosed in literatures, for instance, (The 1996 National Meeting of The'Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan, Lectured Theses 1529 "Development of Digital Relay Remote Operation Monitoring System").<br>
On a system for the purpose of the remote operation of conventional digital protection controllers, such as digital relays, it takes such a form that along the remote operation menu of digital protection controllers (hereinafter referred to as "Protection Controllers"), a request is submitted from a remote personal computer via a wide area transmission network. When this request is received, the protection controller performs the process according to the request and returns a response to the personal computer that: sent the request. An example of the remote operation menu is shown in FIGURE 18.<br><br>
A case in taken to change the setting, for example, the setting of a threshold value of the relay operation in a digital relay, according to a setting menu as an example. As shown in FIGURE 19, the steps will be as shown below: First, selecting a display control menu after selecting a substation and equipment and connecting the communication according to a communication menu within a remote operation menu; and then, after further selecting the setting, setting elements to be changed are selected, numerical values to be changed are input and a writing request is submitted to EEPROMs in the protection controller, and thereafter, an operation starting request is submitted.<br>
In this case, until a series of processings is completed, it is necessary to maintain the connection between the personal computer and the protection controllers. Accordingly, there will be a first problem that delay of communication accompanied with increase in the traffic on a communication network and drop of reliability generated from loss of communication packets.<br>
FIGURE 19 shows the change of one setting element. But so as to change plural setting elements, a required time further increases. Further, to have a personal computer generate various requests corresponding to the above-described remote operation menu, it is required for the operator to operate the personal computer to each request. This means that when functions of a protection<br><br>
controller become complicated and versatiled, the number of operations increase and workload of the operator increases. Further, when plural protection controllers are required to execute the same operation, it becomes complicated as the same work is performed for different controllers, and there will be caused such a second problem that with the increase of workload, the drop of reliability due to human error will be generated.<br>
Further, in case of such a remote operation system, plural protection controllers are operated by a single personal computer. In this case, it will become necessary to configure the system by taking differences in the substances of protection controllers (for instance, setting elements due to different protection relaying scheme) into consideration.<br>
The configuration in this case is shown in FIGURE 20. As shown in this FIGURE 20, the configuration at the personal computer side is corresponding to the kinds of protection controllers. This means that with the increase in kinds of protection controllers, the volume of the corresponding software that is to be provided on a personal computer increases, and there will be such a third problem that the necessity for modification is produced and the economy and reliability of the system will become worse.<br>
Further, in such a remote operation system, as a local network and a wide area transmission network are used, the protection controllers can be easily operated remotely at a<br><br>
place where they can be connected to these communication networks.  In other words, the remote operation can be made similarly through personal computers installed at plural locations.<br>
This state is shown in FIGURE 21.  In this case, it is necessary to provide a remote operation software that is corresponding to each protection controller to each personal computer as described above, and there will be a fourth problem that this system is inferior in the aspect of economy such as required expenses and maintenance.<br>
Further, as it becomes possible to monitor the operation of plural protection controllers by a single personal computer in the remote operation system as described above, it is possible to compare related same items (for instance, electrical quantities of the system taken by plural protection controllers connected to the same system).<br>
In this case, a personal computer is connected to protection controllers subject for communication and displays operating items along the remote operation menu shown in FIGURE 18.  If it is desired to check the state of the same items on other related controllers, a personal computer is connected similarly to the related controllers for communication and displays the items along the operation menu shown in FIGURE 18.<br>
In this case, if the number of protection controllers subject for control is increased, such operations as<br><br>
selection of controllers, connection for communication and selection of items become necessary for each protection controller and the operations becomes very complicated, and related other protection controllers and items are displayed independently for each protection controller. However, as they are not displayed as related protection controllers and items in the same picture, there will be such a fifth problem that the comparison of related items will become an overload for operator.<br>
In this case, it is considered to consolidate the menu for every same related items over plural controllers. But if it is required to see different items for each controller, it will be complicated conversely, and in addition, the maintainability will become a problem when there is an increase/modification of the controller.  Further, there will be such a sixth problem that if the same protection controller is accessed simultaneously by plural display controllers, the processing load of the protection controller increases in order to respond to the access and therefore, a response is delayed.<br>
Further, for such a remote operation system there is the possibility for demand to realize versatile functions. For instance, conventionally the protection, control and measurement of an electric power system are separated as separate controller.  It is considered to consolidate these functions in the same controller.  In this case, there will<br><br>
be a seventh problem that the processes to be incorporated in a protection controller increase and an excessive load is generated in the aspect of the economical efficiency, reliability and maintainability.<br>
Further, when changing the specification of a protection controller, it is a general practice to stop the controller and change a ROM containing a program, and there will be an eighth problem that the drop of availability of the system and complicated changed workload.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, the embodiments of this<br><br>
invention will be described below.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a diagram showing the construction of an electric power system protection and control system according to a first embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 1, 10 is a digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of an electric power system 1 by inputting a status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is a subject to the protection and control and outputting a protection and control output Cl to electric power system 1, and it is composed of a program module receiving means 11, an execution means 12 and an execution result and program module returning/transferring means 13.<br>
Further, a display controller 20 remotely controls plural protection controllers including digital protection controller 10 and an another digital protection controller 40 in the same construction via a communication network 30, and it has a program module sending means 21.<br>
As the operations of this embodiment, a program module corresponding to the contents of the display on display controller 20 is first sent out by program module sending means 21 in display controller 20 via communication network 30. For instance, program modules corresponding to items of the remote operation menu shown in FIGURE 18 are sent out as shown in FIGURE 2.<br>
Here, a program module is composed of a combination of data and the description of steps to process them.  For<br><br>
instance, in case of the setting menu described above, data are setting values corresponding to protection controllers and procedural steps can be said to be those procedural steps until these setting values are stored in a specified memory in protection controller.<br>
The program module sent out is received by program module receiving means 11 in digital protection controller 10 via communication network 30 and executed by execution means 12. The flow of the sending, receiving and execution processes of the program module in this case are summarized as shown in FIGURE 3.<br>
The setting program module sent from the display controller is composed of set value data to be set and procedural steps (for instance, in which memory the setting values are to be stored, to which process resident in the protection controller is to be requested). As a result, the detailed process relative to the setting process is executed in the protection controller. That is, the processes are executed for such hardware resources as RAM, EEPROM (new), EEPROM (former) in the protection controller.<br>
These processes are carried out so far between the display controller and the protection controllers as shown in FIGURE 19.  In this embodiment, as the setting program module incorporating these processes is moved to the protection controller side and executed therein, the traffic on the communication network is reduced when compared with the prior<br><br>
art.  Further the operator is required only to give new setting values to the display controller. Accordingly, such the operation as before to send requests to the protection controllers will not be required for operator.<br>
After the program module is executed by execution means 12, this execution result or the program module is processed by execution result and program module returning/transferring means (hereinafter referred to as returning/transferring means) 13.  For instance, in case of the setting program module described above, whether the set result is satisfactory or the set value is not within the specified range and not proper is returned to display controller 20 via communication network 30.<br>
Further, it is also considered that the setting job is carried out in the same contents for plural protection controllers.  In this case, the setting program module is transferred to other protection controller 40 using returning/transferring means 13.  In protection controller 40, same means 41, 42 and 43 as protection controller 10 are provided and the setting program module is received by a program module receiving means 41, executed by an execution means 42 in the same manner as described above, and the execution result is returned to display controller 20 or the setting program module is transferred to other protection controller by returning/transferring means 43, and processed similarly.<br><br>
A definite example of the present embodiment is shown in FIGURE 4.  Digital protection controller 10 is composed of an analog/digital conversion unit 10-1, a digital processing unit 10-2, an input/output interface 10-3 with external equipments such as a circuit breaker, etc., a communication interface 10-4 to interface communication network 30 and this protection controller 10 and a bus 10-5.  Further, all the units 10-1 through 10-4 are mutually connected through bus 10-5.<br>
Analog/digital conversion unit 10-1 is composed of an analog filter, a sampling hold circuit, a multiplexer, an analog-to-digital converter, etc. and taking the status quantities (for instance, current, voltage) of an electric power system that is subject to the protection and control as an analog information and after holding at. a specified sampling interval, they are converted into digital quantities.<br>
On the other hand, digital processing unit 10-2 is composed of a CPU 2-1, RAM 2-2, ROM 2-3 and non-volatile memory EEPROM 2-4. The digital converted quantities of electrical quantity data are transferred to RAM 2-2 sequentially. By these data, set values of protective relays stored in EEPROM 2-4 and programs from RAM 2-2 and ROM 2-3, CPU 2-1 performs various protection and control operations. Here, the present invention differs from a conventional protection controller in that a part of program is sent to RAM 2-2 through communication network 30 and processed as a<br><br>
program in digital processing unit 10-2.  The present invention features that the program modules is sent to RAM 2-2 via communication network 30 and transferred to a RAM of another protection controller while in the conventional protection controller, programs are fixedly written in ROM 2-3.  This digital processor 10-2 composes execution means 12, and a part of receiving means 11 and returning/transferring means 13.<br>
Next, input/output interface 10-3 is an interface to take the state of external control equipment such as information on a breaker and to output protection relay operation, return output, trip command, etc. to external equipment.  Further, communication interface 10-4 is one of the features of this invention and connects an ethernet LAN with protection controller 10, as shown in FIGURE 4.  Part of program module receiving means 11 and returning/transferring means 13 is realized by this communication interface 10-4.<br>
That is, the program module from communication network 30 is received here and transferred to RAM 2-2.  The program module executed in digital processing unit; 10-2 is sent to communication network 30 via this communication interface 10-4 and transferred to display controller 20 or another protection controller. A definite example of the construction of the electric power system protection and control system is as described above.<br>
Further, as an example of a communication network 30, it<br><br>
is composed of a network connecting protection controllers in a local range such as substation by an ethernet LAN, a network connecting personal computers and work stations in attended substation and a wide area network connecting both the networks in a wide area, as shown in FIGURE 4.<br>
The construction of an ethernet LAN is general and the explanation will be omitted here.  Further, as a wide area network, circuit switching networks such as telephone circuits are used. Display controller 20 described above is achieved by a personal computer shown in FIGURE 4.  Program module sending means 21 is achieved by a software in the personal computer and an interface circuit of an ethernet LAN.<br>
Next, the details of actions of the present embodiment will be described using the flowchart shown in FIGURE 5. First, the flowchart of the personal computer (display controller 20) side will be described. The remote operation menu described above is displayed on the display of the personal computer, and an operator selects an item in the remote operation menu in Step Sl-1.  For instance, when the setting job is selected, a setting program module is read out in Step Sl-2.<br>
In Step Sl-3, operator gives such data as a name of equipment of which setting is to be changed, a name of setting element to be changed, a set value, etc. to this setting program module.  In Step Sl-4, these data are stored in the setting program module and the setting program module<br><br>
is sent out to communication network 30. The details of program sending means 21 are as described above.<br>
Then, protection controller 10 receives the setting program module in Step S2-1 and stores in RAM 2-2.  This operation is equivalent to program module receiving means 11. In Step S2-2, this setting program module writes setting values in RAM, EEPROM (new) and EEPROM (former) in order while checking them as described above. This operation is equivalent to execution means 12.<br>
So far, data receiving and request between the setting process and EEPROM and RAM are made via communication network 30 each time, but are all completed in protection controller 10 in this invention.  Then, the execution result is judged in Step S2-3.  If it is defective (for instance, the writing into EEPROM and RAM is incomplete and specified values are not written), the setting is again needed and the defective result and the program module are returned to display controller 20 in Step S2-4.<br>
When the execution result is satisfactory and the setting to other controller is not needed in Step S2-5, the completion result and the program module are similarly returned to display controller 20 in Step S2-6.  Further, if the setting to other controller is needed, a name of other controller described in the setting program module is read in Step S2-7 and the setting program module is sent out with that equipment as a destination.  The operations from Steps<br><br>
S2-3 through S2-7 are equivalent to returning/transferring means 13.<br>
According to the above embodiment, as a program module itself corresponding to jobs that are performed by operator are sent to the protection controller from the display controller via the communication network for execution in the protection controller, it becomes possible to reduce the traffic on the communication network and improve the reliability. Further, as such works as operations corresponding to various requests and the same work required for plural controllers are no longer required as before, it becomes possible to reduce workload of the operator and provide a highly economical and reliable electric power system protection and control system.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a block diagram showing the construction of an electric power system protection and control system according to a second embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 6, 10 is digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of electric power system 1 by inputting status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is a subject of the protection and control, and is provided with a control symbol sending means 14. Further, display controller 20 remotely controls digital protection controller 10 via communication network 30 and is provided with control symbol interpreting means 22. This embodiment features the mechanism to control the layout structure of the<br><br>
display form when displaying or changing various data in protection controller 10 on the screen of display controller 20.<br>
A definite example is shown in FIGURE 7.  Shown in FIGURE 7 is an example when current values obtained from electric power system 1 are displayed and RMS values of two current values la, Ib are shown.  In this case, current values are measured value data that change with time. As shown in this figure, by combining what is described as a control symbol table and current value data, control symbol sending means sends the data formatted with a control symbol added to each data to display controller 20. Here, as item names, control symbols "Character" corresponding to the character data la, Ib are added.  Further, RMS values of la, Ib as changing numerical information are added with such control symbols as "Numerical Value", "Framed", "Effective Number of Digits 5", "Line Feed".<br>
In display controller 20, control symbol interpreting means 22 interprets how and in what form the received data should be arranged from the received data with control symbols and a control symbol table retained in itself and displays them on the screen. In this example, item names la, Ib have the control symbol "Character" as shown in FIGURE 7, and they are interpreted and displayed as character codes, respectively.  Further, numerical data are treated as numerical information and displayed in a frame and in not<br><br>
more than 5 digits of effective number.  Further, the line feed is made according to the line feed control symbol.  Thus, data of electrical quantities are displayed.<br>
As another example, on the setting value changing screen shown in FIGURE 8, two character data of 27, 64 are sent as the setting element names from the protection controller side. The control symbol "Character" is added to these character data similar to the example of electrical quantities as described above. Regarding setting values, such control symbols as "Numerical Value", "Framed", "Effective Number of Digits 4", "Numerical Value Designation", "Line Feed" are added to present setting value data (e.g., 90, 35).<br>
Thus, the display picture of the display controller after the interpretation becomes as shown, and a present setting value is displayed in not more than 4 digits for each setting element.  Further, the present setting values can be changed to new setting values by control symbols for designating numerical values. Thus, it becomes possible not only to display present data of the protection controller but also designate data rewriting place by adding control symbol. The definite construction of this embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment and becomes the system construction shown in FIGURE 4. Here, control symbol sending means 14 described above is realized by the program written in ROM 2-3, and the control symbol table is likewise stored in ROM 2-3.  Further, for data of electrical quantities, the<br><br>
instantaneous current value data transferred to RAM 2-2 from analog/digital conversion unit 10-1 in response to the request from display controller 20 are further processed for RMS value by CPU 21 and are used.<br>
The setting value data stored in EEPROM are used as described above.  Display controller 20 is realized by a personal computer and so on, and control symbol interpreting means 22 is also realized by a software of a personal computer.<br>
According to this embodiment, when plural protection controllers are remotely controlled by one personal computer via a communication network, it becomes not necessary to construct a display software at the personal computer side by taking various layouts with respect to the difference in contents of plural protection controllers, for instance, number of electrical quantities of the system, number of setting elements, number of digits, frame display, etc. into consideration.<br>
This is because control symbols for layout are added to data to be displayed or changed in the protection controller side, and the display can be made only by providing a software for interpreting the control symbols in the personal computer side. Therefore, there is such a merit that the software size at the personal computer side does not: become large and the electric power system protection and control system is excellent in the economical efficiency.<br><br>
Further, when the contents of the protection controller are changed due to the change in manufacturing specifications, conventionally it is needed to change a software of a personal computer correspondingly. But, according to this embodiment, it is sufficient to modify the protection controller side only and thus, the reliability is improved. Further, even when many personal computers are used, number of software to be provided is only one kind. As a result, there is such a merit that the maintenance resulting from increase in kinds of protection controllers is easy and the system is excellent in economical efficiency.  Further, though one example of control symbols is shown in FIGURE 7 and FIGURE 8, this invention is applicable to all control symbols determining the layout structure of display, and the effect is the same.<br>
FIGURE 9 is a block diagram showing the construction of an electric power system protection and control system according to a third embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 9, 10 is a digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of electric power system 1 by inputting status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is an object of protection and control, and is further provided with, in addition to the system shown in FIGURE 6, other controller display control symbol sending means 15 and a data retrieval/sending means 16.  Further, display controller 20 remotely operates plural controllers such as<br><br>
digital protection controllers 10 and controller 40 in the same construction via communication network 30 and is further provided with, in addition to the system shown in FIGURE 6, other controller display control symbol interpreting means 23,<br>
The operation of this display controller 20 will be described using FIGURE 10.  FIGURE 10 shows the operation of display controller 20 in the form that is able to compare the magnitudes of electrical quantities of the system taken by both protection controllers 10 and 40 in the structure described above in terms of sizes of currents when two protection controllers 10, 40 are remotely controlled on one display controller 20.<br>
First, a request for sending electrical quantity data is output to digital protection controller 10 from a personal computer (display controller 20) .  In response to the request, digital protection controller 10 sends out electrical quantity data (current RMS values) la, Ib and Ic in the own controller.  Further, jointly with this data, "Other Controller Name: Controller 40", "Data Identification: Current RMS Values" are sent out as control symbols by other controller display control symbol sending means 15 in protection controller 10.<br>
Display controller 20 interprets these control symbols by other controller display control symbol interpreting means 23 and requests current RMS values to protection controller 40. Receiving this request, protection controller 40<br>
retrieves current RMS values la, Ib and Ic by data retrieving/sending means 46 and sends them to display controller 20.  The display screen will become as shown in this figure.<br>
The flow of operation of display controller 20 at this time is shown in FIGURE 11.  In FIGURE 11, data sent from digital protection controller 10 are first interpreted in order in Step S3-1 and electrical quantity data relative to digital protection controller 10 are displayed in Step S3-2. In Step S3-3, the other controller display control symbols contained in the received data are interpreted and a request signal is sent out to digital protection controller 40 that is designated from the name of the controller.  In Step S3-4, display controller 20 waits until data are sent from protection controller 40 and displays data at the received timing in Step S3-5.<br>
According to this embodiment, when data from two different controllers are viewed from the operator, it becomes possible to display them as if they are data in the same controller. Conventionally, to acquire data from different controllers, the operator has to rework from the connection for communication and the operation is complicated, In this embodiment, as the display controller automatically<br>
I<br>
interprets control symbols and sends a request to other controllers, the operation becomes easy and this electric power system protection and control system is excellent in<br><br>
the reliability and operability.<br>
Further, as this system is in such structure that control symbols are provided at the protection controller side, the same effect as the second embodiment can be expected.  Further, as control symbols discriminating the name of other controller and type of data are added to display data of protection controller that is a subject of protection and control, the operator is able to display data of plural controllers and operate them in a combined form. This will become a very efficient means when collecting data, comparing and analyzing data of an electric power system protection and control system installed in a wide range.<br>
The definite construction of this embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment, that is, it becomes the system construction shown in FIGURE 4. Here, other controller display control symbol sending means 15 is realized by a program written in ROM 2-3, and also, the control symbol table is similarly stored in ROM 2-3.  Further, the electrical quantity data transferred from analog/digital conversion unit 10-1 to RAM 2-2 in response to the request from display unit 20 is used.<br>
Display controller 20 is realized by a personal computer, etc. and other controller display control symbol interpreting means 23 is also realized by a software of the personal computer.  Further, current RMS values are designated as type of data for control symbols in the above embodiment, but even<br><br>
when type of data is not specifically designated, the effect is the same if the name of other controller is designated as a control symbol.<br>
In other words, while checking data of selected controller on the screen, the connection with other controller can be automatically made and thus, an operating work volume can be reduced more than before.  Further, in the above flowchart, data of other controller is automatically acquired in Step S3-3, even if they are acquired after so instructed by operator, the same effect is obtained.<br>
FIGURE 12 is a block diagram showing the construction of an electric power system protection and control system according to a fourth embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 12, 10 is digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of electric power system 1 by inputting status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is an object of the protection and control, and is composed of a program module sending means 17.  Further, display controller 20 remotely operates digital protection controller 10 via communication network 30 and is composed of a program module receiving means 24 and a program module execution means 25.<br>
As its operations, contents to be displayed on display controller 20 (menu items, etc.) are first sent to protection controller 10, and the program module corresponding to the item sent to protection controller 10 is selected and is sent<br><br>
to display controller 20 using program module sending means 17. Display controller 20 receives this program module by program module receiving means 24 and program module execution means 25 executes it and displays the execution result.<br>
When displaying plural electrical quantities, for instance, RMS value and phases of three phases of voltage and three phases of current, an electrical quantity displaying program module is selected by program module sending means 17 as a program module corresponding to a selected item of the remote operating menu. As regard selecting which module in connection with which item, the protection controller has a corresponding table.<br>
This electrical quantity display program module computes and displays RMS values and phases of three phases of voltage and three phases of current, and it computes RMS values and phases from instantaneous values of current and voltage obtained from analog/digital conversion unit 10-1 shown in FIGURE 4.<br>
This invention features that this program module is moved to display controller 20 and executed at display controller 20 side. Thus, when instantaneous data of current and voltage are sent to the display controller 20, the program module operates RMS values and phases using these data and displays them as shown in FIGURE 13.<br>
The definite construction of this embodiment is similar<br><br>
to that of the first embodiment and becomes the system construction shown in FIGURE 4.  Here, program module sending means 17 is realized by the program written in ROM 2-3 and a program module that becomes an object of selection is also stored in ROM 2-3.  Further, display controller 20 is realized by a personal computer, etc., program module receiving means 24 and program module execution means 25 are also realized by a software of a personal computer.<br>
Further, the operating method of RMS values and phases of electrical quantity may differs depending on the contents of the protection controller.  For instance, in analog/digital conversion unit 10-1, its hardware has different sampling intervals: that is, electrical angles 30° , 15° , 7.5°  and 3.75°  are present.  Therefore, the operation to obtain RMS values and phases using instantaneous value data sampled at these sampling intervals becomes different as a matter of course. The technique to calculate RMS values and phases from AC instantaneous value data is described in a publication titled "Digital Relay Practice Reader", edited by Izumi Mitani, published from OHM Corp., etc.)<br>
Therefore, when such different analog/digital conversion units are present in plural controllers that are objects for the remote control, it will be questionable in the economical<br>
/<br>
efficiency to provide all corresponding electrical quantity data display modules to the display controller as the display controller becomes large in scale. But according to this<br><br>
embodiment, relative program modules are transferred from the protection controllers and are executed only when needed, and therefore, this electric power system protection and control system according to this embodiment is excellent in the economical efficiency.<br>
In this embodiment, the display of electrical quantity is described.  This embodiment has the same effect in the same construction in other processes depending on the system configuration and the protection and control system, for instance, the display of substances of system operation etc. Further, by executing program modules in the display controller, load on the CPU of the protection controller can be reduced than when they are executed in the protection controller.<br>
In particular, when requests are sent to the same protection controller from plural display controllers connected to the communication network, if program modules are executed on the protection controller, the process is retarded and sufficient responses may not be obtained. However, in this embodiment, required program modules are moved to respective personal computers (display controllers) for execution, and therefore, it becomes possible to construct an electric power system protection and control system without making the scale of the protection controllers large.<br>
FIGURE 14 is a block diagram showing the construction of<br><br>
an electric power system protection and control system according to a fifth embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 14, 10 is digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of electric power system 1 by inputting status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is an object of protection and control, and is composed of a program module receiving means 18 and an execution means 19.  Further, a program storage unit 50 is provided which feeds program modules to digital protection controller 10 via communication network 30 and has a program module sending means 51.<br>
As its operations, according to the program specification of an objective protection controller 10, a required program module is first selected by program module sending means 51 and sent to the protection controller 10 by the designation of operator of program storage unit 50. Protection controller 10 receives and executes this program module.<br>
The definite construction of this embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment and becomes the system construction shown in FIGURE 4. Here, program module sending means 18 is realized by the program written in ROM 2-3 and the received program modules is stored in RAM 2-2.  Further, program storage unit 50 is realized by a personal computer or a work station and program module sending means 51 is also realized by the software thereof.<br><br>
In recent years, the protection controllers are multi-functioned and may include such functions as measurement of the state of electric power system or the fault location, etc. in addition to the protection and control functions.  In these cases, all of the functions to be used are so far stored in advance in ROM 2-3 as programs and executed any time.  In this embodiment, a form is adopted to supply a required program module from program storage unit 50, when required.<br>
The supplied program module is stored in RAM 2-2 and CPU 2-1 reads out the program module from RAM 2-2 and executes it. For instance, if the measurement of the state of an electric power system is required, a measuring program module is supplied to and executed by protection controller 10. Further, when any fault is taken place, a fault location program module is supplied and executed.<br>
Further, when it becomes necessary to change or add program modules for specification change of functional improvement of the protection controllers,, it is necessary to exchange ROM itself, as program modules are stored in ROM 2-3. Therefore, it is so far required to stop the system and perform the ROM exchanging work. As a result, the availability of the system is dropped. But in this embodiment, the change or addition of program modules can be performed easily through the communication network.<br>
According to this embodiment, it becomes possible to add<br><br>
and change functions of the protection controllers easily and efficiently, and further, it is only required to make required functions only resident in the protection controllers. Therefore, it is not required to make the scale of the protection controllers large and it; is possible to provide an electric power system protection and control system excellent in economical efficiency, reliability and maintainability.<br>
FIGURE 15 is a block diagram showing the construction of an electric power system protection and control system according to a sixth embodiment of this invention.  In FIGURE 15, 10 is digital protection controller to perform the protection and control of electric power system I by inputting status quantity SI from electric power system 1 that is an object of protection and control. Digital protection controller 10 is composed of three areas: an area 1 wherein control symbol sending means 14, other controller display control symbol sending means 15, data retrieving/sending means 16 and program module sending means 17 are arranged: an area 2 wherein program module receiving means 11, execution means 12, execution result and program module returning/transferring means 13, program module receiving means 18 and execution means 19 are arranged; and an area 3 to perform the protection and control operation without being directly connected to communication network 30. Here, area 3 composes a core area of protection controller 10,<br><br>
and areas 1 and 2 compose a web area thereof.<br>
Further, display controller 20 performs the remote control of plural controllers including digital protection controllers 10 and 40 in the same construction.  Display controller 20 is composed of, though not shown in FIGURE 15, program module sending means 21, control symbol interpreting means 22, other controller display control symbol interpreting means 23, program module receiving means 24 and program module executing means 25 corresponding to the plural means of protection controller 10.  Further, program storage unit 50 is connected to communication network 30 and has program module sending means 51.<br>
The present embodiment features that as a method of composing the protection controller by combining the first through fifth embodiments, protection controller 10 is divided into three areas described above.  In other words, in area 1, information is provided passively to the display controller and the process is not changed in the protection controller.  On the other hand, in area 2, information is exchanged positively to/from the display controller, other protection controller and program storage unit and the change and addition of the process in the protection controller are positively performed.  Further, area 3 is not directly connected to the communication network and is free from the influence of the communication network.<br>
In case of conventional protection controllers, close<br><br>
connection with other controllers via the communication network is less.  On the contrary, the protection controller in this invention is closely connected to other controllers as shown in the first through fifth embodiments.  Further, when the protection control operation of an electric power system is compared with the data display process in the protection controller, there is a tendency that the realtime processing is demanded for the former more than the latter. Further, area 2 has a larger memory capacity than other areas, as program modules are often stored in or kept stayed on RAM. It is therefore required to construct the system corresponding to the natures of respective means.  This is why three areas are provided that are proposed by this embodiment.<br>
A definite example of the construction of this embodiment is shown in FIGURE 16.  In FIGURE 16, analog/digital conversion unit 10-1, input/output interface 10-3 and communication interface 10-4 are the same as those shown in FIGURE 4. This embodiment features that digital processing unit 10-2 is divided into 3 portions.  Digital processing units 2-A, 2-B and 2-C are shared to take care the processes of areas 1, 2 and 3, respectively.<br>
As areas 1 and 2 exchange data with communication interface 10-4, digital processing units 2-A and 2-B are in the form capable of being connected to communication network 10-4 in the aspect of both hardware and software.  Further,<br><br>
the hardware and software of digital processing unit 2-C are so constructed that it is not connected with communication interface 10-4.  Definitely, the connection of each of the processing units with the communication network can be controlled by the contents of programs stored in ROM in each processing unit and the restriction at the interface between each processing unit and the system bus.<br>
As a result of the separation of the hardware into three areas, a program module erroneously coming through the communication network no longer affects the protection control processing unit of area 3 and safety is secured. Further, as all CPUs are separated, a high-speed CPU is used for area 3 where the realtime process is required and low-speed CPUs can be used for the processing units in area 1 and 2, achieving an economical construction.  Further, it becomes possible to use a large capacity RAM for area 2 and store program modules.<br>
In FIGURE 15, the necessary relation and function between area 2 and area 3 at the minimum is to be able to send and receive the execution result without interfering the operation in the other area.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the embodiments described above, it is possible that area 3 is provided with the function to respond to the object of the protection and control (such as the electric power system, in case of<br><br>
protective relay, and the receiving the money and outputting the vending product in case of vending machine) in real time (within an assured time limit).  It is possible that area 2 is provided with the function to execute the program module received from the network surely and safely (concretely, it is judged whether the received program module can be executed or not, and whether it is executed in safe or not) . Here, it is not required to execute the program module in area 2 in a real time.<br>
According to this embodiment, it is possible to provide an electric power system protection and control system excellent in reliability and economical efficiency as the safety against the protection control function is secured in spite of the system in which controllers are closely connected to other controllers via the communication network and optimum hardware resources can be allotted to respective means.<br>
Here, it is possible to execute the protection operation in not only in area 3 but also in execution means 12 in area 2.  In this case, area 3 takes charge of a main protection function. The function is enough to be fixed in spite of the change in the system, without providing with the flexibility. The protection function is executed in high speed to make the fault spread minimum in any case.<br>
Execution means 12 in area 2 mainly takes charge of a back-up protection function for the purpose of the back-up of area 3.  It receives information, such as voltages, currents, breaker state, and generator state, etc. connected to the network.  For example, it operates such a signal as to make the effect of the fault in the power plant to the minimum, and sends the signal through the network.  In execution means 12, it is good that the processing speed of the protection operation is low. Basically, as the function is for back-up use, it is enough that one program module for back-up protection use is periodically transferred through the network. Accordingly, it is not necessary to store the program module in execution means 12 in area 2 at all times.<br>
Furthermore, execution means 12 in FIGURES 1 and 15 executes the program module sent through communication network 30.  In addition, it can send the information, such as status quantity Si from electric power system 1, to the program module.  For example, this information is stored in RAM 2-2 in digital processing unit 10-2, and when the program module is received in execution means 12, execution means 12 sends the information of electric power system 1 to the program module.<br>
Further, it is possible that protection and control output Cl operated in digital processing unit 10-2 is stored temporarily in RAM 2-2, and then sent to the program module.<br>
In FIGURES 1 and 15, as for the program module executed<br><br>
in protection controllers 10, 40, the program module is assumed, such as protective relay operation, control operation, monitoring processing, diagnosis processing, display processing, and analysis processing, etc.<br>
A different construction example of this embodiment is shown in FIGURE 17.  In FIGURE 17, a bus 10-6 is newly added to the construction shown in FIGURE 16, and digital processing unit 2-C is completely separated from communication interface 10-4. Digital processing units 2-A and 2-B are connected to both of communication interface 10-4 and digital processing unit 2-C.  The effect obtained from this construction is equivalent to that of the construction described above and the explanation is omitted.<br>
Further, this invention is not limited, to an electric power system only. But this invention is also applicable to a distributed control system composed of plural distributed controllers to control equipments to be controlled by taking status quantities therefrom and a display controller connected to these distributed controllers via a communication network to display and control for monitoring the operations and status of distributed controllers (or a program storage unit to store program modules that are capable of operating on the distributed controllers).  In this case, in the embodiments described above, the protection<br><br>
controllers should be read as the distributed controllers. In essence, this invention can be applied to a system composed of a plurality of units, each for operating an equipment which is the object to be operated by inputting a status quantity of the equipment, and a display controller connected to each of the units via a communication network for displaying and controlling an operation and status of each of the units for monitoring (or a program storage unit for storing a program module which can be operated in the units).<br>
As described above, according to this invention, it is possible to provide an electric power system protection and control system and a distributed control system which are excellent in the operability, economical efficiency, maintainability and reliability without in creasing the traffic of the communication network, by utilizing the fact that the controllers are connected to the communication network and paying attention to the movement of a program module and the cooperating functions among various controllers in the system.<br>
Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.  It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced<br><br>
