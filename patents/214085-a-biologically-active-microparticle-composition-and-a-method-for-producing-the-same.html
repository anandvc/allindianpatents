				<td>Statement of Related Application<br>
[0001] This application is related to Patent Application Serial No. 60/236,077,<br>
filed September 28,2000. This application is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety.<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to microparticles with adsorbent surfaces,<br>
methods for preparing such microparticles, and uses thereof. Additionally, the<br>
invention relates to compositions comprising biodegradable microparticles wherein<br>
biologically active agents, such as therapeutic polynucleotides, poh/peptides,<br>
antigens, and adjuvants, are adsorbed on the surface of the microparticles.<br>
Background<br>
[0003] Particulate carriers have been used in order to achieve controlled,<br>
parenteral delivery of therapeutic compounds. Such carriers are designed to<br>
maintain the active agent in the delivery system for an extended period of time.<br>
Examples of particulate carriers include those derived from polymethyl<br>
methacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived from poly(lactides) (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919), poly(lactide-co-glycolides), known as PLG (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,767,628) and polyethylene glycol, known as PEG (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,648,095). Polymethyl methacrylate polymers are nondegradable<br>
while PLG particles biodegrade by random nonenzymatic hydrolysis of ester bonds<br>
to lactic and gh/colic acids, which are excreted along normal metabolic pathways.<br>
[0004] For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,648,095 describes the use of<br>
microspheres with encapsulated Pharmaceuticals as drug delivery systems for nasal,<br>
oral, pulmonary and oral delivery. Slow-release formulations containing various<br>
polypeptide growth factors have also been described. See, e.g., International<br>
Publication No. WO 94/12158, U.S. Patent No. 5,134,122 and International<br>
Publication No. WO 96/37216.<br>
[0005] Fattal et al., Journal of Controlled Release 53:137-143 (1998) describes<br>
nanoparticles prepared from polyalkylcyanoacrylates (PACA) having adsorbed<br>
oligonucleotides.<br>
[0006] Paniculate carriers have also been used with adsorbed or entrapped<br>
antigens in attempts to elicit adequate immune responses. Such carriers present<br>
multiple copies of a selected antigen to the immune system and promote trapping<br>
and retention of antigens in local lymph nodes. The particles can be phagocytosed<br>
by macrophages and can enhance antigen presentation through cytokine release.<br>
For example, commonly owned, co-pending Application No. 09/015,652, filed<br>
January 29, 1998, describes the use of antigen-adsorbed and antigen-encapsulated<br>
microparticles to stimulate cell-mediated immunological responses, as well as<br>
methods of making the microparticles.<br>
[0007] In commonly owned co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/015,652 filed January 29, 1998, for example, a method of forming<br>
microparticles is disclosed which comprises combining a polymer with an organic<br>
solvent, then adding an emulsion stabilizer, such as the surfactant polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(PVA), then evaporating the organic solvent, thereby forming microparticles. The<br>
surface of the microparticles comprises the polymer and the stabilizer.<br>
Macromolecules such as DNA, polypeptides, and antigens may then be adsorbed on<br>
those surfaces.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patents 5,814,482 and 6,015,686 disclose Eukaryotic Layered<br>
Vector Initiation Systems (ELVIS vectors), particularly those derived and<br>
constructed from alphavirus genomes (such as Sindbis virus), for use in stimulating<br>
an immune response to an antigen, in methods of inhibiting pathogenic agents, and<br>
in delivery of heterologous nucleotide sequences to eukaryotic cells and animals,<br>
among others.<br>
[0009] Commonly owned International patent application PCT/US99/17308<br>
and co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/715,902 disclose methods of<br>
making microparticles having adsorbed macromolecules, such as a pharmaceutical,<br>
a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, a protein, a hormone, an enzyme, a transcription or<br>
translation mediator, an intermediate in a metabolic pathway, an immunomodulator,<br>
an antigen, an adjuvant, or combinations thereof, and the like. Hie microparticles<br>
comprise, for example, a polymer such as a poly(alpha-hydroxy acid) (e.g., PLG), a<br>
polyhydroxy butyric acid, a polycaprolactone, a polyorthoester, a polyanhydride,<br>
and the like, and are formed using, for example, cationic, anionic or nonionic<br>
detergents.<br>
[0010] While antigen-adsorbed PLG microparticles offer significant<br>
advantages over other more toxic systems, adsorption of biologically active agents<br>
to the microparticle surface can nonetheless be improved. For example, it is often<br>
difficult or impossible to adsorb charged or bulky biologically active agents, such<br>
as polynucleotides, large poh/peptides, and the like, to the microparticle surface.<br>
Thus, there is a continued need for flexible delivery systems for such agents and,<br>
particularly for drugs that are highly sensitive and difficult to formulate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0011] The present inventors have found that adsorption of macromolecules to<br>
microparticles can be improved by ensuring that detergent is made available for<br>
forming a complex with the macromolecules at the time of adsorptioa This<br>
availability can be accomplished, for example, by separately providing a quantity of<br>
detergent at the time of macromolecule adsorption or by ensuring that the process<br>
for producing the microparticles results in a product containing a substantial<br>
amount of unbound detergent. This provision is to be contrasted with prior art<br>
techniques, where microparticles are thoroughly washed to remove residual<br>
detergent prior to macromolecule adsorption. For instance, in the Examples found<br>
in PCT/US99/17308 above, the microparticles are washed multiple times with<br>
water (i.e., they are washed with water four times by centrifugation) prior to<br>
exposure to the macromolecule of interest. Such washing steps remove essentially<br>
all unbound detergent, resulting in a final product in which greater than 99% of the<br>
remaining detergent is bound to the particles.<br>
[0012] Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, a microparticle<br>
composition is provided which comprises: (1) microparticles, which further<br>
comprise a polymer and a first detergent portion that is bound to the polymer; and<br>
(2) a complex of a biologically active macromolecule with a second detergent<br>
portion, which complex is adsorbed on the surface of the microparticles. The first<br>
detergent portion and the second detergent portion can comprise the same detergent<br>
or different detergents.<br>
[0013] Preferred biologically active macromolecules are selected from the<br>
group consisting of a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, a polynucleoside, an antigen, a<br>
pharmaceutical, a hormone, an enzyme, a transcription or translation mediator, an<br>
intermediate in a metabolic pathway, an immunomodulator, and an adjuvant.<br>
Preferred polymers are poh/(a-hydroxy acids), more preferably those selected from<br>
the group consisting of poly(L-lactide), poly(D.L-lactide) and poly(D,L-lactide-co-<br>
glycolide). More preferred are poly(D,L-lactide-co-gh/colide) polymers. Preferred<br>
poty(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymers are those having a lactide/glycolide molar<br>
ratio ranging from 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40, and having a<br>
molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 Daltons, more preferably from<br>
30,000 Daltons to 70,000 Daltons. More preferred biologically active<br>
macromolecules include bacterial and viral antigens (e.g., HIV antigens such as<br>
gpl20, gpl40, p24gag and p55gag, meningitis B antigens, streptococcus B<br>
antigens, and Influenza A hemagglutinin antigens) and porynucleotides that encode<br>
for antigens. The biologically active macromolecule can be, for example, in the<br>
form of a plasmid, an ELVIS vector, or an RNA vector construct. A particularly<br>
preferred biologically active macromolecuie is pCMV-p55gag.<br>
[0014] In some embodiments, the microparticle composition is provided with a<br>
further biologically active macromolecule, which may be bound or unbound, and<br>
may even be entrapped within the polymer. For example, the microparticle<br>
composition may be provided with an adjuvant, particularly a Thl stimulating<br>
adjuvant. Preferred adjuvants include CpG oligonucleotides, LTK.63, LTR72, MPL<br>
and aluminum salts, including aluminum phosphate.<br>
[0015] In some embodiments, the first detergent portion and the second<br>
detergent portion comprise the same detergent. Preferred detergents for this<br>
purpose are cationic detergents, for example, CTAB. In such embodiments, the<br>
first detergent portion (which is bound to the polymer) preferably comprises about<br>
5-95% of the total detergent in the composition, more preferably about 10-90%,<br>
even more preferably about 10-60%, and most preferably about 25-40%.<br>
[0016] In other embodiments, the first detergent portion and the second<br>
detergent portion comprise different detergents. For example, the first detergent<br>
portion can comprise a nonionic detergent (e.g., PVA) and the second detergent<br>
portion can comprise a cationic detergent (e.g., CTAB).<br>
[0017] According to another aspect of the presenting invention, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is added to the above microparticle<br>
compositions.<br>
[0018] Another aspect of the invention is directed to the delivery of a<br>
macromolecule to a vertebrate subject, which comprises administering to a<br>
vertebrate subject the microparticle composition above.<br>
(0019] In an additional aspect, the invention is directed to a method for<br>
eliciting a cellular and/or humoral immune response in a vertebrate subject, which<br>
comprises administering to a vertebrate subject a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a microparticle composition as described above.<br>
[0020] Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of<br>
immunization, which comprises administering to a vertebrate subject a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the microparticle composition above.<br>
[0021 ] In other aspects of the invention, the above microparticle compositions<br>
are used in the diagnosis of diseases, in the treatment of diseases, in vaccines,<br>
and/or in raising an immune response.<br>
[0022] Still other aspects of the invention are directed to methods of producing<br>
microparticle compositions. In general, these methods comprise: (a) forming an<br>
emulsion comprising (i) a polymer selected from the group consisting of a poly(a-<br>
hydroxy acid), a poh/hydroxy butyric acid, a polycaprolactone, a polyorthoester, a<br>
polyanhydride, and a polycyanoacrylate, (ii) an organic solvent, (iii) a detergent and<br>
(iv) water; followed by (b) removal of the organic solvent. About 10-90% of the<br>
total detergent in the resulting composition is preferably bound to microparticles in<br>
this embodiment, more preferably about 10-60%, and most preferably about 25-<br>
40%. In general, these microparticle compositions are subsequently incubated with<br>
a biologically active macromolecule, such as those discussed above, to produce a<br>
biologically active composition.<br>
[0023] Preferably the emulsion is a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion that is<br>
formed by a process comprising: (a) emulsifying an organic phase comprising the<br>
polymer and the organic solvent with a first aqueous phase comprising water to<br>
form a water-in-oil emulsion; and (b) emulsifying a second aqueous phase<br>
comprising the cationic detergent and water with the emulsion formed in step (a) to<br>
form a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
[0024] In some preferred embodiments, the detergent is a cationic detergent,<br>
which is provided in the emulsion at a weight to weight detergent to polymer ratio<br>
of from about 0.05:1 to about 0.5:1. In these embodiments, the method preferably<br>
further comprises cross-flow filtration of the particles after the solvent removal<br>
step. In a specific embodiment, the polymer is pory(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), the<br>
cationic detergent is CTAB, and the cationic detergent is provided in the emulsion<br>
at a weight to weight detergent to polymer ratio of from about 0.1:1 to about 0.5:1.<br>
[0025] In other preferred embodiments, the detergent is a cationic detergent<br>
that is provided in the emulsion at a weight to weight detergent to polymer ratio of<br>
from about 0.001:1 to about 0.05:1. At these lower levels, there is typically no need<br>
for a filtration or washing step to remove excess detergent. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the cationic detergent is CTAB, the polymer is pory(D,L-lactide-co-<br>
grycolide), the cationic detergent is provided in the emulsion at a weight to weight<br>
detergent to polymer ratio of from about 0.002:1 to about 0.04:1, and the<br>
micropartides are not subjected to a step to remove excess CTAB from the<br>
composition.<br>
[0026] Still other aspects of the invention are directed to methods of producing<br>
micropartide compositions, which methods comprise: (1) providing a<br>
micropartide in an emulsification process, which microparticle comprises a<br>
polymer and a first detergent portion that is bound to the microparticle; and (2)<br>
adsorbing a complex of a biologically active macromolecule and a second detergent<br>
portion on the surface of the microparticle. The first detergent portion and the<br>
second detergent portion can comprise the same detergent or different detergents.<br>
The polymer is preferably selected from the group consisting of a poly(a-hydroxy<br>
acid), a polyhydroxy butyric acid, a polycaprolactone, a polyorthoester, a<br>
polyanhydride, and a polycyanoacrylate.<br>
[0027] In some embodiments, the first and second detergent portions comprise<br>
the same detergent. The detergent is preferably a cationic detergent, for example,<br>
CTAB. In these embodiments, about 10-90%, more preferably about 10-60%, and<br>
most preferably about 25-40% of the total detergent in the microparticle<br>
composition is in the form of the first detergent portion that is bound to the<br>
micropartides. Typically, all of the detergent is added during the course of the<br>
emulsification process.<br>
[0028] In other embodiments, the first detergent portion comprises a first<br>
detergent and the second detergent portion comprises a second detergent differing<br>
from the first detergent. Typically, the first detergent is added in the course of the<br>
emulsification process and the second detergent is added subsequent to the<br>
emulsification process, preferably concurrently with the biologically active<br>
macromolecule. Preferably the first detergent portion comprises anonionic<br>
detergent, such as PVA, and the second detergent portion comprises a cationic<br>
detergent, such as CTAB.<br>
[0029] These and other embodiments of the present invention will readily<br>
occur to those of ordinary skin in the art in view of the disclosure herein.<br>

[0032] All publications, patents and patent applications cited herein, whether<br>
supra or infra, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0033] As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular<br>
forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural references unless the content clearly<br>
dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term "microparticle" refers to one or<br>
more microparticles, and the like.<br>
A. Definitions<br>
[0034] In describing the present invention, the following terms will be<br>
employed, and are intended to be defined as indicated below.<br>
[0035] Unless stated otherwise, all percentages and ratios herein are given on a<br>
weight basis.<br>
[0036] The term "microparticle" as used herein, refers to a particle of about 10<br>
nm to about 150 µm in diameter, more preferably about 200 nm to about 30 µm in<br>
diameter, and most preferably about 500 nm to about 10 urn in diameter.<br>
Preferably, the microparticle will be of a diameter that permits parenteral or<br>
mucosal administration without occluding needles and capillaries. Microparticle<br>
size is readily determined by techniques well known in the art, such as photon<br>
correlation spectroscopy, laser diflractometry and/or scanning electron microscopy.<br>
The term "particle" may also be used to denote a microparticle as defined herein.<br>
[0037] Polymer microparticles for use herein are formed from materials that<br>
are sterilizable, non-toxic and biodegradable. Such materials include, without<br>
limitation, poly(a-hydroxy acid), polyhydroxybutyric acid, polycaprolactone,<br>
polyorthoester, polyanhydride, PACA, and polycyanoacrylate. Preferably,<br>
microparticles for use with the present invention are polymer microparticles derived<br>
from a poly(a-hydroxy acid), in particular, from a poly(lactide) ("PLA") or a<br>
copolymer of D,L-lactide and glycolide or glycolic acid, such as a poly(D,L-lactide-<br>
co-glycolide) ("PLG" or "PLGA"), or a copolymer of D,L-lactide and caprolactone.<br>
The polymer microparticles may be derived from any of various polymeric starting<br>
materials which have a variety of molecular weights and, in the case of the<br>
copolymers such as PLG, a variety of lactide:glycolide ratios, the selection of which<br>
will be largely a matter of choice, depending in part on the coadministered<br>
macromolecule. These parameters are discussed more fully below.<br>
[0038] The term "detergent" as used herein includes surfactants, dispersing<br>
agents, suspending agents, and emulsion stabilizers. Anionic detergents include,<br>
but are not limited to, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate),<br>
DSS (disulfosuccinate), sulphated fatty alcohols, and the like. Cationic detergents<br>
include, but are not limited to, cetrimide (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, or<br>
"CTAB"), benzalkonium chloride, DDA (dimethyl dioctodecyl ammonium<br>
bromide), DOTAP (dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane), and the like.<br>
Nonionic detergents include, but are not limited to, nonionic surfactants such as<br>
PVA, povidone (also known as polyvinylpyrrolidone or PVP), sorbitan esters,<br>
polysorbates, polyoxyethylated glycol monoethers, polyoxyethylated alkyl phenols,<br>
poloxamers, and the like.<br>
[0039] After microparticle formation, the detergent may be bound or unbound<br>
to the same. Where bound, the detergent can be attached to the microparticles by<br>
any mechanism including, but not limited to, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding,<br>
covalent bonding, physical entrapment, Van der Waals bonding, and bonding<br>
through hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions.<br>
[0040] The term "macromolecule" as used herein refers to, without limitation,<br>
a pharmaceutical, a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, a hormone, an enzyme, a<br>
transcription or translation mediator, an intermediate in a metabolic pathway, an<br>
immunomodulator, an antigen, an adjuvant, or combinations thereof. Particular<br>
macromolecules for use with the present invention are described in more detail<br>
below. A "complexed" macromolecule is a macromolecule which has formed an<br>
association with a detergent and which is then amenable to adsorption to a<br>
microparticle.<br>
[0041] The term "pharmaceutical" refers to biologically active compounds<br>
such as antibiotics, antiviral agents, growth factors, hormones, and the like,<br>
discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0042] The term "adjuvant" refers to any substance that assists or modifies the<br>
action of a pharmaceutical, including but not limited to immunological adjuvants,<br>
which increase or diversify the immune response to an antigen.<br>
[0043] A "porynucleotide" is a nucleic acid polymer, which typically encodes a<br>
biologically active (e.g., immunogenic or therapeutic) protein or polypeptide.<br>
Depending on the nature of the polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide, a<br>
polynucleotide can include as little as 10 nucleotides, e.g., where the porynucleotide<br>
encodes an antigen. Furthermore, a "polynucleotide" can include both double- and<br>
single-stranded sequences and refers to, but is not limited to, cDNA from viral,<br>
procaryotic or eucaryotic mRNA, genomic UNA and DNA sequences from viral<br>
(e.g. RNA and DNA viruses and retroviruses) or procaryotic DNA, and especially<br>
synthetic DNA sequences. The term also captures sequences that include any of the<br>
known base analogs of DNA and RNA. The term further includes modifications,<br>
such as deletions, additions and substitutions (generally conservative in nature), to a<br>
native sequence, preferably such that the nucleic acid molecule encodes a<br>
therapeutic or antigenic protein. These modifications may be deliberate, as through<br>
site-directed mutagenesis, or may be accidental, such as through mutations of hosts<br>
which produce the antigens.<br>
[0044] The terms "polypepude" and "protein" refer to a polymer of amino acid<br>
residues and are not limited to a minimum length of the product. Thus, peptides,<br>
oligopeptides, dimers, multimers, and the like, are included within the definition.<br>
Both full-length proteins and fragments thereof are encompassed by the definition.<br>
The terms also include modifications, such as deletions, additions and substitutions<br>
(generally conservative in nature), to a native sequence, preferably such that the<br>
protein maintains the ability to elicit an immunological response or have a<br>
therapeutic effect on a subject to which the protein is administered.<br>
[0045] By "antigen" is meant a molecule which contains one or more epitopes<br>
capable of stimulating a host"s immune system to make a cellular antigen-specific<br>
immune response when the antigen is presented in accordance with the present<br>
invention, or a humoral antibody response. An antigen may be capable of eliciting<br>
a cellular or humoral response by itself or when present in combination with<br>
another molecule. Normally, an epitope will include between about 3-15, generally<br>
about 5-15, amino acids. Epitopes of a given protein can be identified using any<br>
number of epitope mapping techniques, well known in the art. See, e.g., Epitope<br>
Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66 (Glenn E. Morris,<br>
Ed., 1996) Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey. For example, linear epitopes may<br>
be determined by e.g., concurrently synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid<br>
supports, the peptides corresponding to portions of the protein molecule, and<br>
reacting the peptides with antibodies while the peptides are still attached to the<br>
supports. Such techniques are known in the art and described in, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,708,871; Geysen et aL (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8.1:3998-4002;<br>
Geysen et aL (1986) Molec. Immunol. 23:709-715, all incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entireties. Similarly, conformational epitopes are readily<br>
identified by determining spatial conformation of amino acids such as by, eg., x-<br>
ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g.,<br>
Epitope Mapping Protocols, supra.<br>
[0046] The term "antigen" as used herein denotes both subunit antigens, i.e.,<br>
antigens which are separate and discrete from a whole organism with which the<br>
antigen is associated in nature, as well as killed, attenuated or inactivated bacteria,<br>
viruses, parasites or other microbes. Antibodies such as anti-idiotype antibodies, or<br>
fragments thereof, and synthetic peptide mimotopes, which can mimic an antigen or<br>
antigenic determinant, are also captured under the definition of antigen as used<br>
herein. Similarly, an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide which expresses a<br>
therapeutic or immunogenic protein, or antigenic determinant in vivo, such as in<br>
gene therapy and nucleic acid immunization applications, is also included in the<br>
definition of antigen herein.<br>
[0047] Further, for purposes of the present invention, antigens can be derived<br>
from any of several known viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi, as well as any of<br>
the various tumor antigens. Furthermore, for purposes of the present invention, an<br>
"antigen" refers to a protein which includes modifications, such as deletions,<br>
additions and substitutions (generally conservative in nature), to the native<br>
sequence, so long as the protein maintains the ability to elicit an immunological<br>
response. These modifications may be deliberate, as through site-directed<br>
mutagenesis, or may be accidental, such as through mutations of hosts which<br>
produce the antigens.<br>
[0048] An "immunological response" to an antigen or composition is the<br>
development in a subject of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to<br>
molecules present in the composition of interest. For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "humoral immune response" refers to an immune response mediated by<br>
antibody molecules, while a "cellular immune response" is one mediated by T-<br>
lymphocytes and/or other white blood cells. One important aspect of cellular<br>
immunity involves an antigen-specific response by cytolytic T-cells ("CTLs").<br>
CTLs have specificity for peptide antigens that are presented in association with<br>
proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and expressed on<br>
the surfaces of cells. CTLs help induce and promote the intracellular destruction of<br>
intracellular microbes, or the lysis of cells infected with such microbes. Another<br>
aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific response by helper T-cells.<br>
Helper T-cells act to help stimulate the function, and focus the activity of,<br>
nonspecific effector cells against cells displaying peptide antigens in association<br>
with MHC molecules on their surface. A "cellular immune response" also refers to<br>
the production of cytokines, chemokines and other such molecules produced by<br>
activated T-cells and/or other white blood cells, including those derived from CD4+<br>
and CD8+T-cells.<br>
[0049] A composition, such as an immunogenic composition, or vaccine that<br>
elicits a cellular immune response, may serve to sensitize a vertebrate subject by the<br>
presentation of antigen in association with MHC molecules at the cell surface. The<br>
cell-mediated immune response is directed at, or near, cells presenting antigen at<br>
their surface. In addition, antigen-specific T-lymphocytes can be generated to<br>
allow for the future protection of an immunized host.<br>
[0050] The ability of a particular antigen or composition to stimulate a cell-<br>
mediated immunological response may be determined by a number of assays, such<br>
as by lymphoproliferation (lymphocyte activation) assays, CTL cytotoxic cell<br>
assays, by assaying for T-lymphocytes specific for the antigen in a sensitized<br>
subject, or by measurement of cytokine production by T cells in response to<br>
restimulation with antigen. Such assays are well known in the art. See, e.g.,<br>
Erickson et al., J. Immunol. (1993) 151:4189-4199; Doe et al., Eur. J. Immunol.<br>
(1994) 24:2369-2376; and the examples below.<br>
[0051] Thus, an immunological response as used herein may be one which<br>
stimulates the production of CTLs, and/or the production or activation of helper T-<br>
cells. The antigen of interest may also elicit an antibody-mediated immune<br>
response. Hence, an immunological response may include one or more of the<br>
following effects: the production of antibodies by B-cells; and/or the activation of<br>
suppressor T-cells and/or ?d T-cells directed specifically to an antigen or antigens<br>
present in the composition or vaccine of interest. These responses may serve to<br>
neutralize infectivity, and/or mediate antibody-complement, or antibody dependent<br>
cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to provide protection to an immunized host. Such<br>
responses can be determined using standard immunoassays and neutralization<br>
assays, well known in the art.<br>
[0052] A composition which contains a selected antigen adsorbed to a<br>
microparticle, displays "enhanced immunogenicity" when it possesses a greater<br>
capacity to elicit an immune response than the immune response elicited by an<br>
equivalent amount of the antigen when delivered without association with the<br>
microparticle. Thus, a composition may display "enhanced immunogenicity"<br>
because the antigen is more strongly immunogenic by virtue of adsorption to the<br>
microparticle, or because a lower dose of antigen is necessary to achieve an<br>
immune response in the subject to which it is administered. Such enhanced<br>
immunogenicity can be determined by administering the microparticie/antigen<br>
composition, and antigen controls to animals and comparing antibody titers against<br>
the two using standard assays such as radioimmunoassay and ELISAs, well known<br>
in the art.<br>
[0053] The terms "effective amount" or "pharmaceutically effective amount"<br>
of a composition comprising rnicroparticles with adsorbed macromolecules, as<br>
provided herein, refer to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the<br>
rrucroparticle/rnacromolecule composition to treat or diagnose a condition of<br>
interest. For example, these expressions may refer to an amount sufficient to<br>
provide a desired response, such as an immunologica) response;, and corresponding<br>
therapeutic effect, or in the case of delivery of a therapeutic protein, an amount<br>
sufficient to effect treatment of the subject, as denned below. As will be pointed<br>
out below, the exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending<br>
on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the seventy of the<br>
condition being treated, and the particular macromolecule of interest, mode of<br>
administration, and the like. An appropriate "effective" amount in any individual<br>
case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine<br>
experimentation.<br>
[0054] By "vertebrate subject" is meant any member of the subphylum cordata,<br>
including, without limitation, mammals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goals, horses,<br>
and humans; domestic animals such as dogs and cats; and birds, including domestic,<br>
wild and game birds such as cocks and hens including chickens, turkeys and other<br>
gallinaceous birds. The term does not denote a particular age. Thus, both adult and<br>
newborn animals are intended to be covered.<br>
[0055] By "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "pharmacologically acceptable" is<br>
meant a material which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the<br>
material may be administered to an individual along with the rrdcroparticle<br>
formulation without causing any undesirable biological effects in the individual or<br>
interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition<br>
in which it is contained.<br>
[0056] The term "excipient" refers to substances that are commonly provided<br>
within finished dosage forms, and include vehicles, binders, disintegrants, fillers<br>
(diluents), lubricants, glidants (flow enhancers), compression aids, colors,<br>
sweeteners, preservatives, suspensing/dispersing agents, film formers/coatings,<br>
flavors and printing inks.<br>
[0057] By "physiological pH" or a "pH in the physiological range" is meant a<br>
pH in the range of approximately 7.2 to 8.0 inclusive, more typically in the range of<br>
approximately 7.2 to 7.6 inclusive.<br>
[0058] As used herein, "treatment" (including variations thereof, for example,<br>
"treat" or "treated") refers to any of (i) the prevention of infection or reinfection, as<br>
in a traditional vaccine, (ii) the reduction or elimination of symptoms, and (iii) the<br>
substantial or complete elimination of the pathogen or disorder in question.<br>
Treatment may be effected prophylactically (prior to infection) or therapeutically<br>
(following infection).<br>
[0059] As used herein, the phrase "nucleic acid" refers to DMA, RNA, or<br>
chimeras formed therefrom<br>
[0060] As used herein, the phrase "oligonucleotide comprising at least one<br>
CpG motif" refers to a polynucieotide comprising at least one CpG dinucleotide.<br>
Oligonucleotides comprising at least one CpG motif can comprise multiple CpG<br>
motifs. These oligonucleotides are also known as "CpG oligonucleotides" in the<br>
art. As used herein, the phrase "CpG motif* refers to a dinucleotide portion of an<br>
oligonucleotide which comprises a cytosine nucleotide followed by a guanosine<br>
nucleotide. 5-methylcytosine can also be used in place of cytosine.<br>
[0061] As used herein, "alphavirus RNA vector replicon," "RNA vector<br>
replicon," "RNA vector construct, "and "replicon" refer to an RNA molecule which<br>
is capable of directing its own amplification or self-replication in vivo, within a<br>
target cell. An alphavirus-derived RNA vector replicon should contain the<br>
following ordered elements: 5" viral sequences required in cis for replication (also<br>
referred to as 5" CSE), sequences which, when expressed, code for biologically<br>
active alphavirus nonstructural proteins (e.g., nsPl, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4), 3" viral<br>
sequences required in cis for replication (also referred to as 3" CSE), and a<br>
polyadenylate tract. An alphavirus-derived RNA vector replicon also may contain a<br>
viral subgenomic "junction region" promoter, sequences from one or more<br>
structural protein genes or portions thereof, extraneous nucleic acid molecule(s)<br>
which are of a size sufficient to allow production of viable virus, as well as<br>
heterologous sequence(s) to be expressed.<br>
[0062] As used herein, "Eukaryotic Layered Vector Initiation System,"<br>
"ELVIS, "or "ELVIS vector" refers to an assembly which is capable of directing the<br>
expression of a sequences) or gene(s) of interest. The eukaryotic layered vector<br>
initiation system should contain a 5" promoter which is capable of initiating in vivo<br>
(i.e., within a cell) the synthesis of RNA from cDNA, and a viral vector sequence<br>
which is capable of directing its own replication in a eukaryotic cell and also<br>
expressing a heterologous sequence. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid<br>
vector sequence is an alphavirus-derived sequence and is comprised of a 5"<br>
sequence which is capable of initiating transcription of an alphavirus RNA (also<br>
referred to as 5" CSE), as well as sequences which, when expressed, code for<br>
biologically active alphavirus nonstructural proteins (e.g., nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4),<br>
and an alphavirus RNA polymerase recognition sequence (also referred to as 3"<br>
CSE). In addition, the vector sequence may include a viral subgenomic "junction<br>
region" promoter, sequences from one or more structural protein genes or portions<br>
thereof, extraneous nucleic acid molecule(s) which are of a size sufficient to allow<br>
optimal amplification, a heterologous sequence to be expressed, one or more<br>

also contain splice recognition sequences, a catalytic ribozyme processing<br>
sequence, a nuclear export signal, and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
[0063] "Alphavirus vector construct" refers to an assembly which is capable of<br>
directing the expression of a sequence or gene of interest. Such vector constructs<br>
are generally comprised of a 5" sequence which is capable of initiating transcription<br>
of an alphavirus RNA (also referred to as 5" CSE), as well as sequences which,<br>
when expressed, code for biologically active alphavirus nonstructural proteins (e.g..<br>
nsPl, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4), an alphavirus RNA polymerase recognition sequence (also<br>
referred to as 3" CSE), and a polyadenylate tract. In addition, the vector construct<br>
may include a viral subgenomic "junction region" promoter, sequences from one or<br>
more structural protein genes or portions thereof, extraneous nucleic acid<br>

vectors, which comprise the cDNA complement of RNA vector constructs, RNA<br>
vector constructs themselves, alphavirus vector constructs, and the like.<br>
[0065] According to some embodiments of the present invention, compositions<br>
and methods are provided which treat, including prophylactically and/or<br>
therapeutically immunize, a host animal against viral, fungal, mycoplasma,<br>
bacterial, or protozoan infections, as well as to tumors. The methods of the present<br>
invention are useful for conferring prophylactic and/or therapeutic immunity to a<br>
mammal, preferably a human. The methods of (he present invention can also be<br>
practiced on mammals, other than humans, including biomedical research<br>
applications.<br>
B. General Methods<br>
[0066] The present inventors have found that adsorption of macromolecules to<br>
micropartides can be improved by ensuring that detergent is made available for<br>
forming a complex with the macromolecules at the time of adsorption Further, a<br>
great variety of molecules, including charged and/or bulky macromolecules, can be<br>
adsorbed. Thus the microparticle/macromolecule compositions of the present<br>
invention can be used as a delivery system to deliver the biologically active<br>
components in order to treat, prevent and/or diagnose a wide variety of diseases.<br>
[0067] The present invention can be used to deliver a wide variety of<br>
macromolecules including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics<br>
and antiviral agents, nonsteroidal antiinflarnmatory drugs, analgesics, vasodilators,<br>
cardiovascular drugs, psychotropics, neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiparkinson<br>
drugs, beta Mockers, calcium channel Mockers, bradykinin inhibitors, ACE-<br>
inhibitors, vasodilators, prolactin inhibitors, steroids, hormone antagonists,<br>
antihistamines, serotonin antagonists, heparin, chemotherapeutic agents,<br>
antineoplastics and growth factors, including but not limited to PDGF, EGF, KGF,<br>
IGF-1 and IGF-2, FGF, polynucleotides which encode therapeutic or immunogenic<br>
proteins, immunogenic proteins and epitopes thereof for use in vaccines, hormones<br>
including peptide hormones such as insulin, proinsulin, growth hormone, GHRH,<br>
LHRH, EGF, somatostatin, SNX-111, BNP, insulinptropin, ANP, FSH, LH, PSH<br>
and hCG, gonadal steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens and progesterone),<br>
thyroid-stimulating hormone, inhibin, cholecystokinin, ACTH, CRF, dynorphins,<br>
endorphins, endothelin, fibronectin fragments, galanin, gastrin, insulinotropin,<br>
glucagon, GTP-binding protein fragments, guanylin, the leukokinins, magainin,<br>
mastoparans, dermasepiin, systemin, neuromedins, neurolensin, pancreastatin,<br>
pancreatic polypeptide, substance P, secretin, thymosin, and the like, enzymes,<br>
transcription or translation mediators, intermediates in metabolic pathways,<br>
immunomodulators, such as any of the various cytokines including interleukin-1,<br>
interleukin-2, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, and gamma-interferon, antigens, and<br>
adjuvants.<br>
[0068] In a preferred embodiment the macromolecule is an antigea A<br>
particular advantage of the present invention is the ability of the microparticles with<br>
adsorbed antigen to generate cell-mediated immune responses in a vertebrate<br>
subject. The ability of the anugen/microparticles of the present invention to elicit a<br>
cell-mediated immune response against a selected antigen provides a powerful tool<br>
against infection by a wide variety of pathogens. Accordingly, the<br>
antigen/microparticles of the present invention can be incorporated into vaccine<br>
compositions.<br>
[0069] The effectiveness of the various uses of plasmid vectors and ELVIS<br>
vectors as described in the art may be enhanced by adsorbing selected plasmid and<br>
ELVIS vectors to microparticles with adsorbent surfaces, which facilitates<br>
introduction of the vector,, and of heterologous nucleic acid sequences comprised in<br>
the vector, into the cells of an animal. Alternatively, RNA vector constructs may be<br>
adsorbed to the polymer microparticles or submicron emulsions of the invention for<br>
effective delivery of heterologous nucleic acid sequences into the cells of an<br>
animal. The commonly owned U. S. Provisional Patent Application filed on<br>
September 28, 2000 (Attorney Docket No. CHIR-0270; Serial No. 60/236,105)<br>
discloses the use of such polynucleotides adsorbed to certain microparticles. Thus,<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the macromolecuJe is a polynucleoridc, such as a<br>
plasmid, an ELVIS vector, or an RNA vector construct. A particular advantage of<br>
the present invention is the ability of the microparticles with adsorbed ELVIS<br>
vector to generate cell-mediated immune responses in a vertebrate subject. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/236,105 further describes the adsorption of polypeptide<br>
antigens, including HIV polypeptide antigens, to microparticles. The ability of the<br>
antigen/ microparticles of the present invention to elicit a cell-mediated immune<br>
response against a selected antigen provides a powerful tool against infection by a<br>
wide variety of pathogens. Accordingly, the antigen/ microparticles of the present<br>
invention can be incorporated into vaccine compositions.<br>
[0070] Thus, in addition to a conventional antibody response, the system<br>
herein described can provide for, e.g., the association of the expressed antigens with<br>
class I MHC molecules such that an in vivo cellular immune response to the antigen<br>
of interest can be mounted which stimulates the production of CTLs to allow for<br>
Mure recognition of the antigen. Furthermore, the methods may elicit an antigen-<br>
specific response by helper T-cells. Accordingly, the methods of the present<br>
invention will find use with any macromolecule for which cellular and/or humoral<br>
immune responses are desired, preferably antigens derived from viral pathogens<br>
that may induce antibodies, T-cell helper epitopes and T-cell cytotoxic epitopes.<br>
Such antigens include, but are not limited to, those encoded by human and animal<br>
viruses and can correspond to either structural or non-structural proteins.<br>
[0071] The microparticles of the present invention are particularly useful for<br>
immunization against intracellular viruses which normally elicit poor immune<br>
responses. For example, the present invention will find use for stimulating an<br>
immune response against a wide variety of proteins from the herpes virus family,<br>
including proteins derived from herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, such as<br>
HSV-1 and HSV-2 glycoproteins gB, gD and gH; antigens derived from varicella<br>
zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)<br>
including CMV gB and gH; and antigens derived from other human herpesviruses<br>
such as HHV6 and HHV7. (See, e.g. Chee et al., Cytomegaloviruses (J.K.<br>
McDougall, ed., Springer-Verlag 1990) pp. 125-169, for a review of the protein<br>
coding content of cytomegalovirus; McGeoch et al., J. Gen. Virol. (1988) 69:1531-<br>
1574, for a discussion of the various HSV-1 encoded proteins; U.S. Patent No.<br>

encoding therefor; Baer et al., Nature (1984) 310:207-211, for the identification of<br>
protein coding sequences in an EBV genome; and Davison and Scott, J. Gen. Virol.<br>
(1986) 67:1759-1816, for a review of VZV.)<br>
[00721 Antigens from the hepatitis family of viruses, including hepatitis A<br>
virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), the delta hepatitis<br>
virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis G virus (HGV), can also be<br>
conveniently used in the techniques described herein. By way of example, the viral<br>
genomic sequence of HCV is known, as are methods for obtaining the sequence<br>
See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 89/04669, WO 90/11089; and WO<br>
90/14436. The HCV genome encodes several viral proteins, including El (also<br>
known as E) and E2 (also known as E2/NSI) and an N-terminal nucleocapsid<br>
protein (termed "core") (see, Houghton et al., Hepatalagy (1991) 14381-388, for a<br>
discussion of HCV proteins, including El and E2). Each of these proteins, as well<br>
as antigenic fragments thereof, will find use in the present composition and<br>
methods.<br>
[0073] Similarly, the sequence for the 5-antigen from HDV is known (see, e.g.,<br>
US Patent No 5,378,814) and this antigen can also be conveniently used in the<br>
present composition and methods. Additionally, antigens derived from HBV, such<br>
as the core antigen, the surface antigen, sAg, as well as the presurface sequences,<br>
pre-S1 and pre-S2 (formerly called pre-S), as well as combinations of the above,<br>
such as sAg/pre-S1, sAg/pre-S2, sAg/pre-S1/pre-S2, and pre-S1/pre-SZ, will find<br>
use herein. See, e.g., "HBV Vaccines - from the laboratory to license, a case study"<br>
in Mackett, M. and Williamson, J.D., Human Vaccines and Vaccination, pp. 159-<br>
176, for a discussion of HBV structure; and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,722,840, 5,098,704,<br>

Virol (1995) 69:6833-6838, Birnbaum et al., J. Virol (1990) 64:3319-3330; and<br>
Zhou et al...J. Virol. (1991)65:5457-5464<br>
[0074] Antigens derived from other viruses will also find use in the claimed<br>
compositions and methods, such as without limitation, proteins from members of<br>
the families Picomaviridae (e.g., polyviruses, etc.), Caliciviridae; Togaviridae<br>
(e.g., rubella virus, dengue virus, etc.); Flaviviridae; Coronaviridae, Reoviridae,<br>
Birnaviridae; Rhabodoviridae (e.g., rabies virus, etc.); Filoviridae; Paramyxoviridae<br>
(e.g., mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytil virus, etc),<br>
Orthomyxoviridae (e.g., influenza virus types A, B and C, etc.); Bunyaviridae;<br>
Arenaviridae; Retroviradae (e.g., HTLV-I; HTLV-II; HFV-1 (also known as HTLV-<br>
III, LAV, ARV, hTLR, etc.)), including but not limited to antigens from the isolates<br>
HIVIIIb, HIVsf2, HIVlav, HIVlai, HIVmn); HIV-Icm235, HIV-1us4; HIV-2; simian<br>
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) among others. Additionally, antigens may also be<br>
derived from human papillomavirus (HPV) and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses.<br>
See, e.g. Virology, 3rd Edition (W.K. Joklik ed. 1988); Fundamental Virology, 2nd<br>
Edition (B.N. Fields and D.M. Knipe, eds. 1991), for a description of these and<br>
other viruses.<br>
[0075] More particularly, the gp120 or gp140 envelope proteins from any of<br>
the above HIV isolates, including members of the various generic subtypes of HIV,<br>
are known and reported (see, e.g., Myers et al., Los Alamos Database, Los Alamos<br>
National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico (1992); Myers et al., Human<br>
Retroviruses and Aids, 1990, Los Alamos, New Mexico: Los Alamos National<br>
Laboratory; and Modrow et al., J. Virol. (1987) 61:570-578, for a comparison of the<br>
envelope sequences of a variety of HIV isolates) and antigens derived from any of<br>
these isolates will find use in the present methods. Furthermore, the invention is<br>
equally applicable to other immunogenic proteins derived from any of the various<br>
HIV isolates, including any of the various envelope proteins such as gpl60 and<br>
gp41, gag antigens such as p24gag and p55gag, as well as proteins derived from the<br>
pol and tat regions.<br>
[0076] Influenza virus is another example of a virus for which the present<br>
invention will be particularly useful. Specifically, the envelope gh/coproteins HA<br>
and NA of influenza A are of particular interest for generating an immune response.<br>
Numerous HA subtypes of influenza A have been identified (Kawaoka et al.,<br>
Virology (1990) 179:759-767; Webster et al., "Antigenic variation among type A<br>
influenza viruses," p. 127-168. In: P. Palese and D.W. Kingsbury (ed.), Genetics of<br>
influenza viruses. Springer-Verlag, New York). Thus, proteins derived from any of<br>
these isolates can also be used in the compositions and methods described herein.<br>
[0077] The compositions and methods described herein will also find use with<br>
numerous bacterial antigens, such as those derived from organisms that cause<br>
diphtheria, cholera, tuberculosis, tetanus, pertussis, meningitis, and other<br>
pathogenic states, including, without limitation, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria<br>
meningitides (A, B, C, Y), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Helicobacter pylori, and<br>
Haemophilus influenza. Hemophilus influenza type B (HIB), Helicobacter pylori,<br>
and combinations thereof. Examples of antigens from Neisseria meningitides B are<br>
disclosed in the following co-owned patent applications: PCT/US99/09346; PCT<br>
IB98/01665; and PCT IB99/00103. Examples of parasitic antigens include those<br>
derived from organisms causing malaria and Lyme disease.<br>
[0078] Additional antigens for use with the invention, some of which are also<br>
listed elsewhere in this application, include the following (references are listed<br>
immediately below):<br>
- A protein antigen from N, meningitidis serogroup B, such as those in Refs. 1 to 7<br>

[0079J Where a saccharide or carbohydrate antigen is used, it is preferably<br>
conjugated to a carrier protein in order to enhance immunogenicity [e.g. Refs. 47 to<br>
56]. Preferred carrier proteins are bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria or<br>
tetanus toxoids. The CRM197 diphtheria toxoid is particularly preferred. Other<br>
suitable carrier proteins include N. meningitidis outer membrane protein [e.g. Ref.<br>
57], synthetic peptides [e.g. Refs. 58, 59], heat shock proteins [e.g. Ref. 60],<br>
pertussis proteins [e.g. Refs. 61, 62], protein D from H. Influenzae [e.g. Ref. 63],<br>
toxin A or B from C. difficile [e.g. Ref. 64], etc. Where a mixture comprises<br>
capsular saccharides from both serogroups A and C, it is preferred that the ratio<br>
(w/w) of MenA saccharide:MenC saccharide is greater than 1 (e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1,<br>
5:1,10:1 or higher). Saccharides from different serogroups of N. meningitidis may<br>
be conjugated to the same or different carrier proteins.<br>
[0080] Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker<br>
where necessary.<br>
[0081] Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g.<br>
detoxification of pertussis toxin by chemical and/or means [Ref. 30].<br>
[0082] Where diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred<br>
also to include tetanus antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus<br>
antigen is included it is preferred also to include diphtheria and pertussis antigens.<br>
Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it is preferred also to include<br>
diphtheria and tetanus antigens.<br>
[0083] It is readily apparent that the subject invention can be used to deliver a<br>
wide variety of macromolecules and hence to treat and/or diagnose a large number<br>
of diseases. In some embodiments, the rnacromolecule/microparticle compositions<br>
of the present invention can be used for she-specific targeted delivery. For<br>
example, intravenous administration of the macromolecule/micropanicle<br>
compositions can be used for targeting the lung, liver, spleen, blood circulation, or<br>
bone marrow.<br>
[0084] The adsorption of macromolecules to the surface of the adsorbent<br>
microparticles occurs via any bonding-interaction mechanism, including, but not<br>
limited to, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, Van der Waals<br>
bonding, and bonding through hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art may readily select detergents appropriate for the type of<br>
macromolecule to be adsorbed.<br>
[0085] For example, microparticles manufactured in the presence of charged<br>
detergents, such as anionic or cationic detergents, may yield microparticles with a<br>
surface having a net negative or a net positive charge, which can adsorb a wide<br>
variety of molecules. For example, microparticles manufactured with anionic<br>
detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), e.g., SDS-PLG microparticles,<br>
adsorb positively charged antigens, such as proteins. Similarly, microparticles<br>
manufactured with cationic detergents, such as CTAB, e.g., PLG/CTAB<br>
microparticles, adsorb negativery charged macromolecules, such as DNA. Where<br>
the macromolecules to be adsorbed have regions of positive and negative charge,<br>
either cationic or anionic or nonionic detergents may be appropriate.<br>
[0086] Biodegradable polymers for manufacturing microparticles for use with<br>
the present invention are readily commercially available from, e.g., Boehringer<br>
Ingelheim, Germany and Birmingham Polymers, Inc., Birmingham, AL. For<br>
example, useful polymers for forming the microparticles herein include<br>
homopolymers, copolymers and polymer blends derived from the following:<br>
polyhydroxybutyric acid (also known as polyhydroxybutyrate); polyhydroxy valeric<br>
acid (also known as polyhydroxyvalerate); polyglycolic acid (PGA) (also known as<br>
polygh/colide): polylactic acid (PLA) (also known as polylactide); polydioxanone;<br>
polycaprolactone; poh/orthoester; and polyanhydride. More preferred are poly(a-<br>
hydroxy acid), such as poly(L-lactide), poly(D,L-lactide) (both known as "PLA"<br>
herein), poly(hydoxybutyrate), copolymers of D.L-lactide and grycolide, such as<br>
poh/(D,L-lactide-co-grycolide) (designated as "PLG" or "PLGA" herein) or a<br>
copoh/mer of D.L-lactide and caprolactone. Particularly preferred polymers for use<br>
herein are PLA and PLG polymers. These polymers are available in a variety of<br>
molecular weights, and the appropriate molecular weight for a given use is readily<br>
determined by one of skill in the art. Thus, e.g., for PLA, a suitable molecular<br>
weight will be on the order of about 2000 to 5000. For PLG, suitable molecular<br>
weights will generally range from about 10,000 to about 200,000, preferably about<br>
15,000 to about 150,000.<br>
(0087] If a copolymer such as PLG is used to form the microparticles, a variety<br>
of lactide:glycolide ratios will find use herein and the ratio is largely a matter of<br>
choice, depending in part on the coadministered macromolecule and the rate of<br>
degradation desired. For example, a 50:50 PLG polymer, containing 50% D,L-<br>
lactide and 50% glycolide, will provide a fast resorbing copolymer while 75:25<br>
PLG degrades more slowly, and 85:15 and 90:10, even more slowly, due to the<br>
increased lactide component. It is readily apparent that a suitable ratio of<br>
lactide:glycolide is easily determined by one of skill in the art based, for example,<br>
on the nature of the antigen and disorder in question. Moreover, mixtures of<br>
microparticles with varying lactide:glycolide ratios will find use herein in order to<br>
achieve the desired release kinetics for a given macromolecule and to provide for<br>
both a primary and secondary immune response. Degradation rate of the<br>
microparticles of the present invention can also be controlled by such factors as<br>
polymer molecular weight and polymer crystallinity. PLG copolymers with<br>
varying lactide:grycolide ratios and molecular weights are readily available<br>
commercially from a number of sources including from Boehringer Ingelheim,<br>
Germany and Birmingham Polymers, Inc., Birmingham, AL. These polymers can<br>
also be synthesized by simple polycondensation of the lactic acid component using<br>
techniques well known in the art, such as described in Tabata et al.,J. Biomed.<br>
Mater. Res. (1988)22:837-858.<br>
[0088] The microparticles are prepared using any of several methods well<br>
known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, double emulsion/solvent<br>
evaporation techniques, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,523,907 and<br>
Ogawa et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. (1988) 36:1095-1103, can be used herein to make<br>
the microparticles. These techniques involve the formation of a primary emulsion<br>
consisting of droplets of polymer solution, which is subsequently mixed with a<br>
continuous aqueous phase containing a particle stabilizer/ surfactant.<br>
[0089] In other embodiments, microparticles can also be formed using spray-<br>
drying and coacervation as described in, e.g., Thomasin et al., J. Controlled Release<br>
(1996) 41:131; U.S. Patent No. 2,800,457; Masters, K. (1976) Spray Drying 2nd<br>
Ed. Wiley, New York; air-suspension coating techniques, such as pan coating and<br>
Wurster coating, as described by Hall et al., (1980) The "Wurster Process" in<br>
Controlled Release Technologies: Methods, Theory, and Applications (A.F.<br>
Kydonieus, ed.), VoL 2, pp. 133-154 CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida and Deasy,<br>
P.B., Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. (1988) S(2):99-139; and ionic gelation as<br>
described by, e.g., Limet al., Science (1980) 210:908-910.<br>
[0090] In preferred embodiments, a water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) solvent<br>
evaporation system can be used to form the microparticles, along the lines<br>
described by O"Hagan et al., Vaccine (1993) 11:965-969, PCT/US99/17308 (WO<br>
00/06123) to O"Hagan et al. and Jeffery et al., Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362.<br>
[0091] In general, the particular polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent,<br>
such as ethyl acetate, dimethylchloride (also called methylene chloride and<br>
dichloromethane), acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, and the like. The polymer will<br>
be provided in about a 1-30%, preferably about a 2-15%, more preferably about a 3-<br>
10% and most preferably, about a 4-6% solution, in organic solvent. The polymer<br>
solution is then combined with an aqueous solution and emulsified to form an o/w<br>
emulsioa The aqueous solution can be, for example, deionized water, normal<br>
saline, or a buffered solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or a sodium<br>
citrate/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (sodium citrate/ETDA) buffer solutioa<br>
Preferably, the volume ratio of polymer solution to aqueous liquid ranges from<br>
about 5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably about 10:1. Emulsification is conducted<br>
using any equipment appropriate for this task, and is typically a high-shear device<br>
such as, e.g., an homogenizer.<br>
[0092] A volume of the o/w emulsion is then preferably combined with a<br>
larger volume of an aqueous solution, which preferably contains a cationic, anionic,<br>
or nonionic detergent. The volume ratio of aqueous solution to o/w emulsion<br>
typically ranges from about 2:1 to 10:1, more typically about 4:1. Examples of<br>
anionic, cationic and nonionic detergents appropriate for the practice of the<br>
invention are listed above and include SDS, CTAB and PVA. respectively. Certain<br>
macromolecules may adsorb more readily to microparticles having a combination<br>
of detergents, for example, a combination of PVA and DOTAP. Moreover, in some<br>
instances, it may be desirable to add detergent to the above organic solution. Where<br>
a nonionic detergent such as PVA is used, it is typically provided in about a 2-15%<br>
solution, more typically about a 4-10% solution. Where a cationic or anionic<br>
detergent is used, it is typically provided in about a 0.05-5% solution, more<br>
typically about a 0.25-1% solution. Generally, a weight to weight detergent to<br>
polymer ratio in the range of from about 0.00001:1 to about 0.5:1 will be used,<br>
more preferably from about 0.0001:1 to about 6.5:1, more preferably from about<br>
0.001:1 to about 0.5:1, and even more preferably from about 0.005:1 to about 0.5:1.<br>
[0093] The mixture is then homogenized to produce a stable w/o/w double<br>
emulsion. Organic solvents are then evaporated. The formulation parameters can<br>
be manipulated to allow the preparation of small microparticles on the order of 0.05<br>
µm (50 nm) to larger microparticles 50 um or even larger. See, e.g., Jeffery et al.,<br>
Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368;McGee et al., J. Microencap. (1996). For<br>
example, reduced agitation results in larger microparticles, as does an increase in<br>
internal phase volume. Small particles are produced by low aqueous phase volumes<br>
with high concentrations of emulsion stabilizers.<br>
[0094] A preferred apparatus for performing the above steps is schematically<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1. Referring now to Fig. 1, a manufacturing tank assembly,<br>
generally designated by the numeral 102, is shown. The tank assembly 102 is<br>
designed to be a "dosed system," such that an aseptic environment is maintained<br>
during processing. All pieces of equipment and parts are preferably selected to be<br>
clean-in-place and autoclavable. All filters 104a-d are preferably fluoropolymer<br>
filters such as Super-Cheminert™ all-Ouoropolymer filters from Pall Corporation.<br>
Initially, an aqueous solution, such as a sodium citrate/ETDA buffer system 106<br>
and an organic polymer solution, such as a solution of PLG in methylene chloride<br>
108, are filtered and fed into tank 110 where they are continuously mixed with<br>
mixer 112. The mixture is then fed through an in-line homogenizer 114 (e.g., a<br>
high speed, high shear autoclavable in-line homogenizer such as the Kinematica<br>
MT 5000), forming an o/w emulsion. The emulsion is cooled, for example by a<br>
water-cooled condenser 116, after emerging from the in-line homogenizer 114,<br>
whereupon it is returned to the tank 110. After the contents are emulsified to the<br>
desired extent, an aqueous detergent solution, for example a solution of CTAB in<br>
water 118, is added to the tank 110, whereupon a w/o/w emulsion is formed by<br>
again feeding the contents through the in-line mixer 114. After sufficient<br>
emulsification, the resulting w/o/w emulsion is purged with nitrogen via distributor<br>
119 to remove the organic solvent. The nitrogen-laden solvent vapor is filtered and<br>
cooled in a condenser 120, capturing the solvent in container 122.<br>
[0095] In embodiments where a relatively large weight to weight detergent to<br>
polymer ratio is used (e.g., detergent to polymer ratios of about 0.05:1 to about<br>
0.5:1, more preferably about 0.10:1 to about 0.50:1, and most preferably about<br>
0.2:1 to about 0.4:1), it is desirable to wash the particles to remove excessive<br>
amounts of detergent. Typically, this washing step is performed after the organic<br>
solvent is removed from the final emulsion, for example, by solvent evaporation<br>
(like that performed in connection with Fig. 1), by solvent extraction or both.<br>
[0096] In some embodiments, the microparticles are washed by centrifugatioa<br>
This process reduces the overall amount of detergent and leads to a final<br>
composition mat contains relatively small amounts of unbound detergent relative to<br>
bound detergent. For instance, in Example 2 below, the washing steps that are<br>
performed (i.e., washing with water by centrifugation four times) yields<br>
microparticles having about 1% w/w CTAB, of which more than 99% is bound to<br>
the microparticles, and less than 1% is found in unbound form.<br>
[0097] In other more preferred embodiments, the microparticles are subjected<br>
to a detergent-reducing process that nonetheless retains significant amounts of the<br>
detergent in unbound form. For instance, a cross-flow filtration step may be<br>
performed to retain a substantial amount of unbound detergent. Typically, a<br>
filtration step of this type yields microparticles containing about 0.2 to 5% w/w<br>
detergent overall, of which approximately 10 to 60% is bound to the microparticles,<br>
and approximately 40-90% is found in unbound form. More preferably,<br>
approximately 25 to 40% is bound to the microparticles, and approximately 60-75%<br>
is unbound. For instance, in the procedure described in Example 5 below,<br>
microparticles are produced having about 1% w/w CTAB overall, of which<br>
approximately 30% is bound to the microparticles, and approximately 70% is<br>
unbound.<br>
[0098] In embodiments where a sufficiently small detergent to polymer ratio is<br>
used (eg., detergent to polymer ratios of about 0.001:1 to 0.05:1, more preferably<br>
about 0.002:1 to about 0.04:1 and even more preferably about 0.006 to about<br>
0.02:1, it is not necessary to wash the microparticles to remove excessive amounts<br>
of detergent. Typically, a process of this type yields microparticles having about<br>
0.2 to 5% w/w detergent, of which approximately 10 to 60% is bound to the<br>
microparticles, and approximately 40-90% is found in unbound form. More<br>
preferably, approximately 25 to 40% is bound to the microparticles, and<br>
approximately 60-75% is found in unbound form For instance, in the procedure<br>
described in Example 6 below, microparticles are produced having approximately<br>
1 % w/w CTAB, of which approximately 30% is bound to the microparticles, and<br>
approximately 70% is unbound.<br>
[0099] Particle size can be determined by, e.g., laser light scattering, using for<br>
example, a spectrometer incorporating a helium-neon laser. Generally, particle size<br>
is determined at room temperature and involves multiple analyses of the sample in<br>
question (e.g., 5-10 times) to yield an average value for the particle diameter.<br>
Particle size is also readily determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).<br>
Following preparation, microparticles can be stored as is or lyopbilized for future<br>
use. In order to adsorb macromolecules to the microparticles, the microparticle<br>
preparation can be simply mixed with the macromolecule of interest and the<br>
resulting formulation can again be lyophilized prior to use. However, as noted<br>
above, the present inventors have found that adsorption of macromolecules to the<br>
polymer microparticles can be improved by ensuring that a substantial amount of<br>
detergent in unbound form is present at the time of macromolecule adsorption. In<br>
the case where very little of the detergent in the as-prepared microparticle<br>
composition is present in unbound form (e.g., approximately 5% or less), it is<br>
preferred to incubate the microparticles with both the macromolecule and an<br>
additional quantity of detergent Preferably a weight to weight detergent to<br>
macromolecule ratio of about 0.002:1 to 0.05:1, more preferably about 0.005 to<br>
0.02:1 is used.<br>
[0100] On the other hand, where substantial amounts of the detergent in the as-<br>
prepared micioparticle composition is present in unbound form (eg, approximately<br>
50-90% unbound, more preferably approximately 60-75%), good results can be<br>
achieved by simply incubating the microparticles with the macromolecule of<br>
interest, with the use of additional detergent being optional.<br>
(0101] Without wishing to be bound by theory, in both of the above cases it is<br>
believed that unbound detergent is available to complex with the macromolecule of<br>
interest, rendering the macro molecule more amenable to adsorption to a<br>
micropartide.<br>
[0102] Generally, macrornolecules are added to the microparticles to yield<br>
micraparticles with adsorbed macromolecules having a weight to weight ratio of<br>
from about 0.0001:1 to 0.25.1 macromolecules to microparticles, preferably,<br>
0.001:1 to 0.1:1, more preferably 0.01:1 to 0.05:1. Macromolecule content of the<br>
microparticles can be determined using standard techniques<br>
[0103) The microparticles of the present invention may have macromolecules<br>
entrapped or encapsulated within them, as well as having macrornolecules adsorbed<br>
thereon. Thus, for example, one of skill in the art may prepare in accordance with<br>
the invention microparticles having encapsulated adjuvants with proteins adsorbed<br>
thereon, or microparticles having encapsulated proteins with adjuvants adsorbed<br>
thereon One of skill in the art may likewise prepare in accordance with the<br>
invention macroparticles having encapsulated adjuvants with completed ELVIS<br>
vectors adsorbed thereon, or microparticles having encapsulated antigen with<br>
nucleic acid plasrnids adsorbed thereon. The invention cootemplates a variety of<br>
combinations of complexed macromolecules adsorbed on and strapped within<br>
microparticles, along with other macromolecules such as antigenic molecules.<br>
[0104] Once the macromolecule-adsorbed microparticles are produced, they<br>
are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions, including vaccines, to treat and/or<br>
diagnose a wide variety of disorders, as described above. The compositions will<br>
generally include one or more pharmaceuticalry acceptable excipients. For<br>
example, vehicles such as water, saline, giycerol, polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic<br>
acid, ethanol, etc. may be used. Other excipients, such as wetting or emulsifying<br>
agents, biological buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such<br>
vehicles. A biological buffer can be virtually any solution which is<br>
pharmacologically acceptable and which provides the formulation with the desired<br>
pH, i.e., a pH in the physiological range. Examples of buffer solutions include<br>
saline, phosphate buffered saline, Tris buffered saline, Hank"s buffered saline, and<br>
the like. Other excipients known in the art can also be introduced into the final<br>
dosage form, including binders, disintegrants, fillers (diluents), lubricants, glidants<br>
(flow enhancers), compression aids, colors, sweeteners, preservatives,<br>
suspensing/dispersing agents, film formers/coatings, flavors and printing inks.<br>
[0105] Adjuvants may be used to enhance the effectiveness of the<br>
hannaceutical compositions. The adjuvants may be administered concurrently with<br>
the microparticles of the present invention, e.g., in the same composition or in<br>
separate compositions. Alternatively, an adjuvant may be administered prior or<br>
subsequent to the microparticle compositions of the present invention. In another<br>
embodiment, the adjuvant, such as an immunological adjuvant, may be<br>
encapsulated in the microparticle. Adjuvants, just as any macromolecules, may be<br>
encapsulated within the microparticles using any of the several methods known in<br>
the art. See, e.g., U.S Patent No. 3,523,907, Ogawa et at, Chem Pharm. Bull.<br>
(1988) 36:1095-1103; O"Hagan et aL, Vaccine (1993) 11:965-969 and Jefferey et<br>
al, Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362. Alternatively, adjuvants may be adsorbed on the<br>
microparticle as described above for any macromolecuie.<br>
[0106] Immunological adjuvants include, but are not limited to: (1) aluminum<br>
alts (alum), such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulfate,<br>
etc ; (2) other oil-in water emulsion formulations (with or without other specific<br>
immunostimulating agents such as muramyl peptides (see below) or bacterial cell<br>
wall components), such as for example (a) MF59 (International Publication No.<br>
WO90/14837; Chapter 10 in Vaccine design: the subunit an adjuvant approach,<br>
eds. Powell &amp; Newman, Plenum Press 1995), containing 5% Squalene, 0.5%<br>
Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally containing various amounts of MTP-PE<br>
(see below), although not required) formulated into submicron particles using a<br>
microfluidizer such as Model HOY microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA),<br>
(b) SAF, containing 10% Squalane, 0.4% Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked polymer<br>
LI 21, and thr-MDP (see below) either microfluidized into a submicron emulsion or<br>
vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and (c) Ribi™ adjuvant system<br>
(RAS), (Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT) containing 2% Squalene, 0.2% Tween<br>
80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of<br>
monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton<br>
(CWS), preferably MPL + CWS (Detox™) (for a further discussion of suitable<br>
submicron oil-in-water emulsions for use herein, see commonly owned, patent<br>
application no. 09/015,736, filed on January 29,1998); (3) saponin adjuvants, such<br>
as Quil A, or QS21 (e.g., Stimulon™ (Cambridge Bioscience, Worcester, MA))<br>
may be used or parade generated therefrom such as ISCOMs (immunostimulating<br>
complexes), which ICOMS may be devoid of additional detergent e.g.,<br>
WOOO/07621; (4) Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freunds<br>
Adjuvant (IFA); (5) cytokines, such as interleukins (e.g. IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-<br>
6, IL-7, IL-12 (WO99/44636), etc.), interferons (e.g. gamma interferon),<br>
macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), etc.;<br>
(6) monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) or 3-O-deacylated MPL (3dMPL) e.g. GB-<br>

[0109] The compositions will comprise a "therapeutically effective amount" of<br>
the macromolecule of interest. That is, an amount of macro molecule/ microparticle<br>
will be included in the compositions which will cause the subject to produce a<br>
sufficient response, in order to prevent, reduce, eliminate or diagnose symptoms.<br>
The exact amount necessary will vary, for example, depending on the subject being<br>
treated; the age and general condition of the subject to be treated; the severity of the<br>
condition being treated; in the case of an immunological response, the capacity of<br>
the subject"s immune system to synthesize antibodies; the degree of protection<br>
desired and the particular antigen selected and its mode of administration, among<br>
other factors. An appropriate effective amount can be readily determined by one of<br>
skill in the art. Thus, a "therapeutically effective amount" will typically fall in a<br>
relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. For example,<br>
for purposes of the present invention, where the macromolecule is a polynucleotide,<br>
an effective dose will typically range from about 1 ng to about 1 mg, more<br>
preferably from about 10 ng to about 1 ug, and most preferably about 50 ng to<br>
about 500 ng of the macromolecule delivered per dose; where the macromolecule is<br>
an antigen, an effective dose will typically range from about 1 ug to about 100 mg,<br>
more preferably from about 10 ug to about 1 mg, and most preferably about 50 ug<br>
to about 500 ug of the macromolecule delivered per dose.<br>
[0110] Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered<br>
parenteralh/, e.g., by injection. The compositions can be injected either<br>
subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly. Other modes<br>
of administration include nasal, mucosal, rectal, vaginal, oral and pulmonary<br>
administration, suppositories, and transdermal or transcutaneous applications.<br>
[0111] Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose<br>
schedule. A multiple dose schedule is one in which a primary course of<br>
administration may be with 1-10 separate doses, followed by other doses given at<br>
subsequent time intervals, chosen to maintain and/or reinforce the therapeutic<br>
response, for example at 1-4 months for a second dose, and if needed, a subsequent<br>
dose(s) after several months. The dosage regimen will also, at least in part, be<br>
determined by the need of the subject and be dependent on the judgment of the<br>
practitioner.<br>
(0112] Furthermore, if prevention of disease is desired, the macromolecules in<br>
vaccines, are generally administered prior to primary infection with the pathogen of<br>
interest. If treatment is desired, e.g., the reduction of symptoms or recurrences, the<br>
macromolecules are generally administered subsequent to primary infection.<br>
Experimental<br>
(0113] Below are examples of specific embodiments for carrying out the<br>
present invention. The examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br>
(0114] Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers<br>
used (e.g., amounts, temperatures, etc.), but some experimental error and deviation<br>
should, of course, be allowed for.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Blank. Microparticles Using PVA<br>
(0115] Blank microparticles (e.g., without adsorbed or entrapped<br>
macromolecules) were made using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as follows. Solutions<br>
used:<br>
(1) 6% RG 504 PLG (Boehringer Ingelheim) in dichloromethane.<br>
(2) 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (ICN) in water.<br>
[0116] In particular, the microparticles were made by combining 10 ml of<br>
polymer solution with 1.0 ml of distilled water and homogenizing for 3 minutes<br>
using an Omni benchtop homogenizer with a 10 mm probe at 1 OK rpm to form a<br>
water/oil (w/o) emulsion. The w/o emulsion was added to 40 ml of the 10% PVA<br>
solution, and homogenized for 3 minutes, to form a water/oil/water (w/o/w)<br>
emulsioa The w/o/w emulsion was left stirring overnight for solvent evaporation,<br>
forming microparticles. The formed microparticles were washed with water by<br>
centrifugation 4 times, and lyophilized. The microparticles were then sized in a<br>
Malvern Master sizer for future use.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Blank Micropartides Using CTAB<br>
[0117] Blank microparticles were produced using CTAB as follows. Solutions<br>
used:<br>
(1) 4% RG 504 PLG (Boehringer Ingelheim) in dimethyl chloride.<br>
(2) 0.5% CTAB (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in water.<br>
[0118] In particular, the microparticles were made by combining 12.5 ml of<br>
polymer solution with 1.25 ml of distilled water and homogenizing for 3 minutes<br>
using an Omni benchtop homogenizer with a 10 mm probe at 10K rpm to form a<br>
w/o emulsion. The w/o emulsion was added to 50 ml of the 0.5% CTAB solution<br>
and homogenized for 3 minutes to form a w/o/w emulsion. The w/o/w emulsion<br>
was left stirring g vemight for solvent evaporation, forming microparticles. The<br>
formed microparticles were then filtered through a 38 u. mesh, washed with water<br>
by centrifugation 4 times, and lyophilized. The microparticles were then sized in a<br>
Malvern Master sizer for future use.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation qf Blank Microparticles Using SDS<br>
[0119] Blank microparticles were produced using SDS as follows. Solutions<br>
used:<br>
(1) 6% RG 504 PLG (Boehringer Ingelheim) in dimethyl chloride<br>
(2) 1% SDS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in water.<br>
[0120] In particular, the microparticles were made by combining 12.5 ml of<br>
polymer solution with 50 ml of the SDS solution and homogenizing for 3 minutes<br>
using an Omni benchtop hotnogenizer with a 10 mm probe at 10K. rpm The<br>
emulsion was left stirring overnight for solvent evaporation. The formed<br>
microparticles were filtered through a 38 µ mesh, washed with water by<br>
centrifugation 4 times, and lyophilized for future use. The microparticles were then<br>
sized in a Malvem Master sizer for future use.<br>
Example 4<br>
Microparticles with Adsorbed Complex of DNA/CTAB<br>
[0121] Blank PLG/PVA microparticles were preformed using the standard<br>
solvent evaporation method. For a 1 gin batch size, 2 ml of deionized water (DI)<br>
was homogenized with 16 ml volume of a 6% w/v solution of RG 504 (PLG<br>
Polymer) in dichloromethane (DCM). This emulsion was homogenized for 2<br>
minutes and to this mixture, 60 ml of a 10% w/v solution of polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(PVA) was added. The multiple emulsion was further homogenized for 3 minutes<br>
and then put on a magnetic stirrer for overnight solvent evaporation. The resultant<br>
microparticles were washed twice with deionized water and freeze dried. The<br>
microparticles were sized and were found to be around 1 um in size.<br>
[0122] For preparing the DNA formulation, 100 mg of PLG/PVA<br>
microparticles were incubated with 1 mg of CTAB and 1 mg of DNA (pCMV-<br>
p55gag) in a 5 ml volume of TE buffer. The suspension was gently stirred overnight<br>
at 4 C for complete adsorption. The microparticles were centrifuged once at 5000<br>
rpm and the pellet washed once with 50 ml of TE buffer. The resultant pellet was<br>
suspended in 3 mi of DI water and the microparticles were freeze-dried.<br>
[0123] The actual DNA adsorbed was estimated by both depletion<br>
(measurement of the supernatant) and base hydrolysis of the microparticles. The<br>
DNA load was found to be 0.91 % w/w and the loading efficiency 91%.<br>
[0124] 10 mg of the formulation did not release any free DNA in vitro in 1 ml<br>
ofTE buffer at day 1.<br>

Preparation of Blank Microparticles Using CTAB<br>
Cross-flow Filtration Technique<br>
[0125] Blank microparticles are produced using CTAB as follows. Solutions<br>
used: (1) 6% RG 504 PLG (Boehringer Ingetheim) in methylene chloride, (2) 0.5%<br>
CTAB (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in water, (3) sodium citrate/EDTA in<br>
water. The microparticles are made in an apparatus like that illustrated in Fig. 1 by<br>
combining 80 ml of polymer solution with 10 ml of sodium citrate/EDTA solution<br>
in the tank with constant mixing. The mixture is then homogenized in the in-line<br>
homogenizer until an o/w emulsion with a disperse phase (water phase) having a<br>
mean particle size of 1-2 microns is achieved. At this point 310 ml CTAB solution<br>
is added to the tank with constant mixing. The mixture is then homogenized in the<br>
in-line homogenizer until a stable w/o/w emulsion with a disperse phase (o/w<br>
phase) having a mean particle size of 1- microns is achieved. The resulting w/o/w<br>
emulsion is purged with nitrogen to remove the organic solvent, and the as-formed<br>
microparticles are filtered using a 0.1 micron cross-flow filter cassette from<br>
Millipore, using a total of 4.0 liters of deionized water to remove excess CTAB.<br>
After final cross-flow filtration, the suspension is collected, which comprises<br>
approximately 1 % CTAB, of which 30% is present in bound form and 70% is<br>
present in unbound form.<br>

Non-washing technique<br>
[0126J Blank microparticles are produced using CTAB as follows. Solutions<br>
used: (1) 6% RG 504 PLG (Boehringer Ingelheim) in methylene chloride, (2)<br>
0.01825% CTAB (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in water, (3) sodium<br>
citrate/EDTA in water. The microparticles are made in an apparatus like that<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1 by combining 300 ml of polymer solution with 60 ml of sodium<br>
citrate/EDTA solution in the tank with constant mixing. The mixture is then<br>
homogenized in the in-line homogenizer until a o/w emulsion with a disperse phase<br>
(water phase) having a mean particle size of 1 micron is achieved. At this point 1.8<br>
liters of CTAB solution are added to the tank with constant mixing. The mixture is<br>
then homogenized in the in-line homogenizer until a stable w/o/w emulsion with a<br>
disperse phase (o/w phase) having a mean particle size of 1 micron is achieved.<br>
The resulting w/o/w emulsion is purged with nitrogen to remove the organic<br>
solvent. The microparticle suspension is sized in a Malvern Master sizer for future<br>
use. These microparticles comprise approximately 1% CTAB, of which 30% is<br>
present in bound form and 70% is present in unbound form.<br>

Immunogenicity of Microparticles with Adsorbed p55 DNA<br>
[0127] A DNA formulation is prepared by incubating 100 mg of the<br>
microparticle suspension (in a 10ml volume) formed in Example 6 with 1.0 mg of<br>
DNA (a pCMVgag plasmid encoding HIV p55 gag protein under the control of the<br>
cytomegalovirus early promoter) in a 0.5 nl volume of Tris-EDTA buffer. The<br>
suspension is incubated at 4°C for 12 hours. Following incubation, the DNA-<br>
loaded microparticles are centrifuged, washed with Tris-EDTA buffer, suspended in<br>
deionized water and freeze-dried (ryophilized). The DNA loading of the resulting<br>
microparticles is approximately 1 % w/w.<br>
[0128] The DNA-loaded microparticles are then injected intramuscularly in<br>
mice at two total DNA levels. DNA alone is also injected at the same two levels as<br>
a control. Each formulation is injected into ten mice. The mice were boosted after<br>
28 days. Two weeks after the second immunization, serum is collected and the<br>
geometric mean titer (GMT) of each serum is measured, along with its standard<br>
error (SE). The results are summarized in the following table:<br>
