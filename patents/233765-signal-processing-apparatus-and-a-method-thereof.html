				<td> FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present application generally relates to apparatuses such as television signal processing apparatus, that process radio frequency signals. More specifically, the present application is particularly useful in integrated circuits that combine circuitry operating in a synchronous-sampling mode that must be adapted for use with a fixed rate sampling mode application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present application generally relates to apparatuses such as television signal processing apparatus, that process radio frequency signals. More specifically, the present application is particularly useful in integrated circuits that must combine circuitry operating in a synchronous-sampling mode that must be adapted for use with a fixed rate sampling mode application.<br>
Modern signal processing apparatus typically include signal processing circuitry for processing a multitude of signal formats, such as NTSC, ATSC, QAM, or satellite signals. Such a signal processing apparatus typically includes various components such as a tuner for selecting a particular signal or channel from a plurality of signals or channels received by the apparatus. To process digital signals, such as ATSC or satellite signals, the signal processing circuitry, and in particular the tuner, must perform these functions with high-speed digital circuitry. Some digital signal processing apparatus operate in a synchronous-sampling mode, where the A/D converter takes samples coincident with the digital symbol locations. The digital symbols, and subsequently the sampling frequency are calculated by the demodulator and a rate control signal is output from the demodulator to control the<br><br>
sampling rate of the A/D.   It is also possible to take samples using an A/D converter at a fixed time intervals.<br>
It is often a major design change in terms of time and expense to convert a design originally intended to operate in synchronous-sampling mode to operate in a fixed-rate sampling mode. This is primarily due to the requirement for an enable signal to be provided to all of the memory elements in the design. An enable signal is required throughout the design to identify when processing is to proceed since the demodulator is running at a high rate and not every clock signal is accompanied by a digital symbol. A thorough knowledge of the original design is usually required to effectuate the design change and re-verification is required to be carried out. In situations of design reuse, it would be advantageous to introduce a preprocessing block that can convert the fixed rate samples to synchronous samples with requiring the necessity of an enable line.<br>
Furthermore, in digital signal processing applications, there are typically many different clocks used to drive the processing circuitry. These clocks are typically derived from a phase-locked loop (PLL). When the data is gathered through an A/D converter, using the PLL output to clock the A/D converter can degrade its performance as high speed A/D converters are sensitive to clock jitter. When an externai clock is used to drive the A/D converter, a synchronization problem arises because of the unknown phase between the A/D clock and the PLL output clock. Previously, designers have used clock resynchronizers or back to back flip flops on the reference clock and PLL clock lines. This solution is based on the assumption that a "bad phase" occurs only some of the time. However, if the system starts up in the "bad phase" it will continue to operate constantly at the bad phase. This results in the data latching and putting the system into an unstable state. Therefore the robustness of the back-to-back flip flop approach is questionable. It is desirable to have an A/D clock to be used by the digital signal processing circuitry that is synchronized to the PLL output clock to facilitate latching the A/D output and preventing problems associated with clock jitter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a signal processing apparatus signal processing apparatus comprising a source of a fixed rate digital signal, a signal processor operating in a synchronous-sampling mode for producing a control signal representing a symbol rate, and an interpolator responsive to the control signal for processing the fixed rate digital signal to yield samples at the symbol rate.<br>

Signal receiving element 110 is operative to receive signals including audio, video and/or auxiliary data from signal sources, such as radio frequency broadcast signal transmission sources, or cable television transmission. Signal receiving element 110 may be embodied as any signal receiving element such as an antenna, input terminal or other element.<br>
Tuner 130 is operative to tune signals including audio, video and/or auxiliary data signals. Accordingly, tuner 130 may tune signals for the main picture of television signal processing apparatus 100. According to an exemplary embodiment, television signal processing apparatus 100 may further include a picture-in-picture (PIP) function wherein the first channel includes audio and/or video signals for a main picture, and a second channel (not shown) includes audio and/or video signals for the PIP function. Demodulator 140 is operative to demodulate signals provided from tuner 130, and may demodulate signals in analog and/or digital transmission formats.<br>
Decoder 170 is operative to decode signals including audio, video and/or auxiliary data signals provided from the demodulator 140. According to an exemplary embodiment, decoder 170 decodes digital data that represents program guide data or emergency alert signals indicating an emergency event. Decoder 170 may also perform other decoding functions, such as decoding data which represents auxiliary data signals included in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of an analog television signal.<br><br>
Processor and memory 180 are operative to perform various processing, control, and data storage functions of television signal processing apparatus 100. j According to an exemplar/ embodiment, processor 180 is operative to process the audio and video signals provided f rom decoder 170, and may for example perform analog processing, such as National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) signal processing and/or digital processing, such as Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) processing.<br>

Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of digital signal processing circuitry 200 comprising A/D converter 220 operating according to a fixed rate sampling mode concurrently with subsequent signal processing circuitry, such as a demodulator 240, operating according to a synchronous sampling mode is shown. The digital signal processing circuitry further comprises a tuner 210,<br><br>
interpolator 230, clock generator 260, and phase locked loop (PLL) 250 as well as a fixed rate clock 270.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the tuner 210 outputs an intermediate frequency (IF) analog signal. The A/D converter 220 takes samples of the IF analog signal at a fixed sampling rate. These fixed rate samples are taken at times corresponding to the digital clock signal input into the A/D converter 220 by the fixed rate clock 270. The fixed rate samples are read at the fixed rate by the interpolator 230 and a discrete number of samples are stored by the interpolator 230, the number of samples depending on the interpolation method used by the interpolator 230.<br>
The interpolated samples are then interpolated to yield samples at the symbol rate or some integer multiple thereof in the Interpolator 230 based on the rate control signal from the demodulator 240. In a synchronous sampling mode of operation, the rate control signal might have originally been used to control the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCXO). As such, the interpolator 230 is designed such that its rate control input nas the effect of mimicking the effect of this rate control signal going to a VCXO on the data samples delivered to demodulator 240. The interpolator 230 operates using the fixed rate clock 270, whereas the demodulator 240 runs on a burst clock generated by the clock generator 260. The burst clock is enabled by the interpolator 230 when there are samples in the interpolator 230 ready to be processed by the demodulator 240. There may be more than one clock frequency generated by the clock generator 260 going to the demodulator 240 and subsequent synchronous sampling mode circuitry. AII of these clocks are allowed to run for 1 symbol of time for every symbol extracted from the interpolator 230. For example, a clock running at 8 times the symbol rate would be allowed to run for 8 periods for every symbol taken from the interpolator 230.<br>

In FIG. 3, the clock generator circuitry 300 comprises an A/D converter 310, a PLL 350, a clock divider 360, and a demodulator 340. The clock divider 360 is used to synchronize the clock generated by the PLL and the reference clock, which is further explained in the discussion of Fig. 4, as well as creating multiple integers of the synchronized clock signal to be used by subsequent signal processing circuitry.<br>
Referrmg to FIG. 4, a diagram of a clock divider circuitry 400 of a clock generator accordmg to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. In FIG. 4, the clock dividor circuitry 400 comprises a plurality of D flip-flops 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 460, 465, 470, a plurality of AND gates 430, 435, 440, 445, a plurality of OR fates 250, 255. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown m Fig. 4, five D fhp-flops 405, 410, 415, 420, and 425 are used to create a delay line for the reference clock. The PLL clock is used to advance the state of the delay line. The group of logic elements comprising the AND gates 430, 435, 440, 445 and the<br>
state of the outputs of the first D flip-flop 405, the second D flip-flop 410, the fourth D filp-flop 420, and the fifth D flip-flop are compared using the group of logic elements 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455. The 1X clock is then passed through a final D flip-flop 460 to complete the synchronization of the reference clock with the PLL clock.<br>
