				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to polyurethane microcapsules containing biocide and process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, the invention describes preparation of polyurethane microcapsules containing biocide, especially Irgarol (algaecide) and Zinc Pyrithione (fungicide). Microcapsules obtained by the process of the present invention range in size from one micron to hundred microns.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Biocides are chemical compounds, which are toxic to microbial cells and are added to different types of products to prevent the growth of unwanted microorganisms. Reduction in biocidal activity is mostly attributed to the factors such as chemical degradation of biocide, fast dissipation of biocide from application site due to washing out and /or volatilization. The life of any product where biocide is applied, will be more if these biocides are retained in the product / application site for longer period. This extended duration of biocidal activity can be achieved by incorporating biocide in Controlled Release (CR) form. Microcapsule is one of the best controlled release form, wherein an active agent (core material) is surrounded by a polymer film. This is achieved by a process called microencapsulation. Different techniques of microencapsulation are known which include phase separation, interfacial polymerization and mechanical methods such as spray drying. Numbers of reviews on microencapsulation techniques have appeared in literature, (i) Arshady R. (Editor), Microspheres, Microcapsules and Liposomes, Vol. 1 and 2, 1999 and Vol. 6 , 2003 Citus Book,<br>
UK (ii) Benita S. (Editor), Microencapsulation-Methods and Industrial Applications, 1996, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York; (iii) Madan P. L., Asian J. Pharm. Sci., 9, 1979, pi; (iv) Thies C. In: Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 9, Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1987, p 724 and (v) Porte H. and Couarrze G., In: Hand book of Powder Technology, 9 (Powder Technology and Pharm. Processes) 1994, p 513). U.S. patents disclosing various microencapsulation methods have been consolidated (Gutcho M. "Microcapsules and Microencapsulation Techniques", New York, Noyes Data, 1976).<br>
Controlled Release Biocides:<br>
Controlled Release (CR) biocides has been the subject of interest to many researchers. CR concept and work was initiated first time on antifouling paints using chloroprene polymer by N.F. Cardarelli ( Cardarelli N.F., Chapter 3 In Controlled Release Technologies: Methods, Theory &amp; Applications, Ed. Kydonieus A. F., 1980, CRC Press Inc., USA). Antifouling marine paint compostion containing gelation microcapsules of water-immiscible biocide has been described in US Patent No. 4,253,877. Yet another US Patent (No. 5378413) describes preparation of gelatin microcapsules containing fouling reducing agents and their use in paint system. Another report describes extended control of marine fouling using formulation of microencapsulated organometallic biocide and vinyl rosin paint. ( Porter R. and Miale J. B., Appl. Biochem. and Biotech. , 9 (1984), p 439-445 (CA 102:162052)).<br>
Apart from CR antifouling formulations there have been very few reports on CR of other biocides. Biocide namely 4,5-dichloro-n-octyl-3-isothiazolinone<br>
(DCOI) can be encapsulated in a variety of polysiloxane matrices using sol-gel chemistry (Ghosh T. and Nungesser E. N., Proc. Int. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater., 25 (1998), p 324 ). The skin sensitization potential of active agent (3-isothiazolone) in loci such as water-based marine antifouling paint of decorative is reduced by encapsulating the active agent in polyurea (. EP 679333 (1995), (CA 123: 332738). The fungicide tebuconazole and chlorothalonil were successfully incorporated into polyvinylpyridine (PVPy) and polyvinylpyridine-co-styrene nano particles ( Liu Y. et. al. , J. Appl. Poly. Sci, 79 (2001), p 458-465).<br>
US Patent (No. 4915947) describes preparation of microencapsulated<br>
phytotoxic fungicides using crosslinked polyurea or polyamide to provide an<br>
effective agent for direct foliar application to control fungal diseases on crops.<br>
Urea -formaldehyde (UF) and /or melamine formaldehyde (MF) resins have been<br>
used to prepare microcapsules of fungicide namely 3-Iodo-2-propynylbutyl<br>
carbamate. These microcapsules when incorporated into exterior latex paint and<br>
applied onto rubberwood panels on exposing to the environment showed longer<br>
protection from discoloration. (Ibrahim W. A. et. al. , Pertanika 12 (1989) p 409-<br>
412 (CA 114:25832)). The acrylic latex exterior paint containing microcapsules<br>
of	fungicides	2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-methylsulfonylpryidine	and<br>
tetrachloroisophthaonitrile have been reported to show good mildew protection ( Noren G. K. et. al. , J. Coatings Tech. 58 (1986), p 31-39 (CA 104: 188225) ). Another patent describes encapsulation of biocide using MF resin and their use in coating material like plaster having silicate, mineral or polymer resin binder or a primer based on a silicate or polymer resin binder ( Patent WO 2004000953  ).<br>
The patent describes preparation of microcapsules containing Zinc Pyrithione using MF resin but does not specify the size of the microcapsules obtained.<br>
Japanese patent (No. JP 2003104802) describes antibacterial aqueous dispersion compositions containing microencapsulated dithioles or 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide and other microbiocides like Zinc Pyrithione. The patent does not describe preparation of microcapsules of Zinc Pyrithione but mentions that Zinc Pyrithione is added to composition containing microcapsules of other compounds as mentioned above. Polyurethane microcapsules:<br>
Preparation of polyurethane microcapsules containing variety of active agents using aqueous continuous phase is known in the literature, (i) Fuyuma H., shinjo G. and Tsuji K., J. Pesticide Sci., 9, 1984, p 511 (ii) Choi K.y., Min K. S., Park I. FL, Kim K. S. and Chang T., Polymer (Korea), 14, 1990, p 392 (iii) Ohtsuti T., Polymer, 32, 1991, p 2395 (iv) JP 04, 76016 (v) Reddy P.V.S, Mahesh G. N. Ramesh S., Sivakumar P. A. and Radhakrishnan G., Macromolecular Reports, A32 (suppls. 5 &amp; 6), 1995, p789 (v) JP 05, 194, 128 (CA 119:154041) (vi) JP 05, 201,814 (CA 119: 197763) (vii) Kim I. H, et. al., Polymer (Korea), 26, 2002, p 400-409 (CA 137:155715) (viii) Hong k. and Park S., Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers , 42, 1999, p 193-200 (ix) Frere Y. et al. , Eur. Poly. J. , 34, 1998, p 193-199. Methods described in these reports involve use of aqueous phase and thus are only useful to encapsulate water insoluble active agents. Also the encapsulating wall material formed due to presence of water may contain polyurea moieties along with polyurethane.<br>
US Patent No. 5,603,986 discloses preparation of. polyurethane microcapsules containing coloring agents, catalysts and UV absorbents using non-aqueous continuous phase wherein block copolymer based on polydimefhylsiloxane and polyalkylene oxide is used as surfactant. Applicants in their earlier invention ( US Patent No. 5,962,003) have described preparation of polyurethane microcapsules containing water-soluble pesticide monocrotophos in non-aqueous medium. Block copolymer consisting of one block of diene or olefin polymer and another block of poly (alkylene oxide) was synthesized and used as surfactant.<br>
Biocides play an important role in variety of applications. However reduction in biocidal activity due to factors such as chemical degradation of biocide and/or fast dissipation of biocide from the application site due to reasons like washing out with water, is a problem which leads to decrease in period of effectiveness of biocide.<br>
In the prior art there neither exists any product like microcapsules of Irgarol and Zinc Pyrithione, in particular with specified particle size of 1-100 microns This is the first time that the microencapsules of Irgarol and Zinc Pyrithione have been prepared, for being used in paint.<br>

ADVANTAGES<br>
Biocides play an important role in variety of applications. However, reduction in biocidal activity due to factors such as chemical degradation of biocide and/or fast dissipation of biocide from the application site due to reasons like washing out with water is a problem which leads to decrease in period of effectiveness of biocide. Microencapsulated biocide will prolong the life of biocide and being encapsulated in polymer will result in less environmental pollution which unencapsulated biocide may cause.<br><br><br><br>
