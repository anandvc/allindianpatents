				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The dish-washer comprises a steel body in which are housed two cage-like stands. Used dishes are placed upside down on them. A set of three pipes with small-small holes, connected on either side with another two pipes, and suspended on steel/iron railings to facilitate movement from left to right and right to left, runs through these stands. This set of pipes is connected to a water pump by a rubber pipe which in turn is connected to hot and cold water tanks. Water runs through these pipes and falls on the dishes. Initially, hot water, mixed with cleaning liquid, is allowed to run through these pipes. It gushes out of the holes and falls on the dishes with great speed and pressure. The set of pipes is then moved from left to right and right to left so that water falls evenly on all the dishes. This process is repeated a number of times so that all the dishes are cleaned. After that, the process is repeated with plain cold water to rinse the dishes. Used water is then drained out. This system uses less water and cleans the dishes in a hygienic manner, in a very short time.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a dish-washer, a kitchen device for washing dishes mechanically.<br>
The crude method of washing dishes is by hands which is not only time-consuming, but also needs a lot of water and is psychologically repulsive. This dish-washer aims to minimize the housewife's daily chores. It is also the object of this invention to have a device which is very simple in construction, easy for operation and also available at an affordable price.<br>
Thus, according to this invention, a dish-washer for washing dishes mechanically, comprises a set of three pipes having a number of small-small holes, connected on either side by another two pipes, and housed in a steel body; said pipes are suspended on iron/steel railings in such a way that these can all be simultaneously oscillated from left to right and from right to left by means of a handle; the said steel body contains two cage-like stands for keeping the dishes; the said pipes are placed in such a way that the upper stand has a pipe above and a pipe beneath it and the lower stand has a pipe beneath it; the said pipes have an inlet which is connected to the outlet of a water pump through a flexible rubber pipe; the said water pump has an inlet connected to the outlets of hot and cold water tanks; the said hot and cold water tanks have stop-cocks so that at a given time either the hot or the cold water will pass through the pump; the said stands have, beneath them, a very fine net that filters water before it goes down into the hot water tank; the said hot and cold water tanks have inlets connected to the tap; the said hot water tank has a drainage pipe that can be opened or closed as per requirement.<br>
Now the invention will be more clearly described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2 of accompanying drawings wherein Fig.l shows the layout diagram of the dish-washer and Fig.2 shows the set of pipes suspended on iron/steel railings in movement from left to right and from right to left.<br>
Referring to Figs.l and 2, two cage-like stands (1) and (2) are housed in a steel body (12). On stand no.(l) are placed container dishes (like tumblers, bowls, etc.) and on stand no.(2) are kept other dishes like plates, knives, forks, spoons, etc. in their respective spaces. Three pipes having a large number of small-small holes are placed in the body like<br>
this - pipe number (3) above stand number (1), pipe number (4) beneath stand number (1) and pipe number (5) beneath stand number (2). These pipes are interconnected by means of long pipes on either side, i.e. pipes numbered (6) and (7). These pipes are hanging on iron/steel railings (21 to 26) and thus all of them can be simultaneously oscillated from left to right and from right to left by means of a handle (27). Beneath stand number (2) and pipe number (5) is a very fine net (8) which filters water before allowing it to flow down into the hot water tank. Beneath this very fine net are two water tanks - one for hot water (9) and the other for cold water (10). The hot water tank is fitted with a heater (11) to heat the water. The temperature of water is controlled by a thermostat. The upper portion of both these tanks is one and slanted so that all the water passes down into the hot water tank through an opening (19). Both the tanks are fitted with the inlet pipe (28) of a water pump (13). The outlet of this pump is connected with the inlet of pipe number (6) through a flexible rubber pipe (14). The pipe connecting hot and cold water tanks with the inlet of pump has stop-cocks (15) and (16) so that at a time either the hot water or the cold water will pass through the pump. These two tanks are fitted with a pipe (17) to fill water from a tap (18).<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
To start, used dishes are placed on the stands. Tumblers, bowls, etc. are placed upside down on stand number (1) and other dishes like plates, knives, forks, spoons, etc. are placed in their respective spaces on stand number (2). Water is filled in both the tanks. Some cleaning liquid is poured inside the hot water tank (9). Heater (11) is switched on. When the temperature of the water reaches a certain point, the heater is automatically switched off. The supply of hot water to water pump (13) is opened. When the water pump is switched on, it sucks hot water and transmits it to pipe number (6). The hot water mixed with cleaning liquid is then distributed to all the pipes and forces its way out from the tiny holes with great speed and pressure. The entire block of pipes numbered (3) to (7) is then moved from left to right and from right to left by a handle (27). As the pipes move, hot water mixed with cleaning liquid is uniformly put on the inner and outer bodies of all the dishes. Food particles and oil etc. fall down and remain in the net (8) below.<br>
The water passes through the net and goes back into the hot water tank and is thus recycled a number of times in a span of 2-3 minutes with the result that all the dishes have been washed with the cleaning liquid mixed hot water and have been thoroughly cleaned. They have only to be rinsed now.<br>
For rinsing, the pump is first switched off, drainage pipe (20) connected to hot water tank is opened, cold water tank (10) is connected to water pump and hot water supply shut down. The heater is also switched off. The pump is switched on again. Now cold water passes through the pipes and the movement of the block of pipes from left to right and from right to left is repeated. The water is not recycled now but allowed to drain out. After about 1 minute all the cold water is used and has passed through the pipes and fallen on all the dishes. All the dishes are rinsed. Now they can either be taken off the shelves or allowed to remain there to become completely dry.<br>
The entire process of washing about 60-70 dishes is thus completed in less than 5 minutes.<br>
Thus this invention is very simple and most effective for washing dishes.<br>
ADVANTAGES This system saves a lot of time otherwise spent on washing dishes manually, uses less water and cleans the dishes in a hygienic manner untouched by hands.<br><br><br><br><br>
