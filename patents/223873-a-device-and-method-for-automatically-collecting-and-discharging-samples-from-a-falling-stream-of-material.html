				<td>The present invention relates to a device and method for automatically collecting<br>
and discharging samples from a falling stream of material, like sinter, iron ore,<br>
etc. through discharge chute of a conveyor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the existing system, sample from a stream can be collected manually.<br>
Sampling is based on the theory of probability. When the theory of probability is<br>
applied to continuous flowing streams the random withdrawal' is made by a<br>
sample cutter moving across the stream. The more frequently the sample is<br>
withdrawn from the stream the more accurate the final sample will be.<br>
However, in manual collection of samples variables in feed streams such as<br>
particle size segregation in belt loading and settling out of particles due to<br>
velocity change cannot be avoided.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore is to automatically collect the<br>
representative samples from the falling stream without manual intervention.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to collect the sample automatically<br>
from a falling stream within a short span of time.<br>
A further object of the invention is to ensure that the container for collecting the<br>
sample is not overfilled during sample collection.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to automatically discharge the collected<br>
sample at the collection point.<br>
These and other objects of the invention can be achieved by automatically<br>
cutting and collecting samples from a falling stream by forward and reverse<br>
movement of the collecting container within a short period of time of say 10 to<br>
12 seconds. The sample collected can be automatically discharged.<br>
The most satisfactory way to minimize variables in feed streams such as particle<br>
size segregation in belt loading, settling out of particles due to velocity change is<br>
to sample the material while it is in motion at a point of free - fall discharge<br>
making a cut at right angle to the stream.<br>
Since there may be segregation or changed composition within the stream, good<br>
practice demands a sample of the total stream. When a sample cutter<br>
continuously moves across a stream at a uniform speed the sample taken<br>
represents a small portion of the entire stream. If the cutter moves through the<br>
stream at regular intervals it produces increment samples that are considered<br>
representative of the stream at the time the sample was taken.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a device for automatically collecting and<br>
discharging samples from a falling stream of materials like sinter, iron ore, etc.<br>
through a discharge chute of a conveyor, said device comprising: a drive unit<br>
with a carriage assembly mounted on a carriage track; a sample cutter driven by<br>
said carriage assembly at a uniform speed across a falling stream of materials for<br>
automatically collecting samples at preset regular intervals; said sample cutter<br>
provided with a bucket having a door mechanism at its bottom for automatically<br>
discharging the collected sample at a parking station.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention can now be described with the help of the non-limiting figures of<br>
the drawings, where<br>
Figure 1 shows the top (plan) view of the device.<br>
Figure 2 shows the front (elevation) sectional view of the device.<br>
Figure 3 shows the side sectional view of the device.<br>
Figure 4 shows the flow chart for the sampling process.<br>
Figure 5 shows in block diagram form the input / output sequence<br>
control of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The sampling device of the present invention comprises a drive unit and a<br>
sample collector unit.<br>
The dust proof drive unit consists of a chain driven carriage assembly mounted<br>
on a steel carriage track 3. The carriage assembly consists of a fabricated steel<br>
carriage with replaceable drive plate and four pre-lubricated and sealed ball<br>
bearing wheels. The carriage drives the sample cutter through a rigid linkage 4.<br>
The unit is driven by a three phase AC geared motor. The unit can be a SEW<br>
EURO DRIVE geared motor of 0.7 KW, with an output speed at 59 rpm and<br>
torque of 99 NM. The unit is designed and constructed to withstand the stresses<br>
and shock loads of starting, stopping, entering and leaving the falling stream. It<br>
is also provided with two proximity switches and limit switches 6 and the cabling<br>
connection to the terminal. The unit is covered by a fabricated cover which<br>
stops the dust from entering the drive unit.<br>
The sample collector unit is a completely automatic 'straight-line' sampler. It<br>
cuts the falling stream at right angle at a uniform speed. As mentioned it is<br>
driven by the drive unit through a rigid link 4. The sample cutter bucket 7<br>
moves on the rail with a profile on its bottom side in the parking zone. The<br>
sample bucket has a door mechanism on its bottom. It is hinged and guided by<br>
roller travelling along the bottom of the rail. While moving along the track the<br>
sample bucket is guided by four wheels on the bottom side of rail. The bottom<br>
guide rollers are pressed against the bottom surface of rail during the movement<br>
of sample bucket. During its movement in collecting the sample the door of the<br>
sample cutter is kept closed by these rollers while moving along the track and<br>
collecting and bringing the sample to the parking position 8. At the parking<br>
position 8 they follow the profile cut in the rail. While following the profile the<br>
door opens and discharges the collected sample at the parking station.<br>
In order to stop the possibility of derailment four wheels have been provided in<br>
the inner side to guide the lateral movement of sample bucket.<br>
The sampling device of the present invention is designed to collect sample from<br>
the discharge chute of a conveyor carrying the material (sinter, iron ore, etc.)<br>
automatically. The operator's interface has a provision of two modes of<br>
operation, i.e. "Auto; and Manual'. For that a two position selector switch is<br>
provided at the main control desk at main control room. The two positions are<br>
'Interlock' and 'Delock' respectively. The operator has to put the selector switch<br>
at 'Interlock' mode for the automatic operation of the sampler. It will take one<br>
sample immediately. Then after every fixed time period (settable in the<br>
programmable logic controller), it will go on taking sample without operator's<br>
intervention. In case of any unwanted situation and to carryout maintenance job<br>
the operator has the liberty of putting it into 'Delock' mode. In that case he has,<br>
to go near the machine to operate the sampler by pressing the push button<br>
switches provided at the local control post.<br>
The Input / Output - sequence control comprising examining by the<br>
programmable logic controller the healthiness of different field inputs associated<br>
with the system. They are as follows:<br>
- Electrical status<br>
- Emergency stop push button not pressed<br>
- Status of the selector switch at interlock mode<br>
- Running status of conveyor<br>
- Home (Parking) position limit switch is activated<br>
- Is the stipulated time elapsed since last cycle of sampling.<br>
If all the above conditions are healthy, It satisfies the logic and sequence to<br>
generate the output command for running the sampler In auto mode. The<br>
sampler completes one cycle operation of sampling, stops there at home<br>
(parking) position and waits there till the command for next cycle comes. It<br>
takes about 6 to 8 seconds to complete one cycle (to and fro motion) without<br>
changing the direction of rotation of the motor. In case of any abnormality the<br>
operator at the control room will get audible alarm with message text<br>
The Block diagramme for Input / output - sequence control is given in Figures 5<br>
which also outlines the steps to be controlled by the PLC.<br>
The system cabling and accessories comprise connection to the power circuit<br>
through three core 4 sq. mm cable for motor power. Apart from that it also<br>
connected to the PLC through 1.5 sq. mm cable for different I/Os, namely<br>
'emergency stop, start and stop push button, home position limit switch' etc.<br>
The selector switch at the main control desk is connected to the PLC through 1.5<br>
sq. mm cable. All these accessories are the integrated parts of the Sampling<br>
unit.<br>
The flow diagram of the sampling process is shown in Figure 4 which provides<br>
the details of the operational logic of the system.<br>
Thus the device of the present invention automatically closes the bottom door of<br>
sample cutter while moving along the track and collecting and bringing the<br>
sample to parking position.<br>
The sample of sinter, iron ore and other materials are collected without manual<br>
intervention.<br>
The bottom door of the sample cutter is automatically opened in the parking<br>
position to allow the collected sample to be discharged. The device can be<br>
operated at preset times of say every three hours, which can be set by the<br>
operator.<br>
The sample collecting and discharging device of the present invention is operable<br>
automatically from a remote location.<br>
