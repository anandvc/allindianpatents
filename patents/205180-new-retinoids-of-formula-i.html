NEW RETINOIDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF EMPHYSEMA<br>
The invention relates to novel retinoid compounds and methods of synthesis thereof. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds for the preparation of medicaments for treating or preventing different diseases, methods of using these novel retinoid compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.<br>
The retinoids are structural analogues of vitamin A and include both natural and synthetic compounds. Retinoid compounds such as all trans retinoic acid ("ATRA"), 9~cis-retinoic acid, trans 3-4 didehydroretinoic acid, 4-oxo retinoic acid, 13-cw-retinoic acid and retinol are pleiotrophic regulatory compounds that influence a large number of inflammatory, immune and structural cells.<br>
For example, retinoids modulate epithelial cell proliferation, morphogenesis in lung and differentiation through a series of hormone nuclear receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily. The retinoid receptors are classified into the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR) each of which consists of three distinct subtypes (a, p and y).<br>
ATRA is the natural ligand for the retinoic acid receptors and binds with similar affinity to the a, p and y subtypes. A quantitative structure-activity relationship has been established for a number of synthetic RAR cc, p and y retinoid agonists, which has elucidated the principal electronic and structural characteristics that provide selective affinity for each RAR subtype (Douget et aL9 Quant. Struct Act. Relat, 18,107,1999).<br>
ATRA does not bind to RXR, for which 9-cis-retinoic acid is the natural ligand. A<br>
number of synthetic RXR a, p and y retinoid agonists have also been described in the art (See, e.g., Billoni et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,962,508; Klaus et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,986,131.<br>
In tissues other than pulmonary tissues, retinoids typically have anti-inflammatory effects, can alter the progression of epithelial cell differentiation and may inhibit stromal cell matrix production. These biological effects of retinoids have led to the development of many topical agents for dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, acne, and hypertrophic cutaneous scars. Retinoids have also been used in the treatment of light and age damaged skin, the<br><br>
healing of wounds caused, for example, by surgery and burns (Mustoe etaL, Science 237,1333 1987; Sprugel et al., J. Pathol, 129,601,1987; Boyd, Am. J. Med., 86,568,1989) and as antiinflammatory agents for treatment of arthritis. Other medicinal applications of retinoids include the control of acute promyelocyte leukemia, adeno and squamous cell carcinoma and hepatic fibrosis. Retinoids have also been used extensively in treatment of premalignant epithelial lesions and malignant tumors (carcinomas) of epithelial origin (Bollag etaL, United States PatentNo. 5,248,071; Sporn et al, Fed. Proc. 1976,1332; Hong etal., "Retinoids and Human Cancer" in The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine, M. B. Sporn, A. B. Roberts and D.S. Goodman (eds.) Raven Press, New York, 1994,597-630). However, many retinoids previously studied often lack selectivity and consequently exert harmful pleiotrophic effects and may cause patient death when used in therapeutically effective amounts. Thus, the therapeutic use of retinoids in diseases other then cancer has been limited by toxic side effects. A general review of retinoids can be found in Goodman &amp; Gilman's *The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", 9th edition (1996, McGraw-Hill) Chapters 63-64.<br>
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ("COPD") refers to a large group of lung diseases which prevent normal respiration. Approximately 11 % of the population of the United States has COPD and available data suggests that the incidence of COPD is increasing. Currently, COPD is the fourth leading cause of mortality in the United States.<br>
COPD is a disease in which the lungs are obstructed due to the presence of at least one disease selected from asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The term COPD was introduced because these conditions often co-exist and in individual cases it may be difficult to ascertain which disease is responsible for causing the lung obstruction (1987 Merck Manual). Clinically, COPD is diagnosed by reduced expiratory flow from the lungs that is constant over several months and in the case of chronic bronchitis persists for two or more consecutive years. The most severe manifestations of COPD typically include symptoms characteristic of emphysema.<br>
Emphysema is a disease where the gas-exchange structures (e.g., alveoli) of the lung are destroyed, which causes inadequate oxygenation that may lead to disability and death. Anatomically, emphysema is defined by permanent airspace enlargement distal to terminal bronchioles (e.g., breathing tubes) which is characterized by reduced lung elasticity, decreased<br><br>
alveolar surface area and gas exchange and alveolar destruction that results in decreased respiration. Thus, the characteristic physiological abnormalities of emphysema are reduced gas exchange and expiratory gas flow-Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of emphysema although other environmental toxins may also contribute to alveoli destruction. The injurious compounds present in these harmfril agents can activate destructive processes that include, for example, the release of excessive amounts of proteases that overwhelm normal protective mechanisms, such as protease inhibitors present in the lung. The imbalance between proteases and protease inhibitors present in the lung may lead to elastin matrix destruction, elastic recoil loss, tissue damage, and continuous lung function decline. The rate of lung damage may be decreased by reducing the amounts of toxins in the lung (Le.9 by quitting smoking). However, the damaged alveolar structures are not repaired and lung function is not regained At least four different types of emphysema have been described according to their locations in the secondary lobule; panlobar emphysema, centrilobular emphysema, distal lobular emphysema and paracicatrical emphysema.<br>
The major symptom of emphysema is chronic shortness of breath. Other important symptoms of emphysema include but are not limited to chronic cough, coloration of the skin caused by lack of oxygen, shortness of breath with minimal physical activity and wheezing. Additional symptoms that may be associated with emphysema include but are not limited to vision abnormalities, dizziness, temporary cessation of respiration, anxiety, swelling, fatigue, insomnia and memory loss. Emphysema is typically diagnosed by a physical examination that shows decreased and abnormal breathing sounds, wheezing and prolonged exhalation. Pulmonary function tests, reduced oxygen levels in the blood and a chest X-ray may be used to confirm a diagnosis of emphysema.<br>
No effective methods for reversing the clinical indications of emphysema currently exist in the act In some instances, medications such as bronchodilators, p-agonists, theophylline, anticholinergics, diuretics and corticosteroids delivered to the lung by an inhaler or nebulizer may improve respiration impaired by emphysema. Oxygen treatment is frequently used in situations where lung function has been so severely impaired that sufficient oxygen cannot be absorbed from the air. Lung reduction surgery may be used to treat patients with severe emphysema. Here, damaged portions of the lung are removed, which allows the normal<br><br>
portions of the lung to expand more fully and benefit from increased aeration. Finally, lung transplantation is another surgical alternative available to individuals with emphysema, which may increase quality of life but does not significantly improve life expectancy.<br>
Alveoli are formed during development by division of sacchules that constitute the gas-exchange elements of the immature lung. The precise mechanisms governing formation of septa and their spacing remain currently unknown in primates. Retinoids such as ATRA, which is a multifunctional modulator of cellular behavior that may alter both extracellular matrix metabolism and normal epithelial differentiation, have a critical regulatory role in mammals such as the rat For example, ATRA modulates critical aspects of lung differentiation through binding to specific retinoic acid receptors that are selectively temporally and spatially expressed. Coordinated activation of different retinoic acid receptors subtypes has been associated with lung branching, alveoli2ation/septation and gene activation of tropoelastin in neonatal rats.<br>
During alveolar septation, retinoic acid storage granules increase in the fibroblastic mesenchyme surrounding alveolar walls (Liu et al, Am. J. Physiol 1993,265, L430; McGowan et aL9 Am. J. Physiol, 1995,269, L463) and retinoic acid receptor expression in the lung peaks (Ong et al, Proc. Natl Acad. ofScl, 1976,73,3976; Grummer et al.9 Pediatr. Pulm. 1994,17,234). The deposition of new elastin matrix and septation parallels depletion of these retinoic acid storage granules. Postnatal administration of retinoic acid has been shown to increase the number of alveoli in rats, which supports the concept that ATRA and other retinoids may induces alveoli formation (Massaro et ai, Anu J. Physiol, 270, L305,1996). Treatment of newborn rat pups with dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid, prevents septation and decreases expression of some sub-types of retinoic acid receptor. Supplemental amounts of ATRA have been shown to prevent dexamethasone inhibition of alveoli formation. Further, ATRA prevents dexamethasone from diminishing retinoic acid receptor expression and subsequent alveolar septation in developing rat lung.<br>
ATRA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema (Massaro et aL9 Nature Med., 1997,3,675; "Strategies to Augment Alveolization," National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, RFA: HL-98-011,1998; Massaro et al9 United States PatentNo. 5,998,486).<br><br>
However, the mechanism of action of ATRA in these studies remains undefined, although Massaro reports that ATRA generates new alveoli. More importantly, the use of ATRA presents several toxicity or adverse effects concerns.<br>
Thus, novel retinoid agonists useful for treating dermatological disorders, emphysema and cancer without the toxicity problems of ATRA or other retinoids are highly desirable.<br>
The current invention provides novel retinoid agonists, a method for the synthesis, the use of such compounds for the preparation of medicaments for treating or preventing emphysema, cancer and dermatological disorders, methods of treating or preventing such diseases, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the treatment or prevention of such diseases, and methods for delivering formulations of novel retinoids into the lung of a mammal suffering from emphysema, cancer and dermatological disorders.<br>

Protection of 212 as ketal 214 was followed by conversion to aldehyde 216 by sequential treatment with n-butyl lithium and N-formylpiperidine. Horner-Emmons olefination with the appropriated phosphonate provided 218 and deprotection was followed by reprotection to the bis-acetate 220 with acetic anhydride in pyridine. Free radical bromination of 220 gives bromide 222 which may be directly displaced with an appropriate nucleophile to provide compounds where m = 1 or may be homologated with appropriate carbon nucleophiles to provide compounds where m is greater than 1.<br><br><br>
Compounds of Formula 1 where A = CH2 and B = CH2O may be prepared as described in Scheme 13. Treatment of intermediate 80 with an appropriate heteroaromatic micleqphile under basic conditians(e.g. pyrazole, and potassium tert-butoxide in THF) affords 224.

Compounds of the invention disclosed herein are useful for promoting the repair of damaged alveoli and septation of alveoli. Thus, methods of the invention may be employed to treat pulmonary diseases such as emphysema. The methods of treatment using a compound of the invention disclosed herein also may be used to treat cancer and dermatological disorders.<br>
The retinoic acid receptor agonist selectivity of a compound of the invention may be determined by using ligand binding assays known to the skilled artisan (Apfel et aL7 Proc. Natl Acad. ScL9 (1992), 89,7129; Teng et aL9 /. Med Chenu, (1997), 40,2445; Bryce et aU United States Patent No. 5,807,900 which are herein incorporated by reference). Treatment with RAR agonists, particularly RAR y agonists may promote repair of alveolar matrix and septation, which are in important in treating emphysema. Preferably, compounds of the invention are y selective agonists that bind to the y receptor with affinities between about 25 nm and about<br><br>
compositions may be formulated in conventional maimer using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of compounds of the invention into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
For topical administration a compound of the invention may be formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc. as are well-known in the art.<br>
Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection, e.g.7 subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection, as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral or pulmonary administration. Systemic formulations may be made in combination with a further active agent that improves mucociliary clearance of airway mucus or reduces mucous viscosity. These active agents<br>
include but are not limited to sodium channel blockers, antibiotics, N-acetyl cysteine,<br>
*<br>
homocysteine and phospholipids.<br>
For injection, a compound of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. The solution may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the invention may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, a compound of the invention can be readily formulated by combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. For oral solid formulations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, suitable excipients include fillers such as sugars, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP); granulating agents and binding agents. If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. If desired, solid dosage forms may be sugar-coated or enteric-coated using standard techniques. Methods for formulating retinoid agonists for oral administration have been described in the art (See, e.g., the formulation of Accutane®, Physicians * Desk Reference 54th Ed., p. 2610,2000).<br>
For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water, saline, alkyleneglycols (e.g., propylene glycol), polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycol) oils, alcohols, slightly acidic buffers between pH 4 and pH 6 (e.g.9 acetate, citrate, ascorbate at between about 5.0 mM to about 50.0 mM) etc. Additionally, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, bile salts, acylcarnitines and the like may be added.<br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated in conventional manner.<br>
A compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the lung by inhalation for the treatment of emphysema (see e.g., Tong et al, PCT Application, WO 97/39745; Clark et cd., PCT Application, WO 99/47196, which are herein incorporated by reference). For administration by inhalation, a compound of the invention may be conveniently delivered to the lung by a number of different devices. For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler C"MDI') which utilizes canisters that contain a suitable low boiling propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas may be used to deliver compounds of the invention directly to the lung. MDI devices are available from a number of suppliers such as 3M Corporation, Aventis, Boehringer Ingleheim, Forest Laboratories, Glaxo-Wellcome, Schering Plough and Vectura.<br>
Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) device may be used to administer a compound of the invention to the lung (See, e.g.,. Raleigh et al., Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Research Annual Meeting, (1999), 40,397, which is herein incorporated by reference). DPI devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a cloud of dry powder inside a container, which may then be inhaled by the patient DPI devices are also well known in the art and may be purchased from a number of vendors which include, for example, Rsons, Glaxo-Wellcome, Inhale Therapeutic Systems, ML Laboratories, Qdose and Vectura. A popular variation is the multiple dose DPI ("MDDPF) system, which allows for the delivery of more than one therapeutic dose. MDDPI devices are available from companies such as<br><br>
AstraZeneca, GlaxoWellcome, IVAX, Schering Plough, SkyePharma and Vectura. For example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch for these systems.<br>
Another type of device that may be used to deliver a compound of the invention to the lung is a liquid spray device supplied, for example, by Aradigm Corporation. Liquid spray systems use extremely small nozzle holes to aerosolize liquid drug formulations that may then be directly inhaled into the lung.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a nebulizer device is used to deliver a compound of the invention to the lung. Nebulizers create aerosols from liquid drug formulations by using, for example, ultrasonic energy to form fine particles that may be readily inhaled (see e.g., Verschoyle et aL9 British /. Cancer, (1999), u, SuppL 2,96, which is herein incorporated by reference). Examples of nebulizers include devices supplied by Sheffield/Systemic Pulmonary Delivery Ltd. (See, Armer et aL9 United States Patent No. 5,954,047; van der linden et aL, United States Patent No. 5,950,619; van der Linden et al, United States Patent No. 5,970,974, which are herein incorporated by reference), Aventis and Batelle Pulmonary Therapeutics.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, an electrohydrodynamic ("EHD") aerosol device is used to deliver a compound of the invention to the lung. EHD aerosol devices use electrical energy to aerosolize liquid drug solutions or suspensions (see e.g., Noakes et dLt United States Patent No. 4,765,539; Coffee, United States Patent No. 4,962,885; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 94/12285; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 94/14543; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/26234, Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/26235, Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/32807, which are herein incorporated by reference). The electrochemical properties of a compound of the invention formulation may be important parameters to optimize when delivering this compound to the lung with an EHD aerosol device and such optimization is routinely performed by one of skill in the art. EHD aerosol devices may more efficiently deliver drugs to the lung than existing pulmonary delivery technologies. Other methods of intra-pulmonary delivery of a compound of the invention will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid spray devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a compound of the invention with a<br><br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. Pref erably, the pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene glycol or a perfluorocarbon* Optionally, another material may be added to alter the aerosol properties of the solution or suspension of compounds of the invention. Preferably, this material is liquid such as an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid. Other methods of formulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in aerosol devices are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, United States Patent No. 5,112,598; Biesalski, United States Patent No. 5,556,611, which are herein incorporated by reference)<br>
A compound of the invention may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of the invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a compound of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt<br>
Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles that may be used to deliver a compound of the invention. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. A compound of the invention may also be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. BiomecL Eng., (1987), u, 201; Buchwald et aL, Surgery, (1980), u, 507; Saudek et al., N. Engl J. Med, (1989), 321,574), In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. MacromoL Set Rev. Macromol. Chenu, (1983), 23,61; see also Levy et al, Science (1985), 228,190; During et al.Ann. Neurol, (1989), 25,351; Howard et al, (1989), J. Neurosurg. 71, 105). In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of a compound of the invention, e.g., the lung, thus requiring only a fraction of the<br><br>
systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115 (1984)). Other controlled-release system may be used (see e.g., Langer, Science, (1990), 249,1527).<br>
When a compound of the invention is acidic, it may be included in any of the above-described formulations as the free acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pro-drug, solvate or hydrate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts substantially retain the activity of the free acid and may be prepared by reaction with bases. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include any known suitable salts of retinoic acids known in the art for administration to mammals. Pharmaceutical salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than the corresponding free acid form. Similarly, a compound of the invention may be included in any of the above-described formulations as a solvate, hydrate or pro-drug. Preferred pro-drugs include hydrolyzable ester derivatives such as aromatic esters, benzyl esters and lower alkyl esters such as ethyl, cyclopentyl etc. Other pro-drugs are known to those of skill in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
A compound of the invention, or compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. Of course, it is to be understood that the amount used will depend on the method of administration.<br>
For use to treat or prevent emphysema, cancer or dermatological disorders, compounds of the invention or compositions thereof, are administered or applied in a therapeutically effective amount Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of the invention for systemic administration may be found in the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br>
The pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds of the invention is predictable and can be described by using linear pharmacokinetic theory. Importantly, the pharmacokinetics of compounds of the invention in humans may be readily determined by one of skill in the art The skilled artisan may determine a range of standard pharmacokinetic parameters after single oral dosing with a compound of die invention using procedures described in the art (see e.g., Khoo et aL, 7. Clin. Pharm, (1982), 22,395; Colburn et aU J. Clin. Pharm, (1983), 23,534; Colburn et aL9 Eur. J. Clin. Pharm., (19), 23,689). The skilled artisan may also measure values of these pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple dosing, following procedures described in the art, to determine whether induction or accumulation of the compound of the<br><br>
invention occurs under these circumstances (Brazzel et al.y Eur. J. Clin. Pharm., (1983), 24, 695; Lucek et aL, Clin. Pharmacokinetics, (1985), 10,38). Those of skill in the art may estimate the appropriate systemic dosage levels of compounds of the invention necessary to treat emphysema, cancer or dennatological disorders in mammals (preferably, humans) using the pharmacokinetic parameters determined by the above procedures in conjunction with animal model dosage data.<br>
Dosage amounts and intervals may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of a compound of the invention which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic effect. Usual patient dosages for administration by injection range from 0.1 jig and about 10.0 mg, preferably, between about 1.0 \ig and about 1.0 mg, more preferably, between about 100.0 |ig and about 300.0 pg. Therapeutically effective serum levels may be achieved by administering a single daily dose or multiple doses each day.<br>
The amount of a compound of the invention administered will, of course, be dependent on, among other factors, the subject being treated, the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, the dosage may be delivered in a pharmaceutical composition by a single administration, by multiple applications or controlled release. Dosing may be repeated intermittently, may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs and will continue as long as required for effective treatment of emphysema.<br>
Preferably, a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of the invention described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of compounds of the invention may be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures and may be readily ascertained by the skilled artisan. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index. A compound of the invention will preferably exhibit particularly high therapeutic indices in treating emphysema, cancer or dennatological disorders when compared to other retinoid agonists. The dosage of a compound of the inventions described herein will preferably be within a range of circulating concentrations that include the effective dose with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see, e.g., Fingl et aL, 1975, In: The Pharmacological Basis ofTherapeutics, Ch.l,<br><br>
p.l). For example, a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of the invention may be administered either orally or directly into the lung.<br>
The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples describing in detail the preparation of the compound and compositions of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 10: MEASUREMENT OF ALVEOLAR REPAIR IN RAT LUNG WITH A COMPOUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of the invention may be evaluated for their effects on alveolar repair in the rat model of elastase-induced emphysema (Massaro et aL9 Nature, 1997, Vol. 3, No. 6:675; Massaro et aL, United States Patent No. 5,998,486). Preferably, animals are divided into treatment groups of approximately eight Lung inflammation and alveolar damage may be induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by a single instillation of about 2 U/gram body mass of pancreatic elastase (porcine derived, Calbiochem).<br>
Animals may be treated with a compound of the invention prepared in Capmul at convenient oral dosage ranges (preferably, between about 10.0 mgfkg and 0.0001 mg/kg) and will be dosed orally once per day starting 21 days post injury. Control groups are challenged with elastase and 21 days later are treated with vehicle (Capmul solution) for 14 days. Animals are sacrificed 24 hours after the last dose by exsanguination under deep anesthesia. Blood was collected at time of exsanguination for analysis.<br>
The lungs are inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin by intratracheal instillation at a constant rate (1 ml/gram body mass/min). The lung is excised and immersed in fixative for 24 hours prior to processing. Alveolar measurements are made in four regions of the lung/rat The mean value/treatment group may be determined by summing the average area/rat for all eight rats relative to the elastase* vehicle treated group. In some cases, the variability between rats within a treatment group was too large for the group average to be statistically significant Standard methods may be used to prepare 5 jim paraffin sections. Sections are stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Computerized Moiphometric analysis was performed to determine the average alveolar size and alveolar number.<br>
Quantitation of triglycerides contained in rat plasma may be performed using established procedures. Briefly, plasma triglycerides may be converted to dihdroxyacetone and hydrogen peroxide by sequential treatment of plasma with lipase and glycerokinase according directions described by the manufacturer of triglycerides/GPO kit (Boehringer Mannheim #1488872). Hydrogen peroxide may be quantitated colorimetrically in a Hitachi 911 Chemistry Analyzer. In rats normal triglyceride levels are between about 75 mg/dl and about 175 mg/dL Triglyceride values are a convenient measure of toxicity.<br><br>
