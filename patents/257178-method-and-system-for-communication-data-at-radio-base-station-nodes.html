				<td>2 DIFFERENT CARRIER PROTOCOLS AT RADIO<br>
BASE STATION NODES FOR RESPECTIVELY DATA<br>
COMMUNICATION TO A MOBILE SWITCHING CENTER<br>
AND OTHER RADIO BASE STATION NODES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is related to U.S. Application Serial No. 10/011,669 (Attorney Docket No. 8194-573) entitled "METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR COMMUNICATING DATA AT RADIO BASE STATION NODES THAT PROVIDE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF CONTROL CHANNELS" and filed concurrently herewith. The disclosure of U.S. Application Serial No. 10/011,669 (Attorney Docket No. 8194-573) is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of communications and more particularly to radio communications.<br>
In conventional radio telephone communications systems, control, voice, and data information from a mobile switching center is received at a radio base station via a carrier protocol such as a T1, E1, or J1 carrier protocol. Each carrier protocol can support a fixed number of channels or timeslots for communicating control, voice, and data information between the mobile switching center and a radio base station. Within a radio base station, the control, voice, and data information from the mobile switching center is received at a control board interface, and portions of this data can be communicated with other base station control boards and/or other base station devices using a bus interface of the same type as that used for the carrier from the mobile switching center.<br>
For example, a conventional radio base station that communicates with a mobile switching center using the T1 carrier protocol generally will also use the T1 carrier protocol for the bus interface between control boards. The<br>
carrier protocol used to support communications between a mobile switching center and a radio base station may be dictated by commercial availability, and conventional base stations generally use this same protocol for the internal bus interface. In the United States, for example, T1 lines are generally commercially available and are thus generally used to couple radio base stations and mobile switching centers. Accordingly, the T1 carrier . protocol is used for radio base station internal buses as all control board interfaces support the same carrier protocol.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to embodiments of the present invention, systems and methods.are provided for communicating data at radio base station nodes. Carrier data can be communicated between a carrier interface of a first radio base station node and a mobile switching center over a carrier bus according to a carrier protocol. In addition, bus data can be communicated between a bus interface of the first radio base station node and a second radio base station node over a radio base station bus according to a radio base station protocol that is different from the carrier protocol.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating radio base station nodes and<br>
methods according to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Figure'2 is a block-diagram illustrating a radio communications systems<br>
and methods according to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a radio base station of a radiotelephone communications system can include a radio base station node 321 with carrier interfaces (CI) 323 and 325, bus interfaces (Bl) 327 and 329, and transceiver interface (Tl) 331. As shown, each carrier interface can be used to communicate carrier data with the mobile switching center (MSC) 341 over respective carrier buses, and each bus interface can be used to communicate bus data with other radio base station nodes over a radio base station bus. In addition, transceiver data for the transceiver 333 can be communicated between the radio base station node 321 and the transceiver 333 through the transceiver interface 331. Accordingly, the radio base station node 321 can support wireless communications with one or more user terminals through transceiver 333 and the mobile switching center 341, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 343, and/or another radio base station node.<br>
Carrier data can be communicated between one or more carrier interfaces 323 and 325 of the radio base station node 321 and the mobile switching center 341 according to a carrier protocol, and bus data can be communicated between one or more bus interfaces 327 and 329 of the radio base station node 321 and one or more other radio base station nodes according to a radio base station protocol that is different than the carrier protocol. For example, each carrier bus between the base station node and the mobile switching center can be operated according to one of the T1 protocol (standard in the U.S.), the J1 protocol (standard in Japan), and the E1 protocol (standard in Europe), and each radio base station bus can be operated according to another of the T1, J1, and E1 protocols. Moreover, carrier interfaces 323 and 325 may operate according to different protocols and bus interfaces 327 and 329 can operate according to different protocols. In other words, the protocol for each interface can be selected independently.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, each carrier bus can be operated according to the T1 protocol using leased T1 lines which are commercially available in the United States," and  the internal radio base station bus can be internally provided by the radio telephone communications system and operated at a higher data rate protocol such as the E1 or J1 protocols. In the United States, for example, T1 lines are commonly leased to provide the carrier bus(es) between a mobile switching center and radio base<br>
stations of a radiotelephone communications system. Radio base station buses interconnecting radio base station nodes, however, are generally internal to the radiotelephone communications system and thus need not rely on a protocol dictated by providers of leased lines.<br>
More particularly, carrier data communicated between the radio base station node 321 and the mobile switching center 341 over one or more carrier buses can include control data such as operation and maintenance ("O&amp;M") data for the radio base station node 321 and other radio base station nodes coupled to the bus interfaces 327 and 329. The carrier data can also include user payload data for communications with user terminals.<br>
User payload data communicated over the carrier buses can be used to support communications with user terminals through the transceiver 333 coupled to the radio base station node 321 and/or to support communications with user terminals through transceivers coupled to other radio base station . nodes coupled to the bus interfaces 327 and 329 through the radio base station buses. For example, user payload data can be used to support voice or internet communications with a user terminal.<br>
User payload data communicated between the radio base station node 321 and the mobile switching center 341 through the carrier interfaces 323 and 325 supporting communications through transceiver 333 does not necessarily communicate over the radio base station buses from bus interfaces 327 and 329. User payload data communicated between the radio base station node 321 and the mobile switching center 341 through the carrier interfaces 323 and 325 supporting communications through transceivers associated with other radio base station nodes can be communicated to the other radio bases station nodes over the radio base station buses using bus interfaces 327 and 329.<br>
The control data communicated between the radio base station node 321 and the mobile switching center 341 over one or more carrier buses can include operation and maintenance ("O&amp;M") data for the radio base station node 321 and other radio base station nodes coupled to the bus interfaces 327 and 329 as discussed above. The control data can also include messaging data such as short message service (SMS) data and/or pages for user terminals serviced by the transceiver 333 or other transceivers<br>
associated with other radio base station nodes coupled to the radio base station buses. According to aspects of the present invention, all control data communicated over the carrier buses can be communicated over the radio base station buses whether the control data is for use by the radio base station node 321 or for use by another radio base station node coupled to the radio base station buses.<br>
While the radio base station node 321 of Figure 1 is illustrated with two carrier interfaces 323 and 325 each coupled to the mobile switching center 341 via respective carrier buses, a radio base station node according to the present invention can include only a single carrier interface or can include three or more carrier interfaces. Moreover, a radio base station-node according to the present invention can include unused carrier interfaces that are not coupled to the mobile switching center. A radio base station node according to the present invention, for example, may include two carrier interfaces, one of which may be unused if the additional capacity is not required for the application for which it is being used. A radio base station node in a relatively high traffic base station may require coupling of ail carrier interfaces, while a radio base station node in a lower traffic base station may not have carrier buses coupled to all carrier interfaces.<br>
The radio base station node 321 may also support more than one transceiver. Alternatively, a radio base station node according to the present invention may not have any transceivers coupled thereto. A radio base station node, for example, may be used to provide additional capacity and/or redundancy with respect to carrier buses to the mobile switching center without requiring coupling of a transceiver directly thereto. In a radio telephone communications system with sufficient transceivers, an additional radio base station node could be added into a radio base station bus to provide additional buses to the mobile switching center without adding an additional transceiver.<br>
The radio base station node'321"ca"n be provided on a single control " board and/or circuit. Alternatively, the functionality of the radio base station node can be, provided on multiple boards and/or circuits. In addition, a board and/or circuit providing functionality of the radio base station node can provide additional functionality.<br>
Radio base station nodes according to embodiments of the present invention can support use of different bus protocols over the carrier bus and the radio base station bus by using separate Framers and Field Programmable Gate Arrays at each of the carrier interfaces 323 and 325 and at each of the bus interfaces 327 and 329. Accordingly, each interface type can be defined independently. With applications in the United States, for example, the carrier interfaces 323 and 325 can be defined to support 24 PCM timeslots per frame according to the T1 protocol thereby allowing use of commercially available T1 lines to provide carrier buses. The bus interfaces 327 and 329 of the same radio base station node can be defined to support a higher data rate of 32 PCM timeslots per frame according to the E1 protocol over the radio base station bus which is internal to the radio telephone communications system. A number of timeslots available for passing voice and data traffic between radio base station nodes can thus be increased.<br>
A radio telephone communications system including a plurality of radio base station nodes 21,121, and 221 is illustrated in Figure 2. As shown, each radio base station node 21,121, and 221 can be associated with a respective transceiver 33,133, and 233 or group of transceivers to provide wireless communications with respective user terminals 35,135, and 235. While a single user terminal is shown in communication with each transceiver, it will be.understood that each transceiver may provide communications with a plurality of user terminals and that there may be times when a transceiver is not providing communications with any user terminals. In the example of Figure 2, each transceiver or group of transceivers may be used to provide service over a 120 degree sector of a single radio base station so that each of the illustrated transceivers and radio base station nodes is part of a single 3-sector base station. Alternatively, one or more of the radio base station nodes and transceivers may be part of a separate base station. In addition, the radio base station bus can be used to couple any number of radio base station nodes other than three. A system according to the'present invention may also include additional radio base station nodes defining separate radio base station buses. While a single transceiver is illustrated as being coupled to each node through a transceiver interface to provide service over a sector, a<br>
group of transceivers can be coupled to a radio base station node to provide service over a sector.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, each radio base station node coupled by the radio base station bus can be coupled to no carrier buses (radio base station node 221), coupled to a single carrier bus (radio base station node 21), or coupled to more than one carrier bus (radio base station node 121) according to levels of capacity and/or redundancy desired for each radio base station node. As discussed above, the mobile switching center 41 can communicate control and user payload information over each of the carrier buses with the carrier interface 23 of radio base station node 21 and the carrier interfaces 123 and 125 of radio base station node 131. Control data communicated over a carrier bus at either, radio base station node 21 or 121 can be communicated over the radio base station bus with each of the radio base station nodes so that all radio base station nodes on the radio base station bus receive all control data.<br>
Not all user payload data, however, is necessarily communicated over the radio base station bus. User payload data communicated using carrier interface 23 to support communications with user terminal 35 using transceiver 33, for example, is not required to be communicated over the radio base station bus thereby preserving bandwidth on the radio base station bus.   User payload data communicated using carrier interface 23 to support communications with user terminal 235 using transceiver 233, for example, can be communicated over the radio base station bus. using bus interface 29 and bus interface 229. Alternatively, user payload data communicated using carrier interface 23 to support communications with user terminal 235 using transceiver 233 can be communicated over the radio base station bus using bus interface 27, radio base station node 121 and bus interface 227.<br>
Redundancy can thus be provided in the radio base station bus in that there are multiple paths from any radio base station node on the bus to any other base station node on the bus. Accordingly,a disconnection of any single leg of the radio base station bus of Figure 2 need not prevent communication between any of the three radio base station nodes on the radio base station bus. Redundancy can also be provided in that disconnection of any one of the carrier buses need not prevent all<br>
communication between any radio base station nodes and the mobile switching center 41. If the carrier bus connected to the carrier interface 23 is disconnected, for example, control and user payload data can still be received at the radio base station node 21. through the radio base station node 121 and the radio base station bus.<br>
As shown in the embodiments of Figure 2, a radio base station bus can include three legs in a bus linking three radio base station nodes. As shown, the radio base station bus can include a first leg between bus interface 27 of radio base station node 21 and bus interface 127 of radio base station node 121, a second leg between bus interface 29 of radio base station.node 21 and bus interface 229 of radio base station node 221, and a third Jeg between bus interface 129 of radio base station node 121 and bus interface 227 of radio base station node 221. Additional nodes could be provided with corresponding additional legs of the radio base station bus.<br>
According to aspects of the present invention, the radio base station bus, coupling bus interfaces 27,127,129, 227, 229, and 29, can be used to communicate data according to a radio base station protocol that is different than a carrier protocol used to communicate data over carrier buses between the mobile switching center 41 and the carrier interfaces 23,123, and 125. The carrier protocol can be a protocol supported by commercially available data lines, such as T1 lines, used to couple mobile switching centers with radio base stations, while the radio base station protocol can be a higher data rate protocol such as the E1 or J1 protocol.<br>
By providing a higher data rate on the radio base station bus, a higher level of redundancy can be provided in the system.. If communication between carrier interface 23 of radio base station node 21 and the mobile switching center 41 is interrupted, for example, a higher data rate radio base station bus can provide a lesser restriction on the redundant data path from the mobile switching center 41 through radio base station node 121 and the radio base station bus to the'radio "base station node 21. Performance, degradations resulting from interruption of one or more data paths in a radio telephone communications system can thus be reduced. In addition, higher levels of performance may be achieved for radio base station nodes, such as node 221, which are not directly coupled with the mobile switching center 41.<br>
