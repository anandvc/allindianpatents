				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
INTERLABIAL PAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an interlabial pad that is able to be worn<br>
by female wearer, being placed in an intimate contact between the labia.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a sanitary napkin and a tampon are used generally as a<br>
female sanitary products. Here, there have been great efforts to prevent the<br>
leak of menstrual blood from gap caused by a poor contact state near the<br>
ostium vaginae as for the sanitary napkin. Moreover, as for the tampon, there<br>
have been great efforts for relieving a foreign feeling and discomfort when<br>
wearing a tampon product and intervaginal wearing trouble due to the nature of<br>
those products.<br>
Under such situation, a sanitary product of the interlabial pad have<br>
attracted people as a sanitary product positioned between the sanitary napkin<br>
and the tampon in recent years. The interlabial pad is used by inserting its<br>
portion between the labia and bringing into contact with a labia inner face, it<br>
prevents the menstrual blood from leaking since it has higher adhesion to the<br>
body than that of the sanitary napkin, and the menstrual blood from being<br>
diffused and brought widely into contact with the body, so it is sanitary and clean.<br>
Moreover, the interlabial pad which has characteristics that it excels in a wear<br>
feeling, is comfortable because of being smaller than the sanitary napkin, and<br>
has lower psychological resistance on wearing than that of the tampon which is<br>
inserted into the vagina.<br>
Unlike a sanitary napkins being fixed to an underwear or a tampon and<br>
being fixed by insertion into the vagina, the interlabial pad is usually used and<br>
fixed to the body by inserting it between the labia, which may make right and left<br>
phase shifts in body motions. Therefore, it is necessary that the interlabial pad<br>
can make right and left phase shifts flexibly to follow the wearer's body motions.<br>
That is, it is required to the motions of the labia corresponding to the<br>
asymmetric body motions with respect to the body's longitudinal plane of<br>
symmetry, which extends along the anteroposterior axis, like putting one foot in<br>
front of the other alternately in walking. If the interlabial pad cannot follow the<br>
body motions and falls from the wearer's interlabial space, the resulting leak of<br>
menstrual blood is a significant problem. The "right and left phase shifts" refer to<br>
a broad concept including asymmetric or separate changes of the right and left<br>
sides (The change includes changing positions and moving.).<br>
As a conventional example of such device, an absorbent interlabial<br>
device is disclosed (Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-506168). The<br>
absorbent interlabial device comprises a liquid permeable topsheet, a liquid non<br>
permeable backsheet and an absorbent core positioned between the topsheet<br>
and backsheet. The length of the absorbent interlabial device is greater than<br>
about 60 mm and less than about 130 mm. The width of the device is between<br>
about 25 mm and about 50 mm.. The device comprises an axis of preferred<br>
bending, located along the longitudinal centerline of the device. When the<br>
device is folded along this axis and is inserted into the wearer's interlabial space,<br>
the topsheet maintains contact with the walls of the wearer's labia.<br>
When being inserted between the labia, the absorbent interlabial device<br>
is folded to be accommodated in the space. However, unlike a usual sanitary<br>
napkin, the interlabial pad is not fixed to the underwear or not fixed by insertion<br>
like a tampon. The interlabial pad is inserted between ihe labia in such condition<br>
that the pad may slip or shift and is not fixed as securely as the sanitary napkin<br>
or tampon. Therefore, with the wearer's body movement, slips between the<br>
absorbent interlabial device (equivalent to the interlabial pad) and the labia may<br>
tend to occur, which may make the wearer feel discomfort.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to solve problems pointed out above.<br>
The object of the invention is, with the interlabial pad placed in intimate contact<br>
with and supported between labia, to reduce discomfort as much as possible<br>
which the wearer of the pad feels when some force is exerted on either the<br>
interlabial pad or the labia by the body motions.<br>
The inventors found out that it might be the slip between the interlabial<br>
pad and inner walls of the labia or some force felt between the interiabial pad<br>
and the inner walls of the labia, even without any slips, which makes the wearer<br>
feel discomfort. Such force is apt to be produced by the wearer's asymmetric<br>
motions. For example, as for an interlabial pad which is worn by being folded,<br>
the left labium is to contact the left side of the interlabial pad and the right<br>
labium is to contact the right side of the interlabial pad. If the interlabial pad had<br>
enough flexibility, problems pointed above would not arise. Because the right<br>
and left sides of the folding line of the interlabial pad could make right and left<br>
phase shifts to some extent. However, in some cases, the friction between the<br>
back side sheet and itself contacting each other being caused by the right and<br>
left phase shifts in body motion makes it difficult to maintain the wearing position.<br>
For example, when an asymmetric motion, such as walking movement of the<br>
wearer, is made, the surfaces of the right and left sides of the interlabial pad<br>
contacting right and left labia, respectively, try to follow the asymmetric<br>
movament. However, the frictional force arising from the back side sheet<br>
makes it difficult for the right and left sides of the interlabial pad to make right<br>
and left phase shifts with respect to the folding line. This does not only cause a<br>
feeling of discomfort to the wearer but also results in that either or both surfaces<br>
of the right and left sides of the interlabial pad contacting left and right labia<br>
surfaces, respectively, come off from the labium. Consequently, the pad falls off<br>
the labia because its holding force is lost.<br>
Additionally, when the frictional force between the back side sheet and<br>
the underwear becomes greater than the holding force of the labia to hold the<br>
interlabial pad, the pad can not follow the wearer's body motion, which not only<br>
causes a feeling of discomfort to the wearer but also raise the strong possibility<br>
that the interlabial pad may fall off the labia. Thus, achieving low friction<br>
between the back side sheet and itself, or between the back side sheet and<br>
another thing such as underwear, is clearly preferable. The inventors also found<br>
out that low friction could be achieved easily and effectively by contriving the<br>
surface shape of the back side sheet.<br>
The present invention is developed based on the above-mentioned<br>
findings and provides an interlabial pad being fixed to labia in intimate contact<br>
with a structure and/or shape which allows flexible, asymmetric movements<br>
even when a shearing force is exerted on the interlabial pad by body motion, i.e.,<br>
a structure and/or shape which achieves low friction.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides the following:<br>
(1) An interlabial pad having a size, a weight and flexibility so as to be<br>
pinched and held partially or totally in between the labia without forcing, the pad<br>
comprising: a body side face orientated toward a body side, and an opposite<br>
side face to the body side face orientated toward a garment side and; wherein<br>
said opposite side face to the body side face has a surface shape ("low friction<br>
shape") of low resisting force by sliding with another face, which includes a<br>
same face.<br>
"Partially or totally" may mean that a part or the whole of the interlabial<br>
pad is to be unseen by inserting the interlabial pad between labia. To be<br>
pinched without forcing may mean that the wearer who wears the interlabial pad<br>
inserts it between her labia without an unnatural force. To hold may mean that<br>
the pad should not fall from the place where it is inserted. The body side face<br>
oriented to the body side may have at least some portion thereof that is oriented<br>
toward the body side. The opposite body side face to the body side face may<br>
have at least some portion thereof that is oriented to the clothing side is not<br>
necessarily faced the side away from the body.<br>
The "surface shape of the opposite body side face" refers to a shape<br>
which is located on the opposite side face to the body side face or retained by a<br>
member positioned on the opposite side face to the body side face. It is not<br>
necessary that the member or the opposite side face has to retain such shape<br>
over the whole member or the whole surface. But at least a part thereof may<br>
have such surface. "Same face" may mean the same face which is formed on<br>
the opposite side face or by a member located on the opposite side face to the<br>
body side and which is located at different places on the opposite side face. For<br>
example, the same face may refer to a different face (part) located on the same<br>
face of the part which comes into contact with the face by bending the surface.<br>
"Another face" may include the same face mentioned above and surfaces of a<br>
different member, e.g., a surface formed on a clothing such as underwear.<br>
"A surface shape of low resisting force by sliding ("low friction shape")"<br>
means a surface shape, that is, a low resistance shape when sliding with the<br>
same type of surface or a predetermined surface under a predetermined<br>
condition. And it is a shape other than surfaces having engaging portions such<br>
as a hook and loop (for example, MAGIC TAPE (Japanese registered trade<br>
mark)).<br>
(2) The interlabial pad according to (1), wherein said low friction shape<br>
comprises a shape having a substantially small contact area between sliding<br>
two faces.<br>
Here, "sliding two faces" may comprise one face referring to a face on the<br>
opposite side face to the body side face and the other face referring to a face<br>
located at other place on the same opposite side face or another face on a<br>
clothing or the like. The Substantial contact area may refer to the total area of<br>
portions, which actually contact each other, of the two surfaces that appear to<br>
contact each other. "Contact" may include contact via solid material or viscous<br>
fluid and may mean the state where one surface transmits a friction force to the<br>
other mating surface by sliding. More specifically, the shape having a<br>
substantially small contact area may be a shape of mating faces that have an<br>
actually small contact area.<br>
(3) The interlabial pad according to (1) or (2), wherein said low friction<br>
shape comprises a group of fine convex shapes.<br>
The "fine convex shape" may be a partially projected shape from a<br>
reference surface of the base face on the opposite side face to the body side<br>
face and it may be smaller than that of the base face on the opposite side face<br>
to the body side face. "A group of " may mean that the low friction shape<br>
comprises a plurality of convex shapes since only one convex shape may not<br>
form the low friction shape.<br>
(4) The interlabial pad according to (3), wherein said fine convex<br>
shape is an emboss portion processed by an emboss former.<br>
The "emboss portion processed" refers to a part which protrudes from<br>
the reference surface of the base face of the opposite side face to the body side<br>
face and particularly, to a part having a protrusion small enough in comparison<br>
to the base face of the opposite side face to the body side face. Seen from the<br>
above, a shape of the emboss portion protruding upward is usually a circle.<br>
However, the shape may be a rectangle, an ellipse or other shapes so that it is<br>
not limited to a circle.<br>
(5) The interlabial pad according to (4), wherein an emboss rate of said<br>
fine convex shape is at least 1% and not exceeding 50%.<br>
The "emboss rate" is determined by dividing the total area of emboss<br>
portions by the total area on the opposite side face to the body side face which<br>
can be processed by the emboss former.<br>
(6) The interlabial pad according to (1) or (2), wherein said low friction<br>
shape is made of a fiber assembly.<br>
The "fiber assembly " refers to plural fibers which are gathered to form a<br>
cluster. The fiber assembly includes woven fabrics and nonwoven fabrics.<br>
(7) The interlabial pad according to (6), wherein said fiber assembly is<br>
made of nonwoven fabric.<br>
The "nonwoven fabric" may refer to fabrics except woven fabrics and<br>
may include fabrics made by spun bonding, spun lacing, through air, needle<br>
punching and other methods.<br>
(8) The interlabial pad according to any one from (1) to (7), wherein<br>
said opposite side face to the body side face is made of a low friction material.<br>
The "low friction material" refers to materials including an inorganic<br>
material and an organic material such as polymers of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br>
and materials having a small frictional coefficient in a dry condition, materials<br>
having a low friction against fabrics including cloth made of fibers, nonwoven<br>
fabric, etc., materials having a low friction against themselves. The "small<br>
frictional coefficient" refers to a value of 0.3 or less, and more preferably, 0.1 or<br>
less.<br>
(9) The interlabial pad according to any one from (1) to (8), wherein<br>
a lubricant is applied to said opposite side face to the body side face.<br>
The lubricant refers to lubricants including solid lubricants, such as<br>
smooth powder, and fluid lubricants, such as silicone oil, which have particularly<br>
low toxicity and no health and sanitary problems.<br>
(10) The interlabial pad according to any one from (1) to (9), wherein<br>
said interlabial pad comprises a mini sheet piece.<br>
The "mini sheet piece" may refer to an attachment to the outside of said<br>
interlabial pad and may form a sac or bridge together v/ith the interlabial pad.<br>
(11) The interlabial pad according to any one from (1) to (10), wherein<br>
said interlabial pad is an interlabial pad for an incontinence.<br>
According to the interlabial pad of the present invention, the pad can be<br>
used for incontinence absorbing pad. As ostium vaginae where the menstrual<br>
blood is discharged and a urethral meatus where urine is discharged are<br>
located between labia, and the interlabial pad of the invention to be used<br>
between the labia can absorb urine also.<br>
As described hereinbefore, the pad of the invention can absorb urine<br>
between the labia, especially around the urethral meatus and is useful for the<br>
absorbing pad for incontinence, especially for a light incontinence.<br>
(12) The interlabial pad according to any one from (1) to (10), wherein<br>
said interlabial pad is an interlabial pad for absorbing vaginal discharge.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the interlabial pad can be used<br>
for a pad of absorbing the vaginal discharge. The interlabial pad according to<br>
the present invention is used between the labia and can absorb the excretion<br>
other than the menstrual blood from the ostium vaginae for the use therefore<br>
(for absorbing the vaginal discharge).<br>
As described above, the pad can absorb the vaginal discharge in order to<br>
decrease the discomfort for the wearer, and is useful for the wearer who is not<br>
menstruating.<br>
(13) A method for reducing a foreign feeling of an interlabial pad wearer<br>
by using the interlabial pad of any one from (1) to (12).<br>
With this method complaints of the interlabial pad wearer who wears an<br>
analogous but different interlabial pad and claims feelings of discomfort are<br>
resolved.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Next, the embodiments of the interlabial pad according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the figures.<br>
[Basic interlabial pad]<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic plan view of an interlabial pad 10. An interlabial<br>
pad essentially has a shape which is elongated longitudinally, that is, an<br>
elliptical shape having the major axis from front 14 to rear 16 along the<br>
longitudinal axis (X-axis), and the minor axis from right 18 to left 20 on the<br>
lateral axis (Y-axis). However, the shape of the product is not necessarily limited<br>
to it, but it may be any one of the shapes which are suitable for the labial area<br>
and allow right and left phase shifts during use, such as an elliptical shape, an<br>
ovoid shape, a gourd shape and a tear drop shape.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic cross-sectional view taken along line X1-X2 of<br>
Fig. 1. The interlabial pad 10 comprises a liquid permeable surface side sheet<br>
26 of the wearer's body side face 22 facing inner walls of labia; a permeable or<br>
non permeable back side sheet 30 facing the opposite side face 24 to the body<br>
side face, that is, the wearer's clothing side; and an absorber 28. The interlabial<br>
pad 10 is an over-laid type pad, whose surface side sheet and back side sheet<br>
are bonded together at the outer edge of the absorbent. The surface side sheet<br>
26 and the back side sheet 30 may be bonded by heat seal alone or in<br>
combination with a hot melt type adhesive. The interlabial pad 10 is not limited<br>
to the above-mentioned overlaid type structure, but may be an enclosing type<br>
structure composed of an absorber, and a water impermeable material<br>
positioned under an absorber, and a water permeable sheet covers the<br>
absorber and the water impermeable material entirely.<br>
Next, a brief description of the surface side sheet and the absorber,<br>
which are main components of the interlabial pad will be given. A description of<br>
the back side sheet will be given later in relation to low friction characteristics.<br>
[Surface side sheet (water permeable sheet)]<br>
It is preferable that the surface side sheet of the interlabial pad positioned<br>
at the body side is water permeable as described above. For the water<br>
permeable sheet, materials which are hydrophilic to liquid and non-irritant to the<br>
skin are used. By way of example, the following materials may be given: a<br>
nonwoven fabric or a combination thereof made with a melt blown method, a<br>
spun bond method, a point bond method, a through-air method, a needle punch<br>
method, a wet-type spun lace method, a foam film method, and so on.<br>
Examples of fibrous sheets include sheeted fabrics which are any single<br>
or mixture of fibers made of rayon, acetate, cotton, pulp or synthetic resin, alone<br>
or a combination thereof so as to form a core- and-sheath structure.<br>
Among the materials, considering the liquid mobility from the inner face of<br>
the labia, chemical stimulation by an activator, and contact state with the inner<br>
wall of the labia, it is preferable to apply spun-lace nonwoven fabric. It is<br>
prepared by the following procedures: Rayon with 1.1 to 4.4 dtex fineness and 7<br>
to 51 mm fiber length is spread as a layer to have 40 to 80 % of a specific<br>
weight per unit area to the total on the body face side. Mixtures of rayon with<br>
1.1 to 4.4 dtex fineness and 7 to 51 mm fiber length and 14 to 42 % of a specific<br>
weight per unit area to the total and PET with 1.1 to 4.4 dtex fineness and 7 to<br>
51 mm fiber length and 6 to 18 % of a specific weight per unit area to the total<br>
are spread as a layer on the garment face side. After laminating the two layers<br>
so as to make 20 to 60 g/m2 of the total weight per unit area, the fibers are<br>
entangled by water-flow interlacing treatment and then dried to make spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric with the thickness of 0.13 to 0.50 mm. During the above<br>
procedures, by mixing PET on the garment side face, bulkiness can be easily<br>
maintained even if the permeable sheet becomes wet. Therefore, the contact<br>
state between inner walls of the labia can be maintained.<br><absorber><br>
For the absorber contained in the interlabial pad, materials such as pulp,<br>
chemical pulp, rayon, acetate, natural cotton, super absorbent polymer, super<br>
absorbent polymer fiber and synthetic fiber, can be used independently or in a<br>
combination thereof. Mixtures of required compositions are formed into the<br>
absorber by known techniques such as pressing by an emboss former and<br>
entangling by needling, and as required, can be prepared by appropriately<br>
adjusting bulkiness, layering, folding or the like.<br>
Sheet materials may be used after processed into sheets or powder, not<br>
being limited by the its application.<br>
It is preferable for the absorber, although any material can be used as<br>
long as it is capable of absorbing and holding liquid (fluid), to be bulky,<br>
hard-to-be deformed, less chemically stimulant, and more preferably highly<br>
flexible to fit into the labia. Specifically, 50 to 150 g/m2 of pulp with lengths<br>
thereof selected from the range of the fiber length of 1 to 10 mm is laminated on<br>
the garment side face. On the body side face, 150 to 250 g/m2 of a mixture<br>
obtained by mixing 60 to 90 % of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4 dtex fineness and 20 to<br>
51 mm fiber length and 40 to 10 % of natural cotton is laminated. The two<br>
laminated layers are formed into a sheet by a dotted emboss processor to have<br>
2 to 10 mm bulkiness, and more preferable to have 3 to 5 mm bulkiness.<br>
Thereby, liquid can be easily transmitted from the body side face to the garment<br>
side face resulting in the improvement of the absorbing and holding capacity.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a mesh spun lace nonwoven fabric of rayon with 1.1<br>
to 4.4 dtex fineness and 25 to 51 mm fiber length and a specific weight per unit<br>
area of 15 to 40 g/m2, the liquid transmitted from the body side face can be<br>
dispersed by the mesh spun lace to be induced to almost all over the region of<br>
the pulp layer. Therefore, more liquid can be effectively absorbed.<br>
The interlabial pad 10 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 may be used being folded<br>
along the line from front 14 to rear 16 along the X-axis as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Then, the surface side sheet 26 on the body side face 22 is facing the upper<br>
side (or outside). On the other hand, the opposite body side face 24 is facing<br>
the lower side and the back side sheet 30 is facing inside of the folded pad. In<br>
such structure, the surface side sheet 26 contacts the surface of the labia and<br>
the right and left sides of the pad contact the right and left sides of the labia<br>
respectively. Therefore, when the right and left sides of the labia move<br>
asymmetrically, the right and left sides of the interlabial pad can move to follow<br>
such movement of the right and left sides of the labia to some extent. That is,<br>
a sheet-like member can easily foliow relatively the right and left phase shifts of<br>
the interlabial pad caused by body motions. In this case, however, the folded<br>
back side sheet slide against each other so that an object of the present<br>
invention is to reduce the friction produced under these conditions.<br>
[Back side sheet]<br><water impermeability><br>
As the materials for the water impermeable sheet which can be used for<br>
the back side sheet of the interlabial pad, materials which can prevent the<br>
menstrual blood contained in the absorber from leaking out of the interlabial pad<br>
can be used. Using the moisture-permeable materials may reduce the stuffy<br>
feeling so as to reduce the discomfort during use.<br>
Examples of such materials include sheet films made of synthetic resins<br>
which are formed into membranes, breathing films made by drawing synthetic<br>
resin combined with inorganic fillers, laminated materials made by combining<br>
paper, nonwoven fabrics and films, and a gas-permeable and water<br>
non-permeable sheet having 10-30% of open pores and 0.1 to 0.6 mm diameter<br>
with capillaries disposed to extend toward the absorber.<br>
Additionally, in considering flexibility so as not to degrade the wear<br>
feeling in use, a film having a weight per unit area of 15 to 30 g/m2 and mainly<br>
comprising low density polyethylene (LDPE) resin which has a density of 0.900<br>
to 0.925 g/cm3 can be used as a preferred example. However, the combination<br>
or composition of the materials may vary to have the following low friction<br>
characteristics.<br><low friction characteristics><br>
On the garment side face of the back side sheet of the interlabial pad<br>
according to the present invention, the back side face has a surface structure<br>
hard to make an intimate contact with each other so as to reduce the friction<br>
force of the back side sheet against itself such that the interlabial pad can make<br>
right and left phase shifts easily. More concretely, reducing the ratio of contact<br>
area between top surfaces on one place and another place of the back side<br>
sheet may make it more difficult to make an intimate contact of mated surfaces.<br>
By way of example, it is also possible to make it less likely to make an intimate<br>
contact between the back side sheet and itself by applying lubricants such as<br>
silicone oil, polyhydric alcohol including glyceline and ethyleneglycol, paraffin<br>
wax and paraffin oil so that the back side sheet and itself are in contact under<br>
the presence of lubricants.<br>
[Combined type of laminated fiber]<br>
Fig. 4 shows a front view seen from the bottom of the back side sheet 32<br>
made of a laminated fiber composite in a first embodiment. The unevenness<br>
formed by a laminated fiber composite 34 (Fig. 5) reduces the contact area at<br>
and between the top surface and itself of the folded back side sheet,<br>
consequently, reducing the close contact. Therefore, low friction will be<br>
achieved. As shown in Fig. 5, which is a cross-sectional view taken along line<br>
A-A of Fig.4, the back side sheet 32 combined with the laminated fiber<br>
composite 34 was considered to tend to have high degree of stiffness, however,<br>
it is possible to give enough flexibility to the back side sheet by thinning a<br>
synthetic resin film into a resin film thin membrane or selecting an appropriate<br>
bonding method, therefore, the back side sheet 32 is suitable for the interlabial<br>
pad 10.<br>
Particularly, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, a spun bond nonwoven<br>
fabric 36 is used as a fiber cluster forming the laminated fiber composite 34. A<br>
film 38 is made of polystyrene resin film 38.<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram showing surfaces of one place and another<br>
of the back side sheet in contact with each other. As shown in Fig. 6, the<br>
surfaces not only have a small contact area but also gaps 40 are produced,<br>
therefore the moisture does not stay on the contact surface of the back side<br>
sheet even when the back side sheet becomes damp. Consequently, the friction<br>
will not change noticeably. Therefore, in either dry or wet conditions, the<br>
capability of the right and left sides of interlabial pad to follow the body motion<br>
will not change remarkably, which assures a quality of stability. For the resin<br>
film 38 of the present embodiment, a 22g/m2 film mainly composed of low<br>
density polyethylene having a density of 0.923 g/cm3 and formed into a film by<br>
cast method is used.<br>
As materials other than the above-mentioned films, sheet films made of<br>
synthetic resins such as PP and PET which are formed into membranes can be<br>
used. In considering flexibility so as not to degrade the wear feeling in use, it is<br>
preferable to use a film with a weight per unit area of 5 to 30 g/m2 and mainly<br>
comprising low density polyethylene (LDPE) resin having a density of 0.900 to<br>
0.925 g/cm3. In addition, by drawing polyethylene resin with inorganic fillers<br>
such as calcium carbonate and barium sulfate, gaps are produced in the films to<br>
enhance the flexibility. As gas-permeability is also enhanced by this method, the<br>
hot and muggy feeling will be reduced, which will reduce the discomfort in use.<br>
In the present embodiment, as the laminated fiber composite, a<br>
polypropylene spun bond nonwoven fabric having a weight per unit area of 20<br>
g/m2 and a fineness of 2.2 dtex is used. However, materials used as laminated<br>
fiber composites are not limited to a spun bond nonwoven fabric, but suitable<br>
fibers such as PP, PET, PP/PE, PET/PE (synthetic fibers with core-and-sheath<br>
structure) can be used. The preferred fineness of these fibers is 1.1 dtex to 6.6<br>
dtex, more preferably, 1.7 dtex to 3.3 dtex. These laminated fiber composites<br>
are made by known methods such as spun bonding, spun lace, through air, and<br>
needle punch. The preferred weight per unit area of these laminated fiber<br>
composites is 15 to 50 g/m2, more preferably, 18 to 25 g/m2. Because materials<br>
in these ranges can be provided with gaps in order to reduce the number of<br>
contact points between top surfaces at one place and another place of the back<br>
side sheet in contact with each other, without degrading the flexibility and<br>
drape-feeling.<br>
According to the present invention, the laminated fiber composite and the<br>
film are combined with a lamination method using a hot melt adhesive. However,<br>
the method is not limited to the lamination method, but other methods such as<br>
an extrusion lamination method applying thermoplastic resin to the laminated<br>
fiber composite can also be employed. To prevent the sheet from becoming<br>
stiffer and less flexible through this combining, it is preferable that the film and<br>
the laminated fiber composite are bonded partially. Because this may provide an<br>
interlabial pad with suitable flexibility and drape feeling as appropriate as the<br>
interlabial pad. More specifically, when bonded with a hot melt adhesive, the<br>
adhesive can be applied in dots, stripes, or spirals. When the film and the<br>
laminated fiber composite are bonded with the extension lamination method,<br>
they may be bonded with designed patterns on a chill roll such as a dot pattern<br>
and a rib-groove pattern.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic diagram showing another embodiment using a<br>
laminated fiber composite. In this embodiment, the body side face 22 is the<br>
upper side, and the absorber 28, shown broken in this figure, is positioned on<br>
the side. The film 38 and the laminated fiber composite 42 are the same<br>
materials as used in the previous embodiment. The laminated fiber composite<br>
has protruding parts and recessed parts 46, which reduces the contact area. In<br>
addition, two contact surfaces may be kept a part appropriately because of the<br>
elasticity of the laminated fiber composite, which is considered to be effective<br>
for the reduction in the contact area and friction.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a part of the interlabial pad 10 to which the back side sheet<br>
is applied. The absorber 28 is located between the surface side sheet 26 and<br>
the back side sheet 30 and though connected at the top part, the right and left<br>
parts of the absorber are separated by the back side sheet so that left and right<br>
absorbers can follow the motions of labia contacting the surface side sheet. Fig.<br>
9 shows an enlarged view of B in Fig. 8. As in the case of Fig. 6, a gap 47 is<br>
produced by the recessed parts and protruding parts (46, 44) of the laminated<br>
fiber composite, which stabilizes and reduces the frictional coefficient.<br>
Fig. 10 shows another embodiment. The laminated fiber composite 42 is<br>
also made of the same fiber and film as employed in the first embodiment. The<br>
composite 42 also has protruding portions 44. At the point corresponding to a<br>
recessed part, a melt-bonded zone 49 is made on the film using a hot melt<br>
adhesive. The above combination method may make desired protruding parts<br>
and recessed parts to form a low-friction shape.<br>
[Film Type Processed with Surface Protrusion and Recess]<br>
Fig. 11 is a front view of a back side sheet 50 of a fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The back side sheet 50 includes the reference surface (or<br>
flat surface) 56 of the base member and a protrusion 52. The structure made of<br>
these multiple protruding portions reduces an intimate contact between surfaces<br>
at one place and another of the back side sheet. The resin material and emboss<br>
pattern of the back side sheet 50 can be selected considering the suitable<br>
flexibility for the interlabial pad. Such embodiments can be separated into the<br>
different two cases as shown in (A) and (B) in Fig. 12, (cross-sectional views<br>
taken along line B-B of Fig.11). In (A) of Fig. 12, the back side sheet 50 having<br>
a recess 54 just behind each protrusion 52 is shown, as the protrusion 52 is<br>
made by pressing the film 56 with punch or the like to form the emboss surface,<br>
in (B) of Fig. 12 the back side sheet 50 having a protrusion 52 with a flat<br>
reverse side is shown.<br>
Fig. 13 is a schematic diagram showing a case of the back side sheet<br>
contacting itself. As gaps 58 are produced by the protrusions 52 of the film 56,<br>
even when the back side sheet becomes damp, the moisture does not stay on<br>
the contact surface of the back side sheet. Consequently, the friction will not<br>
change noticeably. The film 56 of the present embodiment is a polyethylene<br>
resin film. However, the material is not limited to this, but sheet films made of<br>
synthetic resins such as PP and PET, which are formed into membranes, can<br>
be used. In considering flexibility so as not to degrade the feel in use, it is<br>
preferable to use a film having a density of 0.900 to 0.925 g/cm3. Filling<br>
inorganic fillers, such as calcium carbonate and barium sulfate, provides the film<br>
with minute pits and projections, which reduce the intimacy of contact. In<br>
addition, by drawing the film, pores may be introduced in the film, which reduce<br>
the stiffness. Also, as gas-permeability is generally obtained by this method, the<br>
hot and muggy feeling will be reduced, which will reduce the discomfort in use.<br>
In the emboss processing of the present embodiment, the protrusion has<br>
a diameter of 0.2 mm at the top, a diameter of 0.6 mm at the bottom, and a<br>
height of 0.12 mm. The dots are placed in a 60° angle staggered arrangement<br>
with a pitch of 1.0 mm (Average embossing rate 5%). The emboss processing<br>
can be carried out in the following range, which is suitable for the interlabial pad.<br>
Preferably, the emboss rate is 1 % to 50 %, and more preferably, 1 % to 30 %.<br>
When the emboss rate is less than 1 %, the emboss processing may produce<br>
no effect as the emboss area is too small to reduce the contact area between<br>
cop surface and itself. On the other hand, when the emboss rate is more than<br>
50 %, not only the contact area between the top surface and itself may increase,<br>
but also the productivity of the emboss processing may be lowered.<br>
A schematic diagram of another embodiment of emboss processing is<br>
shown in (A) of Fig 14. Similarly to Fig. 13, the case that the surfaces of the<br>
folded back side sheet 30 contact each other is described.<br>
As the surfaces of the back side sheet 30, which are facing each other,<br>
come in contact near the top of each embossing portion (protrusion) 52, the<br>
contact area is small and the friction caused by sliding is low. In addition, gaps<br>
are produced between the part other than protrusions 58, which stabilizes the<br>
frictional coefficient as described above. Suppose the back side sheet part 30<br>
shown in the right hand side slightly slides downward, and then upward<br>
pressure shown by an arrow 60 is applied to the right hand side sheet part while<br>
downward pressure shown by an arrow 62 is applied to the left side sheet part,<br>
the contact area is not large as the surfaces contact at the points a iittle below<br>
the top of the protrusions 52. However, the movement of the right and left sheet<br>
parts may cause each protrusion to catch its opposite protrusion, which may<br>
cause friction aside from the contact area. To avoid producing such friction by<br>
catching mechanically, it is recommended to adjust the pitch so that the<br>
protrusion parts may not catch each other in three dimensions. Fig. 15 shows<br>
this in two dimensions as an example. As the emboss portions facing each<br>
other are provided with different pitches, they will not catch each other as<br>
shown in (B) of Fig. 14. Thus, the friction can be reduced as a result of the<br>
reduced contact area.<br><mini sheet piece><br>
Fig. 16 shows one embodiment of the interlabial pad 70 having a mini<br>
sheet piece 80 fixed to a back side sheet in a cross-sectional view.<br>
Similarly to the above-described embodiments, an absorber 28 is<br>
accommodated between the surface side sheet 26 facing the body side face 22<br>
and the back side sheet 30. The mini sheet piece 80 can be attached to the<br>
back side sheet 30 by the means described above, such as hot melt adhesive,<br>
or other means.<br>
The mini sheet piece can be attached to the side of the back side sheet<br>
facing the clothing extending astride both sides of the longitudinal center line,<br>
without interfering the right and left phase shifts of the interlabial pad. When the<br>
interlabial pad is worn by the wearer, the mini sheet piece prevents the close<br>
contact between the surfaces of the folded back side sheet by being placed<br>
between the folded back side sheet of the interlabial pad.<br>
Also, it is preferable that the mini sheet piece is extensible so as not to<br>
interfere the right and left phase shifts of the interlabial pad.<br>
Fig. 17 is a schematic diagram of an interlabial pad 72, to which the mini<br>
sheet piece 80 is attached, according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment, the back side sheet 30 is made of the laminated<br>
fiber composite 36 and a film.<br>
The materials are the same as the embodiments described above. In<br>
this embodiment, the mini sheet piece 80 is placed between the folded back<br>
side sheet 30. As this structure prevents the opposite surfaces of the folded<br>
back side sheet 30 from coming into direct contact with each other and<br>
increases the surface where the shear slide can occur, it is expected that the<br>
friction will be reduced still more.<br>
Fig. 18 is a schematic diagram of an interlabial pad 74, to which the mini<br>
sheet piece 80 is attached according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment, the back side sheet 30 with a plurality of emboss<br>
portions 52 is used.<br>
The materials are the same as the embodiments described above. In this<br>
embodiment, the mini sheet piece 80 is placed between the folded back side<br>
sheet 30. As this structure prevents the opposite surfaces of the folded back<br>
side sheet 30 from coming into direct contact with each other and increases the<br>
surface where the shear slide can occur, it is expected that the friction will be<br>
reduced still more.<br>
Fig. 19 is a schematic diagram of an interlabial pad 76, to which the<br>
mini sheet piece 80 is attached, according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A finger can be inserted into a space 82 surrounded by the<br>
back side sheet 30 and the mini sheet piece 80 to fit the pad.<br>
In this embodiment, as the width of the mini sheet piece (breadthways<br>
length of the interlabial pad) is short, unlike the above-mentioned embodiments,<br>
the mini sheet piece does not necessarily separate folded-and-facing surfaces<br>
of the back side sheet 30 completely. Even in this case, as the back side sheet<br>
30 has low friction shape of the present invention, the friction between the<br>
folded-and-facing surfaces of the back side sheet 30 is low.<br>
Fig. 20 shows a schematic diagram of an interlabial pad 78, being worn,<br>
to which the mini sheet piece 80 is attached, according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The mini sheet piece 80 is projected toward the opposite body side and<br>
does not have a strong influence on the friction. In this interlabial pad 78, the left<br>
side of the surface side sheet 26 contacts the left side of the labia and the right<br>
side of the surface side sheet 26 contacts the right side of the labia.<br>
Therefore, when the left side of labia 90 moves forward (toward this side<br>
from the Fig. 20) and the right side of labia 90 moves backward (toward far side<br>
from the Fig. 20), the left side of the surface side sheet 26 moves forward and<br>
the right side of the labia moves backward, and in response to this movement,<br>
the left side of the absorber 28 moves forward and the right side of absorber 28<br>
moves backward, and then, the left side of the back side sheet 30 moves<br>
forward and the right side of the back side sheet 30 moves backward.<br>
As a result, friction between the folded-and-facing surfaces of the back<br>
side sheet 30 is produced to interfere the above movement. However, as the<br>
back side sheet 30 of the present invention has low friction, the back side sheet<br>
30 slides against the opposite part of the folded back side sheet without<br>
interfering the movement of the labia.<br>
Here, the method to wear the interlabial pads 76 and 78, which have the<br>
mini sheet piece, is briefly described with reference to Figs. 19 and 20. As the<br>
interlabial pad 76 shown in Fig. 19 and the interlabial pad 78 shown in Fig. 20<br>
are different in attaching each mini sheet piece, they can be different<br>
embodiments of the interlabial pads. However, with regard to the following<br>
description of the method to wear, the pads can be considered as the same<br>
pad.<br>
The wearer can insert her finger into a pocket 82 formed by the back side<br>
sheet 30 and the mini sheet piece 80, from an opening of the pocket 82 of a<br>
finger insertion opening, with a fingerpring side of a part till the first joint of the<br>
finger (fingertip) contacting the opposite side face to the body side face of the<br>
back side sheet 30, so that she can hold the interlabial pad 76 or 78 on the<br>
fingertip.<br>
When the finger is inserted into the pocket 82, the area with which the<br>
fingerprint side of the finger comes into contact has finger contact points which<br>
correspond to contact points suitable for locating the vaginal opening positioned<br>
deep inside the labia. The area including finger contact points comprises an<br>
area having the most suitable finger contact points for locating the vaginal<br>
opening, an area having suitable finger contact points, and an area having<br>
acceptable finger contact points. The finger insertion opening guides the<br>
inserted finger so that the fingerprint side of the fingertip may be brought to the<br>
area including the above-described finger contact points.<br>
Thus, when guiding the interlabial pad 76 or 78 to the labia 90, with the<br>
contact point (not shown) located on the body side face of the interlabial pad 76<br>
or 78 contacting the labia 90, by the medium of the absorber 28, by feeling the<br>
unevenness of the labia 90 with the finger cushion side of the fingertip inserted<br>
into the pocket 82, the interlabial pad 76 or 78 can be guided to the proper<br>
position in the labia 90, forming a concaved portion.<br>
After putting the interlabial pad 76 or 78 into the labia 90 and pulling the<br>
finger out from the pocket 82, the mini sheet piece 80 hangs slack opposite to<br>
the body side face as shown in Fig. 20. Therefore, a used interlabial pad 1 can<br>
be removed by pulling the mini sheet piece 80. In addition, the mini sheet piece<br>
80 made of non permeable or breathable material allows the wearer to pull and<br>
remove the interlabial pad 76 or 78 without soiling her fingers.<br>
Generally, it is preferable to use extensible or elastic materials for the<br>
mini sheet piece 80. Because even if the wearer's finger is larger than the<br>
provided finger insertion opening, the mini sheet piece 80 stretches at least<br>
breadthways corresponding to the wearer's finger size, which allows the wearer<br>
to insert her finger and place the interlabial pad 76 or 78 properly although the<br>
wearer may have a large or small fingertip size.<br>
Examples of materials essentially having elasticity include<br>
styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene<br>
block copolymer (SIS), synthetic rubber such as urethane rubber, films made<br>
from amorphous olefin resin having a density of 0.88 to 0.900 g/cm3, opening<br>
foam film and net. Woven fabrics or fabrics in which spun filaments made from<br>
synthetic rubber are interwoven can also be used. In addition, a spun bond<br>
nonwoven fabric, a melt blown nonwoven fabric and expanded foam sheet<br>
which mainly made from synthetic rubber can also be used.<br>
In considering a soft feeling in use, a preferred example is a porous foam<br>
film opening foam film made from SEBS, adjusted to be 15 to 40 µ thick and<br>
constructed to have pores of 0.28 to 1.77 mm2 covering 40 to 70 % of the total<br>
area.<br>
Examples of nonwoven fabric include materials which mainly comprise<br>
heat shrinkable compound synthetic fibers having a high-melting core part and<br>
a low-melting sheath part, such as PE/PP, PE/PET, PP/PP; including a spun<br>
lace nonwoven fabric whose fibers are entangled by water streams, shrink-type<br>
nonwoven fabric whose fibers are shrunk by reheating air processing and<br>
so-called extensible spun bond, which is a sheet made from continuous long<br>
fiberby heat sealing and forced tentering in the longitudinal direction.<br>
More specifically, a shrink-type nonwoven fabric which mainly comprises<br>
heat shrinkable compound synthetic fibers having a fineness of 1.1-4.4 dtex, a<br>
length of 7- 51 mm, high-melting core part and low-melting sheath part, such as<br>
PE/PP, PE/PET, PP/PP and adjusted to have a weight per unit area of 10 to 60<br>
g/m2 is a suitable material having a suitable softness and drape feeling.<br>
Laminated materials made of the materials described above can also be used.<br>
When non-extensible materials processed to have extensibility are used,<br>
raw materials of combined synthetic fibers such as PE/PP, PE/PET, PP/PP, etc.<br>
which have thermal extensibility and composed of a core with high melting point<br>
material and a sheath with low melting point material formed from a thru-air<br>
nonwoven fabric being heat-treated by hot air and having bulkiness, a<br>
spun-lace fabric with entangled fibers by water stream pressure, a spun-bond<br>
nonwoven fabric made into sheet with laminated continuous fibers, a needle<br>
punch nonwoven fabric with entangled fibers by a needle, an SMS nonwoven<br>
fabric made into a sheet by multi-layering spun-bond and melt-blown fabrics, etc.<br>
and films mainly composed of PE resin, or a combination thereof may be used.<br>
It is also possible to provide the above-described materials with<br>
extensibility using corrugate processing, in which the material is placed between<br>
male-female molds and embossed by heat, temperature and pressure. More<br>
specifically, the examples include a through air nonwoven fabric which mainly<br>
comprises compound synthetic fibers adjusted to have a fineness of 1.1 to 4.4<br>
dtex and a weight per unit area of 10 to 60 g/m2 and applied corrugate<br>
processing to have breadthways extensibility. Preferably, the male-female<br>
molds of the corrugate processing is arranged to achieve an extensibility at<br>
least 10 %, and more preferably, to have an extensibility of 20 to 50 %, yet<br>
more preferably, the processed material is extended by 30 % with a load of 0.01<br>
to 0.05 N/mm (Test condition: using tensilon tensile tester, velocity: 100<br>
mm/min., chuck interval: 100 mm). For providing the materials with extensibility,<br>
methods such as making incisions or perforating can be used.<br>
Hitherto, embodiments of the present invention using common<br>
materials have been described. In addition, the inventors have developed an<br>
interlabial pad which is also biodegradable, water dispersible and water-soluble.<br>
The description is as follows.<br>
[Structure of an interlabial pad which is also biodegradable, water dispersible<br>
and water-soluble]<br>
It is more preferable hat the interlabial pad of the present invention<br>
comprises biodegradable and/or water dispersible and/or water-soluble<br>
materials. Such interlabial pads can be dropped into toilets and flushed away,<br>
which allows the easy and sanitary disposal of used pads and reduces the<br>
refuse in toilet facilities.<br>
In this Specification, "biodegradable" means that a substance is<br>
decomposed into gas such as carbon dioxide or methane, water, and biomass<br>
under anaerobic or aerobic condition according to the natural process under the<br>
existence of bacteria represented by actinomycetes and other microbes, and<br>
also means that the biodegradability (biodegradable rate and biodegradable<br>
degree) of the substance equals to a material naturally generated such as fallen<br>
leaves or a synthetic polymer generally recognized having the same<br>
biodegradability under the same environment. "Water dispersible" has the same<br>
meaning as water diversifiable. It means a characteristic in which, while<br>
having no influence when used in a limited amount of moisture (menstrual<br>
blood), in a large amount of water or water current, the fabric is easily dispersed<br>
into small pieces at least to a degree where an ordinal toilet plumbing is not<br>
clogged. To be "water soluble" is to have a characteristic that, while having no<br>
influence when used in a limited amount of moisture (menstrual blood), the<br>
fabric is soluble in a large amount of water or water current.<br><surface side sheet permeable><br>
As the materials for water permeable sheets, along with a spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric, wet-process spun lacing nonwoven fabric selected from the<br>
nonwoven fabrics within a range of fiber length of 1 to 15 mm can be used. In<br>
addition to the above-described materials, resins which biodegrade by<br>
hydrolysis process, such as polylactic acid, polybutylene succinate can also be<br>
used. For example, a melt blown nonwoven fabric which is made from polylactic<br>
acid and adjusted to have a weight per unit area of 20 to 60 g/m2 or a spun<br>
bond nonwoven fabric adjusted to have a weight per unit area of 15 to 30 g/m2<br>
and a fineness of 1.1 to 3.3 dtex can be used. For each nonwoven fabric<br>
material, aperturing is optional.<br>
As another material, a synthetic or acetate fiber alone, or tow of<br>
continuous fiber of a laminated body may be used by adjusting a range of<br>
weight per unit area from 50 to 300 g/m2 and by raveling fibers each other.<br>
Moreover, among such materials, considering the hydrophilicity with the<br>
inner face of interlabia so as to be capable of preventing the wearer from feeling<br>
discomfort caused by slips between the interlabial pad and the surface of the<br>
labia, it is preferable to use wet-process spun lace nonwoven fabrics mainly<br>
comprising at least hydrophilic liquid fibers of cellulosic system.<br><absorber><br>
As the materials for absorbents, nonwoven fabric sheets made by<br>
needling can be used. Considering the biodegradability of polymer absorbents,<br>
it is preferable to use carboxymethyl cellulose fibers.<br><br>
As materials for back side sheet (water impermeable sheet), PVA films,<br>
film sheets made by applying water-repellent processing on one side, both<br>
sides or some parts of PVA films using silicone and so on, PVA films mixed with<br>
silicone, starch films, laminated paper comprising films made of resins which<br>
biodegrade by hydrolysis process, such as polylaci:ic acid and polybutylene<br>
succinate, and tissue. The materials may be colored by mixing inorganic<br>
pigments within a range of 0.1 to 5 % as required.<br>
When maintaining leakage prevention in humid conditions and avoiding<br>
an excessive load on septic tank is taken into consideration, a preferred<br>
material is laminated paper made by laminating a film made from polylactic acid<br>
to tissue having a thickness of 10 to 20 µ and a weight per unit area of 15 to<br>
20 g/m2, with a bonded area of 5 to 40 % of laminated area.<br><br>
As materials for laminated fiber composites, a wet-process spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric having a fiber length of 1 to 15 mm, along with a spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric, can be used. In addition to the above-described materials,<br>
resins which biodegrade by hydrolysis process, such as polylactic acid,<br>
polybutylene succinate can also be used. For example, a melt blown nonwoven<br>
fabric which is made from polylactic acid and adjusted to have a weight per unit<br>
area of 20 to 60 g/m2 or a spun bond nonwoven fabric adjusted to have a<br>
weight per unit area of 15 to 30 g/m2 and a fineness of 1.1 to 3.3 dtex can be<br>
used.<br><br>
As materials for the mini sheet piece, films, a spun bond nonwoven fabric<br>
and a melt brown nonwoven fabric made from biodegradable resins, such as<br>
polylactic ac'd, polybutylene succina'e; films and nonwoven fabrics made from<br>
water-soluble materials such as PVA and CMC; and water dispersible tissue<br>
and a spun lace nonwoven fabric mainly comprising cellulose fibers ,<br>
regenerated cellulose and others can be used.<br>
It is preferable to use sheets of a spun bond nonwoven fabric or a melt<br>
blown nonwoven fabric, which mainly comprise biodegradable materials, are<br>
adjusted to have a fineness of 0.1 to 3.3 dtex and a weight per unit area of 15 to<br>
40 g/m2 and are subjected to the mechanical corrugate processing.<br>
Fig. 21 is intended for a schematic explanation about how reduced<br>
contact area reduces the friction. The explanation is attempted to explain<br>
experimental results. However, it is not needed that the following mechanism<br>
works out to reduce the friction according to the present invention.<br>
The surfaces of the back side sheet 30, which are facing each other,<br>
have protruding and recesses parts 100, therefore, the surfaces do not contact<br>
over the whole area. The surfaces actually contact at point (A1, S1) 102, point<br>
(A2, S2) 104, point (A3, S3) 106, point (A4, S4) 108, point (A5, S5) 110 and point<br>
(A6, S6) 112; among these points, gaps 122, 124, 126, 128, 130 and 132 exist.<br>
Where Ak is an actual contact area and Sk is a shearing resisting strength per<br>
unit area of substances existing there (contaminants on the surface in many<br>
cases). Therefore, the frictional force f (60) caused by shearing such<br>
substances is (A1xS1)+(A2xS2)+(A3xS3)+(A4xS4)+(A5xS5)+(A6xS6). As Sk may<br>
be a physical property, which is usually considered to be constant, the frictional<br>
force f (60) is Skx(A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6). As (A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6) equals to the<br>
actual contact area between the back side sheet and itself, when this contact<br>
area is reduced, the friction will be reduced.<br>
As is clear from the result of the embodiments and explanation above, it<br>
is preferable to use not only textures but also materials suitable for reducing<br>
friction between the two sliding surfaces. For example, synthetic resins<br>
including slidable polymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene and known<br>
self-lubricating materials can be used in forming low friction shape. By using<br>
proper lubricants, including solid and fluid lubricants, in addition to the reduction<br>
by shape, still more friction reducing effects are expected.<br>
In the above, friction between the back side sheet and itself is described<br>
in detail. Friction between the back side sheet and other item, such as clothing,<br>
can be considered similarly. For example, for friction against underwear, it is<br>
similarly considered that a smaller contact area will make the friction smaller.<br>
Therefore, similar low friction shape can be considered.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, with respect to<br>
an interlabial pad which can make right and left phase shifts, if the back side<br>
sheet facing the garment side face has a structure and/or shape which less<br>
likely makes the intimate contact with the back side sheet itself, frictional<br>
resistance between the back side sheet and itself is decreased so that the<br>
interlabial pad can make right and left phase shifts easily. This can reduce the<br>
wearer's discomfort and it is unlikely that a friction force greater than the holding<br>
force of the labia to hold the interlabial pad applies to the back side sheet of the<br>
interlabial pad during the wearer's body motion.<br>
By making a structure and/or shape which reduces the close contact of<br>
the surfaces of the folded back side sheet from laminated fiber composites and<br>
films, the points where the surfaces of the folded back side sheet contact each<br>
other will be reduced. Thus the frictional resistance will be reduced. Also, gaps<br>
are produced. Therefore, even when the back side sheet becomes damp, the<br>
moisture does not stay on the contact surface of the back side sheet,<br>
consequently, the frictional resistance will not change noticeably.<br>
Employing the protrusion-recess processed surface structure ( or<br>
protrusion processed surface structure) , which makes less likely to have the<br>
close contact between the back side sheet and itself, the number of the contact<br>
points between the back side sheet and itself is reduced so as to reduce the<br>
frictional resistance. Also, gaps are produced so that even when the back side<br>
sheet becomes wet, moisture does not stay between the contacting surfaces of<br>
the back side sheet, and that the frictional resistance does not change<br>
noticeably. In addition, as the processing is applied secondarily, the<br>
manufacturing cost can be reduced.<br>
In addition, when the mini sheet piece is attached to the side of the back<br>
side sheet facing the clothing extending astride both sides of the longitudinal<br>
centerline, without interfering the right and left phase shifts of the interlabial pad,<br>
in some cases, the mini sheet piece can prevent the intimate contact between<br>
the back side sheet and itself by being placed between the folded back side<br>
sheet when worn by the wearer.<br>
According to the present invention, when an asymmetric motion, such as<br>
walking movement of the wearer, is made, a shearing force on right and left<br>
surfaces with regard to the longitudinal center line will be exerted on the<br>
interlabial pad supported between the labia. However, reducing the frictional<br>
resistance between the surfaces of the folded back side sheet facing the<br>
clothing will allow the interlabial pad to make right and left phase shifts easily.<br>
Therefore, when the friction force between the surfaces of the folded<br>
back side sheet is smaller than the strength of the labia to hold the interlabial<br>
pad, the interlabial pad can follow the wearer's body motions, which will<br>
remarkably reduce the possibility that the interlabial pad may fall.<br>
