				<td> The present invention relates to  benzazepine  compounds useful  in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzazepine derivatives having pharmacological activity, processes for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.<br>
JP 2001226269 and WO 00/23437 (Takeda Chem Ind Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of obesity. DE 2207430, US 4,210,749 and FR 2171879 (Pennwalt Corp) and 68 1268243 (Wallace and Tiernan Inc) all describe a series of benzazepine derivatives which are claimed as being antagonists for narcotics (such as morphine or codeine) and also antihistamines and anticholinergic agents. WO 02/14513 (Takeda Chem Ind Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives with GPR12 activity which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of attention deficit disorder, narcolepsy or anxiety. WO 02/02530 (Takeda Chem Ind Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives as GPR14 antagonists which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac infarction. WO 01/03680 (Isis Innovation Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives which are claimed as effective agents in the preparation of cells for transplantation in addition to the inhibition of diseases such as diabetes. WO 00/21951 (SmithKline Beecham plc) discloses a series of tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives as modulators of dopamine D3 receptors which are claimed to be useful as antipsychotic agents, WO 01/87834 (Takeda Chem Ind Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives as MCH antagonists which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of obesity. WO 02/15934 (Takeda Chem Ind Ltd) describe a series of benzazepine derivatives as urotensin II receptor antagonists which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The histamine H3 receptor is predominantly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), with minimal expression in peripheral tissues except on some sympathetic nerves (Leurs et at., (1998), Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 19,177-183). Activation of H3 receptors by selective agonists or histamine results in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from a variety of different nerve populations, including histaminergic and cholinergic neurons (Schlicker et al., (1994), Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 8,128-137). Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that H3 antagonists can facilitate neurotransmitter release in brain areas such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, relevant to cognition (Onodera ef a/., (1998), In: The Histamine H3 receptor, ed Leurs and Timmerman, pp255-267, Elsevier Science 8.V.). Moreover, a number of reports in the literature have demonstrated the cognitive enhancing properties of H3 antagonists (e.g. thioperamide, clobenpropit, ciproxifan and GT-2331) in rodent models including the five choice task, object recognition, elevated plus maze, acquisition of novel task and passive avoidance (Giovanni etal., (1999), Behav. Brain Res. 104,147-155). These data suggest that novel H3 antagonists and/or inverse agonists such as the current series could be useful for the<br><br>
treatment of cognitive impairments in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.<br>

Compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have affinity for and are antagonists and/or inverse agonists of the histamine H3 receptor and are believed to be of potential use in the treatment of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, dementia, age-related memory dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment, cognitive deficit, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, migraine, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and sleep disorders including narcolepsy; psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (particularly cognitive deficit of schizophrenia), attention deficit hypereactivity disorder, depression and addiction; and other diseases including obesity, asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastro-intestinal disorders.<br>
Thus the invention also provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a therapeutic substance in the treatment or prophylaxis of the above disorders, in particular cognitive impairments in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The invention further provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of the above disorders, in mammals including humans, which comprises administering to the sufferer a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of the above disorders.<br>
When used in therapy, the compounds of formula (I) are usually formulated in a standard pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared using standard procedures.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of the above disorders which comprises the compound of formula<br>
(I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable earner.<br>
The present invention further provides -a pharmaceutical composition which comprises the compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example histamine H1 antagonists or medicaments claimed to be useful as either disease modifying or symptomatic treatments of Alzheimer's disease. Suitable examples of such other therapeutic agents may be agents known to modify cholinergic transmission such as 5-HT6 antagonists, M1 muscarinic agonists, M2 muscarinic antagonists or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. When the compounds are used in combination with other therapeutic agents, the compounds may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously by any convenient route.<br>
The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together with a further therapeutic agent or agents.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention, which may be prepared by admixture, suitably at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, is usually adapted for oral, parenteral or rectal administration and. as such, may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable or infusible solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrable compositions are generally preferred.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose form, and may contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants<br>
and acceptable wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be in the form of a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), preservatives, and, if desired, conventional flavourings or colorants.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspension in a sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
The composition may contain from 0,1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. The dose of the compound used in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders will vary in the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and other similar factors. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be 0.05 to 1000 mg, more suitably 1.0 to 200 mg, and such unit doses may be administered more than once a day, for example two or three a day.   Such therapy may extend for a number of weeks or months.<br>

Biological Data<br>
A membrane preparation containing histamine H3 receptors may be prepared in accordance with the following procedures:<br><br>
(i)        Generation of histamine H3 cell line<br>
DNA encoding the human histamine H3 gene (Huvar, A. etal. (1999) Mol. Pharmacol. 55(6), 1101-1107) was cloned into a holding vector, pCDNA3.1 TOPO (InVitrogen) and its cDNA was isolated from this vector by restriction digestion of plasmid DNA with the enzymes BamH1 and Not-1 and ligated into the inducible expression vector pGene (InVitrogen) digested with the same enzymes. The GeneSwitchâ¢ system (a system where in transgene expression is switched off in the absence of an inducer and switched on in the presence of an inducer) was performed as described in US Patent nos: 5,364,791; 5,874,534; and 5,935,934. Ligated DNA was transformed into competent DH5a E. coli host bacterial cells and plated onto Luria Broth (LB) agar containing Zeocinâ¢ (an antibiotic which allows the selection of cells expressing the sh ble gene which is present on pGene and pSwitch) at 50^g ml"1. Colonies containing the re-ligated plasmid were identified by restriction analysis. DNA for transfection into mammalian cells was prepared from 250ml cultures of the host bacterium containing the pGeneHS plasmid and isolated using a DNA preparation kit (Qiagen Midi-Prep) as per manufacturers guidelines (Qiagen). CHO K1 cells previously transfected with the pSwitch regulatory plasmid (InVitrogen) were seeded at 2x1 Oe6 cells perT75 flask in Complete Medium, containing Hams F12 (GIBCOBRL, Life Technologies) medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialysed foetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and hygromycin (100^ig mr1}, 24 hours prior to use. Plasmid DNA was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine plus according to the manufacturers guidelines (InVitrogen). 48 hours post transfection cells were placed into complete medium supplemented with SOO^g ml"1 Zeocinâ¢.<br>
10-14 days post selection 10nM Mifepristone (InVitrogen), was added to the culture medium to induce the expression of the receptor. 18 hours post induction cells were detached from the flask using ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA; 1:5000; InVitrogen), following several washes with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 and resuspended in Sorting Medium containing Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), without phenol red, and supplemented with Earles salts and 3% Foetal Clone II (Hyclone). Approximately 1x 10e7 cells were examined for receptor expression by staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, 4a, raised against the N-terminal domain of the histamine H3 receptor, incubated on ice for 60 minutes, followed by two washes in sorting medium. Receptor bound antibody was detected by incubation of the cells for 60 minutes on ice with a goat anti rabbit antibody, conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescence marker (Molecular Probes). Following two further washes with Sorting Medium, cells were filtered through a SOjam Filconâ¢ (BD Biosciences) and then analysed on a FACS Vantage SE Flow Cytometer fitted with an Automatic Cell Deposition Unit. Control cells were non-induced cells treated in a similar manner. Positively stained cells were sorted as single cells into 96-well plates, containing Complete Medium containing 500ng ml"1 Zeocinâ¢ and allowed to expand before reanalysis for receptor expression via antibody and ligand binding studies. One clone, 3H3, was selected for membrane preparation.<br><br>
(ii)       Membrane preparation from cultured cells<br>
All steps of (he protocol are carried out at 4Â°C and with pre-cooled reagents. The cell pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A2 containing 50mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7,40) supplemented with 10e-4M leupeptin (acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-arginal; Sigma L2884), 25ng/ml bacitracin (Sigma B0125), 1mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), 1mM phenylmetnylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2x10e-6M pepstain A (Sigma). The cells are then homogenised by 2 x 15 second bursts in a 1 litre glass Waring blender, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 20 minutes. The supernatant is then spun at 48.000g for 30 minutes. The pellet is resuspended in 4 volumes of buffer A2 by vortexing for 5 seconds, followed by homogenisation in a Dounce homogeniser (10-15 strokes). At this point the preparation is aliquoted into polypropylene tubes and stored at -70Â°C.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be tested for in vitro biological activity in accordance with the following assays:<br>
