				<td>The present application relates to method of synthesis of protected pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) compounds, and in particular, PBDs having a N-10 protecting group, as well as intermediates in these methods.<br>
Background<br>
A large number of both synthetic and naturally occurring low molecular weight ligands are known that interact with DNA via a number of different mechanisms, including covalent or non-covalent interaction in the minor or major grooves, intercalation between base pairs or other types of nonspecific interactions.<br>
A particular class of compounds which interacts with the minor groove are the pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs). PBDs have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequence of DNA; the most preferred sequence is PuGPu (Purine-Guanine- Purine ) . The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al.,   J. Am.   Chem.   Soc.,   87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al.,   J. Am.    Chem.   Soc,    87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al. ,    Chem.   Rev.   1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski et al.,   1987 J". Antibiotics,   40, 145-148), chicamycin (Konishi et al.,   1984 J.   Antibiotics,   37, 200-206), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-10 487; Thurston et al.,   1990, Chem.   Brit.,   26, 767-772; Bose et al.,    1992 Tetrahedron,   48, 751-758), mazethramycin (Kunimoto et   al.,   1980 J.   Antibiotics, 33, 665-667), neothramycins A and B(Takeuchi et al., 1976 J. Antibiotics, 29, 93-96), porothramycin (Tsunakawa et al., 1988 J". Antibiotics,   41, 1366-1373), prothracarcin (Shimizu et al.,   1982 J.   Antibiotics,   35, 972-978; Langley and Thurston, 1987 J". Org.    Chem.,   52, 91-97), sibanomicin (DC-102) (Hara et al.,   1988 J.   Antibiotics,   41, 702-704; Itoh et al.,   1988 J.   Antibiotics,   41, 1281-1284), sibiromycin (Leber et<br><br><br>
al., 1988 J. Am. Chero. Soc., 110, 2992-2993) and tomamycin (Arima et al., 1972 J. Antibiotics, 25, 437-444).<br>
PBDs are of the general structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring.  There is either an imine (N=C), carbinolamine (NH-CH(OH))or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH-CH(OMe))at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA.  These forms may exist in equilibrium in solution. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral Clla position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring.  This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, 1975 In Antibiotics III. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11; Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, 1986 Ace. Chem. Res., 19, 230-237).  Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.<br>
The present inventors have previously disclosed that PBDs can be employed as prodrugs by protecting them at the N10 position with a nitrogen protecting group which is removable in vivo (WO 00/12507). Many of these protecting groups are carbamates, and are, for example, of the structure(Figure Removed)where * indicates the attachment point to the N10 atom of the PBD.  These protecting groups are described as being added to the compound at two different stages in the synthesis route. One stage is addition of the corresponding chloroformate to a precursor structure as follows, which precursor is then cyclised to form the desired final compound: (Figure Removed)An alternative route discussed involves adding the corresponding chloroformate to a carboxy aniline precursor of the starting material in the above route.<br>
These routes employ a chloroformate reacting with an (aromatic) amine to form the carbamate.  The present inventors have discovered that the use of the chloroformate has disadvantages, and have therefore developed an alternative synthesis route, which does not employ a chloroformate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a method of synthesis of a compound of formula (I):<br>
(Figure Removed)comprising the step of either:<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of<br>
formula (III) to yield a compound of formula (IV): (Figure Removed)<br>
(b) reacting a compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula (III) to yield a compound of formula (VI): (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
the dotted lines indicate the optional presence of a double bond<br>
between Cl and C2 or C2 and C3;<br>
R2 and R3 are independently selected from -H, -OH, =0, =CH2, -CN,<br>
-R, OR, =CH-R, 0-S02-R, C02R and COR;<br>
R6, R7 and R9 are independently H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH2, NHR,<br>
NRR', nitro, Me3Sn and halo;<br>
R8 is either selected from H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH2r NHR, NRR',<br>
nitro, MeaSn and halo or the compound is a dimer with each monomer<br>
being the same of different and being of the relevant formula,<br>
where the R8 groups of each monomer form together a bridge having<br>
the formula -X-R"-X~, where R" is a C3_12 alkylene group, which<br>
chain may be interrupted by one or more heteroatoms, e.g. 0, S,<br>
NH, and/or aromatic rings, e.g. benzene or pyridine, and each X<br>
is independently selected from 0, S and NH;<br>
R10 is such that R10-OC(=0)- forms a nitrogen protecting group;<br>
R11 is either H or R;<br>
R12 is an optionally substituted C1-4 alkyl group;<br>
P and Q are such that -CPQ is a masked aldehyde group;<br>
wherein R and R' are independently selected from optionally<br>
substituted C1-30 alkyl, C3-20 heterocyclyl, and C5-20 aryl.<br>
.Reaction conditions<br>
The reactions above should be carried in an anhydrous and non-hydroxylic organic solvent, which is preferably non-polar. Suitable solvents include anhydrous dichloromethane and anhydrous toluene.  The reaction should be carried out in the presence of a base is present, and suitable bases include pyridine or TEA.  The reaction may be carried out at 0°C, or at a higher temperature to increase the rate of reaction.<br>
Further .Reaction Steps<br>
If the method of synthesis of the first aspect of the invention comprises step (a), then the synthesis of the compound of formula (I) from the compound of formula (IV) will be according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein T is O or S, and each Rac is independently selected from C3-10 alkyl or together can be a C1-3 alkylene group.<br>
Thus the synthesis further comprise the following steps:<br>
(i) hydrolysis of the ester -C(=O)OR12;<br>
(ii)coupling of resulting acid with a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
TRac wherein M is either OH or <br>
(a)	when M is OH, oxidation of the resulting<br>
compound to yield a compound of formula (Ia);<br><br>
(b)	when M is palladium mediated<br>
unmasking of the resulting compound to yield a<br>
compound of formula (Ia); and<br>
(iii)    converting the compound of  formula  (Ia)  to a compound of formula (I)by:<br>
(a) direct etherification of compound of formula (Ia) or treatment of compound of formula (Ia) with R11SH and preferably Lewis Acid or treatment of compound of formula (Ia) with R11NH and preferably Lewis Acid, depending upon whether X is 0, S or NH, respectively.<br>
The ester hydrolysis is usually carried out under mild conditions, for example at 0°C with lithium hydroxide or under non-basic conditions, if the carbamate is sensitive to these. In this situation suitable R12 groups would include allyl, butyl and benzyl.<br>
The coupling reaction is preferably carried out under mild conditions, with preferred conditions being DCC or HOBt in DCM at low temperature. Oxalyl chloride and thionyl chloride may be used, but are less preferred.<br>
Oxidation of the deprotected primary alcohols provokes spontaneous PBD B-ring closure. A number of oxidizing agents/conditions can be employed to achieve ring closure including; Swern Oxidation, SO3-Pyridine/DMSO, pyridinium dichromate, TPAP/NMO, Dess-Martin Periodinane and TEMPO-DAIB. The TEMPO/DAIB system is particularly favored as it does not require rigorous anhydrous conditions, reaction is easily monitored by TLC, and there is no evidence of over-oxidation to the PBD dilactam species.<br><br>
The palladium mediated demasking can be carried out under literature conditions, such as using bisacetonitrile palladium chloride, (CH3CN)2PdCl2, in acetone (Lipshutz, B.H., et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 26, 705 (1985)).<br>
The compound of formula (II) can be synthesised according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Removed)Thus the synthesis further comprise the following steps: (i)  esterification, by reaction with R12OH; and (ii) reaction with triphosgene to form isocynate.<br><br>
The esterification is carried out under normal conditions, the ester is commercially available itself.<br><br>
Often<br><br>
The conversion to the isocyanate can be carried out by the action of phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate or triphosgene, of which triphosgene is the preferred agent as is is an easy to handle crystalline solid rather than a toxic gas. The reaction should be carried in an anhydrous and non-hydroxylic organic solvent, which is preferably non-polar.  Suitable solvents include anhydrous dichloromethane and anhydrous toluene.  The reaction may be carried out at room temperature, and is conveniently monitored by infrared spectroscopy at about 2260 cnf<br>
If the method of synthesis of the first aspect of the invention comprises step (b), then the synthesis of the compound of formula<br>
 (I) from the compound of formula (VI) will be according to the following scheme(Figure Removed)Thus the synthesis comprises the following steps: (i)  (a)  if -CPQ represents a protected alcohol group, deprotection followed by oxidation; or (b)  if -CPQ represents an acetal or thioacetal, palladium mediated unmasking; and (ii)  (a)  if XR11 is OR11, direct etherification;<br>
(b)	if XR11 is SR", treatment with RnSH and a catalyst,<br>
such as a Lewis Acid, e.g. A12C&gt;3)<br>
(c)	if XR11 is NHR11, treatment with RnNH and a catalyst,<br>
such as a Lewis Acid, e.g. A1203) .<br>
The hydroxyl protecting groups (if present) must be removed to allow B-ring cyclization to take place.  Removal is under standard conditions.  For example, an acetate protecting group can be removed under extremely mild conditions with potassium carbonate.  A silyl ether protecting group can be removed by fluoridolysis using TBAF or with mild acid.  If these conditions are unsuitable for a particular carbamate, alternative hydroxyl protecting groups can be selected as long as they are capable of surviving the reduction of the nitro group.<br>
The conditions for the remaining reactions are as described above in relation to the first method.<br>
(Figure Removed)coupling of acid with hydroxymethyl pyrrole; or<br>
(b)  coupling of acid with acetalmethyl pyrrole; (ii) reduction of aromatic nitro group to form aromatic ainine group; and (ii) reaction with triphosgene to form isocynate.<br>
Commercially available nitrobenzoic acids are converted to acid chlorides and coupled to pyrrolidinemthanol and its derivatives under literature conditions.  Free hydroxyl groups may be protected as silyl ethers or acetates (other protectings groups, including acetals such as MEM or MOM,  can be employed as long as they are stable to the conditions requires to reduced the aromatic nitro group) in order to prevent the formation of a bridging carbamate in the isocyanate formation step.<br>
The reduction of the nitro group can be carried out under standard conditions. Preferred methods include hydrogenation over a palladium on charcoal catalyst in a Parr hydrogenator, and using sodium dithionite, tin(II) chloride or Raney Nickel and hydrazine, depending on the requirements of the hydroxyl protecting group.<br>
The isocyante forming step is carried out as described above.<br>
A second aspect of the invention is a compound of formula (IV)<br>
(Figure Removed), wherein R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and R12 are as defined in the first aspect of the invention.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention is a compound of formula (VI) :<br>
(Figure Removed), wherein R2, R3, R6, R7, RB, R9, R10, P and Q are as defined in the first aspect of the invention, and the dotted lines indicate the optional presence of a double bond between Cl and C2 or C2 and C3.<br>
Definitions<br>
Masked aldehyde group (-CPQ):  The term masked aldehyde group pertains to a group which can be chemically converted into an aldehyde group, and includes in particular, a protected alcohol group (-CH2OProt), wherein the alcohol protecting group is orthogonal to the nitrogen protecting group, acetal groups (-C(ORac)2) ,thioacetal groups (-C(SRac)2), where each RBC can be independently selected from C1-10 alkyl or together can be a C1-3 alkylene group.<br>
Alcohol Protecting Group:  This term pertains to a group which is removable leave an alcohol group, without affecting the remainder of the compound to which the alcohol group is attached.  Of particular interest are ethers and esters, numerous examples of which are described in Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference.  Examples include ethers, in particular silyl ethers (e.g. tert-butyl-dimethyl-silyl ether), esters, for examples acetates and carbonates.<br>
Orthogonal:  Protecting groups are orthogonal to one another, if one protecting group can be removed from a molecule in which the other protecting group is present, without the other protecting group being removed.  For example, the alcohol protecting group acetate is orthogonal to the nitrogen protecting group Teoc, and the alcohol protecting group TBDMS is orthogonal to the nitrogen protecting group benzyloxy carbamate.<br>
Nitrogen Protecting Group:  This term pertains to a group which is removable from the N10 position of the PBD moiety to leave an N10-C11 imine bond.  This application is only concerned with those nitrogen protecting groups which are carbamate, i.e. those which have the structure:<br>
The nature of R10 can vary widely, and is chosen dependent on the conditions by which the whole group is eliminated from the molecule. A large number of suitable groups are described in Greene and Wuts, ""Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference.  These groups include many well know groups such as fmoc (9-fluorenylmethylcarbamate), Troc (2,2,2-trichloroethyl carbamate) and Alloc (allyl carbamate) which can be removed under varying conditions.  Also described are carbamate based nitrogen protecting groups which can be cleaved photolytically, such as o-nitrobenzyl carbamate and Nvoc (6-nitroveratryl carbamate).lso of interest are groups which can be cleaved by the action of enzymes.  These include the following:<br><br>
roup<br>
Removab(Figure Removed)<br>
These groups, and others, are described in, for example, Jungheim, L. and Shepherd, T., Chem. Rev., 94, 1553-1566 (1994), WO 00/64864 and Niculescu-Duvaz, D., et al.f J. Med. Chem., 41, 5  5297-5309 (1998).<br>
Further enzyme labile groups include the following:<br>
(Figure Removed)Prodrugs with such protecting groups are also reviewed Dubowchik, G.M. and Walker, M.A., Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 83, 67-123 (1999).<br>
A number of nitrogen protecting groups (including some of the enzyme labile groups discussed above) can be classed as containing a Aself-immolative linker'.  Such groups usually has a structure:<br><br>
where Y is NH or 0, n is 0 to 3 and R'10 is such that the whole moiety is a nitrogen protecting group (and may be defined as for R10 below).  The self-immolative linker will allow for release of the protected compound when a remote site is activated, proceeding along the lines shown below (for n=0): (Figure Removed) represents a resin bead.<br>
The R10 group can be described as an optionally substitued Ca_30 alkyl group, C3-30 heterocylyl group or a C5_30 aryl group or a divalent version of one of these groups linked to another moiety. It is preferred that R10 is not a silane group or is substituted by a silyl group (e.g. -CH2-Si (Me) 3) .<br>
The present invention allows the synthesis of N-10 protected PBD compounds where the appropriate chloroformate is not available or is unstable.  This for example applies to the Moz (methoxybenzyl carbamate) group which cannot be introduced via the chloroformate as it is too unstable, and other derivatives such as Moz-ON are not sufficiently active to react with a PBD-precursor aniline group.  However, the p-methoxybenzyl alcohol is commercially available and reacts smoothly with the isocyanate to give the Moz carbamate (see examples, compound 17).  The case of the Teoc<br>
carbamate reinforces the point; again the required chloroformate is not very stable and not commercially available.  A p-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative of Teoc is available but, again, is not sufficiently active to protect an aromatic amine such as compound 5.  Trimethylsilylethanol is commercially available and reacts with isocyanates to afford the Teoc carbamate in good yields (see examples, compound 18).<br>
The method of the invention is particularly useful for complex protecting groups, such as those shown in the examples as alcohols 35 and 42.  Such protecting groups are required to prepare PBD prodrugs for ADEPT approaches to cancer chemotherapy, and the alcohols are not commercially available and give rise to extremely unstable chloroformates.  However, these alcohols react with isocyanates to furnish carbamates in moderate to good yields.<br>
Alkyl:  The term "alky!" as used herein, pertains to a monovalent moiety obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom of a hydrocarbon compound having from I to 20 carbon atoms (unless otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic, and which may be saturated or unsaturated (e.g., partially unsaturated, fully unsaturated).  Thus, the term "alkyl" includes the sub-classes alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyenyl, cylcoalkynyl, etc., discussed below.<br>
In the context of alkyl groups, the prefixes (e.g., C1-4, C1-7, C1-20, C2-7, C3-7, etc.) denote the number of carbon atoms, or range of number of carbon atoms.  For example, the terra "C1-4 alkyl" as used herein, pertains to an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of groups of alkyl groups include C1-4 alkyl ("lower alkyl"), C1-7 alkyl, C1-20 alkyl and C1-30 alkyl. Note that the first prefix may vary according to other limitations; for example, for unsaturated alkyl groups, the first prefix must be at least 2; for cyclic and branched alkyl groups, the first prefix must be at least 3; etc.<br>
amples of saturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (C1) , ethyl (C2) , propyl (C3) , butyl (C4), pentyl (C5) , hexyl (C6), heptyl (C7) , octyl (C8) , nonyl (C9) , decyl (C10) , undecyl (C11) , dodecyl (C12) , tridecyl (C13) , tetradecyl (C14) , pentadecyl (C15), and eicodecyl (C20) •<br>

Examples of unsaturated alkenyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethenyl (vinyl, -CH=CH2), 1-propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) , 2-propenyl (allyl, -CH-CH=CH2), isopropenyl (1-methylvinyl, -C(CH3)=CH2), butenyl (C4) , pentenyl (C5), and hexenyl (C6) .<br>
Alkynyl:  The term "alkynyl" as used herein, pertains to an alkyl group having one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds.  Examples of groups of alkynyl groups include C2_4 alkynyl, C2.7 alkynyl, C2.20 alkynyl.<br>
Examples of unsaturated alkynyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethynyl (ethinyl, -C=CH) and 2-propynyl {propargyl, -CH2-CsCH).<br>

Alkylene<br>
C3_i2 alkylene:  The term "C3-i2 alkylene", as used herein, pertains to a bidentate moiety obtained by removing two hydrogen atoms, either both from the same carbon atom, or one from each of two different carbon atoms, of a hydrocarbon compound having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms (unless otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic, and which may be saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated.  Thus, the term "alkylene" includes the sub-classes alkenylene, alkynylene, cycloalkylene, etc., discussed below.<br>
Examples of linear saturated C3_i2 alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, -(CH2)n- where n is an integer from 3 to 12, for example, -CH2CH2CH2- (propylene) , -CH2CH2CH2CH2- (butylene), -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- (pentylene) and -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH;- (heptylene) .<br>
Examples of branched saturated C3-i2 alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, -CH(CH3) CH2-, -CH(CH3) CH2CH2-,<br>
-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH (CH3) CH2-, -CH2CH (CH3) CH2CH2-, -CH (CH2CH3)-, -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, and -CH2CH (CH2CH3) CH2-.<br>
Examples of linear partially unsaturated C3-i2 alkylene groups (C3_i2 alkenylene, and alkynylene groups) include, but are not limited to, -CH=CH-CH2-, -CH2-CH=CH2-, -CH=CH-CH2-CH:-, -CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2-, -CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-, and -CH2-CsC-CH2-.<br>
Examples of branched partially unsaturated C3_i2 alkylene groups (C3_i2 alkenylene and alkynylene groups) include, but are not<br>
limited to, -C(CH3)=CH-, -C (CH3) =CH-CH2-, ~CH=CH-CH (CH3) - and -CsC-CH(CH3)-.<br>
Examples of alicyclic saturated C3-i2 alkylene groups (C3.12 cycloalkylenes) include, but are not limited to, cyclopentylene (e.g. cyclopent-1,3-ylene), and cyclohexylene (e.g. cyclohex-1,4-ylene).<br>
Examples of alicyclic partially unsaturated C3_i2 alkylene groups (C3-i2 cycloalkylenes) include, but are not limited to, cyclopentenylene (e.g. 4-cyclopenten-l,3-ylene), cyclohexenylene (e.g. 2-cyclohexen-l,4-ylene; 3-cyclohexen-l,2-ylene; 2,5-cyclohexadien-l,4-ylene).<br>
The term "Ca-3 alkylene" as used herein, is defined in a similar manner to the above group, but with from 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Solvents<br>
Solvents may conveniently be classified according to one or more of their physical or chemical properties.<br>
For example, solvents may be classified according to their polarity, that is, their permanent dipole moment.  Examples of highly polar solvents include dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide, and acetonitrile (ACN).  Examples of moderately polar solvents include acetone, methanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), and water. Examples of relatively non-polar solvents include diethyl ether, chloroform, and dichloromethane (DCM).  Examples of non-polar and virtually non-polar solvents include alkanes, benzene, toluene, and carbon tetrachloride.<br>
Solvents may also be classified as "protic" or "aprotic" according to their proton-exchange properties.  Protic solvents accept and/or donate protons.  Examples of protic solvents include water, alcohols, carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid),<br>
and amines (e.g., ammonia, pyridine).  Aprotic solvents neither accept nor donate protons.  Examples of aprotic solvents include carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile (ACN), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), toluene, benzene, acetone, ethers (e.g., diethyl ether), alkanes (e.g., hexane), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sulfur dioxide, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), and, .tetramethylurea. Amphoteric solvents, such as water, are capable of both accepting and donating protons.<br>
Solvents may be classifed as "hydroxylic" or "non-hydroxylic" according to whether they contain one or more hydorxoyl, i.e. -OH, groups.  Hydroxylic solvents include water and alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol), and non-hydroxylic solvents include dichoromehtane and toluene.<br>
Solvents may also be classified as "organic" or "inorganic" according to their chemical composition.  Conventionally, organic solvents comprise, at least, carbon atoms, while inorganic solvents do not.  Examples of inorganic solvents include water, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide.<br>
Anhydrous solvents are solvents which contain less than 0.1% by weight of water, and preferably less than 0.01% or 0.001% by weight of water.<br>

General Experimental Methods<br>
The progress of reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using Merck grade 7749 silica gel containing binding and fluorescence indicators, on glass plates. Visualization of TLC plate was achieved with UV light, unless otherwise stated. Flash column chromatography was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063). The majority of organic solvents and reagents used were bought from Fischer, Lancaster and Aldrich Chemical Co. and inorganic drying agents from BDH.<br>
1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker 250 MHz/52mm; IR spectra were recorded with a FT-IR Spectrometer Spectrum 1000. The optical rotation of compounds was determined at ambient temperature with an ADP 220 polarimeter. Mass Spectrometry was carries out on a Micromass platform using either electrospray or Atmospheric Pressure chemical ionisation.  Microanalysis was performed using a Carlo Erba 1108 elemental analyser.<br>
