				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection system for engines, especially to an electronic-controlled fuel injection system suitable for motors with small or medium displacement.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In prior art, the fuel supply apparatus used in the engines of motors with small or medium displacement are generally carburetors. The function of the carburetors is to atomize the fuel into fine particles, to mix air with the atomized fuel at a suitable ratio (air / fuel ratio) and to supply the engine with a gas mixture with optimum air / fuel ratio.<br>
The change rule of the air / fuel ratio provided by the carburetor in the engine depends on the flow rules of the fuel and air. Because the carburetor provides fuel by vacuum sucking, it is difficult to provide gas mixture in optimum air / fuel ratio and make the gas mixture fully burnt. The engine cannot maintain at the best efficiency. In addition, the levels of exhaust emissions from motors and the fuel economy are not satisfactory.<br>
In addition, the throttle of the traditional carburetors controls the amount of fuel by adjusting the jet. Therefore, it cannot automatically control the concentration<br>
2<br><br>
of gas mixture instantaneously according to the changes of the operating conditions and situations of the engine. It also can not control the air/fuel ratio around the theoretical value. By using carburetor to supply fuel, the air / fuel ratio of the gas mixture is either too big or too small.<br>
In order to provide the engine with a gas mixture at an optimum ratio under any operating conditions, and to control the concentration of the gas mixture instantaneously according to the changes of the operating conditions and situations of the engine, a lot of studies have been made. However, there hardly have been successful reports until now. Although some progresses have been achieved in electronic fuel injection technology of engines with big displacement or twin-cylinder and four-stroke, because of its complicated structure and high cost, it is difficult to manufacture industrially.<br>
Besides, it is hard to be applied directly to tour-stroke and single cylinder motor engines with small or medium displacements.<br>
CN2399520 discloses an electronic fuel injection apparatus for engines. It mainly relates to the circuits and the processing of signals. However, it does not disclose the connection modes between the apparatus and the engine and the working procedure.<br>
3<br><br>
CN2351577 discloses an electronic fuel injection apparatus for motors. It also does not disclose the connection modes between the apparatus and the engine and the working procedure.<br>
EP0212988 discloses a control apparatus for worm gear pressure-increasing internal combustion engine. It discloses part technologies of electronic fuel injection for engines. However, since the number of the controlling points is relatively less and the locations of the controlling points are not reasonable, it can not realize the "precise control" as mentioned in the present invention.<br>
EP0397521 discloses a circular control system for engines. The electric controlled portion also has defects of less data collecting units and unreasonable location of said units. It also can not realize the "precise control", as mentioned in the present invention.<br>
Objects of The Invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide an electronic fuel injection system especially suitable for internal combustion engines with small or medium displacement, including four-stroke motors with single cylinder.<br>
The second object of the present invention is to provide an engine using the above-mentioned electronic fuel injection system suitable for motors with small<br>
or medium displacement.<br>

The fuel in the fuel tank 21, after pressure adjusting by the fuel pressure adjuster 3, will be delivered into the electronic-driven fuel injector 16.<br>
When the starter button of the engine is pressed, the sensor 7, will have a movement. The movement will produce a weak signal, and this signal will be delivered to the ECU 18. After receiving this signal, the ECU 18 will send a starting signal to the relay of the fuel pump 1 to make it connected to power, and the fuel pump 1 will start to work.<br>

following step (f), if the answer is N, then make a criterion : "whether the opening degree of the throttle-last opening degree of the throttle &gt; the reference value"; if the answer is N, back to step (h); if the answer is Y, allocate the subprogram for the stored charts, adjust the results from the charts and back to step<br>

16.	An electronic-controlled fuel injection system for a motor, substantially as<br>
herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
17.	An engine incorporating an electronic-controlled fuel injection system for a<br>
motor,  substantially as herein described,  particularly with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

18. A motor incorporating an electronic-controlled fuel injection system substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An electronic-controlled fuel injection system for motors, comprises a fuel pump (1), a fuel rail (4), a temperature sensor (5) for inlet air, a sensor (7) for controlling the opening of the throttle, a temperature sensor (9) for sensing the temperature of the cylinder, a sensor (12) for detecting the rotating speed and ignition signal, an igniter (15), an electronic-driven fuel injector (16) , which are connected with an ECU (18) respectively, the ECU being connected with power via wires (17), wherein :<br>
said ECU comprises a microprocessor and converting circuit (32), a signal processing circuit (33), an ignition circuit (34), a fuel injection circuit (35), a fuel pump control circuit (36), a signal collection circuit (37), a reposition circuit (38), an external connection circuit (39) and a power supply circuit (40);<br>
said circuit (35) is adapted to cause said fuel injection device to be started on the basis of fuel injection time and calculated results stored in the memory of the ECU, and also is adapted to stop the fuel injection device in accordance with the overall running program stored in said memory ; and<br>
when the motor is under the state of adding fuel or accelerating, the fuel-saving and protection device will not work ; when the motor is under the state of decreasing fuel or coasting, this device will control the fuel injection device to stop injecting fuel.<br></td>
