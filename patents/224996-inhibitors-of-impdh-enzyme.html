				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
class of compounds which inhibit IMPDH. This invention<br>
also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention are particularly well<br>
suited for inhibiting IMPDH enzyme activity and<br>
consequently, may be advantageously used as therapeutic<br>
agents for IMPDH mediated processes. This invention<br>
also relates to methods for inhibiting the activity of<br>
IMPDH using the compounds of this invention and related<br>
compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The synthesis of nucleotides in organisms is<br>
required for the cells in those organisms to divide and<br>
replicate. Nucleotide synthesis in mammals may be<br>
achieved through one of two pathways: the de novo<br><br>
synthesis pathway or the salvage pathway. Different<br>
cell types use these pathways to a different extent.<br>
Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase<br>
(IMPDH; EC 1.1.1.205) is an enzyme involved in the de<br>
novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. IMPDH<br>
catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of inosine-5'-<br>
monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine-5'-monophosphate<br>
(XMP)[Jackson R.C. et. al., Nature, 256, pp. 331-333,<br>
(1975)].<br>
IMPDH is ubiquitous in eukarvotes, bacteria<br>
and protozoa [Y. Natsumeda &amp; S.F. Carr, Ann. N.Y.<br>
Acad., 696, pp. 88-93 (1993)]. The prokaryotic forms<br>
share 30-40% sequence identity with the human enzyme.<br>
Regardless of species, the enzyme follows an ordered<br>
Bi-Bi reaction sequence of substrate and cofactor<br>
binding and product release. First, IMP binds to<br>
IMPDH. This is followed by the binding of the cofactor<br>
NAD. The reduced cofactor, NADH, is then released from<br>
the product, followed by the product, XMP [S.F. Carr et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 268, pp. 27286-90 (1993); E.W.<br>
Holmes et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 364, pp. 209-217<br>
(1974)]. This mechanism differs from that of most<br>
other known NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, which have<br>
either a random order of substrate addition or require<br>
NAD to bind before the substrate.<br>
Two isoforms of human IMPDH, designated type<br>
I and type II, have been identified and sequenced [F.R.<br>
Collart and E. Huberman, J. Biol. Chem., 2 63, pp.<br>
15769-15772, (1988); Y. Natsumeda et. al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 265, pp. 5292-5295, (1990)]. Each is 514 amino<br>
acids, and they share 84% sequence identity. Both<br>
IMPDH type I and type II form active tetramers in<br>
solution, with subunit molecular weights of 56 kDa [Y.<br><br>
Yamada et. al., Biochemistry, 27, pp. 2737-2745<br>
(1988)].<br>
The de novo synthesis of guanosine<br>
nucleotides, and thus the activity of IMPDH, is<br>
particularly important in B and T-lymphocytes. These<br>
cells depend on the de novo, rather than salvage<br>
pathway to generate sufficient levels of nucleotides<br>
necessary to initiate a proliferative response to<br>
mitogen or antigen [A.C. Allison et. al., Lancet II,<br>
1179, (1975) and A.C. Allison et. al., Ciba Found.<br>
Symp., 48, 207, (1977)]. Thus, IMPDH is an attractive<br>
target for selectively inhibiting the immune system<br>
without also inhibiting the proliferation of other<br>
cells.<br>
Immunosuppression has been achieved by<br>
inhibiting a variety of enzymes including for example,<br>
the phosphatase calcineurin (inhibited by cyclosporin<br>
and FK-506); dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme<br>
involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines (inhibited<br>
by leflunomide and brequinar); the kinase FRAP<br>
(inhibited by rapamycin); and the heat shock protein<br>
hsp70 (inhibited by deoxyspergualin). [See B. D. Kahan,<br>
Immunological Reviews, 136, pp. 29-49 (1993); R. E.<br>
Morris, The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,<br>
12(6), pp. S275-S286 (1993)].<br>
Inhibitors of IMPDH are also known. United<br>
States patents 5,380,879 and 5,444,072 and PCT<br>
publications WO 94/01105 and WO 94/12184 describe<br>
mycophenolic acid (MPA) and some of its derivatives as<br>
potent, uncompetitive, reversible inhibitors of human<br>
IMPDH type I (Ki=33 nM) and type II (Ki=9 nM) . MPA has<br>
been demonstrated to block the response of B and T-<br>
cells to mitogen or antigen [A. C. Allison et. al.,<br>
Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 696, 63, (1993).<br><br>
Immunosuppressants, such as MPA, are useful<br>
drugs in the treatment of transplant rejection and<br>
autoimmune diseases. [R. E. Morris, Kidney Intl., 49,<br>
Suppl. 53, S-26, (1996)]. However, MPA is<br>
characterized by undesirable pharmacological<br>
properties, such as gastrointestinal toxicity and poor<br>
bioavailability. [L. M. Shaw, et. al., Therapeutic Drug<br>
Monitoring, 17, pp. 690-699, (1995)].<br>
Nucleoside analogs such as tiazofurin,<br>
ribavirin and mizoribine also inhibit IMPDH [L.<br>
Hedstrom, et. al. Biochemistry, 29, pp. 849-854<br>
(1990)]. These compounds, which are competitive<br>
inhibitors of IMPDH, suffer from lack of specificity to<br>
this enzyme.<br>
Mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug which<br>
quickly liberates free MPA in vivo, was recently<br>
approved to prevent acute renal allograft rejection<br>
following kidney transplantation. [L. M. Shaw, et.<br>
al., Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, 17, pp. 690-699,<br>
(1995); H. W. Sollinger, Transplantation, 60, pp. 225-<br>
232 (1995)]. Several clinical observations, however,<br>
limit the therapeutic potential of this drug. [L. M.<br>
Shaw, et. al., Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, 17, pp.<br>
690-699, (1995)]. MPA is rapidly metabolized to the<br><br>
inactive glucuronide in vivo. [A.C., Allison and E.M.<br>
Eugui, Immunological Reviews, 136, pp. 5-28 (1993)].<br>
The glucuronide then undergoes enterohepatic recycling<br>
causing accumulation of MPA in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract where it cannot exert its IMPDH inhibitory<br>
activity on the immune system. This effectively lowers<br>
the drug's in vivo potency, while increasing its<br>
undesirable gastrointestinal side effects.<br>
It is also known that IMPDH plays a role in<br>
other metabolic events. Increased IMPDH activity has<br>
been observed in rapidly proliferating human leukemic<br>
cell lines and other tumor cell lines, indicating IMPDH<br>
as a target for anti-cancer as well as<br>
immunosuppressive chemotherapy [M. Nagai et. al.,<br>
Cancer Res., 51, pp. 3886-3890, (1991)]. IMPDH has<br>
also been shown to play a role in the proliferation of<br>
smooth muscle cells, indicating that inhibitors of<br>
IMPDH, such as MPA or rapamycin, may be useful in<br>
preventing restenosis or other hyperproliferative<br>
vascular diseases [C. R. Gregory et al.,<br>
Transplantation, 59, pp. 655-61 (1995); PCT publication<br>
WO 94/12184; and PCT publication WO 94/01105].<br>
Additionally, IMPDH has been shown to play a<br>
role in viral replication in some viral cell lines.<br>
[S.F. Carr, J. Biol. Chem., 268, pp. 27286-27290<br>
(1993)]. Analogous to lymphocyte and tumor cell lines,<br>
the implication is that the de novo, rather than the<br>
salvage, pathway is critical in the process of viral<br>
replication.<br>
The IMPDH inhibitor ribavirin is currently<br>
being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis-C virus<br>
(HCV) and hepatitis-B virus (HBV) infection and<br>
disease. Ribavirin enhances the sustained efficacy of<br><br>
interferon in HBV and HCV treatment. However, the<br>
therapeutic potential of ribavirin is limited by its<br>
lack of a sustained response in monotherapy and broad<br>
cellular toxicity.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for potent IMPDH<br>
inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties.<br>
Such inhibitors would have therapeutic potential as<br>
immunosuppressants, anti-cancer acrents, anti-vascular<br>
hyperproliferative agents, antiinflammatory agents,<br>
antifungal agents, antipsoriatic and anti-viral agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compounds, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that<br>
are useful as inhibitors of IMPDH. These compounds can<br>
be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic<br>
or prophylactic agents, such as anti-virals, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, antibiotics, and<br>
immunosuppressants for the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
transplant rejection and autoimmune disease.<br>
Additionally, these compounds are useful, alone or in<br>
combination with other agents, as therapeutic and<br>
prophylactic agents for antiviral, anti-tumor, anti-<br>
cancer, antiinflammatory agents, antifungal agents,<br>
antipsoriatic immunosuppressive chemotherapy and<br>
restenosis therapy regimens.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising the compounds of this<br>
invention, as well as multi-component compositions<br>
comprising additional IMPDH compounds together with an<br>
immunosuppressant. The invention also provides methods<br>
of using the compounds of this invention, as well as<br>
other related compounds, for the inhibition of IMPDH.<br>
The compounds of this invention, as well as<br>
those used in the methods of this invention demonstrate<br>
a different metabolic profile than MPA and its<br>
derivatives. Because of this difference, methods of<br>
this invention and the compounds used therein may offer<br>
advantages as therapeutics for IMPDH mediated disease.<br>
These advantages include increased overall therapeutic<br>
benefit and reduction in deleterious side effects.<br>

N, 0 or S. Those heteroatoms may replace any carbon<br>
atoms in these ring systems as long as the resulting<br>
compound is chemically stable.<br>
The term "wherein each X is the number of<br>
hydrogen atoms necessary to complete proper valence"<br>
means that X is 0, 1 or 2 hydrogen atoms, depending<br>
upon the identity of the ring atom to which X is bound<br>
(C, N, 0 or S), the identity of the two adjacent ring<br>
atoms, and the nature of the bonds between the ring<br>
atom to which X is bound and the two adjacent ring<br>
atoms (single, double or triple bond). In essence,<br>
this definition is meant to exclude from X any<br>
substituents other than hydrogen.<br>
The term "amino protecting group" refers to a<br>
suitable chemical group which may be attached to a<br>
nitrogen atom. The term "protected" refers to when the<br>
designated functional group is attached to a suitable<br>
chemical group (protecting group). Examples of<br>
suitable amino protecting groups and protecting groups<br>
are described in T.W. Greene and P.G..M. Wuts,<br>

such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by<br>
allowing an orally administered compound to be more<br>
readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance<br>
delivery of the parent compound to a biological<br>
compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system)<br>
relative to the parent species. Preferred prodrugs<br>
include derivatives where a group which enhances<br>
aqueous solubility or active transport through the gut<br>
membrane is appended to the structure of formulae I-IX.<br><br>

synthesized using conventional techniques.<br>
Advantageously, these compounds are conveniently<br>
synthesized from readily available starting materials.<br><br>
In general, compounds of formula (I)-(IX) are<br>
conveniently obtained via methods illustrated in<br>
General Synthetic Schemes 1-3.<br>
In General Synthetic Scheme 1 (see below), an<br>
X-substituted aniline is reacted with a Y-substituted<br>
phenylisocyanate under standard conditions to give the<br>
desired urea. In this process, X and Y may be one or<br>
more independent substituents (or their suitably<br>
protected variants) as exemplified by the ring<br>
substituents listed for compounds of formulae I-IX<br>
above, at any position on the aromatic ring.<br><br>
In General Synthetic Scheme 2 (see above), a<br>
substituted benzaldehyde (here, 2-methoxy-4-nitro-<br>
substituted) is treated sequentially with<br>
tosylmethylisocyanide, to give the resulting oxazole,<br>
then reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to give the<br>
desired aniline. Reaction of this aniline with an<br>
isocyanate (here, m-tolylisocyanate) under standard<br>
conditions gives the desired urea.<br>
An alternate synthetic route is illustrated<br>
in General Synthetic Scheme 3 (see above). A<br>
substituted benzaldehyde (here 4-nitro substituted) is<br>
converted to the corresponding oxazolyl aniline as<br>
shown in General Synthetic Scheme 2. This aniline is<br>
treated with a substituted benzoic acid (here, 3-<br>
methyl-substituted) and a carboxylic acid activating<br>
agent, such as diphenylphosphoryl azide, under standard<br>
reaction conditions, to give the desired urea.<br>
As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan,<br>
the above synthetic schemes are not intended to<br>
comprise a comprehensive list of all means by which the<br>
compounds described and claimed in this application may<br>
be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the<br>
various synthetic steps described above may be<br>
performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the<br>
desired compounds.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be<br>
modified by appending appropriate functionalities to<br>
enhance selective biological properties. Such<br>
modifications are known in the art and include those<br>
which increase biological penetration into a given<br>
biological compartment (e.g., blood, lymphatic system,<br>
central nervous system), increase oral availability,<br><br>
increase solubility to allow administration by<br>
injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of<br>
excretion.<br>
The novel compounds of the present, invention<br>
are excellent ligands for IMPDH. Accordingly, these<br>
compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting IMPDH<br>
enzyme. Inhibition can be measured by various methods,<br>
including, for example, IMP dehydrogenase HPLC assays<br>
(measuring enzymatic production of XMP and NADH from<br>
IMP and NAD) and IMP dehydrogenase spectrophotometric<br>
assays (measuring enzymatic production of NADH from<br>
NAD). [See C. Montero et al., Clinica Chimica Acta,<br>

Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a<br>
maintenance dose of a compound, composition or<br>
combination of this invention may be administered, if<br>
necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of<br>
administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function<br>
of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved<br>
condition is retained when the symptoms have been<br>
alleviated to the desired level, treatment should<br>
cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent<br>
treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of<br>
disease symptoms.<br>
As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower<br>
or higher doses than those recited above may be<br>
required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for<br>
any particular patient will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors, including the activity of the specific<br>

In order that this invention be more fully<br>
understood, the following examples are set forth.<br>
These examples are for the purpose of illustration only<br>
and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any way.<br>
General Materials and Methods<br>
All temperatures are recorded in degrees<br>
Celsius. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried<br>
out using 0.25 mm thick E. Merck silica gel 60 F254<br>
plates and elution with the indicated solvent system.<br><br>
Detection of the compounds was carried out by treating<br>
the plate with an appropriate visualizing agent, such<br>
as 10% solution of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol or a<br>
0.1% solution of ninhydrin in ethanol, followed by<br>
heating, and/or by exposure to UV light or iodine<br>
vapors when appropriate. Analytical HPLC was carried<br>
out using a Rainin Mycrosorb-MV, 5µ, Cyano reverse phase<br>
column, 3.9mm x 150mm, with a flow rate of 1.0mL/minute<br>
and a solvent gradient of 5-100% acetonitrile (0.1%<br>
TFA) in water (0.1% TFA). HPLC retention times were<br>
recorded in minutes. NMR spectral data was acquired<br>
using a Bruker AMX500 in the indicated solvent.<br>
The IMP dehydrogenase HPLC assay follows our<br>
standard conditions for the enzymatic production of XMP<br>
and NADH from IMP and NAD, but utilizes high pressure<br>
liquid chromatography on a C18 column with ion pairing<br>
reagents to separate all four components. The extent<br>
of reaction is then determined from the resulting<br>
product peak areas. This assay is particularly useful<br>
for determining the inhibition profiles of compounds<br>
which have significant absorbance in the UV-visible<br>
region between 290 and 340 nM.<br>
The reaction mixture typically contains 0.1 M<br>
KPi; pH 8.0, 0.1M KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 0.2<br>
mM each of IMP and NAD. This solution is incubated at<br>
37°C for 10 minutes. The reaction is started by the<br>
addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 20 to<br>
100 nM, and is allowed to proceed for 10 minutes.<br>
After the allotted time, the reaction is quenched by<br>
the addition of mycophenolic acid to a final<br>
concentration of 0.01 mM.<br>
The extent of conversion is monitored by HPLC<br>
using a Rainin Microsorb ODS column C18-200 of<br><br>
dimensions 4.6 X 10 mm and a solvent system containing<br>
tetrabutylammonium sulfate (5mM) in 0.1 M KPi pH 6.0<br>
with a 0-30% methanol gradient over 15 minutes. A<br>
similar solvent system has been used previously for the<br>
purification of halo-IMP derivatives. [L. C. Antionio<br>
and J. C. Wu, Biochemistry, 33, 1753-1759 (1994).] A<br>
UV-monitor set at 254 nM is used to detect the four<br>
components, and the product peaks are integrated to<br>
determine the extent of conversion of the substrates.<br>
For the analysis of inhibitors, the compound<br>
in question is dissolved in DMSO to a final<br>
concentration of 20 mM and added to the initial assay<br>
mixture at the desired concentration in a volume of 2-<br>
5% (v/v). The reaction is started by the addition of<br>
enzyme and after 10 minutes is quenched as above.<br>
After HPLC analysis, the product areas are used to<br>
determine the extent of conversion relative to a<br>
control assay containing only DMSO and no test<br>
compound. IC50 or Ki values are determined from non<br>
linear least squares fitting of conversion vs<br>
concentration curves to the tight-binding equations of<br>
Henderson. [P. J. F. Henderson, Biochem. J., 127, 321<br>
(1972) .]<br>
We have measured the inhibition constants of<br>
each compound against IMPDH using an adaptation of the<br>
method first reported by Magasanik. [B. Magasanik, H.<br>
S. Moyed, and L. B. Gehring J. Biol. Chem., 22 6, p.339<br>
(1957)].<br>
Insofar as compounds of formulae I-IX are<br>
able to inhibit IMPDH, they are of evident clinical<br>
utility for the treatment of IMPDH mediated disease.<br>
These tests are predictive of the compounds ability to<br>
inhibit IMPDH in vivo.<br>
Experimental Section<br>
Synthesis of Representative Examples:<br><br>
To a solution of 25mg (156 µmole) 4-(5-<br>
oxazolyl)-aniline in 250µL CH2Cl2 was added 50µL (400<br>
Hmole) of benzyl isocyanate at ambient temperature.<br>
After stirring overnight, 1 was isolated in pure form<br>
by filtration with a 3:1 hexanes/CH2Cl2 rinse in a<br>
yield of 21mg (46%). 1H NMR (500MHz, CDCl3) d 7.86(s),<br>

H2SO4 (6.9mL) in a dropwise fashion. Upon complete<br>
addition, CrO3 (8.08g, 80.8mmole) was added portion-<br>
wise over 60 mins. Following an additional 15 mins of<br>
stirring at 0 °C, the reaction mixture was poured over<br>
ice and the resulting precipitate was isolated by<br>
filtration, rinsing with cold H2O. Purification by<br>
flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 15-50%<br>
EtOAc in hexanes, provided 2.02g (24%, 40% based on<br>
recovered starting material) Bl as a white solid. The<br>
1H NMR was consistent with that of the desired<br>

to yield a yellow solid. Purified product was obtained<br>
through two recrystallizations from hot Et20/hexanes,<br>
yielding 620mg (47.6%) B2 as a lightly yellowed<br>
crystalline solid. The 1H NMR was consistent with that<br>

tosylmethyl isocyanide (236mg, 1.2mmol), and powdered<br>
K2CO3 (172mg, 1.2mmole) in methanol (13mL) was heated<br>
at reflux for 90 minutes and then stirred overnight at<br>
ambient temperature. Upon concentration to dryness,<br>
the mixture was partitioned between CH2Cl2 and water.<br>
The organics were separated, washed with 0.5N HC1,<br>
water and brine and then dried over Na2SO4. The<br>
solvent was removed in vacuo to provide a crude yellow<br>
solid. Purified product B3 was obtained through flash<br>
chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 0-2.5% CH3OH<br>
in CH2Cl2, and recrystallization (CH2Cl2/hexanes) in a<br>
yield of 3.3g (68%) as a light yellow crystalline<br>
solid. The ^H NMR was consistent with that of the<br>
desired structure.<br><br>
A solution of B3 (150mg, 0.67mmole) in<br>
ethanol (7.5mL) was treated with SnCl2?2H2O (excess;<br>
ca. 5 equivalents) and heated at reflux for 30 minutes.<br>
The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, diluted<br>
with diethyl ether and partitioned with 2N NaOH. The<br>
organics were separated, washed with water and brine,<br>
dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacua. Purified<br>
product B4 was obtained through flash chromatography,<br>
eluting with a gradient of 0-0.5% CH3OH in CH2Cl2, in a<br>
yield of 54mg (41.5%) as a light yellow oil. The 1H<br>
NMR was consistent with that of the desired structure.<br><br>
To a solution of 20mg (l03 µmole) B4 in lmL<br>
CH2Cl2 was added 20µL m-tolylisocyanate at ambient<br>
temperature. After stirring overnight, 43 was isolated<br>

IMPDH Activity Inhibition Assay<br>
We measured the inhibition constants of the<br>
compounds listed in Table III utilizing the following<br>
protocol:<br>
IMP dehydrogenase activity was assayed<br>
following an adaptation of the method first reported by<br>
Magasanik. [Magasanik, B. Moyed, H. S. and Gehring L.<br>
B. (1957) J. Biol. Chem. 226, 339]. Enzyme activity<br>
was measured spectrophotometrically, by monitoring the<br>
increase in absorbance at 34 0 nm due to the formation<br>
of NADH (8340 is 6220 M-1 cm-1). The reaction mixture<br>
contained 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 M KC1, 3 mM EDTA, 2 mM<br>
DTT, 0.1 M IMP and enzyme (IMPDH human type II) at a<br>
concentration of 15 to 50 nM. This solution is<br>
incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. The reaction is<br>
started by adding NAD to a final concentration of 0.1M<br>
and the initial rate is measured by following the<br>
linear increase in absorbance at 340 nm for 10 minutes.<br>
For reading in a standard spectrophotometer (path<br>
length 1 cm) the final volume in the cuvette is 1.0 ml.<br>
The assay has also been adapted to a 96 well microtiter<br>
plate format; in this case the concentrations of all<br>
the reagents remain the same and the final volume is<br>
decreased to 200 µl.<br>
For the analysis of inhibitors, the compound in<br>
question is dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration<br>
of 20 mM and added to the initial assay mixture for<br>
preincubation with the enzyme at a final volume of 2-<br>
5% (v/v). The reaction is started by the addition of<br>
NAD, and the initial rates measured as above. Ki<br>
determinations are made by measuring the initial<br>
velocities in the presence of varying amounts of<br>
inhibitor and fitting the data using the tight-binding<br>
equations of Henderson (Henderson, P. J. F. (1972)<br>
Biochem. J. 127, 321].<br>
These results are shown in Table III. Ki<br>
values are expressed in nM. Category "A" indicates<br>
0.01 to 50 nm activity, category "B" indicates 51-1000<br>
nm activity, category "C" indicates 1001 to 10,000 nm<br>
activity, category "D" indicates greater than 10,000 nm<br>
activity. The designation "ND" is used where a given<br>
compound was not tested.<br>
