				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified glucagon-<br>
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) compounds and related compositions and methods useful in<br>
treating conditions or disorders benefited by lowering blood glucose, decreasing food<br>
intake, decreasing gastric or intestinal emptying, increasing beta (8) cell number and/or<br>
function and/or inhibiting ß cell apoptosis, or decreasing gastric or intestinal motility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
GLP-1 induces numerous biological effects such as stimulating insulin secretion,<br>
inhibiting glucagon secretion, inhibiting gastric emptying, inhibiting gastric motility or<br>
intestinal motility, enhancing glucose utilization, and inducing weight loss. GLP-1 may<br>
further act to prevent the pancreatic β-cell deterioration that occurs as non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) progresses. A significant characteristic of GLP-1<br>
is its ability to stimulate insulin secretion without the associated risk of hypoglycemia.<br>
GLP-l induces insulin secretion only when glucose levels are elevated unlike other<br>
therapies that act by increasing insulin expression regardless of whether glucose levels are<br>
elevated.<br>
The usefulness of therapy involving GLP-1 peptides has been limited by the fact<br>
that GLP-1 (1-37) is poorly active, and the two naturally occurring truncated peptides,<br>
GLP-1 (7-37)011 and GLP-1 (7-36)NH2, are rapidly cleared in vivo and have extremely<br>
short in vivo half lives, it is known that endogenously produced dipeptidyl-peptidase [V<br>
(DPP-IV) inactivates circulating GLP-1 peptides by removing the N-terminal histidine<br>
and alanine residues and is a major reason for the short in vivo half-life.<br>
While various approaches have resulted in GLP-1 compounds with a longer half-<br>
life or greater potency than that of native GLP-1. additional compounds are needed to<br>
further decrease clearance and increase half-life thereby optimizing GLP-1 's ability to be<br>
useful as a therapeutic that can be administered a minimum number of times during a<br>
prolonged period of time. International Application Nos, PCT/US2004/006082 and<br>
PCT/US2000/11814 describe covalent attachment of one or more molecules of PEG to<br>
various GLP-1 and exendin compounds. These compounds may have a half-life in excess<br>
2-<br><br><br>
of 24 hours allowing for fewer administrations of the PEGylated GLP-1 compound while,<br>
maintaining a high blood level of the compound over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Further research has elucidated a problem wherein the separation of PEG from a<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 or exendin compound occurs during prolonged shelf storage. As a<br>
result, the free GLP-1 or exendin peptide increases the initial peak concentration exposure<br>
profile through the therapeutic window. This has the possibility of increasing the side<br>
effects of nausea and vomiting.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the problems associated with the<br>
prolonged shelf storage and the potential of separation of PEG from the PEGylated GLP-<br>
1 or exendin compound by introducing two PEGylation sites into a GLP-1 or exendin<br>
compound and then PEGylating those two PEGylation sites simultaneously. The<br>
advantages of this approach are at least four-fold. First, PEGylation of the compounds<br>
will dramatically improve the in vivo half-lives of the compounds. Second. PEGylation<br>
of the compounds will slow down the absorption rate of the compound and thus, reduce<br>
initial burst of the drug that is believed to be responsible for the side effects. Third, linear<br>
PEGs can be used directly for PEGylation and will simplify the synthesis procedure.<br>
Fourth, tandem PEGylation will alleviate the issues associated with prolonged shelf<br>
storage and the potential of separation of PEG from the PEGylated GLP-1 or exendin<br>
compound by decreasing the probability that both PEGs will be separated from the same<br>
GLP-1 or exendin peptide molecule.<br>
Additionally, introducing two PEGylation sites into a GLP-1 or exendin<br>
compound at the C-terminal end of the compound and then PElGylating those two<br>
PEGylation sites simultaneously resulted in PEGylated compounds having greater<br>
activity over those PEGylated compounds wherein at least one of the PEGylation sites is<br>
not at the C-terminal end of the peptide. Further, attaching a linker comprising two<br>
PEGylation sites at the C-terminal end of a GLP-1 compound and then PEGylating those<br>
two PEGylation sites simultaneously resulted in PElGylated GLP-1 compounds having<br>
greater activity over those PEGylated compounds wherein the PEGylation sites are<br>
attached at the C-terminal end of a GLP-1 compound without a linker.<br>
Such PEGylated GLP-1 compounds may be used therapeutically to treat subjects<br>
with disorders including, but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, gastric and/or intestinal<br>
motility abnormalities, beta (8) cell deficiency (e.g. insufficient or nonfunctioning 8<br><br><br>
cells), and gastric and/or intestinal emptying abnormalities with a particular advantage<br>
being that the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention require fewer doses during a<br>
24 hour period, increasing both the convenience to a subject in need of such therapy and<br>
the likelihood of subjec's compliance with dosing requirements.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gluc'agon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a 37 amino acid peptide secreted by the L-<br>
cells of the intestine in response to food ingestion. Numerous GLP-1 analogs and<br>
derivatives have been described in the art. The present invention describes modifications<br>
to GLP-1 compounds that result in extended elimination half-life and/or reduced<br>
clearance. Incorporation of cysteine residues into particular amino acid sites of the<br>
peptide provides a thiol group to which a polyethylene glycol (PEG) or PEG derivative<br>
may be covalently attached resulting in a PEGylated GLP-1 compound.<br>
The term "GLP-1 compound' as used herein, includes native GLP-1, [GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH or GLP-1 (7-36)NH2], GLP-1 analogs, GLP-1 derivatives, GLP-1 biologically<br><br><br>
active fragments, extended GLP-1 or an analog or fragment of an extended GLP-1<br>
peptide, exendin-4 analogs and exendin-4 derivatives. Preferably, a GLP-1 analog has<br>
the amino acid sequence of GLP-l(7-37)OH or an extended GLP-1 peptide so that 1, 2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or 6 amino acids differ from the amino acid in the corresponding position of GLP-<br>
l(7-37)OH or a fragment of GLP-l(7-37)OH or modified so that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6<br>
amino acids differ from the amino acid in the corresponding position of an extended<br>
GLP-1 peptide.<br>
The term "PEGylated" when referring to a GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention refers to a GLP-1 compound that is chemically modified by covalent<br>
attachment of two molecules of polyethylene glycol or a derivative thereof.<br>
Furthermore, it is intended that the term "PEG" refers to polyethylene glycol or a<br>
derivative thereof as are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,445,090:<br>
5.900,461; 5.932,462; 6,436,386; 6,448,369; 6,437,025; 6,448,369: 6,495,659; 6,515,100<br>
and 6.514,491). Preferably, in PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention,<br>
PEG (or a derivative thereof) is covalently attached to two introduced cysteine residues in<br>
the GLP-1 compound. Preferably, the two introduced cysteine residues in the GLP-1<br>
compound are at position 45 and 46.<br>
"Insulinotropic activity" refers to the ability to stimulate insulin secretion in<br>
response to elevated glucose levels, thereby causing glucose uptake by cells and<br>
decreased plasma glucose levels. Insulinotropic activity can be assessed by methods<br>
known in the art. including using in vivo experiments and in vitro assays that measure<br>
GLP-1 receptor binding activity or receptor activation, e.g., assays employing pancreatic<br>
islet cells or insulinoma cells, as described in EP 619,322 to Gelfand, el al, and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,120,712, respectively. Insulinotropic activity is routinely measured in<br>
humans by measuring insulin levels or C-peptide levels. For the purposes of the present<br>
invention an in vitro GLP-1 receptor signaling assay is used to determine whether a<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present invention will exhibit insulinotropic activity<br>
in vivo. Insulinotropic activity is an activity that may be used to demonstrate that the<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 compound is biologically active. All exemplified PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compounds of the invention have insulinotropic activity (See Example 6).<br>
"In vitro potency" as used herein, is the measure of the ability of a peptide to<br>
activate the GLP-1 receptor in a cell-based assay, In vitro potency ,is expressed as the<br><br><br>
"EC50" which is the effective concentration of compound that results in 50% activity in a<br>
single dose-response experiment. For the purposes of the present invention, in vitro<br>
potency is determined using a fluorescence assay that employs HEK-293 cells that stably<br>
express the human GLP-1 receptor. These HEK-293 cells have stably integrated a DNA<br>
vector having a cAMP response element (CRE) driving expression of the lucif erase gene.<br>
The interaction of a GLP-1 compound or a PEGvlated GLP-1 compound with the<br>
receptor initiates a signal that results in activation of the cAMP response element and<br>
subsequent expression of luciferase. The EC50 values for the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compounds listed in Example 3 were determined using the luciferase assay described<br>
above. Relative hi vitro potency values may be established by running Val,s-GLP-1(7-<br>
37)OH or native GLP-1 as a control and assigning the control a reference value of 100%.<br>
The term "plasma half-life" refers to the time in which half of the relevant<br>
molecules circulate in the plasma prior to being cleared. An alternatively used term is<br>
'elimination half-life." The term "extended'" or "longer' used in the context of plasma<br>
half-life or elimination half-life indicates there is a statistically significant increase in the<br>
half-life of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound relative to that of the reference molecule (e.g.,<br>
the non-PEGylated form of the peptide or the native peptide) as determined under<br>
comparable conditions. Preferably a PEGylated GLP-1 compound of the present<br>
invention has an elimination half-life of at least one hour, more preferably at least 3, 5, 7,<br>
10. 15, 20 hours and most preferably at least 24 hours. The half-life reported herein in<br>
Examples 4 and 5 are the elimination half-life; it is that which corresponds to the terminal<br>
log-linear rate of elimination. Those of skill in the art appreciate that half-life is a derived<br>
parameter that changes as a function of both clearance and volume of distribution.<br>
Clearance is the measure of the body's ability to eliminate a drug. As clearance<br>
decreases due, for example, to modifications to a drug, half-life would be expected to<br>
increase. However, this reciprocal relationship is exact only when there is no change in<br>
the volume of distribution. A useful approximate relationship between the terminal log-<br>
linear half-life (t ½). clearance (C), and volume of distribution (V) is given by the<br>
equation: t½≈ 0.693 (V/C). Clearance does not indicate how much drug is being<br>
removed but, rather, the volume of biological fluid such as blood or plasma that would<br>
have to be completely freed of drug to account for the elimination. Clearance is<br>
expressed as a volume per unit of time. The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br><br><br><br>
invention have a clearance value of 200 ml/h/kg or less, or 180, 150, 120, 100, 80, 60<br>
ml/h/kg or less, or 50, 40 or 20 ml/h/kg or less (See Example 4 and 5).<br>
In the present invention, a Cys amino acid is incorporated at positions 45 and 46<br>
of the GLP-1 compounds. The resulting molecule is PEGylated at the Cys amino acids<br>
resulting in a modified molecule that retains all or a portion of biological activity while<br>
having a longer half-life than that of the unmodified molecule or than that of a native<br>
molecule.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds for use in the present invention can be prepared by using<br>
standard methods of solution phase or solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
Once a GLP-1 compound is prepared and purified, it is PEGylated by covalently<br>
linking two PEG molecules to the GLP-1 compound. A wide variety of methods have<br>
been described in the art to covalently conjugate PEGs to peptides (for review article see,<br>
Roberts, M. et al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54:459-476, 2002), PEGylation of<br>
peptides at the carboxy-terminus may be performed via enzymatic coupling using<br>
recombinant GLP-1 peptide as a precursor or alternative methods known in the art and<br>
described. See e.g. U.S. Patent 4,343,898 or International Journal of Peptide &amp; Protein<br>
Research.43:127-38, 1994. One method for preparing the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds<br>
of the present invention involves the use of PEG-maleimide to directly attach PEG to a<br>
thiol group of the peptide. The introduction of a thiol functionality can be achieved by<br>
adding or inserting a Cys residue onto or into the peptide at positions described above. A<br>
thiol functionality can also be introduced onto the side-chain of the peptide (e.g. acylation<br>
of lysine s-amino group of a thiol-containing acid). A PEGylation process of the present<br>
invention utilizes Michael addition to form a stable thioether linker. The reaction is highly<br>
specific and takes place under mild conditions in the presence of other functional groups.<br>
PEG maleimide has been used as a reactive polymer for preparing well-defined, bioactive<br>
PEG-protein conjugates. It is preferable that the procedure uses a molar excess of a thiol-<br>
containing GLP-1 compound relative to PEG maleimide to drive the reaction to<br>
completion. The reactions are preferably performed between pH 4.0 and 9.0 at room<br>
temperature for 1 to 40 hours. The excess of unPEGylated thiol-containing peptide is<br>
readily separated from the PEGylated product by conventional separation methods.<br>
Exemplary conditions required for PEGylation of GLP-1 compounds are set forth in<br>
Example 1 and 2. Cysteine PEGylation may be performed using PEG maleimide or<br><br>
bifurcated PEG maleimide. A preferred PEG is a 20 kilodalton linear methoxy PEG<br>
maleimide.<br>
In its typical form, PEG is a linear polymer with terminal hydroxy] groups and has<br>
the formula HO-CH2CH2-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-OH5 where n is from about 8 to about<br>
4000. The terminal hydrogen may be substituted with a protective group such as an alkyl<br>
or aryl group. Preferably, PEG has at least one hydroxy group, more preferably it is a<br>
terminal hydroxy group. It is this hydroxy group which is preferably activated to react<br>
with the peptide. There are many forms of PEG useful for the present invention.<br>
Numerous derivatives of PEG exist in the art and are suitable for use in the invention.<br>
(See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5.445,090; 5.900.461; 5,932,462: 6.436,386; 6.448,369;<br>
6,437,025; 6,448,369: 6,495,659; 6,515,100 and 6,514,491 and Zalipsky, S. Bioconjugate<br>
Chem. 6:150-165. 1995). The PEG molecule covalently attached to GLP-1 compounds in<br>
the present invention is not intended to be limited to a particular type. PEG'S molecular<br>
weight is preferably from 500-100,000 daltons and more preferably from 20,000-60,000<br>
daltons and most preferably from 20,000-40,000 daltons. PEG may be linear or<br>
branched.<br>
PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention have an in; vitro biological<br>
activity that is at least 0.5% that of native GLP-1 or of Valg-GLP-l (7-37)OH. PEGylated<br>
GLP-1 compounds of the present invention have an in vitro biological activity that is at<br>
least 1% that of native GLP-1 or of Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH. PEGylated GLP-1 compounds<br>
of the present invention have an in vitro biological activity that is at least 3% that of<br>
native GLP-1 or of Val8-GLP-l (7-37)OH. Such biological activity may be determined by<br>
the in vitro potency assay as described herein (Example 3) or by other GLP-1 assays<br>
known in the art. Although some PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the invention may<br>
have biological activity lower than that of native GLP-1 or of Val8-GLP-l (7-37)OH as<br>
measured in a particular assay; this activity decrease is compensated by the compound's<br>
extended half-life and/or lower clearance value.<br>
Administration of the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds may be via any route known<br>
to be effective by the physician of ordinary skill. Peripheral parenteral is one such<br>
method. Parenteral administration is commonly understood in the medical literature as<br>
the injection of a dosage form into the body by a sterile syringe or some other mechanical<br>
device such as an infusion pump. Peripheral parenteral routes can include intravenous,<br><br><br><br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal routes of administration. The PEGylated<br>
GLP-1 compounds of the present invention may also be amenable to administration by<br>
oral, rectal, nasal, or lower respiratory routes, which are non-parenteral routes. Of these<br>
non-parenteral routes, the lower respiratory route and the oral route are preferred.<br>
The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention can be used to treat a<br>
wide variety of diseases and conditions. The PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention primarily exert their biological effects by acting at a receptor referred to as the<br>
"GLP-1 receptor." Subjects with diseases and/or conditions that respond favorably to GLP-1<br>
receptor stimulation or to the administration of GLP-1 compounds can therefore be treated<br>
with the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention. These subjects are said to<br>
"be in need of treatment with GLP-1 compounds" or "in need of GLP-1 receptor<br>
stimulation". Included are subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes, insulin dependent<br>
diabetes, stroke (see WO 00/16797), myocardial infarction (see WO 98/08531), obesity (see<br>
WO 98/19698), catabolic changes after surgery (see U.S. Patent No. 6,006,753), functional<br>
dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (see WO 99/64060). Also included are subjects<br>
requiring prophylactic treatment with a GLP-1 compound, e.g., subjects at risk for<br>
developing non-insulin dependent diabetes (see WO 00/07617). Subjects with impaired<br>
glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, subjects whose body weight is about 25%<br>
above normal body weight for the subject's height and body build, subjects with a partial<br>
pancreatectomy, subjects having one or more parents with non-insulin dependent diabetes,<br>
subjects who have had gestational diabetes and subjects who have had acute or chronic<br>
pancreatitis are at risk for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes.<br>
An effective amount of the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds described herein is the<br>
quantity which results in a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect without causing<br>
unacceptable side-effects when administered to a subject in need of GLP-1 receptor<br>
stimulation. A "desired therapeutic effect" includes one or more of the following: 1) an<br>
amelioration of the symptom(s) associated with the disease or condition; 2) a delay 'in the<br>
onset of symptoms associated with the disease or condition; 3) increased longevity<br>
compared with the absence of the treatment; and 4) greater quality of life compared with<br>
the absence of the treatment. For example, an "effective amount" of a PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compound for the treatment of diabetes is the quantity that would result in greater control<br>
of blood glucose concentration than in the absence of treatment, thereby resulting in a<br><br><br><br>
delay in the onset of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy or kidney<br>
disease. An "effective amount" of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound for the prevention of<br>
diabetes is the quantity that would delay, compared with the absence of treatment, the<br>
onset of elevated blood glucose levels that require treatment with anti-hyperglycaemic<br>
drugs such as sulfonyl ureas, thiazolidinediones, metformin, insulin and/or bisguanidines.<br>
Typically, the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention will be administered<br>
such that plasma levels are within the range of about 5 picomoles/liter and about 200<br>
picomoles/liter. Optimum plasma levels for Vals-GLP-1 (7-37)OH were determined to be<br>
between 30 picomoles/liter and about 200 picomoles/liter.<br>
The dose of a PEGylated GLP-1 compound effective to normalize a patient's blood<br>
glucose will depend on a number of factors, among which are included, without limitation,<br>
the subject's sex, weight and age, the severity.of inability to regulate blood glucose, the route<br>
of administration and bioavailability, the pharmacokinetic profile of the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compound, the potency, and the formulation. A typical dose range for the PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compounds of the present invention will range from about 0.01 mg per day to about 1000 mg<br>
per day for an adult. Preferably, the dosage ranges from about 0.1 mg per day to about 100<br>
mg per day, more preferably from about 1.0 mg/day to about 10 mg/day.<br>
It is preferable that the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present invention be<br>
administered either once every two weeks or once a week. Depending on the disease<br>
being treated, it may be necessary to administer the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds more<br>
frequently such as two to three time per week.<br>
A "subject" is a mammal, preferably a human, but can also be an animal,<br>
e.g.. companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows,<br>
sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea<br>
pigs, and the like).<br>
The peptides used to generate the PEGylated GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by using standard methods of solution phase or solid-phase<br>
peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples that are not<br>
intended to be limiting in any way.<br><br><br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a di-PEGylated GLP-1 compound<br>
comprising an amino acid sequence of the formula:<br>
His-Xaa8-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Xaa22-Gln-Ala-Ala-<br>
Lys-Glu-Phe-Ile-Ala-Trp-Leu-Xaa33-Lys-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-Pro-<br>
Cys45-Xaa46 Formula I (SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
wherein Xaa8 is: D-Ala, Gly, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, or Thr;<br>
Xaa22 is: Gly, Glu, Asp, or Lys;<br>
Xaa33 is: Val or Ile;<br>
Xaa46 is: Cys or Cys-NH2;<br>
and wherein one PEG molecule is covalently attached to Cys45 and one PEG molecule is<br>
covalently attached to Cys46 or Cys46-NH2.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - PEGylation of GLP-1 related analogs:<br>
PEGylation reactions are run under conditions that permit the formation of a<br>
thioether bond. Specifically, the pH of the solution ranges from about 4 to 9 and the<br>
thiol-containing peptide concentrations range from 1 to 10 molar excess of methoxy-<br>
PEG2-MAL concentration. The PEGylation reactions are normally run at room<br>
temperature. The PEGylated GLP-1 peptide is then isolated using reverse-phase HPLC<br>
ion exchange chromatography, or size exclusion chromatography (SEC). PEGylated<br>
GLP-1 analogues are characterized using analytical RP-HPLC. HPLC-SEC, SDS-PAGE,<br>
and/or MALDI Mass Spectrometry.<br>
Thiol-containing GLP-1 peptides are reacted with polyethylene glycol-maleimide<br>
(PEG-maleimide) to produce derivatives with PEG covalently attached via a thioether<br>
bond. For example, a GLP-1 compound, 46aa in length; 7.5 mg, 1.8 fimol is dissolved in<br>
2 ml of 200 mM phosphate buffer containing 20 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The solution is then<br>
purged with argon. To this solution is added 40 mg of methoxy-PEG-MAL, a linear or<br>
bifurcated PEG maleimide (Shearwater Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama) (0.55:1<br>
mole/mole ratio of PEG to peptide). The reaction is performed for 2 hours. Then 25 mg<br>
of the PEGylated peptide is purified by RP-HPLC, characterized by size-exclusion<br>
HPLC, and tested for in vitro activity.<br>
Example 2 - 2X20kDa-PEG-maleimide reaction with GLP analogs<br>
GLP-1 analogs are selectively PEGylated at the introduced cysteine residues using<br>
maleimide-activated linear 20 kDa mPEG (NOF, Inc.). For the PEGylation reaction, the<br>
peptide to be PEGylated is dissolved in 100 mM NH4Ac buffer containing lOm.M EDTA<br>
at pH 6.8 and a 1.25-fold molar excess of bulk 20 kDa-mPEG is added. The reaction is<br>
allowed to stir at room temperature for 1-4 hours and SP-Sepharose cation exchange<br>
chromatography is used to separate PEGylated compound from free PEG and free<br>
peptide. The conjugate is desalted by RP-HPLC and lyophilized.<br><br><br>
Example 3 - In vitro activity assay<br>
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using a CRE-<br>
Luciferase system, are seeded at 30,000 cells/well/80 JLXI low serum DMEM F12 medium<br>
into 96 well plates. The day after seeding, 20 µl aliquots of test protein dissolved in 0.5%<br>
BSA are mixed and incubated with the cells for 5 hours. Generally 10 dilutions<br>
containing from 0.00InM. to 10nM are prepared for the test GLP-1 compounds and<br>
0.0003nM and 3nM are prepared for the Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH standard before addition to<br>
the cells to generate a dose response curve from which EC50 values are determined. After<br>
incubation. 100 µl of Luciferase reagent is added directly to each plate and mixed gently<br>
for 2 minutes. Plates are placed in a Tri-lux luminometer and light output resulting from<br>
luciferase expression is calculated. The average EC50 value for PEGylated GLP-1<br>
compound of Formula I, wherein Xaa8 is Val; Xaa22 is Glu; Xaa33 is Ile; and Xaa46 is Cys-<br>
NH2 is 0.36±0.04 nM.<br>
Example 4 - Pharmacokinetic analysis of derivatized GLP-1 peptide<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 compound of Formula I. wherein Xaa8 is Val; Xaa22 is Glu;<br>
Xaa33 is Ile; and Xaa46 is Cys-NH2 is administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous<br>
(SC) routes at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg to male SD rats. The animals (3 rats per group) are<br>
bled at various times between 0 and 192 hours after dosing. Plasma is collected from<br>
each sample and analyzed by N-terminal specific radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters are calculated using model-independent methods (WinNonlin Pro). By IV<br>
administration, the PEGylated GLP-1 analog has an elimination half-life of<br>
approximately 1.2 days while by SC administration the PEGylated GLP-1 analog had an<br>
elimination half-life of approximately 1.1 days. No adverse clinical observations are<br>
associated with IV or SC administration of 0.1 mg/kg. Prolonged elimination half-life,<br>
slow clearance and subcutaneous bioavailability (approximately 30%) are observed for<br>
the compound. Representative data are shown below in Table 1<br><br><br><br>
When Valg-GLP(7-37)OH is similarly IV administered to Fischer 344 rats at a dose of<br>
10 jug/kg, profoundly different clearance and elimination half-life values are obtained as<br>
listed below.<br>
Clearance: 1449 ml/hr/kg<br>
t1/2(hr):	0.05<br>
Example 5 - Pharmacokenetic analysis of derivatized GLP-1 peptide<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 compound of Formula I, wherein Xaa^ is Val; Xaa22 is Glu;<br>
Xaa33 is He; and Xaa46 is Cys-NFF is administered by subcutaneous (SC) route at a dose<br>
of 0.01 mg/kg to male cynomolgus monkeys. The animals are bled at various times<br>
between 0 and 168 hours after dosing. Serum is collected from each sample and analyzed<br>
by N-terminal specific radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated<br>
using model-independent methods (WinNonlin Pro). Representative data are shown<br>
below in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Example 6 - Pharmacodynamic analysis of derivatized GLP-1 peptide<br>
A PEGylated GLP-1 compound of Formula I. wherein Xaas is Val; Xaa22 is Glu;<br>
Xaa33 is Ile; and Xaa46 is Cys-NH2 is administered by subcutaneous (SC) route at a dose<br>
of 0.01 mg/kg to male cynoinolgus monkeys. A stepped intravenous glucose infusion is<br>
conducted immediately after SC administration of vehicle control (phosphate buffered<br>
saline) and 1, 5, and 7 days after SC administration of 0.01 mg/kg PEGylated GLP-1<br>
analog. Stepped intravenous glucose infusion procedures are conducted in sedated<br>
monkeys after a 16-hour fast. Blood samples are drawn at 10 minutes prior to start of<br>
glucose infusion and immediately prior to start of glucose infusion to define baseline. A<br>
stepped infusion of glucose (20% dextrose) is then initiated at a rate of 10 mg/kg/min for<br>
20 minutes followed by an infusion of 25 mg/kg/min for an additional 20 minutes. Blood<br>
samples are taken at 10-minute intervals throughout the infusion period. Insulin levels<br>
are determined by immunoassay. Insulinotropic activity is demonstrated for at least 7<br>
days (relative to placebo; p
