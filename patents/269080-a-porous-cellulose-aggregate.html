DESCRIPTION<br>
POROUS CELLULOSE AGGREGATE AND FORMED PRODUCT COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
            The present invention relates to a porous cellulose aggregate which is mainly useful as an excipient in the field of chemical industry, particularly, in Pharmaceuticals and foods, and a molded product composition thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
            Conventionally, cellulose particles such as crystalline cellulose and powdered cellulose have been widely used as an excipient to prepare molded products containing an active ingredient in the field of pharmaceutical, food and other chemical industries. Good compactibility, flowability and disintegration property are required for these cellulose particles. [0003]<br>
            Patent Document 1 describes porous cellulose particles having crystal form I, pores with a pore size of 0.1 µm or more and a porosity of 20% or more and a fraction of not less than 350 mesh by 90 wt% or more (corresponding to Comparative Example 6 of the present<br><br>
2<br>
application) obtained by mixing cellulose particles with a third ingredient such as a crystalline material insoluble or poorly soluble in water and soluble in an organic solvent, granulating and drying using them or using an aqueous solution of water-soluble organic solvent, subsequently extracting and removing the third ingredient with an organic solvent. Since the porous cellulose particles disclosed in this document form a film-like dense and strong cellulose wall structure formed of primary cellulose particles compacted so uniformly and continuously such that the borders of the particles are indistinct, they completely different from the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention in the particle structure. Although the cellulose particles according to Patent Document 1 are excellent in flowability, the dense and continuous cellulose wall has little water permeability and therefore they do not disintegrate in water, which may pose a problem in quickly releasing the active ingredient. In addition, the cellulose particles according to Patent Document 1 are poor in plastic deformation properties when the cellulose is compressed, the compactibility thereof is insufficient, and the use of an organic solvent and a third ingredient such as a crystalline material soluble in an organic solvent in the production process not only increases the production cost but also may deactivate the active ingredient, and it is not sufficient to be stably used<br><br>
3<br>
as an excipient. [0004]<br>
            Patent Document 2 describes porous fine cellulose particles having crystal form I, a porous structure with a specific surface area of 20 m2/g or more and a pore volume by pores having a diameter not less than 0.01 µm of 0.3 cm3/g or more and an average particle size of at most 100 µm (corresponding to Comparative Example 7 of the present application) obtained by granulating and drying particulate natural cellulose dispersed in an organic solvent by spray-drying method. These fine cellulose particles also have the above-mentioned cellulose wall structure, and are totally different from porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention in the particle structure. Furthermore, although the pore volume of the cellulose particle of Patent Document 2 is large in itself, water is hard to permeate into the particle because the particle structure is different from the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, and therefore it has a problem of poor disintegration property. In addition, this porous cellulose aggregate particle uses an organic solvent in the production process, which not only increases production cost but also results in too large specific surface area and may promote mutual action between the active ingredient and water and deactivate the active ingredient and therefore it was not sufficient to be stably used as an<br><br>
4<br>
excipient. [0005]<br>
            Patent Document 3 describes a cellulose powder having an average polymerization degree of 150-375, an apparent specific volume of 1.84-8.92 cm3/g and a particle size of 300 µm or less (corresponding to Comparative Example 8 of the present application) as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility and disintegration property.<br>
            Patent Document 4 describes a micro-crystalline cellulose aggregate having an average polymerization degree of 60-375, an apparent specific volume of 1.6-3.1 cmVg, an apparent tapping specific volume of 1.4 cm3/g or more and a repose angle of 35-42° and containing 2-80 wt% of ingredients of not less than 200 mesh (corresponding to Comparative Example 9 of the present application) as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility and disintegration property.<br>
            The cellulose powders obtained by Examples described in these Patent Documents have small pore volume within a particle according to pore distribution measurement obtained by mercury porosimetry, and it is completely different from the pore structure which has been intentionally formed as the present invention. On this account, these cellulose powders have a small specific surface area as small as 0.6-1.2 m2/g and low compression compactibility. These Patent Documents disclose controlling compactibility, flowability and<br><br>
5<br>
disintegration property of the cellulose particles by adjusting the value of apparent specific volume but there was a problem that when the apparent specific volume was in a relatively small range of 2.0-2.9 cm3/g, compactibility was not satisfactory although flowability and disintegration property could be excellent whereas when the apparent specific volume was in a slightly increased range of 3.0-3.2 cmVg, flowability and disintegration property deteriorated although compactibility was excellent. [0006]<br>
            Patent Document 5 describes p-l,4-glucan powder having an average particle size of 30 µm at most and a specific surface area of 1.3 m3/g (corresponding to Comparative Example 1 of the present application) as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility. The ?-l,4-glucan powder described in the document does not have secondary aggregate structure and there are contained individual primary particles independently. Although this glucan powder had a good compactibility, it had a problem that it was inferior in disintegration property. In addition, it was poor in flowability because the average particle size was small.<br>
            Patent Document 6 describes, as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility and disintegration property, a cellulose powder having an average polymerization degree of 100-375, acetic acid retention of 280% or more, a value of 0.85-0.90 and b value of<br><br>
6<br>
0.05-0.10 in Kawakita equation (P-V0/(V0-V) = 1/a-b+P/a) , an apparent specific volume of 4.0-6.0 cm3/g and an average particle size of 30-120 µm and containing substantially no particles of 355 µm or more (corresponding to Comparative Example 10 of the present application) obtained by hydrating a cellulose base material. The cellulose powders obtained by Examples in this document have also small pore volume within a particle according to pore distribution measurement obtained by mercury porosimetry, and it is completely different from the pore structure which has been intentionally formed as the present invention. There is a description that cellulose powder of Patent Document 6 is excellent in compression compactibility and disintegration property, but when the repose angle of Examples having the most excellent balance as specifically disclosed was measured, it exceeded 55° and flowability was not sufficiently satisfied, and therefore there was a problem that the variation index of tablet weight became large in a formulation containing a large amount of active ingredient which was poor in flowability, and the homogeneity of the content of pharmacological agents was affected. In addition, when the cellulose powder of this document was molded under high pressure, high hardness could be provided but there arose a problem of delayed degradation since it had no intentionally formed pores within a particle and had little water permeability<br><br>
7<br>
into the inside of the particle. [0007]<br>
            Patent Document 7 describes a crystalline cellulose characterized in that it has an average polymerization degree of 100-375, contains particles which pass a 75-µm screen but remain on a 38-µM screen in an amount of 70 wt% or more of the total weight and has an average ratio of the longer axis to the minor axis of 2.0 or more (corresponding to Comparative Example 11 of the present application) as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility, flowability and disintegration property.<br>
            Patent Document 8 describes a cellulose powder having an average polymerization degree of 150-450, an average L/D (longer axis/minor axis ratio) ratio of 2.0-4.5 for particles of 75 µm or less, an average particle size of 20-250 µm, an apparent specific volume of 4.0-7.0 cm3/g, a repose angle of 54° or less and a specific surface area of 0.5-4 m2/g (corresponding to Comparative Examples 2 and 3 of the present application) as a cellulose powder having a good compactibility, disintegration property and flowability.<br>
            The cellulose powders described in these documents have also small pore volume within a particle measured by mercury porosimetry as mentioned above, and they are completely different from the pore structure which has been intentionally formed as the present<br><br>
8<br>
invention. The cellulose powders described in these documents provide molded products with high hardness by making the shape of a particle elongated. However, since they have elongated shape, the apparent specific volume increases, and the more compactibility increases, the more flowability decreases. When the repose angle was measured for the cellulose powders of Examples described in these documents having the most excellent flowability, it was 44°, when continuous forming at a high rate in a formulation containing a large amount of active ingredient which was poor in flowability, the variation index of tablet weight became large and the homogeneity of the content of pharmacological agents was affected. Therefore the flowability was not satisfied. Furthermore, when the cellulose powders described in these documents were molded under high pressure, high hardness could be provided but there arose a problem of delayed degradation since they had no intentionally formed pores within a particle and had little water permeability into the inside of the particle.<br>
            Although the cellulose powders described in these Patent Documents 5-8 provide a sufficient compactibility as far as the apparent specific volume is in a range of 2.3-6.4 cm3/g, they had a problem that flowability and disintegration property deteriorate. [0008]<br>
Patent Document 9 describes pharmaceutically<br><br>
9<br>
inert spherical seed core containing 10-70% of a crystalline cellulose having an average polymerization degree of 60-375 and 10-90% of a water-soluble additive as a cellulose powder having a good flowability. Patent Document 10 describes pharmaceutically inert spherical nucleus containing 50% or more of a crystalline cellulose having a water absorption power of 0.5-1.5 ml/g, a sphericity of 0.7 or more, an apparent tapping specific volume of 0.65 g/ml or more, an abrasion degree of 1% or less and an average polymerization degree of 60-375 (corresponding to Comparative Example 12 of the present application) obtained by kneading a powder containing 50% or more of a crystalline cellulose with distilled water in a mixing and stirring granulating machine while mixing. Patent Document 11 describes a microcrystalline cellulose powder having a nondense density of at least 0.4 g/cm3 (2.5 cm3/g in terms of apparent specific volume), a spherical shape, an average particle size of 5-35 µm and a smooth surface obtained by mechanically reducing the particle size of hydrolyzed cellulose particles and performing spray drying. Patent Document 12 describes cellulose particles containing 10% or more of a crystalline cellulose having an average polymerization degree of 60-350, an apparent tapping specific volume of 0.60-0.95 g/ml, a sphericity of 0.7 or more, a shape factor of 1.10-1.50 and an average particle size of 10-400 µm (corresponding to<br><br>
10<br>
Comparative Example 13 of the present application) obtained by hydrolyzing a cellulose base material so that the average polymerization degree may be 60-350 and then mechanically grinding it until the average particle size may be 15 µm and drying a dispersion containing the resulted crystalline cellulose in the form of droplets. [0009]<br>
            The cellulose particles described in these publications do not take secondary aggregate structures and the cellulose particles obtained by the method described in these patent documents have an apparent specific volume of 2.5 cm3/g or less, a shape near a sphere and an excellent flowability but they are inferior in compression compactibility and cannot be molded products having practically sufficient hardness under a commonly used compression pressure of 10-20 MPa.<br>
            As stated above, compactibility, flowability and disintegration property are properties incompatible to each other in cellulose particles of the prior art and realization of a cellulose particle having all of these physical properties in a good balance have been<br>
desired.<br>
            In the meantime, since the cellulose particles described in Patent Documents 3-12 do not have intentionally formed pores within a particle and the volume of the pores within a particle is small, they can hardly carry an active ingredient within a<br><br>
11<br>
particle and there were problems of liquid exudation at the time of compression shaping and troubles in tableting. On the other hand, the cellulose particles described in Patent Documents 1 and 2 have pores within a particle but due to small pore diameter they had a problem that water is hard to permeate into the dense and continuous cellulose wall and therefore they do not disintegrate in water- and may cause problems for rapid release of the active ingredient.<br>
            In addition, since these cellulose particles do not have intentionally formed pores within a particle and the volume of the pores within a particle is small and they can hardly carry an active ingredient within a particle, they have shortcomings that they release the active ingredient so slowly that they cannot be practically used in a solid formulation of a poorly water-soluble active ingredient unless they are subjected to a complicated process comprising once granulating with water and/or an organic solvent followed by drying and that in the case of a solid formulation of a sublimating active ingredient, the active ingredient may be recrystallized during storage and deteriorates the commercial value. [0010]<br>
            An active ingredient in a solid formulation for internal application elutes from a drug into body fluid in digestive organs and the active ingredient is absorbed by digestive organs, enters to systemic<br><br>
12<br>
circulation blood to show the drug efficacy. Because dissolution of poorly water-soluble active ingredient is low, it may be excreted before the administered active ingredient dissolves entirely and exhibits sufficient efficacy. The ratio of the amount of the entire active ingredient which enters the systemic circulation blood to the amount of the administered active ingredient is generally known as bioavailability. Various kinds of methods for improving the dissolution of poor solubility active ingredient have been examined conventionally aiming for improvement of the bioavailability and fast-acting of the active ingredient.<br>
            Patent Document 13 describes a method of co-pulverizing the poorly water-soluble active ingredient with ?-l,4-glucan powder. Since the pulverizing treatment must be continued for an extended period of time until the crystallinity of ?-l,4-glucan powder disappeared and strong shearing force must be continuously imposed for a long time with an abrasive roll mixer, this method had a problem that it is inefficient in the actual production. In addition, there was a problem that the (3-1,4-glucan which lost crystallinity had a low compression compactibility.<br>
            Patent Document 14 describes a method of blending ?-l,4-glucan, a disintegrator and a surfactant for producing a solid preparation to be orally administered from a poorly water-soluble pharma-<br><br>
13<br>
cological agent by direct tableting method so as to enhance the strength and eliminate variation of the content of the principal agent and to promote degree of degradation of a tablet and dissolution rate of the principal agent. This publication did not mention about pores within a particle and it was not known at all to improve water-solubility of a pharmacological agent by blending a poorly water-soluble active ingredient with porous cellulose particles. In addition, it is needed to blend a surfactant in order to promote dissolution of a poorly water-soluble active ingredient and there remained a problem to be solved that inflammation was caused on the mucous membrane of digestive organs by the surfactant when the solid preparation was administered. [0011]<br>
            Patent Document 15 describes that when tablets are produced using a poorly water-soluble principal agent and ?-l,4-glucan by wet tableting method going through the steps of powder mixing, kneading, granulating and drying, tablets having a high tablet hardness, a short disintegration time and a high dissolution rate of the principal agent are produced by adding a water-soluble polymer solution. This publication did not mention about porous cellulose particles having large pores within a particle and it was not known at all to improve water-solubility of a pharmacological agent by blending a poorly water-<br><br>
14<br>
soluble active ingredient with porous cellulose particles. In addition, a number of steps relating to drying oil adsorbed materials are essential in such a process, and facilities cost incurred by the process and high energy cost for drying are problems to be solved. Furthermore, there were other problems to be solved such that the process cannot be applied to active ingredients which are deactivated by heat.<br>
            In addition, Patent Document 16 describes a method for improving dissolution of a pharmacological agent by mixing a poorly soluble pharmacological agent with cellulose particles with porous structure having a particular specific surface area and pore volume and allowing the former to be sublimated and adsorbed onto the latter which is obtained by dispersing particulate natural cellulose in an organic solvent and granulating and drying it by spray-dry method. The porous cellulose particles described in the document have a high specific surface area and a large pore volume and therefore improvement in dissolution is surely observed when the poorly water-soluble active ingredient is sublimated and adsorbed. However, there is a problem of storage stability in the Examples of this patent document, in which cellulose particles having an excessively high specific surface area are used and the active ingredient sublimated and adsorbed on the surface is amorphous, that the active ingredient partially crystallizes during storage which may change<br><br>
15<br>
dissolution rate, etc. and further, they had shortcomings that a strongly-bonded molded product composition such as a tablet was hard to collapse due to poor disintegration property and the active ingredient was slow to be eluted.<br>
            Sublimable active ingredients have a problem that they exude from the solid preparation during storage and most of these solid preparations have been subjected to film coating or sugarcoating for the purpose of preventing the problem. However, even when such measures was taken, there remained problems that the active ingredient passes through the film layer and goes out of the product, which causes variation of the active ingredient in the preparation, adheres onto the surface of the preparation to cause irritating odor at the time of taking a drug, and recrystallizes within a storage container such as a bottle to significantly reduce the commercial value. In the case of an uncoated preparation, sublimation recrystallization becomes more remarkable compared with a coated preparation.<br>
            As already mentioned, since Patent Document 16 used cellulose particles having an excessively high specific surface area and the active ingredient sublimated and adsorbed on the surface thereof has become amorphous, there were problems that storage stability of active ingredient was poor and shortcomings that a strongly-bonded molded product<br><br>
16<br>
composition such as a tablet was hard to collapse due to poor disintegration property and the active ingredient was slow to be eluted. [0012]<br>
            In addition, Patent Document 17 describes, as a method for preventing recrystallization of ibuprofen in a solid preparation due to sublimation, a method of storing an ibuprofen-containing solid preparation along with one or two or more stabilizing substances selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium oxide and sodium hydrogen carbonate in a closed container such as a bottle. According to such a method, adhesion of crystals to a closed container during storage of the preparation and irritating odor of the preparation are surely alleviated, but it is necessary to put polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium oxide, sodium carbonate, etc. in the container as a different preparation, and the process becomes complicated. Therefore, this is utterly different from the preparation containing a sublimable active ingredient of the present invention which provides a single preparation in which sublimation is prevented by putting porous cellulose in the preparation.<br>
            Conventionally, a composition containing an active ingredient which is oily, liquid or semisolid at normal temperature causes oozing of a liquid ingredient from the preparation when compressed and shaped and therefore it is more likely to cause troubles in<br><br>
17<br>
tableting in particular as compared with a solid active ingredient and also has problems of causing spots of the liquid ingredient on the surface of the resulted preparation, flowability defectiveness in the case of a granular preparation, and the like. These problems do not only reduce commercial value significantly but also cause variation of concentration and/or efficacy of the active ingredient and therefore improvement thereof is extremely important. [0013]<br>
            Patent Documents 18-29 describe a method of holding an active ingredient which is liquid or semisolid at normal temperature as it is onto the adsorbing carrier or holding an active ingredient which has been dissolved, emulsified or suspended in water, an organic solvent, oils and fats, a water-soluble polymer or a surfactant followed by a drying step and compressing and forming the resulted dry powder or granulated powder. However, the active ingredient which is liquid or semisolid at normal temperature may ooze at the time of compression and cause troubles in tableting and sufficiently compressed molded product may not be obtained. In addition, these Patent Documents do not mention about pore volume within a particle with regard to cellulose particles, and it has not been known at all that when the active ingredient which is liquid or semisolid at normal temperature is compressed, addition of porous cellulose aggregate<br><br>
18<br>
having a large pore volume within a particle of the present invention will prevent oozing by holding the active ingredient which is liquid or semisolid at normal temperature within the particles of the porous cellulose aggregate and facilitate the production of a solid preparation such as powder, granulate and tablet. In addition, a number of steps relating to drying are essential in the processes of Patent Documents 18-29, and facilities cost incurred by the processes and high energy cost for drying are problems to be solved.<br>
            As a method of mixing crystalline cellulose and an active ingredient to enhance mixing homogeneity of the active ingredient and reduce the variation of active ingredient, Patent Document 30 discloses a method of mixing a pharmacological agent and talc, light quality silicic anhydride, silicon dioxide hydrate, stearate as a fluidizing agent followed by mixing the mixed powder with other additives in mixing of a pharmacological agent and additives and describes that crystalline cellulose is excellent in miscibility among additives other than the fluidizing agent. However, there was no description at all about pores within a particle of cellulose such as crystalline cellulose, and it has not been known that the mixing homogeneity of an active ingredient can be improved by blending porous cellulose aggregate particles to hold the active ingredient within the particles as in the present invention. This document also describes that<br><br>
19<br>
the method is preferably applied to a highly aggregating pharmacological agent which is in the form of a fine powder having an average particle size of 40 µm or less to exhibit the effect significantly but the smallest particle size of the pharmacological agent actually described in the Examples of the document is 16 µm and as for the particles pulverized to 10 µm or less for the purpose of enhancing the dispersibility at the time of dosing a poorly water-soluble active ingredient, for example, aggregating properties of the active ingredient were markedly increased and there was a case where sufficient mixing homogeneity was not achieved for conventional crystalline cellulose in which the pore within a particle was small (Comparative Example 31 of the present invention).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0077]<br>
            Fig. 1 is a graph of pore distribution of the porous cellulose aggregate A (Example 1) of the present invention measured by mercury porosimetry. A "clear peak" coming from pores within a particle in 0.1-10 µm in the pore distribution was confirmed from Fig. 1. This is almost the same as the pore diameter shown in an electron microgram by SEM. Another peak shown in 10-50 µm in Fig. 1 comes from spaces among particles;<br>
            Fig. 2 is a graph of pore distribution of the cellulose powder K (Comparative Example 3) measured by mercury porosimetry. A "clear peak" seen in the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention was not<br><br>
25<br>
confirmed. Pores without "clear peak" are those which the original primary cellulose particles have. Another peak seen in 10-50 µm was due to the spaces among particles in consideration of powder particle size distribution;<br>

            Fig. 4 is an electron microgram of the cellulose particle N (Comparative Example 6) in 250-fold magnification. It can be seen from the photograph that the particle structure of cellulose particle N is not a "secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles" but a "continuous and strong film-like cellulose partition" so that the border of primary particles is inarticulate since the primary cellulose particle is finely divided, and the finely divided particles bond to each other strongly at the time of drying;<br>
Fig. 5 is an electron microgram of the<br>
cellulose powder P (Comparative Example 8) in 250-fold magnification. It can be seen from the photograph that the particle structure of "cellulose powder P is a "secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles" but since it was prepared by drying a dispersion of cellulose particles having a single<br><br>
26<br>
average particle size, pore volume within a particle was small, and as a result of measuring pore distribution by mercury porosimetry, "a clear peak" in 0.1-10 µm in pore distribution was not confirmed;<br>
            Fig. 6 is an electron microgram of the cellulose particle A (Example 1) in 1500-fold magnification. "The secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles" was confirmed by the photograph, and boundary among primary particles was observed definitely;<br>
            Fig. 7 is an electron microgram of the cellulose particle N (Comparative Example 6) in 1500-fold magnification. It can be seen from the photograph that the partition is in the form of a film and boundary among primary particles is indistinct;<br>

            Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional electron microgram of a particle of the cellulose powder P (Comparative Example 8). A closely bonded structure in which cellulose particles bond to each other rigidly is confirmed.

            Fig. 10 is a graph showing relations between repose angle and hardness for the cellulose particles A to H in Examples 1 to 8 and cellulose powders or the cellulose particles I to U in Comparative Example 1 to 13 (hardness of columnar molded product prepared by weighing 0.5 g for each and forming columnar molded product of ? 1.1 cm by compression pressure of 20 MPa) . As for Examples 1 to 8, the hardness is 165N or more even if the repose angle is less than 44° and it can be seen that they are excellent in the balance of flow ability and compactibility. In contrast, as for Comparative Examples 1 to 13, those having hardness of 165N or more cannot be obtained for the repose angle of less than 44°, and when those having hardness of 165N or more can be obtained, the repose angle is 44° or more, and therefore, it can be seen that the balance of flowability and compactibility is poor. There were no products having a hardness by 20 Mpa of 165N or more and repose angle of less than 44° and thus being excellent in compactibility and flowability as in the present invention in the whole usable range of the apparent specific volume as an excipient, for example, 2.0-6 cm3/g; and<br>
            Fig. 11 is a graph showing relations between hardness and disintegration for the cellulose particles A to H in Examples 1 to 8 and cellulose powders or the cellulose particles I to U in Comparative Example 1 to 13 (hardness and disintegration of columnar molded<br><br>
28<br>
product prepared by weighing 0.5 g for each and forming columnar molded product of ? 1.1 cm by compression pressure of 20 MPa). As for Examples 1 to 8, the disintegration time is 75 seconds or less in the entire region of hardness ranging from 160N to 400N and therefore, it can be seen that the balance of hardness and disintegration is excellent. In contrast, as for Comparative Examples 1 to 13, some systems show extreme delay in disintegration when the hardness increases and there were no examples with disintegration time of 75 seconds or less for 160N or more. There were no products having a hardness by 20 Mpa of 165N or more and disintegration time of 75 seconds or less and thus being excellent in compactibility and disintegration property as an excipient as in the present invention in the whole usable range of the apparent specific volume, for example, 2.0-6.0 cm3/g.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0018]<br>
            The present invention is specifically described below, in particular, focused on the preferable embodiments.<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has to have the secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles. This refers to a secondary aggregate structure in which borders among primary particles are clear when the<br><br>
29<br>
particle surface is observed at 250- and/or 1500-fold magnification in scanning electron microscope (SEM). The secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles is closely related to disintegration property and the case not having this particle structure is not preferable because the disintegration property turns worse. When the borders of primary particles are not clear, for example, the case where there is a film-shaped compact and continuous cellulose partition is not preferable, because the primary cellulose particles continue compactly and are bonded strongly, and particles do not disintegrate in water and the disintegration property of the molded product deteriorates.<br>
In addition, the secondary aggregate<br>
structure formed by aggregation of primary particles is not only related to disintegration property but also closely related to dissolution characteristics of the active ingredient. As for porous cellulose particles having the secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles, penetration of water in among the primary particles is fast and disintegration to primary particles is promoted in water and when they hold an active ingredient, they are effective in improving dissolution characteristics of poorly soluble in water active ingredient since the contacting area of the active ingredient with water increases.<br><br>
30<br>
            In addition, this secondary aggregate structure is distributed uniformly regardless of inside/surface of the particle, and when mixed with an active ingredient, space among the primary cellulose particles can hold the active ingredient and particularly it can prevent oozing of a liquid ingredient, and thus it is preferable.<br>
            Furthermore, this secondary aggregate structure can hold the active ingredient not only on the surface of the particles but also inside thereof and therefore it contributes to improvement in mixing rate of the active ingredient and improvement in mixing homogeneity, and can largely reduce density variation, and thus it is preferable. [0019]<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, pore volume within a particle has to be 0.265 cm3/g to 2.625 cm3/g. Because the porous particle having a large pore volume within a particle is excellent in plastic deformation properties, and the particle is easy to be collapsed at the time of compression, it is excellent in compactibility. The<br>
porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has intentionally increased pore volume of aggregated particles as well as the pore volume derived from original cellulose and plastic deformation properties has been increased by changing the structure of particle itself in this way. Therefore it shows high<br><br>
31<br>
compression compactibility regardless of the apparent specific volume of the particle. In the case where the pore volume within a particle is less than 0.265 cm3/g, because there are only pores within a particle which the primary cellulose particle inheres or pores within a particle formed naturally by aggregation of cellulose and not those intentionally formed, it is poor in plastic deformation properties. Because the apparent specific volume of a particle has to be increased to enhance compactibility, as a result, flowability of a particle becomes poor. As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, good compactibility can be secured for relatively small appearance specific volume, and as a result, aggregate also excellent in flowability can be obtained. [0020]<br>
When pore volume within a particle is<br>
0.265 cm3/g or more, sufficient pore volume is provided within a particle, and active ingredient once taken in the particle or pores on the particle surface in a mixing process and a compression process is hard to dissociate and sufficient amount of the liquid ingredient can be held in pores within a particle, and accordingly, it is excellent in preventing oozing and thus it is preferable, and when a solid active ingredient is used, it can uniformly hold a large amount of finely pulverized active ingredient for the purpose of improving water-dispersibility and a<br><br>
32<br>
dissolution characteristic, and can prevent recrystallization of a sublimable active ingredient, particularly during storage and can contribute to stabilization and prevention of lowering of commercial value and thus it is preferable and, besides, it can contribute improvement in mixing rate of an active ingredient, improvement in mixing homogeneity and largely reduce density variation and thus it is preferable. When a poorly water-soluble active ingredient once dissolved, suspended or emulsified is used, it is excellent in holding properties of a liquid ingredient and thus it is preferable. It is preferable that the coefficient of variance of drug level, which is an index of density variation of an active ingredient, can be lowered to 3.0% or less in the mixing time, and preferably 2.0% or less, particularly preferably 1.5% or less. Particularly when an active ingredient having an average particle size of 10 µm or less and having very high aggregation characteristics is mixed, the use of particles having pore volume within a particle of 0.265 cm3/g or more as defined in the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention provides an effect of holding the active ingredient not only on the surface but also inside of the particles and thereby allowing to lower the coefficient of the variance of the drug level and thus it is preferable.<br>
            Pore volume within a particle less than 0.265 cm3/g is not preferable because in that case, dispersion<br><br>
33<br>
homogeneity and holding properties of a solid active ingredient and a liquid active ingredient are deteriorated, which causes variation of the concentration of the active ingredient, aggregation in the solid preparation, deterioration of compression compactibility, recrystallization during storage in the case of a sublimable active ingredient and reduction of stability and commercial value, and the effects mentioned above cannot be provided and thus it is not preferable. When the pore volume within a particle exceeds 2.625 cm3/g, apparent specific volume bulk increases and flowability deteriorates, and thus it is not preferable. [0021]<br>
            The pore size distribution of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention is measured, for example, by mercury porosimetry. Particularly, it is preferable that a "clear peak" can be recognized in a range of 0.1-10 µm. In addition, the central pore diameter which is the peak top of pore distribution is closely related with penetration of water into the particle, and the center pore diameter of 0.3 µm or more is preferable. When the central pore diameter is 0.3 µm or more, penetration speed of water increases, and disintegration property is further improved. The larger the central pore diameter is, the more preferable, but it is at most on the order of 5 µm in consideration of the distribution range.<br><br>
34<br>
            Crystal form of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention must be type I. Type I,type II,type III,type IV, etc. are known for a crystal form of cellulose, and particularly among them, type I is called "natural cellulose" and type II is called "regenerated cellulose" and used for general-purpose, but type III and type IV are obtained only in a laboratory scale and not commonly used in an industry scale. Natural cellulose is used for food as a vegetable fiber from ancient times, and now it is widely used as a dispersion stabilizer of a liquid food product and a drug excipient. On the other hand, a regenerated cellulose is regenerated by removing a solution of chemicals such as carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide and a solvent and changing the crystallographic structure, and is partially used as a shape retaining agent for food products in wet process. Type II crystal, a regenerated cellulose, is not preferable because the particles become rigid due to the change in the crystal form from natural cellulose of type I, and plastic deformation properties at the time of compression decrease, and molded products cannot be provided with sufficient hardness. [0022]<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, it is necessary that the average particle size is more than 30 µm and 250 µm or less. When the average particle size is 30 µm or less,<br><br>
35<br>
cellulose particles aggregate, and when it is mixed with an active ingredient, the active ingredient is hard to disperse uniformly, and variation of the active ingredient in an obtained molded product tends to increase, and weight variation of the molded products also tends to increase when produced in series. In addition, separation segregation is readily caused when a formulated powder mixed with an active ingredient having a poor flowability is consecutively compressed, in the case that the average particle size is more than 250 µm.<br>
            The specific surface area of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has to be 1.3 m2/g to 20 m2/g. When the specific surface area is less than 1.3 m2/g, the compression shaping properties deteriorates and high hardness and low abrasion are hard to be provided to the molded product. In addition, in the case that the specific surface area is more than 20 m2/g, the contacting area between a cellulose and an active ingredient tends to grow excessively large when blended with an active ingredient which is readily deactivated by a cellulose, which is not preferable because it makes the active ingredient more easily deactivated.<br>
            The repose angle of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has to be 25° more and less than 44°. An active ingredient is usually prepared so that it may quickly spread in gastric fluid<br><br>
36<br>
and/or intestinal fluid media and increase efficacy when administered, and it is often pulverized or originally fine particles. Because they are fine powder, a flow property is poor, but the repose angle of a cellulose powder more than 44° is not preferable in the point of flowability of the case where a poorly flowable active ingredient is blended in a large amount. Weight variation of a molded product particular in high-speed compression of several thousands to several ten thousands tablets/hour tends to be large. The smaller the repose angle is, the better the flowability is, but 25-42° is particularly excellent. More preferably it is 25-40°. The repose angle less than 25° is not preferable in the point of separation segregation from the active ingredient. [0023]<br>
            The apparent specific volume of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has to be 2.0-6.0 cm3/g. Since the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a porous structure, it has hardness, flowability and disintegration property in a good balance over the almost whole area of the apparent specific volume as compared with conventional products. It is preferable that the apparent specific volume is 2.0 cm3/g or more to give high compression compactibility and 6.0 cm3/g or less to give high flowability. Particularly preferably, it is 2.5-5.0 cm3/g.<br><br>
37<br>
            It is preferable that the quantity of anchoring water of the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention is 0.01 g or more measured by DSC. It is said that there are three kinds of water, i.e., free water, anchoring water and nonfreezing water in a cellulose particle. Free water and anchoring water shown here are shown by peak area of near 0°C and peak area of -30 to 40°C measured by differential scanning calorie analysis (DSC)(With DSC7 manufactured by PERKIN ELMER, measured at measurement temperature of -50 to 30°C and temperature increasing rate of 10°C), and nonfreezing water corresponds to the one which does not appear as a peak in DSC and corresponds to the difference by subtracting free water and anchoring water from the total moisture quantity measured by Karl Fisher method. Because the compression compactibility increases as the anchoring water increases, and thus it is preferable, and the upper limit thereof is not particularly limited. The amount of the anchoring water is preferably 0.15 g or more, and more preferably 0.20 g or more. [0024]<br>
            It is preferable that the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a surface free energy (ysd) of 65 mJ/m2 or less measured by inverse gas chromatograph (IGC: the product of Surface Measurement System Ltd., 303K, relative humidity 0%). It is said that cellulose particles have surface free energy on<br><br>
38<br>
the particle surface. The surface free energy is a parameter expressing surface appearance of a particle calculated by retention time when a sample is fed into an IGC column, and organic solvent gases different in polarity such as decane, nonane, octane, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol and methane are passed through the column, and it can be expressed as y3d obtained by the following formula: [Formula 1]<br><br>
Wherein each symbol in the above formula is<br>
respectively represents as follows:<br>
R: Gas constant (Jmol-1K-1) ,<br>
T: Column temperature (K),<br>
VR°: Retention volume (cm3) of gas,<br>
N: Avogadro constant (mol-1) ,<br>
y3d: Surface free energy (mJm-2) of a particle,<br>
a: Molecule cross-section area (cm2) of an adsorption<br>
ingredient,<br>
yLdy: Surface tension of an adsorption ingredient in the<br>
liquid state;<br>
and the surface free energy ysd can be expressed as a<br>
slope when RTlnVR° (kJ/mol): measured value and<br>
a(ysd) 1/2(m2/ (J/ m2) 1/2) : pre-determined value are plotted.<br><br>
39<br>
            Particularly preferably, the surface free energy is 60 mJ/m2 or less. This surface free energy contributes to flowability of a cellulose particle and the smaller, the better. The lower limit is not limited in particular. [0025]<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, it is preferable that the hardness of columnar molded products to be obtained by weighing 0.5 g of cellulose powder, putting it in a mortar (manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho, Ltd. using materials SUS2,3), and compressing it with a round plane mallet of a diameter of 1.1 cm (manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho, Ltd. using materials SUS2,3) until the pressure reaches 10 MPa and 20 Mpa (manufactured by Aikoh Engineering with PCM-1A, compression velocity of 1 cm/min) under a condition of holding it by the aimed pressures for 10 seconds is 60N or more and 165 N or more, respectively. When the hardness at 10 MPa is less than 60 N or the hardness at 20 MPa is less than 165 N under respective conditions, the hardness of the molded products produced by blending an active ingredient in a large amount and under condition of several ten thousands to several hundred thousands tablets/hour is low, and troubles in tableting such as abrasion or capping tend to occur. The higher the tablet hardness shown here is, the better, but the hardness for 10 Mpa is 160 N and the hardness for 20<br><br>
                               40 MPa is 450 N at most.<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, the case where hardness of columnar molded products to be obtained by compressing until the above-mentioned pressure reaches 20 Mpa is 165-410 N, preferably 200-410 N, is particularly excellent.<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, it is preferable that disintegration time of a columnar molded product obtained by compressing till 20 MPa by the method mentioned above under a condition of holding it by the aimed pressure for 10 seconds is 75 seconds or less at a point of disintegration property. Particularly preferably it is 50 seconds or less. The shorter the disintegration time is, the better. An active ingredient is usually prepared so that it may spread in gastric fluid and/or intestinal fluid media and quickly increase efficacy when administered, but when the disintegration time of molded product is longer, dissolution of a pharmacological agent from the molded product takes time and it is not absorbed in digestive organs immediately and the immediate effect tends to decrease. [0026]<br>
            As for the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, it is preferable that 200 mg weight of molded products to be obtained by putting 55 parts by weight of acetaminophen (product made by API Co., Ltd., a powder type), 0.25 part by weight of light<br><br>
41<br>
silicic anhydride (manufactured by NIPPON AEROSIL CO., LTD, trade name, AEROSIL 200), 27 part by weight of cellulose particle, 2 part by weight of crospovidone (manufactured by BASF, trade name, Kollidon CL) and 15 parts by weight of granulated lactose (manufactured by Lactose New Zealand, trade name, Super-Tab) in a 100 L scale V-type mixer (manufactured by dalton Corporation, mixing for 30 minutes, and subsequently adding 0.5 part by weight of magnesium stearate (Taihei Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., derived from plant) and further mixing for 5 minutes to obtain a formulated powder, and punching the formulated powder in a rotary tablet machine (Kikusui Seisakusho, Ltd., trade name, LIBRA-II, rotating plate ? 410 mm for 36 mallets) using a mallet having a diameter of 8 mm, 12R, under the turning table rotation of 50 rpm, compressive force 7.5 kN, have a hardness of 50 N or more, and abrasion degree of less than 1%, and do not troubles in tableting.<br>
            An excipient with high compactibility is necessary to give hardness to a formulation containing a poorly formable pharmacological agent in a large amount and to reduce abrasion degree, and when consecutive forming is made at a high-speed, an excipient with high flowability is necessary to reduce weight variation. Such a production of a molded product with a formulation containing a poorly formable pharmacological agent in a large amount and at high speed punching is first brought to be realized by<br><br>
42<br>
blending an excipient excellent in compactibility and excellent in flowability as in the present invention. When the hardness of the molded product is less than 50 N, or the abrasion degree is 1% or more, abrasion, flying powder, crack and chip may occur during transportation, and thus it is not preferable. When troubles in tableting occur, they lead to a production of defective products, and thus it is not preferable. The higher the hardness shown here is, the better, but it is 100 N at most, and the lower the abrasion degree is, the better. [0027]<br>
            The production process of the cellulose powder of the present invention is described below.<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention can be obtained by drying a dispersion containing two or more cellulose dispersion particle groups having different average particle sizes and a liquid medium wherein the average particle sizes of the cellulose dispersion particles are 1 to 110 µm.<br>
            The cellulose dispersion particle groups as used in the present invention consist of natural cellulosic materials.<br>
            A natural cellulosic material is derived from either plant or animal, and for example, a fibrous material derived from natural product which contains cellulose such as wood, bamboo, straw, rice straw, cotton, ramie, bagasse, kenaf, beat, sea squirt,<br><br>

bacterial cellulose, and it is preferable to have a crystalline structure of cellulose type I. As raw materials, one kind of natural cellulosic material of the above can be used or a mixture of two or more of them can be used, either. It is preferable to use it in the form of purified pulp, but there is no particular limitation in the purification method of pulp, and dissolving pulp, kraft pulp, NBKP pulp or any pulps may be used. A natural cellulosic material may be a raw material such as hydrolyzed pulp or non-hydrolyzed pulp. Paticularly, when it is hydrolyzed, hydrolysis may be acid hydrolysis, alkali oxidative degradation, hydrothermal degradation, steam explosion or the like. Any one of them or combination thereof may be used. [0028]<br>
            As a medium using in the above production process where the medium is used to disperse solid contents in a suitable medium afterwards, water is preferable, but there is no particular limitation as far as it can be used industrially and, for example, water and/or an organic solvent may be used. Examples of organic solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butyl alcohol, 2-methylbutyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, ketones such as acetone, ethyl methyl ketone. Particularly, it is preferably to use organic solvents which is used for a pharmaceutical<br><br>
44<br>
products, and includes those classified as a solvent in "Iyakuhin Tenkabutsu Jiten" (Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Additives) (published by YAKUJI NIPPO LIMITED.). Either water or organic solvent alone or combinations of two or more of them may be used, or after the ingredient is dispersed in a medium, the medium may be removed and then the ingredient may be dispersed in another medium. [0029]<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention can be obtained by drying a cellulose dispersion containing two or more cellulose dispersion particle groups having different average particle sizes. There is no particular limitation on the average particle size of each cellulose dispersion particle group, but 1-110 µm is preferable. According to the present invention, it is only required that two or more cellulose dispersion particle groups having different average particle sizes within this average particle size range should be contained and those having any average particle sizes may be blended unless each of them has a same average particle size. For example, when two kinds of cellulose dispersion particle groups having different average particle sizes are mixed, it is preferable that the larger one has an average particle size of 10-110 µm and the smaller one has an average particle size of 0.005-0.99 times the average particle size of the larger one. More preferably, it<br><br>
45<br>
is preferable that the smaller one has an average particle size of 0.01-0.8 times the average particle size of the larger one. Most preferably, it is preferable that the smaller one has an average particle size of 0.01-0.7 times the average particle size of the larger one.<br>
            By mixing two or more cellulose dispersion particle groups having different average particle sizes can provide a large pore volume within a particle. When the cellulose dispersion is dried, cellulose dispersion particles having a smaller average particles diameter enter among the cellulose dispersion particle ingredient having a larger average particles diameter, and contribute to inhibiting an excessive aggregation among cellulose dispersion particles having a larger average particle size, and take a secondary aggregate structure comprising each of them as primary particles.<br>
            The weight ratio of the cellulose particle group having a larger average particle size to the cellulose particle group having a smaller average particle size, depends on the purpose, is usually preferable within a range of 5/95-95/5. More preferably, within 10/90-90/10, and more preferably within 20/80-80/20. The value of pore volume of the present invention can be controlled by selecting a suitable weight ratio. [0030]<br>
In addition, as for the particle shape of the<br><br>
46<br>
cellulose particle composition having a larger average particle size mentioned above, those having a ratio (L/D) of the each average value of the major and minor diameters of 2.0 or more are preferably used. The larger L/D is, the more profound effect to inhibit excessive particle aggregation at the time of drying exerts. Therefore the large 40 contributes to providing a large pore volume within a particle.<br>
            There is no particular limitation on the process for obtaining a dispersion from a cellulose particle composition having two or more different average particle sizes as mentioned above. Each of the processes: i) a process comprising preparing each of plural cellulose particle compositions having different average particle size separately, and mixing these plural cellulose particle dispersions; ii) a process comprising treating a part of one cellulose particle composition to prepare one having different average particle size and mixing them; and iii) a process comprising fractionating a cellulose particle compositions having one average particle size, treating each portion respectively to prepare those having different average particle size respectively and mixing them. One kind of the production processes i-iii) may be used alone, or two kinds or more of them may be optionally used together. The treatment process performed here may be a wet process or a dry process, and those respectively obtained by wet processes may be<br><br>
47<br>
mixed together before drying, those respectively obtained by dry processes may be mixed together before drying or those respectively obtained by a wet process or a dry process may be combined. There is no particular limitation on the process including well-known methods, and for example, grinding and/or pulverizing may be performed and classification using a screen, centrifugal separation using a cyclone or centrifuge may be used, and even a method which put them together may be applied. [0031]<br>
            Grinding method may be a grinding method using agitation blade such as one-direction rotation type, multi-axis rotation type, reciprocal inversion type, vertical movement type, rotation+ vertical movement type, piping type such as a portable mixer, a three-dimensional mixer, a side-wall mixer, jet type agitation grinding method such as a line mixer, grinding methods using a high shear homogenizer, high pressure homogenizer, a supersonic wave homogenizer, and a grinding method using an axial rotation extruder, for example, a kneader. Pulverizing method may be any method including a screen-type pulverizing method such as a screen mill and a hammer mill, blade rotation shear screen type pulverizing method such as a flush mill, air stream type pulverizing method such as a jet mill, ball type pulverizing methods such as a ball mill and a vibratory ball mill, a blade agitation type<br><br>
                               48 pulverizing method, etc.<br>
            It is preferable that cellulose dispersion particle aggregate obtained by an operation as above is made into a dispersion having a concentration of 5-40 wt% before drying. When this concentration is less than 5 wt%, the average particle size of the obtained cellulose particle is so small that self-flowability tends to be impaired. In addition, when this concentration exceeds 40 wt%, apparent specific volume of the cellulose particle is so small that compression compactibility tends to be impaired. Preferably it is 10-40 wt%, and more preferably it is 15-40 wt%. [0032]<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the<br>
average particle size of cellulose dispersion particles existing in the above cellulose fluid dispersion having a concentration of 5-40 wt% is 1-110 µm. When the average particle size exceeds 110 µm, the cellulose particles after drying grows excessively large, and depending on a kind of the active ingredient, there are cases to cause separation segregation when mixed with it. On the other hand, when the average particle size is less than 1 µm, the cellulose particle after drying is excessively small and it is hard to keep good flowability. Preferably it is 5-90 µm, and more preferably it is 10-80 µm. The average particle size as used here can be determined by technique generally used for volume particle size distribution measurement<br><br>
49<br>
measured with, for example, an optical laser diffraction-type particle size distribution meter (manufactured by HORIBA, trade name, LA-910 type).<br>
            The above average particle size can be controlled into a desired range by adjusting polymerization degree of raw material cellulose by hydrolysis and hydrolysis of cellulose and/or agitation force at a dispersion step. Generally when the acid concentration or the alkali concentration, reaction temperature of hydrolysis solution is increased, there is a tendency that the cellulose polymerization degree decreases and the cellulose average dispersion particle size of the dispersion decreases; and when the agitation force in a solution is strengthened, there is a tendency that the average particle size of the cellulose dispersion particle decreases.<br>
            There is no particular limitation on the drying method and for example, any of lyophilization, spray drying, drum drying, shelf drying,, air stream drying and vacuum drying may be. used, and one of them may be used alone or two or more of them may be used together. When spray drying is performed, spraying method may be any spray drying method such as a disc type, pressure nozzle type, compressed two-fluid nozzle type and compressed four-fluid nozzle type, and one of them can be used singly or two or more of them can be used in combination.<br>
When the spray drying is performed, a very<br><br>

            Hereinbelow, production processes of tablet Pharmaceuticals comprising one or more active<br><br>
69<br>
ingredients as main ingredients and a porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention are described. But those are examples. The effects of the present invention are not limited to those of the following processes. A process can be adopted in which active ingredients and a porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention are mixed and then compressed to be shaped. On this occasion, the other additives besides the active ingredients may be blended, if necessary and, for example, as another additive, one or more kinds selected from an excipient, a disintegrator, a binder, fluidizing agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a flavor, a coloring agent, a sweetening agent, and a solubilizing agent shown above may be blended.<br>
            There is no particular limitation on the order of adding each ingredient, and either of i) a process of mixing an active ingredient and a porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention and other additives, if necessary, at a time and subjecting them to compression shaping, ii) a process of pretreatment mixing of an active ingredient and a fluidizing agent and/or a lubricant, and mixing them with porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention and other additives, if necessary, and then subjecting them to compression shaping will be adopted. A lubricant may be added to the mixture for compression shaping obtained by i) or ii) and they may be further mixed and then compressed to be shaped.<br><br>
                              70 [0044]<br>
            When a poorly water-soluble active ingredient is particularly used, the following production processes can be adopted. For a production process, for example, either of the following can be adopted, i) A process wherein the active ingredient is pulverized or just used as it is and mixed with a porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention and other ingredient, if necessary and compressed to be shaped,<br>
ii) A process wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed in water and/or an organic solvent and/or a dissolution aid, adsorbed to the porous cellulose aggregate used in the present invention and/or other additives, if necessary, mixed with the porous cellulose aggregate used in the present invention and/or other additives, if necessary, water and/or the organic solvent is distilled off, if necessary, and compressed to be shaped.<br>
            In the process i), it is preferable in the point of compactibility and flowability that after the active ingredient is mixed as a pretreatment with additives such as fluidizing agent, the mixture is mixed with the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention and other ingredients, if necessary and compressed to be shaped.<br>
            The crystal form of the active ingredient before compression shaping may be the same as or may be<br><br>
71<br>
different from the state before preparation, but they are preferably the same from the prospective of stability. When a poorly water-soluble active ingredient is used, it is effective to use a water-soluble polymer or a surfactant together in particular as a solubilizing agent and disperse the ingredient to the medium. The other additives as used herein are additives other than the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention, and they are additives such as an excipient, a disintegrator, a binder, a fluidizing agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a flavor, a coloring agent, a sweetening agent, a solubilizing agent, for example, as shown above. These additives may be used singly or two or more of them may be used in combination. Particularly in the case of process ii), there is an effect of improving dissolution of the active ingredient since the process goes through a step of once dissolving or dispersing the poorly water-soluble or water-insoluble active ingredient. Especially when a liquid dispersing medium such as polyethylene glycol is used together as a dispersing medium for a pharmaceutically active ingredient, even if the original active ingredient is a crystal powder, the dispersing medium in which the active ingredient is dispersed becomes liquid or semisolid, and therefore, it cannot be made into tablets unless it is excellent in compression compactibility and flowability like the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention.<br><br>
72<br>
In addition, it is said that when polyethylene glycol and the like is used as a dispersing medium for a pharmaceutically active ingredient, the active ingredient is absorbed in the body while taking a structure that it is coated with polyethylene glycol in the blood, and an effect to continue the efficacy of the active ingredient which is easy to be metabolized in the liver is also expected. [0045]<br>
            The method of adding each ingredient is not particularly limited as far as it is usually performed and the ingredients may be continually added or added at a time using a small size suction transport apparatus, an air transport apparatus, a bucket conveyor, a pneumatic transport apparatus, a vacuum conveyer, a vibration type quantitative metering feeder, a spray, a funnel and the like. When the active ingredient is a solution, suspension or emulsion, a method of spraying it on the porous cellulose aggregate or other additives is preferably adopted because the variation of concentration in the final product decreases. The method of spraying may be either one of methods of spraying the active ingredient solution/dispersion with a pressure nozzle, two-fluid nozzle, four-fluid nozzle, a turning disc, supersonic wave nozzles and the like or a method of dripping the active ingredient solution/dispersion from a tubelike nozzle. When the active ingredient solution/dispersion<br><br>
73<br>
is added, layering or coating may be formed on the surface of the porous cellulose aggregate particle so that the active ingredient may be laminated thereon, or the active ingredient may be carried within the porous cellulose aggregate particle, or the porous cellulose aggregate particles or a mixture of the porous cellulose aggregate particle and the other additive may be granulated in the shape of a matrix using the active ingredient solution/dispersion as a connecting liquid. The layering and coating may be formed by a wet process or a dry process.<br>

The compression shaping method is not<br>
particularly limited as far as it is usually performed and a method using a mortar and a mallet to perform compression shaping in a desired shape, a method of compression shaping in a sheet beforehand and then cutting in a desired shape may be used. As the compression shaping machine, for example, roller type<br><br>
74<br>
press machines such as a static pressure press machine, a briquetting roller type press machine, a smooth roller type press machine, compressors such as a single punch tablet machine and a rotary tablet machine can be used. [0046]<br>
            The method of dissolving or dispersing the active ingredient in a medium is not particularly limited as far as it is a usually performed dissolving or dispersing method and agitation mixing methods using agitation blade such as one-direction rotation type, multi-axis rotation type, reciprocal inversion type, vertical movement type, rotation+ vertical movement type, piping type such as a portable mixer, a three-dimensional mixer, a side-wall mixer, jet type agitation mixing method such as a line mixer, gas blowing type agitation mixing method, mixing methods using a high shear homogenizer, high pressure homogenizer, a supersonic wave homogenizer, and a container concussion-type mixing methods such as a shaker may be used.<br>
The solvent to be used in the above<br>
production method is not particularly limited as far as it is usually used for pharmaceutical product and, for example, water and/or organic solvent can be used. Examples thereof include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, 2-methylbutyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, hydrocarbons such<br><br>
75<br>
as pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, ketones such as acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, and other ones classified as a solvent in "Iyakuhin Tenkabutsu Jiten" (Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Additives) (published by YAKUJI NIPPO LIMITED.), and either one of them may be used alone and two or more of them may be used in combination, or after the ingredient is dispersed in one kind of medium, the medium may be removed and then the ingredient may be dispersed in another medium. [0047]<br>
            Examples of the water-soluble polymer as a solubilizing agent include hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyacrylic acid, a carboxyvinyl polymer, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, Arabian gum, starch paste, and other water-soluble polymer described in "Iyakuhin Tenkabutsu Jiten" (Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Additives) (published by YAKUJI NIPPO LIMITED.), and either one of them may be used alone and two or more of them may be optionally used in combination.<br>

[0048]<br>
            The tablet as used in the present invention refers to a molded product which contains the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention and one or more active ingredient and other additives if necessary and can be obtained by compression shaping. The composition for tablets in which the porous cellulose<br><br>
77<br>
aggregate of the present invention is blended particularly provides practical hardness without passing through complicated process by a simple and easy method such as a direct punching method, but if necessary, either of the production processes such as dry granulated powder compression method, wet granulated powder compression method, post powdering method, and production processes for multi-core tablet containing preliminarily compressed and shaped tablets as inner cores, or multilayer tablet in which plural molded products preliminarily compressed are stacked and compressed again.<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention is excellent in various characteristics demanded for an excipient such as compression compactibility, self compactibility, disintegration and therefore it is particularly effective for tablets which contain many kinds of pharmaceutical agents in a large amount and are hard to exhibit tablet hardness and easy to produce troubles in tableting such as defect on the tablet surface, chip, detachment from the inside, crack, for example, over-the-counter drugs, tablets in which extract powder such as traditional Chinese medicine are blended, small tablets, noncircular deformed tablets having points where compression pressure is hard to impose uniformly such as constrictions of the edge, tablets containing pharmacological agents which it is easy to deactivate<br><br>
78<br>
by punching pressure or friction with excipients such as an enzyme/protein containing tablets, tablets containing coated granules. In addition, the cellulose powder of the present invention is excellent in compression compactibility and disintegration properties, and therefore it provides tablets which show practical abrasion degree by comparatively low compression pressure. Accordingly, it can hold a cavity (aqueduct) within a tablet and is effective for application in disintegration tablet in oral cavity which is to be quickly disintegrated in the oral cavity. Furthermore, as for multilayer tablets in which several kinds of ingredients are molded by compression at one step or plural steps and multicore tablets, there is provided an effect of preventing detachment between the layers and cracks as well as imparting hardness as mentioned above and controlling common obstacles in tableting. The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a secondary aggregate structure formed by aggregation of primary particles, and therefore, it is excellent in division characteristics of the particle in itself and allows a tablet to be divided uniformly when used for a scored tablet. Furthermore, the porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a developed multicellular structure, and the cellulose particle in itself is excellent in the properties of holding a pharmacological agent in the form of finely divided<br><br>
79<br>
particles, a pharmacological agent in the form of a suspension, an ingredient in the form of a solution, and accordingly, tablets using it is also excellent in the properties of holding ingredients in the form of suspension and solution. Therefore, it is effective for use in layering an ingredient in the form of solid, suspension or solution on tablets, for use in coated tablets, and further for layering of sugar-coated tablets and the like in which ingredients such as sugar and calcium carbonate in the form of a suspension are laminated on the surface of the tablets, and for preventing the detachment of and reinforcing the coating layer and sugarcoating layer. [0049]<br>
            Next is described the usage of a composition containing one or more active ingredients and a porous cellulose aggregate particle. The solid, liquid or semisolid active ingredient and the porous cellulose aggregate particle composition obtained by the method described above may be used as a solid preparation in the form of powder or granule, or as a coated powder or a granular solid preparation in which the powder or granule composition is further coated with a coating agent. The granular composition obtained here with/without coating may be filled in a capsule or may be compressed and shaped and used as a tablet type solid preparation. Furthermore, the capsule or tablet may be coated and used.<br><br>

[0050]<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a developed multicellular structure and the particle in itself is excellent in holding a pharmacological agent, and therefore, the particles can be directly used as fine particles having a pharmacological agent supported within the pores or they can be used as granules granulated from them, or they can be compressed and shaped. These fine particles, granules and tablets may be further<br><br>
83<br>
subjected to coating. The method of supporting is not particularly limited as far as it is a known method, and either of the following processes, which can be optionally used singly or two or more kinds can be used in combination, can be adopted, i) A process for having a finely divided agent supported within pores by mixing the aggregate (particles) with the finely divided pharmacological agent.<br>
ii) A process for forcibly making a powdered pharmacological agent within pores by mixing the aggregate (particles) with the powdered pharmacological agent under high shearing.<br>

84<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate of the present invention has a developed pore structure and has water retention properties and oil retention properties to a moderate degree, and therefore, it can be used as core particles for layering and/or coating besides the application as an excipient and in such an application, it is effective for restraining aggregation among particles in the layering and/or coating steps. The layering and/or coating may be a dry process or may be a wet process.<br>
            In addition, when the active ingredient is a solution, suspension or emulsion, a method can be taken in which the carrier is immersed in a solution, suspension or emulsion of the active ingredient to have the active ingredient retained such as dipping method using a porous cellulose aggregate particle or a mixture of a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives as a carrier. Although it depends on conditions such as species and concentration of the active ingredient, but homogeneity of the active ingredient is practically retained even by such dipping and, in addition, this method is excellent in that the process is simple as compared with the above spraying method.<br>
            Furthermore, when the active ingredient is a solution, suspension or emulsion, another method can be also taken in which a porous cellulose aggregate particle or a mixture of a porous cellulose aggregate<br><br>
85<br>
particle and other additives as a carrier used as a carrier is immersed in a solution, suspension or emulsion of the active ingredient and the dispersion is spray dried to form into a complex material.<br>
            The porous cellulose aggregate particle or a mixture of the porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives before and after an active ingredient solution/dispersion is added may be a state wherein the constituent particles disperse independently or may be aggregated to form granules. [0051]<br>
            The granulating method when the production process goes through granulation include dry process granulation, wet process granulation, heat process granulation, spraying granulation and microencapsulation. As wet process granulation, fluidized bed granulation method, agitation granulation method, extruding granulation method, pulverizing granulation method, rolling granulation method are effective and, the fluidized bed granulation method comprises spraying a binder liquid on the fluidized powder and thereby performing granulation. In the agitation granulation method, the agitation blade is rotated in the mixing tank while adding a binder liquid and thereby effecting mixing, kneading and granulation at the same time in a closed structure. In the extruding granulation method, a wet cake kneaded with the addition of a binder liquid is forced to go through<br><br>
86<br>
a screen of a suitable size by methods with a screw or a basket or the like to effect granulation. In the pulverizing method, a wet cake kneaded with the addition of a binder liquid is sheared and pulverized using a rotating blade of a granulating machine and spun off from the circumference of the screen of by the centrifugal force and thereby effecting granulation. In the rolling granulation method, the materials are rolled by the centrifugal force on the rotating rotor and made to grow to spherical granules having a uniform particle size like a snowball with a binder liquid sprayed from a spraying gun on this occasion.<br>
            As the method for drying granules, any of the processes such as hot air heating type (shelf drying, vacuum drying, fluidized bed drying), heat conduction wall (pan type, shelf box type, drum type) and lyophilization can be used. In the hot air heating type, materials are directly contacted with hot air and evaporated moisture is removed at the same time. In the heat conduction type, materials are indirectly heated through a heat conducting wall. In the lyophilization, materials are preliminarily frozen at -10 to 40°C and then warmed under high vacuum of 1.3 x 10-5 ~ 2.6 x 10-4 MPa) to sublimate and remove moisture.<br>
For example, i) a mixture of an active<br>
ingredient and a porous cellulose aggregate particle or a mixture of one or more active ingredients and a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives<br><br>
87<br>
if necessary is compressed and shaped by a normal method (direct punching method). Alternatively, ii) an active ingredient and a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives if necessary may be mixed and granulated into granules and then compressed and shaped by a normal method (wet process/dry process granulated powder compression method). Furthermore, iii) an active ingredient and a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives if necessary may be mixed and granulated into granules and further mixed with a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives if necessary and then compressed and shaped by a normal method (wet process/dry process uncompress after granulation method).<br>
            The method of adding one or more active ingredients, a porous cellulose aggregate particle and other additives or granules is not particularly limited as far as it is a usually used method and the ingredients may be continually added or added at a time using a small size suction transport apparatus, an air transport apparatus, a bucket conveyor, a pneumatic transport apparatus, a vacuum conveyer, a vibration type quantitative metering feeder, a spray, a funnel and the like.<br>
            As mentioned above, the composition for tablets of the present invention is excellent in properties of holding a solid and a liquid ingredient, and therefore in particular, it may be used as granules<br><br>
88<br>
and powders for the purpose of improving flowability, blocking resistance, anti-aggregation characteristics. As the production process for producing granules and powders, for example, any of dry process granulation, wet process granulation, heat granulation, spray drying and microencapsulation may be used. [0052]<br>
            The present invention is described by means of Examples. However, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to those described in these Examples. The measuring method of each physical properties in Examples and Comparative Examples are as follows.<br>
(1) Average particle size of cellulose dispersion particle (µm)<br>
            A sample dispersed in water was measured with laser diffraction type particle size distribution meter (manufactured by Horiba, Ltd., trade name, LA-910) without ultrasonication treatment and with refraction index 1.20, and expressed as the particle size at which accumulated volume reached 50%. Note that the measured value by this apparatus is completely different from the dry particle size distribution obtained by the following low taps type apparatus in the measuring principle and therefore they do not necessarily correlate to each other. A cellulose dispersion particle usually takes an extended fibrous shape, and the average particle size measured by laser diffraction<br><br>
89<br>
assumes that the fibrous particle is a sphere having a diameter of 80% of the longer axis and is determined by the volume frequency against this diameter. In contrast, the average particle size obtained by low tap type method is that measured for the weight frequency against the particle size by shaking the obtained powder on a screen and fractionated, and, here, fractionation of particles are made by the minor axis of the fiber. Accordingly, the value by laser diffraction depending on the length of a particle of fiber is generally larger than the value by low tap measurement depending on the minor axis of the fiber.<br>
(2)	Crystal form<br>
             X-ray diffraction was performed by X-ray diffractometer and the crystal form was determined from the X-ray pattern.<br>
(3)	Average particle size of dry particle (µm)<br>
              The average particle size of a powder sample was determined by sieving 10 g of sample for 10 minutes using a low tap sieve shaking machine (manufactured by Taira Kosakusho, Ltd.., trade name, sieve shaker A type) with a JIS standard sieve (Z8801-1987) and expressed as the particle size at which accumulated volume reached 50%.<br>
(4)	Specific surface area (m2/g)) •<br>
              The specific surface area was measured with TriSTAR (trade name, product of Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) by BET method using nitrogen as<br><br>
90<br>
adsorption gas. About 1 g each of sample powder was put in a cell and measured. Each sample powder used for measurement was dried at 110°C under reduced pressure for 3 hours and used.<br>
(5)	Pore volume within a particle (cm3/g), central pore<br>
diameter (µm)<br>
            The pore distribution was determined with Autopore 9520 (trade name, product of Shimadzu Corporation) by mercury porosimetry. Each sample powder used for measurement was dried at room temperature under reduced pressure for 15 hours and used. A "clear peak part" in a range of pore diameter of 0.1-10 µm was calculated as pore volume within a particle from pore distribution obtained by the measurement of initial pressure of 20 kPa. In addition, the peak top of the "clear peak" observed in a range of pore diameter of 0.1-10 µm from the obtained pore distribution was assumed as the center pore diameter and the value was read. [0053]<br>
(6)	Apparent specific volume (cm3/g)<br>
            A 100 cm3 graduated measuring cylinder was used and roughly filled with a powder sample using a metering feeder for two to three minutes, the top surface of the powder layer was leveled with a soft brush like a writing brush, and the volume was read, which was divided by the weight of the powder sample. The weight of the powder was appropriately adjusted so<br><br>

Various physical properties of the obtained Cellulose Powders S are shown in Table 1. Comparative Example 12<br>
            1.5 kg of Cellulose Powders P obtained in Comparative Example 8 was placed in a high-speed agitation granulator (manufactured by Fukae industry Co., Ltd., trade name, FS-10), added with 1.5 kg of distilled water and kneaded for 5 minutes. 1.0 kg of these wet granules was transferred to Marumerizer Q-230, (trade name, product of Fuji Paudal Co., Ltd.) and rolling moved at 500 rpm for 10 minutes to spheroidize the powders. 200 g of distilled water was supplied at speed of 20 g/min at the same time. Then it was left at 40°C overnight and after dried, screened with a 16-<br><br>
114<br>
mesh sieve (pore size 1 mm) and spherical core particles T (corresponding to Example 1 of JP-A-07-173050) were obtained. Various physical properties of the obtained spherical core particles T are shown in Table 1.<br>
            Cellulose spherical core particles T were extremely dense and excellent in flowability, but they had little specific surface area and pore volume within a particle, and hardly become molded products at a regularly applied compression pressure of 10 or 20 MPa. Comparative Example 13<br>
            Commercial kraft pulp was finely chipped and hydrolyzed in 10 wt% hydrochloric acid aqueous solution at 105°C for 30 minutes in the same manner as in Example 1, and the obtained acid insoluble residue was filtered, and a cake-like substance of crystalline cellulose in which the concentration of solid contents was 40% (Polymerization degree of this cake-like substance was 153). This cake-like substance was subjected to grinding treatment for one hour with all-purpose mixer stirrer (manufactured by San-Ei Seisakusho, Ltd. , trade name, 5DM-03-R type). Water was added to this cake-like substance subjected to grinding treatment and the latter was made into a cellulose dispersion having 12.5 wt% of solid contents with a homomixer (manufactured by Tokushu Kika kogyo Co., Ltd., trade name, T. K. Homomixer MARK II), and the particle size, pH, and IC were adjusted. The cellulose dispersion particle in<br><br>
115<br>
the cellulose dispersion obtained here was one having a single average particle size, and the average particle size was 7 µm. The dispersion was spray dried using a turning plate with a size of about 8 cm under the conditions of rotating plate rotation frequency 5000 rpm, flow amount 6 L/hr, intake temperature 170°C, discharge temperature 85°C, coarse particles were removed with a screen having a pore size of 177 µm to obtain Cellulose Powders U. Various physical properties of the obtained Cellulose Powders U (corresponding to Example 1 of WO02/36168) are shown in Table 1.<br>
Cellulose Powders U were also dense and<br>
excellent in flowability, but they had a small specific surface area and pore volume within a particle, and although they could be a molded product at a regularly applied compression pressure of 10 or 20 MPa but the molded product was fragile and abraded when taken out and could be easily broken with hand.
