				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for reducing the proliferation of carcinoma cells by administration of growth hormone releasing peptides and antagonists thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone (GH) secretion is regulated by two hypothalamic peptides; GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), which exerts stimulatory effect on GH release and somatostatin which exhibits an inhibitory influence. In the last few years, several investigators have demonstrated that GH secretion can also be stimulated by synthetic oligopeptides termed GH-releasing peptides (GHRP)-such as hexarelin and various hexarelin analogs (Ghigo et'.al., European Journal of Endocrinology, 136, 445-460, 1997). These compounds act through a mechanism which is distinet from that of GHRH CC.Y. Bowers, in "Xenobiotic Growth Hormone Secretagogues", Eds. B.Bercu and R.F. Walker, Pg. 9-28, Springer-Verlag, New York 1996) and by interaction with specific receptors localized in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland ((a) G- Muccioli et al., Journal of Endocrinology, 157, 99-106, 1998; (b) G. Muccioli, "Tissue Distribution of CHRP Receptors in Humans", Abstracts IV European Congress of Endocrinology, Sevilla, Spain, 1998). Recently it was demonstrated that GHRP receptors are present not only in the hypothalamo-pituitary system but even in various human tissues not<br><br>
2<br>
generally associated with GH release (G. Muccioli et al., see above (a)).<br>
GHRPs and their antagonists are described, for example, in the following publications: C.Y. Bowers, supra, R. Deghenghi, "Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides", ibidem, 1996, pg. 85-102; R. Deghenghi et al., "Small Peptides as Potent Releasers of Growth Hormone", J. Ped. End. Metab., 8, pg. 311-313, 1996; R. Deghenghi, "The Development of Impervious Peptides as Growth Hormone Secretagogues", Acta Paediatr. Suppl., 423, pg. 85-87, 1997; K. Veeraraganavan et al., "Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides {GHRP) Binding to Porcine Anterior Pituitary and Hypothalamic Membranes", Life Sci., 50, Pg. 1149- 1155, 1992; and T.C. Somers  et al., "Low Molecular Weight Peptidomimetic Growth Hormone Secretagogues; WO 96/15148 (May 23, 1996} .<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for treating a tumor in a mammal which method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) or an. antagonist thereof. Alternatively, the compounds used according to the invention can be defined as growth hormone secretagogues or antagonists thereof- The amounts of these compounds are effective to reduce or inhibit the proliferation of tumorigenic cells in the mammal. In an alternative embodiment, these compounds are specified by the feature that they displace the radioactive marker l25l-Tyr-Ala-His-D-Mrp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH.- (125I -Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin) from a tumor containing tissue of the mammal.<br><br>
3<br>
The compounds disclosed herein exhibit binding to tumorigenic tissue and have been found to act on a specific receptor after administration, thus imparting a decrease in the number of tumorigenic cells. Preferably, treated tumors are lung, mammary, thyroid or pancreas tumors.<br>
The above mentioned compounds include certain known compounds (cf. above), but other compounds useful in the invention are not previously published and include a spirolactam, bicyclic or tricyclic peptidomimetic unit. One common feature for all compounds useful in the invention is that at least one lysine unit is present.<br>

Methyl-2S[6'-oxo-(5"-S) 3 ', 7-dia2aspiro[4,4]nonan-T-yl-]pentanoate,<br>
respectively.<br>
These units have the formula<br><br><br>
10<br>
where R] is H and R2 is the side chain of Leu or IIe (see P. Ward et all, J. Med. Chem., 33, 1848 (1990)). Also, the tricyclic compound HNH is obtained by conventional hydrogenation of the corresponding tetrahydro-norharman-3-carboxylic acids of the formula<br><br>
The units according to the formulas III, IV, V and VI constitute peptidomimetic units which are advantageous in<br>
that they lock in a p-turn configuration thus mimicking natural amino acids.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds can be also used, if desired. Such salts include organic or inorganic addition .salts, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulfate, acetate, succinate, ascorbate, tartrate, gluconate, benzoate, malate, fumarate, stearate or pamoate salts.<br>
All compounds can be conveniently synthesized according to the usual methods of peptide chemistry, such as by solid-phase peptide synthesis, as described by E. Atherton and R.C. Sheppard in "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", IRL Press at Oxford University Press, 1989, by solution-phase synthesis as described by J. Jones in "The Chemical Synthesis of Peptides", Clarendon I'res:-;, Oxford 1994, or by a combination of both solid- and solution-phase methods, as known in the art..<br><br>
11<br>
The solid-phase synthesis starts from the C-terminal end of the compounds. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for example, by attaching the required<br>
protected  -amino acid to a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethylated resin, a benzhydrylamine resin (BHA), or to a para-methyl-benzhydrylamine resin (p-Me-BHA) . As an example, an available chloromethylated resin is BIOBEADS SX1 by BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, California. The preparation of the hydroxymethylated resin is described by Bodansky et al., Chem. Ind. (London), 38, 15997 (1966). The BHA resin is described by Pietta and Marshall, Chem. Comm., 650 (1970), and is commercially available by Peninsula Laboratories Inc., Belmont, California.<br>
After the starting attachment, the protecting group of the a-amino acid can be removed by means of different acid reagents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolved in organic solvents at room temperature. After the removal of the protecting<br>
group of the a-amino acid, the remaining protected natural amino acids or carboxylic acids corresponding to the units according to the general formulas III, IV, V and VI, which also constitute amino acids, can be coupled step by step in the desired order. Each protected amino acid can generally be reacted in excess of about three times using a suitable carboxyl activating group, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) dissolved, for example, in methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) , dimethylformamide (DMF) or their mixtures. After the desired aminoacidic sequence has been completed, the<br><br>
12<br>
desired compound can be cleaved from the supporting resin by treatment with a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride (HF) which cleaves not only the compound from the resin, but also the protecting groups of lateral chains. When a chloromethylated resin is used, treatment with HF leads to the formation of a compound which has a terminal acid group and is present in free form. When a BRA or p-Me-BHA resin is used, the treatment with HF directly leads to the formation of a compound which has a terminal amide group and is present in free form.<br>
Medicaments useful for treating tumors in a mammal, including a human, can comprise a compound according to the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or combinations of compounds according to the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, optionally in admixture with a carrier, excipient, vehicle, diluent, matrix, or delayed release coating. Examples of such carriers, excipients, vehicles, and diluents, can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, A.R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1990.<br>
Any of the compounds according to the present invention can be formulated by the skilled in the art to provide medicaments which are suitable for parenteral, buccal, rectal, vaginal, transdermal, pulmonary or oral routes of administration.<br>
The type of formulation of the medicament containing the compound can be selected according to the desired rate of delivery. For example, if the compounds are to be rapidly delivered, the nasal or intravenous route as preferred.<br><br>
13<br>
The medicaments can be administered to mammals, including humans, at a therapeutically effective dose which can be easily determined by one of skill in the art and which can vary according to the specie, age, sex and weight of the treated patient or subject as well the route of administration. For example, in humans, when intravenously administered, the preferred dose falls in the range from about 1  g to about 25  g of total compound per kg of body weight. When orally administered, higher amounts are generally necessary. For example, in humans for the oral administration, the dosage level is typically from about 30 ug to about 1000  g of total compound per kg of body weight. The exact level can be easily determined empirically based on the above disclosure.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The  following  examples   illustrate  the efficacy of  the most preferred  compounds  used  in  the  tumor  treatment  of this  invention.<br>
1.   Materials  and Methods<br>
a)   Chemicals<br>
Hexarelin (His-D-Mrp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH7) , Ala-Hexarelin (Ala-His-D-Mrp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) , Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin (Tyr-Ala-His-D-Mrp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH.-) ,<br>
MK0677 (N-(l(R) {[1, 2-dihydro-1-methanesulfonylspiro~(3H-indole, 3, 4-piperidin)-1 yl]-2-(phenylmethoxy)ethyl]-2-<br><br>
14<br>
amino-methylpropanamide-methanesulfonate) , EP80317 (HAIC-D-Mrp-D-Lys-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) and D-(Lys) 3-GHRP6 (His-D-Trp-D-Lys-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH?) were supplied by Europeptides (Argenteuil, France). Human GHRH (GHRH 1-44) and somatostatin (somatostatin 1-14) were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) . Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. {St. Louis, MO, USA) . ^H-Thymidine was purchased from Pharmacia-Amersham Italia (Milan, Italy) .<br>
b) Human tissues<br>
Surgical tumor specimens were collected from the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology (Division- of Pathology) of the University of Turin. A tumor fragment adjacent to that used for<br>
histopathological diagnosis was immediately frozen at -80 °C and stored for 2 to 60 months until further processed for binding studies. Samples of 13 invasive breast carcinoma (10 ductal and 3 lobular) , 14 non-endocrine lung carcinomas (5 squamous cell and 9 adenocarcinomas) , 11 endocrine tumors of the lung, 9 endocrine tumors of the pancreas and 12 thyroid carcinomas (7 of follicular origin and 5 of medullary origin) were used. Non-neoplastic normal tissues of the corresponding organs were also analysed in parallel with the individual tumors.<br>
c) Tumor cell lines<br>
Human lung carcinoma cells (CaLul), T47D and MDA-MB231, respectively, human oestrogen dependent and oestrogen<br><br>
15<br>
independent breast cancer cell lines were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) . Cells were routinely cultured in 25 cm3 flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO? and 95% humidified atmosphere in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin-streptomycin and fungizone. When a subconfluent state was reached, cells were detached from the flasks with trypsin/EDTA.<br>
d) GHRP receptor assay<br>
GHRP receptors were measured on tumor membranes as described in G. Muccioli et al., Journal of Endocrinology, 157, 99-106, 1998, using 125I-Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin as a ligand. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between binding in the absence and in the presence of excess unlabelled Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin and expressed as a percentage of the radioactivity added. Saturation and competition binding studies were analyzed with the GraphPAD Prism 2 program (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA, USA).<br>
e) Cell proliferation studies<br>
DNA synthesis was evaluated by 3H-thymidine incorporation as described in G. Muccioli et al., Journal of Endocrinology, 153, 365-371, 1997. Starved cells were incubated with medium alone (basal) or EGF ( 1 ng/ml) in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations (from 10-8 to 10~6 mol/1) of Hexarelin, Ala-Hexarelin, Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin, MK0677, (D-Lys) 3-GHRP6 or EP80317. After incubation for 20 hours,  H-thymidine was added and incubation was continued for a iurlher 4 hours. The reaction was halted and the cells were<br><br>
16<br>
harvested onto glass-fiber filter strips. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>
Cell growth studies were carried out as described in P.Cassoni et al., Virchows Archiv, 425, 467-472, 1994. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 24-multiwell plates at a density of 5,000-10,000 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours after plating the medium was changed. Hexarelin or Ala-Hexarelin were added where requested at concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-6 mol/1. The medium was changed every 48 hours. Cells were counted at 48 and 72 or 96 hours of treatment in a double blind analysis by two independent investigators using a haemocytometer.<br>
f) Statistical analysis<br>
Data were expressed as means (figs. 1 and 2) or means ± S.E.M. (figs. 3 to 7) unless otherwise specified. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test (figs. 1 to 3) or by one-way ANOVA (figs. 4 to 7). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.<br>
2. Results<br>
a) Identification of receptors for GHRP and their antagonists in different human tumors<br>
Figure 1 shows the distribution of radiolabelled Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin binding to membranes from different endocrine and non-endocrino human tumors of various nrinins (P<o.0.1 vs. the corresponding non-lumoral tissue non-endocrine tumors of lung and breast as well></o.0.1><br>
17<br>
endocrine carcinomas of the pancreas and thyroid (follicular type) showed a median specific binding value which was statistically higher than that found in the corresponding non tumoral normal tissue. In contrast, no difference in the specific binding values was observed between normal tissue and endocrine tumors of the lung or thyroid (medullary type).<br>
b) Biochemical characteristics of receptors for GHRP and their antagonists<br>
To determine whether the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala~Hexarelin to tumor membranes shows the properties typical of ligand-receptor interaction, the binding of radiotracer was investigated in more detail in a non-endocrine carcinoma of lung origin which displayed the highest specific binding value. Figure 2 reports the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin to tumor membranes as a function of increasing concentrations of radioligand.- This study revealed evidence of saturable specific binding and Scatchard analysis (upper panel) indicated the presence of a single class of high affinity sites.<br>
The specificity of 125I-Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin binding was established by determining the ability of different compounds to compete with the radioligand for the tumoral binding sites (cf. Fig. 3). The binding of radiotracer was displaced in a dose-dependent fashion by Hexarelin, Ala-Hexarelin, Tyr-Ala-Hexarelin and GHRP antagonists such as D- (Lys) 3-GHRP6 and EP 80317, an (Amino-ezepino-indol &gt;,-D- (Lys) ., derivative of Hexarelin which docs not; release GH in neonatal rats. A negligible displacement, was observed in the presence of MK06V/, a non-peptidy)<br><br>
18<br>
GHRP mimetic that bind to pituitary GHRP receptors. In contrast, no competition was observed in the presence of GHRH or somatostatin.<br>
c) Effect of GHRP and their antagonists on 5H-thymidine incorporation<br>
Hexarelin at 10-6 mol/ was able to inhibit both basal and the EGF-stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in human cells of lung carcinoma (cf. Fig. 4; *P
d) Effect of GHRP on cell growth<br>
In human lung carcinoma cells Hexarelin at 10-7' mol/1 caused a decrease in cell number compared with the cop.trol with a significant effect (-47%) only after 96 hours. This effect further increased at 10  mol/1 and 10-7<br><br>
19<br>
 mol/1 and was observed at any time point tested (cf. Fig. 6; **P<o.001 vs. control></o.001>
In human breast cancer T47D cells Hexarelin at 10-8 mol/1 caused a decrease in cell, number compared with control with a significant effect (-54%) only after 96 hours. This effect further increased at 10"*' mol/1 and 10-6 mol/1 and was observed at any time point tested (cf. Fig. 7a; **P
In human breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells Hexarelin at 10-8 mol/1 caused a decrease in cell number compared with control with a significant effect (-33%) only after 72 hours. This effect further increased at 10-7 mol/1 and 10" 6 mol/1 and was observed at any time point tested (cf. Fig. 8a; *P
These results demonstrate that synthetic growth hormone releasing peptides and their antagonists inhibit the growth of human carcinoma cells in vitro. The antiproliferative effect is mediated by a specific receptor.<br><br>
