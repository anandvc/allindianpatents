				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION SIX-SPEED POWERTRAIN OF AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0110555 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on December 22, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission for a vehicle enabling six forward speeds and one reverse speed.<br>
(b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
A multi-stage gearshift mechanism of an automatic transmission includes a plurality of planetary gear sets. A powertrain having such a plurality of planetary gear sets varies the torque in multi-stages and outputs it to an output shaft when receiving a converted engine torque from a torque converter.<br>
The more speeds the powertrain of an automatic transmission has, the better the power performance and fuel consumption. Therefore, it is desirable for powertrains to have as many speeds as possible.<br>
Even for the same number of speeds, durability, power transmission efficiency, and size/weight of a transmission are substantially dependent on how planetary gear sets are arranged. Therefore, research for more structural<br>
strength, less power loss, and more compact packaging are continuously being conducted.<br>
Usually, development of a powertrain using planetary gear sets does not devise a wholly new type of planetary gear set. To the contrary, it invokes how single/double pinion planetary gear sets or a Ravingneaux planetary gearset are combined, and how clutches, brakes, and one-way clutches are disposed to the combination of planetary gear sets such that required shift speeds and speed ratios are realized with minimal power loss.<br>
For a manual transmission, too many speeds cause a driver the inconvenience of excessive manual shifting. However, for an automatic transmission, a transmission control unit automatically executes shifting by, controlling the operation of the power train, and therefore, more speeds usually implies more merits.<br>
Accordingly, research of four-speed and five-speed powertrains has been undertaken, and recently, a powertrain of an automatic transmission enabling six forward speeds and one reverse speed has been developed.<br>
An example of a conventional powertrain of an automatic transmission is shown in FIG. 21. The exemplary powertrain includes a combination of first to third single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1, SPG2, and SPG3 arranged from the front to the rear. A first sun gear S1 of the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 is variably fixed to a transmission case 1 by a first brake B1. A first planet carrier PC1 thereof is fixedly connected with a third ring gear R3 of the third single pinion planetary gear set SPG3, and operates as an output element by being connected with an output gear OUT.<br>
In addition, a first ring gear R1 of the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 is fixedly connected with a second planet carrier PC2 of the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2.<br>
A second sun gear S2 of the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 is directly connected with an input shaft 3, and a second ring gear R2 thereof is fixedly connected with a third planet carrier PC3 of the third single pinion planetary gear set SPG3.<br>
Here, the second ring gear R2 and the third planet carrier PC3 are variably connected with the input shaft 3 through a second clutch C2, and at the same time, it is variably connected to the transmission case 1 through a second brake B2.<br>
In addition, a third sun gear S3 of the third single pinion planetary gear set SPG3 is variably connected with the input shaft 3 through a first clutch C1, and at the same time, it is variably connected to the transmission case 1 through a third brake B3.<br>
Such a powertrain realizes six forward speeds and one reverse speed according to an operation shown in FIG. 21. That is, for the first forward speed, the first brake B1 and the second brake B2 operate. For the second forward speed, the first brake B1 and the third brake B3 operate. For the third forward speed, the first brake B1 and the first clutch C1 operate. For the fourth forward speed, the first brake B1 and the second clutch C2 operate. For the fifth forward speed, the first, the second clutches C1 and C2 operate. For the sixth forward speed, the second clutch C2 and the third brake B3 operate. For the reverse speed, the first clutch C1 and the second brake B2 operate.<br>
According to such a powertrain, the first, second, and third ring gears R1, R2, and R3 are respectively connected with the second, third, and first planet carriers PC2, PC3, and PC1. Therefore, respective planet carriers are required to be separated, and such a configuration causes drawbacks of lengthening an automatic transmission and increasing a weight of the transmission.<br>
In addition, the ring gears are not interconnected and in this case, structural strength may not be sufficiently strong. In addition, such a powertrain shows low gear ratios at the reverse gear and the highest gear such that gradeability in the reverse speed and front wheel drive performance may become inferior.<br>
Furthermore, the gear ratio at the first forward speed is highly set and accordingly, the tire may easily slip at a hard acceleration. In addition, a step ratio between the second and third forward speeds is large, and thus tip-in shock may become large during a city driving circumstances of an intermediate speed.<br>
The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in an effort to solve drawbacks of the prior art. A six-speed powertrain of an automatic transmission of the present invention employs two single pinion planetary gear sets and a double pinion planetary gear set. One planetary gear of the double pinion planetary gear set is interconnected with an adjacent second planetary gear of the second<br>
single pinion planetary gear set by a common planet carrier such that they may rotate independently. In addition, while enabling six forward speeds and one reverse speed, at least two ring gears are integrated so as to enhance strength in axial direction, such that length and weight of a transmission may be minimized.<br>
It is an object of the present invention that gear ratios at the reverse gear and the highest gear is increased so as to enhance gradeability in the reverse speed and front wheel drive performance, and that the gear ratio at the first forward-speed is lowered so as to minimize the tire slip at a hard acceleration. At the same time, the step ratio between the second and third forward speeds may be set to be appropriate so as to .avoid a tip-in shock.<br>

FIG. 1. is a schematic diagram of a powertrain according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The powertrain according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention realizes six forward speeds and one reverse speed by operating operational elements of two clutches and three brakes.<br>
According to such a powertrain, a first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 having a first sun gear S1, a first planetary gear P1, and a first ring gear R1 is disposed at a front side of an input shaft 3 that is connected to an engine through a torque converter.<br>
A second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 having a second sun gear S2, a second planetary gear P2, and a second ring gear R2 is disposed at a rear of the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1.<br>
A double pinion planetary gear set DPG having a third sun gear S3, a pair of third planetary gears P3, and a third ring gear R3 is disposed at a rear of<br>
the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2.<br>
That is, the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 is disposed forward in the transmission, the double pinion planetary gear set DPG is disposed rearward in the transmission, and the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 is disposed therebetween.<br>
The first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 includes the first sun gear S1, the first ring gear R1, and a pair of first planet carriers PC1 disposed at opposite sides of the first planetary gear P1 such that the first planetary gear P1 engaged between the first sun gear S1 and the first ring gear R1 is rotatably supported thereby.<br>
The second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 includes the second planetary gear P2 engaged between the second sun gear S2 and the second ring gear R2, however, it does not additionally include a second planet carrier.<br>
The double pinion planetary gear set DPG includes the third sun gear S3, the third ring gear R3, and the pair of third planetary gears P3 engaged between the third sun gear S3 and the third ring gear R3. One of the pair of third planetary gears R3 is interconnected with an adjacent second planetary gear P2 of the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 by a common planet carrier CPC such that they may rotate independently.<br>
In addition, the third ring gear R3 of the double pinion planetary gear set DPG is fixedly interconnected with the first ring gear R1 of the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 such that they may become integral.<br>
In addition, the second ring gear R2 of the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2 is fixedly interconnected with the first planet carrier PC1 of the<br>
first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1.<br>
On the other hand, the third sun gear S3 of the third single pinion planetary gear set SPG3 is fixedly connected to the input shaft 3 so as to always receive a torque from the input shaft 3.<br>
In more detail, regarding the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1, the first sun gear S1 is variably connected to the transmission case 1 via a second brake B2.<br>
In addition, the first planet carrier PC1 acts as an output element.<br>
In addition, regarding the second single pinion planetary gear set SPG2, the second sun gear S2 is variably connected to the input shaft 3 via a first clutch C1, and at the same time, it is variably, connected to the transmission case 1 via a third brake B3.<br>
In addition, regarding double pinion planetary gear set DPG, a third planet carrier PC3 is variably connected to input shaft 3 via a second clutch C2, and at the same time it is also connected to the transmission case 1 via a first brake B1 and a one-way clutch OWC disposed in parallel such that the third planet carrier PC3 may act as an input element and a fixed element.<br>
Here, an output gear OUTGEAR is connected to a free first planet carrier PC1 of the first single pinion planetary gear set SPG1 such that it may act as the output element.<br>
The six-speed powertrain having such a configuration realizes six forward speeds and one reverse speed by operating according to the operational chart shown in FIG. 2. That is, for the first forward speed, the second brake B2 and the one-way clutch OWC operate.    For the second<br>
forward speed, the one-way clutch OWC is released and the third brake B3<br>
operates from the state of the first forward speed. For the third forward speed, the third brake B3 is released and the first clutch C1 operates from the state of the second forward speed. For the fourth forward speed, the first clutch C1 is released and the second clutch C2 operates from the state of the third forward speed.<br>
In addition, for the fifth forward speed, the second brake B2 is released and the first clutch C1 operates from the state of the fourth forward speed. For the sixth forward speed, the first clutch C1 is released and the third brake B3 operates from the state of the fifth forward speed. For the reverse speed, the first clutch C1 and the first brake B1 operate.<br>
Hereinafter, the shifting operation of the six-speed powertrain according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 in further detail.<br>
The operating elements are arranged at respective nodes as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 showing a shift diagram of the first to sixth forward speeds and the reverse speed of a powertrain according to exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The second sun gear S2 forms a first node N1, the first sun gear S1 forms a second node N2, and the common planet carrier CPC forms a third node N3.<br>
In addition, the first planet carrier PC1 and the second ring gear R2 commonly form a fourth node N4 that is an output node, the first ring gear R1 and the third ring gear R3 commonly form a fifth node N5, and the third sun gear<br>
S3 always receiving the input speed forms a sixth node N6.<br>
When the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed while the one-way clutch OWC and the second brake B2 are operating, both the second and third nodes N2 and N3 operate as fixed elements. In this case, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a first speed diagram in FIG. 3. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D1, and the shifting to the first forward speed is realized.<br>
For the second forward speed, the third brake B1 operates from the state of the first forward speed.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the first and second nodes N1 and N2 act as fixed elements. In this case, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a second speed diagram in FIG. 3. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D2, and the shifting to the second forward speed is realized.<br>
For the third forward speed, the third brake B3 is released and the first clutch C1 operates from the state of the second forward speed.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the second sun gear S2 of the first node N1 receives the same input speed.<br>
In addition, the second node N2 remains as a fixed element.    In this<br>
case, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a third speed diagram in FIG. 3. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D3, and the shifting to the third forward speed is realized.<br>
For the fourth forward speed, the first clutch C1 is released and the second clutch C2 is controlled to operate from the state of the third forward speed.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the third node N3 receives the same input speed.<br>
In addition, the second node N2 remains as a fixed element. Therefore, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a fourth speed diagram in FIG. 3. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D4, and the shifting to the fourth forward speed is realized.<br>
For the fifth forward speed, the second brake B2 is released and the first clutch C1 operates again from the state of the fourth forward speed.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the third and first nodes N3 and N1 receive the same input speed.<br>
That is, respective gears of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG act as if they are fixedly interconnected.    In this case, speed lines are formed at the<br>
same level with the input speed as shown in the fifth speed diagram in FIG. 4. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D5, and the shifting to the fifth forward speed is realized.<br>
For the sixth forward speed, the first clutch C1 is released and the third brake B3 is controlled to operate from the state of the fifth forward speed.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the third node N3 receives the same input speed.<br>
In addition, the first node N1 acts as the fixed element. Therefore, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a sixth speed diagram in FIG. 4. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed D6, and the shifting to the sixth forward speed is realized.<br>
In addition, for the reverse speed, the first clutch C1 and the first brake B1 are controlled to operate.<br>
Then, the third sun gear S3 of the sixth node N6 receives the input speed, and at the same time, the first node N1 receives the same input speed.<br>
In addition, the third node N3 acts as the fixed element. Therefore, according to cooperative reaction of the first and second single pinion planetary gear sets SPG1 and SPG2 and the double pinion planetary gear set DPG, three speed lines are formed as shown in a reverse speed diagram in FIG. 4. Therefore, the output element of the fourth node N4 rotates at a speed R, and the shifting to the reverse speed is realized.<br>
