				<td>HIGH PRESSURE PUMPING APPARATUS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present application relates to methods and apparatus for producing<br>
pressure. It is particularly applicable, but in no way limited, to high pressure pumps<br>
and pressure intensifiers. It is particularly applicable to applications where an<br>
apparatus is required which is easy to maintain and which is hygienic.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Flowable substances, such as liquid food products, may be treated by<br>
exposure to ultrahigh-pressures. For example, liquid food products may be<br>
preserved or otherwise chemically or physically altered after exposure to ultrahighpressures.<br>
In one conventional process, the food substance is loaded into a<br>
pressure vessel where it is pressurized to a selected pressure for a selected period<br>
of time to achieve the desired physical or chemical change. The vessel is then<br>
depressurised and the contents unloaded. The pressure vessel may then be<br>
reloaded with a new volume of unprocessed substance and the process may be<br>
repeated.<br>
A variety of pumps and pressure intensifiers are known which can be used in<br>
this process. However, they all suffer from major disadvantages relating to ease of<br>
maintenance and hygiene. A typical prior art arrangement is shown in Figure O.<br>
This illustrates twin intensifiers of a design in which the component parts are<br>
connected together by screw-threaded connections. This is only one of a variety of<br>
constructional arrangements that the pressure components, or a frame holding the<br>
pressure components are held in place by screw threaded components. A further<br>
example is described in WO99/65341 (Flow International Corporation) which uses a<br>
yoke to hold the pressure components in place against the ultrahigh-pressures<br>
generated within the system when in operation. The components of the yoke are<br>
held together by screw-threaded components.<br>
A major disadvantage of using screw threads in this application is that they<br>
are susceptible to thread galling. Galling can occur with a variety of metals, but<br>
particularly with stainless steel when a stainless steel oxide surface film breaks<br>
down as a result of direct metal contact. Solid-phase welding can then take place<br>
(whereby material is transferred from one surface to another). The symptoms of<br>
galling include surface damage and seizing and freezing up of equipment. Galling<br>
commonly occurs when using stainless steel nuts and bolts together, where the<br>
contact points are subjected to high tightening torques.<br>
Thread galling seems to be most prevalent with fasteners made of stainless<br>
steel, aluminium, titanium, and other alloys which self-generate an oxide surface film<br>
for corrosion protection. During fastener tightening, as pressure builds between the<br>
contacting and sliding thread surfaces, protective oxides are broken, possibly wiped<br>
off, and interface metal high points shear or lock together. This cumulative cloggingshearing-<br>
locking action causes increasing adhesion. In the extreme circumstances,<br>
galling leads to seizing - the actual freezing together of the threads. If tightening is<br>
continued, the fastener can be twisted off or its threads ripped out.<br>
A number of ways of reducing thread galling have been suggested.<br>
Lubricating the internal and/or external threads can reduce galling, but this may be<br>
impractical in food or pharmaceutical applications because of the potential for<br>
product contamination. Using different stainless alloy grades for the bolt and the nut<br>
components also reduces galling. However, under the ultrahigh-pressures<br>
generated in systems according to the present invention, galling remains a serious<br>
problem. It is particularly serious in applications where frequent strip downs for<br>
cleaning and seal changes are required.<br>
This leads on to the second problem, being ease of maintenance and<br>
cleaning. This ia a particular problem in food and pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Pressure intensifiers known in the art, such as those described above, have to be<br>
stripped down almost entirely to clean them. That is to say, the screw threads must<br>
be completely undone and the components have to be disassembled and separated<br>
from the unit to be cleaned, and seals replaced. Furthermore, there is no provision<br>
for sterilising the components immediately prior to assembly. The result is that<br>
cleaning and maintenance activities are time consuming and costly and can result in<br>
significant down time. It is an object of the present invention to overcome, or at<br>
least mitigate, some or all of the problems outlined above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
pressure intensifier assembly comprising:-<br>
(i) a high-pressure barrel assembly;<br>
(ii) pressurising means;<br>
(iii) a first and a second end closure assembly;<br>
 (Iv) a tension frame assembly adapted to resist axial load exerted, in use, along<br>
the longitudinal axis of the high-pressure barrel assembly;<br>
characterised in that the intensifier assembly further comprises at least one<br>
clamping piston adapted to preload the end closure(s) and the high-pressure barrel<br>
assembly against the tension frame assembly in order to overbalance anticipated<br>
internal end loads.<br>
This arrangement has the advantage that no screw thread fixings are<br>
required within or associated with the tension frame or the pressure components.<br>
There are therefore no screw threads, .and consequently no possibility of thread<br>
galling during disassembly or assembly.<br>
Preferably the tension frame assembly takes the form of a yoke.<br>
Preferably the assembly further comprises a first and a second high pressure<br>
seal assembly, said seal assemblies being located at either end of the high-pressure<br>
barrel assembly.<br>
Preferably said pressurising means comprises a hydraulic ram assembly.<br>
Preferably the assembly further comprises a stand.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the high-pressure barrel assembly is<br>
detachably mountable from the intensifier assembly without the need to undo a<br>
screw thread. This novel arrangement is possible as a direct result of using a<br>
clamping piston to pre-load the end closures. Removal of the pressure and<br>
withdrawal of the clamping piston allows the high-pressure barrel to be removed<br>
simply and easily.<br>
Preferably at least one end closure is retractable and, once retracted, the<br>
assembly is adapted such that the pressure barrel assembly becomes detachable<br>
from the intensifier assembly.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment said assembly further comprises a<br>
high-pressure barrel assembly lifting means.<br>
Preferably the high-pressure barrel assembly is pivotally mounted with<br>
respect to the stand.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example only. These<br>
examples represent the best ways known to the applicant of putting the invention<br>
into practice, but they are not the only ways this can be done.<br>
The present invention relates to apparatus for producing high pressures, to<br>
pressure intensifiers, to apparatus for pressure-processing substances such as food<br>
products and to their methods of use and maintenance.<br>
Figure O shows a typical twin intensifier arrangement of conventional design,<br>
which does NOT incorporate the claimed invention but is commonly used in<br>
currently existing systems; in industrial plant, and in laboratories where appropriate<br>
levels of pressures are required, in this context the term "pressure intensifier" is<br>
intended to encompass any apparatus wherein means are provided for pressure<br>
multiplication in a working chamber in order to amplify the total pressure supplied to<br>
a platen (eg pressure multiplication sleeve, pressure accumulator). The working<br>
chamber which provides the pressure multiplication feature may be separate from<br>
the working chamber in direct contact with the platen.<br>
The intensifier assemblies 10 in Figure O depend upon screw threads 11,12<br>
to retain the principal components and to resist the substantial forces exerted upon<br>
the end closures 13,14 and the central attachment body 15, which connects the<br>
high-pressure barrel 16 to the lower pressure drive assembly 17. Maintenance of<br>
these intensifiers requires heavy engineering tools as well as considerable manual<br>
effort in order to release the threads and to separate the major components just to<br>
gain access to the working seals 19,20, which require regular replacement,<br>
especially at the higher end of application pressure range, which may require<br>
pressures in the order of 1000 Mpa. (approximately = 150,000lb per square inch).<br>
The end closures and centre section retentions are all screw threads requiring<br>
engineering tools such as "tommy bars" and spanners for any internal maintenance<br>
to take place.<br>
Thread galling, as described above, is inevitably a problem from time to time<br>
with this type of assembly, which is a further complication to this type of assembly.<br>
It will also be appreciated that during disassembly the individual components<br>
must be lifted manually and put to one side. Where large intensifies are involved<br>
this can create Health and Safety problems and may well limit the physical size of<br>
the unit.<br>
In summary, Figure 0 illustrates a conventional intensifier construction. The<br>
end closures and centre section retentions are all screw threads requiring<br>
engineering tools such as "tommy bars" and spanners for all internal maintenance<br>
work.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 1 in front<br>
and side elevation. The intensifier 30 of the present invention consists of a tension<br>
frame assembly 31 within which are located the key pressure generating<br>
components. This example illustrates a twin barrel arrangement but it is applicable<br>
to one or a plurality of barrel arrangements. In this context, and for the avoidance of<br>
any doubt, the term "plurality" has the meaning one or more.<br>
The intensifier arrangement shown in Figure 1 and described in this and<br>
other embodiments may be used for a wide variety of high pressure applications,<br>
including use for high pressure gases as well as liquid fluids.<br>
In this example the tension frame assembly is shown as an elongate yoke.<br>
However, this is not the only form which the tension frame can take. A wide variety<br>
of physical arrangements are possible, including a non-continuous frame, ie a frame<br>
which does not substantially entirely surround the pressure generating components.<br>
A yoke as illustrated has proven to be a simple and effective arrangement and, as<br>
such, is one of the preferred embodiments.<br>
The pressure generating components include a high pressure barrel<br>
assembly 32 and a pressurising means 33 which includes a hydraulic drive piston<br>
34 and high pressure ram 35 associated with a drive pressure cylinder 38. Drive<br>
piston 34 acts as an intensifier ram and primary drive pressure piston. Replaceable<br>
top 36 and bottom 37 closure seals are provided associated with top and bottom<br>
end closure means. The ram seal assemblies are therefore replaceable. Inlet and<br>
outlet spring-loaded check valves 51 are built into the top closure. Thus far the<br>
components and their assembly is of generally conventional design and of a type<br>
known per se. However, part of the novelty of this arrangement lies in the<br>
incorporation of a clamping piston 39 means which reacts against the longitudinal<br>
tension frame to exert a resilient axial force, which pre-loads the end closures and<br>
the central barrel abutments to overbalance any anticipated internal end-loads. The<br>
arrangement 50 provides the facility for lifting the clamping pistons in order to raise<br>
the caps and separate the barrel assembly (see below).<br>
This arrangement brings with it a number of advantages. Firstly, no screwthreaded<br>
connections of any kind are required to secure the pressure components in<br>
place in use. Thus thread galling is not, and can never be, a problem during<br>
disassembly/assembly. Secondly, by applying an over-compensating force any<br>
elastic movement/deformation in the tension frame can easily be accommodated<br>
and the closure seals will remain intact and effective. Thirdly, and importantly, by<br>
withdrawing the clamping piston 39 towards the tension frame sufficient space is<br>
automatically created to enable the high-pressure barrel to be withdrawn for<br>
cleaning, maintenance and seal replacement This arrangement is shown more<br>
clearly in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2, in which a numbering system corresponding to Figure 1 has been<br>
used, shows a preferred method of retracting the clamping pistons and manipulating<br>
the barrel assembly to gain free access for replacing the high-pressure seals. In<br>
Figure 2 the clamping pistons 39 are shown in their withdrawn or retracted position<br>
to provide separation clearance for the high pressure barrels to be manipulated<br>
clear of the frame assembly. Moreover, with simple automation, the barrel assembly<br>
may be automatically manipulated into the position for easy maintenance and<br>
repositioned and clamped with interlocks for safe operation at pressure.<br>
The tension frame 31 is mounted on a stand 40. Also mounted on the stand<br>
40 is a barrel lifting means generally shown as 41. In this example the barrel is<br>
pivotally mounted with respect to the stand by a swing column 42. It should be<br>
understood that in this context the term "pivotally mounted" has a broad meaning<br>
and is intended to encompass any arrangement whereby the barrel may swing out<br>
of the longitudinal plane of the tension frame. It does require or imply the presence<br>
of a true pivot point as shown in Figure 2, although this is one convenient<br>
arrangement.<br>
It will be appreciated that the drive pressure assembly 38 simply sits on the<br>
bottom of the tension frame in this arrangement and it too may be lifted out for<br>
cleaning and maintenance if required.<br>
By incorporating a barrel-lifting ram 43 into the swing column the barrel may<br>
be lifted clear of the lower ram seal assembly 44 and then swung out of the line of<br>
the tension frame. The barrel is thus lifted to clear the ram assembly on separation.<br>
The high pressure barrels are shown in Figure 2 located outside of the general line<br>
and profile of the frame, providing clear and unencumbered access to the seals for<br>
cleaning and maintenance.<br>
Assembly, once seals have been replaced and any cleaning and<br>
maintenance has been done, is a reversal of the above process.<br>
Using an arrangement whereby the barrel pivots out of the general<br>
longitudinal axis of the assembly is only one of a variety of arrangements which are<br>
possible. The barrel, or the tension frame for that matter, could move sideways or<br>
up or down, with respect to each other depending on the orientation of the unit.<br>
Figure 3 shows an extension of the claimed invention in which the twin<br>
intensifiers are required to pump liquids for the purpose of homogenisation. An<br>
essential requirement for this application is that all components, which come in<br>
contact with the process products are hygienically clean. The ability to open the<br>
assembly to clean all wetted component surfaces with sterile cleaning agents is a<br>
major advantage of the design according to the claimed invention.<br>
Positive closing power operated valves 60 may be optionally fitted and<br>
synchronised with the stroking of the intensifiers in order to improve the reliability of<br>
flow control. This provides for a level of performance over and above the more<br>
commonly used spring loaded check valves. The use of such positive valving is<br>
especially beneficial when pumping suspended solids in fluids where the suspended<br>
materials can clog or otherwise impair the operation of spring loaded check valves.<br>
It will also be appreciated from Figure 3 that the body of the drive pressure<br>
cylinder has been extended. The extended central body 62 houses the length of the<br>
ram not allowed to enter the processing chamber. Figure 3 illustrates the piston and<br>
ram assembly 55 in a raised position to facilitate cleaning the "wetted" surface of the<br>
rams.<br>
It will be appreciated that this type of intensifier can be applied to<br>
homogenising and cell rupture machines which may be used to pump various liquids<br>
and fluid suspensions at high pressure through a homogenising valve or orifice or<br>
other constricting device in order to emulsify, activate or inactivate materials for<br>
numerous processes and purposes.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further aspect of the invention which is a refinement to the<br>
hygienic application. A cylindrical shield 70 is provided and this shield is designed<br>
and adapted to be moved into the position shown whilst the barrels and caps are<br>
separated to provide an enclosed passage for steam sterilisation to be carried out.<br>
The assembly may be closed with the shields remaining in place to prevent<br>
vital surfaces being exposed to the environment. Thus, in the semi-closed position,<br>
where the barrel assembly is in the vertical axial position within the frame, but still<br>
lifted above the seal carrier, the clamping pistons remain retracted so that the space<br>
exists below and above the high-pressure barrel blocks. Cylindrical sleeves 70,<br>
which would normally be parked in readiness, may be lifted into position to shield<br>
the open gaps. Also, the high-pressure ram is moved specially into the raised<br>
position for the purpose. High or low-pressure steam may be injected through the<br>
chambers in order to achieve ultimate sterilisation of all the important surfaces.<br>
Provision is made for the assembly to be closed with the cylindrical shields being<br>
lowered down to their normally parked position once assembly is completed, so that<br>
the sterilised surfaces remain protected from environmental contact both during and<br>
after the sterilisation process.<br>
Figure 5 shows a single intensifier variation of the claimed invention in which<br>
the whole assembly is optionally horizontally mounted which would have<br>
advantages for smaller laboratory applications where bench top location is<br>
preferred. The components in this single, horizontal version correspond to those<br>
described in Rgures 1 to 4 above and are numbered correspondingly. The barrellifting<br>
ram 143 in this embodiment lifts upwards, out of the horizontal place of the<br>
tension frame.<br>
