The present invention relates to cable splice closures, e.g. for telecommunications cables.<br>
United States Patents 4711975 and 4492812 each disclose cable splice closures in which casing half-shells are fastened together by means of interlocking protrusions and apertures arranged along opposing edges of the half-shells. Cable splice closures as disclosed in these two patents suffer from the disadvantage that they are generally difficult to open and close.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a cable splice closure, comprising first and second casing parts, opposing edges of which may be brought together to close the closure, a series of protrusions extending along the exterior of the first casing part adjacent to a said edge, and a series of openings extending adjacent to a said edge of the second casing part in an extending wall which, when the closure is closed, overlaps the exterior of the first casing part such that each protrusion is resiliency interlocked with a respective opening, characterised in that the second casing part includes a plurality of apertures in its extending wall for receiving a lever to force the casing parts together such that the respective protrusions and openings interlock and/or to force the casing parts apart such that the respective protrusions and openings disengage.<br>
The cable splice closure according to the invention has the advantage that it is normally easier to open and close than the known closures, because the second casing part includes apertures in its extending wall which permit the use of a lever (e.g. a screwdriver or the like) tp force the casing parts together and/or apart. The known closures di not have this advantage, so they must normally be opened and closed by hand, without the use of tools.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, each aperture extends completely through the extending wall from an exterior surface to an interior surface of the wall, thereby permitting a lever to be inserted through the aperture from the exterior surface of the wall and into engagement with the exterior of the first casing part, in order to force the casing parts together. Preferably, the exterior of the first casing part includes at least one shoulder arranged to be engaged by a lever received in an aperture when the casing parts are being forced together.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, each aperture preferably comprises a recess in an interior surface of the extending wall which is open to a front edge of the wall, thereby permitting a said lever to be inserted between the extending wall and the exterior of the first casing part, in order to disengage respective said protrusions and openings when they are interlocked in use.<br>
■  J   :.<br>
Preferably the apertures in the extending wall are arranged in a series along the<br>
wall. Advantageously each aperture may be associated with a respective opening, or a<br>
i	ii      ,<br>
respective pair of openings, for example. Each aperture is preferably situated between<br>
at least one respective opening in the extending wall and the front edge of the wall.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, each aperture may be situated between a respective pair<br>
of openings in the extending wall.<br>
The first and second casing parts preferably comprise half-shells. In some preferred embodiments, the first and second casing parts are completely separable from one another, e.g. having two pairs of opposing edges which are substantially parallel to the direction in which cables extend into the closure in use. In other embodiments, the first and second casing parts are hinged together, e.g. having only one pair of opposing edges, which are substantially parallel to the direction of the cables. The casing parts are preferably formed from a polymer, e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene.<br><br>
Each pair of opposing edges is preferably sealed, in use, by means of at least one sealing member. The or each sealing member is preferably resilient, e.g. having a low compression set. The compression set of the material of the sealing member(s) is preferably no greater than 40%, more preferably no greater than 30%, as measured according to ISO 815, i.e. 50% compression strain at 70°C for 22 hours, measured after a recovery time of 30 minutes.<br>
The rt&amp;ii ience and low compression set of the preferred sealing member(s) have the advantage that they contribute to the maintenance of a good seal over time. Additionally, thfey may also have the advantage of facilitating the opening of the closure, by pushing the two casing parts apart as the protrusions and openings are disengaged from each other.<br>
The or each sealing member is preferably hollow, e.g. generally tubular and/or formed from a foam material. The material of the sealing member(s) is preferably polymeric, e.g. elastomeric. A particularly preferred material is natural or synthetic rubber, e.g. a silicone or EPDM rubber.<br>
The ii^vention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br>
Figure 1 shows two separated casing parts of a closure according to the invention;<br>
r<br>
Figure 2 shows the casing parts of Figure 1 fastened together; Figure 3 shows an underside view of the casing parts of Figure 1; and Figure 4 shows one of the casing parts of the previous figures, on its own.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a cable splice closure according to the invention, comprising a first casing part 1 and a second casing part 3, each of which is in the form of a half-shell. The closure has two pairs of opposing (longitudinal) edges 5 and 5' which may be brought together to closure the closure (as shown in Figure 2). The first casing part<br>
has a series of ramp- or wedge-shaped protrusions 7 exteoding along the exterior of the<br>
i<br>
first casing part adjacent to each edge 5. The second casing part 3 has two extending walls 9, each of which is adjacent to a respective edge 5' and extends towards the first casing part l/'~Each extending wall 9 has a series of openings 11 in it. As shown in Figure 2, when the closure is closed, each pair of opposing edges 5 and 5' is brought together, and each extending wall 9 overlaps the exterior of the first part 1 of the closure, with the ramp-shaped or wedge-shaped protrusions 7 in engagement with respective openings 11.<br>
Each extending wall 9 also includes a series of apertures 13 extending completely through the extending wall from its exterior surface to its interior surface. As is most clearly shown in Figure 4, each aperture 13 also comprises a recess in the interior surface of the extending wall 9, which recess is open to the front edge 15 of the extending wall. This recessing is achieved by means of the curved portions 17 of each extending wall, but other designs could be used to produce a similar feature. (In Tigure 4, only one of the extending walls has the details of openings 11, apertures 13, and curved portions 17 illustrated).<br>
Tlie first casing part 1 has a shoulder 19 extending along its exterior, which is arranged such that it may be engaged by a lever (e.g. a screw driver etc.) inserted into an aperture 13, in order to force the two casing parts together, and in particular to cause a protrusion 7 to interlock with a respective opening 11. In this way, each protrusion 7 may be caused to engage its respective opening 11 by inserting the lever into each of the apertures, or selected apertures, in turn, and forcing the first and second casing parts towards each other.<br><br>
When it is necessary to open the closure, the screw driver or other lever may be<br>
iserted into each of the apertures 13 through the open end of the recess in the front<br>
ige 15 of the extending wall 9, in order to force the extending wall 15 laterally away<br>
om the first casing part, thereby causing each protrusion 7 to become disengaged<br>
om its respective opening 11.<br>
»<br>
Each edge 5 of the first casing part 1 contains a longitudinal groove 20 for )ntaining a soling member which seals between the opposing edges 5, 5'. When a silient sealing member is used, its resilience will normally assist the separation of the rst and second casing parts by forcing them apart when the lever disengages the rotrusions from the openings.<br>
Also illustrated in the drawings are cable ports 21 and cavities 23 in the ends of le casing parts.for containing sealant (e.g. gel sealant) to seal around the cables.<br><br><br><br><br>
