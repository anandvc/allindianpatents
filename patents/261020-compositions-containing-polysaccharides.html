				<td>Compositions containing polvsaccharides<br><br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising as principal components a first component selected from the group consisting of isoflavones, soy products containing at least one isoflavone, and mixtures thereof, and a polysaccharide as second component. A preferred first component is genistein, a preferred second component is pectin.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for the manufacture of such compositions, and their use in dietary supplements, pharmaceutical and personal care compositions.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of a polysaccbaride for improving the flowability of a component selected from the group consisting of isoflavones, soy products, preferably those containing at least one isoflavone, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Genistein is abioactive isoflavone naturally found e.g. in soy and commercially available. It has been claimed to be useful as an anti-inflammatory agent, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and heart disease, for prevention of photodamage and aging skin and wrinkles, for inhibition of Alzheimer's disease and for treatment of menopausal symptoms, estrogen disorders, cancer, cataracts, cystic fibrosis and migraine. Amongst the voluminous literature in this field, M. Messina, Chemistry &amp; Industry 1995,413-415, and T. E. Wiese et al, ibid. 1997, 648-653, present interesting reviews on the biological effects and uses of isoflavones, including genistein.<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br><br>
Genistein is normally produced in crystalline powder form e.g. according to a process as disclosed in WO 2004/009576. Such a powder form has a very poor flowability. The poor powder flowability renders the crystalline powder difficult for use in making tablets and other application forms that require the powder to be free flowing. The same problem occurs if one tries to make tablets of other isoflavones or soy products, preferably of those containing at least one isoflavone, more preferably of those soy products containing at least one isoflavone and being essentially free of soy proteins and/or of phytosterols.<br>
Compositions which have solved this problem known in the prior art are compositions of polysaccharides with compounds such as (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (WO 03/011339) and L-ascorbic acid (EP-A 1 110 550, WO 03/020265, US 2001/0005514), where the flowability of the compounds was improved by the addition of a polysaccharide. The compounds (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and L-ascorbic acid are, however, water-soluble, whereas the isoflavones such as genistein are generally hardly or essentially not water-soluble. Furthermore, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and L-ascorbic acid are structurally different to the present compounds.<br>
It was, thus, not to be expected to find out that a composition containing isoflavones and/or soy products containing at least oae isoflavone, most preferably a composition containing (a soy product containing at least the isoflavone) genistein and/or its glucoside genistm, and a polysaccharide, preferably in the form of a powder or of granules, has also improved flowability. That means that the polysaccharide acts here as granulating agent.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to a composition comprising:<br>
