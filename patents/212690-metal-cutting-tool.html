				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to metal cutting tools for use in turning,<br>
grooving, parting, and threading operations having an indexable insert with a<br>
plurality of cutting edges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metal cutting tools of this type are well known in the art. US<br>
Patent No. 4,320,996 discloses a cutoff tool that enables narrow grooves to be<br>
produced. The tool consists of a holder having a recess in one side face in which<br>
a cutting insert is located and clamped by means of a center screw threadably<br>
engageable with the holder. The insert is triangular and is provided with a<br>
protruding triangular central portion, which is received in the recess, whereas the<br>
remainder of the insert extends laterally from the holder for cutoff purposes.<br>
Since the insert has a protruding central portion, it is one-handed, that is, if the<br>
insert has been designed for a right-handed tool, as shown in US 4,320,996, then<br>
it can only be used with a right-handed tool.<br>
US Patent No. 4,169,690 discloses an indexable insert for heavy-<br>
duty capabilities. The cutting insert has a plurality of cutting edge portions<br>
extending outwardly from a central body portion. The insert is held in a pocket of<br>
a holder by a clamp arm either from the side or from the top. The existence of<br>
the clamp arm somewhat complicates the structure of the holder.<br>
US Patent No. 5,308,197 discloses a machining apparatus, comprising a holder<br>
bar with a pocket member that mounts on the bar that holds an insert. The<br>
insert has a mount portion and a plurality of arms. The mount portion locating<br>
sides bear against a pair of positioning sides of the pocket member. The pocket<br>
member complicates the production and use of the apparatus. Other<br>
disadvantages include a clamping system limiting the depth of cut.<br>
US Patent No. 3,613,197 discloses an indexable and reversible, threading or<br>
grooving insert. It includes an insert support that engages the insert at the lower<br>
cutting edge. The insert support screws to the tool body and engages the cutting<br>
arm in use, limiting depth of cut.<br>
US Patent Application Publication No. 2001/0022123 A1, describes in one<br>
embodiment (see Fig. 2) a holding element in which a cutting bit with four<br>
cutting edges sits on the holding element at three spaced apart locations 10",<br>
10", and 10"". It is pointed out that the cutting bit can, in principle, also touch<br>
the holding element at a fourth location 10"" and that during use for the<br>
intended purpose a force is exerted on the cutting bit so that the bit would<br>
possibly no longer rest on the holding element at the location 10"". This means<br>
that in principle the cutting bit is not stably seated. The cutting bit would be in<br>
one position with 4 points of contact before use and then would move to another<br>
position with three points of contact during use. This is clearly disadvantageous<br>
because it means that the location of the cutting edge changes and is therefore<br>
not well defined.<br>
US patent No. US 4602897 discloses a cutting insert and, in one embodiment, a<br>
grooving cutter, is formed so that multiple cutting edges are disposed in the<br>
cutting path. Rectangular cutting inserts and radial cutting inserts are<br>
contemplated. The rectangular shape is most suited for small tools and equally<br>
so for internal applications. Multiple radial cutting inserts can be mounted equally<br>
radially disposed, but differently angularly disposed from each other, for<br>
providing a grooving cutter. The cutting inserts and tool assemblies thereof may<br>
be used for OD grooving, threading, relieving, trepanning, face grooving, slotting<br>
and milling.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a new metal cutting tool,<br>
primarily for grooving, parting and turning operations, comprising an indexable<br>
cutting insert having a plurality of cutting edges, wherein the cutting<br>
insert can be used for either right or left handed cutting operations and wherein the<br>
above-referred-to difficulties and disadvantages are significantly reduced.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide the metal<br>
cutting tool, wherein the cutting insert is positively secured in a well-defined<br>
position without necessitating the use of an external clamp.<br>

For a better understanding, the invention will now be described, by<br>
way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is an perspective view of a metal cutting tool in accordance with the<br>
present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is an perspective view of an insert holder in accordance with the<br>
present invention;<br>
Fig. 3 is a side view of the metal cutting tool shown in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 4 is an edge-on view of the cutting insert shown in Fig 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1-3, showing a metal cutting tool<br>
10 in accordance with the present invention. The metal cutting tool 10 comprises<br>
a cutting insert 12, having an insert axis A, and an insert holder 14 with the<br>
cutting insert 12 retained in an insert pocket 16 (16", 16") of the insert holder 14.<br>
The cutting insert 12 is produced by form pressing and sintering a hard metal<br>
body made from a carbide powder such as Tungsten Carbide. However, the<br>
cutting insert 12 can also be produced by injection molding. The insert holder 14<br>
is formed of machined steel or other hard materials. The insert holder 14, shown<br>
in Fig. 2, has two insert pockets 16, one 16" for right-handed cutting operations<br>
and the other 16" for left-handed cutting operations. The cutting insert 12, which<br>
will be described in detail below, can be used for both right-handed and left-<br>
handed cutting operations and as such can be retained in either of the insert<br>
pockets 16", 16". The insert axis A is an axis of rotational symmetry about<br>
which the cutting insert 12 has five-fold rotational symmetry.<br>
The insert pocket 16 comprises a base surface 18, a lower support<br>
wall 20 extending generally uprightly from the base surface 18, and an upper<br>
support 22 wall also extending generally uprightly from the base surface 18. The<br>
upper support wall 22 and lower support wall 20 form an acute angle a between<br>
them. In accordance with a specific application, the acute angle a is 36°, within<br>
manufacturing tolerances. The lower and upper support walls 20, 22 are<br>
integrally formed with the base surface 18.<br>
Attention is now additionally drawn to Fig. 4. The cutting insert 12<br>
comprises two identical opposing side surfaces 24 and a peripheral edge surface<br>
26 extending therebetween. Since the side surfaces 24 are identical, only one<br>
will be described, it being understood that the other side surface has identical<br>
structure. The peripheral edge surface 26 has five abutment sections 28 and five<br>
equally spaced apart cutting portions 32. Each of the five abutment sections 28<br>
lies on a portion of a side wall 34 of an imaginary regular pentagon 36 (shown by<br>
a dashed line in Fig. 3) and are separated from one another by a given cutting<br>
portion 32.<br>
Each cutting portion 32 of the cutting insert 12 is triangular shaped<br>
and extends outwardly from the imaginary regular pentagon 36 of the cutting<br>
insert 12. At a radially outermost portion of each cutting portion 32 a cutting<br>
edge 38 is formed at the intersection of a rake surface 40, on a leading side 41 of<br>
the cutting portion 32, and a relief surface 42, a trailing side 43 of the cutting<br>
portion 32. The leading and trailing sides 41, 43 of the cutting portion 32 are not<br>
radially directed. As can be seen, the cutting edges 38 are radially more distant<br>
from the insert axis A than the abutment sections 28. The rake and relief<br>
surfaces 40 and 42 being located on the peripheral edge surface 26. An operative<br>
cutting portion 32" projects from an end surface 44 (in Fig. 3 shown by a line of<br>
short dashes) of the insert holder 14 to cut a workpiece (not shown). An<br>
operative first abutment section 28" abuts the lower support wall 20, and an<br>
operative second abutment section 28" abuts the upper support wall 22. Clearly,<br>
the operative first and second abutment sections 28", 28" form an angle between<br>
them substantially equal to the angle a. Apart from the operative first and second<br>
abutment sections 28", 28" no other portion of the peripheral edge surface 26<br>
comes into contact with the insert holder 14. The operative first and second<br>
abutment sections 28", 28" divide the cutting insert 12 into two sections. A first<br>
section contains the operative cutting portion 32" and two cutting portions 32 on<br>
either side of the operative cutting portion 32". The second section contains two<br>
adjacent cutting portions 32.<br>
As can be seen, each side surface 24 has a centrally located<br>
outwardly protruding portion in the form of a protruding pentagon 46 having a<br>
flat surface 50. The flat surfaces 50 of each protruding pentagon 46 are parallel<br>
to each other. The flat surface 50 of the protruding pentagon 46 is smaller in<br>
surface area than the imaginary pentagon 36. The surface 50 of the protruding<br>
pentagon 46 abuts the base surface 18 of the insert pocket 16. The protruding<br>
pentagon 46 is also angularly offset with respect to the imaginary pentagon about<br>
the insert axis A, such that a given side wall 52 of the protruding pentagon 46 is<br>
coplanar with the end surface 44 of the insert holder 14. This offset maximizes<br>
the contact area between the insert 12 and the insert holder 14 without reducing<br>
the depth of cut.<br>
The cutting insert 12 has three width dimensions. A first width<br>
dimension D1, being the width of the cutting portion 32. A generally centrally<br>
located region of the cutting insert 12 has a second width dimension D2 between<br>
the flat surfaces 50 of the two protruding pentagons 46. A third width dimension<br>
D3, is defined by all other regions of the cutting insert 12 not included in the first<br>
and second width dimensions D1, D2. The second width dimension D2 is greater<br>
than the first width dimension D1, which ensures the cutting edge 38 does not<br>
abut the base surface 18 of the insert pocket 16. It will be appreciated that the<br>
cutting portion 32 slightly tapers inwardly from the cutting edge 38. That is, the<br>
first width dimension D1 is slightly variable, having a maximum value at the<br>
cutting edge 38 and decreasing in magnitude inwardly towards the insert axis A.<br>
This arrangement assures that the sides 24 of the cutting portions 32 are relieved<br>
from a workpiece during cutting operations.<br>
An insert through bore 56 extends between the flat surface 50 of<br>
the protruding pentagon 46 and has a bore axis that is coincident with the insert<br>
axis A. The insert through bore 56 is countersunk on both sides. A screw 54<br>
extends through the insert through bore 56 and threadingly engages a threaded<br>
receiving bore 57 in the base surface 18 of the insert pocket 16.<br>
The lower support wall 20, the upper support wall 22, and the base<br>
surface 18 of the insert holder 14 and the screw 54 positively lock the cutting<br>
insert 12 in the insert pocket 16. The relative positioning of the lower support<br>
wall 20 and the upper support wall 22 are such that cutting forces exerted on the<br>
operative cutting portion 32" during cutting operations are exerted primarily on<br>
the lower support wall 20 and on the upper support wall 22 and only minimally<br>
on the screw 54. This removes the need for additional structure, such as a clamp,<br>
to positively lock the cutting insert 12 and limits the possibility of failure by the<br>
screw 54.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain<br>
degree of particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and<br>
modifications could be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
invention as hereinafter claimed. For example, a cutting insert could have four or<br>
six or more cutting portions instead of five. The width dimensions D1, D2, and<br>
D3 can be changed to suit various applications. Furthermore, it will be<br>
appreciated that the present invention can also be applied to threading operations.<br>
The angle a may be modified to suit other geometrical configurations. A lever or<br>
pin mechanism could be used in place of the screw.<br>

contains an operative cutting portion (32") and two portions (32) on either<br>
side of the operative cutting portion (32") and a second contains two<br>
adjacent cutting portions (32).<br>
This invention relates to a metal cutting tool (10) comprising an indexable<br>
cutting insert (12), comprising two opposing side surfaces (24), and a peripheral<br>
edge surface (26) extending therebetween and having an insert axis (A) of<br>
rotational symmetry passing through the side surfaces (24); the peripheral edge<br>
surface (26) having a plurality of abutment sections (28, 28", 28") lying on a<br>
portion of a side wall (34) of an imaginary regular polygon (36) having a plurality<br>
of side walls (34), a plurality of cutting portions (32) extending outwardly from<br>
the imaginary polygon (36), the plurality of cutting portions (32) being equal in<br>
number to the number of side walls (34) of the imaginary polygon (36), each<br>
cutting portion (32) having a cutting edge (38), each abutment section (28, 28",<br>
28") being located between two cutting portions (32); and an insert holder (14)<br>
comprising an insert pocket (16, 16", 16") in which the cutting insert (12) is<br>
retained with the peripheral edge surface (26) being abutted at two abutment<br>
sections (28", 28") only, the insert pocket (16, 16", 16") comprising a lower<br>
support wall (20) abutting a first abutment section (28") and an upper support<br>
wall (22) abutting a second abutment section (28"); the lower support wall (20)<br>
