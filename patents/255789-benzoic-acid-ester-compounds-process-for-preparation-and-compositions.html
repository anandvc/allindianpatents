BENZOIC ACID ESTER COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS, OSES AND<br>
METHODS RELATED THERETO<br>
Technical field<br>
This invention is directed to photochemical precursors of<br>
ultraviolet absorbers, especially to benzoic acid ester<br>
compounds.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Overexposure to the sun's invisible rays, ultraviolet A<br>
(UVA, 320-400 nm) and ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320 nm) can<br>
cause skin damage. The damage can be immediate and long-<br>
term, with effects ranging from sunburn, rashes, and cell<br>
and tissue damage to premature wrinkling and skin cancer.<br>
One particularly deadly form of skin cancer, malignant<br>
melanoma, has been on the rise in recent decades, as<br>
tanning has become more popular. Over the same period,<br>
scientists have warned that the thin layer of ozone that<br>
protects life on Earth from the sun's ultraviolet (UV)<br>
radiation is being depleted. This allows more UV<br>
radiation to get through, adding to the risk of<br>
overexposure. Indeed, many skin changes that often are<br>
identified with aging actually result from damage by too<br>
much sun.<br>
Sunscreen is any substance or material that protects the<br>
skin from UV radiation. Sunscreens are available in the<br>
forms of topical lotion, cream, ointment, gel, or spray<br>
that can be applied to the skin; a salve or stick that<br>
can be applied to the lips, nose, and eyelids; a<br>
moistener in towelettes that can be rubbed against the<br>
skin; sunglasses that protect the eyes; and film screen<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
2<br>
that can be affixed to the windows of a car, room, or<br>
office.<br>
Sunscreens help to prevent sunburn and reduce the harmful<br>
effects of the sun such as premature skin aging and skin<br>
cancer. But just how much protection they provide is a<br>
matter of debate. For many years, experts thought that<br>
only UVB was harmful. However, recent research suggests<br>
that UVA may be just as dangerous as UVB, although its<br>
effects may take longer to show up. In particular, UVA<br>
may play a role in causing melanoma. Most sunscreen<br>
products contain ingredients that provide adequate<br>
protection only against UVB rays. Even those labeled as<br>
"broad spectrum" sunscreens may offer only partial<br>
protection against UVA radiation. Those containing the<br>
ingredient avobenzone (4-tert-butyl-4'-<br>
methoxydibenzoylmethane) give the most protection against<br>
UVA rays.<br>
Sunscreens should be applied between 30 minutes and 2<br>
hours before sun exposure. In general, they should be<br>
reapplied after every 80 minutes spent in the water or<br>
when perspiring heavily or every 2 hours spent out of the<br>
water.<br>
UVB (290-320 nm) is the most erythemogenic solar<br>
radiation reaching the surface of the earth. It is also a<br>
potent skin carcinogen in animal studies. Sun Protection<br>
Factor (SPF) indicates the degree of protection against<br>
UVB induced erythema. The US Food and Drug Administration<br>
(FDA) regulates sunscreen products as over-the-counter<br>
drugs. The Final over-the-Counter Drug Products Monograph<br>
on Sunscreens (Federal Register 1999: 64: 27666-27963)<br>
established the conditions for safety, efficacy, and<br>
labeling of these products. The SPF is defined as the<br>
dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) required to produce 1<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
3<br>
minimal erythema dose (MED) on protected skin after the<br>
application of 2 mg/cm2 of product divided by the UVR<br>
required to produce 1 MED on unprotected skin.<br>
All sunscreens have a SPF on their labels. The SPF<br>
represents the length of time that sunscreen-protected<br>
skin can be exposed to UV rays before a minimal redness<br>
(erythema) appears, compared to the length of time it<br>
takes on unprotected skin. In other words, it indicates<br>
how much longer the skin can be exposed to the sun before<br>
getting a sunburn. For example, without a sunscreen, an<br>
individual might get a sunburn after 20 minutes or less<br>
in the sun. By applying a sunscreen of SPF 15, the<br>
individual might spend up to 300 minutes under the sun<br>
before sunburning, that is 15 times longer than if no<br>
protection is used.<br>
Sunscreens with SPF numbers higher than 15 may work<br>
better for people who are fair-skinned, live at high<br>
altitudes, work or play outdoors much of the day, or<br>
perspire heavily. Swimming and perspiration reduce the<br>
actual SPF value of many sunscreens, even those that are<br>
water-resistant, so it is convenient to reapply the<br>
product often.<br>

Avobenzone (4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane,<br>
Parsol 1789, US4387089) provides superior protection<br>
through a large portion of the UVA range, including UVA<br>
I. Potentially a significant addition to sunscreen<br>
products for true broad-spectrum UV protection, concerns<br>
have been raised regarding its photostability and its<br>
potential to degrade other sunscreen ingredients in<br>
products in which it is used.<br>
Dioxybenzone(2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone,<br>
US2853521) is mainly used as an UV-absorber for polymers<br>
and coatings. It is used as a stabilizer for polyester<br>
film. It is effective against UVB and some UVA light.<br>
Oxybenzone (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, US2773903,<br>
US2861104, US2861105 and US3073866) absorbs well through<br>
UVA II and can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber.<br>
It significantly enhances UVB protection when used in a<br>
given formula.<br>
Sulisobenzone(5-benzoyl-4-hydroxy—2-methoxy-<br>
benzenesulfonic acid, GB1136525) extends the coverage<br>
beyond the UVB range and into the UVA range, helping to<br>
obtain broad-spectrum sunscreen preparations.<br>
Amino-substituted hydroxybenzophenones have been<br>
disclosed as photostable UV filters to be used in<br>
cosmetic and dermatological compositions (US6409995).<br>
Chemical sunscreens "block" the penetration of UV<br>
radiation through the epidermis by acting as filters and<br>
absorbing and reflecting high energy UV. The sunscreen<br>
molecules absorb the high energy UV photons causing the<br>
electronic structure to move to a higher energy state.<br>
This electronic energy is dissipated by conversion to<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
5<br>
vibrational and rotational energy within the molecule,<br>
ultimately being transferred to the molecule's<br>
environment as heat.<br>
The FDA has taken a position against the continued<br>
labeling of high SPF formulations, and has stated that<br>
the maximum SPF should not exceed 30 due to the<br>
additional costs and risks from increased concentrations<br>
of active ingredients. This is in spite of the fact that<br>
other than the expected occurrence of occasional<br>
allergic, phototoxic, and photoallergic cutaneous<br>
reactions, there is virtually no published evidence of<br>
harm from using high SPF sunscreen formulations.<br>
There are, in fact, a number of reasons why high SPF<br>
formulations (&gt; 30 SPF) may be the best choice for high<br>
risk individuals, especially when sun exposure is<br>
expected to be extensive. Rubbing, sweating, and water<br>
immersion diminish the effectiveness of all sunscreens,<br>
requiring frequent re-application of the product even<br>
with supposedly waterproof or sweat proof formulations.<br>
Another factor that enhances the damaging effects of<br>
lengthy exposures is a time-dependent diminution of SPF<br>
effect not related to removal of the product from rubbing<br>
or washing. Experiments in the hairless mouse model found<br>
a significant decrease in measured SPF occurring within<br>
the first few hours following sunscreen application.<br>
Studies in humans confirm that single applications of an<br>
SPF 25 sunscreen are frequently inadequate to prevent<br>
erythema, and that multiple applications are required to<br>
completely suppress erythema, even from a single day's<br>
sun exposure.<br>
A final factor that may not be fully compensated for,<br>
even with repeated application, is the effect of multi-<br>
day UV exposures. A significant multi-day exposure to<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
6<br>
sunlight (e.g., all day Saturday and Sunday) increases<br>
the sensitivity of the skin to UV damage on the second<br>
day of exposure. This means that even if the sunscreen<br>
functions as predicted by the rated SPF to prevent<br>
erythema on the first day of exposure, the heightened<br>
sensitivity on the second and subsequent days of exposure<br>
may lead to erythema development which would not have<br>
been predicted based solely on extrapolations of the SPF.<br>
In such instances, a sunscreen with an SPF &gt; 30 may<br>
provide significantly better protection from UV damage,<br>
particularly in susceptible individuals.<br>
Higher SPF sunscreen products have led to the use of<br>
multiple individual sunscreen agents used in combinations<br>
at maximum concentrations that may interact.<br>
The current focus on erythema as the standard against<br>
which sunscreen potency is measured may have led to the<br>
assumption that erythema prevention is also the only<br>
important goal of sun protection, and ultimately to the<br>
FDA's position against sunscreens more potent than 30<br>
SPF. This assumption ignores experimental evidence that<br>
significant UV-induced damage occurs prior to the<br>
development of perceptible UV-induced redness. Human<br>
research using sunburn cells as the measure of UV damage<br>
supports the existence of significant sub-erythemal DNA<br>
damage in the skin, and the value of high SPF sunscreens<br>
in preventing it.<br>
SPF testing is designed to evaluate protection against<br>
erythema produced by natural sunlight and, therefore,<br>
denotes principally the degree of protection against UVB,<br>
since the amount of UVA received from sunlight does not<br>
produce significant erythema. The only ingredient<br>
approved by the FDA for protection against UVA radiation<br>
is avobenzone. However, if a product contains ingredients<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
7<br>
that absorb UV between 290-320 nm it can be labeled as a<br>
broad-spectrum sunscreen, meaning it will provide<br>
protection against both UVB and short wave UVA radiation.<br>
Adverse reactions to sunscreen comprise cutaneous<br>
problems, such as allergic contact reactions,<br>
photocontact reactions, and drying or tightening of the<br>
skin. Other side effects are rare, but possible, namely<br>
acne, burning, itching, or stinging of the skin, redness<br>
or swelling of the skin, rash, with or without blisters<br>
that ooze and become crusted, pain in hairy parts of body<br>
and pus in hair follicles.<br>
Photostability refers to the ability of a molecule to<br>
remain intact with irradiation. Poor photostability is<br>
potentially a problem with all UV filters because they<br>
are deliberately selected as UVR-absorbing molecules.<br>
This issue has been raised specifically with avobenzone,<br>
with photolysis demonstrated, especially in vitro<br>
systems, that simultaneously irradiate and measure<br>
transmittance in situ. The photostability of the<br>
molecules also depends on the solvent or the vehicle<br>
used.<br>
Subjective irritation associated with burning or stinging<br>
without objective erythema is the most common sensitivity<br>
complaint from sunscreens. This irritation is most<br>
frequently observed in the eye area. However, persistent<br>
objective irritant contact dermatitis is a more common<br>
side effect. Virtually all sunscreen ingredients reported<br>
to cause contact allergy might be photoallergens.<br>
Sunscreen actives seem to have become the leading cause<br>
of photocontact allergic reactions. Individuals with<br>
preexisting eczematous conditions have a significant<br>
predisposition to sensitization associated with their<br>
impaired cutaneous barrier. In addition, certain<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
8<br>
antibiotics, birth control pills, diuretics,<br>
antihistamines, and antidepressants are among the<br>
commonly used drugs that can increase sensitivity to the<br>
sun's rays.<br>
A water resistance claim of two hours means the sunscreen<br>
should retain its full SPF protection even after two<br>
hours in the water. Even water resistant, sunscreen<br>
should be reapplied after any water sports.<br>
It is therefore desirable to discover new sunscreen<br>
compounds with a lower risk of side effects, increased<br>
photostability, and increased persistence on the skin.<br>
The present invention provides a method for protecting a<br>
human or animal living body from ultraviolet radiation<br>
comprising treating said human or animal living body with<br>

acid ester compound with ultraviolet absorbing properties<br>
per se susceptible to be photochemically converted in<br>
situ to another sunscreen compound with a higher UV<br>
protection. Also the present invention provides a method<br>

phototransposition reactions showing a high chemical<br>
yield.<br>
The phototransposition of compounds of formula (I) when R<br>
is (i) provides dibenzoylmethane compounds of formula<br>
(IX), according to Scheme 3.<br><br>
Such dibenzoylmethane compounds constitute a recognized<br>
chemical sunscreen series, being avobenzone the most<br>
representative. Thus, phototransposition of both 1-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-vinyl 4-tert-butylbenzoate and l-(4-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)-vinyl 4-methoxybenzoate yields the<br>
authorized and widely used avobenzone sunscreen compound.<br>

compounds of formula (X) , according to Scheme 4:<br><br>
WO 2006/100225	PCT/EP2006/060886<br>
33<br><br>
Such benzophenone compounds constitute a recognized and<br>
widely used chemical sunscreen series. Dioxybenzone,<br>
oxybenzone and sulisobenzone are the most representative<br>
compounds in said series. Phototransposition of both 3-<br>
methoxyphenylsalicylate and phenyl 4-methoxysalicylate<br>
provides dioxybenzone. Phototransposition of 3-<br>
methoxyphenyl benzoate leads to oxybenzone. And<br>
phototransposition	of	4-benzoyloxy-2-<br>
methoxybenzenesulfonic acid leads to sulisobenzone.<br>
The photo-Fries transposition of compounds of formula (I)<br>
wherein R15 is a dialkylamino group provides a recent<br>
sunscreen benzophenone series, being 4-diethylamino-2-<br>
hydroxybenzophenone and 2-hydroxy-4-(1-<br>
pyrrolidinyl)benzophenone the most representative<br>
compounds in said series. Phototransposition of 3-<br>
diethylaminophenyl benzoate and 3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl<br>
benzoate provides 4-diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzophenone<br>
and	2-hydroxy-4-(1-pyrrolidinyl)benzophenone<br>

The compounds of formula (I) show a progressive UV<br>
protection depending on the time to sun exposition and<br>
the degree of sun radiation. This progressive UV<br>
protection property is evidenced in their UVB and<br>
particularly UVA screening ability. Consequently, the<br>
compositions containing compounds of formula (I)<br>
constitute a safer method to take sunbaths and produce a<br>
more uniform and glamorous tanning than conventional<br>
sunscreens. Moreover the compounds resulting from the<br>
phototranspositions belong to recognized chemical<br>
sunscreen series which ensure the convenience of the<br>
method.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to the<br>
use of compounds of formula (I) to prepare cosmetic or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, personal care compositions<br>
and industrial compositions characterized by a<br>
progressive UV protection depending on the time to sun<br>
exposition and the degree of sun radiation.<br>
