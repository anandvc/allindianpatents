DESCRIPTION<br>
WATER ABSORBING RESIN<br>
WITH IMPROVED INTERNAL STRUCTURE<br>
AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates in general to water absorbing resins with improved internal structure and manufacturing methods for the resins and in particular to water absorbing resins and water absorbent cores which are suitably applicable to sanitary/bygienic materials for disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, so-called incontinent pads, and similar goods, and also to manufacturing methods for the water absorbing resins,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Water absorbent cores containing hydrophilic fiber, such as pulp, and a water absorbing resin arc widely used conventionally so that sanitary /hygienic materials, such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and incontinent pads, can absorb body fluids. The water absorbent core is used in sanitary/hygienic materials, such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and incontinent pads, to absorb body fluids.<br><br>
There are recent demands for these sanitary/ hygienic materials to be reduced in thickness for better usability. To this end, water absorbent cores are manufactured with a decreasing ratio of hydrophllic fiber, which has a relatively low bulk density, and an increasing ratio of water absorbing resin, which exhibits excellent water absorption and a relatively high bulk density. The relative quantity of water absorbing resin particles -used in the water absorbent core is hence increased, which in turn reduces the thickness of the sanitary/hygienic materials without compromising water absorbency and other physical properties.<br>
The ratio of the hydrophllic fiber may be decreased* but not further below i minimum quantity required. For further reduction in thickness of the sanitary/hygienic materials, the physical properties of the water absorbing resin need to be improved. Examples of such physical properties of the water absorbing resin include centrifuge retention capacity, saline flow conductivity, absorbency against pressure, fixed height absoibency,, mass-average particle diameter, and extraetable polymer content, The water absorbing resin needs to have these physical properties together in actual use.<br>
These physical properties can be improved by any one of the following four methods: (1) by improving the internal structure of the water absorbing resin, (2) by improving a surface   crosslink   process,   (3)   with   a   liquid   permeability<br><br>
improver or other additive, and (4) through the regulation of particle shape and particle siase distribution.<br>
Taking the first approach among them, the present invention is intended to Improve the internal structure of the water absorbing resin. We have chosen this approach because the improvement of the internal structure is effective not only single handedly, bat it also works symergiatiealiy with the improvement of the surface crosslink process and the use of additives.<br>
Some technologies are documented that are intended to improve the internal structure. For example, patent document 1 discloses a water absorbing resin that has a particular particle &amp;izt distribution, particular CRCs, particular AAPs&gt; and a particular chemical crosslink index (or chemical crosslink index under load}. The document discloses also a manufacturing method in which a particular polymerisation method is used to obtain a water absorbing resin. The resin has a high degree of crosslink, a high retention capacity, and a swelling pressure of gel layer of 35,0 kdyne/cm2 or higher. The resin is processed to exhibit a particular particle size distribution (Particles ranging from 106 urn, inclusive, to 850 urn, exclusive, account for 95 wt% or more of the entire resin content. The particle size distribution has a logarithmic standard deviation of of 0.25 to 0.45). After that, the resin is subjected to surface crossiinking, and mixed with a liquid<br><br>
permeability improver. The technology improves, gel strength toy relatively increasing chemical cros&amp;linking points.<br>
Patent document 2 discloses a method in which alkali metal silicate is added hefore water-containing gci is dried.<br>
Patent document 3 discloses a method in which two kinds of 2 crosslinking agents are used together.<br>
Patent document 4 discloses a superabsorbent cro&amp;slinked polymer material for aqueous liquids which contains a partially neutralised, monocthylcnic, unsaturated, acid group-containing monomer, any other monomer copoiymerizable with said monomer, and any polymer suited for use as a graft base.<br>
Techniques- that are similar to the present invention, but have a different objective are those involving mixing a polymerized water-containing gel with an. additive, such as a persulfate. The techniques are intended to lower residual monomers in water absorbing resins and therefore based on a different technical concept from the present invention. The techniques indeed achieve reduction of the residual monomers, ' but fall short of improving the internal structure of the water absorbing resins due to the quantities of the additives being different and for other reasons. An example of such techniques is the method disclosed in patent document 5, According to the method, a water-containing gel is mixed with fine particles of a water absorbing resin as well as with a<br><br>
polymerisation initiator or a reduction agent Another example in disclosed, in patent document 6. According to the method, a water-containing gel is upon comminution misted with fine particles of a water absorbing resin as well as with a polymerization initiator, such as a peraulfate, A further example is disclosed in patent document 7. According to the method, a water-containing gel m mixed with a persulfate. Another example i* disclosed in patent document 8 whereby fine particles arc upon agglomeration arc mixed with a per sulfate.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The above-mentioned conventional techniques have a problem that they cannot deliver a water absorbing resin with necessary physical properties.<br>
Specifically, water absorbing resin is required to exhibit good physical properties (centrifuge retention capacity, saline flow conductivity, absorbency against pressure, fixed height absorbency, mass-average particle diameter, liquid diffuaibility, etc.) in the actual use of the water absorbing resin. Conventional technology has so far failed to achieve sufficient values with these physical properties. One factor in the failure is the trade-off between centrifuge retention capacity and saline flow conductivity, both of which are important physical properties for water absorbing resin: if either of the physical properties improves, the other suffers. It is difficult to achieve good values with both of the physical properties.<br>
In. addition, although the physical properties of the water absorbing resin improve through polymerization using an additive or by changing internal crosslinking agents, it is a different story whether these approaches would optimize the structure of the water absorbing resin in the first place, It is only through the optimal water absorbing resin structure that one can achieve fund amen tally improved physical properties and    expect    synergistic    effects    in    combinations    with<br><br>
conventional art.<br>
The present inveattoti, conceived in view- of these conventional issues, has an objective of improving the internal structure of the water absorbing resin and hence fundamentally improving its performance, to provide a water absorbing resin which e&amp;ttibite high levels of multiple physical properties and a method of manufacturing such a water absorbing resin. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a water absorbent core with an excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit Lime,<br>
The method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin of the present invention, to address the issues, is a method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin obtained by-polymerization of a water-soluble unsaturated monomer, the resin having an internal erosslinking structure, the method involving the steps of:<br>
polymerizing a water-soluble unsaturated monomer; and<br>
drying at 100 to 2SQÂ°C a water-containing gel which, has a thermally decomposing radical initiator content index of 40 to 100, the index being given by;<br>
Thermally Decomposing Radical Initiator Content Index - {Ci/Mi)/(Cm/Mm) Â« 10* where:<br>
Ci is the quantity in mass % of a thermally decomposing radical initiator extracted by stirring the water-containing gel<br><br>
in  a   5%   aqueous  solution   of  sodium   chloride   for   1   hour<br>
Immediately prior to the drying step;<br>
Mi is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of the extracted thermally decomposing radical initiator;<br>
Cm is the solid content in mass % of the water-containing gel obtained by drying the water-containing gel at I80Â°C for 8 hours; and<br>
Mm is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of a polymerized monomer.<br>
The above regulation of the thermally decomposing radical initiator content index for the water-containing gel so that it falls within the specified range, and the drying at particular temperatures improve the internal structure of the water absorbing resin. The internal structure of the water absorbing resin is improved presumably because the thermally decomposing radical initiator contained in a particular quantity in the gel upon drying reacts with polymer chains in the water absorbing resin. The improved internal structure in turn improves gel strength and the physical properties listed above.<br>
In addition, the method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin of the present invention is preferably such that the water-soluble unsaturated monomer contains an internal crogtslinking agent in an amount of 0.06 to 5 mol%â<br>
The use of a crosslinking agent in polymerization within<br><br>
a particular range of quantity and the drying at a particular range of temperatures of a water-containing gel which has a thermally decomposing radical initiator content index in the above range Improves the internal structure of the water absorbing resin. The internal structure of the water absorbing resin is improved presumably because the thermally decomposing radical initiator contained in a particular quantity in the gel upon drying reacts with polymer chains in the water absorbing resin. The improved internal structure in turn improves gel strength and the physical properties listed above.<br>
The water absorbing resin of the present invention, to address the issueÂ®, is a water absorbing resin obtained by polymerisation of a water-soluble unsaturated monomer, the resin having an internal crosslinking structure and exhibiting an intrinsic viscosity IV of 7,3 dL/g or lower at such a weight-average molecular weight Mw that Log (Mw) = 6.10, where the weight-average molecular weight Mw and the intrinsic viscosity IV are measured after 50 mg of the water absorbing resin is left in 10 grams of a 0.1 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 80Â°C for 3 weeks.<br>
A water absorbing resin with improved internal structure characteristically shows a reduced intrinsic viscosity in a particular range of molecular weight when the resin is decomposed into a polymer in the aqueous solution. This is<br><br>
presumably because the thermally decomposing radical initiator contained in. a particular quantity in the gel upon drying reacts with polymer chains in the water absorbing resin, thereby improving the internal structure of the water absorbing renin* The improved internal structure in turn reduces the intrinsic viscosity in a particular range of molecular weight. This characteristic of the water absorbing resin imparts excellent gel strength and the physical properties listed above to the water absorbing resin.<br>
The water absorbing resin of the present invention* to address the issues, is a water absorbing resin containing a water-soluble unsaturated monomer as a repeat unit for a major chain, 90 mol% of the monomer being composed of an acrylic acid and/or salt thereof, the resin having an internal crosslinking structure and exhibiting a weight-average molecular weight Mw of 360,000 to 1,000,000 daltons and an intrinsic viscosity IV of 2.1 to 6,0 dL/g where the weight-average molecular weight Mw and the intrinsic viscosity IV are measured after treatment under set 2 of hydrolysis conditions, in which treatment 20 mg of the water absorbing resin is left in 10 grams of a 0.1 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 80aC for 3 weeks,<br>
h water absorbing resin with a further improved internal structure is obtainable by setting the weight-average molecular weight Mw and the intrinsic viscosity IV after the<br><br>
treatment under set 2 of hydrolysis conditionÂ® to the specified rangeÂ®.<br>
The present invention provides a water absorbing resin with improved internal structure and a manufacturing method therefor, In addition, preferably,, the present invention provides a water absorbing resin that ham an excellent centrifuge retention capacity CRC, which indicates the amount of absorption by the water absorbing rosin, and/or an excellent saline flow conductivity (SPC), which indicates liquid permeability. Thus, there are provided a water absorbing resin and a manufacturing method therefor which boasts an excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time of the water absorbent core. In addition, preferably, the present indention provides a water absorbing resin that haÂ® an excellent absorbeocy against pressure of 4,83 kPa [MP). Thus, there are provided a water absorbing resin and a manufacturing method therefor with low liquid seeping, or "rewetting," when the water absorbent core is placed under pressure.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a water absorbing resin that exhibits an excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time when used in a water absorbent core. In addition, the present invention provides a water absorbing resin that has a large weight-average molecular weight Mw after hydrolysis  and  thereby Is  capable  of preserving high<br><br>
water absorption capability in some hydrolysis in actual uae.<br>

The water absorbing resin used in the present embodiment is a crosslinleed polymer with an internal crosslinking structure. The internal crosslinking structure may be introduced to the water absorbing resin* for example, through self-crosslinking using no crosslinking agent or by copolymerizing or reacting an internal crosslinking agent containing two or more unsaturated polymerizing groups and/or two or more reactive groups per resin, molecule (the copolymerization or reaction of an internal crosslinking agent is preferred}.<br>

Any one of the internal crosslinking agents may be used<br><br>
alone; alternatively two or more of them may be used. In view of the water absorption property of the obtained water absorbing resin and other factorÂ®, a preferred internal crosslinking agent has two or more unsaturated polymerizing groups; a more preferred one has a total of two or more (meth)acrylate groups, aliyl group**, or {methjacrylamide groups; and a still more preferred one has (meth)acrylate groups. The cross-linking agent is preferably soluble in water (solubility is 0.1 g or higher, preferably 1 g or higher; per 100 g of water at 25'aC). Furthermore, the cross linking agent includes EO structure units, especially, 2-100 EO ^ethylene oxide) units.<br>
In the present invention, the internal croaglinking agent is used in an amount of 0,06 to S moi% relative to the entire monomer content before the polymerization step to improve the internal structure of the water absorbing resin. If less than or equal to 0.06 mol% is used, a large amount of uncrosslinked polymer occurs when a thermally decomposing radical initiator reacts during drying. That may cause increase in the extractable polymer content, which in turn reduces gel strength. Preferably, the amount of the internal erosslinking agent used is from 0.07 to 3 tnol%, more preferably from 0.08 to 1 mol%, and most preferably from 0.09 to 0,5 mol%.<br>
In the polymerization step, a hydrophilic polymer, such<br><br>
as starch-cellulose, a derivative of starch-cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylie acid (salt), or a crosslinked polymer of polyacrylie acid {salt}, may be added in, for example, 0 to 30 wt% (relative to the monomer). Also in the polymerization, a chain transfer agent, Â®-uch as hypophosphorous acid (salt), may be added in, for example, 0 to I vrt% (relative to the monomer),<br>
The monomer containing the above-mentioned acrylic acid and/or salt thereof as the primary companen.t{8) can be polymerized in the polymerization step by bulk polymerization* reverse suspension polymerization, or precipitation polymerisation* Nevertheless, solution polymerization, using the monomer dissolved or dispersed in water, is preferred in view of performance and eaae in controlling the polymerization. These polymerizations are described in, for example, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,625,001, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,769,427, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,873,299, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,093,776, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,367,323, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,446,261, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,683,274, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,690,996, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,721,647, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,738,867, the Specification of U.S. Patent 4,748,076., and the Specification of U.S. Published Patent Application 2002/4009S.<br><br>
In the polymerization, step, a radical polymerization initiator, such as potassium persulfate, ammonium per sulfate, sodium persulfate, t-butylhydrepercxide, hydrogen peroxide, or 2,2'-a2obÂ£&amp;(2-amidina propane} dihydrochloride, or an activation energy beam, such as an ultraviolet or electron beam, may be used.<br>
In the case of using the radical polymerisation initiator, rcdoK polymerization may be carried out by using in combination with a reduction agent, such as sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen, sulfite, ferrous sulfate, or L-ascorbic acid. Preferably, however, a thermally decomposing, water-soluble radical polymerization initiator {solubility is 1 g or higher, preferably 10 g or higher, per 100 g of water at 25BCK chosen from azo compounds and peroxides, i$ used.<br>
The radical initiator is preferably added to a reaction system for the polymerisation step, The "reaction system for the polymerisation step" refers to a reaction system, capable of producing a water-containing gel,, in which the water-soluble unsaturated monomer could be polymerized. Therefore, the reaction system for the polymerization step is not limited in any particular manner so long as it includes a water-soluble unsaturated monomer, The system may include an internal crosslinking agent, a chain transfer agent, or a a-hydroxy carboxylie acid fsalt), to name a few examples.<br>
The radical polymerisation initiator may be added before<br><br>
and/or    during    the    polymerization    step,    not   after    the polymerization step.<br>
Throughout this specification, "before the polymerization step" referÂ® to the time before the water-soluble unsaturated monomer starts polymerization, "During the polymerization step* refers to the period from the time when the water-soluble unsaturated monomer starts polymerisation to the time when the polymerization terminates, "After the polymerisation step* refers to the time after the polymerization of the water-soluble unsaturated monomer terminates,<br>
Whether or not the water-soluble unsaturated monomer has started polymerization is determined through a rise in temperature of the produced polymer. Specifically, it is determined that the water-soluble unsaturated monomer has started polymerisation when the rise in temperature has reached 3aC (preferably 5BC).<br>
Whether or not the polymerization of the water-soluble unsaturated monomer has terminated is determined according to whether the rise in temperature in polymerization h has not reached a peak and whether the remaining monomer has or haÂ® not reduced to 5 mass % or less.<br>
The addition of the radical polymerization initiator to the reaction system for the polymerisation step before the polymerization  step  and /or during the  polymerization  step<br><br>
causes a particular amount of the radical initiator to remain inside the water-containing geL In addition,, when the water-containing gel is dried, the particular amount of the radical initiator works on polymer chains in the water absorbing resin, thereby improving the internal structure of the water aba orbing ressiru<br>
The radical polymerization initiator (especially,, the thermally decomposing radical initiator) is uaed preferably in 0,051 to 1.000 mol% or less, more preferably in 0,054 to 0.2000 mol%f and most preferably in 0,058 to 0,1000 mol%, relative to the entire monomer content.<br>
The polymerization is preferably performed in the presence of an a-hydroxy carboxylic acid (salt) in the present indention, which prevents the water absorbing resin from being colored- The hydroxy carboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid containing a hydroxy! group in a molecule, Examples of such acids include lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid, glyceric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, isocitric add* salicylic acid, mandellc acid, gallic acid, mevalonic acid, quinic acid, sbikimic acid, and ji-hydroxy propionic acid.<br>
Among the compounds, the a-hydrÂ©xy carboxylic acid, usied in the present invention, refers to the e&amp;rboxylic acid in which a hydroxy! group is bonded to the carbon at an a site in a molecule. The acid is preferably a non-polymer a-hydroxy carboxylic acid and has a weight-average molecular weight of<br><br>
40 to 2000, more preferably 60 to 1000, and still more preferably J 00 to 500. Also, the acid is preferably water-nolubie. Examples of the a-hydroxy carboxyllc acid include lactic acid tsaltj, citric acid (salt), malic acid (salt), isocitric acid {salt), glyceric acid (salt), and polya-hydroxy acrylic acid (salt). Thotc a-hydroxy carboxyllc acids which are especially preferred among them are lactic acid and a-hydroxy polycarboxylic acids which contain two or more carboxyi groups, preferably 2 to 10, more preferably, 2 to 6, even more preferably 2 to 4, in a single molecule. Malic acid (salt) and citric acid (salt) arc most preferably used in view of water absorption and improvement in the coloring problem,<br>
If the a-hydroxy carboxyllc acid is a salt in the present invention, the acid is preferably a monovalent salt of an alkali metal, such as lithium, potassium, and sodium, ammonia, or amine in view of solubility water, If the a-hydroxy polycarboxylic acid is used as a salt, either all or some of the carboxyl groups may be turned into salt.<br>
The a-hydroxy carboxylic acid, preferably the a-hydroxy polycarboxylic acid, used in the present invention may be used normally in an amount of 0.01 to 10 mass %t preferably 0,05 to 5 mass %, more preferably 0,1 to 3 mass %t and most preferably 0.2 to 3 mass % relative to the water-soluble unsaturated monomer or the associated polymer, in view of water absorption and coloring prevention,<br><br>
In the present invention, it takes preferably 20 minutes, or less, more preferably 15 miniates or less, for the polymer temperature to reach a maximum since the start of the polymerization (determined in terms of temperature rises, viscosity rises, and whitening).. Through these time range settings, the resultant thermally decomposing radical initiator content index readily falls in a preferred range.<br>
In the present invention, the thermally decomposing radical initiator content index can be made to fall in the preferred range by adjusting, to a given value, the time taken by the polymer to become dried after its temperature has reached the maximum. The atmospheric temperature during that period of time is also adjustable to a given value to make the thermally decomposing radical initiator content index fall into the preferred range.<br>
Water-containing Gel<br>
In the present Invention, the thermally decomposing radical initiator content indess is regulated to 40 to 100, The index is given by the equation below from *Ci/ 'Mi,8 "Cm," and "Mm," Ci is the quantity in mass % of a thermally decomposing radical initiator extracted by stirring a water-containing gel in a 5% aqueous solution of sodium chloride for 1 hour immediately prior to the drying step. Mi is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of the extracted<br><br>
thermally decomposing radical initiator, Cm is the solid content in masÂ® % of the water-containing gel obtained by drying the water-containing gel at 180*0 for 8 hours. Mm is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of a polymerized monomer. The thermally decomposing radical initiator content Index is preferably from 41 to 80 s and most preferably from 42 to 80.<br>
Thermally Decomposing Radical Initiator Content Index - (Ci/Mi)/(Cm/Mm) * 10s5 where:<br>
Ci is the quantity in mass % of a thermally decomposing radical initiator extracted by stirring a water-containing gel in a 5% aqueous solution of sodium chloride for 1 hour immediately prior to the drying step;<br>
Mi is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of the extracted thermally decomposing radical initiator;<br>
Cm is the Â«olid content in mass % of the water-coataining gel obtained by drying the water-containing gel at 180Â°C for 8 hours; and<br>
Mm is the mole-average molecular weight in mol/g of a polymerized monomer.<br>
We have found that the above regulation of the thermally decomposing radical initiator content index for the water-containing gel so that it falls within the specified range, and   the   drying   at   particular   temperatures   improve   the<br><br>
mcernai structure oi tne water absorbing resin, thereby greatly improving various physical properties, which has led to the completion of the invention. If the index is less than 40, the internal polymer chain of the water absorbing resin may experience little change, possibly failing to achieve sufficient improvement effects. That raises possibility that the physical properties may not be improved. If the indess is greater than 100, the internal polymer chain of the water absorbing resin may go under excess change and suffer damage. That can increase the extraetable polymer content, possibly failing to achieve improvement in the physical properties. The thermally decomposing radical initiator is preferably the above-mentioned radical initiator* most preferably a persulfate.<br>
When samples are prepared of the water-containing gel immediately prior to the drying step, if necessary, the particle diameter should be adjusted to 5 mm,, preferably to shorter than or equal to 3 mm, and the samples then be immediately placed in an atmosphere at -25Â°G for rapid cooling before the measurement of the numeric values. These precautions prevents decomposition of the thermally decomposing radical initiator.<br>
The water absorbing resin of the present invention changes its* solubility during the course of the 'treatment by preferably 10 to 100 wt%, more preferably 30 to 95 wt%, and<br><br>
even more preferably 50 to 90 wt%. The solubility after the<br>
treatment is preferably SO to 100 wt%, more preferably 70 to 100 wt%Â» and even more preferably 90 to 1Q0 wt%.<br>
After the polymerization according to the present invention, the water-containing gel before the drying contains preferably 10 mass % or leas, more preferably 7 mass % or less, and most preferably 5 mass % less unreacted monomer. Accordingly, the improvement of the internal structure of the water absorbing resin,, which occurs during the drying,, is presumably less likely to be disrupted by the unreacted monomer. The ratio of the unreacted monomer does not need to be lowered further than about 0.01%* or more preferably 0.1%.<br>
After the polymerization according to the present invention, the solid content {measured by the method which will be detailed later) in. the water-containing gel before the drying is preferably 10 to 80 mass %, more preferably 20 to 70 mass %, and most preferably 30 to 60 mass %, After the polymerization according to the present invention, the water-*containing gel before the drying preferably contains the aboYc-mentioned a-hydroxy c&amp;rboxylic acid (salt),<br>
Drying<br>
In the	where the crosslinked polymer is obtained by<br>
solution polymerisation and. is in the form of gel, in other<br><br>
words,   where   the   crosalinked   polymer   is    a   cros Blinked<br>
polymer in the farm of a water- con tain in g gel (hereinafter mayÂ¬be referred to simply as "water-containing gel"}, the crosslinked polymer is dried and usually pulverized /crushed<br>
before and/or after the drying, to produce the water absorbing resin. In the present invention, drying is an operation of increasing the solid content of a get-like substance until it becomes like powder* Typically, the content is increased up to 90% or higher, preferably 93%' or even higher, more preferably 95% or higher. There is no need to exceed about 99%. The drying may be performed simultaneously with the polymerization. Preferably* however, there is provided a drying step {drying device) after the polymerization.<br>
In the present invention, the drying is performed at 100Â°C to 2$0Â°C at 50% or more, especially, substantially all. At temperatures below 10O*C, the internal polymer chain of the water absorbing resin may experience little change, possibly failing to achieve sufficient improvement effects. That raises possibility that the physical properties may not be improved. At temperatures above 2S0"CÂ» the water absorbing resin may suffer damage. That can increase the extractable polymer content, possibly failing to achieve improvement in the physical properties. The drying temperature is specified in terms of the temperature of a heat medium. If the drying<br><br>
temperature cannot be specified in terms of heat medium temperature as in the case of microwave drying, the drying temperature is specified in terms of material temperature, There is no particularly preferred drying method, so long as the parameters fall in the above-mentioned ranges. Possible examples would be windless drying, depre&amp;surized drying, infrared drying&gt; and microwave drying, Hot wind drying is preferred. The dry air flow rate is preferably from 0.01 to 10 m/scc, more preferably from 0.1 to 5 m/sec.<br>
the drying temperature in more preferably from 130Â°C to 220Â°C&gt; most preferably from ISO^C to 20QeC. The temperature may be either constant or varied. In any case, almost all the drying Â«tep{s) should be preferably performed at the above-mentioned temperature.<br>
The drying time,, â which may vary depending on the surface area of the polymer, water content, and the type of drier, is determined to achieve the target water content. The drying time is preferably 10 to 120 minutes, more preferably 20 to 90 minutes, most preferably 30 to 60 minutes. With a drying time shorter than 10 minutes, the internal polymer chain of the water absorbing rciin may experience little change, possibly failing to achieve sufficient improvement effects. That raiseÂ® possibility that the physical properties may not be improved, With a drying time in excess of 120 minutes, the water absorbing resin may suffer damage. That<br><br>
can increase the extractable polymer content* possibly failing to achieve improvement in the physical properties.<br>
In the present invention, the solid content (measured by the method which will be detailed later) in the water absorbing resin after the drying is preferably 90 mass % or higher, most preferably 95 mass % or higher. If the solid content Â£s low, fluidity falls, causing difficulty in manufacturing: the water absorbing resin may not be pulvcrizable, or a particular particle size distribution may not be achievable. In addition, the internal polymer chain of the water absorbing resin may experience little change, possibly failing to achieve sufficient improvement.<br>
Pulverization &amp; Classification<br>
The dried substance obtained according to the above-mentioned method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin, is pulverised in a pulverizer. The pulveriser is not limited in any particular manner. Examples include a roll-using pulverizer like a roll mill; a hammer-using pulverizer like a hammer mill; an impact applying pulverizer, a cutter mill, a turbo grinder, a ball mill, and a flush mill. Among them, the roll mill is preferred for the control of a particle smc distribution- The pulverization may be performed successively twice or more times (preferably three or more times) for the control of a particle size distribution* If the<br><br>
pulveriss&amp;tion is performed twice or more, the same pulveriser or different pulverisers may be used. Different types of pulverizers may also be used in any combination.<br>
The pulverized water absorbing resin may be subjected to classification using sieves with particular mesh, sizes to give the ream a particular particle size distribution. The classifier is not limited in any particular manner. Examples include a vibration sieve (unbalance weight drive type, resonance type, vibration motor type, electromagnetic type, . disc vibration type, etc.), an in-plane motion sieve {horizontal motion type, horizontal circular-straight line motion type, three-dimensional circular motion type, etc.J, a movable net type sieve, a forced stirring type sieve, a net surface vibration type sieve, a wind force sieveÂ» and a sonic wave sieve. The vibration sieve and the in-plane motion sieve are preferred. The mesh is preferably from 1000 urn to 300 um, more preferably from 900 um to 400 pm, and most preferably from 710 urn to 450 pun. If the mesh is out Â©f these ranges, the target particle mzc distribution may be unobtainable.<br>
For the purpose of giving the resin a particular particle size distribution, the water absorbing resin of the present invention may be subjected to further classification to remove some or all of the particles smaller than a particular diameter. The classifier is not limited in any particular manner in the current    step.    Preferable   example*   include    fine    particle<br><br>
classification devices (centrifugal force types, inertia force types, etc.), as well as those listed above. The current step removes some or all of the particles with diameters of preferably 200 pm or less, more preferably 150 pm or less, and most preferably 106 ytm or less.<br>
The water absorbing resin obtained by the polymerisation explained above is typically granulated particles or primary particles (single particles) of which the shape w, for instance, Irregularly pulverized, spherical, fibrous, virgate, substantially spherical, or flat. It is preferred if the resin, has an irregularly pulverised shape because the â¢ resin can be readily fixed when, for example, used in a water absorbent core.<br>
Surface Crosslinking<br>
The water absorbing resin according to the present embodiment preferably has its surface and nearby regions crossKnked by an organic surface crosslinking agent and/or a water-soluble inorganic surface crosslinking agent. In other words, the method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin according to the present invention preferably involves a step of surface crosalinking the dried water absorbing resin,<br>
Having its surface and nearby regions erosslinked by the surface erosslinking agent, the water absorbing resin causes less liquid seeping when swollen and placed under pressure.<br><br>
The resin hence shows greater AAP and SFC values. As a result, the water absorbing resin, when used in a water absorbent core, causes low liquid seeping, or "rcwetting," under pressure and provides a water absorbent core with an excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time.<br>
Examples of the surface crosslinking agent that can be used in the surface crosslinking Include organic surface crosslinking agents and /or water-soluble inorganic surface crosslinking agents with two or more functional groups which can react with the functional groups, especially, earboxyl groups, of the water absorbing resin.

Any one of these surface crosalinking agents may be uÂ»cd alone; alternatively two or more of them may be used together, Among them, poiyhydric alcohols are preferred because they are very safe and capable of improving the hydrophilielty of the water absorbing resin surface.<br>
The surface crosslmking agent is used preferably in an amount of from 0.001 mass part&amp; to 5 mass parts inclusive, relative to 100 mass parts of the solid content of the water absorbing resin.<br>
Water may be used in mixing the surface crosslmking agent with the water absorbing resin, The water is used in an amount of preferably from 0,5 mass parts, exclusive, to 10 mass parts, inclusive, and more preferably from 1 mass part to S mass parts, both inclusive, relative to 100 mass parts of the solid content of the water absorbing resin.<br>
A hydrophilic organic solvent or a third substance may be used as an auxiliary agent when mixing a surface crosslinking agent or its aqueous solution with the water absorbing resin. Examples of such hydrophilic organic solvents include lower alcohols, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl<br><br>

The hydrophilic organic solvent may be used in an amount preferably 10 mass parts or less, and more preferably from 0 mass parts to 5 mass parts&gt; both inclusive, relative to 100 mass parts of the solid content of the water absorbing resin. That amount however may vary depending on the type* particle diameter, and water content of the water absorbing resin, as well as other factors.<br>
The third substance may be, for instance, the inorganic, organic, or polyamino acid described in the Specification of European Patent 0668080. The auxiliary mixed agent may act<br><br>
as a surface crosslinking agent, but preferably should not adversely affect the water absorption capability of the water absorbing resin after the surface eras si inking. The water absorbing resin of the present embodiment is preferably croaslinked by mixing the resin with a surface crosslinking agent containing no bydrophilic organic solvent of which the boiling point is 100*C or below and then heating the mixture. If the water absorbing resin contains a hydrophilic organic solvent of which the boiling point is 100DC or below, the hydrophilic organic solvent may vaporizer changing the environment in which the surface crosslinking agent resides â¢ on the surface of the water absorbing resin. One may not achieve sufficient SPC or other physical properties.<br>
When the surface crosslinking agent is mixed with the water absorbing resin, preferably, a water-soluble inorganic salt (preferably a per#ulfate) is also present to obtain a more uniform mixture of the water absorbing resin and the surface crosslinking agent. The water-soluble inorganic salt is used in an amount of preferably from 0.01 mass parts to 1 mass, part inclusive, and more preferably from 0,05 mass parts to 0.5 mass parts inclusive, relative to 100 mass parts of the solid content of the water absorbing resin, The amount however may vary depending on the type and particle diameter of the water absorbing resin, a$ well as other factors, In other words, the  water  absorbing resin   of the   present   embodiment  is<br><br>
preferably croÂ»Â»linked by mixing the resin with an organic surface crosslinking agent and/or a water-soluble inorganic surface crosslinking agent containing a water-soluble inorganic salt (preferably a pcrsulfate) in a ratio of 0.01 mass % to 1.0 mass %, inclusive, to the water absorbing resin and then heating the mixture.<br>
The method for mixing the surface crosslinking agent with the water absorbing resin is not limited in any particular manner, ?or example, the water absorbing resin â¢ may be immersed in a hydrophilic organic solvent and mixed with a surface crosslinking agent dissolved, as necessary, in water and/or a hydrophilic organic solvent. Another mixing method example may be to directly spray or add dropwfse to the water absorbing resin a surface crosslinking agent dissolved in water and /or a hydrophilic organic solvent,<br>
After mixing the surface crosslinking agent with the water absorbing resin, heat is usually and preferably applied so that the crosslink reaction can proceed. The heat treatment temperature (heat medium temperature), although variable depending on the surface crosslinking agent being used, is preferably from 40rtC to 250Â°C inclusive, and more preferably from 150Â°C to 250Â°C inclusive. If the heat treatment temperature is lower than 40Â°C, the AAP, SFC, and other absorption properties may not be sufficiently improved. If the heat treatment temperature is higher than 250*0, the<br><br>
excess heat may degrade the water absorbing resin and hence various physical properties; care should be taken, The heat treatment time is preferably from J minute to 2 hours inclusive, and more preferably from 5 minutes to I hour inclusive. Preferably, the surface crosslimking is performed in the presence of the a-hydroxy carbosylie acid {salt) mentioned above, in which case the water absorbing resin is prevented from being colored.<br>
Salt of Polyvalent Metal and Other Additives<br>
The method of manufacturing a water absorbing according to the present invention preferably involves a step of adding a polyvalent metal salt to the water absorbing resin (preferably to the particle surface), especially, in or after the surface croaalinking. The polyvalent metal salt Is added in an amount of preferably from 0.001 mass %' to 5 mass % inclusive, and more preferably from 0.01 mass % to 1 mass % inclusive, relative to the water absorbing resin.<br>
Due to the addition of the polyvalent metal salt (preferably a water-soluble trivalent metal salt), the water absorbing resin of the present invention shows improved saline flow conductivity SPC while substantially preserving its absorbency under the pressure of 4.83 kPa AAP and fixed height absorbency FHA
Concrete examples of the polyvalent metal salt that can<br><br>
be U*cd in the present invention include a sulfate, nitrate, carbonate, phosphate, organic aeid salt, halide (e.g., chloride) of a metal selected from Zn, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Al, Fe, Mn, Ti, Zt, Ce, Ru, Y, and Cr as examples. Other examples are those polyvalent metal salts described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (TokukaiJ 2005-U317.<br>
Among the polyvalent metal salt*, water-soluble trivalent metal salts are the most preferred, Concrete examples of the water-soluble trivalent metal salts include aluminum chloride, aluminum, polychloride, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate, aluminum potassium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, potassium alum, ammonium alum, sodium alum, sodium aluminate, ironflll} chloride, cerium{lll} chloride, ruthenium(III) chloride, yttrium(III) chloride, and chromiumflll) chloride.<br>
It is preferable to usÂ© th	alts which contain crystal<br>
water in view of the solubility of urine and other liquids absorbed. Preferred among them are aluminum compounds, especially, aluminum chloride, aluminum polychioridc, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate, aluminum potassium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, potassium alum, ammonium alum, sodium alum, and sodium aluminate. Aluminum sulfate is particularly preferred. The most preferred is an aqueous solution of aluminum sulfate (desirably,   a  solution  of aluminum  sulfate  with   a  90%  or<br><br>
higher concentration as based on saturation). Any one of these compounds may be used alone; alternatively two or more of them may be used together,<br>
The method of manufacturing a water absorbing resin according to the present invention preferably involves a step of adding the a-hydroxy carboxylic acid (salt) named above, The addition prevents the water absorbing reain from being. colored.

water absorbent core<br>
The water absorbent  core  of the  present embodiment<br>
contains the water absorbing resin described in the foregoing. The water absorbent core, when used in combination with an appropriate material, is suited for use as an absorbent layer in sanitary/hygienic materials* for example. The following will describe the water absorbent core.<br>
The water absorbent core is a molded composition made of the water absorbing resin and other materials. The core is<br><br>
used m disposable -diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads, medical pads, and like sanitary/hygienic materials to absorb blood, body fluids, urine, etc. An example of the other materials, used in combination with the water absorbing re$in IM cellulose fiber. Concrete examples of cellulose fiber include mechanical pulp made from wood; wood pulp fibers, such as chemical pulp, semi-chemical pulp, and soluble pulp;, and artificial cellulose fibers, such as rayon and acetate. Preferred . cellulose fiber is the wood pulp fibers. The cellulose fiber may partially contain, nylon, polyester, or another synthetic fiber. When the water absorbing resin of the present embodiment is used as part of the water absorbent core, the mass of the water absorbing resin contained In the water absorbent core is preferably 20 mass % or -more, more preferably 30 mass % or more, even more preferably 40 maÂ«Â« % or more, still preferably 60 wt% or more, If the aws of the water absorbing resin of the present invention, contained in the water absorbent core is ]eÂ»Â» than 20 mass %, sufficient effects may not be accomplished.<br>
A publicly known, suitable method for producing a water absorbent core may be selected to produce the water abtorbeot core from the water absorbing resin of the present embodiment and the cellulose fiber. For example, the water absorbing resin may be sprayed onto sheets or mats made of the cellulose fiber and sandwiching more of the resin between<br><br>
them if necessary. Alternatively, the cellulose fiber may be uniformly Wended with the water absorbing resin. A preferred method is to dry mix the cellulose fiber with the water absorbing resin and compress the mixture. This method is highly capable of restraining the water absorbing resin from falling off the cellulose fiber. The compression is preferably carried out on heating at, for example, 50Â° C to 200*C inclusive.<br>
The water absorbing resin of the present embodiment, when vised in the water absorbent core, exhibits excellent physical properties; the resultant water absorbent core is of \rery excellent quality in that it can quickly absorb liquid, leaving only a little liquid on its surface.<br>
The water absorbing resin of the present embodiment has an excellent water absorption property and hence is applicable to water absorbing/retaining agents for various purposes: for example, water absorbing/retaining agents for absorbent articles ^ such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads, and medical pad*; agriculture/horticulture water retaining agents, such as bog moss replacements, soil conditioners, water retaining agents, and agricultural chemical enhancers; water retaining agents for construction purposes, such as dew inhibitors for interior wall materials and cement additives; release controlling agents;   cold   insulators;   disposable   pocket   stoves;   sludge<br><br>
coa.gula.ting agent; food freshness retaining agents; ton exchange column materialÂ®; sludge/oil dehydrateÂ®; dcsi.ccan.ts; and humidity conditioning agents, in addition, the water absorbing resin of the present embodiment in especially suitable for use in disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and like sanitary/hygienic materials for absorbing feces, urine, or blood.<br>
Where the water absorbent core is used in sanitary/hygienic materials, such as disposable â¢ diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads, and medical pads, it is preferable if the core is placed between (a) a top sheet, permeable to liquid, provided next to the body of the user and (b) a back sheet, impermeable to liquid, provided next to the clothes of the user away from the body of the user, The water absorbent core may be multi-layered {two- or more layers). Further, the core may be used with a pulp layer as an example.<br>
Examples<br>
The following will more specifically describe the present invention by way of examples. The examples are by no means limiting the present invention. Throughout the following,, "mass parts" may be written simply as "parts" and "liter" as "1/ only for the sake of convenience. Also, "mass %H may be written as *wt%&gt;"<br><br>
The performance of the water absorbing resin was measured by the following methods. Unless otherwise specified, alt the measurements were conducted at room temperature |20 to 2S"C) and SO RH% humidity.<br>
In the cases of the water absorbing resin being used in an end product, such aÂ® a sanitary/hygienic material, the water absorbing renin had already absorbed moisture. The water absorbing resin was therefore separated appropriately from the end product and dried under reduced pressure and at low temperature (for example, under 1 mniHg or lower and at 60Â°C for 12 houfi} before measurements were made. All the water absorbing resins used in the examples and the comparative examples contained 94 mass % or more solid content.<br>
Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CEC)<br>
Centrifuge retention, capacity, or CRC, is absorption capacity   for   0.9Q  mass   %   saline  under   no   load   over  30<br>
minutes.  CRC  may be  referred  to as  "absorption   capacity under no load,"<br>
0.200 g of the water absorbing resin was placed evenly in a bag (85 mm x 60 mm) of nonÂ« woven fabric fHeatron Paper* GSP-22, manufactured by Nangoku Puip Kogyo Co,, Ltd,J, After heat scaling* the bag was immersed in a largely excessive amount (typically about 500 mL) of 0.90 mass %<br><br>
saline (aqueous solution of sodium chloride) at room temperature. After 30 minutes, the bag was taken out of the â  saline and eentrifuged for 3 minuteÂ® in a centrifugal separator ("Centrifuge H-122," manufactured by Kokusan Co.,. Ltd.) under centrifugal force described in edana ABSORBENCY II 441.1*99 (250 G). The mass, Wl (g), of the bag was then measured. The same process was carried out using no water aba-orbing resin, and the mass, WO (g), of the bag was measured. The centrifuge retention capacity CRC was calculated in grams per gram from Wl, WO as given by the following equations:<br>
Centrifuge Retention Capacity CRC (g/g) - (Wl (gj - WO (g}} / (Mass (g) of Water Absorbing Resin) - 1<br>
Absorbency Against Pressure of 4.83 kPa (AAP)<br>
Absorbency against pressure, or AAP, is absorption capacity for 0.90 mass % saline under 4.83 kPa over 60 minutes. AAP may be referred to as absorption capacity under<br>
4-83   kPa.   Figure  3   is  a  cross-sectional  view  of an  AAP measurement apparatus 10.<br>
In the measurement apparatus 10 shown in Pigure 3, a 4QQ-mesh stainless steel net 101 (mesh size 38 um) was fused to the bottom of a plastic supporter cylinder 100 that had an internal diameter of 60 mm, 0.900 g of the water absorbing resin was sprayed evenly on the net 101 at room temperature<br><br>
(from 20"C to 25*C inclusive) and 50 RH% humidity. A piston 103 and a weight 104 were placed in this order on the water absorbing resin, or the test sample 102. The piston 103 and weight 104 had an external diameter slightly less than 60 mm so that there occurred no gap between them and the supporter cylinder 100 and their up and down motion was not disturbed. The piston 103 and weight 104 were adjusted so that they could apply a 4,83 kPa (0,7 psi) load evenly, The mass, Wa (g), of the entire measurement apparatus 10 was measured.<br>
A glass filter 106 measuring 90 mm in diameter (manufactured by Sogo Laboratory Glass Works Co., Ltd4 pore diameter 100 to 120 urn) was placed Inside a petri dish 105 measuring 150 mm. in diameter, 0.9O mass % saline 108 {from 20Â°C to 25Â°C inclusive) was poured until it sit level with the top face of the glass filter 106, A paper filter 107 'measuring 90 mm. in diameter (MIS P 3801, Ho. 2," Advantec Toyo Kaisha.,, Ltd*; thickness 0*26 mm, retainable particle diameter 5 urn) was placed on. the filter 106 so that the surface of the filter 107 could, 'be all wet. Excess solution was removed.<br>
The whole measurement apparatus 10 was placed on the wet paper filter so that it could absorb the solution... under load. After I hour, the whole measurement apparatus 10 was lifted, and its mass Wb fg) was measured. The absorhency<br><br>
under 4,83 kPa (AAP) was calculated in grama per gram from Wa, Wb as given by the following equation;<br>
Absorbency under 4.83 kPa (AAP) Â« (Wb (g) - Wa (g)) / (Mass of Water Absorbing Resin (0,900 g))<br>
Saline Flow Conductivity (SFC)<br>
Saline flow conductivity, or SFCr is a value indicating liquid permeability of the water absorbing resin when it has swollen. The greater the SFC, the higher liquid permeability the water absorbing resin has. SPC tests were conducted in the examples as described in the Specification of U.S. Patent 5,849,405. Figure I is a schematic illustration of an SFC measurement apparatus 30.<br>
In the measurement apparatus 30 shown in Figure 1, a glass tube 32 was inserted into a tank 31. The lower end of the glass tube 32 was arranged so that 0.69 mass % saline 33 could be maintained 5 cm above the bottom of a gel 44 in a cell 41, The 0.69 mass % saline 33 in the tank 31 was fed to a cell 41 via an "L" tube 34 which has a valve 35. Under the cell 41 was provided a collector 48 which collected the solution that had passed through the cell 41. The collector 48 was placed on a balance 49. The cell 41 had an internal diameter of 6 cm and was provided with a Mo. 400 stainless steel net (mesh 38 umj 42 on the bottom. The piston 46 had, on its lower   part,   holes   47   through   which   the   solution   could<br><br>
properly pass. Also, the piston 46 had a high permeability glass filter 45 attached to its bottom BO that the water absorbing resin, or their swollen gel could not enter the holes 47. The cell 41 was placed on a base. The face of the base at which it contacted the cell 41 was disposed on a stainless steel net 43 which did not disturb the passing solution.<br>
Artificial mine (1) used here was a mixture of 0.25 g calcium chloride dihydrate, 2.0 g potassium chloride, O.50 g magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 2.0 g sodium sulfate, 0.85 g ammonium dihydrogenphosphate, 0,15 g diammonium hydrogenphosphate, arid 994,25 g pure water.<br>
The water absorbing resin (0.900 g) placed evenly in the container 40 was let to swell, using the measurement apparatus 30 shown in Figure lt in artificial urine (1) under a load of 2.07 kPa {0,3 psi) for 60 minutes to prepare the gel 44. Thereafter, the height of the layer of the gel 44 was recorded. Next, the 0.69 mass % saline 33 was passed through the swollen gel layer from the tank 31 under a load of 2.07 kPa (0.3 psi) at a constant hydrostatic pressure. The SPC test was conducted at room temperature (from 20"C to 25*C inclusive). The amount of liquid having passed through the gel layer was recorded using a computer and a scale as a function of time at 20 second intervals for 10 minutes. The flow rate Fs(T) at which the solution passed through the swollen gel 44 (primarily between the gel's particles) was determined in units<br><br>
of grams per second by dividing an increase in mass (g) by an increase in time {a). Flow rates were calculated only from the data obtained in the 10 minute period starting at time Ts at which a constant hydrostatic pressure and a stable flow rate were achieved. Fs{TÂ»0}^ or the first flow rate at which the solution passed through the gel layera was calculated from the flaw rates obtained in the 10 minute period starting at Ts. Fs(TÂ«0) was obtained by extrapolating, for T Â«â  0, the result of least square approximation of Ps{T)f vs, time. Saline Flow Conductivity {SFC]<br>
-	(FÂ«(T-0) x LO) / {p x A x AP)<br>
-	(Fs(T-O) * LO) / 139506<br>
where Fs(TmO) was the flow rate in grams per second; LO waa the height of the gel layer in centimeters; p was the density of the NaCI solution {Â» 1,003 g/cms); A was the area of the top face of the gel layer in the cell 31 {= 28,27 cm2); and AP was the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the gel layer (= 4920 dyne/em2}. The SFC values were given in units of 10-7'cm**B"g-*.<br>
Fixed Height Abaorbency {FHAJ<br>
Fixed Height Abaorbency, or FHA, was measured in accordance with the method described in U.S. Published Patent Application 2005/0003191A1. The height upon measurement was set to 20 cm in the present invention.<br><br>
Mass-average     Particle    Diameter    D50     and     Logarithmic Standard Deviation, oÂ£â of Particle Stee Distribution<br>
These two parameters were measured based on the tests for the mass-average particle diameter, or D50, and the logarithmic standard deviation, at,, of a particle sia&amp;e distribution described in International Application Published under PCT WO2004/69915.<br>
Liquid Distribution Velocity (LDV)<br>
Liquid distribution velocity, or LDV, was measured using a wieking index measurement apparatus described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 5-200068/1993 fTokukaifaei 5-200068; equivalent to EP 532002). The trough sheet was prepared by SUS304, stainless steel, grade 2B finish for measurement.<br>
First, 1.00 g Â± 0,005 g of the water absorbing resin was sprayed evenly from the 0 to 20 cm marks in trough grooves on a trough sheet disposed at an angle of 2Q*C. The water absorbing resin was then more evenly spread using a spatula.<br>
The liquid to be wicked away was 0.9 wt% saline (aqueous solution of sodium chloride) to which "*Blue No. 1 for Pood Testing* (available from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was added in a ratio of 0.01 g for every 1 L of the saline for coloring.<br>
Adjustment was made so that the liquid surface in, a liquid storage vessel was 0-5 cm above the lowest point in the trough. After that, measurement of a liquid wicking time {WT) was started right when the stainless steel screen, mesh (400-mesh.) contacted the liquid. The liquid wicking time (WT) was the time in seconds it took for the liquid to be wicked up to the 10 cm mark. The velocity at which the liquid in the liquid storage vessel and the stainless steel screen mesh were immersed down to 0.S cm above the lowest point in the trough was From 1.35 to 1.40 mm/s in the direction perpendicular to the liquid surface. The liquid distribution velocity (LDV) was calculated from the following equation:<br>
LDV (mm/s} - 100 (mm) / WT (s)<br>
Ratio of Particles of Sl*e* which Pass through 150*)im Meshes of Sieve<br>
The same classification process was performed as in the measurement of the mass-average particle diameter D50 and the logarithmic standard deviation, oÂ£, of a particle size distribution. The ratio in mass % of the particles of sissea that could pass through a sieve with 150-pim meshes was calculated from the amount of the particles that had passed through that sieve with the 150-um meshes,<br>

From Table 1* the thermally decomposing radical initiator content indices of the water-containing gels obtained in the examples of the indention ranged from 40 to 100. In contrast, those of the water-containing gels obtained in the comparative examples ranged from 29.1 to 36.2, which was out of the range of the present invention. In other words, the adoption of the step of polymerizing a water-soluble unsaturated monomer 0.06 to 5 mol% of which is composed of an internal erosslinking agent and the step of drying at 100 to 25G*C a water-containing gel which has a thermally decomposing radical initiator content index of 40 to 100 enables the proiiision of a water absorbing resin with excellent physical properties. Accordingly, the water absorbing resin of the present invention, if used, in a water absorbent core, forma a water absorbent core with excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time and high performance.<br><br><br><br>
From Tabic 2, the water absorbing resins obtained in the<br>
examples Â©f the invention had very well-balanced CRCs and SPCs when compared to the comparative water absorbing resins obtained in the comparative examples. This was also evident from the graph in Figure 2, Accordingly, the water<br>
absorbing resin of the present invention, if used in a water absorbent core, forms a water absorbent core with excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time and high performance,<br><br><br><br>
From Table 3, the intrinsic viscosities, IV, of the water absorbing resins obtained in the examples of the invention after the treatment at such a weight-average molecular weight Mw that Log (Mw-J - fi.10 were 7.3 dL/g or lower. Meanwhile, those of the comparative water Absorbing resins obtained in the comparative examples were all 7.3 dL/g or higher. These differences appear to indicate improvement of the internal structure of the water absorbing resins. In other words, the use of a water absorbing resin of which the intrinsic -viscosity IV is 7,3 dL/g or lower after the treatment at such a weight-average molecular weight Mw that Log (Mw) - 6JO enables the previaion of a water absorbing resin with excellent physical properties, as can be seen from the results shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Accordingly, the water absorbing resin of the present invention, if used in a water absorbent core, forms a water absorbent core with excellent liquid acquisition rate per unit time and high performance.<br>
