				<td>METHOD OF RADIO INTERFACE ORGANIZATION AND BASE<br>
8TATIQN IN CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to radio engineering, and more<br>
particularly to the method of radio interface organization and base station<br>
equipment in CDMA communication system, which provide continuous<br>
connection between mobile stations (MS) and base station (BS).<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A mobile cellular radio communication system should serve a<br>
maximal number of simultaneously operating mobile stations with the<br>
specified quality of transmit and receive information, i.e. provide the<br>
maximal system capacity. At the same time, it is necessary to provide a<br>
minimal level of mutual interference both between MS and cells. This can<br>
be achieved, first, by reducing the power of BS and MS transmit-receive<br>
antenna electromagnetic radiation to the minimum acceptable level and,<br>
second, by optimal placing BS transmit-receive antennas and orientation<br>
of their antenna patterns.<br>
The book (see Ratynski M.V. Basics of Cellular Communication,<br>
Library of Cellular Communication series, BEELINE Cellular<br>
Communication, Moscow, Radio and Communication, 2000 (pp. 19-24,<br>
55-57) contains a systematic overview of the basic aspects of modern<br>
cellular communication, conventional description and schematic<br>
presentation of a standard communication system, description and<br>
illustration of the procedure of a mobile station handoff by base stations<br>
when crossing cell borders.<br>
Under conditions of limited bandwidth of operation frequencies<br>
assigned to mobile communication systems, the number of users can be<br>
increased through repeated use of operation frequencies, space and time<br>
diversity of the radiated signals, and application of effective modulation<br>
methods.<br>
There is no universal solution to this task. In each specific case it<br>
should be treated differently.<br>
An invention has been proposed (see WO 98/12889 "Base Station<br>
and Process of Powering a Cell of a Cellular Mobile Radio System", H 04<br>
Q 7/36, H 04 B 7/06, published March 26, 1998), which describes the<br>
method and device of radio interface organization in GSM system (Global<br>
System for Mobile Communication).<br>
There are two possible embodiments of this invention aimed to<br>
increase overall system capacity:<br>
according to the first embodiment, additional space diversity of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas is performed at the cell periphery;<br>
according to the second embodiment, sectorization of BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna, located in the cell center, is carried out.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the solution, L BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas are placed at the cell periphery. Communication<br>
channels between BS and MS are formed, thus providing additional space<br>
diversity of BS signal. When organizing radio interface between BS and<br>
MS, time and frequency multiplexing is used.<br>
To serve N simultaneously operating MS by all L BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas, there should be N different carrier frequencies at all BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas. From the description of the given invention it<br>
follows that the number of carrier frequencies can be reduced through<br>
their switching by planning the load of each channel of diversity reception<br>
from BS to MS. The channel load depends on specific characteristics of<br>
each cell. Depending on the channel load, the required number of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas is determined. BS channels are connected or<br>
disconnected depending on the quality of signal transmission via BS-MS<br>
connection on the whole, when the quality of signal transmission is<br>
evaluated by all communication channels or by the quality of signal<br>
transmission in separate channels. In case of inappropriate connection<br>
quality, additional BS channels can be connected or the channels with the<br>
worst transmission quality can be removed. Thus the economy of carrier<br>
frequencies is achieved in order to provide connection with a larger<br>
number of end users.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the solution, BS contains<br>
sector transmit-receive antennas located in the cell center. Sector<br>
transmit-receive antennas form BS channels and are oriented in such a<br>
way that the cell to which BS belongs is divided into sectors. In this case,<br>
sectors of separate neighboring BS transmit-receive antennas are<br>
overlapped in such a way that one MS could be connected to at least two<br>
sector transmit-receive antennas.<br>
Such cell division into sectors allows reducing mutual influence of<br>
signals from neighboring sectors, thus reducing the amount of mutual<br>
interference. It also allows using one and the same carrier frequency for<br>
MS in different non-overlapping sectors.<br>
To implement this algorithm, BS sector antennas are connected to<br>
separate transceivers. Transceivers, in their turn, are connected to<br>
switching device by means of which sector antenna channels are selected<br>
through commutation and their switch, i.e. control, is carried out<br>
depending on the load.<br>
With this structure of cellular communication system, owing to BS<br>
channel switching, the number of frequency channels in BS transmitreceive<br>
sector antennas, involved in a communication session with a<br>
specific MS, becomes reduced. BS transmit-receive sector antennas which<br>
are not used in a communication session with a given MS become<br>
disconnected and are used for other purposes, for example, connection<br>
with other MS. Hence, the present technical solution provides cell<br>
resource economy and increases system capacity by means of additionally<br>
assigned frequency band.<br>
However, placing BS transmit-receive antennas at the cell<br>
periphery only, as proposed in the mentioned method, in real operation<br>
conditions means the following disadvantages:<br>
- irregular distribution of BS transmit-receive antenna<br>
electromagnetic radiation power within a cell and occurrence of signal<br>
shadow areas, the so called "dead zones", where no connection between<br>
BS and MS is possible (see Microwave Mobile Communications. Edited<br>
by William C. Jakes. Reissued in cooperation with the IEEE<br>
Communications Society. Press NY, 1994, chapters 2, 7).<br>
- low quality of connection between BS and MS in the zones of<br>
depression of the electromagnetic radiation field strength, thus requiring<br>
increased radiation power of BS and MS transmit-receive antennas;<br>
- impossibility to provide the required, i.e. potential, cell capacity<br>
in case of irregular MS distribution across the cell square.<br>
The proposed sectorization of BS transmit-receive antenna<br>
radiation, located in the cell center, with the specified radio interface<br>
organization does not eliminate essential interference of BS and MS<br>
signals from neighboring cells.<br>
The structure of the cellular communication system and control<br>
algorithm proposed in the above technical solution are not universal and<br>
designed for GSM standard systems only.<br>
CDMA base station equipment (see patent US N° 5,103,459<br>
«System and Method for Generating Signal Waveforms in a CDMA<br>
Cellular Telephone System», Fig. 2, Int. Cl.5 H 04 L 27/30) has been<br>
proposed, which contains device for MS signal reception and device for<br>
signal transmission. Device for MS signal reception consists of two<br>
receive antennas intended for MS signal reception and two corresponding<br>
analog-digital receivers, at least two searchers and three data receivers,<br>
signal combining unit with a decoder, control processor, and digital data<br>
transmission channel. Device for BS signals transmission contains<br>
sequentially connected modulator, power control unit, summator,<br>
transmitter power amplifier connected to pilot signal unit, and antenna for<br>
information transmission in the reverse channel.<br>
The mentioned device operates in the following way. A group<br>
signal, which is a sum of mobile station signals, located within the service<br>
zone of a given receive antenna, arrives at each BS receive antenna.<br>
Group signal energy at the input of each BS receive antenna equals the<br>
sum of signal energies from each of MS and is an average characteristic<br>
of the communication channel. In the analog-digital receiver, these<br>
signals are transformed into a digital form and supplied to the input of<br>
searchers and data receivers. Searchers scan the uncertainty area and<br>
detect MS signals. Having detected MS signal, searchers pass the<br>
information to control processor. Control processor estimates the<br>
information signals supplied from receivers and passes control signals to<br>
data receivers. Data receivers process the received signal through control<br>
signal and pass the processed signal to signal combining unit with<br>
decoder. Signal combining unit with decoder performs operations of<br>
diversity reception of signals from each specific MS, supplied from data<br>
receivers, decodes them and passes to the user network.<br>
Information signal from the user network, transformed considering<br>
the reverse channel characteristics, via modulator, power control unit,<br>
summator, and transmitter power amplifier is supplied to transmit<br>
antenna.<br>
However, the above device and its algorithm do not allow for<br>
implementation of the required, i.e. potential, cell capacity in case of<br>
irregular MS distribution across the cell square.<br>
Finally, an invention has been proposed (see EP 0 817 406 "Mobile<br>
Communication System with Improved Antenna Arrangement" Int. Cl.<br>
H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36), with several embodiments of BS antenna system<br>
organization in each cell. In this technical solution, BS contains a<br>
multiplicity of transmit-receive antennas located along the cell border and<br>
have directivity characteristics oriented to the cell center.<br>
According to the first embodiment, each of the three BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas has directivity characteristics oriented to cover 120<br>
degree sectors of the cell square. BS transmit-receive antennas are located<br>
along the cell border with the angle interval of 120 degrees.<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas can also be located in another way.<br>
One of them, the central BS transmit-receive antenna, has directivity<br>
characteristic covering 60 degree sector of the cell square and the other<br>
two BS transmit-receive antennas have directivity characteristics covering<br>
120 degree sectors of the cell square and are located at the two sides of<br>
the central antenna. All BS transmit-receive antennas are located along<br>
the cell border with the angle intervals of 60 degrees.<br>
According to the second embodiment of this antenna system, the<br>
central BS transmit-receive antenna has directivity characteristic covering<br>
120 degree sector of the cell square and each of the two BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas at the two sides of the central BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna has directivity characteristic covering 60 degree sectors of the<br>
cell square. All BS transmit-receive antennas are located along the cell<br>
border with the angle intervals of 60 degrees.<br>
The preferred embodiment is when BS transmit-receive antennas<br>
have directivity characteristics oriented to cover 120 degree sectors of the<br>
cell square and are located with the intervals of 60 degrees along the cell<br>
border and the undirected BS transmit-receive antenna is in the cell<br>
center.<br>
The given invention compared to the previous technical solution in<br>
the second embodiment eases the difficulties of system frequency<br>
resource utilization that arise due to the technique of organization of the<br>
cellular communication system featuring BS sector combined circular<br>
pattern transmit-receive antennas located in the cell center.<br>
In the mentioned patent (see EP 0 817 406 "Mobile<br>
Communication System with Improved Antenna Arrangement" Int. Cl.<br>
H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36), along with the description of embodiments of BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna organization in each cell, the issues of providing<br>
regular cell square coverage by electromagnetic radiation power are<br>
indirectly touched and certain structures of signal processing at BS and<br>
MS are considered, (see Fig. 8 -20, pp. 15-21 Patent specification).<br>
Let us consider, for example, Fig. 20 on p. 21 of the Patent<br>
description. Fig. 20 shows the multifunction structure of BS. In the given<br>
application, the device is presented on Fig. 1.<br>
The device of Fig. 1 consists of:<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas - l j - 1L,<br>
Signal diversity unit 2,<br>
Signal combining unit 3,<br>
Channel estimation unit 4,<br>
Receive signal processing and transmit signal forming unit 5,<br>
Modulator amplifier 6,<br>
Transmission diversity control unit 7.<br>
This device operates in the following way. A group signal, which is<br>
a sum of signals of mobile stations located within the service zone of a<br>
given BS transmit-receive antenna, arrives at each BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna l j - 1L. Group signal energy at the input of each BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna li - IL equals the sum of signal energies from each of MS<br>
and is an average characteristic of the communication channel. Via signal<br>
diversity unit 2, these signals are supplied to channel estimation unit 4<br>
and signal combining unit 3. Signal combining unit 3 performs an<br>
operation of diversity signal reception from each specific MS which<br>
arrives from signal diversity unit 2, in order to provide a resultant signal<br>
at the input of receive signal processing and transmit signal forming unit<br>
5 with a maximal signal-to-noise ratio. Unit 5 demodulates the input<br>
signal and transmits it to the user network. Channel estimation unit 4<br>
estimates the strength of the group signal in each of the channels received<br>
by BS transmit-receive antennas l j - 1L. Quality reception at MS can be<br>
achieved by correction of the signal transmitted from BS, according to the<br>
received estimation of the communication channel state.<br>
In particular, in TDD communication system, signals of the forward<br>
and reverse communication channels are transmitted and received at one<br>
and the same frequency. Hence, the forward and reverse channel<br>
characteristics are the same. The process of BS transmitter signal<br>
correction is as follows.<br>
Information signal from the network is supplied via unit 5 to unit 6,<br>
where the signal for transmission in the reverse channel is generated.<br>
Then, the signal arrives at unit 7 which transforms it according to<br>
the estimated state characteristics of communication channels that were<br>
obtained as a result of estimation in unit 4. The output signal from unit <br>
arrives via unit 2 at BS transmit-receive antennas li - 1L..<br>
Regular space distribution of BS transmit-receive antennas along<br>
the border only or along the border and in the cell center, as proposed in<br>
the mentioned invention, in real operation conditions leads to the<br>
following drawbacks:<br>
irregular distribution of BS transmit-receive antenna<br>
radiation power within a cell and decrease in connection quality between<br>
BS and MS;<br>
occurrence of signal shadow areas, the so called "dead<br>
zones", where no connection between BS and MS is possible;<br>
low quality of connection between BS and MS in the zones<br>
of depression of the electromagnetic radiation field strength, thus<br>
requiring increased electromagnetic radiation power of BS and MS<br>
transmit-receive antennas;<br>
impossibility to provide the required, i.e. potential, cell<br>
capacity in case of irregular MS distribution across the cell square.<br>
The above drawbacks are clearly illustrated on Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C.<br>
Consider them in more detail.<br>
Fig. 2A shows 3D graphic presentation of coverage of cell square<br>
by the electromagnetic radiation power of BS transmit-receive antennas,<br>
which was obtained through computer simulation, with BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas placed along the border and in the cell center, when BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas have directivity characteristics oriented to cover<br>
120 degree sectors of the cell square and are located along the cell border<br>
with the intervals of 60 degrees, the undirected BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna placed in the cell center.<br>
Fig. 2B shows section projections of equal levels of<br>
electromagnetic radiation power to the horizontal plane for the threedimensional<br>
object shown on Fig. 2A.<br>
Fig. 2C shows section projections of equal levels of<br>
electromagnetic radiation power to the horizontal plane for the threedimensional<br>
object shown on Fig. 2A. Conditionally, the case is<br>
demonstrated where in a cell the "dead zone" D occurs generated by a<br>
block of high buildings, constructed, for example, in a form of a "closed<br>
rectangle". On Fig. 2C this zone is shadowed. MS located in this zone is<br>
inaccessible for communication even to the nearest BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas AI, A4, A5, and A6.<br>
Accepted denotations on Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B:<br>
AI -BS transmit-receive antenna placed in the cell center,<br>
A2 - A7 - BS transmit-receive antennas located along the cell<br>
border,<br>
Accepted denotations on Fig. 2C:<br>
AI - BS transmit-receive antenna placed in the cell center,<br>
A2 - A7 - BS transmit-receive antennas located along the cell<br>
border,<br>
D - "dead zone".<br>
From Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C it can be seen that with such location<br>
of BS transmit-receive antennas, the cell square coverage by<br>
electromagnetic radiation power is irregular, due to which additional<br>
problems of signal reception in "dead zones" may arise.<br>
Simulation of this method has shown that, in the ideal case, where<br>
the environment of radio-wave distribution is isotropic and there are no<br>
signal shadow areas, the irregularity of cell square coverage by<br>
electromagnetic radiation power becomes substantially reduced compared<br>
to the conventional transmit-receive antenna location in the cell center.<br>
Improved distribution of electromagnetic radiation power is especially<br>
evident from the vertical sections of the three-dimensional image of Fig.<br>
2A. The vertical sections of Fig. 2A are shown on Fig. 3 A, 3B, and 3C.<br>
Consider Fig. 3A that illustrates distribution of BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna electromagnetic radiation power in the vertical section passing<br>
through BS transmit-receive antennas A2 - AI - A5.<br>
Fig. 3A shows:<br>
by dotted line - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power P0<br>
in a cell, with the conventional BS transmit-receive antenna location in<br>
the cell center, where Preq. - minimal power level of electromagnetic<br>
radiation, determined by the corresponding standards for radio<br>
communication and required to provide quality connection with MS<br>
within cell borders;<br>
by curves a, b, c - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power<br>
in a cell from BS transmit-receive antennas, from A2 - AI - A5<br>
respectively;<br>
by curve d - resultant value of the electromagnetic radiation power<br>
distribution curve in a cell from BS transmit-receive antennas;<br>
R - cell radius.<br>
Consider Fig. 3B, which illustrates distribution of BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna electromagnetic radiation power in the vertical section<br>
passing through BS transmit-receive antennas A2 - AI - A5) in case of a<br>
"dead zone" D, generated by a block of high buildings, constructed, for<br>
example, in a form of a "closed rectangle".<br>
Fig. 3 B shows:<br>
by dotted line - minimal power level of the electromagnetic<br>
radiation Preq. determined by the corresponding standards for radio<br>
communication and required to provide quality connection with MS<br>
within cell borders;<br>
by curve d - resultant distribution of electromagnetic radiation<br>
power in a cell from BS transmit-receive antennas, when the "dead zone"<br>
D is absent;<br>
by curve d' - resultant distribution of electromagnetic radiation<br>
power in a cell from BS transmit-receive antennas, in case of "dead zone"<br>
D occurence.<br>
Consider Fig. 3C that illustrates distribution of electromagnetic<br>
radiation power of MS transmit-receive antenna in the vertical section,<br>
passing through BS transmit-receive antennas A2 - AI - A5&gt; for the cases<br>
when MS is located in the "dead zone" D and when the "dead zone" is<br>
absent.<br>
Fig. 3C shows:<br>
by dotted line - minimal power level of the electromagnetic<br>
radiation Preq., determined by the corresponding standards for radio<br>
communication and required to provide quality connection with MS<br>
within cell borders;<br>
by curve «f» - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power of<br>
MS transmit-receive antenna, in case the "dead zone" D is absent,<br>
by curve «e» - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power of<br>
MS transmit-receive antenna in case MS is within the "dead zone" D.<br>
From the resultant curve d on Fig. 3A, it can be seen that, within a<br>
cell, the total power level of electromagnetic radiation of BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas located along the border and in the cell center, compared<br>
to the conventional central placing, has reduced, though substantial<br>
irregularity has remained.<br>
From the resultant curves «d» and «d'» on Fig. 3B, it can be seen<br>
that in the "dead zone" D the total power level of electromagnetic<br>
radiation of BS transmit-receive antennas reduces sharply thus rendering<br>
the connection between BS and the user located within this zone<br>
impossible.<br>
From the resultant curves «f» and «e» on Fig. 3C, it can be seen<br>
that the power level of electromagnetic radiation of MS transmit-receive<br>
antenna, located within the "dead zone" D, reduces sharply outside this<br>
zone thus rendering the connection between MS and nearest BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas AI, A5 impossible.<br>
Therefore, with the proposed in the patent (see EP 0 817 406<br>
"Mobile Communication System with Improved Antenna Arrangement"<br>
Int. Cl. H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36) geometry of placing BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna system, intended to provide connection between BS and MS,<br>
located within the "dead zone" D, the power of electromagnetic radiation<br>
must be substantially increased, both from BS transmit-receive antennas<br>
and MS transmit-receive antennas. This leads to irrational use of BS and<br>
MS resources and increases the noise level for other users.<br>
Note that all the above described examples of covering the cell<br>
square by the power of electromagnetic radiation of BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas do not solve one more important problem. This problem is<br>
connected with irregular MS distribution across the cell square, which can<br>
occur both occasionally and predictably. To such zones of MS irregular<br>
distribution across the cell square belong the areas of increased MS<br>
concentration, further referred to as "1C". These are public places, for<br>
example, stadiums, exhibitions, trade fairs, shopping centers, railway<br>
stations and airports, busy motorways and so on.<br>
Beside the geographical position of these areas in a cell, the seasonday<br>
activity of mobile stations in these areas can be predicted rather<br>
accurately.<br>
High user concentration on limited squares leads to BS overload in<br>
these cell zones, whereas the optimal mode of resource use is achieved<br>
through regular load of BS transmit-receive antennas.<br>
Fig. 4 shows possible embodiment of MS placing across the cell<br>
square, in case in real conditions the mode of BS overload occurs.<br>
For example, as proposed in the mentioned invention (see EP 0 817<br>
406 "Mobile Communication System with Improved Antenna<br>
Arrangement" Int. Cl. H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36), the cell square is divided<br>
into seven service zones, where BS transmit-receive antennas AI - A7, are<br>
placed, and the whole square is covered by the power of electromagnetic<br>
radiation.<br>
Each of BS transmit-receive antennas has limited resources for MS<br>
quality service, for example, 35 MS.<br>
Fig 4 shows that at some point of time in each of the seven service<br>
zones there is, for example, the following number of simultaneously<br>
operating MS, denotated by the corresponding numbers:<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna AI - 35 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A2 -10 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna AS - 30 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A4 - 7 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A5 - 25 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A6 - 20 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A7 - 50 MS.<br>
In the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A7&gt; 30 out of 50<br>
MS are located on a limited predictable square of increased concentration<br>
"1C". Due to the resource deficiency, BS transmit-receive antenna A7 can<br>
serve no more than thirty-five MS. Hence, fifteen out of fifty mobile<br>
stations will be denied service.<br>
Therefore, such method and device should be created that would<br>
allow serving maximal number of simultaneously operating mobile<br>
stations with specified quality of information transmission and reception,<br>
i.e. would provide maximal system capacity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The goal of the present invention is to create the method of radio<br>
interface organization and base station for a cellular communication<br>
system that improve communication system capacity and receive and<br>
transmit information quality for a larger number of simultaneously<br>
operating users.<br>
The object is attained by the method of cellular communication<br>
system radio interface organization consisting in that a territory served by<br>
a communication system is divided into cells adjacent to one another, a<br>
base station and a multiplicity of transmit-receive antennas are placed in<br>
every cell, connection between transmit-receive antennas and a cell base<br>
station is provided, handoff during a mobile station travel across cells is<br>
provided, according to the claimed invention:<br>
location of base station transmit-receive antennas, orientation of<br>
antenna patterns, and power of their electromagnetic radiation are selected<br>
so that the maximum regular distribution of electromagnetic radiation<br>
power within a cell and minimal noise level for neighboring cells are<br>
provided on the one hand, and, on the other one, the maximum regular<br>
distribution of mobile stations is achieved between coverage zones of<br>
different base station transmit-receive antennas,<br>
connection is provided between the mobile stations within a cell<br>
area and the base station that serves this cell via those base station<br>
transmit-receive antennas in whose electromagnetic radiation power<br>
coverage zone the corresponding mobile stations are placed,<br>
handoff during a mobile station travel across cells is provided via<br>
those base station transmit-receive antennas, in the service zone of which<br>
the corresponding mobile stations are located.<br>
While organizing a cellular communications system radio interface<br>
it is preferable to provide, for example, orthogonality of the signals<br>
radiated by different base station transmit-receive antennas, and soft<br>
handoff within a cell during a mobile station travel from the service zone<br>
these groups of base station transmit-receive antennas to the service zone<br>
those groups of base station transmit-receive antennas.<br>
The groups are understood to be a set of BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas through which connection with MS is conducted within a given<br>
interval.<br>
The goal of the invention is further attained through the following.<br>
Cellular communication system base station comprising L transmitreceive<br>
antennas, signal diversity unit, MS signal path combining unit,<br>
channel estimation unit, receive signal processing and transmit signal<br>
forming unit, modulator amplifier, and signal transmission diversity<br>
control unit; the inputs of transmit-receive antennas are at the same time<br>
the device signal inputs and their outputs are connected to the<br>
corresponding first inputs of signal diversity unit, the outputs of signal<br>
diversity unit are connected to the first inputs of mobile station signal<br>
path combining unit, the first outputs of which are connected to the first<br>
inputs of receive signal processing and transmit signal forming unit, the<br>
first outputs of which are the outputs of the device, second inputs of<br>
receive signal processing and transmit signal forming unit are the inputs<br>
of the user signal, second inputs of receive signal processing and transmit<br>
signal forming unit are connected to the inputs of modulator amplifier, the<br>
outputs of which are connected to the first inputs of signal transmission<br>
diversity control unit, the second inputs of which are connected to the<br>
outputs of channel estimation unit, the outputs of signal transmission<br>
diversity control unit are connected to the second inputs of signal<br>
diversity unit, the outputs of which are connected to transmit-receive<br>
antennas, is added with the following:<br>
signal path search unit, conducting search of all mobile station<br>
signal paths,<br>
control processor, forming control signals at the first outputs setting<br>
the form and phase of the pseudorandom sequence for all mobile station<br>
signal paths, at the second outputs the control signals of reference signal<br>
selection for detected signal paths of mobile stations, at the third outputs -<br>
control signals of reference signal selection of detected mobile station<br>
signal paths, corrected considering time delays,<br>
the first inputs of signal path search unit are combined with the first<br>
inputs of mobile station signal path combining unit and connected to the<br>
outputs of signal diversity unit, the outputs of signal path search unit are<br>
connected to the inputs of the control processor, the first outputs of which<br>
are connected to the second inputs of signal path search unit, the second<br>
outputs of control processor are connected to the second inputs of mobile<br>
station signal path combining unit, the third outputs of the control<br>
processor are connected to the first inputs of channel estimation unit, the<br>
second inputs of which are connected to the second outputs of mobile<br>
station signal path combining unit.<br>
The newly proposed sequence of method operations allows for the<br>
following:<br>
serve maximal number of simultaneously operating mobile stations<br>
with specified quality of information transmission and reception; this<br>
being achieved through the maximum regular distribution of<br>
electromagnetic radiation power within a cell and minimal noise level to<br>
neighboring cells, on the one hand, and the maximum regular distribution<br>
of mobile stations between coverage zones of different base station<br>
transmit-receive antennas, on the other one,<br>
provide high-quality communication between mobile stations<br>
within a cell area and the base station serving this cell; this being<br>
achieved through providing communication established via those base<br>
station transmit-receive antennas, in whose electromagnetic radiation<br>
power coverage zone the corresponding mobile stations are located,<br>
efficiently conduct handoff during a mobile station travel across<br>
cells; handoff being carried out via those base station transmit-receive<br>
antennas, in whose service zone the corresponding mobile stations are<br>
located,<br>
provide minimal noise level to neighboring cells; this being<br>
achieved through orientation of electromagnetic radiation inwardly within<br>
a cell for BS transmit-receive antennas, located in the proximity of a cell<br>
border and selection of BS transmit-receive antenna patterns, located in<br>
"dead zones" and areas of increased MS concentration "1C", and<br>
redistribution of electromagnetic radiation power between BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas, which reduces the total power level of electromagnetic<br>
radiation to the minimum acceptable one.<br><br>
Therefore, the newly proposed sequence of method operations improved communication system capacity.<br>
BS quality signal reception from mobile stations is impossible without search for signals and their estimation. At BS, MS signal search and estimation mode should be provided, consequently in the filed base station equipment signal search unit and control processor, which adjusts the process of MS signal reception and transmission considering the radio channel characteristics, are introduced.<br>
It is said in the description of the mentioned patent (see EP 0 817 406 "Mobile Communication System with Improved Antenna Arrangement" Int. CI. H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36), that BS (Fig. 1) comprises search unit and control processor. However, even if we assume that MS signal path combining unit and channel estimation unit comprise search units and control processors, it means that each of these units comprises at least one search unit and control processor, which makes the device more complex.<br>
Moreover, the absence of links between signal combining unit 3 and channel estimation unit 4 (Fig. 1) shows that in the mentioned device operation in the receive channel and transmit channel is not coordinated. It means that MS signal detection and channel estimation take place separately in each of these channels, which can lead to degradation of MS signal reception and transmission quality.<br>
Introduction of signal path search unit, searching for all mobile station signal paths, and control processor which adjusts the process of MS signal reception and transmission considering the radio channel characteristics in the claimed device allows BS quality reception and transmission of MS signals.-<br><br>

The method of radio interface organization in the cellular<br>
communication system according to the present invention is described<br>
below with references to the foresaid device and Fig. 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7,<br>
and 8.<br>
The territory served by the communication system is divided into<br>
neighboring cells.<br>
BS and a multiplicity of transmit-receive antennas are placed in<br>
each cell.<br>
Location of BS transmit-receive antennas, orientation of antenna<br>
patterns, and the power of electromagnetic radiation are selected so that,<br>
on the one hand, maximum regular distribution of electromagnetic<br>
radiation power within a cell and minimal noise level for neighboring<br>
cells are provided, and on the other hand, maximum regular distribution<br>
of mobile stations between coverage zones of different base station<br>
transmit-receive antennas is provided.<br>
Connection of transmit-receive antennas with the cell base station<br>
is provided.<br>
Connection between mobile stations located on the cell territory<br>
and the base station, serving the given cell via those base station transmitreceive<br>
antennas, in the electromagnetic radiation power coverage zone of<br>
which the corresponding mobile stations are located, is provided. Then,<br>
for example, signal orthogonality, radiated by different BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas, is provided.<br>
Handoff during a mobile station travel between cells is provided<br>
via those base station transmit-receive antennas, in the service zone of<br>
which the corresponding mobile stations are located. Then soft handoff<br>
within a cell should be provided during a mobile station travel from the<br>
zone of serving some groups of base station transmit-receive antennas to<br>
the zone of serving other groups of BS transmit-receive antennas.<br>
Consider Fig. 5A, that illustrates conditionally an exemplary<br>
organization of radio interface in the cellular communication system by<br>
the filed method for ideal conditions and ideal cell form, when BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas are located along the border, in the cell center,<br>
and in the local minima of electromagnetic radiation power, orientation of<br>
their antenna patterns is conducted so that maximum regular distribution<br>
of electromagnetic radiation power within a cell and minimal noise level<br>
for neighboring cells are provided.<br>
Fig. 5A shows:<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna AI is, for example, in the cell center,<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas A2 - A7 are along the cell border,<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas A8- - AJ3' - are in the local minima of<br>
the electromagnetic radiation power.<br>
The distinctive feature of this exemplary BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna location in relation to the proposed technical solution (see EP 0<br>
817 406 "Mobile Communication System with Improved Antenna<br>
Arrangement" Int. Cl. H04B 7/26, H04Q7/36) is that BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas are located in the local minima of the electromagnetic radiation<br>
power distribution (whereas in the proposed technical solution - in the<br>
center and along the cell border). The proposed approach reduces<br>
interference between MS and between neighboring cells and improves<br>
MS connection quality, owing to signal diversity reception.<br>
Note that the given exemplary embodiment of the claimed method,<br>
shown on Fig. 5A, can be used in practice in real conditions, both for the<br>
case of symmetrical location of BS transmit-receive antennas in local<br>
minima and for the case of unsymmetrical location of transmit-receive<br>
antennas in local minima.<br>
Fig. 5B illustrates the advantage of the filed method compared to<br>
the known invention and shows how the distribution of BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna power of electromagnetic radiation changes, when BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas A8 - AJ3 are additionally placed in local minima<br>
of electromagnetic radiation power. The curve of BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna magnetic radiation power distribution is shown in the same<br>
vertical section as in the known invention (Fig. 3A), i.e. in the section<br>
passing through BS transmit-receive antennas A2- Aj - A5<br>
On Fig. 5B it is denoted:<br>
by dotted line - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power P0<br>
in a cell with conventional BS transmit-receive antenna location in the<br>
cell center, where Preq. - minimal level of electromagnetic radiation<br>
power, determined by the corresponding standards for radio<br>
communication, necessary to provide quality connection with MS within<br>
a cell;<br>
curves a, b, c, e, f illustrate distribution of electromagnetic radiation<br>
power from BS transmit-receive antennas A2 - A! - A5, AIQ - AH, and A8<br>
-An;<br>
curve d - resultant distribution of electromagnetic radiation power;<br>
R - cell radius.<br>
From the resultant curve of electromagnetic radiation power<br>
distribution d, it can be seen that the irregularity of electromagnetic<br>
radiation power distribution (compared to the known invention (see Fig.<br>
3A) is removed by placing BS transmit-receive antennas in local minima.<br>
At the same time, further reducing the power level radiated by BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas, due to its redistribution between BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas.<br>
Consider in detail Fig. 6A, showing an example of the claimed<br>
method preferred embodiment, when BS transmit-receive antenna<br>
location, orientation of their antenna patterns, and their power of<br>
electromagnetic radiation are selected so that, on the one hand, maximum<br>
regular distribution of electromagnetic radiation power within a cell and<br>
minimal noise level for neighboring cells are provided, and, on the other<br>
hand, maximum regular distribution of mobile stations between coverage<br>
zones of different base station transmit-receive antennas is provided. This<br>
example of BS transmit-receive antennas location considers specific<br>
geographic conditions of the territory, where the radio interface of the<br>
cellular communication system is organized and the conditions of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas interaction with mobile stations. In addition,<br>
"dead zones" and areas of increased mobile station concentration across<br>
the cell square should be taken into account.<br>
There is one more important fact in favor of such BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna location within a cell. In urban environment, even<br>
radiation of nondirectional antennas is anisotropic by azimuth (see<br>
William C.Y. Lee Mobile Cellular Telecommunications, Analog and<br>
Digital Systems (Second edition) New York, 1995, NY10011). The whole<br>
cell square, including shadow areas, becomes covered by electromagnetic<br>
radiation power extremely irregularly and asymmetrically. Therefore, it is<br>
impossible to achieve regular electromagnetic radiation power coverage<br>
of the cell square by any of the proposed ordered set of BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas in real conditions.<br>
During organization of the cellular communication system radio<br>
interface the assigned area is analyzed, which is never geometrically<br>
proper in real conditions. Therefore, the cell borders will be arbitrary and<br>
will depend on the specific geographic and radio communication<br>
environment.<br>
For example, the assigned cell square is divided into eight service<br>
zones, where BS transmit-receive antennas AI - A8 providing regular<br>
distribution of electromagnetic radiation power across the cell square are<br>
located, BS transmit-receive antenna A9 is located in the area of increased<br>
mobile station concentration (denoted "1C"), and BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna Aj0 is in the "dead zone".<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas are placed in the following way:<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna Aj - in the center or near the cell<br>
center,<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas A2, A3 A4, A5, A6, A7 H A8 - near the<br>
cell border,<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna A9 - in the area of increased MS<br>
concentration "1C",<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna AIQ - in the "dead zone".<br>
By numbers in the rectangles the number of MS simultaneously<br>
served by the corresponding BS transmit-receive antennas is shown.<br>
The shadowed area located in the service zone of transmit-receive<br>
antenna A7 is an area of increased MS concentration "1C".<br>
The shadowed area located in the service zone of transmit-receive<br>
antenna A5 is a "dead zone".<br>
Dotted line connecting points Z and Z\t denotes the route of MS<br>
travel from the zone of serving some groups of transmit-receive antennas<br>
to the zone of serving other groups of BS transmit-receive antennas,<br>
where Z - initial point, Z\ - end point of MS travel route,<br>
On the left, there shown a diagram of MS service zones by BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas during MS travel from point Z to point Zi.<br>
The shown shadowed area, located in the service zone of transmitreceive<br>
antenna AIQ, is a "dead zone" generated, for example, due to the<br>
land lowering, i.e. ravine, or tall buildings of the type "closed rectangle",<br>
or other reasons. Therefore, an additional BS transmit-receive antenna A!0<br>
is located in the "dead zone" (for example, as shown on Fig. 6A). Then<br>
the orientation, power of electromagnetic radiation, and antenna pattern of<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna AIO are selected considering the summed<br>
radiation power of the neighboring antennas (Ai, A4 and A5).<br>
The shown shadowed area, located in the service zone of transmitreceive<br>
antenna A7, is an area of increased MS concentration "1C". This<br>
problem is connected with irregular MS concentration across the cell<br>
square, which can occur both occasionally and predictably during mobile<br>
station movement. To such areas of concentration belong, for example,<br>
public places, stadiums, exhibitions, trade fairs, shopping centers, railway<br>
stations, airports, busy motorways and so on. Beside the geographical<br>
position of these areas in a cell, the season-day activity of mobile stations<br>
in these areas can be predicted rather accurately<br>
High concentration of simultaneously operating MS on limited<br>
squares leads to BS overload in these cell zones. At the same time,<br>
optimal mode of resource use is achieved through regular load of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas.<br>
Each of BS transmit-receive antennas AI - A8has limited resources<br>
for quality service of simultaneously operating MS, for example, 35 MS.<br>
At some point of time, in each of the eight service zones there is,<br>
for example, the following number of MS denoted by the corresponding<br>
numbers:<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna AI - 35 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A2 -10 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A3 - 30 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A4 - 7 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A5 - 25 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A6 - 20 MS,<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A7 - 50 MS, including<br>
thirty MS located on the limited predictable square of increased<br>
concentration "1C",<br>
in the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A8 - 15 MS.<br>
A predictable situation has occurred, when BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna A7 can serve no more than thirty-five simultaneously operating<br>
MS. Therefore, in the zone of increased concentration "1C" BS transmitreceive<br>
antenna A9 should be placed in advance. In the current situation<br>
this BS transmit-receive antenna A9 will provide quality and prompt<br>
service of thirty simultaneously operating MS, located in the zone of<br>
increased concentration "1C".<br>
The electromagnetic radiation parameters of BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna A9 are selected so that it serves mobile stations within the area of<br>
increased concentration "1C" only.<br>
The algorithm of overload overcome is based on the automatical<br>
load redistribution between BS transmit-receive antenna A7 and BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna A9.<br>
The electromagnetic radiation power of BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna A9 is selected so that, in the mode of soft handoff during a mobile<br>
station travel to the zone "1C", the service of a mobile station would<br>
switch from BS transmit-receive antenna A7 to BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna A9.<br>
During radio interface organization in the cellular communication<br>
system the connection between mobile stations located on the cell<br>
territory, and base station serving the given cell should be conducted via<br>
those BS transmit-receive antennas, in the service zones of which the<br>
corresponding mobile stations are located; then, for example,<br>
orthogonality of signals radiated by different BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas should be provided.<br>
To provide orthogonality of signals radiated from different BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas is required for separate processing of one and<br>
the same signal arrived from different sources of electromagnetic<br>
radiation, radiating antennas and reflecting objects.<br>
The signal radiated from each BS transmit-receive antenna is a<br>
group signal. By the group signal we understand a sum of signals<br>
assigned for all mobile stations operating in the service zone of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas in the given point of time, i.e. for each MS its<br>
own signal is assigned, which is orthogonal to all the rest signals of the<br>
group signal.<br>
During reception of a mobile station signal the orthogonality of<br>
group signal identical components from different BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas can be provided through space diversity of BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas.<br>
On the other hand, since each BS transmit-receive antenna is served<br>
by a separate base station transceiver, synchronized in time with all the<br>
rest ones, the orthogonality of signals from different BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas can be provided through additional signal coding, by means of<br>
relative time and frequency diversity of groups signals, as well as by other<br>
means.<br>
The necessary condition for normal operation of modern cellular<br>
communication systems is provision of communication session continuity<br>
during MS travel from the one BS service zone to another BS service<br>
zone.<br>
The procedure of a user channel (traffic channel) switch from<br>
serving by one base station to another during mobile station movement is<br>
conventionally called handoff. There are varieties of handoff, such as, for<br>
example, "hard" handoff and "soft" handoff. "Hard" handoff is<br>
characteristic of the first generation of cellular communication systems<br>
and picocellular systems, in which MS receives information, first, from<br>
one BS, then, moving to another cell, switches to another BS serving the<br>
given cell, i.e. in the reception mode MS works with one BS only (see<br>
Y.A. Gromakov. "Standards and Systems of Cellular Radio<br>
Communication", ECO - TRENDS, Moscow, 1998, p. 68).<br>
Modern digital radio communication systems with channel code<br>
division are characterized by "soft" handoff, when a mobile station is able<br>
to conduct parallel reception of information signal simultaneously from<br>
more than one base station, for example, in accordance with standard IS-<br>
95, (see Standard of mobile and base station compatibility for two-mode<br>
cellular wideband systems with specter extension TIA/EIA/IS-95-A, May<br>
1995. Telecommunication Industry Association). The standard IS-95<br>
provides for the "soft" handoff procedure, both during MS movement<br>
from one cell to another, and during movement within a cell from one cell<br>
area to another.<br>
Consider an exemplary embodiment of the claimed method, when<br>
"soft" handoff is provided during a mobile station movement from the<br>
zone of serving some groups of BS transmit-receive antennas to the zone<br>
of serving other groups of BS transmit-receive antennas.<br>
On Fig. 6A by the dotted line connecting points Z and Z\, MS<br>
travel route from the zone of serving some groups of BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas to the zone of serving other groups of BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas, where Z - initial point, Z\ - end point of MS travel route. On the<br>
left, there shown a diagram of MS service zones by BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas during MS travel from point Z to point Zi.<br>
In the view of electromagnetic radiation power distribution from<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas within a cell, all MS in the cell are in equal<br>
conditions. However, depending on a specific MS location in a cell, the<br>
contribution to its summed input useful signal from different BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas is inequal in power.<br>
Assume that MS is at the initial point Z, in the service zone of one<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna A8. As MS moves along the cell territory<br>
towards the point Z\, it conducts connection with other BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas or groups of BS transmit-receive antennas, as shown on<br>
the diagram on Fig. 6A on the left. At the end point Z\t which is located in<br>
the service zone of BS transmit-receive antenna A6, MS can receive<br>
signals from BS transmit-receive antenna A6. In this case, it should be<br>
mentioned that, MS passing through the increased concentration area<br>
"1C", is served by transmit-receive antenna A9, located in this area.<br>
In other words, one or more out of Z BS transmit-receive antennas<br>
with the best conditions of signal propagation participate in a<br>
communication session with a specific MS, where L - total number of BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas in a cell. These transmit-receive antennas,<br>
participating in a communication session, change during MS travel. The<br>
change of a transmit-receive antenna is conducted based on the results of<br>
measuring MS levels of pilot signals, radiated by neighboring transmitreceive<br>
antennas, and analysis of the transmitted results of measurements<br>
at BS, or based on the results of analysis of signal levels received by<br>
neighboring BS transmit-receive antennas from the given MS. The<br>
decision about transmit-receive antenna change is made at BS. Thus, BS<br>
transmit-receive antennas in a cell are selected automatically and "soft"<br>
handoff is conducted within a cell.<br>
Soft handoff during MS travel from one cell to another is<br>
conducted similarly, though the decision about transmit-receive antenna<br>
change during MS movement from one cell to another is made by BS<br>
controller.<br>
Consider Fig. 6B, where vertical section of BS transmit-receive<br>
antenna electromagnetic radiation power distribution is shown, passing<br>
through BS transmit-receive antennas A7 - AI. Fig. 6B clarifies the<br>
principle of overcoming transmit-receive antenna A7 overload when<br>
switching transmit-receive antenna A9, serving the area of increased<br>
concentration "1C".<br>
Accepted denotations on Fig. 6B:<br>
curve a illustrates distribution of electromagnetic radiation power<br>
of BS transmit-receive antenna A7;<br>
curve b - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power of BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna AI,<br>
curve c - distribution of electromagnetic radiation power of BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna A4,<br>
curve d - .distribution of electromagnetic radiation power of BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna A9,<br>
Curves a, b, c, and d show how electromagnetic radiation power of<br>
BS transmit-receive antenna A9, serving the area "1C", exceeds the<br>
summed electromagnetic radiation power of BS transmit-receive antennas<br>
A7, AI, and A4 in this area. Therefore, as a result of soft handoff all MS<br>
located in the area "1C" will be served by BS transmit-receive antenna A9<br>
only. Thus, BS transmit-receive antenna A7 will be downloaded.<br>
Consider the structure of signal processing at BS, according to the<br>
claimed invention (Fig. 7).<br>
BS transmit-receive antennas li - 1L are placed considering<br>
specific environment (VCJIOBHH MCCTHOCTH), where a cell is located, but<br>
necessarily so that, on the one hand, maximum regular distribution of<br>
electromagnetic radiation power within a cell and minimal noise level for<br>
neighboring cells are provided, and, on the other hand, maximum regular<br>
distribution of mobile stations between coverage zones of different base<br>
station transmit-receive antennas is provided, considering "dead zones"<br>
and areas of increased MS concentration "1C".<br>
To make it clear how the claimed invention is implemented,<br>
exemplary embodiments of unit 3 (Fig. 7) and unit 8 (Fig. 8) are shown.<br>
At each BS transmit-receive antenna l! - 1L, a group signal is<br>
supplied, which is a sum of signals from mobile stations located in the<br>
service zone of the given BS transmit-receive antenna.<br>
The group signal at each base station transmit-receive antenna is<br>
formed by summing all signal paths of all mobile stations located in the<br>
service zone of this base station transmit-receive antenna in the given cell.<br>
I.e. electromagnetic field of each mobile station signal path induces its<br>
power in a base station transmit-receive antenna, and the summed power<br>
corresponds to the group signal which is a sum of signals from all mobile<br>
stations that arrived at the given base station transmit-receive antenna.<br>
The group signal of BS transmit-receive antennas li - 1L is<br>
supplied to the first inputs of signal diversity unit 2.<br>
Operation of signal diversity unit 2 can be organized in different<br>
ways. In the forward and reverse channels, unit 2 provides duplex device<br>
connection, for example, through frequency signal diversity. Unit 2 can<br>
act as a duplexer, since inputs and outputs of unit 2 are connected to the<br>
corresponding transmit-receive antennas, and base station transmitreceive<br>
antennas provide for signal reception and transmission, i.e.<br>
provide duplex communication.<br>
The output signals from unit 2 are supplied to the first inputs of MS<br>
signal path combining unit 3 and signal path search unit 8.<br>
Signal path search unit 8, scanning the uncertainty area by the time<br>
delay, detects a signal of each MS which can consist of several paths, in<br>
the group signals of each BS transmit-receive antenna lr 1L.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example, when MS signal path search unit 8<br>
conducts scanning of uncertainty area, for example, in parallel, i.e.<br>
simultaneously in K search channels \2\- 12k. In each channel search of<br>
signal paths of all MS, forming the input group signal, are searched.<br>
In signal path search unit 8, signal paths of specific mobile stations<br>
are isolated and their parameters - time delays - are estimated. Time<br>
delays of expected mobile station signals are estimated in signal path<br>
search unit 8, and time delays of signal paths during its schematic<br>
processing are specified in technical documentation.<br>
In signal path search unit 8, by the control signals from control<br>
processor 9, supplied to PRSG 14j - 14K, in search channels 12r 12k,<br>
signals are formed which assign the form and phase of PRS for all MS<br>
signal paths. The output signals from PRSG 14i - 14K arrive at the second<br>
inputs of correlators 13p 13k. At the first inputs of correlators 13r 13k<br>
MS group signal is supplied. In search channels 12r 12k) in correlators,<br>
correlations of MS input signal paths are calculated with the output<br>
signals of PRSG 14j - 14K, the results are compared in threshold<br>
comparison nodes 15i - 15K- Based on the comparison results, obtained in<br>
nodes 15i - \5^. of all search channels 12r 12k&gt; the decision about MS<br>
signal path detection.<br>
The output signals from MS signal path search unit 8 (Fig. 7) are<br>
supplied to the first inputs of control processor 9.<br>
Control processor 9 is made on microcomputer. It has a program, in<br>
accordance with which the algorithm of all mobile station signal path<br>
processing is performed. According to the program, control processor 9<br>
forms reference signals for all detected MS signal paths, considering the<br>
form and phase of PRS, and supplies them to MS signal path combining<br>
unit 3 at MS signal path combining nodes 10t - 10L via each transmitreceive<br>
antenna.<br>
In nodes \Q\ - 10L&gt; MS signal paths are combined via each BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna li - 1L&gt; considering the form and phase of MS<br>
signal paths. The detected mobile station signal paths are combined by the<br>
following algorithm. For example, / -th transmit-receive antenna receives<br>
one path of the first mobile station, two signal paths of &amp;-th mobile<br>
station, 4 paths - /-th mobile station. In z'-th node of mobile station signal<br>
path combining 10;, for each mobile station the signal paths of this mobile<br>
station are summed, considering time delays. At the output of node 10; a<br>
summed signal for each mobile station is formed, which is in our example<br>
a sum of signal paths:<br>
for the first mobile station - one signal path,<br>
for k-th mobile station - summed value of two signal paths,<br>
for /- th mobile station - summed value of four signal paths.<br>
Similarly, in each mobile station signal path combining node signal<br>
paths are combined for each mobile station (i.e. those signal paths are<br>
combined that are detected by unit 8 at the given transmit-receive<br>
antenna).<br>
The output signals from nodes 10i - 10L are supplied to the second<br>
inputs of channel estimation unit 4 and antenna signal combining node<br>
11. In unit 11 MS signal paths are combined via all BS transmit-receive<br>
antennas l j - 1L, forming a summed output signal which is supplied to<br>
receive signal processing and transmit signal forming unit 5.<br>
Unit 5 demodulates the input signal and transmits it to the user<br>
network.<br>
Signal from the user network, addressed to specific MS, arrives<br>
through the second inputs of unit 5 to unit 6, where signal for<br>
transmission in reverse channel is generated.<br>
Unit 4 estimates the signal paths of specific MS, isolated by control<br>
processor 9, and forms control command of signal transmission diversity,<br>
which is transmitted to the second inputs of signal transmission diversity<br>
control unit 7.<br>
Unit 7, in accordance with the received from unit 4 control<br>
command of signal transmission diversity, transforms the signal, supplied<br>
from modulator amplifier 6, according to the estimated characteristics of<br>
communication channel state, i.e. in unit 7 by the signal from control<br>
processor 9 the best channels of MS signal path propagation are selected<br>
and the level of transmitted signal is corrected for MS message<br>
transmission.<br>
The output signal from unit 7 for each MS arrives at unit 2 via<br>
selected channels of transmission to the corresponding BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas.<br>
Thus, application of the invention allows serving maximal number<br>
of simultaneously operating mobile stations with specified transmission<br>
and reception quality, i.e. providing maximal system capacity. This can be<br>
achieved through maximum regular distribution of electromagnetic<br>
radiation power within a cell, minimal noise level for neighboring cells,<br>
and maximum regular distribution of mobile stations between coverage<br>
zones of different base station transmit-receive antennas.<br>
Minimal noise level for neighboring cells is achieved through<br>
orientation of electromagnetic radiation inwards the cell for BS transmitreceive<br>
antennas, located near the cell border, and selection of BS<br>
transmit-receive antenna patterns, located in "dead zones" and zones of<br>
increased MS concentration "1C", as well as through electromagnetic<br>
radiation power redistribution between BS transmit-receive antennas,<br>
which allows reducing the total level of electromagnetic radiation power<br>
to the minimum acceptable. As a result of regular coverage by BS<br>
electromagnetic radiation power across the cell square, the required MS<br>
electromagnetic radiation power becomes reduced, which also assists in<br>
reducing mutual interference within a cell and improving the<br>
communication system capacity.<br>
Using the claimed base station in conjunction with the claimed<br>
method of cellular communication system radio interface organization<br>
allows increasing interference stability, and thus increasing the capacity<br>
of this communication system, which is achieved through signal search at<br>
the time uncertainty interval, receive channel quality estimation for each<br>
MS and selection of the best channels for transmitting messages for MS<br>
with the corresponding correction of the transmit signal level.<br>
