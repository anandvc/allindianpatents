MOBILE STATION, BASE STATION AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to radio<br>
communications, specifically to a mobile station, a base<br>
station, and a communications method which are usable in a<br>
packet switching mobile communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A conventional mobile communications system employs<br>
a line switching type communications method, where a<br>
dedicated channel is allocated to a user. Such a method is<br>
suitable for a system which focuses on an interactive service<br>
of voice, moving image, or the like (See Non-patent<br>
Publication 1, for example). However, since traffic will be<br>
transmitted in a bursty manner as IP packets due to<br>
implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) in a core<br>
network of future mobile communications systems, packet<br>
transmission is desirable also in radio transmission. In<br>
addition, when packet transmission is implemented in the<br>
radio transmission, delay in the radio transmission needs<br>
to be reduced, required transmission power needs to be<br>
reduced, and link capacity needs to be increased, for example.<br>
Moreover, error reduction in the radio transmission and<br>
highly reliable packet transmission are taken into<br>
consideration.<br>

SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
1<br><br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed toward provision of<br>
a mobile station, a base station, and a communications method<br>
that can increase uplink information transmission efficiency<br>
in a packet transmission-based mobile communications system.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>
used a mobile station that includes a multiplexing portion<br>
that multiplexes a contention-based channel and a<br>
non-contention-based channel, and a transmitting portion<br>
that transmits the multiplexed contention-based and<br>
non-contention-based channels to a base station. The<br>
contention-based channel is not required to be scheduled<br>
before transmission in the base station, whereas the<br>
non-contention-based channel is required to be scheduled<br>
before transmission in the base station. The<br>
contention-based channel includes one or more of a fast<br>
access channel, a reservation channel, and a synchronization<br>
channel. The non-contention-based channel includes one or<br>
more of an uplink shared data channel and an uplink shared<br>
control channel. The fast access channel includes traffic<br>
data, or control data having a data size smaller than a<br>
predetermined size, or a combination thereof. The<br>
reservation channel includes information to request<br>
scheduling the non-contention-based channel. The uplink<br>
data channel includes the traffic data, or the control data,<br>
or a combination thereof.<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, uplink information<br>
transmission efficiency can be increased in a packet<br>
transmission-based mobile communications system.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
contention-based channel and a non-contention-based channel<br>
are multiplexed and the multiplexed contention-based and<br>
non-contention-based channels are transmitted to a base<br>
station. While high speed communications are realized by the<br>
contention-based channel, appropriately scheduled<br>
communications are also realized by the non-contention-based<br>
channel.<br>
Multiplexing plural of the contention-based channels<br>
corresponding to plural users may include frequency<br>
multiplexing and a combination of the frequency multiplexing<br>
and code multiplexing. By using a wide frequency bandwidth,<br>
a frequency diversity effect can be obtained, thereby<br>
realizing high quality signal transmission with reduced<br>
transmission delay.<br>
An uplink frequency band may be divided into plural<br>
frequency blocks, each of which includes one or more carrier<br>
waves, and one or more frequency blocks may be used to transmit<br>
the contention-based channel and the non-contention-based<br>
channel.<br>
A synchronization channel may be less frequently<br>
transmitted than the fast access channel.<br>
The uplink shared control channel may include one or<br>
more pieces of control information associated with a<br>
scheduled uplink shared data channel, control information<br>
associated with a scheduled downlink shared data channel,<br>
control information for changing the uplink data channel<br>
scheduling, and control information for scheduling the<br>
6<br><br>
downlink shared data channel.<br>
The uplink shared data channel may be transmitted<br>
preferentially to a mobile station having a high quality<br>
transmission path (transmission channel) , which is different<br>
from the uplink control channel.<br>
A pilot channel, the uplink shared control channel,<br>
the uplink shared data channel, and another pilot channel<br>
are time-multiplexed and transmitted in a unit transmission<br>
time interval.<br>
The uplink shared control channel may be multiplexed<br>
by the frequency-multiplexing method, the code-multiplexing<br>
method, or a combination of the two methods, for two or more<br>
users.<br><br>
Examples according to the present invention will be<br>
described below. Specific values are used only for<br>
illustrative purpose; those specific values do not limit the<br>
present invention, unless otherwise noted; various values<br>
may be used to practice the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a transmitter according to a first example<br>
of the present invention. The transmitter is provided<br>
typically in a mobile station as described in this example.<br>
The transmitter includes modulating and coding portions 11,<br>
12, a multiplexing portion 13, a radio transmission portion<br>
(RF) 14, and a transmission time interval (TTI) control<br>
portion 15.<br>
The modulating and coding portions 11, 12 perform<br>
channel coding on data input to the portions 11, 12, and<br>
multilevel modulation on the coded data so as to output the<br>
modulated data. Channel coding rates and levels (modulation<br>
orders) of the multilevel modulation may be different<br>
depending on types of signals input to the portions 11, 12.<br>
7<br><br>
In the illustrated example, the contention-based channel and<br>
the non-contention-based channel are indicated as the input<br>
signals. Generally, the contention-based channel does not<br>
need to be scheduled by a base station before transmission,<br>
whereas the non-contention-based channel needs to be<br>
scheduled by the base station before transmission, as<br>
described in detail below. The non-contention-based<br>
channel may be referred to as a scheduled channel. The<br>
scheduling in this case means that the base station plans<br>
to allocate resources (frequencies, codes, or the like) to<br>
be used for signal transmission by the corresponding mobile<br>
stations.<br>
The multiplexing portion 13 multiplexes the coded and<br>
modulated data. A pilot channel may also be multiplexed<br>
depending on circumstances. The multiplexing may include<br>
time-multiplexing, frequency-multiplexing, or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
The radio transmission portion (RF) 14 processes the<br>
multiplexed data so as to transmit the data through an<br>
antenna.<br>
The transmission time interval control portion 15<br>
determines a transmission time interval (TTI) depending on<br>
necessity (or, for example, in accordance with notification<br>
from the base station) and notifies the modulating and coding<br>
portions 11, 12 or the like of the determined TTI.<br>
By the way, when code-spreading is employed, a<br>
spreading portion 113 is provided between the modulating and<br>
coding portion 11 and the multiplexing portion 13; and a<br>
spreading portion 112 is provided between the modulating and<br>
coding portion 12 and the multiplexing portion 13.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a receiver according to this example of<br>
the present invention. The receiver is provided typically<br>
in the base station as described in this example. The<br>
8<br><br>
receiver includes a radio transmission portion (RF) 21, a<br>
demultiplexing portion 22, demodulating and decoding<br>
portions 23, 24, and a transmission time interval control<br>
(TTI) portion 25.<br>
The radio frequency (RF) portion 21 processes a radio<br>
signal received from an antenna so as to convert the received<br>
signal into base-band data.<br>
The demultiplexing portion 22 demultiplexes the<br>
contention-based channel and the non-contention-base<br>
channel from the received signal. When the pilot signal is<br>
included in the received signal, the demultiplexing portion<br>
22 demultiplexes the pilot signal from the received signal.<br>
The demodulating and decoding portions 23, 24 perform<br>
a demodulating process, which corresponds to the multilevel<br>
modulation performed by the transmitter, and a decoding<br>
process, which corresponds to the channel-coding performed<br>
in the transmitter, on the contention-based channel and the<br>
non-contention-based channel.<br>
The transmission time interval control portion 25<br>
adjusts the transmission time interval (TTI) to be used in<br>
communications.<br>
By the way, when code-spreading is performed, a<br>
despreading portion 223 is provided between the<br>
demultiplexing portion 22 and the demodulating and coding<br>
portion 23, and a despreading portion 224 is provided between<br>
the demultiplexing portion 22 and the demodulating and coding<br>
portion 24.<br>
The contention-based channel and the<br>
non-contention-based channel to be transmitted from the<br>
mobile station undergo the channel-coding and the modulating<br>
processes, and are multiplexed and converted to a radio<br>
signal so as to be transmitted. In the base station, the<br>
radio signal is converted into the base-band signal, and<br>
9<br><br>
demultiplexed into the contention-based channel and the<br>
non-contention-based channel. As a result, each of the<br>
transmitted channels is obtained. The base station uses the<br>
pilot channel, which is transmitted when necessary, so as<br>
to perform channel compensation for the received signal, or<br>
the like.<br>
In this example, uplink signal transmission is carried<br>
out based on a single-carrier transmission method.<br>
Therefore, Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) can be<br>
relatively reduced in contrast to a multi-carrier<br>
transmission method. For the uplink signal transmission may<br>
be used Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) , Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (FDM) , Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) , or any<br>
combination of the three.<br>
The single-carrier-based radio transmission can be<br>
realized by various ways. For example, Direct Sequence Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) or Variable Spreading<br>
Chip Repetition Factors Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(VSCRF-CDMA) may be used. In the VSCRF-CDMA, the spreading<br>
portions to be provided at the places indicated by the<br>
reference numerals 112, 113 may be configured as shown in<br>
FIG. 3. In addition, the despreading portions to be provided<br>
at the places indicated by reference numerals 223, 224 may<br>
be configured as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of a spreading portion<br>
to be used in a VSCRF-CDMA-based transmitter. The spreading<br>
portion includes a code multiplying portion 1602, a<br>
repetitive combining portion 1604, and a phase-shift portion<br>
1606.<br>
The code multiplying portion 1602 multiplies a<br>
transmission signal by a spreading code. In FIG. 3, a<br>
multiplier 1612 multiplies the transmission signal by a<br>
channelization code determined under a predetermined code<br>
10<br><br>
spreading factor. In addition, a multiplier 1614 multiplies<br>
the transmission signal by a scrambling code. The code<br>
spreading factor SF may be determined in accordance with the<br>
communications environment.<br>
The repetitive combining portion 1604 compresses the<br>
spread transmission signal in a time direction and performs<br>
chip repetition a predetermined number of times (CRF times) .<br>
When the repetition number CFR is equal to one, the repetitive<br>
combining portion 1604 has the same configuration and<br>
operations as the usual Direct Sequence-CDMA (DS-CDMA)<br>
method. However, in the case of CRF=1, a phase shift in the<br>
phase shift portion 1606 is not necessary.<br>
The phase shift portion 1606 deviates (or shifts) a<br>
phase of the transmission signal by a predetermined frequency.<br>
The shifting amount is set specifically for each mobile<br>
station.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a despreading portion<br>
to be used in a VSCRF-CDMA-based receiver. The despread<br>
portion includes a phase shift portion 1702, a repetitive<br>
combining portion 1704, and a code despreading portion 1706.<br>
The phase shift portion 1702 multiplies a received<br>
signal by the shifting amount set specifically for each<br>
mobile station and demultiplexes the received signal into<br>
signals corresponding to the mobile stations.<br>
The repetitive combining portion 1704 extends<br>
(decompresses) the repeated data in the time direction so<br>
as to obtain the decompressed data.<br>
The code despreading portion 1706 performs despreading<br>
by multiplying the received signal by the spreading codes<br>
of each mobile station.<br>
FIG. 5 is an explanatory view for explaining primary<br>
operations in the VSCRF-CDMA method. For simplicity of<br>
explanation, a certain group of code-spread data sequences<br>
11<br><br>
is expressed by d1, d2,..., dQ, and a time period of each<br>
data element di (i=1, ..., Q) is expressed by Ts. One data<br>
element di may be associated with one symbol or any other<br>
appropriate information unit. This group of the signal<br>
sequences has a total time period of Ts x Q. The signal<br>
sequence 1802 corresponds to an input signal to the<br>
repetitive combining portion 1604. This signal sequence<br>
1802 is converted so that the signal sequence 1802 is<br>
compressed in the time direction by a factor of 1/CRF and<br>
the compressed signal is repeated over the time period of<br>
Ts x Q. The converted signal sequence is indicated by "1804"<br>
in FIG. 5 . FIG. 5 also shows a time period of a guard interval.<br>
The compression in the time direction can be performed, for<br>
example, by using a frequency that is CRF times higher than<br>
the clock frequency used for the input signal. With this,<br>
the time period of each data element di is compressed to Ts<br>
/CRF (but repeated CRF times) . The compressed and repeated<br>
signal sequence 1804 is output from the repetitive combining<br>
portion 1604, input to the phase shift portion 1606, shifted<br>
by a predetermined shifting amount, and then output from the<br>
phase shift portion 1606. The shifting amount is set for each<br>
mobile station, and set so that uplink signals corresponding<br>
to the mobile stations are orthogonal with each other in the<br>
frequency axis.<br>
A frequency spectrum of the uplink signal is generally<br>
shown by "1806" in FIG. 5, in which a bandwidth indicated<br>
by a spreading bandwidth could have been occupied by the<br>
spread signal sequence 1802 (the input signal at the<br>
repetitive combining portion 1604) if the spread signal<br>
sequence 1802 were transmitted without being compressed and<br>
repeated. A frequency spectrum of the compressed and<br>
repeated signal (the output signal of the repetitive<br>
combining portion 1604) has plural frequency components<br>
12<br><br>
arranged in a shape of comb. Such a spectrum is common to<br>
all the mobile stations. By shifting the spectra by a<br>
shifting amount specific to the corresponding mobile<br>
stations, the frequency components of the corresponding<br>
mobile stations can be orthogonal with one another. The<br>
compression in the time direction, the repetition, and the<br>
phase shift can spread the signals corresponding to the<br>
mobile stations discretely in a comb-like shape over the<br>
entire frequency band and arrange the comb-shaped frequency<br>
spectra on the frequency axis so as to be orthogonal with<br>
one another.<br>
The receiver performs the operations opposite to the<br>
transmitter. Namely, a user-specific phase is given to the<br>
received signal in the phase shift portion 1702 and then the<br>
signal is input to the repetitive combining portion 1704.<br>
The input signal is decompressed in the time direction, and<br>
the decompressed signal is converted to the spread signal<br>
sequence, which is in turn output from the repetitive<br>
combining portion 1704. The despreading portion 1706<br>
multiplies the input signal by a predetermined spreading code<br>
so as to despread the input signal.<br>
FIG. 6 shows examples of multiplexing the<br>
contention-based channels and the non-contention-based<br>
channels. In an example indicated by "TDM", these channels<br>
are time-multiplexed. While a minimum unit of the<br>
time-multiplexing is a time period corresponding to one TTI<br>
in the illustrated example, any other time period may be<br>
employed. In another example indicated by "FDM", the two<br>
channels are frequency-multiplexed. Frequency blocks shown<br>
in this example are called a chunk, a frequency chunk, or<br>
a resource block. Generally, one chunk may include one or<br>
more carriers, which may also be referred to as sub-carriers.<br>
However, since a single carrier method is employed in one<br>
13<br><br>
example of the present invention, one chunk includes only<br>
one carrier. In yet another example indicated by "TDM/FDM",<br>
the contention-based channels and the non-contention-base<br>
channels are multiplexed in both the time direction and the<br>
frequency direction. The frequency band used in a system is<br>
divided into plural frequency blocks, each one of which may<br>
be defined as a unit of resource allocation, packet<br>
retransmission, or the like. In these cases, multiplexing<br>
is appropriately performed every frequency block that is<br>
allowed to be used by the user. The transmitter shown in FIG.<br>
1 can perform various multiplexing methods including the<br>
three types of multiplexing shown in FIG. 6 by the<br>
multiplexing portion 13, the radio transmission portion 14<br>
and/or the spreading portions 112, 113. The receiver shown<br>
in FIG. 2 can appropriately demultiplex the multiplexed<br>
signal by the radio transmission portion 21, the<br>
demultiplexing portion 22 and/or the despreading portion 223,<br>
224.<br>
Various channels transmitted in uplink are described<br>
in the following. These channels are categorized mainly into<br>
(A) the contention-based channel, (B) the<br>
non-contention-based channel, and (C) the pilot channel.<br>
The contention-based channel does not need to be scheduled<br>
by a base station before transmitted, whereas the<br>
non-contention-based channel needs to be scheduled by the<br>
base station before transmitted. The contention-based<br>
channel includes one or more of (Al) a fast access channel,<br>
(A2) a reservation channel, and (A3) an uplink<br>
synchronization channel. The non-contention-based channel<br>
includes one or more of (Bl) an uplink shared data channel<br>
and (B2) an uplink shared control channel.<br>
(A) Contention-based channel<br>
The contention-based channel, which is transmitted<br>
14<br><br>
from the mobile station without being scheduled by the base<br>
station, can be transmitted by the mobile station at any time.<br>
The contention-based channel is desirably transmitted over<br>
a wide frequency band, which allows for a shorter<br>
transmission time. In addition, even if signal quality is<br>
degraded at a part of the frequency band, a frequency<br>
diversity effect is obtained due to such a wide frequency<br>
band, and power ramping or the like to compensate for the<br>
degradation of the signal quality is not necessary. While<br>
contention may be caused between the users, the<br>
contention-based channel can easily realize high speed<br>
communications. While the Time Division Multiple (TDM)<br>
method may be used, as is the case with the current UTRA,<br>
the Frequency Division Multiple (FDM) method and/or the Code<br>
Division Multiple (CDM) method are employed from the<br>
viewpoint of reducing contention with other users. However,<br>
once contention is caused between users, these users can<br>
retransmit the contention-based channel, if desired. The<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) method may be a<br>
localized FDMA method in which one continuous narrow band<br>
is allocated to one user, or a distributed FDMA method in<br>
which the spectrum is composed of frequency components<br>
arranged at predetermined intervals. The frequency<br>
components are usually regularly-spaced but may be<br>
irregularly-spaced. The distributed FDMA may be realized by<br>
the VSCRF-CDMA method, for example.<br>
(Al) Fast Access Channel<br>
The fast access channel may include a control message<br>
of small data size, traffic data of small data size, or both.<br>
One of the reasons of the small data size is to shorten a<br>
transmission delay. The control message may include, for<br>
example, information on layer-3 handover. The traffic data<br>
of small data size may include, for example, an e-mail having<br>
15<br><br>
a small volume of information, game commands, or the like.<br>
Since the fast access channel can be transmitted from the<br>
mobile station to the base station without any reservations,<br>
it only takes a short process time for the transmission. The<br>
fast access channel is transmitted by one or more frequency<br>
channels allocated in advance. The mobile station may be<br>
notified which frequency chunk among the plural frequency<br>
chunks should be used to transmit the fast access channel,<br>
through a downlink broadcast channel by the base station.<br>
The notification may be that a specific one frequency chunk<br>
among specific plural frequency chunks is to be used, or one<br>
or more frequency chunks among specific plural frequency<br>
chunks are to be used. Use of more than one frequency chunk<br>
is advantageous in that the rate of contention occurring<br>
between users can be lower than when using only one specific<br>
frequency chunk.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a mapping example of the fast access<br>
channel. In the illustrated example, Nf frequency chunks and<br>
Nt TTIs are allocated to the fast access channel.<br>
(A2) Reservation Channel<br>
The reservation channel includes information to<br>
request scheduling the non-contention-based channels. The<br>
information may include identification information to<br>
identify a mobile station, types of traffic data (voice,<br>
image, or the like), a data size, required quality<br>
information (QoS, or the like), transmission power of the<br>
mobile station, or the like. The reservation channel is<br>
transmitted also by the frequency chunk (or chunks) allocated<br>
in advance. The mobile station may be notified of which<br>
frequency chunk among the plural frequency chunks should be<br>
used to transmit the reservation channel, through the<br>
downlink broadcast channel by the base station. The<br>
reservation channel is preferably transmitted by a minimum<br>
16<br><br>
unit of resource allocation (one frequency chunk and one TTI)<br>
as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
(A3) Uplink Synchronization Channel<br>
In the example of the present invention, the uplink<br>
signal transmission is carried out by the single-carrier<br>
method, in which equalization is carried out in order to<br>
suppress multi-path interference. It is preferable to<br>
maintain synchronization so that reception timing of the<br>
received signals from various users falls within a<br>
predetermined guard interval, in order to carry our effective<br>
equalization. The uplink synchronization channel is used<br>
for synchronization. The mobile station transmits plural<br>
symbols including an active symbol portion and a guard<br>
interval portion in a predetermined transmission interval<br>
time (TTI). The base station removes the guard interval<br>
portion from a received signal from each mobile station and<br>
demodulates the content of the active symbol portion. The<br>
signals received in synchronization are demultiplexed into<br>
the signals corresponding to the mobile stations by an<br>
appropriate signal demultiplexing algorithm. The guard<br>
interval portion may be generated by any appropriate method<br>
such as a cyclic prefix (CP) method and a zero-padding method.<br>
The uplink synchronization channel is transmitted by one or<br>
more frequency chunks allocated in advance. However, since<br>
updating the synchronization timing is not necessarily<br>
performed every TTI, the uplink synchronization channel is<br>
transmitted relatively less frequently, as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
In addition, it does not take one TTI to transmit the uplink<br>
synchronization channel in many cases, although it depends<br>
on the data size of the synchronization channel.<br>
By the way, reception timing can also be synchronized<br>
using the pilot channel described below. Therefore, the<br>
synchronization channel and the pilot channel are not<br>
17<br><br>
necessarily always prepared.<br>
(B) Non-contention-based channel<br>
The non-contention-based channel is transmitted in<br>
accordance with scheduling performed by the base station.<br>
(Bl) Uplink Shared Data Channel<br>
The uplink shared data channel includes either one of<br>
traffic data and a control message of layer 3, or both. The<br>
control message may include information on handover,<br>
information necessary for retransmission, or the like. To<br>
the uplink shared data channel is allocated one or more<br>
frequency chunks in accordance with scheduling in the time<br>
domain, or in the time and the frequency domains. In this<br>
case, resource allocation is planned (scheduled) in the time<br>
domain, or in the time and the frequency domains, by the base<br>
station so that a user related to a better transmission path<br>
(channel) can preferentially transmit packets. The number<br>
of frequency chunks to be allocated is determined depending<br>
on a data rate, a data size, or the like of the packets which<br>
the mobile station is to transmit. When there are plural<br>
users that require a relatively low data rate, one chunk may<br>
be shared by the plural users. On the other hand, when a<br>
traffic size for a certain user exceeds a predetermined size,<br>
one chunkmay be used exclusively by the user, or plural chunks<br>
may be used by the user. When one chunk is shared by plural<br>
users, any kind of multiplexing is performed so that the<br>
channels of the plural users become orthogonal with one<br>
another in the chunk. For example, the localized FDMA or the<br>
distributed FDMA may be performed in the chunk.<br>
Generally, the TTI is a transmission unit of<br>
information. Any kind of control channel is given as<br>
overhead for every TTI. When the overhead is transmitted<br>
frequently, transmission efficiency of traffic data is<br>
inevitably reduced. In this example, the length of the TTI<br>
18<br><br>
may be adaptively changed. When the TTI is longer, the<br>
overhead is transmitted less frequently, thereby improving<br>
the transmission efficiency of the traffic data. Contrarily,<br>
when the TTI is shorter, significant throughput reduction<br>
can be avoided, which is preferable especially when the<br>
transmission environment is not favorable, for example.<br>
(B2) Uplink Shared Control Channel<br>
The uplink shared control channel transmits a physical<br>
control message and a layer 2 control message (FFS). The<br>
uplink shared data channel is scheduled by the base station<br>
so that a user related to a better transmission path (channel)<br>
can preferentially transmit packets. However, scheduling<br>
in accordance with channel conditions is not necessary for<br>
the uplink shared control channel. However, any kind of link<br>
adaptation (or adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)) may be<br>
performed for the uplink control channel, as described later.<br>
The base station performs scheduling so as to circumvent<br>
contention between the shared control channels and allocates<br>
the chunks and TTIs to each mobile station. Regarding the<br>
uplink shared control channel, the base station performs<br>
scheduling in accordance with the number of the users. In<br>
order to maintain a low packet error rate, highly precise<br>
control of transmission power is desirable. In addition,<br>
high quality received packets are desirable, which is<br>
realized by obtaining the frequency diversity effect through<br>
transmission of the uplink shared control channel over a wide<br>
frequency range.<br>
Specifically, the uplink shared control channel<br>
includes one or more pieces of (1) control information<br>
related to a scheduled uplink shared data channel, (2)<br>
control information related to a scheduled downlink shared<br>
data channel, (3) control information for changing contents<br>
of the scheduling of an uplink shared data channel, and (4)<br>
19<br><br>
control information for performing scheduling of a downlink<br>
shared data channel.<br>
(1) The control information related to the scheduled<br>
uplink shared data channel is transmitted associated with<br>
the uplink shared data channel only when the uplink shared<br>
data channel is transmitted. The control information, which<br>
is also called an associated control channel, includes<br>
information necessary for demodulation of the shared data<br>
channel (a demodulating method, a channel coding rate, or<br>
the like), a transmission block size, information on<br>
retransmission, or the like, and may be expressed by an<br>
information amount of 4 bits, for example. The<br>
retransmission control information may include, for example,<br>
information indicating whether a packet to be transmitted<br>
through the uplink shared data channel is a retransmission<br>
packet or a new packet, and information indicating a way of<br>
using the retransmission packet. For example, as a first way<br>
of using the retransmission packet, the data of the<br>
retransmission packet may be the same as the data of the packet<br>
that has already been transmitted (first transmission data) ,<br>
whereas the data of the retransmission packet is different<br>
from the data of the packet that has already been transmitted<br>
as a second way of using the retransmission packet. In the<br>
second way, the packet may be combined with redundancy<br>
information of error correction coding.<br>
(2)	The control information related to the scheduled<br>
downlink shared data channel is transmitted to the base<br>
station only when the downlink shared data channel is<br>
transmitted from the base station and received by the mobile<br>
station. The control information indicates whether a packet<br>
is appropriately received (ACK) or not (NACK) in downlink,<br>
and is expressed by one bit in the simplest case.<br>
(3)	The control information for changing contents of<br>
20<br><br>
the scheduling of the uplink shared data channel is<br>
transmitted in order to notify the base station of a buffer<br>
size and/or transmission power of the mobile station. This<br>
control information may be transmitted regularly or<br>
irregularly. For example, the control information may be<br>
transmitted when the buffer size and/or the transmission<br>
power are changed. The base station may change the contents<br>
of scheduling in order to keep pace with changing<br>
circumstances in the mobile station. The buffer size and the<br>
transmission power may be expressed by an information amount<br>
of 10 bits, for example.<br>
(4) The control information for performing scheduling<br>
of the downlink shared data channel is transmitted in order<br>
to notify the base station of channel quality information<br>
(also referred to as a channel quality indicator (CQI) ) . The<br>
CQI may be a received signal-to-interference power ratio<br>
(SIR) measured by the mobile station, for example. This<br>
information may be transmitted regularly or irregularly.<br>
For example, the information may be transmitted when the<br>
channel quality is changed. This control information may be<br>
expressed by an information amount of 5 bits, for example.<br>
(C) Pilot Channel<br>
The pilot channel can be transmitted from the mobile<br>
station through Time Division Multiple Access, Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access, Code Division Multiple Access, or<br>
a combination of the three. However, from the viewpoint of<br>
a reduced Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) , the TDM method<br>
is desirable. Since the pilot channel and the data channel<br>
become orthogonal by the TDM method, the receiver can<br>
accurately demultiplex the pilot channel, thereby<br>
contributing to highly accurate channel estimation.<br>
Specifically, this is advantageous when the highly accurate<br>
channel estimation is required, for example, per antenna in<br>
21<br><br>
a multi-antenna system such as a MIMO system.<br>
In this example of the present invention, channel<br>
estimation is performed distinctly for mobile stations that<br>
move at a high velocity and for mobile stations that does<br>
not move at a high velocity. To this end, there are prepared<br>
a first pilot channel for the mobile stations that do not<br>
move at a high velocity (in other words, the mobile stations<br>
in a normal communications environment) and a second pilot<br>
channel for the mobile stations moving at a high velocity<br>
of, for example, up to several hundreds km/h. A<br>
predetermined number of the first pilot channels are mapped<br>
for every TTI. Preferably, 2 first pilot channels are mapped<br>
in the front and the end of every TTI. The first pilot channel<br>
may be used for the channel estimation and the quality<br>
measurement of the received signal. In addition, the first<br>
pilot channel may be used to detect the synchronization<br>
timing. The second pilot channels are mapped at one or more<br>
places in the TTI depending on the velocity of the mobile<br>
station concerned and the transmission path (channel)<br>
conditions. No second pilot channel may be mapped depending<br>
on the velocity or the like. Namely, the second pilot channel<br>
is not always transmitted, which makes the second pilot<br>
channel a complimentary channel, whereas the first pilot<br>
channel is always transmitted. The number of the first<br>
and/or second pilot channels and the places where the mapped<br>
first and/or second pilot channels are mapped are arbitrarily<br>
determined from predetermined mapping candidates.<br>
FIG. 10 shows an example of mapping the pilot signals,<br>
where only the first pilot channels are included. In the<br>
illustrated example, eight (data) symbols are included in<br>
one TTI, and two first pilot channels are allocated to the<br>
top and the end symbols. In the figure, "CP" represents the<br>
guard interval according to the cyclic prefix. In addition,<br>
22<br><br>
"datai", "data2", ..., represent the contention-based<br>
channels or the non-contention-based channels.<br>
FIG. 11 shows another example of mapping, where two<br>
first pilot channels and one second pilot channel are<br>
included. As shown, the second pilot channel is allocated<br>
in the middle of the TTI (for example, at a fourth symbol) ,<br>
which is different from the example shown in FIG. 10. The<br>
first and the second pilot channels are used for the channel<br>
estimation, thereby estimating more accurately time-wise<br>
changes in the transmission path (channel) during the TTI.<br>
By the way, the transmission path (channel) is estimated more<br>
easily when the mobile station is not moving at a high velocity<br>
than when the mobile station is moving at a high velocity.<br>
Therefore, the information amount of the first pilot channel<br>
may be less than the information amount of the second pilot<br>
channel. This is depicted, for example, by symbol periods<br>
of time which are shorter for the first pilot channel than<br>
for the second pilot channel in FIG. 11. With this, the<br>
information transmission efficiency can be improved for the<br>
mobile stations that do not move at a high velocity.<br>
(Examples of channel mapping)<br>
FIG. 12 shows an example of mapping the uplink shared<br>
data channels, the uplink shared control channels, and the<br>
pilot channels (or an example of scheduling performed by the<br>
base station). In the illustrated example, the entire<br>
frequency band usable by a system of, for example, 20 MHz<br>
is divided into four frequency chunks (also referred to as<br>
system frequency blocks, in some cases) of 5 MHz. One chunk<br>
is shared by up to three users. One user can use one or more<br>
chunks. For example, a user A can use two chunks on the left.<br>
One transmission time interval (TTI) includes eight symbols.<br>
One chunk and one TTI constitute a minimum unit of resource<br>
allocation.<br>
23<br><br>
The uplink shared control channels are<br>
time-multiplexed with the uplink shared data channels per<br>
symbol in an allocated chunk. The pilot channels (the first<br>
pilot channels) are used commonly for the uplink shared<br>
control channel and the uplink shared data channel. These<br>
pilot channels are used for the CQI measurement and the<br>
channel estimation. These pilot channels are mapped at the<br>
top and the end symbols of the TTI. In the illustrated<br>
example, the complementary pilot channel (the second pilot<br>
channel) is not allocated, while this pilot channel may be<br>
allocated (or not) depending on the channel quality of each<br>
user. Plural shared control channels for plural users are<br>
multiplexed in the same symbol by CDMA and/or FDMA, which<br>
includes the localized FDMA and the distributed FDMA.<br>
According to this multiplexing, the frequency diversity<br>
effect is obtained.<br>
The pilot channels and the uplink shared control<br>
channels include information on the users whose data are<br>
multiplexed in the chunk to be used to transmit the channels,<br>
and mapped by FDMA or the like so that pieces of control<br>
information corresponding to the users are orthogonal with<br>
one another. A more specific example of mapping is described<br>
later.<br>
FIG. 13A shows examples of multiplexing the pilot<br>
channels and the uplink shared control channels included in<br>
the second TTI from the left in FIG. 12. In the illustrated<br>
example, the pilot channels are multiplexed by the<br>
distributed FDMA method so that signals from the<br>
corresponding users are orthogonal with one another, while<br>
the uplink shared control channels are multiplexed by the<br>
CDMA method so that signals from the corresponding users are<br>
orthogonal with one another. Or, the uplink shared control<br>
channel may be multiplexed by the distributed FDMA method<br>
24<br><br>
so that signals from the corresponding users are orthogonal<br>
with one another, while the pilot channels may be multiplexed<br>
by the CDMA method so that signals from the corresponding<br>
users are orthogonal with one another. Moreover, both the<br>
pilot channels and the uplink shared control channels may<br>
be multiplexed by the FDMA method or the CDMA method. In a<br>
mapping example 1, two chunks are used by the user A that<br>
can use the two chunks so as to code-multiplex and transmit<br>
the uplink shared control channel. This mapping example is<br>
advantageous when a transmission amount of data of the user<br>
A is large.<br>
In a mapping example 2, the user A that is allowed to<br>
use two chunks uses one chunk so as to code-multiplex the<br>
shared control channel and transmit the multiplexed channel.<br>
In this example 2, fairness is maintained between users.<br>
In a mapping example 3, the user A that is allowed to<br>
use two chunks uses two chunks at half transmission power<br>
per chunk so as to code-multiplex the shared control channel<br>
and transmit the multiplexed channel. In this example 3,<br>
fairness is also maintained between users.<br>
(Example of mapping procedure)<br>
As stated above, the plural uplink shared control<br>
channels for the plural users are multiplexed by the CDM<br>
method and/or the FDM method, and the channels related to<br>
the corresponding users may be orthogonal with one another.<br>
The base station provides the mobile station with information<br>
(mapping information) about the way the shared control<br>
channels for various users are multiplexed using the downlink<br>
shared control channel or the like. The mobile station<br>
transmits the uplink shared control channel in accordance<br>
with the provided information.<br>
By the way, orthoganality caused by the CDM method is<br>
more vulnerable than the orthogonality caused by the FDM<br>
25<br><br>
method, due to multi-path interference, a reception timing<br>
shift, or the like. Therefore, in one example of the present<br>
invention, the FDM method is employed when the number of users<br>
is less than or equal to a predetermined number Nf, and the<br>
CDM method is employed in addition to the FDM method when<br>
the number of users is more than the predetermined number<br>
Nf.<br>
FIG. 13B shows an example of a way where the uplink<br>
shared control channels for plural users are multiplexed by<br>
the localized FDMA method and the CDMA method. In the<br>
illustrated example, Nf is equal to 4 . As shown, the uplink<br>
shared control channels are multiplexed by the localized FDMA<br>
method when the number of the users is less than or equal<br>
to 4, and multiplexed by both the FDMA method and the CDMA<br>
method when the number of the users is more than or equal<br>
to 5. By the way, channels for a user 1 and a user 5 occupy<br>
the same frequency band and can be distinguished by any<br>
different codes CA, CB. Similarly, channels for a user 2 and<br>
a user 6 occupy the same frequency band and can be<br>
distinguished by some kind of codes. In this case, the codes<br>
to be used for the uplink shared control channels by the users<br>
1 through 4 may be the same or different. This is because<br>
the codes to be used in this case are used in order to<br>
distinguish channels that occupy the same frequency band and<br>
it is not necessary to distinguish the channels that occupy<br>
different frequency bands by the codes. In the illustrated<br>
example, the same codes CA are used by the users 1 through<br>
4 and the same codes CB (CB * CA) are used by the users 5 through<br>
8. When there are more users, other different codes Cc, CD, . .<br>
are used. The mapping information that is sent to the mobile<br>
station by the base station includes information indicating<br>
the frequency band, information designating the codes when<br>
the codes are used, or the like.<br>
26<br><br>
FIG. 13C shows an example of a way where the uplink<br>
shared control channels for plural users are multiplexed by<br>
the distributed FDMA and the CDMA methods. When the number<br>
of the users is less than or equal to 4, the uplink shared<br>
control channels are multiplexed by the distributed FDMA<br>
method. When the number of the users is more than or equal<br>
to 5, the uplink shared control channels are multiplexed by<br>
the FDMA and the CDMA methods. Similarily to the example<br>
shown in FIG. 13B, the channels for the user 1 and the user<br>
5 occupy the same frequency band and can be distinguished<br>
by any different codes CA, CB. Similarly, the channels for<br>
the user 2 and the user 6 occupy the same frequency band and<br>
can be distinguished by some kind of codes. The codes to be<br>
used for the uplink shared control channels by the users 1<br>
through 4 may be the same or different. In the illustrated<br>
example, the same codes CA are used by the users 1 through<br>
4 and the same codes CB (CB ≠ CA) are used by the users 5 through<br>
8 . When there are more users, other different codes Cc, CD, ...<br>
are used. The mapping information that is sent to the mobile<br>
station by the base station includes information indicating<br>
plural frequency components, information designating the<br>
codes when the codes are used, or the like.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 13C, since the frequency<br>
components of the uplink shared control channels for the<br>
corresponding users are distributed over the entire chunks,<br>
the frequency diversity effect can be more effective in the<br>
example of FIG. 13C than in the example of FIG. 13B.<br>
Therefore, the example of FIG. 13C is preferable from the<br>
viewpoint of improved signal quality.<br>
(Example of channel mapping in accordance with types of the<br>
shared control channel)<br>
As stated above, the uplink control channel includes<br>
one or more pieces of (1) control information related to a<br>
27<br><br>
scheduled uplink shared data channel, (2) control<br>
information related to a scheduled downlink shared data<br>
channel, (3) control information for changing contents of<br>
scheduling an uplink shared data channel, and (4) control<br>
information for performing scheduling a downlink shared data<br>
channel. Among these pieces of information, (1) control<br>
information related to the scheduled uplink shared data<br>
channel, which includes control information necessary for<br>
demodulation of the uplink shared data channel, is necessary<br>
control information that has to be associated with the uplink<br>
shared data channel. Contrarily, the control information<br>
related to the scheduled downlink shared data channel (2)<br>
and the control information for changing contents of the<br>
scheduling of the uplink shared data channel (3) are not<br>
necessary control information (or control information<br>
different from the necessary control information) and are<br>
not necessarily associated with the uplink shared data<br>
channel. According to such classification, the control<br>
information for changing contents of the scheduling of the<br>
uplink shared data channel (3) may be included in the<br>
necessary control information, or may be included in the<br>
control information different from the necessary control<br>
information.<br>
Therefore, regarding a combination of the channels to<br>
be transmitted in uplink, the following 3 transmission modes<br>
1, 2, and 3 are contemplated. Namely, there are the following<br>
three combinations of the channels included in one radio<br>
resource unit (uplink resource unit) determined by one<br>
frequency chunk and one transmission time interval (TTI).<br>
A mobile station that operates on the transmission mode<br>
1 transmits the pilot channel, the uplink shared data channel,<br>
and the shared control channel that includes only the<br>
necessary control information, and therefore does not<br>
28<br><br>
transmit the control information except for the necessary-<br>
control information.<br>
A mobile station that operates on the transmission mode<br>
2	transmits the pilot channel, the uplink shared data channel,<br>
and the shared control channel that includes all the control<br>
information including the necessary control information and<br>
the other control information.<br>
A mobile station that operates on the transmission mode<br>
3	transmits the pilot channel and the shared control channel<br>
that includes the other control information except for the<br>
necessary control information, but does not transmit the<br>
uplink shared data channel and the necessary control<br>
information. At any mode, the base station notifies the<br>
mobile station of an instruction signal and the mobile<br>
station transmits various channels in accordance with the<br>
instruction signal.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an example of channel mapping (part 1)<br>
in accordance with the types of the shared control channels.<br>
In the illustrated example, data of a user x that transmits<br>
the data according to the transmission mode 1 or 2 and data<br>
of a user y that transmits the data according to the<br>
transmission mode 3 are mapped so that one resource unit is<br>
shared by the user x and the user y. Since the pilot channel<br>
and the shared control channel of the users x, y are<br>
transmitted by the same time slot, the pilot channel and the<br>
shared control channel are frequency-multiplexed and/or<br>
code-multiplexed so as to be orthogonal with each other. The<br>
user x transmits the pilot channel, the shared control<br>
channel, the shared data channel, and the pilot channel, in<br>
the illustrated order. The user y transmits the pilot signal<br>
and the shared control channel, stands ready for a while,<br>
and then transmits the pilot channel again. Although each<br>
user is referred to as the "user x" or the "user y" for<br>
29<br><br>
simplicity of explanation, data of the user does not<br>
necessarily mean data of only one user but can include as<br>
much multiplexed data as possible if the data are allocated<br>
to one resource.<br>
FIG. 15 shows an example of channel mapping (part 2)<br>
in accordance with the types of the shared control channels.<br>
In the illustrated example, the user x that transmits data<br>
according to the transmission mode 1 or 2 and one or more<br>
users yl, y2, . . . that transmit data on the transmission mode<br>
3 use different radio resources to transmit the data. The<br>
user x uses a certain radio resource so as to transmit the<br>
pilot channel, the shared control channels (the necessary<br>
control information in the case of the transmission mode 1,<br>
and the necessary control information and the other control<br>
information in the case of the transmission mode 2), the<br>
shared data channel and the pilot channel in the order shown<br>
in FIG. 15. The one or more users yi, y2, ... transmit the<br>
corresponding pilot channels, the corresponding shared<br>
control channels (the other control information except for<br>
the necessary control information) and the pilot channels<br>
using other radio resources except of the certain radio<br>
resource used by the user x. In the other radio resources,<br>
the data of the one or more users are time-multiplexed,<br>
frequency-multiplexed, code-multiplexed, or multiplexed by<br>
any combination of the time-multiplexing, the<br>
frequency-multiplexing, and the code-multiplexing methods,<br>
so as to be orthogonal with each other. The radio resources<br>
that may transmit the control information except for the<br>
necessary information (the above-mentioned different radio<br>
resources) may be prepared periodically or non-periodically<br>
in the time direction and the frequency direction. Or, the<br>
period may be varied depending on transmission circumstances<br>
At any rate, the base station notifies each mobile station<br>
30<br><br>
of the instruction signal so that the control channels<br>
(except for the necessary control information) from various<br>
mobile stations are received in unison by a certain radio<br>
resource. The illustrated example is preferable in terms of<br>
reduced interference between the necessary control<br>
information and the other control information since the<br>
necessary control information is separated in the time<br>
direction from the other control information.<br>
FIG. 16 shows an example of channel mapping (part 3)<br>
in accordance with the types of the shared control channels.<br>
In the illustrated example, the user x that transmits the<br>
data according to the transmission mode 1 or 2 and the user<br>
y that transmits the data according to the transmission mode<br>
3 use different radio resources so as to transmit the data<br>
of their own. It should be noted that there is prepared an<br>
exclusive frequency band for the transmission mode 3 in the<br>
illustrated example. Since there is not much information<br>
quantity of the control information except for the necessary<br>
control information, the exclusive band may generally have<br>
a frequency bandwidth narrower than one chunk. In the<br>
illustrated example, since the radio resource that may<br>
transmit the other control information except for the<br>
necessary control information is prepared continuously in<br>
the time direction, the mobile station can readily transmit<br>
the other control information except for the necessary<br>
control information, if desired.<br>
FIG. 17 shows an example of channel mapping (part 4)<br>
in accordance with the types of the shared control channels.<br>
In the illustrated example, a part of the frequency band of<br>
a specific frequency chunk is used to transmit the other<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information. The part of the frequency band may be narrower<br>
than the bandwidth of one chunk, as is the case with the<br>
31<br><br>
exclusive frequency band explained in reference to FIG. 16.<br>
In addition, when the time slots that may transmit the other<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information are prepared continuously in the time direction,<br>
the mobile station can readily transmit the other control<br>
information except for the necessary control information in<br>
the example of FIG. 17. The part of the frequency band in<br>
FIG. 17 may be allocated continuously in the time direction,<br>
but may be allocated discontinuously. In addition, a<br>
position where the part of the frequency band is allocated<br>
in the frequency direction may be varied with time.<br>
FIG. 18 shows an example of channel mapping (part 5)<br>
in accordance with the types of the shared control channels.<br>
Specifically, FIG. 18 shows how data to be transmitted on<br>
the transmission mode 1 or 2 and data to be transmitted on<br>
the transmission mode 3 are transmitted. As shown, there is<br>
prepared an exclusive frequency band for the data to be<br>
transmitted on the transmission mode 3. In addition, a user<br>
that performs data transmission on the transmission mode 1<br>
transmits the necessary control information through the<br>
shared data channel and the shared control channel using any<br>
frequency chunk. On the other hand, a user that performs data<br>
transmission on the transmission mode 2 transmits the other<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information through the exclusive frequency band, while<br>
concurrently transmitting the necessary control information<br>
through the shared data channel and the shared control<br>
channel using any frequency chunk. A user that performs the<br>
data transmission on the transmission mode 3 transmits the<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information through the exclusive frequency band. With this,<br>
the base station can acquire the control information except<br>
for the necessary control information of all the users by<br>
32<br><br>
querying a received signal through the exclusive frequency<br>
band, which is relatively narrow, thereby facilitating<br>
signal processes in the base station.<br>
FIG. 19 shows a frequency band to be used in a certain<br>
communications system. The frequency band given to the<br>
system may include plural system frequency blocks, and a<br>
mobile terminal device can perform communications using one<br>
or more resource blocks included in the system frequency<br>
blocks, which is similar to the example of FIG. 12, although<br>
specific values are different. By the way, the frequency<br>
band may also be referred to as an entire frequency band or<br>
a system frequency band. In the example of FIG. 19,<br>
bandwidths of the system frequency band and the system<br>
frequency block are 10 MHz and 5 MHz, respectively, and thus<br>
the system frequency band includes two system frequency<br>
blocks. For simplicity of illustration, only one system<br>
frequency block is shown. The resource block has a bandwidth<br>
of 1.25 MHz and one system frequency block includes four<br>
resource blocks. The base station can determine whether one<br>
of the two system frequency blocks can be used for the mobile<br>
station in accordance with a bandwidth usable by the mobile<br>
station and the number of users communicating in the system.<br>
The bandwidth of the system frequency block may be designed<br>
so that all the mobile stations that should be allowed to<br>
communicate in the system can actually communicate within<br>
the bandwidth. In other words, the bandwidth of the system<br>
frequency block is determined as the maximum transmission<br>
band for the mobile terminal device having the lowest grade<br>
expected. Therefore, while either one of the system<br>
frequency blocks is allocated to the mobile terminal device<br>
that can perform communications only in a bandwidth of 5 MHz,<br>
both of the system frequency blocks may be allocated to the<br>
mobile terminal device that can perform communication only<br>
33<br><br>
in a bandwidth of 10 MHz. The mobile terminal device<br>
transmits the uplink pilot channel using one or more resource<br>
blocks included in the allocated system frequency block. The<br>
base station determines (schedules) in accordance with a<br>
reception level of the uplink pilot channel the one or more<br>
resource blocks to be used to transmit the shared data channel<br>
by the mobile terminal device. The content of the scheduling<br>
(scheduling information) is provided to the mobile terminal<br>
device through the downlink control channel or another<br>
channel. The mobile terminal device transmits the uplink<br>
shared data channel using the allocated resource blocks. In<br>
this case, the shared control channel (shared control channel<br>
including the necessary control information) associated with<br>
the uplink shared data channel is also transmitted by the<br>
same resource blocks. As stated above, the shared control<br>
channel may include the other control information except for<br>
the necessary control information. As explained in<br>
reference to FIGS. 14 through 18, the base station also<br>
determines the resource blocks to be used to transmit such<br>
control information to the base station by the mobile<br>
terminal device.<br>
FIG. 20 shows an example where resource blocks to be<br>
used by a user to transmit the shared control channel are<br>
changed with time. In FIG. 20, the uplink shared control<br>
channel of a particular user is transmitted by shadowed<br>
portions of the resource blocks. The resource blocks that<br>
can be used by the user conform to a frequency hopping pattern<br>
shown by the downward-sloping arrow in FIG. 20. The content<br>
of the hopping pattern may be known by the base station and<br>
the mobile station before starting the communications, or<br>
may be provided to the mobile station by the base station,<br>
when necessary. Since the frequency hopping is carried out,<br>
not only specific resource blocks but also various source<br>
34<br><br>
blocks are used. Therefore, signal quality of the uplink<br>
shared control channel can be maintained at an average level.<br>
By the way, the frequency hopping pattern shown in the drawing<br>
is merely an example, but various hopping patterns may be<br>
employed. In addition, not only one frequency hopping<br>
pattern but plural frequency hopping patterns may be prepared<br>
as candidates, and the patterns can be optionally switched.<br>
In the illustrated example, the user transmits the<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information except for a third sub-frame, which is a third<br>
one along the time direction. The sub-frame may be referred<br>
to as the transmission time interval (TTI) . In the third<br>
sub-frame, the uplink data channel is transmitted by the<br>
rightmost resource block, which also transmits the shared<br>
control channel. In the third sub-frame, a different<br>
resource block is used without conforming to the frequency<br>
hopping pattern. Information on such irregularity is<br>
provided through the shared control channel from the base<br>
station.<br>
FIG. 21 shows another example where resource blocks<br>
to be used by a user to transmit the shared control channel<br>
are changed with time. In the illustrated example, plural<br>
users that transmit the other control information except for<br>
the necessary control information use the same resource<br>
blocks and the same sub-frames, as explained in reference<br>
to FIG. 15. In this case, the useable resource blocks shown<br>
in the drawing may be varied in accordance with the frequency<br>
hopping patterns. In addition, even when one user transmits<br>
only the other control information except for the necessary<br>
control information at a certain point of time, if a radio<br>
resource of the uplink shared data channel is allocated<br>
afterward, the shared control channel is also transmitted<br>
through the resource block for the shared data channel. In<br>
35<br><br>
FIG. 22, the uplink shared data channel is transmitted by<br>
a second sub-frame and the third sub-frame, and the shared<br>
control channel is transmitted associated with the uplink<br>
shared data channel. This user transmits the shared control<br>
channel through the same resource blocks in other sub-frames<br>
as the resource blocks used by other users, which perform<br>
communications on the transmission mode 3, as is the case<br>
with the example shown in FIG. 21.<br><br>
FIG. 23 shows a schematic block diagram of a transmitter<br>
according to an example of the present invention. The<br>
illustrated transmitter is basically the same as the<br>
transmitter shown in FIG. 1, but different in that additional<br>
elements are provided due to a functional difference. The<br>
illustrated transmitter is generally provided in the mobile<br>
station. In FIG. 23, there are illustrated a pilot channel<br>
generation portion 231, a contention-based channel<br>
generation portion 232, a shared control channel generation<br>
portion 233, a shared data channel generation portion 234,<br>
a multiplexing portion 235, a discrete Fourier<br>
transformation portion 236, a mapping portion 237, and an<br>
inverse fast Fourier transformation portion 238.<br>
The pilot channel generation portion 231 generates a<br>
pilot channel to be used in uplink.<br>
The shared control channel generation portion 233<br>
generates a shared control channel that may include various<br>
pieces of control information. The shared control channel<br>
generation portion 233 is described later in reference to<br>
FIG. 25.<br>
The shared data channel generation portion 234<br>
generates a shared data channel to be transmitted in uplink.<br>
The multiplexing portion 235 multiplexes one or more<br>
36<br><br>
channels and outputs the multiplexed channels. As explained<br>
for Example 1, various kinds of channel mapping can be<br>
employed in uplink. Namely, all the channels shown in the<br>
drawing are not necessarily multiplexed, but one or more<br>
channels are multiplexed as circumstances demand. In the<br>
illustrated example, the multiplexing portion 235 performs<br>
the Time Division Multiplexing and the multiplexed signals<br>
are allocated to the frequency components by the mapping<br>
portion 237. The time multiplexed signals are categorized<br>
into the contention-based channel since scheduling is<br>
performed under instruction of the base station.<br>
On the other hand, the contention-based channel<br>
generation portion 232 generates a contention-based channel.<br>
Since the contention-based channel has already been<br>
explained, repetitive explanations are omitted.<br>
The contention-based channel and the<br>
non-contention-based channel are switched by a switch and<br>
either type of signal is transmitted.<br>
The discrete Fourier transformation portion (DFT) 236<br>
performs the Fourier transformation on the input signal (the<br>
multiplexed signal in the illustrated example). The<br>
discrete Fourier transformation is performed since the<br>
signal is a discrete digital signal at this stage of signal<br>
processing. With this, a series of signal sequences arranged<br>
along the time direction is expressed in the frequency<br>
domain.<br>
The mapping portion 237 maps the Fourier-transformed<br>
signal components on predetermined sub-carriers in the<br>
frequency domain. With this, the localized FDM or the<br>
distributed FDM can be performed.<br>
The inverse fast Fourier transformation portion 238<br>
performs the inverse fast Fourier transformation on the<br>
mapped signal components and outputs a series of signal<br>
37<br><br>
sequences arranged along the time direction.<br>
FIG. 24 shows a schematic block diagram of a receiver<br>
according to an example of the present invention. The<br>
illustrated receiver is basically the same as the receiver<br>
shown in FIG. 2, but different in that additional elements<br>
are provided due to a functional difference. The illustrated<br>
receiver is typically provided in the base station. In FIG.<br>
24, there are illustrated a discrete Fourier transformation<br>
portion (DFT) 241, a demapping portion 242, an inverse<br>
Fourier transformation portion 243, and a demultiplexing<br>
portion 244.<br>
The discrete Fourier transformation portion (DFT) 241<br>
performs the Fourier transformation on the input signal (a<br>
received signal in the illustrated example). With this, a<br>
series of signal sequences arranged along the time direction<br>
is expressed in the frequency domain.<br>
The demapping portion 242 extracts predetermined<br>
sub-carrier components from the Fourier-transformed signal.<br>
With this, the signals multiplexed, for example, by the<br>
localized FDM and the distributed FDM are demultiplexed.<br>
The inverse fast Fourier transformation portion 243<br>
performs the inverse fast Fourier transformation on the<br>
demultiplexed signal components and outputs a series of<br>
signal sequences arranged along the time direction.<br>
The demultiplexing portion 244 demultiplexes one or<br>
more channels and outputs the demultiplexed channels. In the<br>
illustrated example, the signals that are mapped into the<br>
frequency components are restored into the pre-mapped<br>
signals by the demapping portion 242, and the<br>
time-multiplexed signals are demultiplexed by the<br>
demultiplexing portion 244.<br>
One or more channels generated by the channel<br>
generation portions 231, 232, 233, 234 are time-multiplexed<br>
38<br><br>
by the multiplexing portion 235, (switched appropriately,)<br>
input to the DFT 236, and transformed into the frequency<br>
domain signals. The transformed signals are mapped<br>
appropriately on the frequency components by the mapping<br>
portion 237, input to the IFFT 238, and transformed to the<br>
time sequential signals. Subsequently, the signals are<br>
transmitted through an element corresponding to the RF<br>
portion 14 in FIG. 1. The signals are received by the<br>
transmitter shown in FIG. 2 or FIG. 24. The received signals<br>
are input to the DFT 241, transformed to the frequency domain<br>
signals . Since the transformed signals have once been mapped<br>
on the frequency components, the mapped signals are demapped<br>
to obtain the pre-mapped signals by the demapping portion<br>
242. The demapped signals are transformed to a time<br>
sequential signal by the IFFT 243, demultiplexed<br>
appropriately by the demultiplexing portion 244. The<br>
demultiplexed signals undergo a demodulation process or the<br>
like in processing elements (not shown).<br>
FIG. 25 shows a detailed view of the shared control<br>
channel generation portion 233. In FIG. 25, switches 251,<br>
252, 253, modulating and coding portions 255, 256, 257, 258,<br>
and a multiplexing portion 259 are illustrated. Each of the<br>
switches 251, 252, 253 allows the channel input to one<br>
terminal of the switch to go through to the other terminal<br>
of the switch, in accordance with an instruction signal (not<br>
shown) regarding the shared control channel. The content of<br>
the instruction signal is to determine how the shared control<br>
channel is configured, namely, what kind of control<br>
information should be included in the shared control channel.<br>
In the illustrated example, there are illustrated as the<br>
control information that may be included in the shared<br>
control channel (1) the necessary control information, (2)<br>
information indicating a successful reception or an<br>
39<br><br>
unsuccessful reception of a downlink channel - a positive<br>
acknowledgement (ACK) or a negative acknowledgement (NACK),<br>
(3)	information for changing the content of scheduling, and<br>
(4)	channel condition information (CQI) indicating a<br>
reception quality of the downlink pilot channel.<br>
Each of the modulating and coding portions 255, 256,<br>
257, 258 modulates the channel input to the modulating and<br>
coding portion by a selected modulating method and encodes<br>
the modulated channel by a selected coding method. The<br>
modulating method and the coding method may be different in<br>
each channel, or the same method may be used for two or more<br>
channels. The modulating method and the coding method may<br>
be unchangeably determined.<br>
The multiplexing portion 259 multiplexes the channels,<br>
generates the shared control channel, and outputs the<br>
generated shared control channel.<br>
In a conventional transmission through the shared<br>
control channel, the modulating method and the coding method<br>
are determined and fixed, and a required quality is intended<br>
to be obtained by controlling the transmission power.<br>
However, from the viewpoint of high quality channel,<br>
effective use of the resources, or the like, further link<br>
adaptation regarding the transmission of the shared control<br>
channel is preferably employed. As a method of link<br>
adaptation, Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) Scheme and<br>
Transmission Power Control (TPC) can be cited.<br>
FIG. 26 shows a principle of the AMC control that<br>
adaptively changes either one of a modulating method and a<br>
coding method, or both, in accordance with the channel<br>
quality, thereby realizing a required quality in the receiver.<br>
Specifically, when users (mobile stations) 1, 2 transmit at<br>
the same transmission power, the channel quality in the user<br>
1 which is located far away from the base station is expected<br>
40<br><br>
to be lower (or CQI is expected to be worse) . Therefore, the<br>
number of modulation level values (modulation orders) is set<br>
to be lower and/or a channel coding rate is set to be lower.<br>
In the illustrated example, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying<br>
(QPSK) is employed as the modulating method for the user 1<br>
and two-bit information per symbol is transmitted. On the<br>
other hand, the channel quality for the user 2 which is located<br>
near the base station is expected to be higher (or CQI is<br>
expected to be better). Therefore, the number of the<br>
modulation level values (modulation orders) is set to be<br>
higher and/or the channel coding rate is set to be higher.<br>
In the illustrated example, 16 Quadrature Amplitude<br>
Modulation (QAM) is used as the modulating method for the<br>
user 2 and four-bit information per one symbol is transmitted.<br>
With this, a required quality is realized by enhancing<br>
reliability for the user in a bad channel condition, thereby<br>
improving throughput while maintaining the required quality<br>
for the user in a good channel condition. When plural<br>
combinations of the modulating methods and the coding methods<br>
are prepared in advance, the number of transmission control<br>
bits can be saved by transmitting information indicating the<br>
combination to be employed (a Modulation and Coding Scheme<br>
(MCS) number) . FIG. 27 shows an example of such combinations.<br>
The MCS numbers may be the same as the numbers used for the<br>
shared data channels, or may be prepared separately from the<br>
MCS numbers for the shared control channels. Or, part of the<br>
numbers prepared for the shared data channels may be used<br>
as the MCS numbers. This is because the shared control<br>
channels do not require a fast transmission, while the shared<br>
data channels require the fast transmission. When received<br>
channels are demodulated in the AMC method, since information<br>
on the modulating method, the coding method, and the number<br>
of the symbols is required, any kind of measures have to be<br>
41<br><br>
taken in order to notify the receiver of the information.<br>
In addition, since the number of transmittable bits per one<br>
symbol is different depending on the channel quality, a large<br>
number of symbols are required when the channel quality is<br>
impaired, whereas data transmission can be performed at a<br>
small number of symbols when the channel quality is good.<br>
In contrast to the shared data channel, the MCS to be employed<br>
for the shared control channel may be determined in<br>
accordance with the number of control bits to be required<br>
for transmission. Namely, when a large number of control<br>
bits has to be transmitted, a large MCS number (a large number<br>
of modulation level values (modulation orders), a large<br>
channel coding rate) may be employed. In addition, when only<br>
a small number of control bits is required, a small MCS number<br>
(a small number of modulation level values (modulation<br>
orders), a small channel coding rate) may be employed.<br>
FIG. 2 8 shows an example of an uplink frame<br>
configuration. The shared control channel, the pilot<br>
channels, and the shared data channels are multiplexed by<br>
the time division multiplexing (TDM) method. The shared<br>
control channel mainly includes information to be used to<br>
demodulate the shared data channel, and may be referred to<br>
as a L1L2 signaling control channel. In situations indicated<br>
by (A), the uplink channel quality is good and a relatively<br>
large MCS number is used for the shared control channel.<br>
Therefore, the L1L2 signaling control channel occupies a<br>
relatively short period of time. In situations indicated by<br>
(B) , the uplink channel quality is good enough to such a degree<br>
that resource allocation can be scheduled, but is not good<br>
if compared with the situations (A) . In this case, a<br>
relatively small MCS number is used for the shared control<br>
channel. Therefore, the L1L2 signaling control channel<br>
occupies a relative long period of time. The MCS number may<br>
42<br><br>
be changed depending on not only the channel quality<br>
explained above but also the number of control bits to be<br>
transmitted. For example, when a Multiple Input Multiple<br>
Output (MIMO) method is employed, transmission contents may<br>
be different from antenna to antenna. Therefore, the number<br>
of the control bits may be different per mobile terminal;<br>
in addition the number of the control bits to be used for<br>
the shared control channel may be different depending on the<br>
number of antennas used, or the like. In this case, when the<br>
number of the control bits to be transmitted through the<br>
shared control channel is large, a large MCS number may be<br>
used (A) , whereas when the number is small, a small MCS number<br>
may be used (B).<br>
FIG. 29 shows a transmission power control method, in<br>
which a required quality is intended to be realized in a<br>
receiver by controlling transmission power. More<br>
specifically, since the channel quality is expected to be<br>
lower for the user 1 which is located far away from the base<br>
station, the downlink channel is transmitted at higher<br>
transmission power. On the other hand, the channel quality<br>
is expected to be higher for the user 2 which is located near<br>
the base station. In this case, if the user 2 transmits the<br>
uplink channel at higher transmission power even though the<br>
channel quality for the user 2 is better, other users suffer<br>
from strong interference from the user 2 . Since the channel<br>
quality is basically good, a required quality is realized<br>
even at low transmission power. Therefore, the uplink<br>
channel is transmitted at relatively low transmission power<br>
in this case. When the transmission power control is solely<br>
employed, the modulating method and the coding method are<br>
not changed and the combination known by the transmitter and<br>
the receiver is used. Therefore, it is not necessary under<br>
the transmission power control method to notify the mobile<br>
43<br><br>
station of the modulating method or the like in order to<br>
demodulate the channels.<br>
FIG. 30 is a flowchart illustrating an example of the<br>
transmission power controlling method. This method is<br>
generally called open-loop transmission power control.<br>
Here, the method is called "open-loop TPC" for simplicity.<br>
In this method, the base station transmits the downlink pilot<br>
channel to the mobile station. The mobile station receives<br>
the downlink pilot channel for a certain period of time and<br>
calculates an average path-loss or a propagation loss L. The<br>
propagation loss L is determined mainly by distance changes<br>
and shadowing, and in general is not very different between<br>
uplink and downlink, if averaged out for an appropriate<br>
period of time. For example, instantaneous fluctuations by<br>
fading are no longer influential when averaging out the<br>
reception quality for a relatively long period of time, which<br>
may correspond to, for example, one or more frames. The<br>
mobile station estimates the uplink transmission power by<br>
using the propagation loss L and transmits the shared control<br>
channel at the estimated transmission power. The<br>
propagation loss L is expressed by a difference between<br>
transmission power Pt at the base station and transmission<br>
power Pr at the mobile station. A broadcast channel<br>
broadcasted from the base station may include the<br>
transmission power Pt at the base station, uplink<br>
interference power I0, and a target quality SIRt.<br>
FIG. 31 is a flowchart illustrating another<br>
transmission power control method. This method is called<br>
"CQI-based TPC" for convenience sake. First, the mobile<br>
station transmits an uplink pilot channel to the base station<br>
and the base station measures the CQI in accordance with a<br>
reception level of the uplink pilot channel. The base<br>
station refers to a table as shown in FIG. 27 and determines<br>
44<br><br>
the MCS number to be used for the uplink data channel in<br>
accordance with the CQI. A corresponding relationship<br>
between the MCS number of the shared data channel and the<br>
transmission power to be applied to the shared control<br>
channel has been known by the base station and the mobile<br>
station. The determined contents (MCS number) are provided<br>
through the downlink shared control channel to the mobile<br>
station. Subsequently, the mobile station derives the<br>
transmission power corresponding to the shared control<br>
channel from the provided MCS number, and transmits the<br>
shared data channel and the shared control channel to the<br>
base station.<br>
FIG. 32 shows combinations of the control information<br>
and the transmission power control method. As stated above,<br>
the shared control channel may include the necessary control<br>
information and the control information except for the<br>
necessary control information. The necessary control<br>
information includes information indicating the MCS or the<br>
like to be used for the uplink shared data channel. The MCS<br>
or the like is provided from the base station to the mobile<br>
station in advance. As stated, the corresponding<br>
relationship between the transmission power of the shared<br>
control channel and the MCS number of the shared data channel<br>
can be set in advance. Therefore, since the mobile station<br>
can derive the transmission power of the uplink shared<br>
control channel from the provided MCS number, it is not<br>
necessary for the shared control channel to include the<br>
control bits for controlling the transmission power of the<br>
uplink shared control channel. Since the shared data channel<br>
cannot be demodulated if the necessary control information<br>
is not appropriately received, the shared control channel<br>
including the necessary control information has to be<br>
transmitted with high quality. Therefore, the CQI-based TPC,<br>
45<br><br>
which is more precise than the open-loop TPC, is desirably<br>
employed.<br>
On the other hand, quality of the control information<br>
except for the necessary control information is allowed to<br>
be less or equal to the quality of the necessary control<br>
information. Therefore, the CQI-based TPC or the open-loop<br>
TPC may be employed. However, when the CQI-based TPC is<br>
employed, information to be used to control the transmission<br>
power of the uplink shared control channel is required to<br>
be included in the downlink shared control channel.<br>
By the way, in normal AMC control performed on the<br>
shared data channel, the transmission power is maintained<br>
at a constant level and the communications are carried out<br>
by a certain combination (MCS) of the modulating method and<br>
the coding method, which are selected in accordance with the<br>
channel quality, in order to maintain the signal quality.<br>
In one example of the present invention, the AMC control is<br>
carried out also on the shared control channel. Although a<br>
high throughput is not required for the shared control<br>
channel, if compared with the shared data channel,<br>
application of the AMC control can improve the quality of<br>
the shared control channel by selecting an appropriate MCS<br>
in accordance with the channel quality.<br>
FIG. 33A shows operations for determining a<br>
transmission method of the uplink shared control channel<br>
(especially, the L1/L2 signaling channel) . As stated above,<br>
scheduling is performed on the shared data channel per TTI,<br>
and an appropriate MCS and/or transmission power are selected<br>
at a given time. The selected MCS is provided to the mobile<br>
station through the L1/L2 signaling channel. The<br>
relationship between the MCS and the transmission power has<br>
been known by the mobile station. Therefore, the mobile<br>
station performs the data modulation and the data coding on<br>
46<br><br>
the shared data channel in accordance with the provided MCS<br>
and thus transmission at the appropriate transmission power.<br>
The MCS and the transmission power to be used in L1/L2<br>
signaling may be determined and fixed. However, the MCS and<br>
the transmission power are desirably changed to some extent<br>
in accordance with the transmission circumstances, from the<br>
viewpoint of improved transmission quality. Taking account<br>
of this, the following operations may be employed.<br>
First, the mobile station transmits the pilot channel<br>
to the base station. Generally, the pilot channel is<br>
transmitted at regular intervals in uplink. When receiving<br>
the pilot channel, the base station measures the uplink<br>
channel quality and acquires the channel quality information<br>
(CQI).<br>
The base station determines radio parameters regarding<br>
the uplink shared control channel in accordance with the<br>
channel quality information (CQI) . The radio parameters may<br>
include pieces of information indicating a combination (MCS)<br>
of the modulating method and the channel coding rate,<br>
transmission period (TLiL2) of the uplink shared control<br>
channel, transmission power (PTx) , or the like. Such<br>
parameters may be stored in any memory device, for example,<br>
in the form of a table. The channel quality information (CQI),<br>
the modulation and coding rate information MCS, the<br>
transmission period TLiL2, and the transmission power PTX are<br>
related to one another, and at least from the channel quality<br>
information (CQI) are consequently derived other parameters .<br>
Generally, channel quality information CQI of a low quality<br>
channel is related to the MCS having a small number of<br>
transmission bits, a long transmission period TLIL2, and high<br>
transmission power PTX. Contrarily, channel quality<br>
information CQI of a high quality channel is associated with<br>
the MCS having a large number of transmission bits, a short<br>
47<br><br>
transmission period TLIL2, and low transmission power PTX. FIG.<br>
33B shows an example of a corresponding relationship between<br>
the radio parameters. In the illustrated example, the<br>
channel quality information (CQI) , the modulation and coding<br>
rate information MCS, the transmission period TLiL2, and the<br>
transmission power PTx are related to one another. In order<br>
to preferably maintain the frame configuration, the<br>
transmission period TLiL2 is only changed if the reception<br>
quality becomes highly detrimental to communications. Any<br>
number of combinations of the radio parameters may be<br>
prepared. However, it is not required to prepare as many<br>
combinations as possible in order to compensate for<br>
instantaneous fading. The number of the combinations may be<br>
limited when average fading or path-loss (distance changes,<br>
shadowing, or the like) can be compensated for.<br>
When the base station determines various radio<br>
parameters, the transmission method for the uplink shared<br>
control channel is determined. For example, the frame<br>
configuration shown in FIG. 28(A) is employed for a user<br>
having good channel quality, whereas the frame configuration<br>
shown in FIG. 28 (B) is employed for a user having bad channel<br>
quality. Information indicating the determined parameters<br>
is provided to the mobile station through the shared control<br>
channel. Information indicating the radio parameters is not<br>
required to individually express all the above parameters.<br>
For example, when the radio parameter table is shared by the<br>
base station and the mobile station, only the MCS is provided<br>
to the mobile station, and the mobile station derives other<br>
parameters from the MCS. Or, the CQI measured at the base<br>
station may be provided to the mobile station. At any rate,<br>
the mobile station has to appropriately know the radio<br>
parameters determined at the base station. In this example,<br>
the MCS determined from the reception quality CQI of the<br>
48<br><br>
uplink pilot channel is provided to the mobile station.<br>
The mobile station sets various radio parameters in<br>
accordance with the provided instruction. More<br>
specifically, the MCS is set at the shared control channel<br>
generation portion 233 of FIG. 23 (the adaptive modulating<br>
and coding portions 255 through 258 of FIG. 25) . The<br>
transmission period TLiL2 of the shared control channel is<br>
adjusted at the multiplexing portion 235 of FIG. 23. In<br>
addition, the transmission power is adjusted at the adaptive<br>
modulating and coding portions 255 through 258 and/or the<br>
multiplexing portion 259 of FIG. 25 so that only the signal<br>
of the adjusted power is output from the multiplexing portion<br>
259.<br>
Subsequently, the shared control channel is<br>
transmitted based on the appropriately adjusted radio<br>
parameters.<br>
By the way, in order that the base station appropriately<br>
receives the uplink shared control channel, the base station<br>
does not necessarily know the transmission power of the<br>
uplink shared control channel. This is because the higher<br>
the transmission power is, the higher the reception quality<br>
becomes. Namely, no information about a degree or change of<br>
the transmission power is transmitted in each case between<br>
the base station and the mobile station. On the other hand,<br>
if the transmission period TLiL2 and the MCS of the shared<br>
control channel are unknown, no appropriate reception is<br>
possible. Therefore, the information indicating the radio<br>
parameters such as the MCS or the like has to be communicated<br>
between the base station and the mobile station though any<br>
signaling channel every time the information is changed. Or,<br>
it is required to perform blind detection in which<br>
demodulation is carried out in the receiver using all the<br>
combinations so as to confirm the appropriate reception using<br>
49<br><br>
error detection decoding or the like. Frequent use of the<br>
signaling channels may lead to increased consumption of the<br>
radio resources as well as complicated signal processing.<br>
Therefore, the MCS or the like of the shared control channel<br>
per se shown in FIG. 33A is adjusted in relatively long periods,<br>
and may be transmitted as an L3 signaling channel. On the<br>
other hand, the transmission power of the shared data channel<br>
and the shared control channel is updated in relatively short<br>
periods by the CQI-based TPC shown in FIG. 31.<br>
In the manner mentioned above, the high quality shared<br>
control channel is realized by appropriately adjusting one<br>
or more of the modulating and coding methods MCS of the uplink<br>
shared control channel, the transmission period TLiL2, and the<br>
transmission power PTX.<br><br>
The mobile station and the base station may communicate<br>
with each other using a single antenna or plural antennas,<br>
or may constitute a multi-antenna system, especially, a Multi<br>
Input Multi Output (MIMO)-based system. In this case, the<br>
uplink shared control channel may be transmitted from a<br>
single antenna or plural antennas. In the former case, one<br>
of the plural antennas provided in the mobile station is used<br>
to transmit the shared control channel. As a MIMO-based<br>
transmission method, there are a MIMO multiplexing method<br>
and a MIMO diversity method. In the MIMO multiplexing method,<br>
different signals are transmitted on the same frequency in<br>
the same period of time from each antenna, which is preferable<br>
in terms of high throughput. However, when the shared data<br>
channel is not transmitted, or when the shared data channel<br>
is transmitted by the MIMO diversity method, it is not<br>
preferable or practical to transmit the shared control<br>
channel by the MIMO multiplexing method. Therefore, the<br>
50<br><br>
shared control channel is transmitted by the MIMO<br>
multiplexing method only when the shared data channel to be<br>
associated with the shared control channel is transmitted<br>
by the MIMO multiplexing method. By the way, while the shared<br>
data channel is transmitted fast by the MIMO multiplexing<br>
method, the shared control channel to be associated with the<br>
shared control channel may be transmitted by the MIMO<br>
diversity method.<br>
There are several kinds of the MIMO diversity methods<br>
such as a Time Switched Transmit Diversity (TSTD) method,<br>
a Delay Diversity method, and Spaced Time Block Coding (STBC)<br>
method or the like. In the TSTD method, a signal is<br>
instantaneously transmitted from one antenna, and the<br>
antennas for transmitting the signal are changed with time.<br>
In the delay diversity method, transmission timing of a<br>
signal is purposefully changed in each antenna, and various<br>
delay paths are combined in a receiver. In the STBC method,<br>
a certain set of plural symbols is converted into another<br>
set of symbols by changing the symbol order, changing<br>
polarities, and/or converting into a complex conjugate<br>
number. At any rate, while the MIMO diversity method<br>
provides substantially the same throughput as the single<br>
antenna method, the MIMO diversity method can improve<br>
reliability of the data transmission. On the other hand, the<br>
MIMO multiplexing method can provide high throughput. Among<br>
the MIMO diversity methods, the TSTD method is advantageous<br>
in that a large total amount of information to be transmitted<br>
and high process workload in the receiver are not required,<br>
compared with the other methods.<br>
When the MIMO-based system is composed of the base<br>
station and the mobile station, the mobile station is<br>
required to transmit feedback signals to each transmission<br>
antenna of the base station. For example, the feedback<br>
51<br><br>
signals may include information indicating a successful<br>
reception (ACK) or an unsuccessful reception (NACK) of the<br>
downlink channel, the channel quality information (CQI) or<br>
the like. These pieces of information are the same as the<br>
control information except for the necessary control<br>
information, as stated above. The base station inquires the<br>
downlink channel quality per antenna in accordance with the<br>
feedback signals transmitted back to corresponding antennas .<br>
In this case, the plural feedback signals prepared per<br>
transmission antenna of the base station may be transmitted<br>
within one sub-frame or unit transmission time interval (see<br>
FIG. 34(A)). With this, the control delay can be reduced<br>
regardless of the number of the transmission antennas.<br>
However, the number of control bits necessary per sub-frame<br>
is increased, as the number of the antennas is increased.<br>
Or, the feedback signal for one antenna may be transmitted<br>
in one sub-frame (see FIG. 34 (B) ) . With this, the number of<br>
the control bits necessary per sub-frame is maintained<br>
constant, thereby maintaining a transmission frame<br>
configuration regardless of the number of the transmission<br>
antennas. However, since the control delay may be increased,<br>
the number of the feedback signals per transmission antenna<br>
is preferably reduced. For example, when the number of the<br>
antennas is 2, it is preferable that the feedback signal be<br>
transmitted once in one sub-frame in the case of the technique<br>
(A), whereas it is preferable that the feedback signal be<br>
transmitted 0.5 times in one sub-frame in the case of the<br>
technique (B).<br>
Although the present invention has been described<br>
referring to several individual examples for simplicity of<br>
explanations, practicing each of these individual examples<br>
is not essential to the present invention, but one or more<br>
examples in combination may be implemented in accordance with<br>
52<br><br>
demands.<br>
