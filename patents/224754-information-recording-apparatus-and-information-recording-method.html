				<td>The present invention relates to a technical field of an information<br>
recording method and an information recording apparatus. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to a technical field of an information<br>
recording method and an information recording apparatus, which<br>
record both of recording information to be recorded and reproduction<br>
controlling information for controlling a reproduction manner upon<br>
reproducing the foregoing recording information after recording in one<br>
information recording medium.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, research and development regarding a DVD, which is an<br>
optical disk having severalfold recording capacity than that of a<br>
conventional CD (Compact Disk), has been done extensively.<br>
A reproduction-only DVD in which a movie or the like is recorded<br>
is popular. However, in addition to this, a standard of a DVD in which<br>
video information such as moving image information and voice<br>
information or the like are capable of being recorded (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as video DVD), and a standard of a DVD in which audio<br>
information including music information and voice information or the<br>
like are capable of being recorded (hereinafter, referred to as audio<br>
DVD), are being plotted out as a standard of a DVD capable of<br>
recording.<br>
In a video DVD standard of which plotting out has been nearly<br>
completed, video information which is recorded from start of recording<br>
to end thereof by a user (i.e., video information in a range capable of<br>
being identified by the user as one group) is recorded as one group in a<br>
DVD. In this case, upon recording the video information, reproduction<br>
controlling information for controlling a reproduction manner of the<br>
video information, which includes a reproduction order, a reproduction<br>
time or the like, is also generated simultaneously and it is standardized<br>
that the generated reproduction controlling information is recorded in<br>
the DVD together with the video information. The reproduction<br>
controlling information is also referred to as navigation information in<br>
the video DVD standard.<br>
On the other hand, in the case that a group of the video<br>
information which is recorded once (hereinafter, referred to the group of<br>
the video information as source video information) is video information<br>
capable of being obtained by receiving, for example, television broadcast<br>
or the like, a portion of the video information, specifically, for example,<br>
a commercial message part, may be required to be deleted after<br>
completion of recording the source video information.<br>
In such a case, a video DVD recorder on sale which employs the<br>
standard of the video DVD is configured in such a manner that this<br>
video DVD recorder deletes a portion of the source video information in<br>
accordance with an instruction from the user, divides source video<br>
information and edits the reproduction controlling information<br>
(hereinafter, referred to the reproduction controlling information as<br>
source video reproduction controlling information) in response to the<br>
source video information so as to reproduce the divided source video<br>
information as one group, namely, to reproduce it as what is called one<br>
program.<br>
On the other hand, an audio DVD recorder employing the audio<br>
DVD standard, whose standardization is in progress, is also expected to<br>
be sold. However, in the case that one group of the audio information,<br>
which is recorded after recording (hereinafter, referred to the group of<br>
the audio information as source audio information), is divided by<br>
deleting a portion thereof in this audio DVD recorder or the like, if the<br>
dividing concept with respect to the above source video information is<br>
intended to be employed as it is, it can be considered to edit the<br>
reproduction controlling information in response to the source audio<br>
information (hereinafter, referred to the reproduction controlling<br>
information as source audio reproduction controlling information) so as<br>
to reproduce all of the audio information after dividing as one group.<br>
However, especially, for the audio information, there is a case that<br>
applying a concept for dividing the above described video information is<br>
inappropriate.<br>
In other words, for example, in the case that the source audio<br>
information is obtained by copying a plurality of music pieces recorded<br>
in one piece of CD as they are, one group of the plural songs is recorded<br>
as the source audio information. Further, the corresponding source<br>
audio reproduction controlling information is also recorded so as to<br>
control reproduction of the plural songs as one group.<br>
In this case, in order to edit new reproduction controlling<br>
information so as to extract and reproduce only a part of the plural<br>
songs, it is necessary to designate a recording position of a song to be<br>
reproduced from a head of the source audio information.<br>
Simultaneously, also in the case of searching the recording position, at<br>
first, it is necessary to start reproduction from a head of the source<br>
audio information. As a result, this involves a problem such that an<br>
unnecessary time is required to search the song and convenience is<br>
extremely lowered upon editing new reproduction controlling<br>
information.<br>
The present invention has been made taking the foregoing<br>
problem into consideration, an object of the invention is to provide an<br>
information recording method and an information recording apparatus,<br>
which are capable of recording reproduction controlling information or<br>
the like in such a manner that it is possible to improve convenience<br>
upon controlling a reproduction manner of recording information.<br>
The above object of the present invention can be achieved by an<br>
information recording apparatus for recording information to be<br>
recorded in an information recording medium and generating<br>

(II) with respect to audio DVD standard.<br>
Before explaining embodiments according to the present invention, at first, the standard<br>
of the audio DVD to which the present embodiment is employed will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram for showing a physical format in a DVD after the audio information<br>
is recorded on the basis of the standard of the audio DVD (i.e., specifically, a physical<br>
format for showing a recording positions or the like in the DVD of the respective<br>
information). FIG. 2 is a diagram for showing a logical recording format generated so<br>
as to control the reproduction manner of the audio information recorded in the DVD<br>
(i.e., specifically, connection of the respective information upon reproduction and the<br>
recording positions on the DVD of respective information to be connected).<br>
At first, the physical format in the audio DVD standard will be described with reference<br>
to FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, DVD 1 is a DVD capable of recording such as a DVD-R<br>
(DVD-Recordable) which can be rewritten only once or a DVD-RW (DVD-Rewritable)<br>
which can be rewritten in plural times.<br>
As shown in FIO. 1, according to the standard of the audio DVD<br>
a lead-in area LI, a data area DA and a lead-out area LO are formed<br>
from its inner radius in the DVD 1. In the lead-in-area LI, starting<br>
information or the like, which is controlling information to start<br>
reproduction of the information in the DVD is recorded. In the data<br>
area DA, reproduction controlling information to control the audio<br>
information to be reproduced in practice and the reproduction manner<br>
of the audio information is recorded. The reproduction controlling<br>
information is specifically reproductiqn controlling information showing<br>
reproduction order of respective information constructing the audio<br>
information and reproduction time or recording positions on the DVD or<br>
the like. In the lead-out-area LO, termination information or the like,<br>
which is controlling information to terminate reproduction of the audio<br>
information is recorded.<br>
Next, a file system information area FSA, a navigation information<br>
area NA and an object recording area ORA are formed in the above data<br>
area DA.<br>
Among the above areas, in the object recording area ORA a,<br>
plurality of audio objects (AOB) which are the audio information<br>
be recorded are recorded. In this case, a series of audio information<br>
which is recorded during a period from recording is commenced once<br>
until it is terminated, corresponding to an audio object use after the<br>
recording is terminated. In other words audio objects are formed in<br>
the object recording area ORA one by one every time a series of the<br>
audio information is completely recorded.<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 1 shows a state that n pieces of audio objects<br>
are recorded as a first object OBJ1 to OBJn with being numbered,<br>
respectively.<br>
Additionally, in a logical format to be described later, a series of<br>
audio objects which are recorded in the DVD 1 during a period from<br>
recording is commenced once until it is terminated, is referred to as a<br>
track.<br>
Next, one audio object is comprised of a plurality of audio object<br>
units AOBU. In this case, the audio object unit AOBU is recorded by<br>
segmenting the audio object for every period of time (for example, for<br>
every second) upon recording.<br>
Alternatively, upon recording of the audio information, this audio<br>
object unit AOBU becomes the minimum unit for edition or deletion of<br>
the audio object.<br>
On the other hand, in the navigation information area NA in the<br>
data area DA, the reproduction controlling information is recorded as<br>
the navigation information to control the reproduction manner of the<br>
audio information recorded in the object recording area ORAS to be<br>
described later.<br>
Further, in the file system information area FSA system<br>
information is recorded to store the above navigation information by<br>
hierarchical structure in filling format in the navigation information<br>
area NA.<br>
Next, as the navigation information in the navigation information<br>
area NA, navigation total information NT, an object file information table<br>
OFT, object recording sequence information OSI, setting reproduction<br>
sequence information UDI and other navigation information ET are<br>
recorded.<br>
Among the above information, the navigation total information NT<br>
is comprised of navigation information managing information NM,<br>
which is also called General Information (GI), and a reproduction list<br>
pointer table PLT. The navigation information managing information<br>
NM is total information of the DVD 1 for managing a storing position<br>
(recording position) in respective sequences in the . navigation<br>
information area NA or in the navigation information area NA of the<br>
information table, and a recording starting position of the object<br>
recording area ORA or the like. The reproduction list pointer table PLT<br>
indicates a corresponding relation between the navigation information<br>
stored in the setting reproduction sequence information UDI and a<br>
reproduction list (referred to as play list (PL) in the audio DVD standard)<br>
to be described later.<br>
Next, the object file information table OFT is comprised of object<br>
file attribution information OFZ and object file information OFI. The<br>
object file attribution information OFZ comprises variety of object to be<br>
recorded in the object recording area ORA and the attribution<br>
information related to this variety or the like. The varity of object<br>
indicates that objects to be recorded in the object recording area ORA is<br>
an audio object in the case of the present embodiment. The object file<br>
information OFI comprises a reproduction start time and a reproduction<br>
termination time of respective: objects (audio object); which are the ones<br>
in which a head of the first object OBJ1 is defined as a start point and the information related to them, or the like.<br>
Further, in the object file information OFI, various information<br>
related to one or a plurality of the above audio objects recorded on the<br>
DVD 1 is recorded. Specifically, the various information is comprised<br>
of object file total information OFO, L pieces of object search pointers<br>
OBS (L is the number of the audio objects, which are recorded in the<br>
DVD 1) and L pieces of object information OBS (namely, as many as the<br>
object search pointer OBS). The object file total information OFG<br>
includes total number or the like on the DVD 1 of the audio object at<br>
the moment. The address information of heads of respective audio<br>
objects to be searched (reproduced) in the reproduction processing or<br>
the like to be described later, are described in the object search pointers<br>
OBS. The address information or the like indicating a recording<br>
position on the DVD 1 of heads of respective audio objects are described<br>
in the reproduction processing or the like in the object information<br>
OBS.<br>
Furthermore, respective object information OBS are comprised of<br>
object general information OI and object unit information UI. The<br>
object general information OI comprises a reproduction start time and a<br>
reproduction termination time of respective objects and the information<br>
related to them. The object unit information UI comprises information<br>
such as a reproduction time of the audio object unit AOBU constructing<br>
respective audio objects, a recording start address or a size there often<br>
the like<br>
Next, the object recording sequences OSI is referred as an<br>
original program chain ORG-PGC in the audio DVD standard. The<br>
object recording sequence OSI is information indicating a recording<br>
sequence of respective audio objects. Namely, it indicates in what<br>
order, what audio information is recorded in the DVD 1 as the audio<br>
object in the beginning of recording.<br>
Additionally, the above described object file information,table OFT<br>
and the object recording sequence OSI are newly, generated, updated<br>
and recorded every time a new audio object is recorded in the DVD 1.<br>
Due to these information, a user is capable of reproducing them by the<br>
order and the reproduction time as same as those in the case that<br>
respective audio objects are recorded.<br>
On the other hand, the setting reproduction sequence information<br>
UDI is referred to as a user defined program chain (UD-PGC) in the<br>
audio DVD standard. The user generates one or plural setting<br>
reproduction sequence information UDI in order to reproduce logically<br>
all or a part of the recorded audio objects in a mutual, free and original<br>
combination. The setting reproduction sequence information UDI are<br>
recorded with being numbered every time the user newly sets them. In<br>
this case, the user defined program chain is associated with the reproduction list described above.<br>
Further, other navigation information ET is comprised of the<br>
information necessary for controlling reproduction in addition of the<br>
above described respective navigation information.<br>
Next, pointer information is recorded as a reproduction list<br>
pointer table PLT. The pointer information shows a corresponding<br>
relation between the number of one or a plurality of the above setting<br>
reproduction sequence information UDI which are recorded on the DVD<br>
1 at the moment, and the number of the reproduction list set by the<br>
user. Specifically, the reproduction list pointer table PLT is comprised<br>
of play list total information PLG and a first to m-th reproduction list<br>
pointers PLT 1 to PLT m. The play list total information PLG includes a<br>
final address or the like in a region on the DVD 1 where the total<br>
number at the moment of the pointer information and the reproduction<br>
list pointer table PLT are recorded. The reproduction list pointers PLT<br>
1 to PLT m indicate the numbers of the setting reproduction sequence<br>
information UDI, which, are associated with the first to the m-th<br>
reproduction lists set by the user in the above setting reproduction<br>
sequence information UDI, respectively-<br>
Next, a logical format for logically controlling a reproduction<br>
manner upon reproducing the audio information, which is recorded in<br>
the DVD 1 in accordance with the above described physical format, will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 2. The reproduction manner<br>
includes the reproduction order or a range of the audio information to<br>
be reproduced in the audio information.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram for showing the logical format in a<br>
hierarchical structure. However, the audio information on the DVD 1<br>
is recorded in a manner as shown in FIG. 1 and the logical<br>
obtained as a result that a range and a reproduction order of the audio<br>
respective navigation information<br>
described above.<br>
At first a logical format of the above object recording seqence<br>
information OSI will be described.<br>
As described above, the object recording sequence information<br>
OSI is information indicating a recording sequence of respective audio<br>
objects. However, in the case of reproducing the audio objects on the<br>
basis of the object recording sequence information OSI, the user may be<br>
allowed only to reproduce the audio objects in an order of recording, so<br>
that there is only one reproduction manner.<br>
In other words, a first track TR1 is recorded prior to a second<br>
track TR2 in FIG. 2. However, in this case, a reproduction order<br>
capable of being set as the object recording sequence information OSI<br>
has only an order from the first track TR1 to the second track TR2.<br>
The first track TR1 is a track corresponds to a series of the audio<br>
objects to be recorded in the DVD 1 during a period from recording is<br>
commenced once until it is terminated as described above.<br>
Further, one track TR is logically comprised of one or a plurality<br>
of of cells CL. The cells CL are all or a part of one track. In one cell<br>
CL, the audio information is standardized such that they should be<br>
successive. In other words, one track TR is comprised of one cell CL or<br>
more.<br>
Assuming that, for example, a broadcast program for an hour is<br>
recorded in the DVD 1 as the audio object, one track TR is comprised of<br>
only one cell CL as shown in the second track TR2 and the third cell<br>
CL3 of FIG. 2 in this state.<br>
On the other hand, in the case that the object recording sequence<br>
OSI is set in such a manner that the track TR is divided before and after<br>
a part of the formed one track TR so that a part of the formed one track<br>
TR is not capable of being reproduced after the recording, it is only<br>
standardized that the cell CL is divided before and after a part, which is<br>
not capable of being reproduced in the audio DVD standard (refer to the<br>
first track TR1, the first cell CL1 and the second cell CL2 in FIG. 2).<br>
For example, the case corresponds to a case that the audio object<br>
corresponding to a period of a commercial message during the<br>
broadcast program has been on air is deleted so that it cannot be<br>
reproduced, or one track TR is divided for each song after this one track<br>
TR is formed by plurality of songs or the like.<br>
In the above case, as described later, according to the present<br>
embodiment, the object recording sequence information OSI is edited so<br>
that the track TR itself is divided in accordance to division of the cell CL<br>
(refer to FIG. 5 to be described later).<br>
Next, in a relation between respective cells CL physically<br>
configured, and respective audio objects logically formed, one cell CL is<br>
ordinary associated with one audio object as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Therefore, for example, if one cell CL is deleted on the object recording<br>
sequence information OSI, a corresponding audio object also becomes<br>
unnecessary to be reproduced.<br>
Further, a logical format of the above setting reproduction<br>
sequence information UDI will be described.<br>
As described above, the setting reproduction sequence<br>
information UDI (user defined program chain) is also referred to as a<br>
reproduction list in the audio DVD standard. The user sets and<br>
records the setting reproduction sequence information UDI so that the<br>
user can arbitrarily reproduce a part or all of a plurality of audio objects<br>
in an arbitrary order.<br>
In the above case, the above described track TR does not exist in<br>
the setting reproduction sequence information UDI. Further, it is<br>
possible to set a plurality of setting reproduction sequence information<br>
UDI.<br>
Next, one setting reproduction sequence information UDI is<br>
logically comprised of one or a plurality of defined cells UD as shown in<br>
FIG. 2. In this case, one defined cell UD comprises information, which<br>
logically shows reproduction segments arbitrarily set by the user<br>
(reproduction segments as a part of the respective audio objects) and a<br>
reproduction order between respective reproduction segments. This<br>
defined cell UD is set so as to reproduce respective audio objects with<br>
making reference to them. This is an artifice in a standard to realize a<br>
plurality of reproduction manners with changing original audio objects<br>
as little as possible.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIG. 2, logically setting a first<br>
defined cell UDI, a second defined cell UD2, a third defined cell UD3<br>
and a fourth defined cell UD4, then, one setting reproduction sequence<br>
information UDI is comprised of defining these defined cells so that they<br>
are reproduced in such an order that the first defined cell UDI, the<br>
second defined cell UD2, the third defined cell UD3, and the fourth<br>
defined cell UD4. The first defined cell UDI designates a part of the<br>
first object OBJ1 as a reproduction segment. The second defined cell<br>
UD2 designates a part of the second object OBJ1 as a reproduction<br>
segment. The third defined cell UD3 and the fourth defined cell UD4<br>
designate various parts of the third object OBJ3, respectively, as<br>
reproduction segments.<br>
Next, an embodiment according to the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 8.<br>
At first, a schematic configuration of an information recording<br>
reproduction apparatus according to the present embodiment will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a block diagram for<br>
showing a schematic configuration of the information recording<br>
reproduction apparatus.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, an information recording reproduction<br>
apparatus S according to the embodiment is comprised of a pickup 2 as<br>
a recording device, a modulator 3, a formatter 4, an encoder 5, a timing<br>
generator 6, a system controller 7 as a generating and recording device,<br>
a memory 9, a demodulator 10, a decoder 11, a switch 12, a servo IC<br>
(Integrated Circuit) 13, a spindle motor 14 and an operation unit 15 as<br>
a designation device and a reproduction designation device.<br>
Additionally, the system controller 7 is provided with a navigation<br>
information generator 8.<br>
Further, the timing generator 6 is comprised of a detecting circuit<br>
6A and an addition circuit 6B.<br>
Next, schematic operations of respective units will be explained<br>
below.<br>
The spindle motor 14 rotates the DVD 1 with predetermined<br>
number of revolutions on the basis of a spindle controlling signal Sss<br>
from the servo IC13.<br>
On the other hand, recording information Sr including the audio<br>
information to be recorded in the DVD 1 is inputted from the outside,<br>
then, it is inputted in the encoder 5, one input terminal of the switch 12<br>
and the detecting circuit 6A.<br>
Further, the encoder 5 performs a predetermined encoding<br>
processing, which is specifically, for example, compression encoding<br>
processing in an MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) system, with<br>
respect to the recording information Sr on the basis of a controlling<br>
signal Sce from the system controller 7 and generates a encoding signal<br>
Sre to output it to the formatter 4.<br>
Thus, the formatter 4 superimposes a navigation information<br>
signal Snd from the navigation information generator 8 to be described<br>
later and the above encoding signal Sre on the basis of a controlling<br>
signal Scf from the system controller 7 so that they are formed in a<br>
physical format. Then, the formatter 4 generates a superimposed<br>
signal Sf to output it to the modulator 3.<br>
After that, the modulator 3 provides the superimposed signal Sf<br>
with predetermined modulation processing, which is specifically, for<br>
example, 8-16 modulation processing, and generates a modulation<br>
signal Sfe to outputted it to the pickup 2.<br>
Thus, the pickup 2 generates an optical beam B, whose strength<br>
is modulated by the modulation signal Sfe, and irradiates, it to an<br>
information track in an information recording surface (not illustrated) of<br>
the DVD 1, so that pits in associated with the navigation information,<br>
which is included in the modulation signal Sfe and the audio<br>
information are generated on the information track. Thus, the pickup<br>
2 records the navigation information and the audio information on the<br>
DVD 1 in a physical format shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In the above case, an objective lens (illustrate) in the pickup 2 (an objective lens for<br>
condensing the optical beam B) is moved in the above vertical and horizontal directions<br>
on the basis of a pickup servo signal Ssp to be outputted from the servo IC 13. Namely,<br>
focus servo controlling and tracking servo controlling are performed. As a result, the<br>
declination between a condensing position of the optical beam B and the above<br>
information track in a vertical and horizontal directions with respect to the above<br>
information recording surface is dissolved.<br>
Therefore, the servo IC13 generates the above spindle controlling signal Sss and a<br>
pickup signal Ssp on the basis of a controlling signal Ssc from the system Controller 7<br>
to output these signals to the spindle motor 14 and the pickup 2, respectively.<br>
On one hand, in the case of reproducing the audio information or the like, which has<br>
been already recorded in the DVD 1, the pickup 2 generates the optical beam B to be<br>
reproduced having certain strength and irradiates it to the information track in which the<br>
above pits are formed. Then, the pickup 2 generates a detecting signal Spp in<br>
associated with the audio information or the like on the basis of its reflection light and<br>
outputs it to be demodulator 10.<br>
Thus, the demodulator 10 provides the detecting signal Spp with demodulation<br>
processing in associated with the modulation processing in the above modulator 3, and<br>
generates a demodulation signal Spd to output it to the decoder 11.<br>
Then, the decoder 11 provides the demodulation signal Spd with decoding processing in<br>
associated with the encoding processing in the above encoder 5 on the basis of a<br>
controlling signal Scd from the system<br>
controller 7, and generates a decoding signal Sd to output it to other<br>
input terminal of the switch 12 and the detecting circuit 6A.<br>
After that, the switch 12 selects any one of the above recording<br>
information Sr and the above decoding signal Sd on the basis of a<br>
controlling signal Scs from the system controller 7 and outputs it to an<br>
exterior amplifier or the like (not illustrated) as an output signal Sout.<br>
Alternatively, in the editorial processing of the embodiment to be<br>
described later, the switch 12 is always switched to a decoding signal<br>
Sd's side.<br>
On the other hand, the operation unit 15 generates an operation<br>
signal Sin in associated with the operation and outputs it to the system<br>
controller 7 through the timing generator 6 when the operation is<br>
performed by the user to perform the processing in the information<br>
recording reproduction apparatus S.<br>
Upon performing the editorial processing of the embodiment to be<br>
described later, when the operation is performed to divide respective<br>
tracks TR, the operation unit 15 generates the operation signal Sin<br>
indicating that respective tracks TR arc divided in this timing.<br>
Next, upon performing the above editorial processing, the timing<br>
generator 6 generates a timing signal Stm indication a timing at which<br>
the edition should be performed oh the basis of the above recording<br>
information Sr, the decoding signal Sd and the operation signal Sin<br>
output this signal to the navigation information generator 8,<br>
More specifically, the detecting circuit 6A in the timing generator<br>
6 detects the recording information Sr and a silent portion of the<br>
decoding signal Sd, and generates a detecting signal Spu to output it to<br>
the addition circuit 6B. Then, the addition circuit 6B adds the<br>
detecting signal Spu and an operation signal Sh from the operation unit<br>
15, and generates the above timing signal Stm to output it.<br>
Thus, the timing signal Stm is outputted to the navigation<br>
information generator 8 at both of a timing that the above dividing<br>
operation is performed in the operation unit 15 and a timing that the<br>
detecting circuit 6A detects the recording information Sr and the silent<br>
portion of the decoding signal Sd.<br>
Alternatively, in the case that the recording information Sr has<br>
boundary information showing a boundary of a song in its data, the<br>
detecting circuit 6A detects this boundary information.<br>
Thus, the navigation information generator 8 generates the above<br>
navigation information signal Snd including the above respective<br>
navigation information after the editorial processing on the basis of the<br>
timing signal Stm and outputs it to one input terminal of the formatter<br>
4.<br>
As a result, the audio information in the encoding signal Sre and<br>
the navigation information in the navigation information signal Snd are<br>
superimposed by the above formatter 4, so that the above superimposed<br>
signal Sf including the audio information or the like, which has the<br>
physical format shown in FIG. 1, is generated.<br>
In parallel with these operations, the system controller 7 gives<br>
and receives information necessary as a memory signal Sm to and from<br>
the memory 9, generates respective controlling signals See, Scf, Ssc,<br>
Scd and Scs for controlling the above respective operations and outputs<br>
them to component materials in associated with respective controlling<br>
signals.<br>
Next, editorial processing of the object recording sequence<br>
information OSI according to the embodiment will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 4 to FIG. 6.<br>
Additionally, the editorial processing to be described below edits<br>
the track TR, which is recorded once in the DVD 1 in accordance with<br>
the physical format shown in FIG. 1, and the object recording sequence<br>
information OSI in associated with the track TR so that they are divided<br>
after the recording.<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 4 is a flow chart for showing the editorial<br>
processing, which is mainly performed in the system controller 7. FIG.<br>
5 and FIG. 6 are diagrams for specifically illustrating the object<br>
recording sequence information OSI before and after the division.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, according to the editorial processing of the<br>
present embodiment, at first, reproduction of the audio information,<br>
which has been already recorded in the DVD 1 as the track TR (a track<br>
TR to be divided), is commenced (step SI). In this case the switch 12,<br>
which has been switched to the decoding signal Sd's side reproduces<br>
the audio information via the pickup 2, the demodulator 10, the<br>
decoder 11 and the switch 12.<br>
If reproduction of the audio information is commenced, then, it is<br>
determined whether the desired dividing processing, i.e., the editorial<br>
processing of the object recording sequence information OSI is<br>
completed or not (step S2). If it is all completed (step S2; YES),<br>
termination processing is performed (step S3) and the editorial<br>
processing is terminated. For example, the termination processing<br>
includes the processing of recording of the termination information to<br>
be recorded in the lead-out area LO or the like.<br>
On one hand, in the determination in the step S2, if all of the<br>
editorial processing is not completed (step S2; NO), then, it is<br>
determined whether or not the operation signal Sin indicating that the<br>
track TR is divided is inputted from the operation unit 15 (step S4).<br>
Further, if the operation signal Sin is not inputted (step S4; NO), the<br>
processing returns to the step S2 so as to wait until the operation signal<br>
Sin is inputted. On the contrary, if it is inputted (step S4; YES), then,<br>
it is determined whether or not the division timing indicated by the<br>
timing signal Stm in associated with the operation signal Sin is a timing<br>
in the middle of reproduction of one audio object unit AOBU.(step S5).<br>
Further, if the division timing is a timing in the middle of<br>
reproduction of one audio object unit AOBU (step S5; YES), the<br>
processing waits until a timing that the reproduction of the audio object<br>
unit AOBU is terminated comes since it is assumed that the editorial or<br>
deletion processing or the like is not performed in the middle of one<br>
audio object unit AOBU as described above.<br>
On the other hand, if the division timing indicated by the timing<br>
signal Stm is not a timing in the middle of one audio object unit AOBU<br>
(step S5; NO), then, the address information in a recording termination<br>
position in the audio object to be reproduced before the division timing<br>
in the corresponding object recording sequence information OSI and a<br>
reproduction termination time of the cell CL to be reproduced before the<br>
division timing are changed on the object recording sequence<br>
information OSI (step S6). Simultaneously, updating of a track<br>
number of a new track TR, of which the reproduction is commenced<br>
after the division timing, and the audio object number and rewriting of<br>
the address information of the address information in the recording<br>
start position of the new track TR are performed on the object recording<br>
sequence information OSI (step S7). Then, at the next division timing,<br>
the processing returns to step S2 so as to repeat the same processing.<br>
Next, it is clearly explained how the object recording sequence<br>
information OSI is edited in the above editorial processing with<br>
reference to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6.<br>
Additionally, according to a following explanation, in one DVD 1,<br>
a first track 20 having a reproduction time of 19 minutes, 59 seconds<br>
and 2 frames (1 frame is equivalent to 1/30 second) shown in the<br>
logical format in FIG. 5 is divided into a first track 30, of which<br>
reproduction time is just 10 minutes, and a second track 31, of which<br>
reproduction time is 9 minutes, 59 seconds and 2 frames.<br>
Simultaneously, according to a following explanation, a second track 21<br>
having a reproduction time of 29 minutes, 59 seconds and 29 frames is<br>
divided into a third track 32, of which reproduction time is just 15<br>
minutes, a fourth track 33, of which reproduction time is just 10<br>
minutes, and a fifth track 34, of which reproduction time is 9 minutes,<br>
59 seconds and 29 frames.<br>
With respect to the logical format before and after division, a first<br>
audio object 22 and a first cell 24 are associated with the first track 20<br>
before division. Simultaneously, a second audio object 23 and a<br>
second cell 25 are associated with the second track 21.<br>
Alternatively, after division, a first audio object 35 and a first cell<br>
40 are associated with the first track 30, a second audio object 36 and a<br>
second cell 41 are associated with the second track 31, a third audio<br>
object 37 and a third cell 42 are associated with the third track 32, a<br>
fourth audio object 38 and a fourth cell 43 are associated with the<br>
fourth track 33, and a fifth audio object 39 and a fifth cell 44 are<br>
associated with the fifth track 34, respectively.<br>
At first, contents of the object recording sequence information OSI<br>
before division will be described by using FIG. 6A.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6A, before division illustrated in FIG. 5, the<br>
object recording sequence information OSI includes a program chain<br>
general information 50, first track information 51 (its value is "1"),<br>
second track information 52 (its value is "1"), a first cell information<br>
search pointer 53, a second cell information search pointer 54, first cell<br>
information 55 and second cell information 56. The program chain<br>

"2"), in which the total number of the tracks TR recorded in the DVD 1<br>
is described, and a cell information search pointer total number 50B (its<br>
value is "2"), in which the total number of the cell information search<br>
pointers to be described later is described. The total number of the<br>
cells CL included in the first track 20 before division is described in the<br>
first track information 51. The total number of the cells CL included in<br>
the second track 21 before division is described in the second track<br>
information 52. A recording position (recording address) on the DVD 1,<br>
in which the first cell information 55 to be described later is described,<br>
is described in the first cell information search pointer 53. A recording<br>
position on the DVD 1, in which the second cell information 56 to be<br>
described later is described, is described in the second cell information<br>
search pointer 54. The first cell information 55 includes first cell start<br>
time information 55A (its value is "0 minute, 0 second and 0 frame)), in<br>
which a reproduction start time of the first cell 24 before division is<br>
described, and first cell termination time information 55B (its value is<br>
"19 minutes, 59 seconds and 2 frames), in which a reproduction<br>
termination time of the first cell 24 is described. The second cell<br>
information 56 includes second cell start time information 56A (its<br>
value is "0 minute, 0 second and 0 frame)), in which a reproduction start<br>
time of the second cell 25 before division is described, and second cell<br>
termination time information 56B (its value is "29 minutes, 59 seconds<br>
and 29 frames), in which a reproduction termination time of the second<br>
cell 25 is described.<br>
Next, contents of an object recording sequence information OSI'<br>
after respective tracks TR in associated with the -. object recording<br>
sequence information OSI shown in FIG. 6A are divided by, the above<br>
editorial processing in a form shown in FIG. 5 will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 6B<br>
As shown in FIG. 6B, after division illustrated in FIG. 5 the<br>
object recording sequence information OSI' includes a program chain<br>
general information 60, first track information 61 (its value is "1")<br>
second track information 62 (its value is "1"), third track information 63<br>
(its value is "1"), fourth track information 64 (its value is "1"), fifth track<br>

Next, reproduction processing of an embodiment by the use of the<br>
object file information OFI or the like illustrated in FIG. 7 will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
Alternatively, the switch 12 is switched to the decoding signal<br>
Sd's side when the reproduction processing is performed<br>
Additionally, reproduction processing explained below is<br>
reproduction processing for searching a position after a time of Ts<br>
seconds from a head of the data area DA in the DVD 1 as a<br>
reproduction time and reproducing the audio information recorded in<br>
this position. In this case, reproduction time in associated with one<br>
audio object unit AOBU is assumed to be t seconds.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, according to the reproduction processing, at<br>
first, when the reproduction time Ts is designated by the user (step<br>
S20), a parameter n indicating the number of the audio object is set to<br>
"1" (step S21). The number is a continuous number in the case that<br>
the number of the audio object recorded in a head of the data area DA<br>
is assumed to be "1". Then, the reproduction time Tn at the head of<br>
the audio object to be illustrated by the parameter n is compared with<br>
the above reproduction time Ts (step S22).<br>
If the reproduction time Tn is ahead of the reproduction time Ts<br>
(step S22; YES), it is assumed that the irradiating position of the optical<br>
beam B does not reach a desired reproduction position. Then, the<br>
parameter n is increased by "1" (step S23) and the processing returns to<br>
the step S22.<br>
On one hand, if it is determined that the reproduction time Tn is<br>
behind of the reproduction time Ts in the step S22 (Step S22; NO), it is<br>
assumed that the irradiating position of the optical beam B passes the<br>
desired reproduction position by one audio object. Then, the<br>
parameter n is decreased by "1" (step S24). Therefore, a n-th audio<br>
object obtained by this processing is an audio object including the<br>
reproduction time Ts. Next, difference between the reproduction time<br>
Tn and the reproduction time Ts is divided by the reproduction time t of<br>
one audio object unit AOBU and its quotient is defined as k and its<br>
remainder is defined as r (step S25).<br>
According to this processing in the step S25, it is perceived that<br>
the desired reproduction time Ts is equivalent to a position after r<br>
seconds from the head of the k-th audio object unit AOBU in the n-th<br>
audio object.<br>
Next, detection of the k-th audio object unit AOBU is commenced<br>
(step S26). Further, the audio information is reproduced from a<br>
position after r seconds from the above position (step S27) and the<br>
processing is terminated.<br>
As described above, according to the dividing processing of the<br>
track TR by edition of the object recording sequence OSI of the<br>
embodiment, generating the object recording sequence information OSI'<br>
after division to record it in the DVD 1 as shown in FIG. 6B is repeated<br>
every time the division is designated, so that it is possible to record the<br>
object recording sequence information OSI' for dividing the original<br>
track TR (the first track 20 and the second track 21) in a manner<br>
desired by the user to reproduce it.<br>
Additionally, since the recorded audio information is reproduced<br>
and simultaneously division is designated, it is possible that the user<br>
confirms the contents of the audio information and simultaneously the<br>
object recording sequence information OSI' after division is generated.<br>
Further, since respective cell information in the object recording<br>
sequence information OSI' include the reproduction time information of<br>
respective cells after division and the order information, it is possible<br>
that respective tracks after division are capable of being certainly<br>
reproduced in a reproduction manner, which is desired by the user.<br>
Further, since the DVD 1 capable of recording is used as the<br>
information recording medium, large quantity of audio information can<br>
be recorded and simultaneously reproduced in such a manner that the<br>
user desired.<br>
(III) Modified Embodiment<br>
Next, a modified embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart for illustrating editorial processing<br>
according to a modified embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the above described embodiment, the editorial processing for<br>
reproducing the audio information, which is once recorded, and<br>
simultaneously dividing the track TR is described. However, in<br>
addition to this, the present invention can be also applied to the case<br>
that a series of the audio information is divided and recorded upon<br>
recording this series of the audio information in the DVD 1, in which no<br>
audio information is recorded.<br>
Since the configuration of the information recording reproduction<br>
apparatus according to the modified embodiment is the same as the<br>
configuration of the information recording reproduction apparatus S of<br>
the embodiment other than that the switch 12 is always switched to the<br>
recording information Sr's side, the explanation thereof is omitted<br>
below.<br>
In the editorial processing in the modified embodiment, as shown<br>
in FIG. 9, at first, the audio information recording is commenced (step<br>
S10). Then, the audio object unit AOBU is generated by the above<br>
described processing to be recorded in the DVD 1 (step S11).<br>
After that, it is determined whether or not the audio information<br>
recording is completed or not (step S12). If the recording processing is<br>
not completed (step S12; NO), then, it is determined whether a<br>
boundary of a song in the recording information Sr is detected (step<br>
S14).<br>
In the above case, in the processing of the step S14, specifically,<br>
the boundary is detected at timing that the detecting circuit 6A in the<br>
timing generator 6 detects the silent portion of the recording<br>
information Sr.<br>
When the boundary of the song is detected by the determination<br>
in the step S14 (step S14; YES), the address information of the<br>
recording termination position in the audio object to be reproduced<br>
before the boundary timing in the corresponding object recording<br>
sequence information OSI and the reproduction termination of the cell<br>
CL to be reproduced before the boundary timing are newly generated as<br>
the object recording sequence information OSI (step S16). Further, a<br>
new audio object and a new track TR are generated with respect to the<br>
audio information, which has been recorded up to the boundary (steps<br>
S17 and S18) and the processing returns to the step S11 so as to repeat<br>
the same processing at the boundary timing to come next.<br>
On one hand, if the boundary of the song is not detected in the<br>
determination of the step S14 (step S14; NO), then, it is determined<br>
whether or not the operation signal Sin, which intends to divide the<br>
track TR generated up to that time, is inputted from the operation unit<br>
15 (step S15). If the operation signal Sin is not inputted (step S15;<br>
NO), the processing shifts to the step Sll as it is. On the contrary, if it<br>
is inputted (step S15; YES), the processing shifts to the above step S16<br>
and performs the above described processing thereafter.<br>
If it is detected that recording processing is completely terminated<br>
in the determination of the step S12 (step S12; YES), then, the address<br>
information of the recording termination position in the last audio<br>
abject and the reproduction termination time of the last cell CL are<br>
generated as the object recording sequence information OSI (step S19).<br>
Then, the predetermined termination processing is performed (step S20)<br>
and the recording processing is terminated. The predetermined<br>
termination processing includes, for example, the processing of<br>
recording of the termination information to be recorded in the read out<br>
area LO or the like.<br>
As the object recording sequence information OSI to be generated<br>
after the editorial processing shown in FIG. 9 is performed, for example,<br>
the object recording sequence information OSI illustrated in FIG. 6A is<br>
generated as well as the recording processing. In this case, the<br>
boundary of the song is detected in the audio information to be<br>
recorded only when ten minutes zero second has been passed after the<br>
recording is commenced.<br>
As described above, according to the editorial processing of the<br>
object recording sequence information OSI in the modified embodiment,<br>
the object recording sequence information OSI before and after the<br>
boundary of the song is generates in such a manner that it is shown in<br>
FIG. 6A and simultaneously, recording the audio information is<br>
repeated for each boundary timing of the song. As a result, it is<br>
possible to record the object recording sequence information OSI for<br>
dividing and reproducing the recording information Sr in such a<br>
manner that the user desires as well as it is possible to divide and<br>
record the recording information Sr to be continuously inputted in such<br>
a manner that the user desires in the DVD 1.<br>
Additionally, since respective cell information in the object<br>
recording sequence information OSI include the reproduction time<br>
information and the order information of respective cells after division,<br>
it is possible to certainly reproduce respective tracks after division in<br>
such a reproduction manner that the user desires.<br>
Further, since the DVD 1 capable of recording is used as the<br>
information recording medium, large quantity of the audio information<br>
is capable of being recorded as well as this is capable of being<br>
reproduces in such a reproduction manner that the user desires.<br>
Alternatively, the present invention is not limited to the above<br>
described embodiment.<br>
In other words, for example, in the processing shown in FIG. 4, it<br>
is described that the audio object is divided when the operation signal<br>
Sin indicating that respective tracks TR are divided from the operation<br>
unit 15. However, in addition to this, the audio object may be<br>
automatically divided in response to that the detector 6A detects the<br>
silent portion of the decoding signal Sd.<br>
Additionally, according to the above described embodiment and<br>
the modified embodiment, the present invention is applied to the audio<br>
DVD recorder, which employs the audio DVD standard. However, in<br>
addition to this, the present invention may be applied to the video DVD<br>
recorder, which employs a standard of the video DVD.<br>
The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The<br>
present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as<br>
illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being<br>
indicated by the appended claims rather than by the forgoing<br>
description and all changes which come within the meaning and range<br>
of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraces<br>
therein.<br>
