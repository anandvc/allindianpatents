				<td>BODY WASH COMPOSITION TO IMPART CONDITIONING PROPERTIES TO SKIN<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a body wash composition and to a method of treating skin that cleanses and imparts conditioning properties to the skin. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a body wash composition comprising: (a) an anionic surfactant, like an alkyl ether sulfate, such as sodium lauryl ether sulfate; (b) a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, such as a quaternized guar gum; and (c) a guaternized phosphate ester, in an aqueous carrier. The body wash compositions of the present invention exhibit a minimal interaction, if any, between the cationic components and the anionic components, making the anionic components and the cationic components available to effectively cleanse and condition the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Individuals buy and use a skin cleanser, either in a bar or liquid form, primarily for its cleansing properties. However, skin cleansers often dry the skin because protective oils are removed from the skin during the cleansing process. The consumer, therefore, desires a skin cleanser that leaves the skin in a cosmetically satisfactory condition.<br>
Present-day skin cleansers often are formu¬lated with highly effective soaps and synthetic surfactants, particularly anionic surfactants, that effectively cleanse the skin. However, after washing, the skin can be left in a cosmetically unsatisfactory<br><br>
state because soap and anionic surfactant-based skin cleansers not only remove the dirt and soil from the skin, but also remove oils that are naturally present on the surface of the skin. Therefore, the properties of anionic surfactants that effectively cleanse the skin also serve to leave the skin in a cosmetically unsatisfactory condition. Nonionic and amphoteric surfactants are less irritating to the skin than anionic surfactants, but are not as effective in cleansing the skin. To strike a balance between cleansing the skin and leaving the skin in a cosmetic-ally satisfactory condition, present-day liquid skin cleansers typically are based on nonionic or amphoter¬ic surfactants.<br>
Accordingly, skin that has been repeatedly washed with an anionic surfactant-based skin cleanser, or a soap, often requires treatment with a skin-condi¬tioning composition to replenish the oil and moisture removed from the skin, and to generally improve the unsatisfactory physical and cosmetic condition of the skin. Conditioning compositions, such as hand creams or lotions, normally are applied after washing, and can be gel or a cream-like in consistency and contain oils. Therefore, investigators have sought body wash compositions that both cleanse the skin and leave the skin in a cosmetically satisfactory state, such that the subsequent treatment with a conditioner composi¬tion can be reduced or avoided.<br>
Investigations directed at providing a composition that behaves both as a skin cleanser and as a skin conditioner yielded compositions that possessed several disadvantages. Investigators, therefore, attempted to combine anionic surfactants with cationic conditioners.<br><br>
It is known in the art that anionic surfactants are suitable for cleansing the skin, and that, in many instances, cationic surfactants and cationic polymers are suitable skin conditioners. However, the major difficulty encountered by investi¬gators is the inherent incompatibility between an anionic surfactant and a cationic surfactant or cationic polymer. Contact between the anionic surfac¬tant and the cationic surfactant or cationic polymer either produces an intractable precipitate that forms immediately, or causes an interaction between the anionic and cationic components that significantly reduces their respective cleansing and conditioning properties. The reduction in cleansing and condi¬tioning effectiveness also is observed in compositions wherein the anionic and cationic components do not precipitate from the composition, but remain in solution or in a suspended state.<br>
This incompatibility between an anionic compound and a cationic compound is well recognized by workers skilled in the art. For example, Sagarin, in Cosmetics, Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 538, (1957), discloses that anionic and cationic com¬pounds cannot be used in combination because they react to form insoluble salts. Investigators, there¬fore, have combined conditioners with nonionic or amphoteric surfactants to overcome this incompatibili¬ty problem. However, this advantage was offset by the relatively poor cleaning ability of a nonionic or amphoteric surfactant compared to an anionic surfac¬tant.<br>
Preferred body wash compositions, therefore, are anionic in character. The incorporation of a cationic conditioning compound into an anionic body<br><br>
wash composition ranges from difficult to impossible because of the inherent incompatibility between anionic and cationic surfactants. Nevertheless, such a composition is desirable because of the convenience such a combination product offers to the consumer. In such a product, the anionic surfactant acts to rid the skin of dirt, surface film, debris, and the like, while the cationic compound deposits on the skin to provide conditioning benefits. However, until the composition and method of the present invention, it has proven very difficult to provide a stable anionic surfactant-based composition because of the inherent incompatibility between cationic and anionic surfac¬tants .<br>
Consequently, and in accordance with an important feature of the present invention, a polymer¬ic cationic conditioning compound and a cationic conditioning surfactant, i.e., a quaternized phosphate ester, are incorporated into a composition wherein an interaction between the anionic and cationic compo¬nents of the composition is essentially precluded. The body wash composition then is utilized to clean the skin, and, simultaneously, to impart conditioning properties to the skin.<br>
The need for an effective and stable body wash composition that cleanses and conditions the skin in a single treatment has long been recognized in the art. Some body wash compositions are specially formu¬lated for mildness, and, accordingly, low detergency, in order to leave a portion of the natural oils on the skin. The present invention is directed to a body wash composition that also effectively cleanses the skin.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a body wash composition for cleansing and imparting improved physical and cosmetic properties to the skin. In accordance with the present invention, anionic surfactants can be combined with a polymeric cationic conditioning compound and a quaternized phosphate ester to provide a stable and effective body wash composition. As manufactured, the composition is metastable, wherein the term "metastable composition" is defined as a composition that is sufficiently stable to resist phase separation during storage and essentially precludes an interaction between the cationic and anionic components of the composition; but, upon application to the skin, deposits a substan¬tial amount of the cationic components onto the skin. It also has been found that the optional addition of other conditioning agents, like oils, to the body wash composition of the present invention further improves the conditioning properties imparted to the skin.<br>
More particularly, it has been found that a polymeric cationic conditioning compound and a cation¬ic quaternized phosphate ester, when incorporated into a body wash composition including a nonsubstantive anionic surfactant and an optional oil, provide a body wash composition that generates sufficient foaming and thoroughly cleanses the skin, in addition to deposit¬ing a sufficient amount of the cationic polymer, the quaternized phosphate ester, and optional oil onto the skin to condition the skin. Such results are unex¬pected in the art because anionic surfactants, as a class, are essentially incompatible with cationic compounds. The compatibility demonstrated by the combination of the anionic surfactant and the quater¬nized phosphate ester and the cationic conditioning<br><br>
polymer utilized in the present invention permits sufficient deposition of the substantive cationic conditioning components onto the skin, while the anionic surfactant cleanses the skin.<br>
The present invention is directed to a body wash composition comprising a nonsubstantive and high-foaming anionic surfactant and a combination of sub¬stantive cationic conditioning components, that simul¬taneously cleanses and imparts desirable physical and cosmetic properties to the skin. In contrast to the prior art, wherein cationic polymers were blended primarily with amphoteric surfactants, the body wash composition of the present invention comprises a cat-ionic polymer, a quaternized phosphate ester, an op¬tional oil, and an anionic surfactant to cleanse and condition the skin. Therefore, the stability and incompatibility problems normally encountered when a cationic surfactant and anionic surfactant are present in the same composition have been overcome.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a composition and method of cleansing and conditioning skin. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a method of treating the skin, whereby the skin is cleansed and conditioned, simultaneously, by contacting the skin with a body wash composition comprising an anionic surfactant, a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, and a quaternized phosphate ester in an aqueous carrier. Optionally, an oil, like castor oil, or an amphoteric surfactant, like a betaine or a hydroxysultaine, or a nonionic surfac¬tant, like an alkanolamide, can be included in the<br><br>
composition to improve the esthetic properties and consumer appeal of the composition. Consequently, treating the skin with single application of an aqueous composition including an anionic surfactant, such as an alkyl ether sulfate, like sodium lauryl ether sulfate; a polymeric cationic conditioning com¬pound, like a quaternized guar gum; a quaternized phosphate ester, such as a C8-C22 alkamidopropyl phos-phatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, and, optionally, an oil, like castor oil, effectively cleanses the skin and simultaneously imparts conditioning properties to the skin.<br>
Therefore, one aspect of the present inven¬tion is to provide a body wash composition that cleanses the skin and that imparts improved physical and cosmetic properties to the skin in a single application.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a body wash composition comprising an anionic surfactant, a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, a quaternized phosphate ester, and, option¬ally, an oil, an amphoteric surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof, in an aqueous carrier.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating skin with a body wash composition to simultaneously cleanse and condition the skin with a single application of the composition to the skin.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating skin to yield cleansed and conditioned skin by contacting the skin with an aqueous composition comprising about 1% to about 40% by weight of an anionic surfactant, about<br><br>
0.01% to about 2% by weight of a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, and about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of a quaternized phosphate ester.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating skin to yield cleansed, conditioned skin by contacting the skin with an aqueous composition comprising about 1% to about 40% by weight of an anionic surfactant, from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, about 0,01% to about 5% by weight of a quaternized phosphate triester, and, optionally, 0% to about 4% by weight of an oil, such as castor oil, 0% to about 5% by weight of an ampho-teric surfactant, such as betaine or a hydroxypropyl-sultaine, and 0% to about 10% by weight of a nonionic surfactant, like an alkanolamide, or combinations thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating skin to yield, in a single treatment, cleansed and well-conditioned skin by contacting the skin with an aqueous composition comprising about 1% to about 40% by weight of an anionic surfactant, about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of quaternized guar gum as the polymeric cationic conditioning compound, about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of stearamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, as the cationic conditioning surfactant, and 0% to about 2% by weight of castor oil.<br>
These and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A body wash composition of the present invention comprises an anionic surfactant, a polymeric cationic conditioning compound, and a guaternized phosphate ester, in an aqueous carrier. In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, the body wash composition includes an anionic surfac¬tant and substantive cationic conditioning agents to both cleanse and condition the skin in a single application of the composition to the skin. Surpris¬ingly and unexpectedly, the body wash composition demonstrates excellent stability with respect to resisting phase separation, and with respect to resisting interaction between the anionic and cationic components, thereby avoiding the necessity of includ¬ing an amphoteric or nonionic surfactant in the composition. Optionally, however, an amphoteric surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof, can be included in the composition to impart improved physical properties, and, therefore, enhanced consumer appeal to the composition. Furthermore, an oil can be optionally included in the composition to enhance skin conditioning.<br>
The anionic surfactant used in the composi¬tion and method of the present invention includes any of the anionic surfactants known or previously used in the art of skin cleansers. However, an anionic surfactant is a necessary ingredient in the composi¬tion of the present invention because it effectively cleanses the skin and generates a high, stable foam level that consumers equate with cleaning efficiency. Nonionic and amphoteric surfactants generally are not as effective in cleansing the skin and do not provide<br><br>
the high foam level desired by consumers. Therefore, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants are unsatisfactory as the primary cleansing surfactant in a composition of the present invention. However, optionally, nonionic or amphoteric surfactants can be included in a composition of the present invention to help in¬crease and stabilize foam, to provide a suitable viscosity, or to provide other functional or esthetic properties to the composition.<br>
Usually, the anionic surfactant includes a hydrophobic moiety, such as a carbon chain including about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, and particularly about 12 to about 20 carbon atoms, and further in¬cludes a hydrophilic moiety, such as sulfate, sulfo-nate, carbonate, phosphate, or carboxylate. Often, the hydrophobic carbon chain is etherified, such as with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, to impart a particular physical property, such as increased water solubility or reduced surface tension to the anionic surfactant.<br>
The anionic surfactants are well known and have been widely used in the art of skin cleansers. Therefore, suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, compounds in the classes known as alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl ether sulfonates, sulfate esters of an alkylphenoxy polyoxy-ethylene ethanol, alpha-olefin sulfonates, beta-alkyloxy alkane sulfonates, alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl monoglyceride sulfates, alkyl monoglyceride sulfonates, alkyl carbonates, alkyl ether carboxyl-ates, fatty acids, sulfosuccinates, sarcosinates, octoxynol or nonoxynol phosphates, taurates, fatty taurides, fatty acid amido polyoxyethylene sulfates, isothionates, or mixtures thereof. Additional anionic<br><br>
cleansing surfactants are listed in McCUTCHEON'S EMULSIFIERS AND DETERGENTS, 1993 ANNUALS, McCutcheon Division, MC Publishing Co., Glen Rock, NJ, pages 263-266, incorporated herein by reference. Numerous other anionic surfactants, and classes of anionic surfac¬tants, are disclosed in Laughlin et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,929,678, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Usually, the anionic surfactant is present in the composition as a neutralized salt in the form of a sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, alkyl-ammonium or hydroxyalkylammonium salt, wherein the alkyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety has 1 to about 3 carbon atoms. The alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates are particularly effective classes of anionic surfac¬tants. Examples of anionic surfactants useful in the composition and method of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the ammonium, mono-ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, iso-propylamine, sodium, potassium, lithium, and magnesium salts of lauryl sulfate, dodecylbenzenesulfonate, lauryl sulfosuccinate, lauryl ether sulfate, lauryl ether carboxylate, lauryl sarcosinate, cocomethyl tauride, and sulfosuccinate half ester amide, or combinations thereof. Examples of especially useful anionic surfactants are a lauryl sulfate salt, a lauryl ether sulfate salt, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, the anionic surfactant is pres¬ent in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 40%, and preferably about 5% to about 35%, by weight of the composition. To achieve the full advan¬tage of the present invention, the body wash composi¬tion contains about 8% to about 30% by weight anionic surfactants.<br><br>
If the anionic surfactant is present in an amount of less than about 1% by weight of the composi¬tion, then the skin is not sufficiently cleansed when contacted with a composition of the present invention. Furthermore, if the anionic surfactant is present in amounts greater than about 40% by weight of the compo¬sition, greater cleansing efficacy is not demonstrat¬ed, and the amount of anionic surfactant above about 40% by weight is wasted. It should be understood, however, that the anionic surfactant can be present in amounts greater than about 40% by weight without adversely affecting the physical, esthetic, or func¬tional properties of the body wash composition.<br>
In accordance with another important feature of the present invention, the body wash composition includes a polymeric cationic conditioning compound that is substantive and imparts conditioning proper¬ties to skin. Both synthetic and naturally derived polymers having a quaternized nitrogen atom are useful in the composition and method of the present inven¬tion. Such useful cationic polymers have a weight average molecular weight of at least 100,000, and preferably at least 200,000, and up to about 1,000,000. A preferred weight average molecular weight is from about 250,000 to about 750,000.<br>
Examples of synthetic quaternized polymers include, but are not limited to, polyquaternium-1, polyquaternium-2, polyquaternium-5, polyquaternium-6, polyquaternium-7, polyquaternium-8, polyquaternium-9, polyquaternium-11, polyquaternium-12, polyquaternium-13, polyquaternium-14, polyquaternium-15, poly-quaternium-16, polyquaternium-17, polyquaternium-18, polyquaternium-19, polyquaternium-20, polyquaternium-22, polyquaternium-27, polyquaternium-28, poly-<br><br>
quaternium-29, polyquaternium-30, and mixtures there¬of, wherein the compound designation is the name adopted for the compound by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, and found in the CTFA Interna¬tional Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, J. Nikitakis, ed., Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc., Washington, D.C. (1991).<br>
The naturally derived quaternized polymers are especially useful in the composition and method of the present invention. Examples of the quaternized naturally derived polymers include, but are not limited to compounds designed in The CTFA Internation¬al Dictionary as polyquaternium-4, polyquaternium-10, polyquaternium-24, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chlo¬ride, cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein, stearyldimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein, hydroxypropyltrimonium hydrolyzed silk, cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein, lauryldimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein, hydroxypropyltrimonium hydrolyzed soy protein, hydroxypropyltrimonium hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearyldimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed vegetable protein, cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydroxypropyltrimonium hydrolyzed wheat protein, stearyldimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, and mixtures thereof. In addition, the synthetic and the naturally derived quaternized polymers can be used in combination.<br>
An especially useful quaternized polymer is guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, and sold commer¬cially under the tradename HI-CARE 1000, by Rhone-Poulenc, Cranbury, NJ. Other commercially available quaternized guar-based conditioning agents include JAGUAR C-162, JAGUAR C-138, JAGUAR C-145, and JAGUAR<br><br>
C-17, from Rhone-Poulenc, Cranbury, NJ. Useful quaternized cellulosic compounds include, but are not limited to, CELQUAT SC-240 (polyquaternium-10) and CELQUAT L200 (polyquaternium-4), from National Starch and Chemical Corp., Bridgewater, NJ and QUATRISOFT LM-200 (polyquaternium-24) from Amerchol Corp., Edison, NJ.<br>
The polymeric cationic conditioning compound is present in the composition of the present invention in an amount of about 0.01% to about 2%, and prefera¬bly about 0.05% to about 1%, by weight of the composi¬tion. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the cationic polymeric conditioning com¬pound is included in the body wash composition in an amount of about 0.05% to about 0.8% by weight of the composition. When the polymeric cationic conditioning compound is present in an amount above about 2% by weight of the composition, composition esthetics are adversely affected. Therefore, in accordance with an important feature of the present invention, the composition includes 2% or less, and preferably less than 1%, by weight of the polymeric cationic condi¬tioning compound. It has been demonstrated that this amount of polymeric cationic conditioning compound, i.e., about 0.01% to about 2%, and preferably about 0.05% to about 1%, by weight, is sufficiently high to provide a stable composition and to impart condition¬ing properties to the skin.<br>
The cationic polymer is an essential ingre¬dient. Compositions including only a nonsubstantive, nonionic polymer, like hydroxypropylcellulose, as opposed to a quaternized guar gum, do not impart conditioning properties to skin. In contrast, the polymeric cationic conditioning compound included in<br><br>
the present composition is substantive to the skin, and also helps stabilize the composition by effective¬ly preventing interaction between the anionic surfac¬tant and the quaternized phosphate ester, and by pro¬viding a composition that resists phase separation under normal storage conditions. The polymeric cationic conditioning compound, present in a low amount of about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the composition, imparts conditioning properties to the skin.<br>
In addition to the anionic surfactant and the polymeric cationic conditioning compound, the body wash composition also includes a quaternized phosphate ester in an amount of about 0.01% to about 5%, and preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%, by weight of the composition to impart conditioning properties to skin. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the body wash composition contains about 0.1% to about 1% by weight of the quaternized phos¬phate ester.<br>
In general, cationic surfactants are incom¬patible with anionic surfactants. However, the quaternized phosphate esters included in a composition of the present invention minimally interact, if at all, with the anionic surfactant present in the composition. Therefore, the anionic surfactant is available to cleanse the skin and the quaternized phosphate ester is available to condition the skin.<br>
In particular, introducing quaternized phos¬phate ester into the composition: (1) provides an excellent conditioner for treating skin, and (2) sur¬prisingly does not destabilize the composition to such a degree that an adverse interaction between the anionic surfactant and the quaternized phosphate ester<br><br>
occurs. Therefore, neither ingredient precipitation nor decreased product performance is observed. Howev¬er, it has been theorized that introducing the quaternized phosphate ester into the composition does destabilize the composition to a slight, but desir¬able, degree. Accordingly, the quaternized phosphate ester is not completely soluble in the metastable composition, but is available for deposition onto skin upon skin contact, and resists removal from the skin during rinsing of the anionic surfactant from the skin.<br>
Quaternized phosphate esters useful in the present invention have a phosphate ester moiety and a long carbon chain substituent, preferably having a carbonyl moiety, like an amide moiety. These quaternized phosphate esters demonstrate exceptional compatibility with the anionic surfactant when incor¬porated into a body wash composition of the present invention. It has been theorized, but is not relied upon herein, that these quaternized phosphate esters are sufficiently hydrophilic to provide a composition having the desired degree of stability to resist phase separation and yet are available to deposit on the skin.<br>
The quaternized phosphate esters are depict¬ed in general structural formula (I): (Formula Removed) <br><br><br>
wherein R1 is an alkyl chain haivng 8 to 26 carbon atoms, or R1 is an alkamidoalkyl group having the structure<br>
wherein R4 is an aryl group, an alkaryl group, a satu¬rated or unsaturated alkyl group, or a saturated or unsaturated hydroxyalkyl group wherein the alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group has about 7 to about 21 carbon atoms; R5 is hydrogen, or an alkyl or a hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; m is a numeral 1 to about 10; R2 and R3, independently, are an alkyl or a hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; A is a residue of a glycol or a triol having 2 to about 4 carbon atoms, such as, for example, the residue of propylene glycol (i.e., -OCH2CH(OH)CH2- or ethylene glycol -OCH2OH2-) ; Z is an anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, metho-sulfate, ethosulfate, and mixtures thereof; Y is se¬lected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, and an aryl group, either substituted or unsubstituted, wherein the alkyl or the hydroxyalkyl group has 1 to about 22 carbon atoms; and p is a numeral 1 to 3. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the quaternized phosphate ester of structural formula (I) is a quaternized phos¬phate triester that includes an alkamidopropyl moiety, like stearamidopropyl, as the R1 substituent of the compound. For example, the quaternized phosphate ester of general structural formula (I) that includes<br><br>
an alkamidopropyl moiety as the R6 substituent and wherein p is 3.<br>
In addition, alkylhydroxyethyl phosphatidyl PG-imidazolinium chlorides having the structure (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and alkaxnpho phosphatidyl PG-glycinates having the structure (III):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R6 is an alkyl group having about 5 to about 21 carbon atoms and all other terms are as defined above, are usful quaternized phosphate esters.<br>
The alkamidopropyl moiety helps the quaternized phosphate ester impart conditioning properties to the skin. An example of an especially useful quaternized phosphate ester is the triester depicted in structural formula (IV), available commer¬cially under the brandname PHOSPHOLIPID SV, from Mona<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
stearamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride. This particular compound has p equal to 3 and includes the alkyl moiety of stearic acid as a component of the amido substituent R1.<br>
It should be understood that the monophos-phate ester (i.e., p=l) and diphosphate ester (i.e., p=2) of the quaternized phosphate ester illustrated in general structural formula (I) also can be used in the composition of the present invention as long as the basic properties of the body wash composition are not adversely affected. For example, suitable monophos-phate and diphosphate esters of general structural formula (I) include Y as hydrogen, if the composition pH is sufficiently low such that the acid form of the phosphoric acid ester is present, as opposed to the neutralized, salt form; or Y is an alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, or an aryl group.<br>
Various quaternized phosphate esters of structural formula (I) are disclosed in Mayhew et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,209,449, incorporated herein by reference. Other useful quaternized phosphate esters<br>
of structural formula (I) are available commercially from Mona Industries, Paterson, NJ, under the PHOSPHO-LIPID tradename. Useful commercially available prod¬ucts include, but are not limited to, PHOSPHOLIPID SV, PHOSPHOLIPID EFA, PHOSPHOLIPID COM, and PHOSPHOLIPID PTC. These compounds have the CTFA designations stearamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, linoleamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, coco phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, and cocamido-propyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, respective¬ly. Other useful quaternized phosphate esters are borageamidopropyl phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, laurampho phosphatidyl PG-glycinate, and cocohydroxy-ethyl phosphatidyl PG-imidazolinlum chloride.<br>
In addition to the above-described essential ingredients, other common cosmetic components and additives can be included in the composition of the present invention, as long as the basic properties of the body wash composition are not adversely affected. Such optional cosmetic components and additives in¬clude, but are not limited to, oils, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, fragrances, dyes, thickeners, hydrotropes, foam stabilizers, solubil-izers, preservatives, water softening agents, acids, alkalis, buffers, and the like. Likewise, the compo¬sitions can include other emulsifiers, conditioning agents, inorganic salts, humectants, and similar mate¬rials to provide the composition with desirable esthetic or physical properties. These optional components and additives usually are present in weight percentages of 0% to about 5% by weight each, and about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of the composition in total.<br>
To improve the conditioning properties of the body wash composition, the composition optionally can include 0% to about 4%, and preferably 0% to about 3%, of an oil. To achieve the full advantages of the present invention, the composition optionally includes 0% to about 2% by weight of an oil. Above about 4% by weight of an oil, the ability of the body wash compo¬sition to generate foam is adversely affected, which, in turn, adversely affects the esthetics and consumer acceptance of the composition. Persons skilled in the art are capable of selecting a particular oil, and a particular amount of oil, such that the odor of the composition is not adversely affected.<br>
Examples of oils that can be included in the body wash composition include, but are not limited to, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, C30_46 piscine oil, castor oil, chaulmoogra oil, cherry pit oil, coconut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, egg oil, ethiodized oil, grape seed oil, hazel nut oil, hybrid safflower oil, lanolin oil, linseed oil, menhaden oil, mink oil, moringa oil, neatsfoot oil, olive husk oil, olive oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, peach kernel oil, peanut oil, pengawar djambi oil, rapeseed oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, sweet almond oil, walnut oil, wheat germ oil, cod liver oil, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated coco¬nut oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, hydrogenated jojoba oil, hydrogenated menhaden oil, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, white petrolatum, hydrogenated palm oil, hydrogenated peanut oil, hydrogenated shark liver oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, jojoba oil, shark liver oil, synthetic jojoba oil, tall oil, vegetable oil, bay oil, cottonseed oil, PEG-2 castor oil, PEG-3 castor oil, PEG-4 castor oil,<br>
PEG-5 castor oil", PEG-8 castor oil  PEG-9 castor oil, PEG-10 castor oil, isobutylatedlanolin oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition, to improve skin mildness and composition esthetics, the body wash composition op¬tionally can include an amphoteric surfactant in an amount of 0% to about 5% by weight of the composition. Examples of amphoteric surfactants that can be includ¬ed in the body wash composition are, but are not limited to, betaines, hydroxypropylsultaines, amine oxides, n-alkylaminopropionates, n-alkylimino dipropi-onates, phosphobetaines, phosphitaines, imidazolines, and mixtures thereof. Examples of specific amphoteric surfactants include, but are not limited to, cocamido-propyl betaine, lauramidopropyl betaine, coco/oleamidopropyl betaine, coco betaine, oleyl beta¬ine, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, tallowamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, dihydroxyethyl tallow glycinate, cocodimethyIcarboxymethyIbetaine, lauryldimethyl-carboxymethylbetaine, lauryldimethylcarboxyethyIbe¬taine, cetyldimethyIcarboxymethyIbetaine, lauryl-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) carboxymethyIbetaine, oleyldimethyl-gamma-carboxypropyIbetaine, lauryl-bis-(2-hydroxy-propyl)-carboxyethylbetaine, cocodimethyIpropyl-sultaine, stearyldimethylpropylsultaine, laurylbis-(2-hydroxyethyl) propylsultaine, cocoamidodimethylpropyl-sultaine, stearylamidodimethylpropylsultaine, lauryl-amido-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) propylsultaine, cocamido disodium 3-hydroxypropyl phosphobetaine, lauric myris-tic amido disodium 3-hydroxypropyl phosphobetaine, lauric myristic amido glyceryl phosphobetaine, lauric myristic amido carboxy disodium 3-hydroxypropyl phosphobetaine, cocoamido propyl monosodium phos-phitaine, lauric myristic amido propyl monosodium<br>
bilize composition ingredients that are not suffi¬ciently soluble in water, to adjust the viscosity of the composition, or to act as a humectant. Suitable solvents include polyols, like glycerol, glycols, like ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hexylene glycol, or mixtures thereof. The optional nonaqueous solvents should not adversely affect the ability of the composition to cleanse and condition the skin or<br>
phosphitaine, and mixtures thereof. Particularly useful amphoteric surfactants are cocamidopropyl beta-ine, sold commercially under the brandnames TEGO-BETA-INE L10 and TEGO-BETAINE L7, by Goldschmidt Chemical Corp., Hopewell, VA, and cocamidopropyl hydroxy-sultaine, sold commercially under the brand name VARION CAS, Sherex Chemical Co., Dublin, 0. In general, however, any amphoteric surfactant can be included in the composition of the present invention as long as the stability, the conditioning, and the cleansing efficiency of the composition are not ad¬versely affected.<br>
The body wash compositions of the present invention also can include nonionic surfactants to help impart esthetic, physical, or cleansing proper¬ties to the composition. For example, representative nonionic surfactants that can be included in the body wash composition of the present invention include esters of polyols and sugars, fatty acid alkanol-amides, ethoxylated or propoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty alcohols, and the condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain amines or amides. These nonionic surfactants, as well as numerous others not cited herein, are well known in the art and are fully described in the literature, such as McCUTCHEON'S, DETERGENTS AND EMULSIFIERS, 1993 Annuals, published by McCutcheon Division, MC Publishing Co. , Glen Rock, NJ at pages 266-272, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In particular, a nonionic alkanolamide can be included in the composition to provide composition thickening and foam stability. The alkanolamide can be included in an amount of 0% to about 10% by weight of the composition. Examples of alkanolamides in-<br>
elude, but are not limited to, those known in the art of skin care formulations, such- as cocamide MEA, cocamide DBA, soyamide DEA, lauramide DEA, oleamide MIPA, stearamide MEA, myristamide MEA, lauramide MEA, capramide DEA, ricinoleamide DEA, myristamide DEA, stearamide DEA, oleylamide DEA, tallowamide DEA, lauramide MIPA, tallowamide MEA, isostearamide DEA, isostearamide MEA, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The carrier of the body wash compositions of the present invention is predominantly water, but nonaqueous solvents also can be included to help solu-bilize composition ingredients that are not suffi¬ciently soluble in water, to adjust the viscosity of the composition, or to act as a humectant. Suitable solvents include polyols, like glycerol, glycols, like ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hexylene glycol, or mixtures thereof. The optional nonaqueous solvents should not adversely affect the ability of the composition to cleanse and condition the skin or adversely affect consumer appeal of the composition. A nonaqueous solvent typically is present in a body wash composition in an amount of 0% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the body wash composition is a relatively viscous mixture, (i.e., a viscosity of about 2,000 to about 20,000 centipoise at 25°C). A sufficiently viscous body wash composition results from a judicious selection of anionic surfactant, polymeric cationic conditioning compound, quaternized phosphate ester, and desired optional ingredients.<br>
A composition of the present invention often is an emulsion that is stable and that resists phase separation or precipitation of composition ingredients<br>
at a temperature of about 20°C to about 25°C essen¬tially indefinitely. The compositions  -also have demonstrated sufficient stability to resist phase separation or precipitation of ingredients at tempera¬tures normally found in commercial product storage and shipping to remain unaffected for periods of one year or more.<br>
In accordance with the method of the present invention, several body wash compositions were pre¬pared, then used to cleanse the skin, to demonstrate the ability of a single application of a composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant, a polymer¬ic cationic conditioning compound, and quaternized phosphate ester to simultaneously cleanse and impart conditioning properties to the skin. Although the mechanism of interaction between the essential ingre¬dients that provides a relatively stable composition and allows a maximum deposition of conditioning compounds on the skin is not known precisely, it has been theorized that complexes formed during the manufacture of the composition effectively isolate the cationic quaternary ammonium functionalities from contact with the anionic surfactants.<br>
Consequently, because contact between the anionic and cationic components of the composition is effectively prevented, the cationic components are not precipitated from the composition, do not otherwise interact with the anionic surfactant leading to de¬creased effectiveness, and, therefore, are available to effectively deposit onto and condition the skin. Similarly, the anionic surfactant also is available to effectively cleanse the skin. Furthermore, and as will be demonstrated more fully hereinafter, tests have demonstrated that a stable and sufficiently high<br>
foam level is generated during washing, thereby providing enhanced consumer appeal." Sensory tests have demonstrated that excellent conditioning proper¬ties are imparted to the skin.<br>
To demonstrate the new and unexpected results provided by the body wash composition of the present invention, the following Examples 1 through 34 were prepared. The weight percentage listed in each of the following examples represents the actual, or active, amount of each ingredient present in the body wash composition.

The compositions of Examples 1-30 are compo¬sitions of the present invention. The compositions were opaque liquids having a viscosity of about 3,500 to about 15,000 cps (centipoise). The compositions of Examples 1-30 exhibited excellent storage stability, showing no phase separation or ingredient precipita¬tion after storage at about 25°C for several weeks. In contrast, similar compositions that did not include the quaternized phosphate ester demonstrated phase separation after about two weeks storage at 120°F. Accordingly, the quaternized phosphate ester contrib¬utes to the stability of the composition, in addition to imparting conditioning properties to the skin, and, therefore, is an essential ingredient.<br>
Other body wash compositions of the present invention can be prepared by varying the identity of ingredients included in the compositions of Examples 1-30. In particular, other anionic surfactants, such as an alpha-olefin sulfonate or a sarcosinate, can be included in the body wash composition without adverse¬ly affecting the physical properties, esthetic proper¬ties, or the performance properties of the composi¬tion. Likewise, an optional betaine can be substitut¬ed for the optional alkamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and the physical, esthetic, and performance properties are not adversely affected. As stated previously, varying the identity of the optional alkanolamide also had essentially no effect on either the physical or the performance properties of the composition. Important¬ly, the other numbers of the PHOSPHOLIPID series of compounds can be substituted for PHOSPHOLIPID SV without adversely affecting the composition.<br>
Some of the compositions of Examples 1-30 were used to cleanse soiled skin. The compositions effectively generated a sufficient lather, cleansed<br>
the skin and did not dry out the skin. Sensory tests showed that the body wash composition imparted condi¬tioning properties to the skin, and that the skin felt soft, smooth, and moisturized.<br>
Body wash compositions of the present inven¬tion also were subjected to blind tests in which indi¬viduals used a body wash composition, then rated the composition. In some tests, the body wash composi¬tions were compared to OIL OF OLAY MOISTURIZING BODY WASH, available from Proctor and Gamble, Cincinnati, O. In these tests, individuals squeezed a small amount of the body wash composition (i.e., about one teaspoonful) onto a wet applicator, like a pouf or a washcloth, worked the composition into a lather on the skin, then rinsed the skin.<br>
The body wash compositions used in these tests were the compositions of Examples 14 and 31-33, illustrated below:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
OIL OF OLAY contains an anionic surfactant, soybean oil, an amphoteric surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, polyquaternium-10, and other ingredients. OIL OF OLAY does not contain a quaternized phosphate ester.<br>
In particular, the compositions of Examples 14 and 31 were compared to OIL OF OLAY. OIL OF OLAY is considered a benchmark in the industry, and is the product against which persons in the art compare new products. The test was a blind test conducted using about 425 women of ages 18 through 65 who used a body wash in the three months preceding the test.<br>
In general, the composition of Example 31 received a higher rating than OIL OF OLAY or the composition of Example 14. The composition of Example 31 was milder to the skin and imparted a greater moisturizing after-feel to treated skin. The composi¬tion of Example 14 utilized a more aggressive surfac¬tant system, and, therefore, was less mild than the composition of Example 31, but exhibited a superior lathering ability.<br>
Overall, the composition of Example 31 out¬performed OIL OF OLAY with respect to moisturizing and cleansing the skin, skin after-feel, and lathering ability. The individuals in the study rated the composition of Example 31 as having a good moisturiz¬ing ability, such that the skin felt soft, smooth, and moisturized. The conditioning effects also were dura¬ble and long-lasting, thereby obviating the use of a separate skin or body lotion after washing. The composition of Example 31 outperformed OIL OF OLAY with respect to these conditioning attributes, and the composition of Example 14 was comparable to OIL OF OLAY.<br><br>
With respect to cleansing attributes, the compositions of Examples 14 and 31 performed at least as well as OIL OF OLAY, and left the skin both cleansed and moisturized, with a clean, healthy, and refreshed feeling. With respect to a lathering ability, the composition of Example 31 outperformed, and the composition of Example 14 equalled, OIL OF OLAY. The compositions of Examples 14 and 31 each outperformed OIL OF OLAY with respect to composition viscosity and ease of dispensing.<br>
The comparison tests show that the composi¬tions of Examples 14 and 31 are effective body wash compositions which perform at least as well as an industry benchmark with respect to esthetics, consumer appeal, cleansing, and conditioning. It also should be noted that a body wash composition of the present invention imparts excellent skin conditioning proper¬ties even though the composition is free of a silicone or hydrocarbon-based conditioner, which often are included in skin-care compositions to impart condi¬tioning.<br>
The compositions of Examples 32 and 33 also were tested for esthetics, efficacy, and consumer acceptance. In this test, the compositions of Exam¬ples 32 and 33 were tested by 73 women of ages 18 through 54 who used a body wash at least once in the three months prior to the test, have normal skin (i.e., is not very sensitive skin), and have neither recent or current skin rashes nor a chronic skin condition. In these tests, each individual used one composition at a time, and the evaluation of one product was completed before testing of the second product was initiated. The individuals used the product normally and without special instructions, and avoided using other body wash compositions during the<br><br>
test period. The test period was seven days in dura¬tion, and over 90% of the individuals used the body wash composition four or more times during the seven-day period.<br>
The compositions of Examples 32 and 33 each were rated as acceptable with respect to esthetics and lathering ability. The composition of Example 32 had a higher lathering ability. Overall, the individuals in the test rated the composition of Example 33 as equivalent to their usual brand of body wash.<br>
With respect to application and sensory properties, the compositions of Examples 32 and 33 were easy to disperse and spread, generated a large amount of lather, were easily and completely rinsed, and left the skin exceptionally clean, neither oily nor sticky, but smooth, moisturized, refreshed, and nonirritated. The compositions of Examples 32 and 33 sufficiently moisturized the skin such that the use of a lotion or moisturizer after a bath or shower could be eliminated.<br>
The composition of Example 34 also was pre¬pared. The composition of Example 34 was a stable, clear composition, having a viscosity slightly thicker than water. The composition effectively cleaned and conditioned the skin, without additional conditioning agents such as silicone or hydrocarbon-based condi¬tioners.<br>
