				<td>VAPOR PHASE CATALYTIC PROCESS FOR SIMULTANEOUS FURFURAL HYDROGENATION AND CYCLOHEXANOL DEHYDROGENATION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalytic process for simultaneous furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation in vapor phase. Background of the invention<br>
Furfuryl alcohol is an important chemical, mainly used for the production of resins for bonding foundry sand to produce cores and molds for metal casting, corrosion-resistant mortar for installing acid proof brick, laminating resins for corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced equipment, resins for corrosion resistant furan polymer concrete, impregnating solutions and carbon binders. It is also used as nonreactive diluent for epoxy resins, modifier for phenolic and urea resins, oil-well sand consolidation, solvent, production of tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol and other chemical synthesis. It is also an important chemical intermediate for the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C, lubricant, dispersing agent and plastisizer.<br>
Cyclohexanone is an industrially important chemical for the manufacture of caprolactum and adipic acid which are used in producing polyamide fiber in nylon-textiles.<br>
Industrially, furfuryl alcohol is produced by hydrogenation of furfural either in liquid phase or in vapor phase. On the other hand, cyclohexanone is produced majority in vapor phase by dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol. Both the processes employ copper based catalysts.<br>
A number of methods are reported in patent literature on the preparation of catalysts useful for the separate hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol.<br>
Liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural under a pressure of 30 atm. over copper chromite catalysts were disclosed in US patents US 4251396, US4302397. Chinese patent CN1404922 discloses a catalyst comprising of CuO-Cr2O3-NiO for the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural at 35 to 50 atm. and in the temperature range of 453 - 473 K. The vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural was disclosed in US patents US4261905 and US5591873 wherein copper chromite promoted with alkali earth metals and copper deposited on pyrogenic SiO2 respectively were employed as catalysts. In both the cases the reaction was carried out under pressure.<br>
Vapour phase dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to produce cyclohexanone over Cu-Cr based catalysts are disclosed in KR8300880 and US4310703. Processes for making Cu / ZnO or Cu / SiO2 with promoters, suitable for dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol were disclosed in JP2000288395, RU210183, US2004087815, WO09810864. Process for making a multicomponent Cu based cyclohexanol dehydrogenation catalyst was disclosed in CN1056067. A process for making Cu on MgO with promoters for dehydrogenation reaction was disclosed in CN123 5 870. Liquid phase dehydrogenation of cycloheaxanol under pressure was disclosed in Chinese patent CN1381434 and the corresponding method for catalyst making was disclosed in another Chinese patent CN1381435. A process for making a non Cu based catalyst comprising of ZnO - CaO or CaCO3- Cr2O3 is disclosed in US patent 6376422.<br>
A process for making Cu based catalyst suitable for both hydrogenation and a dehydrogenation process separately was disclosed in GB patent 1097819.<br>
The main drawbacks of the furfural hydrogenation processes mentioned above are that they require either to be operated under pressure or to use large amount of hydrogen along with furfural. Even though both furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation processes employ mostly Cu based catalysts, there are no reports on the combined or simultaneous study of these two processes over a single catalyst system. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a catalytic process for simultaneous furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation in vapor phase conditions.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the use of external source of hydrogen is avoided for furfural hydrogenation due to self-generation of hydrogen, thereby saving on costs.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein simultaneous furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation takes place at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the equilibrium barrier for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol can be overcome.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol are conducted<br>
on a copper-magnesia promoted by chromia catalyst prepared by simple techniques like coprecipitation and / or impregnation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process with stable catalytic activity in simultaneous furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a catalytic process for the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanone simultaneously over a copper based catalyst in vapour phase conditions by hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol respectively.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a catalytic process for the simultaneous synthesis of furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanone by the hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol respectively, the process comprising contacting a mixture of furfural and cyclohexanol with a copper based catalyst of the formula xCu-yMgO-zCr2O3, wherein x, y and z are the amounts in terms of weight percent of Cu, MgO and Cr2O3 respectively, under reaction conditions, collecting product streams obtained and separating furfuryl alcohol and cyclohexanone.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the copper based catalyst has a Cu content in the range of 5 to 50 wt% preferably in the range of 10 to 25 wt%. Cr2O3 content in the range of 0 to 15wt%, preferably in the range of 1 to 10 wt%, the balance being MgO.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, co-precipitation method is employed for preparing Cu - MgO and / or Cu - MgO - Cr2O3.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the Cr2O3 is deposited on CuO-MgO by impregnation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the mixture of furfural and cyclohexanol is contacted with the copper based catalyst in vapor phase resulting in the hydrogenation of furfural by hydrogen released due to the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the contacting is carried out in a quartz fixed bed vertical reactor (200 mm long and 8 mm i.d) placed in an electrically heatable cylindrical furnace, with about 1 g of the catalyst packed at the center of the reactor between two plugs of quartz wool being reduced in 6% H2 and balance He flow at 523 K for 4 h followed by lowering the temperature of the reactor to 473 K and replacing the H2/He by pure N2 gas, the mixture of furfural and cyclohexanol<br>
being continuously pumped at a total liquid flow of 1 ml/h into the reactor, the resulting product stream being separated into cyclohexanone and furfuryl alcohol.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the contacting is carried out in the absence of external hydrogen.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the contacting is carried out at a temperature of about 473 K and at atmospheric pressure. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the process of the present invention involving hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol processes over copper based catalysts, it is possible to conduct the two processes simultaneously.<br>
The present invention resides in that no external source of hydrogen is required for the furfural hydrogenation, equilibrium barrier for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol can be overcome and since both the reactions are conducted in vapor phase, separation of catalyst from product mixture is easy and the method of making the catalyst employs simple techniques like co-precipitation and impregnation.<br>
In the process of the present invention the operation of both furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation at atmospheric pressure is disclosed. The equilibrium barrier for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol is overcome. The copper based catalyst is prepared by relatively simple techniques of co-precipitation and/ or impregnation for making of copper based catalyst. The catalytic activity is stable. Scientific Explanation<br>
Even though hydrogenation of furfural to yield furfuryl alcohol appears to be<br>
simple, the nature of catalyst and the reaction conditions play an important role<br>
particularly in getting furfuryl alcohol selectively. Copper based catalysts are suitable<br>
for this reaction. The reaction temperature is critical and if it crosses a particular<br>
temperature (~473 K), ring hydrogenation may also lead to by-products.<br>
C4H4OCHO    +	H2       	*	C4H4OCH2OH		(1)<br>
Thus for getting one mole of furfuryl alcohol, one mole of furfural and one mole of hydrogen molecule are required. Also two moles of reactants yield one mole of product and therefore this reaction is favorable under pressure.<br>
On the other hand, dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone is limited by equilibrium constraints.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It was reported that the equilibrium conversion of direct dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol (Ref: H. A. Cubberley and M. B. Muller, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 63 (1947) 1535) at 473 K was 45.22%.<br>
The advantage of combining these two reactions are, that there is every possibility to overcome the equilibrium limitations in the second reaction and the hydrogen produced in the second reaction is sufficient to carryout the first reaction thereby there is no necessity to pump extra hydrogen externally for the first reaction.<br>
The catalyst employed in this investigation is Cu-MgO-Gr2O3 wherein the Cu content is in the range of 5 to 50 wt.% preferably in the range of 10 to 25 weight percent. Cr2O3 content is 0 to 15 weight percent preferably in the range of 1 to 10 weight percent and the remaining is MgO. Coprecipitation method is employed for preparing Cu - MgO and / or Cu - MgO - Cr2O3 because by this method it is possible to get more CuO-MgO-Cr2O3 interacted species. Cr2O3 can also be deposited on CuO-MgO by impregnation technique.<br>
Vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural was carried out in a quartz fixed bed vertical reactor (200 mm long and 8 mm i.d) placed in an electrically heatable cylindrical furnace. About 1 g of the catalyst packed at the center of the reactor between two plugs of quartz wool has been reduced in 6% H2 (and balance He) flow at 523 K for 4 h followed by lowering the temperature of the reactor to 473 K and replacing the H2/He by pure N2 gas. Mixture of furfural and cyclohexanol (total liquid flow of 1 ml/h) with the help of a syringe pump is continuously pumped. The product mixture is collected in a receiver kept in an ice bath and it is analyzed at regular intervals by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector.<br>
