				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The object of the invention is to provide an improved lightweight container made of a material that may be stamped advantageous1y corrugated cardboard, said container having a means of stacking several containers to form stable piles wherein the various stacked containers remain lodged to one another in a perfectly secure manner.<br>
The proposed container is formed from a single sheet, advantageously of corrugated cardboard, which can be assembled in different ways to provide greater or lesser reinforcement to contain portions of the body, as necessary.<br>
The proposed container serves to pack any type of goods, particularly perishable products such as dry goods and vegetables.<br>
Several container models are known in the market for the storage and transport of perishable goods, generally in the form of open boxes fitted in the upper portion thereof with a transverse projecting lap which extends horizontally towards the center of the container body, the ends of which lap usually lie and rest over the upper edge of the larger sides.<br>
In practical use, these boxes provide deficient results in that the projecting laps lack strength and are thus unable to safely support the perpendicular pressures that develop upon stacking boxes containing heavy goods, giving rise to the crushing and destruction of some of the boxes, particularly at the bottom of the pile or load, making the pile to become offset and causing subsequent destruction of or damage to the products contained.<br>
2<br><br>
This is one of the main drawbacks which the container proposed by the invention intends to solve.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide an improved box especially designed for the storage and transport of fresh fruit, in which the upper edge of the shorter sides or lateral sides and also the end portions of the longer sides form an ample, very strong seat along said upper edge, providing good stability to the load formed by the stacking of several boxes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the formed boxes or containers with a means of support and attachment which enables the stacked boxes to remain stable and resist side pressures which could affect the set of stacked boxes.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide the boxes with side openings which/ on piling the boxes one on top of the other, form ample spaces between every two stacked boxes which serve to ventilate the perishable goods.<br>
An important object of the invention is to provide an improved container formed from a single stamped-out sheet which can be fully assembled in a mounting machine, without resorting to hand labor.<br>
One characteristic of the invention contemplates the lateral sides or shorter sides of the proposed container to be formed by two mutually adjacent partitions forming a double wall between them, with the rows forming the inner cardboard undulations positioned vertically and thus providing said sides with a considerable strength against the vertical pressures developed during the stacking of the boxes.<br>
3<br><br>
Another characteristic of the invention consists in that, when the lateral sides or shorter sides are formed with two mutually adjacent partitions, the upper edge of said lateral sides becomes thicker and thus provides an excellent seat for another container placed on an immediate upper level.<br>
According to a further characteristic of the invention, the inner partition in each lateral side is integral with said lateral side, both parts being hinged to one another along their upper edge to form a horizontal plane on said edge on which to stack another container.<br>
A further characteristic of the invention consists in that the inner partition in each lateral side may be either the sane height or shorter than the lateral side itself, and that it folds into the box to lie adjacent the inner plane or the outer plane of the lateral side, depending on whether it is folded inwards or outwards.<br>
A further characteristic of the model consists in that the lateral sides have respective laps hinged onto both ends thereof, which laps are inserted between two adjacent partitions and thus secure the immediate ends of the front sides or longer sides of the box.<br>
Other objects and characteristics of the proposed container, related to the benefits and economic aspects provided by the invention, shall become apparent further on.<br>
A more complete view of the improved container proposed herein is provided by the following description, illustrated by drawings in which, in a somewhat schematic manner and purely by way of a non-limiting example, the preferred overall and detailed<br>
4<br><br>
concept of the invention is represented in regard to possible practical embodiments.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided :<br>
An improved lightweight container, which is adapted from a preformed base, preferably but not exclusively, from corrugated cardboard which may be assembled in various ways in order to form different types of containers, adapted to the needs generally imposed by the requirements of the products to be packed, wherein its smaller sides possess, joining together at its ends, different extensions which turn 90 deg. in order to make contact on either its interior side or its exterior side with the partition walls that form the larger sides, characterised in that, on the upper edge of the smaller sides and flaps both join together extending with or without interruption along the smaller sides and its extensions to form a small partition that leans and abuts against the interior level of the smaller sides and its extensions forming, in each corner of the container, a transverse sector between the smaller sides and the larger sides, wherein the upper edge of the sector is in line with the upper edge of the smaller sides of the container.<br>
The invention is now described in details with reference to the accompanying drawings;<br>
Figure 1 is a fragmented view showing a corner of the container according to the embodiment, in which the lateral side and its side extensions are composed of two mutually adjacent partitions to form a very robust double wall.<br>
Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1, showing a corner of the container in which the inner lateral side partition fails  to<br>
5<br><br>
reach the bottom and covers only the inner plane of the  lateral side and its side extensions.<br>
Figure 3 is a fragment of the container, showing one of its corners. This drawing reveals that the inner lateral side partition fails to reach the bottom of the box, covering approximately 40% of the main lateral side partition and its side extensions. By reducing the size of this partition, it should be evident that a considerable saving in cardboard follows and that the built container is less expensive, its mechanical strength, however, being reduced.<br>
Figure 4 shows a corner of the box according to a preferred embodiment of the model, in which a considerable strengthened open box is obtained.<br>
Commenting on these drawings, number 1 indicates the bottom of the container, generally shaped in the form of a rectangular parallelopiped onto whose shorter edges are hinged the lateral sides 2 and onto whose longer edges are hinged the longer sides or front sides 11.<br>
According to Figure 1, it is clearly shown that the short sides or lateral sides 2 have a lap 3 hinged onto their upper edge which extends, in either a continuous or discontinuous fashion, throughout the length of the lateral aide and its extensions, the relationship between said lap 3 and lateral side 2 being implemented by two substantially homologous and reciprocally parallel lines 16 and 17 between which a horizontal strip 4 is formed which extends throughout the length of the lateral side 2 and its inner partition 3 to form an ample seat 4<br>
6<br><br>
designed to safely support another container placed on the immediate upper level.<br>
The inner partition 3 of lateral sides 2, which may have the<br>
same height as that of said lateral sides, folds inwards into the<br>
box,  upon 180o  rotation,  to lie in a vertical , plane  lying<br>
parallel to side wall 2, onto the inner face of which it advantageously adheres. The edge of partition 3 abuts against bottom 1 of the container body and provides a double lateral side, partitions 2 and 3 of which, being positioned vertically, provide a substantial strength to the box which enables it to safely withstand the weight of several stacked boxes.<br>
Lateral sides 2 have respective extensions 9 at both ends thereof which rotate 90° to form respective diedrons with the main wall of lateral side 2. Said laps 9 are attached, along their upper portion and by means of two parallel hinge lines 16 and 17 to the extension of inner partition 3, which form sector 10 in this zone. Between both partitions 9 and 10, an upper horizontal strip is formed in alignment with seat 4, with which it cooperates for providing support to another box stacked on top.<br>
Referring once again to Figures 1 and 2, said figures show how the lateral side extensions 9 and the lateral sides themselves form the corners of the box, the upper edge of which corners presents an octagonal elevation 7, 8 which forms an attachment crest between two stacked boxes, the crest of a box on a lower plane becoming inserted in a respective recess 12 formed in the lower edge of the box placed on the immediately upper plane.<br>
7<br><br>
Said Figures 1 and 2 reveal that the inner partition 3 and its extensions 10 join together to form, in eaoh corner an intermediate sector 5 which extends transversely between the longer sides 11 and the lateral sides 2 to form, together with this transverse sector and the walls of the box corner, a triangular prism, the upper edge 6 of which is positioned at the same height as seats 4, thereby cooperating with them to support the box placed on the immediate upper plane.<br>
The double inner partition formed by sectors 3, 10 may be shorter or equal in height to main partition 2 in each lateral side, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, and it is thus evident that in this latter embodiment less material is used for forming the box, although it is equally evident that in the former case the box has greater mechanical strength.<br>
A space is formed between the extensions 9, 10 of the partitions forming each lateral side in which the free end of the corresponding front side 11 is inserted, said front side becoming firmly lodged between said walls 9 and 10, particularly if adhesive is applied.<br>
The lateral sides 2 may be provided with holders, generally formed by a torn cutout 13 in the main wall, into which cutout the fingers of the hand may be inserted for transporting the container.<br>
Figure 4 shows a preferred embodiment of the invention, in which extension 3 of the inner lateral side partition has its end zone 14 rotated outwards from the box, as shown by vector 15, to lie adjacent the exterior plane of front side 11, to which it is bonded with adhesive.<br>
8<br><br>
An important characteristic of the invent ion consists in that the end zones of the longer sides of the box are formed by the three partitions, which lie adjacent to one another, namely: 9, which corresponds to the laps or end extensions of lateral sides 2;<br>
10,	which corresponds to the sector  facing the previous<br>
partition 9; and<br>
11,	which is the end sector of the front side.<br>
These three subsequently adjacent and adhered partitions form a wall composed of three material thicknesses and provide high mechanical strength to the box.<br>
Partitions 9 and 10 are hinged together by two reciprocally parallel lines 16 and 17 between which is formed a horizontal strip positioned at the same level as the edge of seat 4, constituting an extension thereof and providing a greater supporting surface for the box stacked on top.<br>
The described invetion relates specifically to a container formed from a single corrugated cardboard stamped sheet which allows boxes to be assembled in various ways to create different tupes of boxes that respond to the needs generally imposed by the products contained in them.<br>
The nature of the invention being thus conveniently described, as well as the practical manner in which it can be turned into an industrialized reality, it should be stated that the container proposed by the present invention is not strictly limited to the details set forth and in practice is liable to modifications in its detai1s, provided the a1ternatives incorporated do not alter the essence of the container described.<br>
