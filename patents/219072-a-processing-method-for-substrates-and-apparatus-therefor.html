				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for processing,<br>
substrates while controlling the deflection (amount of warping or tilt angle) that occurs in<br>
the substrates during bonding of the individual substrates of, for example, optical disc<br>
substrates so as to attain a desired deflection.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-433599, filed<br>
December 26, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
An optical disc for a DVD is known wherein two individual substrates having a<br>
recording layer, or one individual substrate having a recording layer and one individual<br>
substrate not having a recording layer, or an individual substrate having a recording layer<br>
and a sheet film, or one individual substrate and another individual substrate (here, these<br>
are also referred to as "individual substrates") are bonded together by having interposed a<br>
photo-curable adhesive layer therebetween (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 5-20714).<br>
To read the data recorded on an optical disc or to record the data on an optical<br>
disc, the optical disc is irradiated externally by a laser while the optical disc is rotated,<br>
and the laser irradiates the recording layer by penetrating the transparent substrates of the<br>
optical disc. Because the recording density of the optical disc is extremely high, the<br>
laser must irradiate the recording layer with high precision. If the flatness of the optical<br>
disc is substandard, naturally the flatness of the recording layer will also become<br>
substandard. The laser will not be able to irradiate the recording layer in correct<br>
alignment with a predetermined position, and errors will occur when writing and reading<br>
the data. For this reason, when manufacturing the optical disc, generally there must not<br>
be warping or distortion and that a high degree of flatness can be maintained.<br>
Various inventions have been proposed as methods for decreasing such warping<br>
during the manufacture of an optical disc. In one of these, a method is proposed in<br>
which the heat of the substrates, whose temperature has risen due to the irradiation of the<br>
curing light during the bonding of the individual substrates, is dissipated into the<br>
mounting table on which the substrates is mounted. After the ambient temperature and<br>
the temperature of the substrates have become substantially equal, the substrates are<br>
removed from the mounting table. In this method, this mounting table is cooled by<br>
using a cooling medium such as air or cooled water, and thereby the temperature of this<br>
cooling medium is controlled (for example, refer Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. Hei 10-199053).<br>
Another method has been proposed wherein the mounting table on which the<br>
substrates are mounted is cooled so as to maintain a constant temperature (for example,<br>
refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2003-99985).<br>
In another invention that decreases the warping during the manufacturing of an<br>
optical disc described above have been proposed. The invention includes a method has<br>
been proposed wherein the temperature of at least one of the surfaces of the substrates is<br>
controlled while the photo-curable adhesive layer interposed between the individual<br>
substrates of the optical disc is being cured, and thereby the temperature of both surfaces<br>
is controlled; a method has been proposed wherein the temperature of the substrates is<br>
controlled, and thereby the temperature distribution in both directions of the substrates is<br>
made uniform; and an apparatus has been proposed that provides a temperature control<br>
device that can adjust the surface temperature of a mounting table (for example, refer to<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2000-76710).<br>
However, due to increasing the flatness of the optical disc because of<br>
implementing the methods described above during manufacture of the optical disc, even<br>
if the optical disc possesses the required flatness immediately after its manufacture,<br>
during the subsequent storage, management, and distribution, the optical disc may warp<br>
in a predictable manner. For example, warping may occur due to label printing after<br>
bonding. In such a case, it is necessary to control the warping of the optical disc by<br>
taking into account the warping of such an optical disc during the final usage, and<br>
compensating warping must be intentionally applied to the optical disc so that almost no<br>
warping is present during the final usage.<br>
In consideration of the problems described above, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to control the deflection (tilt angle) of the optical disc during manufacture so as<br>
to attain a target deflection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the processing method and processing apparatus for the substrates of the<br>
present invention, the temperature difference AT°C (= Th - Td) is found between<br>
measured temperature Td of the substrates consisting of a plurality of superposed<br>
individual substrates after interposing an uncured photo-curable adhesive layer<br>
therebetween and the measured temperature Th of a mounting table on which these<br>
substrates are mounted, and at the same time the measured deflection X (deg) of the<br>
substrates is found, and a plurality of these (AT and X) are plotted. The result thereof is<br>
a straight line that represents a linear function, and the slope thereof is the constant of<br>
proportionality M (°C/deg).<br>
Using this constant of proportionality M, when one or both of a mounting table<br>
and the substrates are temperature controlled using the control temperature found by<br>
calculating according to the equation (Th - Td) - Mx(DX or DX") or the equation Th -<br>
Mx(DX or DX"), it is possible to obtain substrates having a desired warping. Xt is the<br>
target deflection for the substrates and X is the measured deflection. In addition,<br>
DX=Xt - X, and DX" is the compensated value obtained by compensating DX. This<br>
compensation is carried out by taking into account the tendency of DX or the like, for<br>
example, whether or not the direction of the increase or decrease is increasing or<br>
decreasing according to a linear, second order, or a higher order curve.<br>
According to the substrate processing method and processing apparatus of the<br>
present invention, it is possible to provide a substrate consisting of bonded individual<br>
substrates having a desired deflection (tilt angle).<br>

substrates, comprising : a step in which substrates before curing are mounted on a<br>
mounting table, said substrates having a plurality of individual substrates and an<br>
uncured photo-curable adhesive layer interposed between these individual<br>
substrates ; a step in which substrates after curing are obtained wherein, while said<br>
substrates before curing are mounted on said mounting table, said individual<br>
substrates are bonded together by photo-curing said adhesive layer by irradiating<br>
said substrates before curing with photo-curing Jight ; and a step in which the<br>
deflection of said substrates after curing is controlled by controlling at least one of<br>
said substrates before curing and said mounting table ; the step in which said<br>
deflection is controlled comprises : a step in which the temperature difference DT<br>
between the temperature Th of said mounting table and the temperature Td of said<br>
substrates before curing is found ; a step in which the deflection difference DX<br>
between the deflection X of said substrates after curing and the target deflection<br>
setting value Xt is found ; a step in which the temperature Tc is found by Tc = DT -<br>
M x DX by using the constant of proportionality M determined by the correlation<br>
between said temperature difference DT and said deflection X ; and a step in which<br>
at least one of said substrates before curing and said mounting table are<br>
temperature controlled according to said temperature Tc such that Tc = Th - Td.<br>

comprising : a mounting table for mounting substrates before curing, said<br>
substrates consisting of pair of individual substrates having a photo-curable<br>
adhesive layer interposed therebetween ; an irradiating device that irradiates said<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
First, the new insight on which the present invention is based will be explained<br>
before explaining a first embodiment of the preferred configuration for implementing the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the inventors of the present invention (a) measured the<br>
temperature Td of the optical disc substrates (below, referred to as the "substrates")<br>
before being mounted on the mounting table, where the substrates consisting of a<br>
plurality of individual substrates superposed after interposing an uncured photo-curable<br>
adhesive layer therebetween. In addition, the inventors (b) measured the temperature<br>
Th of the mounting table on which the substrates are mounted before irradiating a curing<br>
light such as UV light. As shown in Fig. 1, the inventors (c) found the temperature<br>
difference DT (°C) (=Th-Td) between the temperature Td and the temperature Th, and (d)<br>
found the deflection X (deg) of the substrates D after curing when the temperature has<br>
substantially fallen to room temperature after curing the photo-curable adhesive layer by<br>
irradiating a curing light on the substrates before curing. Note that, as shown in Fig. 12,<br>
the deflection (tilt angle) denotes the angle 0 formed by the normal that is perpendicular<br>
to the recording surface of the substrates and the axis of the optical system.<br>
The basic insight was attained that, for a plurality of substrates, as shown in Fig.<br>
2, the results of (e) plotting of the deflection X (deg) and the plurality of temperature<br>
differences AT (°C) show that the relationship between the deflection X and the<br>
temperature difference AT fits a linear function M", which is a substantially proportional<br>
relationship. The slope of this linear function M" serves as the constant of<br>
proportionality M (°C/deg). Based on many experimental results, a section of the linear<br>
function M" changes depending on the condition of the warping of the bonded individual<br>
substrates, but the slope, that is, the constant of proportionality M, is substantially<br>
unchanged. Therefore, it was confirmed that by using the constant of proportionality M<br>
and the linear function M", when controlling the difference between the temperature of a<br>
mounting table and temperature of the substrates, the deflection (tilt angle) of the<br>
substrates can attain a desired value by using this temperature difference. In particular,<br>
by using a constant of proportionality M within a range from 15 (°C/deg) to 40 (°C/deg),<br>
that is, 15 (°C/deg) 
a desired value in a short period of time.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
The basic embodiment of the processing method and processing apparatus for<br>
the substrates according to the present invention will be explained with reference to Fig.<br>
3 to Fig. 7. Fig. 3 is a drawing for explaining the basic conception of the present<br>
invention. Fig. 4 is a drawing showing the optical disc bonding device 100 according to<br>
an embodiment for explaining the control of the deflection X of the substrates, and Fig. 5<br>
shows a schematic drawing of the mechanism that controls the deflection of the bonded<br>
substrates which, in the present embodiment, are substrates consisting of a plurality of<br>
individual substrates that have been bonded together. Fig. 6 is a drawing for explaining<br>
basic arrangement of a preferable example of the temperature control apparatus that<br>
controls the warping of the substrates, and Fig. 7 is a drawing that shows the block<br>
structure of the temperature control apparatus that controls the deflection of the<br>
substrates.<br>
The basic conception of the present invention will be explained with reference to<br>
Fig. 3. Assuming that the deflection of a substrates is XI when the measured<br>
temperature of the mounting table is Thl and the measured temperature of the substrates<br>
is Td1, then Thl - Td1 = DT1, and as shown in Fig. 3, the point (XI, DT1) on the linear<br>
function M" is shown by Ml.<br>
In order for the deflection X1 of the substrates to be made equal to a desired<br>
target deflection Xt, as shown by the dashed line, it is sufficient that the temperature Th2<br>
of the mounting table and the temperature Td2 of the substrates satisfy the temperature<br>
difference DT2 = (Th2 - Td2), which corresponds to point M2 on the linear function M"<br>
at the target deflection Xt of the substrates. At this time, the difference (DT1 - DT2)<br>
between DT1 and DT2 becomes M (Xt - X1). Expressed as an equation, this becomes<br>
(DT1 - DT2) = M (Xt - X1). From this equation, it can finally be deduced that (Th2 -<br>
Td2) = (Thl - Td1) - M (Xt - X1). (Thl - Td1) denotes the temperature difference DT1,<br>
which is obtained by subtracting the measured temperature Tdl of the substrates from the<br>
measured temperature Th1 of the mounting table, and X1 denotes the deflection of the<br>
substrates after curing at that time, and thus each of these are a known numerical value at<br>
the point in time that they are measured.<br>
Therefore, it is understood that it is sufficient that either one or both of the<br>
temperature Th2 of the mounting table and the temperature Td2 of the substrates are<br>
controlled so as to satisfy the principal equation (Th2 - Td2) = (Th1 - Td1) - M (Xt - X1).<br>
When expressed by the temperature Th of the mounting table and the temperature Td of<br>
the substrates, this function can be simplified to (Th - Td) = Tc = DT - M x (DX or DX").<br>
Below, this function will serve as the principal function. Here, AT denotes the<br>
temperature difference between the temperature Th of a mounting table and the<br>
temperature Td of the substrates measured when finding the point Ml, and AX denotes<br>
the difference between the desired target deflection Xt and the measured deflection X.<br>
As described above, DX" is the compensated value obtained by compensating DX. This<br>
compensation takes into account whether or not the tendency of DX, for example, the<br>
direction of increase or decrease, increases or decreases as a linear, a second order, or a<br>
higher order curve. In embodiment 1, only the temperature of the mounting table is<br>
controlled.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, two individual substrates (not illustrated) are superposed<br>
having a photo-curable adhesive layer interposed therebetween, and by eliminating the<br>
excess photo-curable adhesive by a spinner apparatus 1, the superposed substrates d<br>
having uncured adhesive interposed therebetween are obtained. While the substrates d<br>
are being transferred to the turntable 3 from the spinner apparatus 1, the temperature Td<br>
of the substrates is measured by a general method in which a substrate temperature<br>
measuring device such as an infrared light temperature sensor (not illustrated) is used.<br>
The substrates d are mounted on the mounting table 5a among the plurality of mounting<br>
tables 5a to 5j, which are disposed in sequence at fixed intervals on the turn table 3.<br>
The turntable 3 rotates intermittently in the direction of the arrow (clock) at a constant<br>
speed.<br>
The measurement of the temperature Th of each of the mounting tables when<br>
located at the position of mounting table 5a is carried out by using a general method,<br>
such as an infrared light temperature sensor (not illustrated), or a mounting table<br>
temperature measuring device such as a thermocouple (not illustrated). The substrates d<br>
are mounted on the mounting table 5a, and the individual substrate among the substrates<br>
d that is on the side in contact with the mounting table 5a expands or contracts due to the<br>
temperature Th of the mounting table. While the adhesive between the individual<br>
substrates is uncured, it is possible to change the shape of the individual substrates on the<br>
side in contact with the mounting table 5 a comparatively freely. Note that here 5 a to 5j<br>
are considered to be the mounting tables positioned at mounting position.<br>
At the mounting tables 5a to 5j, a cooling and heating mechanism 7 that serves<br>
as the temperature control device of the mounting tables 5 is provided. At the mounting<br>
positions 5h, 5i, 5j, 5a, and 5b in the temperature adjustment area 6, adjustment of the<br>
temperature of a mounting table is carried out so as to adjust the difference between the<br>
temperature of the mounting table and the temperature of the substrates. Next, the<br>
temperature adjustment of a mounting table will be explained.<br>
The uncured photo-curable adhesive layer of the substrates d is irradiated by a<br>
curing light such as ultraviolet light from a curing light irradiating apparatus 9 and<br>
photo-cured to make the bonded substrates D, in which the individual substrates are<br>
completely bonded. When the temperature has fallen to room temperature, the<br>
necessary tests are carried out on substrates D by a testing apparatus 11. One among the<br>
tests is the measurement of the deflection X of the substrate D.<br>
An example of the basic preferable arrangement of the temperature control<br>
apparatus 13 will be explained with reference to Fig. 6. The temperature control<br>
apparatus 13 calculates the target deflection Xt of the input substrates D and the<br>
deflection X of the substrates D found by carrying out the warping tests, and finds the<br>
deflection difference DX, which is the difference therebetween. This deflection<br>
difference DX is compensated by the compensating device 13k. A compensating device<br>
13k that employs a widely used PID control method is explained as a preferable example.<br>
This PID control method outputs a compensated value DX". The DX" is a value<br>
compensated by a device k1 that carries out proportional control action, in which an<br>
output signal is output that is proportional to the deviation between the target value and<br>
the measured value; a device k2 that carries out integral control action, in which an<br>
output signal is output that is proportional to the time integral of the deviation; and a<br>
device k3 that carries out derivative control action, in which an output signal is output<br>
that is proportional to the rate of change of the deviation as a function of time, depending<br>
on whether the tendency of the deflection difference DX described above is, for example,<br>
is a linear function that is a function of time, a second order function that is a function of<br>
time, or another function. The calculation of Tc = DT - MxDX" described above is<br>
carried out by the calculating unit 13m of the temperature control apparatus 13, and<br>
temperature adjustment of the cooling and heating mechanism 7 is carried out such that<br>
the deflection X of the substrates smoothly and quickly approaches the target deflection<br>
Xt.<br>
Note that in the above explanation, the compensation device 13k compensated<br>
the deflection difference AX by PID control, but other suitable control methods besides<br>
PID control can be used.<br>
A detailed example of the temperature control apparatus 13 will be explained<br>
with reference to Fig. 7. The deflection X that has been input into the temperature<br>
control apparatus 13 is input into a first deflection calculating unit 13B via a gate C1 of a<br>
gate unit 13A, and calculated. The first deflection calculating unit 13B finds the pure<br>
average value of the deflection X of a predetermined number of substrates D or the<br>
average value of the deflection X within an allowable range (below, these are referred to<br>
as the average deflection Xa).<br>
In addition, a desired target deflection Xt is input into the deflection setting unit<br>
13C of the temperature control apparatus 13 as a reference value, and set. This desired<br>
target deflection Xt is determined taking into consideration that this deflection in the<br>
finished disc is zero or lies within an allowable range. Next, in the deflection<br>
calculation and determination unit 13D of the temperature control apparatus 13, a<br>
calculation is carried out to find the deflection difference AX, which is the difference<br>
between the average deflection Xa described above and the desired target deflection Xt<br>
described above. Preferably, this deflection difference AX is compensated by the<br>
compensation device as described above, but because compensation is not always<br>
necessary, the compensation device has been omitted in the temperature compensation<br>
device 13 shown in Fig- 7. However, of course during calculation of the temperature Tc,<br>
this compensated value DX" can be used instead of the deflection difference DX.<br>
In the proportionality constant setting unit 13E of this temperature control<br>
apparatus 13, the constant of proportionality M found as described above is registered.<br>
It should be possible to select the constant of proportionality M within a range of 15<br>
(°C/deg) = M = 40 (°C/deg) or should be set to a suitable value within the range of 15<br>
(°C/deg) = M = 40 (°C/deg), for example, the substantially intermediate values 27 or 28<br>
(°C/deg).<br>
When describing the constant of proportionality M, in the case of a constant of<br>
proportionality M within the range 15 (°C/deg) = M = 40 (°C/deg), the deflection X of<br>
the substrates D can be controlled so as to attain a target deflection Xt in a short period of<br>
time. However, the constant of proportionality M is a constant that converts the<br>
deflection X of the substrates D to a temperature, and when this constant of<br>
proportionality M deviates from the optimal value by becoming smaller, the response of<br>
the convergence to the target deflection Xt deteriorates. Contrariwise, when the<br>
constant of proportionality becomes large, the response of the convergence to this target<br>
deflection Xt becomes rapid, but oscillation occurs easily, and convergence takes time.<br>
In the present embodiment, in the case that the constant of proportionality M is smaller<br>
than 15 (°C/deg), the deflection X of the substrates D slowly approaches the target<br>
deflection Xt by using temperature control, and thus a long time is required to reach the<br>
target deflection Xt, making this constant of proportionality difficult to use in an actual<br>
bonding line. In addition, in the case that the constant of proportionality M is larger<br>
than 40 (°C/deg), the deflection X of the substrates D approaches the target deflection Xt<br>
in a short time, but the target deflection Xt oscillates vertically off the center, a long time<br>
is required to converge on the target deflection Xt, making this constant of<br>
proportionality difficult to use in an actual bonding line.<br>
At the same time, in the temperature difference calculation unit 13F of the<br>
temperature control apparatus 13, the measured value Th of the mounting table 5a and<br>
the measured temperature Td of the substrates d before being mounted on the mounting<br>
table are input, the temperature difference calculating unit 13F carries out the calculation<br>
of (Th - Td), and the signal for the temperature difference AT, which is the result of this<br>
calculation, is output. The temperature control calculating unit 13G that finds the<br>
temperature Tc, which changes the deflection X so as to attain the target deflection Xt,<br>
carries out the calculation of (DT -Mx DX) by the function described above by using the<br>
constant of proportionality M from the proportionality constant setting unit 13E, the<br>
temperature difference DX from the deflection calculation and determination unit 13D,<br>
and the temperature difference DT from the temperature difference calculating unit 13F,<br>
and finds the temperature Tc, which is the difference between the temperature Th of a<br>
mounting table and the temperature Td of the substrates d. A temperature command<br>
directing whether to raise, lower, or maintain a temperature at a certain °C depending on<br>
this temperature Tc is sent to the cooling and heating mechanism 7. This temperature<br>
command directs how many °C to change the temperature command currently provided.<br>
The cooling and heating mechanism 7 provides an electricity-temperature<br>
conversion element (not illustrated) such as a Peltier element on the surface of each of<br>
the mounting tables under the substrates, and the temperature adjustment can be carried<br>
out by using the electrical signal. The temperature adjustment of a mounting table 5<br>
shown in Fig. 5 is carried out according to the temperature control amount Tc described<br>
above in the temperature adjustment area 6, which includes the mounting positions 5h, 5i,<br>
5j, 5a, and 5b, as shown in Fig. 4. The reason that five mounting tables are present in<br>
the temperature adjustment area 6 is due to taking into consideration the speed of the<br>
temperature change of a mounting table 5 and the time required for a mounting table 5 to<br>
transit the temperature adjustment area 6. In the case that the time-lag of the<br>
temperature adjustment of a mounting table 5 is a minor problem, one or two mounting<br>
tables may be present in the temperature adjustment area 6.<br>
By adjusting the temperature of a mounting table in this manner, the control of<br>
the temperature difference DT between the temperature Th of a mounting table 5 and the<br>
temperature Td of the substrates d is carried out and thereby the deflection of the<br>
substrates D is controlled. The relationship between the warping of the substrates D<br>
and the temperature is that when the temperature of the substrates d rises, the warping of<br>
the substrates D becomes concave, and when the temperature of the substrates d falls, the<br>
warping of the substrates D becomes convex. That is, when the temperature of the<br>
substrates d changes, the deflection and direction change.<br>
The operation will be explained with reference again to Fig. 4. A temperature<br>
adjustment area 10 is provided downstream of the curing light irradiating apparatus 9 for<br>
making the temperature of the substrates D equal to room temperature. This<br>
temperature adjustment area 10 is also provided in other generally used bonding<br>
apparatuses for individual substrates, and will not be explained in detail. However, in a<br>
cooling and heating mechanism that uses an electricity-heat conversion element or the<br>
like, the cooling time per unit temperature requires about 2.5 more time than the heating<br>
time, and thus the method of cooling adjusts the temperature difference DT so as to attain<br>
a predetermined value in a short period of time such that the temperature of the substrates<br>
D in this temperature adjustment area 10 attains room temperature or a temperature that<br>
is somewhat lower than the control temperature of the cooling and heating mechanism 7<br>
at that time.<br>
The substrates D are discharged before being conveyed to the temperature<br>
adjustment area 10 or discharged at the mounting position as shown in the figure and<br>
naturally cooled at a cooling position (not illustrated). While the temperature has fallen<br>
to room temperature, the substrates D are tested by the testing apparatus 11. The data<br>
for the deflection X found by the testing apparatus 11 is sent to the temperature control<br>
apparatus 13, as described above, and an operation such as that described above is<br>
repeated. The term "room temperature" denotes the ambient temperature of the<br>
substrates D, and indicates the temperature of the room when the substrates D are in the<br>
atmosphere of a room or indicates the temperature of the atmosphere when the substrates<br>
D are surrounded by the atmosphere in an apparatus.<br>
According to embodiment 1, the deflection of the bonded substrates D after<br>
adhesive curing can attain a desired value by controlling the temperature of a mounting<br>
table 5 as described above, adjusting the difference between the temperature of a<br>
mounting table 5 and the temperature of the substrates d, and controlling the deflection of<br>
the superposed substrates d by this adjusted temperature difference.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
A second embodiment will be explained with reference to Fig. 5 to Fig. 1 IB.<br>
Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 have been described above, and their explanation will be omitted.<br>
Fig. 8 is a drawing showing a flowchart for explaining the control of the deflection X of<br>
substrates. Fig. 9 is a drawing showing the relationship between the change in warping<br>
of the substrates and time. Fig. 10 is a drawing sowing the optical disc bonding<br>
apparatus 200 according to another embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 11A and<br>
11B show an example of the mounting table which can be used in the optical disc<br>
bonding apparatus shown in Figs. 4 and 10. The steps S1 to S9 described below<br>
correspond to steps S1 to S9 in the flowchart in Fig. 8.<br>
In activating the bonding line for the substrates, first in step S1 the target<br>
deflection Xt, which is the warping target value for the substrates D, is input into the<br>
temperature control apparatus 13, and set in the deflection setting unit 13C. At the<br>
same time, the initial temperature of a mounting table 5 is set in the temperature control<br>
unit 13H. Past values close to room temperature, for example, are used as this initial<br>
temperature.<br>
In step S2, the cooling and heating mechanism 7 is controlled so as to maintain<br>
this initial temperature, and then the temperature of a mounting table 5 has stabilized at<br>
the initial temperature, the bonding line for the substrates is activated as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
This stand-by time is, for example, about 10 to 30 seconds. After passage of the<br>
stand-by time, as described in embodiment 1, the substrates d superposed at the spinner<br>
apparatus 1 are held by suction to a single transfer arm 15 that carries out a left to right<br>
turning operation, and then they are conveyed from the spinner apparatus 1 to a mounting<br>
table 5. In the case that it is necessary to measure the temperature Td of the substrates d,<br>
the temperature Td of the substrates d is measured during the conveyance of the<br>
substrates d by a substrate temperature measuring device 17 such as an infrared<br>
temperature sensor provided on the transfer arm 15.<br>
A mounting table 5 has the structure shown, for example, in Fig. 11A and Fig.<br>
11B. A duct or passage 5Y zigzags through the interior of a mounting table 5, and<br>
substantially uniformly cools or heats a mounting table 5. A temperature adjusting<br>
medium, such as air or water, that adjusts the temperature flows through the duct 5 Y due<br>
to a temperature adjusting unit (not illustrated) in the cooling and heating mechanism 7.<br>
Although not illustrated, a mounting table temperature measuring device such as an<br>
infrared sensor or thermocouple is provided on the bottom surface side of a mounting<br>
table 5 to measure the temperature thereof.<br>
The substrates d mounted on a mounting table 5 are conveyed up to the curing<br>
light irradiation apparatus 9 by a conveyance mechanism 19, such as a 1-axis robot,<br>
along with the mounting table 5. The adhesive between the individual substrates in the<br>
pair of substrates d is cured by irradiation of a curing light such as ultraviolet light, and<br>
the substrates d become bonded substrates D. The substrates D are returned to the<br>
position shown in the figure along with the mounting table 5 by the conveyance<br>
mechanism 19. At the position shown in the drawing, the substrates D are conveyed to<br>
a static eliminating mechanism 23 by a second transfer arm 21. The static eliminating<br>
mechanism 23 blows air having positive or negative ions onto the substrates D, the static<br>
electricity on the substrates D is neutralized, and at the same time, cooling is carried out.<br>
Subsequently, the substrates D are conveyed to the testing apparatus 11 by the third<br>
transfer arm 25.<br>
In step S3, number n of substrates D is tested by the testing apparatus 11, and in<br>
sequence, the results are input into the first deflection calculation unit 13B after passing<br>
through the gate Cl of the gate unit 13A shown in Fig. 7. Temperature control is<br>
carried out at the initial temperature described above until the deflection X of the n<br>
substrates D has been measured. When the initial temperature is set in the temperature<br>
control unit 13H, a signal (not illustrated) is sent to the deflection calculation and<br>
determination unit 13D, this deflection calculation and determination unit 13D receives<br>
this signal, and closes the gate Cl of the gate unit 13A. At this time, the gate C2 is<br>
opened. That is, gates C1 and C2 operate at opposite phases.<br>
In step S4, the first deflection calculation unit 13B finds the average deflection<br>
Xa of the deflection X of the n substrates D sent through the gate C1. This average<br>
deflection Xa is the average value of the deflection X within a predetermined allowable<br>
range, and a deflection X that falls outside this range is ignored.<br>
In step S5, the average deflection Xa of the deflection X of the n substrates D is<br>
sent to the deflection calculation and determination unit 13D, and the deflection<br>
calculation and determination unit 13D determines whether or not the average deflection<br>
Xa falls within the target range of the target deflection Xt ±a. a is selected from among<br>
values equal to or less than 0.1°, and preferably equal to or less then 0.05°.<br>
In step S6, if the average deflection Xa does not fall within the target range of<br>
the target deflection Xt ±a, then the deflection calculation and determination unit 13D<br>
sends the deflection difference DX, which is the difference between the average<br>
deflection Xa and the target deflection Xt, to the temperature control amount calculation<br>
unit 13G, and the temperature control amount calculation unit 13G carries out the<br>
calculation according to the function described above (DT - M x DX or the compensated<br>
value DX" thereof) from the deflection difference DX (or the compensated value DX"<br>
thereof), the constant of proportionality M (°C/deg) set by the proportionality constant<br>
setting device 13E, the measured temperature Th of the input mounting table, and the<br>
measured temperature Td of the substrates d, calculates the temperature Tc, and sends a<br>
signal corresponding to the temperature Tc to the temperature control unit 13H.<br>
The temperature Tc indicates the current temperature control amount, in this<br>
case, how much the initial temperature described above is changed. The temperature<br>
control unit 13H controls the cooling and heating mechanism 7 using a command<br>
temperature that combines the initial temperature that has been set and the temperature<br>
Tc. When the temperature Tc is positive, the set initial temperature is increased, and<br>
when the temperature Tc is negative, the set initial temperature is decreased.<br>
In step S7, a mounting table 5 is controlled so as to attain this command<br>
temperature until the temperature of the mounting table 5 stabilizes at this command<br>
temperature, without changing the control. When stabilized at the command<br>
temperature, the control operation described above is again carried out.<br>
If the newly found average deflection Xa does not fall within the target range of<br>
the target deflection Xt ±a, the temperature control calculating unit 13G again carries out<br>
the calculation according to the equation described above (DT - M x DX or the<br>
compensated value DX" thereof) from the deflection difference DX, which is the<br>
difference between the newly found average deflection Xa and the target deflection Xt,<br>
the constant of proportionality M set by the proportionality constant setting unit 13E, the<br>
measured temperature Th of the input mounting table 5, and the measured temperature<br>
Td of the substrates d, calculates the temperature Tc, and controls the cooling and heating<br>
mechanism 7 using the new command temperature, which is a combination of the<br>
command temperature described above and the temperature Tc. This control is<br>
maintained, and when the mounting table stabilizes at this new command temperature,<br>
control operation is again carried out as described above, and a new average deflection<br>
Xa is calculated again.<br>
In step S8, if the newly calculated average deflection Xa falls within a target<br>
range (Xt - a = Xa = Xt + a) of the target deflection Xt ±a, the deflection calculation and<br>
determination unit 13D does not output a signal to the temperature control amount<br>
calculating unit 13G. Therefore, because the temperature control amount calculation<br>
unit 13G does not send the temperature Tc to the temperature control unit 13H, the<br>
temperature control amount calculation unit 13G maintains the new command<br>
temperature, and as long as the new average deflection Xa falls within the target range of<br>
the target deflection Xt ±a, the cooling and heating mechanism 7 is controlled using the<br>
new command temperature.<br>
In step S9, in addition, when Xt - a = Xa = Xt + a, the deflection calculation<br>
and determination unit 13D switches from gate Cl in the gate unit 13A to gate C2, closes<br>
gate C2, and the second deflection calculation unit 131 finds the moving average value<br>
Xa by calculating the deflection X of the n substrates sent through gate C2. Here, the<br>
moving average value denotes the average value Xa of the deflection X, which is in a<br>
predetermined allowable range, among the deflections of the most recent n substrates<br>
after curing.<br>
While the average value Xa of this deflection X is Xt - a = Xa = Xt + a, the<br>
command temperature is not changed, and the previous command temperature is<br>
maintained.<br>
However, when the calculation and determination unit 13D determines that the<br>
most recent moving average deflection Xa does not fall within the target range of the<br>
target deflection Xt ±a, the processing returns to the operation of steps S6 ? S7 ? S3 in<br>
the flowchart shown in Fig. 8, and then the operations of steps S4, S5 and after are<br>
carried out.<br>
In this manner, the temperature control of a mounting table 5 is carried out, and<br>
the difference between the temperature Th of a mounting table 5 and the temperature Td<br>
of the substrates d, that is, the temperature control amount Tc, is found, the temperature<br>
of only a mounting table 5 is controlled, and the temperature difference Tc between a<br>
mounting table 5 and the substrates d is made equal to Tc. Thereby, the deflection of<br>
the superposed substrates d is controlled, and it is possible to make the deflection of the<br>
bonded substrates D after curing of the adhesive equal to a desired value.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the state in which the deflection X of the substrates d falls within<br>
the target range of the target deflection Xt ±a as a function of time, and approaches the<br>
set value Xt. S1 to S9 in the figure correspond to steps S1 to S9 in the flowchart shown<br>
in Fig. 8. Steps S3 and S7 in the figure shows the stand-by time, and the arrows at step<br>
S6 show that the deflection (tilt angle) X has largely changed in the direction of the target<br>
deflection Xt.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
In an actual bonding line for individual substrates, the individual substrates are<br>
conveyed to the bonding environment, the bonding requires a predetermined amount of<br>
time or greater, and the temperature of the bonding environment is maintained<br>
substantially constant (for example, 25°C). Thus, frequently the temperature of the<br>
substrates d that are superposed with the adhesive interposed therebetween can be<br>
considered to be constant.<br>
Therefore, in this case, in the principal equation (Th2 - Td2) = (Th1 - Td1) - M<br>
(Xt - X1), the temperature of the substrates d is considered to be Td2 = Td1, and thus the<br>
equation can be rewritten as Th2 = Thl - M (Xt - XI) = Thl - M • DX. From this<br>
equation, simply by subtracting M • AX from the temperature Thl of a mounting table<br>
when finding the constant of proportionality M, it is possible to find the temperature Th2<br>
of a mounting table. In addition, by using a compensated value AX", which is the<br>
deflection difference AX that has been compensated as described above, it is possible to<br>
find the temperature Th2 of a mounting table simply by subtracting M • DX" from the<br>
temperature Th1 of a mounting table.<br>
As described above, the present inventors confirmed that a constant of<br>
proportionality M is preferably a numerical value within a range from 15 (°C/deg) to 40<br>
(°C/deg), and if a constant of proportionality M having a numerical value within this<br>
range is used, then the temperature Th1 of the mounting table is known when finding the<br>
constant of proportionality M. Thus, in the actual bonding line, both the temperature<br>
measurement of a mounting table and a temperature measurement of the substrates<br>
becomes unnecessary, and simply by measuring the deflection X of the substrates D and<br>
carrying out the calculation according to the above equation, the temperature of a<br>
mounting table can be controlled so as to attain any temperature.<br>
In this embodiment, for example, the cooling capacity of the cooling and heating<br>
mechanism 7 is 2 sec/°C, the constant of proportionality M is 28.5°C/deg, and the<br>
measured value X of the substrates D is 0.2 deg smaller than the setting value Xt. In<br>
this case, from the equation Th2 = Th1 - M (Xt - X1), Th2 = Th1 - 5.7°C. Therefore, it<br>
is understood that Th2 should be about 6°C lower than the temperature Thl found when<br>
calculating the constant of proportionality M. For example, if Thl is 26°C, then Th2<br>
should be about 20°C. Because the cooling capacity of the cooling and heating<br>
mechanism 7 shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 10 is 2 sec/°C, the time at this point is about 12<br>
seconds, the temperature of a mounting table will be substantially stabilized after the<br>
passage of about 12 seconds, and thus the bonding line can be operated. In this case,<br>
the stand-by time is approximately 12 seconds.<br>
In addition, conventionally, when curing the adhesive in the curing light<br>
irradiation system, there has been the problem that the temperature of a mounting table<br>
increases due to the curing heat generated while the adhesive layer is being cured.<br>
However, in the case that the embodiment 3 is realized by the apparatus shown in Fig. 10,<br>
Fig. 11 A, and Fig. 11B, temperature control of a mounting table is carried out even<br>
during the irradiation by the curing light. Thus, there are the effects that it is possible to<br>
limit increases in the temperature of a mounting table, make the temperature fluctuation<br>
of a mounting table small, and at the same time, make temperature increases in the<br>
substrates small.<br>
In the above explanation, the case that the temperature of the substrates d was<br>
considered to be Td2 = Td1, but there are also cases in which the temperature Th of the<br>
mounting table can also be considered to be Th2 = Th1. In this case, in the principal<br>
equation described above, (Th2 - Td2) = (Th1 - Td1) - M (Xt - X1), the temperature of a<br>
mounting table can be considered to be Th2 = Thl, and thus this equation can be<br>
rewritten as Td2 = Tdl + M (Xt - X1) = Td1 + M • DX. From this equation, simply by<br>
adding M • DX to the temperature Tdl of the substrates when finding the constant of<br>
proportionality M, the temperature Td2 of the substrates can be found. In addition,<br>
when the compensated value DX", which is the compensated deflection difference DX as<br>
described above, simply by adding M • DX" to the temperature Tdl of the substrates, it is<br>
possible to find a more preferable temperature Td2 for the substrates.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
In the embodiment described above, a configuration was described in which the<br>
constant of proportionality M was appropriately selected from constants of<br>
proportionality in a range from 15 (°C/deg) to 40 (°C/deg), that is 15 (°C/deg) = M = 40<br>
(°C/deg). However, as described in Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2, there cases in<br>
which, in an actual production line (not illustrated), the temperature sensor that measures<br>
the temperature Th of a mounting table and a temperature sensor that measures the<br>
temperature Td of the substrates are provided and the measured temperature data thereof<br>
is obtained. Thus, a calculating device that calculates the constant of proportionality M<br>
is provided in the processing apparatus of the substrates, and a constant of proportionality<br>
M suitable for the processing conditions at this time can be found.<br>
In this embodiment, the temperature difference AT between the temperature Td<br>
of the substrates and the temperature of Th of a mounting table is found, and at the same<br>
time, the deflection X of the substrates D after irradiation by curing light is measured.<br>
The constant of proportionality M is found from the slope of the straight line found from<br>
a combination (X, DT) of at least two points of the temperature difference AT and the<br>
deflection X, a combination (X, DT) of each of the substrates is added as available, and<br>
the constant of proportionality M is updated. For example, if the straight line (a straight<br>
line identical to the straight line represented by the linear function M" described above)<br>
as described above is found from twenty combinations (X, DT) of the temperature<br>
difference DT and the deflection X and the constant of proportionality M is found from<br>
the slope of this line, when the twenty-fifth temperature difference DT and deflection X<br>
are found, the constant of proportionality M is found from the twenty points of the sixth<br>
through twenty-fifth temperature difference DT and deflection X. When the<br>
twenty-sixth temperature difference DT and deflection X are found, the constant of<br>
proportionality M is found from the twenty points between the seventh and the<br>
twenty-sixth temperature difference DT and deflection T.<br>
In this manner, while finding the constant of proportionality M by taking into<br>
account the combinations (X, DT) of the temperature difference DT and the deflection X<br>
for each of the substrates, the temperature Tc is found by carrying out the calculation of<br>
(DT - M x DX or the compensated value DX" thereof) by using the found constant of<br>
proportionality M, as explained in embodiments 1 and 2 or embodiment 3. Thus, one or<br>
both of the temperature Th of a mounting table and the temperature Td of the substrates<br>
can be controlled such that Tc = Th - Td.<br>
According to the present invention, the appropriate control temperature is found<br>
while finding sequentially the constant of proportionality M by the measured temperature<br>
data for each of the mounting tables and each of the substrates and the measured<br>
deflection data for each of the substrates. Thus, depending on the conditions at the time,<br>
it is possible to automatically select a suitable constant of proportionality M from a range<br>
of 15 (°C/deg) = M = 40 (°C/deg).<br>
Embodiment 5<br>
In embodiment 4, the constant of proportionality M (°C/deg) is updated for each<br>
of the mounting tables and each of the substrates, but in this embodiment, the measured<br>
temperature of a predetermined number (for example, 10) substrates is extracted each<br>
time the number of the processed substrates reaches a predetermined number, for<br>
example, 500 or 1000, and thereby the average temperature Td1 thereof is found.<br>
Similarly, the measured temperature of the substrates for the next predetermined number<br>
(for example, 10) is extracted, and the average temperature Td2 thereof is found. At the<br>
same time, the measured temperature of a mounting table on which the predetermined<br>
number of substrates has been mounted is extracted, and the average temperature Th1<br>
thereof is found. Similarly, the measured temperature of the mounting tables on which<br>
the next predetermined number of substrates has been mounted is extracted, and the<br>
average temperature Th2 thereof is found.<br>
In addition, for the deflection of the substrates, the deflection data for a<br>
predetermined number of substrates after curing, which are the object for extraction of<br>
the measured temperature, is extracted, the pure average thereof or the average of the<br>
deflections within an allowable range is found, and the result serves as the deflection X<br>
of the substrates. As described above, the deflection difference AX that expresses the<br>
difference between the deflection X and the target deflection Xt, is found. Or, as<br>
described above, the compensated value DX", which is the compensated value of the<br>
deflection difference DX, is found.<br>
As explained in embodiment 4, the constant of proportionality M at the time can<br>
be found from the principal equation described above. In this embodiment, the constant<br>
of proportionality M is found for each of the predetermined number of substrates, and<br>
until the constant of proportionality M for the next predetermined number is found, this<br>
found constant of proportionality M is used in order to carry out and temperature control<br>
of either or both of each of the mounting tables or each of the substrates. Thus, like<br>
embodiment 4, it is possible to select automatically the constant of proportionality<br>
suitable for the various conditions at the time from a range of 15 (°C/deg) = M = 40<br>
(°C/deg).<br>
In embodiment 4 and embodiment 5, like embodiment 3, the temperature of the<br>
substrates is substantially room temperature, and if the room temperature is constant, the<br>
temperature of the substrates is also constant. Thus, it is possible to measure only the<br>
temperature of the mounting table to carry out control the temperature of a mounting<br>
table according to temperature Tc. There is not need to measure the temperature of the<br>
substrates. Thereby, the control can be simplified.<br>
Embodiment 6<br>
In the above embodiments, control is carried out by using the constant of<br>
proportionality M (°C/deg), finding the temperature Tc, which controls the warping of<br>
the substrates D according to Tc = DT - M x (DX or DX"), so as to approach and match<br>
the target deflection Xt, and finding the moderating temperature difference for the<br>
temperature difference between the present temperature of the a mounting table and the<br>
temperature of the substrates. However, control can be carried out by finding the<br>
temperature difference using the linear function M" shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.<br>
In this case, as is clear from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the linear function M" has a<br>
slope of M when Th - Td is DT, and thus can be expressed by the equation DT = MX + a.<br>
The constant value a is the value of DT (ordinate) when the deflection X (abscissa) of the<br>
substrates is zero, and is determined by the combination of the warping of two bonded<br>
individual substrates, such as the deflection X of individual substrates to be bonded and<br>
the direction of warping or the like.<br>
By inputting beforehand the linear function M" (DT = MX + a) into a personal<br>
computer, microcontroller, or the like, or by inputting a plurality of linear functions<br>
having predetermined constant values al, a2, a3, ..., an that correspond to a variety of<br>
conditions, it is possible to select either depending on the conditions. By inputting the<br>
target setting value Xt into this linear function, it is possible to control one or both of a<br>
mounting table or the substrates so that the sought temperature difference DT between a<br>
mounting table and the substrates can be found automatically and the temperature<br>
difference between the mounting table and the substrates becomes DT.<br>
In this embodiment, it is always possible to carry out control by using an<br>
optimal linear function M" even if the deflection of the substrates fluctuates due to the<br>
occurrence of variation in the deflection of individual substrates caused by variation in<br>
moulding and sputter technologies, fluctuations in the ambient temperature or the like.<br>
For example, when control is carried out using DT1=MxXt + a1,...(1) based on the<br>
linear function M" in order to make the deflection of the substrates equal to a target<br>
deflection Xt and the deflection X is controlled so as to attain the target deflection Xt and<br>
be constant, in the case that the deflection X deviates from the set range due to some<br>
cause (the segment a changes but the slope of the linear function M" does not), the<br>
following operation is carried out by a deflection determining device (not illustrated)<br>
outputting a signal.<br>
First, the current deflection X of the measured substrates is substituted into the<br>
linear function M", and the temperature difference DT2 {= M x X + a2,..., (2)} between the<br>
present temperature of a mounting table and the temperature of the substrates is calculated.<br>
