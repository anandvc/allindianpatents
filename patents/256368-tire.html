TIRE<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The natural rubber used in the invention of the instant application is not from<br>
India, and the source of origin of the natural rubber used in the invention is "Thailand".<br>
The present invention relates to a tire satisfying both of the reduction of rolling<br>
resistance and the improvement of strength of the tire.<br>
The low fuel cost of a car has been conventionally carried out by the reduction<br>
of the rolling resistance of a tire (improvement of the rolling resistance performance).<br>
Request for the low fuel cost of a car has been recently strengthened increasingly and<br>
more superior low heat build-up property is requested. For example, as a method of<br>
reducing the rolling resistance of a tire, there is carried out a method of reducing the<br>
loss tangent tan δ of tread, sidewall, breaker rubber and clinch in order in which rubbers<br>
used are much.<br>
As trial of reducing the rolling resistance of tire member, for example, it is<br>
described in the patent literature 1 that a butadiene rubber modified with tin is used for a<br>
rubber composition for sidewall as a rubber component, and it is described in the patent<br>
literature 2 that a styrene-butadiene rubber modified with solution polymerization<br>
and/or a butadiene rubber modified with tin is used as the rubber component of a rubber<br>
composition for covering carcass.<br>
As a method of reducing the loss tangent tan δ of a sidewall rubber, there are<br>
mentioned a method of reducing the compounding amount of filler, a method of<br>
enlarging the particle diameter of carbon black and a method of compounding a<br>
modified butadiene rubber, but elongation at break is lowered. Further, as a method<br>
of reducing the loss tangent tan δ of a clinch rubber, there are also mentioned a<br><br>
method of reducing the compounding amount of filler, a method of<br>
enlarging the particle diameter of carbon black and a method of<br>
compounding a modified butadiene rubber, but elongation at break is<br>
also lowered; therefore it provokes damage by stone curb and damage<br>
at assembling rim and further, causes the friction of rim chafing.<br>
Namely, it is difficult to satisfy both of the reduction of<br>
rolling resistance and the improvement of elongation at break and<br>
there was no tire having low rolling resistance and superior strength.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The tire of the present invention has sidewall comprising (A)<br>
a rubber composition for sidewall having specified composition and<br>
property, case covering cord with (B) a rubber composition for covering<br>
case cord having specified composition and property, and clinch<br>
including (C) a rubber composition for clinch having specified<br>
composition and property. Respective portion is illustrated below.<br>
(A) Rubber composition for sidewall<br>
The rubber composition for sidewall (A) of the present<br>
invention includes a specific rubber component (A1) and filler (A2).<br>
The rubber component (A1) includes a natural rubber (NR)<br>
and/or an isoprene rubber (IR) (a1) as well as a modified butadiene<br>
rubber (modified BR) (a2).<br>
NR is not specifically limited, those generally used in the<br>
rubber industry can be used and RSS#3 and TSR20 are specifically<br>
used.<br>
Further, IR is not specifically limited and those<br>
conventionally used in the tire industry can be used.<br>
The content of NR and/or IR (a1) in the rubber component<br>
(A1) is at least 35 % by mass and preferably at least 40 % by mass<br>
because elongation at break is superior. Further, the content of NR<br>
and/or IR (a1) in the rubber component (A1) is at most 65 % by mass<br>
and preferably at most 60 % by mass because the adequate amount of<br>
the modified BR superior in crack resistance is compounded.<br><br>
The modified BR modifies chemically the terminal of a<br>
butadiene rubber and enhances bonding force between polymer and<br>
carbon black, and tin-modified BR and S-modified BR can be<br>
preferably exemplified.<br>
As for the rubber composition for sidewall among these<br>
modified BR's, there is preferably tin-modified BR that is obtained by<br>
polymerizing 1,3-butadiene with a lithium initiator and then adding a<br>
tin compound and in which the terminal of the modified BR molecule is<br>
bonded with a tin-carbon bond.<br>
The lithium initiator includes lithium compounds such as<br>
an alkyl lithium, aryl lithium, vinyl lithium, organic tin lithium and<br>
organic nitrogen lithium compound, and lithium metal. The modified<br>
BR with high vinyl and low cis content can be prepared by using the<br>
lithium initiator as the initiator of the modified BR.<br>
The tin compound includes tin tetrachloride, butyltin<br>
trichloride, dibutyltin dichloride, dioctyltin dichloride, tributyltin<br>
chloride, triphenyltin chloride, diphenyldibutyltin, triphenyltin<br>
ethoxide, diphenyldimethyltin, ditolyltin chloride, diphenyltin<br>
dioctanoate, divinyldiethyltin, tetrabenzyltin, dibutyltin di-stearate,<br>
tetraallyltin and p-tributyltin styrene. These tin compounds may be<br>
used alone and at least two kinds may be used in combination.<br>
The content of a tin atom in the modified BR is preferably at<br>
least 50 ppm and more preferably at least 60 ppm. When the content<br>
of a tin atom is less than 50 ppm, effect for promoting the dispersion of<br>
carbon black in the modified BR tends to be little and tan δ tends to be<br>
increased. Further, the content of a tin atom is preferably at most<br>
3000 ppm, more preferably at most 2500 ppm and further preferably<br><br>
at most 250 ppm. When the content of a tin atom exceeds 3000 ppm,<br>
the cohesiveness of a kneaded article tends to be inferior and edges<br>
tend to be not arranged; therefore the extrusion property of the<br>
kneaded article tends to be deteriorated.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the<br>
tin-modified BR is preferably at most 2 and more preferably at most<br>
1.5. When Mw/Mn of the tin-modified BR exceeds 2, the dispersibility<br>
of carbon black is deteriorated and tan δ tends to be increased.<br>
The amount of a vinyl bond of the tin-modified BR is<br>
preferably at least 5 % by mass and more preferably at least 7 % by<br>
mass. When the amount of a vinyl bond of the tin-modified BR is less<br>
than 5 % by mass, it tends to be difficult to polymerize (produce) the<br>
modified BR. Further, the amount of a vinyl bond is preferably at<br>
most 50 % by mass and more preferably at most 20 % by mass. When<br>
the amount of a vinyl bond of the tin-modified BR exceeds 50 % by<br>
mass, the dispersibility of carbon black tends to be deteriorated and<br>
tensile strength tends to be lowered.<br>
As the tin-modified BR satisfying condition above, for<br>
example, BR1250H manufactured by Zeon Corporation is mentioned.<br>
The S-modified butadiene rubber is a product obtained by<br>
modifying polybutadiene and is different from a modified<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber (modified SBR) obtained by modifying a<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber described later.<br>
S-modified BR includes, for example, S-modified BR<br>
manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.<br>
The content of the modified BR (a2) in the rubber<br>
component (A1) is at least 15 % by mass and preferably at least 20 %<br><br>
by mass because tan δ can be reduced. The content of the modified<br>
BR (a2) in the rubber component (A1) is at most 55 % by mass and<br>
preferably at most 50 % by mass because heat build-up at extrusion<br>
process can be suppressed and effect of reducing tan δ is saturated<br>
even if excessive amount is compounded.<br>
Further, as other rubber (a3), a butadiene including<br>
syndiotactic crystals (VCR), an epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) and a<br>
modified SBR may be compounded in the rubber component (A1).<br>
Herein, syndiotactic crystals mean, for example,<br>
syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene fiber. Crosslink density can be<br>
lessened by including VCR even if same complex elastic modulus E* is<br>
obtained, and strength, durability, abrasion resistance and crack<br>
growth property can be improved.<br>
The content of the syndiotactic crystals of VCR is preferably<br>
1 to 25 % by mass and more preferably 5 to 20 % by mass. When it is<br>
less than 1 % by mass, syndiotactic component is too little and<br>
adequate rigidity does not tend to be obtained, and when it exceeds<br>
25 % by mass, durability is lowered because the syndiotactic<br>
component forms aggregation lump in polybutadiene. The VCR<br>
includes VCR-303, 412 and 617 manufactured by Ube Industries Ltd.<br>
When VCR is compounded as other rubber (a3), at most<br>
50 % by mass and further, at most 45 % by mass are preferable in the<br>
rubber component (A1) because heat build-up property is good.<br>
Further, at least 10 % by mass and further, at least 15 % by mass are<br>
preferable because abrasion resistance and E* is good.<br>
Commercially available ENR may be used as ENR and NR<br>
may be epoxidized to be used. A process of epoxidizing NR is not<br><br>
specifically limited and it can be carried out using processes such as<br>
chlorohydrin process, direct oxidation process, hydrogen peroxide<br>
process, alkylhydroperoxide process and peracid process. As the<br>
peracid process, for example, a process of reacting organic peracid<br>
such as peracetic acid and performic acid with NR is mentioned.<br>
The epoxidization ratio of ENR is preferably at least 10 % by<br>
mol and more preferably at least 20 % by mol. When the<br>
epoxidization ratio of ENR is less than 10 % by mol, reversion tends to<br>
be great and crack growth resistance tends to be lowered. Further,<br>
the epoxidization ratio of ENR is preferably at most 60 % by mol and<br>
more preferably 55 % by mol. When the epoxidization ratio of ENR<br>
exceeds 60 % by mol, processability such as mixed compound and<br>
sheet processability tends to be lowered.<br>
ENR satisfying the condition is not specifically limited, but<br>
includes specifically ENR 25 and ENR 50 (Kumplan Guthrie Berhad).<br>
ENR may be used alone and at least two kinds may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
When ENR is compounded as other rubber (a3) in the<br>
rubber component (A1), its content is preferably at least 15 % by mass<br>
and more preferably at least 20 % by mass because crack growth<br>
resistance is superior. Further, the content of ENR in the rubber<br>
component (A1) is at most 50 % by mass and preferably at most 45 %<br>
by mass because elongation at break is superior.<br>
Example of the filler (A2) includes carbon black, silica and<br>
calcium carbonate and these may be used alone and at least two kinds<br>
may be used in combination. Among them, carbon black is preferably<br>
used because elongation at break, ozone resistance and weatherability<br><br>
is superior.<br>
The compounding amount of the filler (A2) is at least 20<br>
parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component<br>
(A1), and preferably at least 23 parts by mass because elongation at<br>
break, sheet processability and extrusion processability are superior.<br>
Further, the compounding amount of the filler (A2) is at most 45 parts<br>
by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component (A1),<br>
and preferably at most 40 parts by mass because tan δ can be reduced.<br>
The nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA) of<br>
carbon black is preferably at least 20 m2/g and more preferably at<br>
least 30 m2/g because elongation at break and processability are<br>
superior. As carbon black, N2SA is preferably less than 45 m2/g and<br>
more preferably less than 42 m2/g because tan δ can be reduced.<br>
Preferable carbon black includes, for example, N550 and N660.<br>
Silica may be used in combination with carbon black. In<br>
case of use in combination, when silica is about 25 to 50 parts by<br>
mass based on 100 parts by mass of carbon black, processability to a<br>
sheet is improved and elongation at break is further improved.<br>
The N2SA of silica is preferably at least 40 m2/g and more<br>
preferably at least 50 m2/g because elongation at break is superior.<br>
Further, the N2SA of silica is preferably at most 200 m2/g and more<br>
preferably at most 180 m2/g because effect of suppressing tan δ (low<br>
heat build-up) is superior.<br>
Silica includes specifically Ultrasil VN3 available from<br>
Degussa Corporation, Z115GR available from Rhodia S. A. and Ultrasil<br>
360 available from Degussa Corporation. When silica is used, a silane<br>
coupling agent may be used in combination. The silane coupling<br><br>
agent is described later.<br>
The rubber composition for sidewall (A) in the present<br>
invention can suitably compound compounding agents generally used<br>
in the tire industry such as, for example, a vulcanizing agent such as<br>
sulfur, a vulcanization accelerator, zinc oxide, an antioxidant, aromatic<br>
oil, stearic acid and wax, in addition to the rubber component (A1) and<br>
filler (A2).<br>
Complex elastic modulus E* measured at 70°C is preferably<br>
at least 2.0 MPa, more preferably at least 2.5 MPa and further<br>
preferably at least 2.7 MPa because the rubber composition for<br>
sidewall (A) of the present invention is superior in elongation at break.<br>
Further, complex elastic modulus E* measured at 70°C is preferably at<br>
most 3.5 MPa and more preferably at most 3.3 MPa because the<br>
rubber composition for sidewall (A) is easily bent and low in rolling<br>
resistance when a load is applied.<br>
The lower the tan δ measured at 70°C is, the more<br>
preferable the rubber composition (A) for sidewall of the present<br>
invention is, but the lower limit is usually 0.03. Further, loss tangent<br>
tan δ measured at 70°C is preferably less than 0.12 and more<br>
preferably at most 0.11 because the rubber composition for sidewall (A)<br>
is low in tan δ and superior in low heat build-up and low rolling<br>
resistance.<br>
Herein, the complex elastic modulus E* and loss tangent<br>
tan 6 measured at 70°C mean complex elastic modulus (E*) and loss<br>
tangent (tan δ) measured under the conditions of temperature of 70°C,<br>
frequency of 10 Hz, initial strain of 10 % and dynamic strain of 2 %<br>
with a viscoelastic spectrometer.<br><br>
(B) Rubber composition for covering case cord<br>
The rubber composition for covering case cord (B) used in<br>
the present invention includes the specific rubber component (B1) and<br>
filler (B2).<br>
The rubber component (B1) includes (b1) a natural rubber<br>
(NR) and/or an isoprene rubber (IR), (b2) at least one diene rubber<br>
selected from a group consisting of a modified styrene-butadiene<br>
rubber (modified SBR), a modified butadiene rubber (modified BR) and<br>
an epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) and (b3) other rubber if necessary.<br>
NR and IR (b1) are not specifically limited and NR and IR<br>
illustrated in the rubber composition for sidewall (A) can be preferably<br>
used.<br>
The content of NR and/or IR (b1) in the rubber component<br>
(B1) is at least 50 % by mass and preferably at least 55 % by mass<br>
because elongation at break is superior. Further, it is at most 80 %<br>
by mass and preferably at most 75 % by mass because the adequate<br>
amount of the diene rubber (b2) superior in durability at high<br>
temperature (150 to 250°C) and reversion property is compounded.<br>
The diene rubber (b2) is at least one selected from a group<br>
consisting of a modified SBR, a modified BR and ENR.<br>
The modified SBR is a polymer in which a modifying group<br>
having strong binding force with silica or carbon black is introduced in<br>
the polymer terminal of a styrene-butadiene polymer or in polymer<br>
chain.<br>
As the modified SBR, those having a few amounts of bonded<br>
styrene such as HPR340 manufactured by JSR Co., Ltd. are preferable.<br>
The amount of bonded styrene of the modified SBR is<br><br>
preferably at least 5 % by mass and more preferably at least 7 % by<br>
mass because reversion property at rubber compounding is superior.<br>
Further, the amount of bonded styrene of the modified SBR is<br>
preferably at most 30 % by mass and more preferably at most 20 % by<br>
mass because low heat build-up is superior.<br>
The modified SBR includes a modified SBR by emulsion<br>
polymerization (modified E-SBR) and a modified SBR by solution<br>
polymerization (modified S-SBR), but the modified S-SBR is preferable<br>
because low fuel cost can be improved by strengthening bond between<br>
silica and polymer chain and reducing tan δ.<br>
As the modified SBR, those coupled with tin and silicon are<br>
preferably used. As the coupling process of the modified SBR, there is<br>
mentioned a method of reacting alkali metal (such as Li) and alkali<br>
earth metal (such as Mg) at the molecular chain terminal of the<br>
modified SBR with tin halides and silicon halides.<br>
The modified SBR is a (co)polymer obtained by<br>
(co)polymerizing conjugated diolefin alone or conjugated diolefin with<br>
an aromatic vinyl compound and has preferably a primary amino<br>
group and an alkoxysilyl group.<br>
The primary amino group may be bonded with either of<br>
terminal at polymerization initiation, terminal at polymerization<br>
termination, polymer main chain and side chain, but it is preferably<br>
introduced in terminal at polymerization initiation or terminal at<br>
polymerization termination because energy loss from polymer terminal<br>
is suppressed and hysteresis loss property is improved.<br>
The mass average molecular weight (Mw) of the modified<br>

million because adequate fracture property is obtained. Further, the<br>
Mw of the modified SBR is preferably at most 2 million and more<br>
preferably at most 1.8 million because the viscosity of a rubber can be<br>

When the modified BR is used as the diene rubber (b2), its<br>

resistance is superior and tan δ can be reduced. Further, it is<br>

mass because reversion property and elongation at break are superior.<br>

composition for sidewall (A) can be preferably used.<br>
When ENR is compounded, its content in the rubber<br>
component (B1) is at least 20 % by mass and preferably at least 30 %<br>
by mass because reversion property is superior. Further, it is at most<br>
45 % by mass and preferably at most 40 % by mass because<br>
elongation at break is superior.<br>
Among these diene rubbers (b2), the modified SBR is<br><br>
preferable in particular because heat build-up and elongation at break<br>
are good.<br>
The content of the diene rubbers (b2) in the rubber<br>
component (B1) is 20 to 45 % by mass in the total of the contents of<br>
the diene rubbers (b2) in these rubber components (B1).<br>
Example of the filler (B2) includes carbon black, silica and<br>
calcium carbonate and these may be used alone or at least two kinds<br>
may be used in combination. Among them, silica and/or carbon black<br>
are preferably used because elongation at break and tan δ can be<br>

As silica and carbon black compounded in the rubber<br>

because heat build-up and elongation at break are good. The mass<br>
ratio of silica to carbon black is preferably 10/1 to 1/1 and further,<br>
5/1 to 2/1 because elongation at break (durability) is good.<br>

those have been conventionally compounded in a rubber composition<br>

3-triethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazoltetrasulfide, 3-triethoxysilylpropyl<br>
methacrylate monosulfide and 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate<br>
monosulfide;	mercapto	series	such	as<br>
3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
2-mercaptoethyltrimethoxysilane and 2-mercaptoethyltriethoxysilane;<br><br>
vinyl series such as vinyl triethoxysilane and vinyl trimethoxysilane;<br>
amino	series	such	as	3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>

used alone or at least two kinds may be used in combination. Among<br>
them,	bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide	and<br>

When the silane coupling agent is compounded, the content<br>
of the silane coupling agent is preferably at least 6 parts by mass,<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of silica, and more preferably at least 8<br>
parts by mass because processability and heat build-up are superior.<br>
Further, the content of the silane coupling agent is preferably at most<br>
12 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of silica, and more<br>
preferably at most 10 parts by mass because when the silane coupling<br>
agent is excessively compounded, excessive coupling agent releases<br>
sulfur and the rubber is excessively cured; therefore elongation at<br>
break is lowered and cost is heightened.<br>
The rubber composition for covering case cord (B) of the<br><br>
present invention can suitably compound compounding agents<br>
generally used in the tire industry such as, for example, a vulcanizing<br>
agent such as sulfur, a vulcanization accelerator, zinc oxide, an<br>
antioxidant, aromatic oil and stearic acid, in addition to the rubber<br>
component (B1) and filler (B2).<br>
Complex elastic modulus E* measured at 70°C is preferably<br>
at least 2.0 MPa, more preferably at least 2.5 MPa and further<br>
preferably at least 2.7 MPa because the rubber composition for<br>
covering case cord (B) of the present invention is superior in elongation<br>
at break. Further, complex elastic modulus E* measured at 70°C is<br>
preferably at most 3.5 MPa and more preferably at most 3.2 MPa<br>
because the rubber composition for covering case cord (B) is superior<br>
in rolling resistance.<br>
The lower the tan δ measured at 70°C is, the more<br>
preferable the rubber composition for covering case cord (B) of the<br>
present invention is, but the lower limit is usually 0.03. Further, loss<br>
tangent tan δ measured at 70°C is preferably less than 0.12 and more<br>
preferably at most 0.11 because the rubber composition for covering<br>
case cord (B) is superior in rolling resistance.<br>
The case cord in the present invention may be either of case<br>
steel cord or case fiber cord.<br>
The case steel cord means steel cord covered with the<br>
rubber composition for covering case (B), using the rubber composition<br>
for covering case cord (B) as a rubber for covering case cord.<br>
Further, the case fiber cord means fiber cord covered with<br>
the rubber composition for covering case (B), using the rubber<br>
composition for covering case cord (B) as a rubber for covering case.<br><br>
Herein, the fiber cord is obtained by raw materials such as polyester,<br>
nylon, rayon, polyethylene terephthalate and aramid. Among them,<br>
polyester is preferably used as raw material because thermal stability<br>
is superior and further, cost is low.<br>
(C) Rubber composition for clinch<br>
The rubber composition for clinch (C) in the present<br>
invention includes NR and/or IR (c1), modified BR (c2), rubber<br>
component (C1) including other rubber (c3) and filler (C2).<br>
Clinch in the present invention means the whole portion<br>
brought in contact with the rim of a tire and includes clinch apex,<br>
rubber chafer and bead toe.<br>
NR and IR (c1) are not specifically limited and NR and IR<br>
illustrated in the rubber composition for sidewall (A) can be preferably<br>
used.<br>
The content of NR and/or IR (c1) in the rubber component<br>
(C1) is at least 25 % by mass, preferably at least 30 % by mass and<br>
more preferably at least 32 % by mass because elongation at break is<br>
superior. Further, it is at most 70 % by mass, preferably at most<br>
65 % by mass and more preferably at most 50 % by mass because the<br>
adequate amount of the modified BR (c2) superior in durability at high<br>
temperature (150 to 250°C) and reversion property is compounded.<br>
As the modified BR (c2), the modified BR illustrated in the<br>
rubber composition for sidewall (A) can be preferably used. As the<br>
modified BR (c2), tin-modified BR is preferable in particular because<br>
heat build-up is good.<br>
The content of the modified BR (c2) in the rubber<br>
component (C1) is preferably at least 15 % by mass, more preferably at<br><br>
least 35 % by mass and further preferably at least 40 % by mass<br>
because crack growth resistance is superior and tan δ can be reduced.<br>
Further, it is preferably at most 80 % by mass and more preferably at<br>
most 75 % by mass and further preferably at most 70 % by mass<br>
because reversion property and elongation at break are superior.<br>
The other rubber (c3) may be compounded till 55 % by mass<br>
in the rubber component (C1), but as the other rubber, butadiene<br>
including syndiotactic crystals (VCR) can be used. Among them, VCR<br>
is preferable. As the VCR, VCR illustrated in the rubber composition<br>
for sidewall (A) can be preferably used.<br>
When VCR is compounded as the other rubber (c3), at most<br>
55 % by mass and at most 50 % by mass are preferable because heat<br>
build-up is good in the rubber component (C1). Further, at least 10 %<br>
by mass and at least 15 % by mass are preferable because abrasion<br>
resistance and E* are good.<br>
Example of the filler (C2) includes carbon black, silica and<br>
calcium carbonate and these may be used alone or at least two kinds<br>
may be used in combination. Among them, silica and/or carbon black<br>
are preferably used because elongation at break and tan δ can be<br>
reduced.<br>
As silica compounded in the rubber composition for clinch<br>
(C), silica illustrated in the rubber composition for sidewall (A) can be<br>
preferably used. Silica has action of retarding vulcanization speed<br>
and can adjust vulcanization speed by using in combination a<br>
vulcanization accelerator described later (for example, TACKIROL<br>
V200). When silica is used, a silane coupling agent may be optionally<br>
used in combination. As the silane coupling agent, those illustrated<br><br>
in the rubber composition for covering case cord (B) can be used.<br>
Further, the nitrogen adsorption specific surface area (N2SA)<br>
of carbon black is preferably at least 45 m2/g and more preferably at<br>
least 50 m2/g because abrasion resistance is superior. Further, N2SA<br>
is preferably at most 90 m2/g and more preferably at most 85 m2/g<br>
because low heat build-up can be attained. Preferable carbon black<br>
includes, for example, N330 and N351.<br>
The compounding amount of the filler (C2) is at least 35<br>
parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component<br>
(C1), and preferably at least 37 parts by mass because abrasion<br>
resistance is superior. Further, it is at most 80 parts by mass, based<br>
on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component (C1), and preferably at<br>
most 70 parts by mass because tan δ can be reduced.<br>
In the rubber composition for clinch (C), silica and carbon<br>
black are preferably used in combination as the filler (C2) because both<br>
of heat build-up and elongation at break are satisfied. The mass ratio<br>
of silica to carbon black is 0.10 to 0.30 and further, 0.15 to 0.27<br>
because heat build-up, elongation at break and abrasion resistance are<br>
good.<br>
The rubber composition for clinch (C) in the present<br>
invention can suitably compound compounding agents generally used<br>
in the tire industry such as, for example, a vulcanizing agent such as<br>
sulfur, a hybrid curing agent, a vulcanization accelerator, a<br>
vulcanization accelerating aid, zinc oxide, an antioxidant, aromatic oil<br>
and stearic acid, in addition to the rubber component (C1) and filler<br>
(C2).<br>
As the vulcanization accelerating aid, a modified resorcinol<br><br>
condensate (or a modified cresol condensate) can be used and when<br>
same complex elastic modulus E* is provided, the modified resorcinol<br>
condensate is preferable because Hs (=E*) can be heightened without<br>
increasing crosslinking points by a crosslinking agent (sulfur) and<br>
elongation at break EB is superior. Further, the modified resorcinol<br>
condensate is granule and reinforcing effect is also exhibited.<br>
The modified resorcinol condensate includes, for example, a<br>
compound represented by the following formula:<br><br>
(Wherein n is integer and n is preferably an integer of 1 to 3. Further,<br>
R is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbons.) (For example, TACKIROL<br>
V200 manufactured by Taoka Chemical Co., Ltd.), a<br>
resorcinol-alkylphenol-formalin copolymer (SUMIKANOL 620<br>
manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) and a<br>
resorcinol-formaldehyde condensate (Penacolite Resin B-18-S and B-20<br>
manufactured by INDSPEC Chemical Corporation).<br>
Particularly preferable modified resorcinol condensate<br>
includes SUMIKANOL 620 and modified cresol condensate includes<br>
SUMIKANOL 610.<br>
The content of the modified resorcinol condensate is at least<br>
0.5 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber<br>
component (C1), and preferably at least 0.8 parts by mass from the<br><br>
viewpoint of heat build-up. Further, it is at most 5 parts by mass and<br>
preferably at most 3 parts by mass because kneading processability is<br>
good.<br>
A hybrid crosslinking agent may be compounded for<br>
suppressing reversion. The hybrid crosslinking agent includes, for<br>
example, HTS and PK900 manufactured by Flexsys Chemicals Sdn<br>
Bhd and KA 9188 manufactured by Bayer AG.<br>
These modified resorcinol condensate and hybrid<br>
crosslinking agent can enhance complex elastic modulus E* and lessen<br>
loss tangent tan δ without forming ineffectual pendant crosslinking<br>
structure and branched crosslinking structure and without<br>
comparatively lowering elongation at break EB.<br>
Further, when complex elastic modulus E* is too low in<br>
clinch, clinch rubber is excessively deformed by compression at the<br>
grounding deformation of a tire, and peeling between case and clinch is<br>
easily generated by its strain and heat build-up.<br>
Complex elastic modulus E* measured at 70°C is preferably<br>
at least 4.5 MPa and more preferably at least 4.8 MPa because the<br>
rubber composition for clinch in the present invention is superior in<br>
elongation at break. Further, complex elastic modulus E* measured<br>
at 70°C is preferably at most 9.0 MPa and more preferably at most 8.0<br>
MPa because rolling resistance is superior.<br>
For the rubber composition for clinch (C) in the present<br>
invention, the lower the tan δ measured at 70°C is preferably less than<br>
0.12 and more preferably at most 0.11 because rolling resistance is low.<br>
The lower limit is usually 0.03.<br>
The tire of the present invention is produced by a usual<br><br>
method using the rubber composition for sidewall (A) as sidewall, the<br>
rubber composition for covering case cord (B) as the covering of the<br>
cord of case and the rubber composition for clinch (C) as clinch.<br>
Namely, the rubber composition for sidewall (A) and the rubber<br>
composition for clinch (C) are extruded and processed in matching with<br>
the forms of the sidewall and clinch at unvulcanization stage, case<br>
cord is covered with the rubber composition for covering case cord (B)<br>
to mold case, and they are laminated with other tire members on a tire<br>
molding machine; thereby an unvulcanized tire is formed. The tire of<br>
the present invention can be produced by heating and pressurizing the<br>
unvulcanized tire in a vulcanizer.<br>
Further, even if complex elastic modulus E* at sidewall<br>
portion is reduced, the influence of rolling resistance is little for a tire<br>
with high inner pressure (700 to 1000 kPa (7 to 10 kgf/cm2)), but the<br>
bending of the sidewall portion of a tire, namely complex elastic<br>
modulus E* affects rolling resistance for a tire used at low inner<br>
pressure (at most 300 kPa); therefore the tire of the present invention<br>
can be preferably used as tires for an automobile and tires for a light<br>
truck that are used at low inner pressure (at most 300 kPa).<br>

The tires were run on a drum at speed of 20 km/h under<br>
the condition of 230 % load of maximum loading (maximum inner<br><br>
pressure condition) JIS specification for 600 hours, then the abrasion<br>
depth of rim flange contact portion was measured, the rim deviation<br>
index of Production Example 11 was referred to as 100, and the<br>
abrasion depths of respective compoundings were displayed with<br>
indices by the calculation formula below. Further, it is indicated that<br>
the larger the rim deviation index is, the more hardly the rim deviation<br>
occurs and it is preferable.<br>
Rim deviation index = (Abrasion depth of Production<br>
Example 11) / (Abrasion depth of respective compounding) x 100<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 10 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 10<br>
The rubber compositions shown in Table 4 among the<br>
unvulcanized rubber compositions for sidewall respectively produced in<br>
Production Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Production Examples 1<br>
to 6 were molded in sidewall shape; cord (polyester cord available from<br>
Teijin Limited) was covered with the rubber compositions shown in<br>
Table 4 among the unvulcanized rubber compositions for covering case<br>
cord respectively produced in Production Examples 6 to 10 and<br>
Comparative Production Examples 7 to 12, to be molded in case shape;<br>
the unvulcanized rubber compositions for clinch respectively produced<br>
in Production Examples 10 to 15 and Comparative Production<br>
Examples 13 to 18 were molded in clinch shape; they were laminated<br>
with other tire members by the combination shown in Table 4; the<br>
unvulcanized tires of Examples 1 to 10 and Comparative Example 1 to<br>
10 were respectively formed, and tires for test (size: 195/65R15 GT065,<br>
tire for summer for an automobile) were produced by carrying out<br>
vulcanization by press under the condition of 170°C for 12 minutes.<br>
Rolling resistance and drum durability of these tires for test<br>
were determined by the following methods. The results of Examples<br>
are shown in Table 4 and the results of Comparative Example are<br>
shown in Table 5.<br>
(Rolling resistance)<br>
The rolling resistance of the tires for test under the<br>
conditions of rim size (15 × 6JJ), tire inner pressure (200 kPa), load<br>
(4.41 kN) and speed (80 km/h) was measured with a rolling resistance<br>
tester. Further, the rolling resistance index of the tire of Comparative<br>
Example 1 was referred to as 100, and the rolling resistance of<br><br>
respective compoundings was displayed with indices by the calculation<br>
formula below. Further, it is indicated that the smaller the rolling<br>
resistance index is, the more the rolling resistance is reduced and<br>
rolling resistance performance is good.<br>
(Rolling resistance index) = (Rolling resistance of respective<br>
compoundings) / (Rolling resistance of Comparative Example 1) x 100<br>
(Drum durability index)<br>
The tires were run on a drum at speed of 20 km/h at the<br>
condition of 230 % load which was the maximum loading (maximum<br>
inner pressure condition) of JIS specification, and the durability of the<br>
sidewall portion was tested. Running distance (running distance until<br>
the generation of swelling of the sidewall portion) until the fracture of<br>
interface between case cord and sidewall extends in a sidewall rubber<br>
and grows to separation was measured, the running distance of the<br>
tire in Comparative Example 1 was referred to as 100 and the running<br>
distances of respective compoundings were respectively displayed by<br>
indices (drum durability index) by the calculation formula below. The<br>
timing at which circular or semicircular swelling with a diameter of at<br>
least 5 cm was generated at the sidewall portion or broken holes were<br>
generated at the sidewall portion was referred to as the generation of<br>
the swelling of the sidewall portion. Further, it is indicated that the<br>
larger the drum durability index is, the more superior the durability of<br>
the sidewall portion is and it is good. In general, the larger the EB is<br>
and the smaller the tan δ is, the more hardly the separation is<br>
generated. Separation does not extend to the inner liner, but tan δ<br>
affects the temperature of the sidewall portion. The case, sidewall and<br>
clinch relates to durability. Loose does not extend in the clinch<br><br>
rubber itself, but when E* is appropriate and tan δ is small, fracture<br>
between the case cord and the sidewall is hardly generated.<br>
(Drum durability index) = (Running distance of respective<br>
compoundings) / (Running distance of Comparative Example 1) × 100<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It can be grasped from Tables 4 to 5 that Examples satisfy<br>
both of durability and rolling resistance and achieve step-up.<br>
According to the present invention, a tire satisfying both of<br>
the low rolling resistance of the tire and the improvement of tire<br>
strength can be provided by combining sidewall, case and clinch<br>
comprising a fixed rubber composition to prepare a tire.<br><br>
