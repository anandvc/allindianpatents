Substituents on a ring may also be present in either cis or trans form, and a substituent on a double bond may be present in either Z or E form.   It is intended that all such configurations (including enantiomers and diastereomers) are included within the scope of the present invention. Preferred compounds are those with the absolute configuration of the compound of this invention which produces the more desirable biological activity. Separated, pure or partially purified isomers or racemic mixtures of the compounds of this invention are also included within the scope of the present invention.<br>

In general, the compounds of this invention may be prepared by standard techniques known in the art, by known processes analogous thereto, and/or by processes disclosed below, using starting materials which are either commercially available, producible according to routine, conventional chemical methods or the synthesis of which is described herein. The particular process to be utilized in the preparation of a compound of this invention depends upon the specific compound desired. Such factors as whether the amine is substituted or not, the selection of the specific substituents possible at various locations on the molecule, and the like, each play a role in the path to be followed. Those factors are readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The general method used to prepare the compounds in this invention is illustrated in Reaction Scheme 1 below. The amino benzofuran or benzothiophene compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) may be synthesized by the condensation of haloketone of formula (Ha) or (Mb) and a properly substituted 2-cyanophenol (X=O) orthiophenol (X=S), and 1-aryl-2-halo-ethanone (III). The reaction conditions may be carried out under basic conditions (such as cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, DBU), in a solvent such as DMF and MeCN, and at temperatures between room temperature to 100 °C. The components lla, Mb, and III, can be prepared but not limited to the methods described below. The various means that used to prepare components (III) were summarized in method I, to prepare<br>
components Ha and Mb were summarized in method II, the synthesis of benzofuran core were summarized in method III, and the synthesis of benzothiophene core were summarized in method IV.<br>
It is to be understood that sensitive or reactive substituents attached to intermediates or to compounds of Formula (la) and (Ib) may need to be protected and deprotected during the preparations described above. Protecting groups in general may be added and removed by conventional methods well known in the art (see, e.g., T. W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis; Wiley: New York, (1999)).<br>
Variations of the compounds of the invention can be readily prepared using the processes described above and referenced below, or by other standard chemical processes known in the art, by employing appropriate starting materials or intermediate compounds that are readily available and/or are described herein.<br>
Generally, a desired salt of a compound of this invention can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of a compound by means well known in the art. For example, a desired salt can be prepared by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base or free acid form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, or suitable organic or<br>
inorganic base, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed. In the case of basic compounds, for example, the free base is treated with anhydrous HCI in a suitable solvent such as THF, and the salt isolated as a hydrochloride salt. In the case of acidic compounds, the salts may be obtained, for example, by treatment of the free acid with anhydrous ammonia in a suitable solvent such as ether and subsequent isolation of the ammonium salt. These methods are conventional and would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be esterified by a variety of conventional procedures including reacting the appropriate anhydride, carboxylic acid or acid chloride with the alcohol group of a compound of this invention. The appropriate anhydride is reacted with the alcohol in the presence of a base to facilitate acylation such as 1,8-bis[dimethylamino]naphthalene or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine. Or, an appropriate carboxylic acid can be reacted with the alcohol in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide or other water soluble dehydrating agents which are used to drive the reaction by the removal of water, and, optionally, an acylation catalyst. Esterification can also be effected using the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride and, optionally, pyridine, or in the presence of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole with pyridine. Reaction of an acid chloride with the alcohol can be carried out with an acylation catalyst such as 4-DMAP or pyridine.<br>
One skilled in the art would readily know how to successfully carry out these as well as other known methods of esterification of alcohols.<br>
The purification of isomers and the separation of isomeric mixtures of a compound of Formula (la) and (Ib) may be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
The following examples are provided to further illustrate the compounds of the invention and their preparation but should not be construed to be limiting in any way.<br>
Preparative Examples of the Invention<br>
Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured with a General Electric G/V-Omega 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer with either Me4Si (5 0.00) or residual protonated solvent (CHCI3 8 7.26; MeOH 83.30; DMSO 8 2.49) as standard. Carbon (13C) NMR spectra were measured with a General Electric GA/-Omega 300 (75 MHz)<br>
spectrometer with solvent (CDCI3 8 77.0; d3-MeOD; 8 49.0; d6-DMSO 8 39.5) as standard.<br>
Chiral separations were performed using a commercially available Chiracel® AD HPLC column, eluting with a gradient of isopropanol in hexane (from 1% to 15%) with addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
General Method I: Preparation of Intermediate 1-arvl-2-halo-ethanones (III)<br>
The starting ketones of formula (III) are prepared by the methods exemplified below.<br>
Example 1 Method 1-1<br>
Preparation 2-bromo-1 -(2.4.6-trichlorophenvl)ethanone<br>
A mixture of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (10.0 g, 55.1 mmol), 2-bromoacetyl bromide (5.0 mL, 57.8 mmol, 1.05 eq), and aluminum chloride (7.7 g, 57.8 mmol, 1.05 eq) was heated neat at 80 °C under argon for 17 h until a black precipitate is formed. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and the resultant black mass was dissolved in ethyl acetate (500 ml). Water (200 ml) was added slowly at 0 °C to quench the reaction, and the biphasic layers were separated. The organic layer was then washed with water (2 x 150 mL) and brine (1 x 150 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. Recrystallization from hexane gave 11.5 g (69.3%) of 2-bromo-1-(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)ethanone as a fluffy white solid. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 5 7.86 (s, 2H), 4.78 (s, 2H); Rf = 0.28, 2% ethyl acetate -hexane.<br>
Example 2<br>
Method I-2 Preparation of 2-bromo-1-(2.5-dichlorophenvnethanone<br>
Cl<br>
To 2,5-dichloroacetophenone (5.0 g, 26.45 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (53 mL) under argon was added phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide (9.94 g, 26.45 mmol, 1.0<br>

Illustrative of oils which can be used in the parenteral formulations of this invention are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, petrolatum and mineral oil. Suitable fatty acids include oleic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid and myristic acid. Suitable fatty acid esters are, for example, ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Suitable soaps include fatty acid alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts and suitable detergents include cationic detergents, for example dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, alkyl pyridinium halides, and alkylamine acetates; anionic detergents, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates; non-ionic detergents, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and poly(oxyethylene-<br>
oxypropylene)s or ethylene oxide or propylene oxide copolymers; and amphoteric detergents, for example, alkyl-beta-aminopropionates, and 2-alkylimidazoline quarternary ammonium salts, as well as mixtures.<br>
The parenteral compositions of this invention will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulation ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The surfactant can be a single component having the above HLB or can be a mixture of two or more components having the desired HLB.<br>
Illustrative of surfactants used in parenteral formulations are the class of polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, for example, sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of sterile injectable aqueous suspensions. Such suspensions may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents which may be a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadeca-ethyleneoxycetanol, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived form a fatty acid and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or a condensation product of an ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.<br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Diluents and solvents that may be employed are, for example, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solutions and isotonic glucose solutions.

In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid<br>
can be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
A composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritation excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such material are, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, incorporated herein by reference). Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Controlled release formulations for parenteral administration include liposomal, polymeric microsphere and polymeric gel formulations which are known in the art.<br>
It may be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the patient via a mechanical delivery device. The construction and use of mechanical delivery devices for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. Direct techniques for, for example, administering a drug directly to the brain usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the patient's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system, used for the transport of agents to specific anatomical regions of the body, is described in US Patent No. 5,011,472, issued April 30, 1991.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also contain other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable compounding ingredients, generally referred to as carriers or diluents, as necessary or desired. Conventional procedures for preparing such compositions in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized.   Such ingredients and procedures include those described in the following references, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: Powell, M.F. et al, "Compendium of Excipients for Parenteral Formulations" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Technology 1998, 52(5), 238-311; Strickley, R.G "Parenteral Formulations of Small Molecule Therapeutics Marketed in the United States (1999)-Part-1" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Technology 1999, 53(6), 324-349;<br>

H460 cells (lung carcinoma, purchased from ATCC) are plated in 96-well plates at 3000 cells/well in complete media with 10% Fetal Calf Serum and incubated 24 hours at 37°C. Twenty-four hours after plating, test compounds are added over a final concentration range of 10 nM to 20 |xM in serial dilutions at a final DMSO concentration of 0.2 %. Cells are incubated for 72 hours at 37°C in complete growth media after addition of the test compound. On day 4, using a Promega Cell Titer Glo Luminescent® assay kit, the cells are lysed and 100 microliters of substrate/buffer mixture is added to each well, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 8 minutes.   The samples are read on a luminometer to measure the amount of ATP present in the cell lysates from each well, which corresponds to<br>
the number of viable cells in that well. Values read at 24-hour incubation are subtracted as Day 0. For determination of ICSO's, a linear regression analysis can be used to determine drug concentration which results in a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation using this assay format. Compounds of this invention showed a significant inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in this assay.<br>
Based upon the above and other standard laboratory techniques known to evaluate compounds useful for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases or disorders described above by standard toxicity tests and by standard pharmacological assays for the determination of the prevention and/or treatment of the conditions identified above in mammals, and by comparison of these results with the results of known medicaments that are used to treat these conditions, the effective dosage of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined for prevention and/or treatment of each desired indication. The amount of the active ingredient to be administered in the prevention and/or treatment of one of these conditions can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed, the mode of administration, the duration of treatment (including prophylactic treatment), the age and sex of the patient treated, and the nature and extent of the condition to be prevented and/or treated.<br>
The total amount of the active ingredient to be administered will generally range from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg, and preferably from about 0.10 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg body weight per day. A unit dosage may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 1500 mg of active ingredient, and can be administered one or more times per day. The daily dosage for administration by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, and use of infusion techniques will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The daily rectal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The daily vaginal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 to 200 mg administered between one to four times daily. The transdermal concentration will preferably be that required to maintain a daily dose of from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of total body weight.<br>
Of course the specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary according to the nature and severity of the condition as determined by the attending<br>
diagnostician, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age and general condition of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion of the drug, drug combinations, and the like. The desired mode of administration and number of doses of a compound or composition of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional prevention and/or treatment tests.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered as the sole pharmaceutical agent or in combination with one or more other pharmaceutical agents where the combination causes no unacceptable adverse effects. For example, the compounds of this invention can be combined with other anti-hyper-proliferative or other indication agents, and the like, as well as with admixtures and combinations thereof.<br>
