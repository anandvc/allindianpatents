This invention relates to a novel process for preparing a chemical<br>
intermediate useful in the preparation of fluticasone propionate.<br>
5	Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid of the androstane family which<br>
One process for preparing fluticasone propionate comprises reacting a compound of formula (II)<br>
has potent anti-inflammatory activity and is widely accepted as a useful therapy for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions such as rhinitis and asthma. The chemical representation of fluticasone propionate is as shown in the structure below:<br><br><br>
with a compound of formula LCH2F, where L represents a leaving group mesyl, tosyl or halogen, eg Cl, Br or I. Preferably L represents halogen, particularly Br.<br>
According to prior art processes, eg as described in G.H. Phillips etal (1994) J Med Chem 37, 3717-3729 and US patent 4,335,121 (Glaxo Group Limited), compounds of formula (II) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
2<br><br>
with an activated derivative of propionic acid eg propionyl chloride. The activated derivative of propionic acid will generally be employed in at least 2 times molar quantity relative to the compound of formula (III) since one mole of the reagent will react with the thioacid moiety and needs to be removed eg by reaction with an amine such as diethylamine.<br>
This method for the preparation of compound of formula (II) suffers from disadvantages, however, in that the resultant compound of formula (II) is not readily purified of contamination with the by-product N.N-diethylpropanamide. We have therefore invented an improved process for performing the conversion to prepare compound of formula (II).<br>
Other processes for preparation of fluticasone propionate and related compounds are described in Israeli patent aplication 109656 (Chemagis), WO01/62722 (Abbott) and Kertesz and Marx (1986) J Org Chem 51,2315-2328.<br>
Thus according to the invention there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
or a salt thereof<br>
which comprises:<br>
(a)      reacting a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
3<br><br>
with an activated derivative of propionic acid in an amount of at least 1.3 moles, suitably at least 2 moles, of the activated derivative per mole of compound of formula (III) and;<br>
(b)      removal of the sulphur-linked propionyl moiety from any compound of formula (IIA)<br><br>
so formed by reaction of the product of step (a) with an organic primary or secondary amine base capable of forming a water soluble propanamide.<br>
in step (a), examples of activated derivatives of propionic acid include activated esters or preferably a propionyl halide such as propionyl chloride. This reaction is conventionally performed in the presence of an unreactive organic base such as a triC1-4alkylamine eg tri-n-propylamine, triethylamine, or, tributylamine especially triethylamine, but most preferably tri-n-propylarnine. Solvents for this process include substantially water immiscible solvents such as ethyl acetate or methyl acetate or water miscible solvents such as,acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide or N.N-dimethylacetamide, especially acetope. Substantially immiscible solvents provide two phases when the solvents are mixed and have a low level of solubility one in the other eg the solubility of one solvent in the other solvent is less than 30% w/w, for example 10% w/w, especially 5% w/w.<br>
In step (b), examples of organic primary or secondary amine base capable of forming a water soluble propanamide include amines which are more polar than diethylamine, for example an alcoholamine, e.g. diethanolamine, or a<br><br>
4<br>
diamine, for example N-methylpiperazine. Preferably, N-methylpiperazine is employed. It may be convenient to dissolve the amine in small volume of an organic solvent such as methanol.<br>
Preferably steps (a) and (b) are performed at reduced temperature eg 0-5°C.<br>
As a further aspect of the invention we provide methods for the efficient purification of the compound of formula (II).<br>
Thus a first such process (d) comprises, when the product of step (b) is dissolved in a substantially immiscible organic solvent (such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, or a higher alkanone such as a pentan-3-one), purifying the compound of formula (II) by washing out the amide by-product from step (b) with an aqueous wash. For example water may be added to the reaction mixture, stirred, the phases allowed to separate, and the lower aqueous layer run off.<br>
Preferably, the substantially immiscible solvent is pentan-3-one.<br>
The remaining organic layer may be concentrated by distillation optionally at reduced pressure and then an antisolvent (eg hexane) may be added to crystallise the dissolved product.<br>
A second such process (c2) comprises, when the product of step (b) is dissolved in a water miscible solvent (eg acetone), purifying the compound of formula (II) by treating the compound of step (b) with an aqueous medium so as to precipitate out pure compound of formula (II). The amide by-product from step (b) will accordingly substantially remain in the aqueous phase.<br>
The aqueous medium may, for example, be a dilute aqueous acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid or acetic acid.<br>
Further general conditions pertaining to the conversion of the compound of formula (III) to the compound of formula (II) and salts thereof and the isolation of the end product will be well known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
According to a preferred set of conditions, however, we have found that the compound of formula (II) may advantageously be isolated following process (d) in the form of a solid crystalline salt rather than the free compound of formula (II). The preferred salt is formed with a base such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, N-ethylpiperidine or with potassium. Such salt forms of compound of formula (II) are more stable, more readily filtered and dried and can be isolated in higher purity than the free compound of formula (II). The most preferred salt is the salt formed with triethylamine. The potassium salt is also of interest.<br>
Thus a preferred process, following process (c1), comprises treating the organic phase containing the compound of formula (II) with a base so as to precipitate the compound of formula (II) in the form of a solid crystalline salt.<br><br>
5<br>
Example bases include triethylamine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, N-ethylpiperidine or a basic potassium salt eg potassium hydrogen carbonate.<br>
We claim a compound of formula (II) isolated in the form of a solid crystalline salt as a further aspect of the invention.<br>
As a further aspect of the invention we also provide a process for preparing fluticasone propionate which comprises preparing a compound of formula (II) or a salt thereof as just described and converting the compound of formula (II) or salt thereof to fluticasone propionate by treatment with a compound of formula LCH2F wherein L mcresents a leaving group.<br>
According to the invention compound of formula (II) may advantageously be isolated with higher efficiency than by means of prior art processes. For example, the process for the preparation of the compound of formula (II) disclosed in G.H. Phillips et al (1994) J Med Chem 37, 3717-3729 involves the isolation of the product from an acetone/water system. The product so prepared is extremely difficult to filter. In contrast, the compound of formula (II), when prepared in accordance with the present invention, is far easier to filter. Furthermore, the process of the present invention may also offer improvements in purity.<br>
It is additionally advantageous to prepare and use the compound of formula (III) as an imidazole salt. G.H. Phillips et al (1994) J Med Chem 37, 3717-3729 disclose the preparation of a compound of formula (III) from a compound of formula (IV). However, the physicochemical properties of the compound of formula (III) so prepared result in a product which has a very low speed of filtration. The advantages conferred by the preparation of the imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III) include its properties as an easily prepared and rapidly-filterable, easily handled and stored source of a compound of formula (III), which compound may readily be obtained from the salt by acidification, for example with hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, the compound of formula (III) so derived is of enhanced purity. The imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III) may be prepared, isolated, and stored for subsequent use in the process for the preparation of the compound of formula (II) as described herein. Alternatively, the imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III) may be prepared and used directly as a wet cake in the subsequent conversion to a compound of formula (II) thus avoiding the need to dry the imidazole salt before further reaction.<br>
It is considered that the imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III) is new and accordingly forms a further aspect of the invention. There is also further provided a process for the preparation of the, imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III) which process comprises the reaction of a compound of formula (IV) with carbonyldiimidazole and hydrogen sulphide.<br><br>
6<br><br>
Typically, the compound of formula (IV) and between 1.1 and 2.5 equivalents, suitable 1.8 equivalents, of carbonyidiimidazole are stirred in a suitable solvent, for example ethyl acetate containing between 0 and 2 vol., suitably 0.5 vol., of N,N-dimethylformamide, at a suitable temperature, for example 18-20°C, for a suitable period of time, for example one hour. The resulting suspension is cooled to a suitable temperature, for example -5 to 5°C, suitably -3 to 3°C, and hydrogen sulphide gas introduced over a period of 15-60 minutes, suitably 20-30 minutes, while the suspension is stirred. The reaction mixture is stirred for a further period of about 30 minutes at -5 to 5°C, warmed to about 10°C over a period of about 20 minutes and stirred at 6-12°C for 90-120 minutes. The product is then isolated by filtration, at a suitable temperature, suitably 5-25°C, preferably 10-15°C, washed with a suitable solvent, for example ethyl acetate, and dried in vacuo to yield the imidazole salt of the compound of formula (III).<br>
The compound of formula (III) is a monobasic acid and therefore would be expected to form an imidazole salt wherein the stoichiometry of the imidazole salting moiety to the compound of formula (III) is approximately 1:1. However, it has surprisingly been found that the stoichiometry of the imidazole salting moiety to the compound of formula (III) may be up to and including 4:1. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, the term "imidazole salt" encompasses imidazole salts of the compound of formula (III) and association compounds of the compound of formula (III) and imidazole wherein the stoichiometry of the imidazole moiety to the compound of formula (III) is up to and including 4:1, for example 1:1 to 4:1, suitably 1.8:1 to 2.5:1. An example of a typical stoichiometry is 2:1. It will be understood that, in the context of stoichiometric values, exact numerical values are to be construed to include nominal variations therefrom.<br>
Preferably^ the compound of formula (III) used in the process described herein is used as its imidazole salt.<br>
The invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples.<br>
