				<td>A BIO-DEGRADABLE PLANT GROWTH COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable plant growth composition<br>
which is based on particulate coal.<br>
The plant growth composition of the invention represents an improvement in<br>
the formulation described in U.S. Patent 4,541,857, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,541,857 describes a plant fertilizer composition which<br>
comprises a mixture of particulate coal containing releasable plant nutrients, sodium<br>
molybdate which serves to release the plant nutrients in a form that plants can use,<br>
and one or more auxiliary agents selected from ferric sulfate, magnesium sulfate,<br>
sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, copper sulfate, sulfur, hydrated sodium<br>
borate, brunt limestone and cobalt carbonate. The coal particulate has a maximum<br>
mesh size of about 100 mesh and comprises from about 50-75 weight percent of the<br>
total weight of the composition, the molybdate is present in an amount ranging from<br>
0.001 to 0.100 percent by weight of the composition and the auxiliary agent(s)<br>
comprise the balance of the composition.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
As indicated, the present invention provides certain improvements in the<br>
compositions described in U.S. Patent 4,541,857. These improvements maintain the<br>
useful features of the composition described in the earlier patent but also result in<br>
further advantages as detailed hereinafter, including, for example, enhanced growth<br>
and yield of plants and expanded applicability and use of the composition.<br>
An important modification in the compositions of U.S. 4,541,857 which the<br>
present invention provides is the use of a linear alcohol alkoxylate, e.g. a<br>
poly(ethylene oxide) ether with a C12-C15 linear primary alcohol.<br>
Other essential features of the present composition include the use of a<br>
substantial amount of sand and a small amount of water. Further features will also<br>
be evident from the more detailed description of the invention which follows.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The plant growth composition of the invention consists essentially of the<br>
following components:<br>
(1) 40-80%, preferably 70-80%, by weight of particulate coal;<br>
(2) 0.01 to 1%, preferably 0.5 to 1%, by weight of sodium molybdate;<br>
(3) from 0.2 to 2% by weight water;<br>
(4) from 0.1 to 1% by weight of linear alcohol alkoxylate;<br>
(5) from .001 to 4% by weight of magnesium sulfate; with<br>
(6) the balance, usually in an amount of about 20-60% by weight of the<br>
overall composition, being sand.<br>
The composition thus consists primarily of coal and sand in its preferred<br>
embodiment although molybdate, linear alcohol alkoxylate, magnesium sulfate and<br>
water, within the limits indicated, are also essential for the success of the invention.<br>
Of the indicated components, the coal particulate is advantageously as<br>
described in the earlier U.S. Patent 4,541,857 referred to above! Thus, the coal<br>
particulate may be of any type, for instance, anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous<br>
or lignite, and can be of varying quality all of which generally contain from about 0.5<br>
to 3.0 percent of known nitrogen. Other plant nutrients present in coal and made<br>
available for use by plants in accordance with the present invention include iron,<br>
phosphorus, potassium, sulfur or sulfates, calcium, chloride and at least traces of<br>
manganese, copper, boron, cobalt, alumina and selenium. High sulfur content coal<br>
has been found to be particularly advantageous.<br>
Advantageously, the coal is of 100 mesh particufate size or smaller, i.e. it is<br>
such that it passes through a 100 mesh Tyler Screen. Larger and smaller sizes can<br>
be effectively used ranging from, for example, -50 mesh to about -300 mesh.<br>
Particles larger than 100 mesh, however, tend to release plant nutrients more slowly.<br>
Hence, it is preferred to use a coal particulate of 100 mesh size or finer, i.e. particles -.<br>
which will pass through a 100 mesh Tyler Screen.<br>
While any type of coal can be used, preferably one of high sulfur content, the<br>
coal composition specifically exemplified in U.S. 4,541,857 may be cited as typical<br>
for use herein. Such coal, on a dry basis, has the following ultimate analysis:<br>
carbon: 73.19%<br>
hydrogen: 5.05%<br>
nitrogen: 1.32%<br>
chlorine: 0.07%<br>
sulfur: 4.50%<br>
ash: 6.00% and<br>
oxygen: 9.87%<br>
This composition can also be defined on a mineral analysis-ignited basis as follows:<br>
phosphorus pentoxide: 0.26%<br>
silica:  32.95%<br>
ferric oxide: 33.09%<br>
alumina: 22.13%<br>
titania: 0.68%<br>
lime:  2.66%<br>
manganese: 0.52%<br>
sulfur trixoide: 3.24%<br>
potassium oxide: 1.43%<br>
sodium oxide: 0,51% and<br>
undetermined: 2.53%<br>
As explained in U.S. 4,541,857, the sodium molybdate appears to function in<br>
some way to digest the coal particulate and to release plant nutrients from the<br>
participate in a way which enables plants to effectively and advantageously use<br>
these nutrients. While the amount of molybdate can be varied and may in some<br>
instances fall outside the ranges earlier stated, depending on the nature and size of<br>
the coal particulate, best results appear to be obtainable when the molybdate<br>
content is in the range of 0.5-1 % by weight of the total composition. More than this<br>
preferred amount can be used although it is believed that effective digestion of the<br>
coal is realized by using the molybdate in the amount indicated.<br>
The linear alcohol alkoxylate is preferably a primary linear C12 to C15 alcohol,<br>
e.g. dodecyl alcohol or mixture thereof with other C12-C15 alcohol, which has been<br>
ethoxylated, i.e. a polyethylene oxide ether of a primary linear alcohol, preferably a<br>
primary alcohol of 12-15 carbons. A preferred linear alcohol alkoxylate for use<br>
herein is available commercially as "Basic H" surfactant. This material, or its<br>
equivalent, may be used for present purposes.<br>
As indicated, the composition should also contain a small amount of water,<br>
usually not more than about 2% by weight. It appears that this small amount of<br>
water facilitates the effect of the alkoxylate and also seems to help activate the plant<br>
growth elements of the coal component.<br>
Any convenient source of sand may be used. The amount of sand employed<br>
can be varied and will depend, at least to some extent, on the nature and<br>
composition of the coal component, and the amounts of other materials present.<br>
However, generally speaking, the amount of sand in the composition will fall within<br>
the range earlier stated herein, i.e. 20-60% by weight.<br>
Optimum results appear to be obtained with sand which includes small<br>
amounts, e.g. 0.001 to 0.01% by weight, of magnesium sulfate, copper sulfate and<br>
other similar trace metal sulfates. <br>
In addition to any magnesium sulfate which may be included in the sand, it is<br>
useful to add magnesium sulfate in an amount of from .001 to 4% by weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
The composition may be prepared in any convenient fashion. Preferably,<br>
however, the coal and sand are uniformly mixed together after which the sodium<br>
molybdate, alkoxylate and magnesium sulfate, in water are sprayed over the<br>
coal/sand mixture while stirring to insure uniformity. The product is then allowed to<br>
dry after which it may be bagged for later use or applied directly to the soil at the<br>
place of use.<br>
As an alternative, the mixture of coal and sand may be placed at the site of<br>
use, e.g. around the base of a fruit tree, after which an aqueous mix of molybdate<br>
and alkoxylate is sprayed over the coal/sand mix. The magnesium sulfate may be<br>
included in the aqueous spray of alkoxylate and molybdate or it may be included in<br>
the coal/sand mix.<br>
In a typical preparation, 1 to 4 ounces of sodium molybdate and up to 1 gallon<br>
of the alkoxylate, with or without magnesium sulfate, are mixed with 50 gallons, more<br>
or less, of water to form a spray mixture. This mixture is then sprayed over a dry mix<br>
of coal particulate and sand and magnesium sulfate. Advantageously the mixture of<br>
molybdate and alkoxylate in water is sprayed over a dry mix of coal, sand and<br>
magnesium sulfate after the dry mix has been applied to the field or soil where plant<br>
growth is desired although, as earlier noted, the entire composition, including the<br>
molybdate and alkoxylate, can be prepared before application to the field or soil.<br>
. Whether pre-formed or prepared in situ, it appears that the spray of molybdate and<br>
alkoxylate helps to activate the nutrients or growth elements in the coal.<br>
The composition of the invention is usable under most, if not all, soil<br>
conditions globally. An important advantage of the invention, as shown below, is that<br>
the composition appears to be able to convert soil which is unsatisfactory for<br>
agricultural purposes into soil which is highly useful. In extensive testing, the product<br>
has consistently exceeded yield by 50-100% per acre production as measured<br>
against conventionally available N-P-K fertilizers which are in common usage.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
70 lbs. of high-sulfur coal were pulverized to a particle size of-100 mesh and<br>
mixed with 25 lbs. of sand and 4 lbs. of magnesium sulfate. The resultant mix was<br>
then placed around the base of peach trees, unfilled, growing in clay soil in Western<br>
Pennsylvania in the spring. Clay soil and the Western Pennsylvania climate are not<br>
generally favorable for growing peaches. The trees had been barren for 8 years.<br>
After the dry mix was spread (not plowed) around the trees, the mixture was<br>
sprayed with a liquid composition comprising 50 gallons of water, 1 gallon Basic H<br>
type (polyethylene oxide ether of C12-C15 primary alcohols) and 4 ounces of sodium<br>
molybdate. No pesticides, herbicides, insecticides or fungicides were used. The<br>
resulting peaches appeared to be flawless with excellent rich color and superior<br>
taste. The yield over the growing period (about 4 months) was so large per tree that<br>
wooden support stakes had to be used to prop the trees up under the weight of the<br>
fruit crop.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1was repeated except that, in this case, the composition was used<br>
with 30 year old apple trees which were past their prime and growing in clay soil in<br>
Pennsylvania. Although in this case the apple trees had previously borne fruit, the<br>
yield had been sparse. About 100 pounds of the composition spread around the<br>
base of the tree followed by spraying with the liquid mixture referred to in Example 1.<br>
The composition was applied around the trees in April. The trees blossomed in May<br>
and bore fruit by late summer. The yield of apples obtained was greatly increased<br>
over past years. The quality of the apples was also outstanding.<br>
Example 3<br>
Improvements in yield, quality and size were also obtained when the<br>
experiment of Example 2 was repeated with stonehead cabbages grown in the same<br>
Pennsylvania clay soil. The expected normal cabbage diameter was about six<br>
inches. However, by applying the composition to the soil in the spring immediately<br>
after planting, cabbages that were fourteen inches in diameter were consistently<br>
obtained by mid-summer. Insect damage was essentially non-existent although no<br>
pesticide was applied. The indicated results were obtained notwithstanding the fact<br>
that weeds were intentionally not removed and consequently competed with the<br>
cabbage for soil nutrients.<br>
It was noted, in conducting the tests referred to in the foregoing Examples,<br>
that earthworms tended to arrive during crop growth and remained in the soil,<br>
thereby functioning to nutritionally enrich the soil.<br>
Example 4<br>
The growth composition of Example 1 was compared with a commercially<br>
available N-P-K fertilizer in a 24 acre corn field test. The field had been unusable for<br>
40 to 50 years. It was located on a mountain and had 1 inch of soil before shale rock<br>
was encountered, representing the worst type of field test conditions. It was<br>
estimated that 4000 lbs. of limestone, 120 pounds of nitrogen and 180 pounds of<br>
phosphorus would have to be used on each acre to effectively grow corn on the site.<br>
However, it was decided to use only about 200 pounds per acre of the present<br>
composition with no lime.<br>
Photographs were taken periodically. The N-P-K corn field, comprising a four-<br>
acre plot, failed as expected. No crop resulted on any of the four acres with stunted<br>
ears of shriveled "bread and butter" corn seen only sporadically. This was typical of<br>
prior results.<br>
The adjoining portion of the test field, separated from the N-P-K corn plot by<br>
only 12 yards, involved 20 acres using a growth composition according to Example<br>
1. All 20 acres yielded useful corn plants some of which stood 104 inches high. The<br>
crop was a complete success yielding an average of 100 bushels of perfectly shaped<br>
"bread and butter" corn per acre for each of the 20 test acres whereas, in the past,<br>
using lime and N-P-K fertilizer, the total yield was 50 bushels of corn for the entire 24<br>
acre field. No pesticides or herbicides were used in the experiment, no stock<br>
damage or discoloration occurred; and the kernels of corn were found to be in<br>
perfect rows. Furthermore, in addition to the greatly increased yield per acre,<br>
significantly less growth composition according to the invention was used on the 20<br>
acre tract than on the 4 acre failed U-P-K field.<br>
The results of Example 4 indicate that the growth composition of the invention<br>
can be used for the production of corn on underused or farm lands which would<br>
otherwise be considered too poor to be useful. Such production could be highly<br>
valuable in, for example, ethanol production.<br>
It will be appreciated that the amount of the present composition which is<br>
applied to the soil can be widely varied. It has been found that the application of 200<br>
pounds of the composition, e.g. the composition of Example 1, per acre is usually<br>
effective to give the desired results. More or less than this amount can be used, the<br>
optimum amount for any particular situation being readily determined by varying the<br>
application and observing the results. The use of from about 100 to 300 pounds, or<br>
more, per acre is generally sufficient to obtain the desired results with something<br>
around 200 pounds per acre being preferred.<br>
While the invention has been shown in the foregoing examples to improve the<br>
yield of fruit (apples and peaches), corn and cabbage, the invention is not limited to<br>
such fruits or vegetables. Similar improved results have been obtained with, for<br>
example, tomatoes, hay, alfalfa or the like. In another application of the invention,<br>
the composition has been used to grow effective grass cover over ground made bare<br>
by coal mine stripping. In that particular situation, it had previously been impossible<br>
to provide ground cover as required by state and Federal authorities. The<br>
composition of the invention was sprayed as an aqueous spray (hydroseeded) with<br>
grass seed over the ground and, in about two weeks time, complete ground cover<br>
was obtained.<br>
Analysis of a composition according to the invention as used in the foregoing<br>
examples for percent solids, volatile solids, total carbon (Total C), total nitrogen<br>
(Total N), organic nitrogen (Org-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), phosphorus (P),<br>
potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), cadmium (Cd),<br>
chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) has given<br>
the following results:<br>
Major Constituents (all values in percent by mass ± standard deviation)<br>
Solids 95.9 ±0.14<br>
Volatiles 35.8 ±4.7<br>
Total C 22.7 ±1.1<br>
Total N 4.98 ±0.16<br>
OrgN  3.17 ±0.35<br>
NH4-N  1.82 ±0.50<br>
P  2.1 ±0.33<br>
K  5.6 ±0.69<br>
Mg  2.1 ±0.11<br>
Ca  6.6 ±0.35<br>
Na  029 ± 0.02<br>
Fe  0.63 ±0.02<br>
Al  2.1 ±0.16<br>
Mn  0.31 ±0.02.<br>
Trace Elements (all values in mg/kg or ppm ± standard deviation)<br>
Cd  0.46 ± 0.02<br>
Cr  49.85 ±4.59<br>
Cu  9.35 ± 0.35<br>
Pb  42.15 ±2.05<br>
Ni  1.5 ±014<br>
Zn  33.5 ±2.19<br>
B  184 ±13<br>
The Mo content was not determined in the analysis.<br>
Based on the foregoing analysis, the composition could be viewed as a 5-5-7<br>
(N-P-K) composition where N is presented as %N, P is presented as %P2O5 and K is<br>
presented as %K2O, as is typical for fertilizer assays. The precise formulation is 5-<br>
4.8-6.8. Therefore, 10 dry tons of this material will supply 100 fbs. of Total N, and<br>
2.4 dry tons of the material will supply 100 lbs. of P. None of the trace elements are<br>
present at concentrations that would pose a concern for land application of this<br>
material as a fertilizer. Although Cr, Pb and Zn concentrations are greater than 10<br>
ppm, these values are not any higher than one would measure in unpolluted<br>
(pristine) soils because these elements are present in rock materials as well. The<br>
high concentration of organic C and N indicates that addition of the material to soil<br>
would increase the organic matter content of the soil, resulting in an overall<br>
improvement in soil quality, over and above that resulting from an equivalent amount<br>
of nutrient addition alone.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the composition of the invention<br>
offers a number of important advantages. For one thing, the composition, in addition<br>
to improving crop yields and functioning in less than optimum soil conditions, has the<br>
direct effect of enriching soil, not depleting it. As is well known, the use of N-P-K<br>
fertilizer has the opposite effect. Soils throughout the world have been severely<br>
depleted of nutrients, and polluted by the use of insecticides, herbicides, pesticides<br>
and fungicides over centuries of usage but especially during the past 50 years.<br>
Excessive, repeated and ever-increasing amounts of N-P-K (nitrogen, phosphate<br>
and potash) or artificial fertilizer have been required to yield crops from the depleted<br>
soil, all at ever-increasing cost and all this occurring while the quality of crops such<br>
as corn, tomato, watermelon or other vegetable or fruit, is diminished. Tests with the<br>
invention indicate that less of the growth compound is required per acre to match<br>
and exceed crop yields from artificial commercial fertilizer blends (N-P-K).<br>
Additionally, the present composition appears to minimize the need for pesticides,<br>
insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. This has been true with all crops tested from<br>
corn to cabbage, tomatoes, melons, peaches, appfes, beans and other vegetabfes.<br>
In all testing to date, no pesticides or herbicides have been required or used on the<br>
crops. No negative side effects have been observed and, in fact, the opposite<br>
appears to be true in the resultant addition of nutrients to the soil and consequent<br>
improved crop yield.<br>
In addition to reducing costs while improving plant growth results, the<br>
composition of the invention offers a number of other advantages. For example, the<br>
invention can be used to reclaim previously unusable soils, e.g. coal strip-mining and<br>
deep-mining soil. As a test, the composition of the invention as in Examples 1-4 was<br>
applied on the surface of "hot" or acidic soil resulting from a coal mining operation in<br>
Pennsylvania. Previous attempts to create ground cover as required by authorities<br>
had failed. However, effective ground cover was obtained over the area in about 10<br>
days after application of the present composition.<br>
As will be appreciated from the foregoing, advantages of the present<br>
composition include the following: it avoids the use of costly N-P-K fertilizers or the<br>
equivalent and the disadvantages of such fertilizers. It eliminates or reduces<br>
substantially the need for pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, the composition<br>
apparently tending to fend off such pests naturally. It appears to enable and<br>
promote more uniform water penetration in the soil making the nutrients released<br>
from the coal more available to the plant over a shorter period of time than possible<br>
with conventional fertilizers. Additionally, the present composition has no negative<br>
effect on soil pH, results in greener plant leaves, promotes sprouting of seeds,<br>
increases plant yield, promotes the appearance of earthworms which aid the nutrient<br>
enrichment of the soil, promotes larger, taller and thicker plants, crops and plant<br>
stalks; promotes more efficient water usage because it retains water in the soil<br>
thereby reducing soil erosion, water evaporation and water runoff, white separately<br>
promoting drainage in soil areas of excessive water accumulation and promotes<br>
water retention during dry weather, but, conversely, helps water leach through the<br>
soil in hot or dry weather.<br>
Various modifications may be made in the invention as described above and<br>
as define in the following claims wherein:<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A bio-degradable plant growth composition consisting essentially of coal<br>
particulate, sodium molybdate, linear alcohol alkoxylate, magnesium sulphate,<br>
sand and water.<br>

80% by weight coal particulate of 100 mesh or finer; from 0.01 to 1% by weight<br>

linear alcohol alkoxylate; from 0.001 to 4 % by weight of magnesium sulphate;<br>
and the balance, about 20 to 60% by weight of sand.<br>
