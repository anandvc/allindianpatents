Novel Thioether Derivatives, Their Method for Production<br>
and Use<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel thioether<br>
derivatives, the production method and use thereof, and relates<br>
especially to the S containing dendrimers and the synthetic<br>
intermediates thereof. The thioether derivatives and their<br>
intermediates of the present invention have industrial and<br>
pharmaceutical applications.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
The dendritic molecules, having a unique macromolecular<br>
structure, are expected to have a wide field of application.<br>
The dendritic molecules which have a unique chemical structure<br>
composed of a central core (nucleus), and a branch structure<br>
constructed with branches (units) repeated regularly and the<br>
surface functional groups, both extending<br>
three-dimensionally, have been investigated actively in the<br>
field, for example, of nano science, communication science,<br>
electro-material science, medical science, pharmaceutical<br>
science, biological science, surface science and material<br>
science, and so on (References: "Dendritic Molecules", VCH<br>
Publication Co. 1996; "Molecular Design of Dendrimers" and<br>
"Miscellaneous Functions of Dendrimers" Gendai Kagaku, June,<br>
1998, on pp. 20-40; "Applications of Dendrimers as Non-linear<br>
Optical Materials" in Kobunshi, Vol.47, November, 1998.) It<br><br>
may safely be said, however, that the dendrimer science is "one<br>
of the latest sciences", because it has been highlighted only<br>
since about the middle of the year 1990 and the number of the<br>
research on it has increased recently.<br>
As for the use of the dendritic molecules, there have been offered a variety of inventions on the subject of industrial use thereof, for example, their use in medicine and agricultural<br>
chemicals (JP-A Hei7-330631), use in solar cell and<br>
photosensitive material for electrophotography (JP-A<br>
Heill-40871), use in electronic material (JP-A Heill-171812),<br>
use in liquid crystal (JP-A 2000-264965), use in paint and ink<br>
(JP-A Heill-14018O), use in fluorescent resin sheet ( JP-A<br>
Heill-323324), use in qualitative and quantitative analyses<br>
(JP-A Heill-218494), use in biological response modifier (JP-C<br>
Hei8-510761), and so on.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide both<br>
novel dendritic molecules with useful functions and novel<br>
synthetic intermediates for producing them.<br>
More specifically, the main object of the present<br>
invention is to provide novel dendrimers which are useful as<br>
electronic material (for example, as the switch of memory) due<br>
to their ability to emit light from the core by transferring<br>
electron which exists in the branch structure into the core<br>
which has been made electron deficient by absorbing light or<br>
electric energy.<br>
Other objects of the present invention will become clear<br><br>
through the explanation hereinafter.<br>
The present inventors made an intensive investigation on<br>
the aforementioned problems and succeeded in creating the S atom<br>
containing dendrimers of the present invention.<br>
In addition, the present inventors have obtained a lot<br>
of novel knowledge about the dendrimers of the present invention<br>
which have many sulfur atom in their branch structures. Namely,<br>
in the case of the sulfur atom we can make use of their d-orbital<br>
electrons which do not exist in the oxygen atom. As the<br>
d-orbital electrons of the sulfur atom are placed farther apart<br>
from the nuclei than the p-orbital electrons of the oxygen atom,<br>
the electrons of the sulfur atom can move more freely than the<br>
electrons of the oxygen atom; the light or electric energy can<br>
be transferred to the core, which is in an electron-deficient<br>
state, with ease; it becomes possible to make the core emit light<br>
by constructing the core from a residue of a luminescent<br>
compound; and a larger polarization between the branch<br>
structure and the core can be obtained with the sulfur atoms<br>
than with the oxygen atoms. Consequently, the present<br>
inventors have got the knowledge that the dendrimers of the<br>
present invention are useful as an electronic material, for<br>
example, as the switch of memory.<br>
In addition, the present inventors have found that,<br>
although S atom-containing dendrimers can suffer deterioration<br>
due to oxidation, it is possible to make them more durable and<br>
of a long life by placing substituents with steric bulkiness,<br>
preferably t-butyl groups, on the outside of the branch<br>
structure, namely, at the opposite end across the branch<br>
structure from the core.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have found that the<br>
S atom-containing dendrimers of the present invention can be<br>
produced conveniently and industrially advantageously from a<br>
series of novel synthetic intermediates of specific structures. Based on a lot of novel knowledge mentionedabove, the<br>
present inventors have carried out an intensive investigation<br>

In the present invention, as the examples of the homo-<br>
or heterocyclic six-membered ring, there can specifically be<br>

diazine rings (for example, apyridazine ring, a pyrimidine ring,<br>
a pyrazine ring), and so on.<br>
As the surface functional group, there can specifically<br>
be mentioned a t-butyl group, CONH(CH2)2N+(CH3)3, and alkoxy<br>
groups including the methoxy group, and so on, the t-butyl group,<br>
however, being the most preferred one in the present invention.<br>
As the alkyl groups, there can be mentioned those, which<br>
may be straight or branched, of, favorably, the carbon number<br>
of C1-4, exemplified specifically by methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl and t-butyl, and so on.<br>
As the aralkyl groups, there can be mentioned benzyl and<br>
phenethyl, and so on. As the alkoxy groups, there can be<br>
mentioned those, which may be straight or branched, of,<br>
favorably, the carbon number of C1-4, exemplified specifically<br>
by a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, an i-propoxy group and a<br>
t-butoxy group, and so on.<br>
As the color developing functional groups, those groups,<br>
which may be known per se and can be derived, specifically, from<br><br>
rhodamine pigments, quinazoline, perylene, and azo-compounds,<br>
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester, porphyrins,<br>
4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl or 1-(4.4',4"-trihydroxyphenyl)ethane,<br>
are favorably used.<br>
Although those synthetic intermediates mentioned in [10]<br>
to [14] are novel compounds, they can be manufactured with ease<br>
according to the methods known per se, as exemplified hereunder.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br><br>
Next, by using the synthetic intermediates obtained above,<br>
the dendrimers of the present invention are produced. In the<br>
production, either of the two procedures, known per se: a<br>
divergent synthetic method, in which the central core inside,<br>
the branch structure outside, and the outermost surface<br><br>
functional groups are constructed successively in this order,<br>
or a convergent synthetic method, in which the outermost surface<br>
functional groups, the branch structure inside and the core at<br>
center are constructed successively in this order.<br>
Thus, both the compounds and dendrimers of the present<br>
invention shown hereunder can be produced.<br><br><br>
By repeating the procedure mentioned above, a dendrimer<br>
of higher generation shown hereunder can be produced.<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention is illustrated in more detail by reference<br>
to the following examples.However the present embodiments<br><br>
are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive. Hereunder, the reactions related to the<br>
following examples are illustrated in reaction schemes, wherein<br>
Ex. means example.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
By the same method, following compounds are produced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following is a specific explanation of the use of the<br>
compounds of the present invention referring to an illustration.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the layer structure of a<br>
single electron tunneling device of the present invention. In<br>
the present invention, a single-electron tunneling device is<br>
constructed by depositing on a substrate layers 1 of a lower<br>
electrode 2, a lower polylmide LB film layer 3, an intermediary<br>
electrode layer 4, an upper polylmide LB film layer 5, and an<br>
upper electrode 6 layer by layer.<br>
As the material used for the substrate, various materials<br>
which are in general use as the substrate of electronic<br>
component, such as metals, glasses, chinaware, ceramics and<br>
plastics, and so on, can be used without any particular<br>
restriction, and as the material for the lower electrode 2 and<br>
upper electrode 6, there can be used thin films of metals such<br><br>
as gold, silver and copper, and so on.<br>
On the lower electrode 2, the lower polylmide LB film layer<br>
3 is deposited. In the present invention, the term "polylmide<br>
LB film" means either a monomolecular film of polylmide or a<br>
built-up film thereof, made by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique.<br>
In the single electron tunneling device of the present invention,<br>
the polylmide LB film layer 3 can be constructed by laminating<br>
13 to 30 monomolecular films.<br>
As the polylmide consisting polylmide LB films, polylmide<br>
of a variety of structures can be used. Among them, those which<br>
has the repeating structural unit represented by Formula 25 are<br>
preferably used, because with them, it becomes possible to<br>
control the thickness of the monomolecular film to be prepared.<br>
Here, in the preparation of the polylmide LB film layer 3, it<br>
is preferable to prepare the layer by first depositing the<br>
precursor polyamidic acid monomolecular films and then by<br>
performing imidation by means of appropriate chemical<br>
processes.<br><br>
Next, the intermediary electrode layer 4, a monomolecular<br>
polylmide LB film layer in which the dendritic molecules of the<br>
present invention are incorporated, is formed on the polylmide<br>
LB film layer 3. In this case, it is necessary to get the<br>
polylmide LB film containing an adequate concentration (0.01<br><br>
to 1%) of the dendritic molecule of the present invention, in<br>
order to make the dendritic molecule function as an intermediary<br>
electrode. On the intermediary electrode layer 4, the upper<br>
polylmide LB film layer 5 is formed in a manner similar to the<br>
formation of the lower polylmide layer 3. This polylmide LB<br>
film layer 5 is constructed by depositing 20 to 30 layers of<br>
polylmide unimolecular films. By depositing the upper electrode<br>
6 on this upper polylmide LB film layer 5, a single electron<br>
tunneling device of the present invention is prepared. Thus,<br>
in this single electron tunneling device obtained, all the three<br>
layers which construct the electron tunneling layer, namely,<br>
the lower polylmide LB film layer 3, upper polylmide LB film<br>
layer 5 and the intermediary electrode layer 4, are composed<br>
of organic molecular material made of polylmide LB films, which<br>
makes it possible for the device to express a good single<br>
electron tunneling conductivity characteristic.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Production of Methyl 3,5-dimethylthiobenzoate.<br><br>
Methyl 3,5-bis(dlmethylcarbamoylthio)benzoate (20g)<br>
was dissolved in 500ml of methanol with heating. To this,<br>
sodium methoxide (30g) was added in an atmosphere of nitrogen.<br><br>
After completion of the addition, the resulting mixture was then<br>
heated for one hour under reflux and cooled a little. To this,<br>
an excess amount of methyl iodide was added, and the resulting<br>
mixture was heated for three hours under reflux and then<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue thus<br>
obtained was purified by means of chromatography with<br>
chloroform, giving the objective compound. The yleld was 10.5g<br>
(79.3%). The melting point is 46oC.<br>
1H-NMR( δ ppm, CDC13, TMS): 2.5(6H,s), 3.9(3H,s), 7.2(lH,s),<br>
7.6(2H,s).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Production of 3,5-Dimethylthiobenzyl Bromide via<br>
3,5-Dlmethylthiobenzyl Alcohol<br><br>
In an atmosphere of nitrogen, sodium<br>
dihydrobis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminate (70% in toluene, 50g,<br>
0.17mol) was dissolved into dry tetrahydrofuran. To this, a<br>
solution of 22.8g of 3,5-dimethylthiobenzoate in 100ml<br>
tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise at 5 to 10oC , and the mixture<br><br>
obtained was stirred at the same temperatures for 6 hours. Then,<br>
the reaction mixture was added to a mixture of 50ml of<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1L of ice-water, followed<br>
by extraction with chloroform. The extract was purified by means<br>
of chromatography using chloroform as the developing solvent.<br>
The eluate was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure<br>
and the residue obtained was washed with petroleum ether, giving<br>
3,5 - dimethylthiobenzyl bromide. The yleld was 21.6g (82%). The<br>
melting point is 76-77°C.<br>

EXAMPLE 27<br>
The present invention is illustrated in more detail by<br>
reference to the following example. However, the present<br>
embodiment is to be considered in all respect as illustrative<br>
and not restrictive.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 show schematic diagrams of a single electron<br>
tunneling device of the present invention. Fig.2 shows the<br>
horizontal projection (plan). Fig.3 a vertical cross-sectional<br>
view taken on line X-Y of Fig. 2, and Fig. 4 a magnified<br>
conceptual diagram of the junction part of the device. In Fig.<br>
3, the numeral 9 indicates the electron tunneling layer<br>
consisting of the lower polylmide LB film layer 3, the<br>
intermediary electrode 4 and the upper poluimide LB film 5.<br>
In this single electron tunneling device, a gold<br>
electrode being 100nm thick and free from a surface oxide layer<br>
formation was formed on a glass substrate by the method of vacuum<br>
evaporation as the lower electrode. Next, on the lower electrode<br>
2, the lower polylmide LB film layer 3, consisting of 25<br>
polylmide LB films of the polylmide which has the degree of<br>
polymerization shown by Formula 25, was constructed by first<br>
depositing the layers of precursor by the Langmuir-Blodgett<br>
technique, followed by a chemical treatment. Then, by the<br>
procedure similar to that used for the preparation of the lower<br>
polylmide LB layer 3, the intermediary electrode 4 which<br>
consists of monomolecular layer of polylmide LB film containing<br><br>
dendritic molecules of the present invention was formed using<br>
a mixture of the polylmide of Formula 25 and the dendritic<br>
molecule of the present invention shown in Formula 24 in a ratio<br>
of 500:1. Molecular occupied area measurement showed that, in<br>
the intermediary electrode obtained, there were about 1000<br>
molecules of the compound of Formula 24 in an area of about 1<br>
µ m square. This electrode functioned as an intermediary<br>
electrode effectively. On the intermediary electrode layer 4,<br>
in a manner similar to that of the lower polylmide LB film layer<br>
3, was deposited 30 layers of the polylmide precursor LB films,<br>
followed by lmldation with a chemical treatment, giving the<br>
upper polylmide LB film layer 5.<br>
Finally, on the upper LB film layer 5, the upper electrode<br>
6 and the upper reserve electrode 7 of gold having a thickness<br>
of 50-100nm and being free from a surface oxide layer formation<br>
were formed by the method of vacuum evaporation in the direction<br>
to cross the lower electrode 2, giving a single electron<br>
tunneling device. In the device of this EXAMPLE, the reserve<br>
upper electrode 7 was the additional one which was attached<br>
together with the upper electrode 6 for use to compare the<br>
characteristics of the device based on the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the edge of the lower electrode 2 was covered with<br>
an edge-covering layer 8 in order to prevent both the dielectric<br>
breakdown from the edge of the lower electrode 2 and the short<br>
circuit due to defects among the lower polylmide LB film layer<br>
3, the intermediary electrode layer 4 and the upper polylmide<br>
LB film layer 5. Consequently, following these procedures, a<br>
single electron tunneling device of the working area of 50x100<br>
square µm was prepared.<br><br>
With the single electron tunneling device prepared using<br>
the compound of the present invention, the electric current flow<br>
across the junction was measured by means of an ammeter 18 under<br>
applied step voltage 17 at a constant temperature in a cryostat.<br>
The measurement was carried out by the two-terminal network<br>
method, because the resistance between the lower electrode 2<br>
and the upper electrode 6 amounted to 100M to 10GΩ .<br>
Fig. 5 shows the I-V (current to voltage) characteristic<br>
measured at 5.2K. This Fig. shows clearly, although at a<br>
cryogenic temperature of 5.2K, an equally spaced voltage step<br>
structure characteristic of a single electron tunneling. It<br>
is known that the step width due to the single electron tunneling<br>
process uniformly equals to e/C, wherein C is the capacitance<br>
between the intermediary electrode 4 and the lower electrode<br>
2 or the upper electrode 6 and e is the electric charge of an<br>
electron. As Fig. 5 shows, the voltage step width is uniformly<br>
about 100mV, both in the zero and first orders, revealing<br>
clearly the characteristic of the single electron tunneling.<br>
