MEDIUM AND CULTURE OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No.<br>
60/608,040 filed September 8,2004<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0002]	This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the<br>
following agencies: NIH RR17721. The United States has certain rights in this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Stem cells are defined as cells that are capable of differentiation into many other<br>
differentiated cell types. Embryonic stem cells are stem cells from embryos which are capable of differentiation into most, if not all, of the differentiated cell types of a mature body. Stem cells are referred to as pluripotent, which describes this capability of differentiating into many cell types. A category of pluripotent stem cell of high interest to the research community is the human embryonic stem cell, abbreviated here as human ES cell, which is an embryonic stem cell derived from a human embryonic source. Human embryonic stem cells are of great scientific interest because they are capable of indefinite proliferation in culture and are thus capable, at least in principle, of supplying cells and tissues for replacement of failing or defective human tissue. The existence in culture of human embryonic stem cells offers the potential of unlimited amounts of human cells and tissues for use in a variety of therapeutic protocols to assist in human health. It is envisioned in the future human embryonic stem cells will be proliferated and directed to differentiate into specific lineages so as to develop differentiated cells or tissues which can be transplanted into human bodies for therapeutic purposes. Human embryonic stem cells and the differentiated cells that maybe derived from them are also powerful scientific tools for the study of human cellular and developmental systems.<br>
[0004]	The basic techniques to create and culture human embryonic stem cells have been<br>
described. The previously reported techniques do work, but there are limitations and drawbacks to many of the procedures currently used to culture human embryonic stem cells. One limitation is of particular concern. Most existing human embryonic stem cell lines have been, to one degree or another, exposed directly to mouse cells or to a medium in which mouse cells have been cultured previously. The fact that some ES cells from existing cell lines were found to exhibit the sialic residue NeuSGc, which is not normally made by human cells, received much attention<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/029197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
in the press. The original techniques for the generation and culture of human embryonic stem cells required the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast (M.EF) feeder cells as a feeder layer on which human embryonic stem cells could be cultured. The fibroblast feeder cells acts, through some as yet incompletely understood mechanism, to encourage the stem cells to remain in an undifferentiated state- Later, it was discovered that the same phenomenon could be achieved if the stern cells were exposed to "conditioned media." Conditioned medium is a stem cell culture medium with which feeder cells, such as MEFs, had been previously been cultured. Either the feeder cells imparted some factor to the medium or removed some factor from the medium, but the result is that conditioned medium can be used to culture stem cells without differentiation. Either culture condition, the direct growth of human ES on murine feeder cells, or the use of conditioned media, raises the concern that one or more agents such as a virus could transmit from the mouse cells to the human ES cells. If one of the objectives of human embryonic stem cell cultures is to create tissues which can ultimately be transplanted into a human body, it is highly desirable that the stem cells never have been exposed to cells of another species or to media which have been used to culture cells of another species. Accordingly, defining a culture condition, which will permit the proliferation and culture of human embryonic stem cells without a fibroblast feeder layer, is of great interest in the continued development of techniques for the long term culture of toman embryonic stem cells.<br>
[0005]	A characteristic trait of human embryonic stem cells in culture is that if conditions<br>
are less than ideal, the cells have a tendency to differentiate. It is easy to induce human ES cells<br>
to differentiate while it is demanding to maintain the human ES cells in undifferentiatcd state in<br>
culture. Most culture conditions will results in. some level of unwanted differentiation,<br>
particularly around the periphery of the growing ES cell colony. While ES cells can be cultured<br>
with some degree of unwanted differentiation, the objective is to define a culture condition that<br>
permits the culture to remain as undifferentiaied as possible, i.e. with as few differentiated cells<br>
as possible. We believe that we have used particularly stringent standards to define conditions<br>
that will support the indefinite culture of undifferentiated ES cell cultures.<br>
[0006]	Several medium formulations will permit human ES cells to remain<br>
imdifferentiated for some time, but that state often fails to maintain itself. In particular, we define the growth of human ES cells from an initial seed culture in a culture vessel to confluence in the same culture vessel as a "passage," We have found several medium formulations that permit the cultivation of human ES cells for one or two passages without severe differentiation, but then the cells differentiate rapidly upon subsequent passages, We have come to believe that in order for a medium to truly support the indefinite proliferation of human ES cells without<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/029197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
differentiation, without conditioned medium or fibroblast feeder cells, the medium must be demonstrated to support culture of human ES cells in a substantially uniform and uiidifferentiated state for at least five passages. It is also important that the cultures remain relatively homogenous and undifferentiated throughout the culture period and retain all of the important characteristics of human ES cells.<br>
[0007]	The state of differentiation of a stem cell culture can be assessed most easily by<br>
judging the morphological characteristics, of the cells. Undifferentiated stem cells have a characteristic morphology, i.e. small and compact cells with clearly defined cell borders, a morphology wliich can be easily seen by examination of a stem cell culture under a microscope, By contrast, cells which have differentiated appear larger and more diffuse, with indistinct borders. While some differentiated cells can, and normally do, appear at the margin of colonies of undifferentiated cells, the optimal stem cell culture is one that proliferates in the culture vessel with only minimal numbers of cells at the periphery of the culture appealing to be differentiated. With experience, one can judge the status of differentiation and health of human ES cell cultures visually with good accuracy. A biochemical marker that is used to track the status of ES cells as undiffereniiated is the presence of the transcription factor Oct4. which lias come to be regarded as the most reliable marker of undifferentiated status of ES cells, and which is one of the first markers lost as undilTerentiaied cells begin to differentiate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00017]	We have identified multiple culture conditions and media which permit the<br>
indefinite culture and robust proliferation of human embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state and also in the absence of both feeder cells and conditioned medium. The development of these media and culture conditions make possible the derivation and maintenance of human ES cell lines in defined and controlled conditions without direct or indirect exposure to animal cells of any kind. These media have been demonstrated to support undifferentiated ES cell proliferation through multiple passages, at least five, which is firm evidence that these media will support such cultures indefinitely.<br>
[00018]	A defined and humanized medium for the culture and proliferation of human ES<br>
cells typically includes salts, vitamins, a source of glucose, minerals and amino acids. To supplement the medium and supply conditions to support cell growth, initially stem cell media included serum from one source or another. Also previously, it has been reported that the addition of fibroblast growth factor plus a serum replacement additive will permit the cultivation of human ES cells without serum. The serum replacement can be a commercially available product sold for that purpose or can be a formulated mixture of protein, such as serum albumin,<br>
_4_<br><br>
WO 2006/029197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
vitamins, salts, minerals, a transferrin or transfcrrin substitute, and insulin or an insulin substitute. This serum replacement component may also be supplemented with selenium. It is preferred here that a defined serum replacement be used in lieu of serum from any source in cul hiring<br>
human ES cells, in order to avoid the issues of variation, in serum constituents and to use media<br>
that are as defined as possible. We have defined a sufficient medium, and all of the components<br>
of the medium taught here are disclosed in Table 1 set forth below, which lists all the<br>
components of our medium, designated TeSRl, by concentration of the constituents. The TeSRl<br>
medium is comprised of a DMEM/DF12 base, supplemented with human serum, albumin,<br>
vitamins, antioxidants, trace minerals, specific lipids, and cloned growth factors,<br>
[00019]	To avoid the need for a fibroblast feeder layer, previously thought to be necessary<br>
to maintain human ES cells in an undifferentiated state, it is reported here thai the combination of the use of higher concentrations of FGF (10 to 1000 ng/ml) together with the use of GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid), pipecholic acid (PA), lithium (LiCl) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), will enable a medium to support undifferentisted stem cell growth, The combination of these additives has been found to be sufficient to maintain the culture of human ES cells in an undifferentiated state indefinitely without exposure to either feeder cells or conditioned media. These additives are demonstrably sufficient. However, all of them may not be necessary for every medium formulation. By selective deletion of these additives, one or more of these components can be deleted resulting in human ES cell cultures that will still grow at a loss of purity of undifferentiated. status in the cultures. Such cultures may or may not remain stable over many passages. However, it is clear that the combination is sufficient to enable a variety of media that will support the long term culture and proliferation of undifferentiated human ES cells through an indefinite number of passages without feeder cells or conditioned medium.<br>
[00020]	Our initial subjective screens of these individual growth factors, chosen because<br>
of the receptors expressed fay human ES cells, identified several factors as having positive effects on undifferentiated proliferation. Of these, bFGF, LiCl, 'y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pipecholic acid, and TGF#b were ultimately included in TeSRl, For each of the four cell lines tested, the proliferation rate and the percentage of calls maintaining expression of characteristic human ES cell markers were higher in TeSRl than in control cells cultured in fibroblast-conditioned medium, and removal of any one of these five factors decreased culture performance. Some of these data are illustrated in Fig. 1 , which shows that cultures grown in media with any one of these constituents omitted exhibited a lesser percentage of cells which remained undifferentiated as compared to cultures with all four of these medium constituents included. Note that Oct4,<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2006/029197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
SSEA-l, SSEA-4, Tral-60 and Tral-SO are all cell surface markers or transcription factors<br>
(Oct4) which are used to track the differentiation status of stem cells. Fig 4 illustrates similar<br>
trials in which it was demonstrated that over multiple passages the growth rate of the cultures<br>
was the highest when all these constituents together were in the culture medium.<br>
[00021]	It is also helpful to include in the culture conditions for the human ES cells a<br>
biological matrix in the culture vessel. One such material that has been used is Matrigel (tm), which is an artificial basement membrane of mouse cell origin, which is supplied as a commercial product free of mouse cells. Another material of human origin also known now to serve a similar purpose is fibronectin, a human giycoprotein which h sd in its insoluble form to create a fiber matrix also to serve as a basement membrane for ES cell culture. In our hands a matrix of fibronectin alone was not sufficient. However, it has also now been found that a hitman matrix material can be made of a combination of the human matrix proteins collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin and this matrix suffices to support human ES cells indefinitely in an uodifferentiated state in the TeSRl medium.<br>
[00022]	Arriving at the above listed medium additives followed the methodical testing of<br>
over 80 individual growth factors. While some of the additives seemed, at least for a few<br>
passages, to support in the growth of human ES cells in culture, many failed in subsequent<br>
passages to maintain the ES cells in an tindtfferentiated state. We were did not identify other<br>
combinations of these factors which gave the results of the media additives described in the<br>
examples below. This is not to say the constituents are not subject to some variation. For<br>
example, the LiCl is used in the medium because it stimulates the wnt pathway. Wnts<br>
themselves or other stimulators of this pathway such as activin could be substituted as<br>
equivalents to LiCl, even though LiCl is the likely the most economical agent for this purpose.<br>
Similarly, the GABA is believed to interact with the GABA receptor; and the scientific literature<br>
includes the identification of several molecules which are agonists of that same receptor and<br>
might be substituted for GABA in the medium as an equivalent. It is also believed that PA also<br>
interacts with the GABA receptor. While both PA and GABA were found to be helpful in the<br>
medium at. the concentrations used here, it is also envisioned that one or the other of these<br>
constituents could be dramatically increased in concentration to obviate the need for the oilier.<br>
[00023]	The fibroblast growth factor in higher concentrations (40 to 100 ng/ral) seems to<br>
obviated the need for feeder cells. The preferred FGF is basic FGF, also referred to as bFGF and FGF2, but other FGFs including at least FGF4, FGF9, FGF17 and FGF18 will suffice for this purpose as well. Other FGFs may also work, even if at higher concentrations.<br>

WO 2006/O29197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
[00024]	The observation that human embryonic stem (ES) cell cultures have previously<br>
been maintained In an un differentiated state only when cultured in the presence of fibroblast<br>
feeder cells or in conditioned medium has led to speculation that the fibroblasts release into the<br>
medium a factor which acts to inhibit differentiation of the ES cells. However, whatever effect<br>
that is mediated by the fibroblast feeder cells to the medium, it is now clear that the medium<br>
described below will substitute for that effect. The three media defined below are defined,<br>
contain no animal cells, and permit the long term culture of undifferentiated human ES cells in an<br>
undiffereiif iated state. An example is also presented of a medium in which the proteins in the<br>
medium are all human, to have a "humanized" medium and culture conditions to avoid any<br>
possible concerns about sob-cellular products of animal origin.<br>
[00025]	EXAMPLES<br>
[00026]	The constituents of TeSRl medium, which was used for all cultures described<br>
here unless otherwise indicated, is set forth in Table 1 below. Our preliminary experiments suggested that undifferenfiated human ES cell proliferation was optimal at a pH of 7.2, an osmoiarity of 350 niOsMol, and an atmosphere of 10%CO2/5%O2 These conditions were used for all subsequent cultures described here.<br>
[00027]	Cells of human. ES lines HI, H7, H9, and H14 cells have all proliferated robustly<br>
in TeSRl for 11,7.25, and 17 passages respectively (2-6 months). The karyotypes were continued normal for cell line HI4 after 7 passages, and H9 after 8 and 21 passages. Teratoma formation was confirmed for HI and H9 after 11 and 20 passages.<br>
[00028]	It has been suggested that prior ES cell cultures are less than optimal because of<br>
the presence of NeuSGc, a sialtc acid not made by humans. Because the human matrix<br>
components collagen, tibronectin, laminin and viteonectm eliminated the final animal product<br>
from the TeSRl culture conditions for human ES cells, we tested whether NeuSGc was<br>
eliminated from existing human ES cell lines during culture in. this medium. We confirmed the<br>
presence of NeuSGc on human ES cells cultured in fibroblast conditioned medium, detected a<br>
reduced but detectable amount on cells cultured in TeSRl on Matrigel, and could not detect any<br>
NeuSGc on ES cells cultured in TeSRl using the four human matrix components* These data are<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus human ES cells cultured on. TeSR I and on a matrix of human proteins<br>
do not exhibit the non-human sialic acid residues found in cells cultured on murine feeder cells,<br>
[00029]	To test the conditions of the ES cell colonies and the suitability of the culture for<br>
the long term maintenance of human ES cell cultures, the TeSRl medium was compared to the<br>
best prior medium condition, which in ours hands is the use of conditioned medium. It was<br>
found that the TeSRl medium was capable of maintaining the human ES cells in such an	:<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/O29197	PCT/US2005/031838<br>
undifferentiated state thai over 90% of the cells continued to test positive for Oct. 4 even after long term culture. The results of this test are presented in the graph of Fig, 3. This represents the first instance known in which any feeder free and conditioned medium free medium has maintained a level of undifferentiated growth of human ES cells to die extent that over 90% of die cells a the culture remain imdifftreriiiaied at all stages.<br>
[00030]	The growth curve and EACS analysis of HI cells cultured for 3 passages was<br>
measured in TeSRi medium and in TeSR medium from which each the following components had been omitted: TGFft PA} LiCl, GABA and bFGF. To start the cultures, 3 X 10s cells from each cell line were plated on Day 0 of passage 1. Cell numbers were counted from triplicate wells to assess attachment (clay 2-3) and final cell number at passage (day 6-7). Initial plating density and sampling times were repeated, when possible, for 5 passages. Cells were analyzed on day 6 of passage 3 by FACS for cell surface markers SSEA1, SSEA4, Tra 1-60 and Tra 1-81 and for the transcription factor Oct4. This data is presented graphically in Fig, 1. These data show that human ES cells can be cultured in media lacking each of these components at the cost of some unwanted differentiation of cells in the culture, and that the highest level of undifferentiated culture could only be achieved by using all of these components. Similar results were obtained with other cells lines as well.<br>
[00031]	The pluripotency of human ES cell lines maintained in TeSRl medium was tested.<br>
Cells of.newly initiated cell lines WA01 and WA09, cultured in ToSRl Medium on Matrigel matrix for 11 and 20 passages, respectively were injected into SCID-beige mice, Teraiomas exhibiting complex differentiation developed in the mice 6-8 weeks post-inoculation.<br>

13.	A culture of human embryonic stem cells comprising undifferentiated human stem<br>
cells, a matrix and a culture medium, the culture free of feeder cells or medium exposed to feeder<br>
cells, the medium also free of products from non-human animals, the human embryonic stem<br>
cells proliferating in an undifferentiated state and being at least 90% positive for the transcription<br>
factor Oct4 through prolonged culture.<br>
1.4. A culture of human embryonic stem cells as claimed in claim 13 wherein the cells do not exhibit the sialic acid residue NeuSGc.<br>
15. A medium for culturing stem cells, the medium comprising salts, vitamins, amino<br>
acids, glucose, a fibroblast growth factor, gamma amino butyric acid, pipecholic acid, lithium<br>
and transforming growth factor beta in. sufficient amounts to maintain stem cells grown in the<br>
medium in an undifferentiated state through multiple culture passages,<br>
16. The medium of claim 15, wherein the medium further comprises proteins selected<br>
from the group consisting of albumin, insulin and transferrin.<br><br>
 -12-<br>
Previous methods for culturing human embryonic stem cells have required either fibroblast feeder cells or a medium which has been exposed to fibroblast feeder cells in order to maintain the stem cells in an undifferntiated state. It has now been found that if high levels of fibroblast growth factor, gamma amino butyric acid, pipecholic acid, lithium and transforming growth factor beta are added to the medium in which the stem cells are cultured, the stem cells will remain undifferntiated indefinitely through multiple passages, even without feeder cells or conditioned medium.<br></td>
