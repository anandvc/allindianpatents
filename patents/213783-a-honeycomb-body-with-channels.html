				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a honeycomb body with channels.<br>
The present invention is a honeycomb body with absorber material, in particular for a so-<br>
called hydrocarbon trap (HC trap), preferably in the exhaust emission control system of a<br>
motor vehicle.<br>
As the emission control requirements which motor vehicles have to meet become<br>
increasingly more stringent worldwide, particular attention is being paid to cleaning the<br>
exhaust gas in the cold-starting phase of an internal combustion engine. The reason for<br>
this is that relatively large quantities of unburned hydrocarbons are present in the exhaust<br>
gas immediately after an internal combustion engine is started, while at the same time<br>
catalytic converters in the exhaust emission control system are not yet at a sufficiently<br>
high temperature for the catalytic conversion of these hydrocarbons. One solution for<br>
reducing the emission of hydrocarbons in particular during the cold-starting phase of an<br>
internal combustion engine, is the use of an HC trap. An HC trap is generally a<br>
honeycomb body with channels through which a gas can pass and which are separated at<br>
least partly from one another by separating walls, the honeycomb body being coated with<br>
an absorber material, preferably zeolite, which absorbs hydrocarbons at a low<br>
temperature and desorbs them again at a higher temperature. Typically, such HC traps are<br>
arranged upstream of a catalytic converter. An example of this is known, for example,<br>
from EP 0 582 971 Bl. EP 0 424 966 Al also describes such a system, the HC trap<br>
additionally being bridged at the end of the cold-starting phase by a bypass line in order<br>
to avoid overheating in continuos operation. What is<br><br>
said here may also be of significance in the case of adsorbers<br>
for other constituents of the exhaust gas, for example<br>
nitrogen oxides or water.<br>
All previous concepts for the construction and arrangement of<br>
an HC trap must allow for the fact that there has in the past<br>
been scarcely any adsorber materials which are durable on a<br>
long-term basis in the exhaust system of an internal<br>
combustion engine and at the same time have a desorption<br>
temperature which lies above the minimum temperature necessary<br>
for a catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. For this reason,<br>
the previously known concepts assume that an HC trap should<br>
have a high specific thermal capacity, in particular a higher<br>
thermal capacity than a downstream catalytic reactor, in order<br>
that the catalytic reactor can heat up to the minimum<br>
temperature necessary for the catalytic reaction before the<br>
desorption in the HC trap begins. This concept is described in<br>
particular also by EP 0 582 971 Bl.<br>
In spite of this, the problem remains that the HC trap draws<br>
heat from the exhaust gas in the cold-starting phase and, as a<br>
result, in any event delays the time taken by a downstream<br>
catalytic converter to reach the minimum temperature necessary<br>
for the catalytic reaction, so that it is always difficult to<br>
find a compromise for dimensioning an HC trap and a downstream<br>
catalytic converter.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a honeycomb<br>
body with adsorber material, in particular for hydrocarbons,<br>
which permits improved cleaning of the exhaust gas of an<br>
internal combustion engine, in particular in the cold-starting<br>
phase.<br><br>
Serving to achieve this object, according to claim 1, is a<br>
honeycomb body with channels through which a gas can pass and<br>
the inner cross-sectional shape and number of which define a<br>
specific geometrical surface area (GSA), measured in m2/l, of<br>
the honeycomb body, and which are separated at least partly<br>
from one another by separating walls, the material and<br>
thickness of the separating walls defining a specific thermal<br>
capacity (cp) in relation to the geometrical surface area,<br>
measured in kJ/(K-m2) of the honeycomb body, the honeycomb<br>
body further having an adsorber material, in particular for<br>
hydrocarbons, and the specific geometrical surface area (GSA)<br>
of the honeycomb body divided by the surface-area-related<br>
specific thermal capacity (cp), measured at room temperature<br>
and without adsorber material and without any other coatings,<br>
further being greater than or equal to 37.5 m-K/J<br>
(meters-Kelvin/Joule), preferably greater than or equal to 40,<br>
in particular greater than or equal to 60.<br>
The thermal capacity of a material is dependent on the<br>
temperature of the material and, in the case of exhaust<br>
emission control systems, is often considered and specified<br>
for relatively high temperature ranges. For the function of an<br>
adsorber, in particular an HC trap, however, the temperature<br>
range below 350 °C is decisive, for which reason the figures<br>
specified in the present case are related to room temperature,<br>
that is 20 °C. The specific thermal capacity in the sense<br>
defined here is in this case the thermal capacity in relation<br>
to a unit of geometrical surface area of the honeycomb body,<br>
that is a value dependent on the wall thickness and porosity<br>
of the separating walls and material.<br>
Previous considerations assumed that an HC trap should not<br>
reach the desorption temperature, at which the desorption of .<br>
hydrocarbons begins, before a downstream catalytic converter<br><br>
has reached a minimum temperature necessary for the catalytic<br>
conversion. However, this consideration does not take into<br>
account the fact that, when the necessary minimum temperature<br>
is reached, the catalytic conversion brings about the complete<br>
conversion of all hydrocarbons very quickly, since, even if it<br>
reaches the necessary minimum temperature only at one point, a<br>
catalytic converter completely heats up further almost<br>
abruptly because of the exothermal reaction then taking place<br>
and, as it does so, catalytically converts all the<br>
hydrocarbons flowing onto it. By contrast with this, the<br>
desorption in an HC trap proceeds very slowly, so that even<br>
when the desorption temperature is reached and after it is<br>
exceeded, the stored hydrocarbon is released only gradually.<br>
By contrast with the technical teaching in the past, this<br>
realization, found after calculations and tests, leads to an<br>
HC trap with as low a thermal capacity as possible and as<br>
large a geometrical surface area as possible being preferred,<br>
a ratio between the specific geometrical surface area and<br>
surface-area-related specific thermal capacity, measured at<br>
room temperature and without adsorber material and without any<br>
other coatings, of greater than or equal to 4 0 m-K/J having<br>
been found to be favorable. Preferred even is a still greater<br>
ratio of greater than or equal to 60. In the case of such an<br>
arrangement, although the HC trap heats up relatively quickly<br>
in the exhaust gas flow during the cold-starting phase, and<br>
gradually begins the deaorption of hydrocarbons, a downstream<br>
catalytic converter can also heat up more quickly, and<br>
consequently reach its minimum temperature necessary for the<br>
catalytic reaction more quickly, because the HC trap draws<br>
increasingly less heat from the exhaust gas flow as it heats<br>
up more and more. This has the overall effect that<br>
hydrocarbons are converted already at a very early stage in<br>
the cold-starting phase and the emission of pollutants can be<br>
lowered. The solution according to the invention also has<br><br>
advantages for the dimensioning of an HC trap, since rapid<br>
kicking off of the catalytic reaction allows a smaller storage<br>
volume for the HC trap.<br>
A particularly advantageous aspect of the invention is<br>
obtained if the honeycomb body itself additionally has a<br>
catalytically active coating, which has at least an oxidizing<br>
effect. Then, as soon as the minimum temperature necessary for<br>
this is achieved, the desorbed hydrocarbons can be<br>
catalytically converted immediately on this coating. In this<br>
respect, tests show that the temperature of the honeycomb body<br>
rises immediately at the beginning of the conversion due to<br>
the exothermal reaction, whereby the desorption process and<br>
the conversion are speeded up. This is of advantage in<br>
particular if a motor vehicle is frequently operated over<br>
short distances, since the HC trap is very quickly fully<br>
regenerated again and ready for taking up hydrocarbons during<br>
the next cold start.<br>
In the dimensioning of a honeycomb body according to the<br>
invention, numerous factors play a role, inter alia the<br>
overall volume of the honeycomb body, the ratio of axial<br>
length and cross-sectional surface area and the placement in<br>
the exhaust system. Independently of this, however, it has<br>
been found that an increase in the specific geometrical<br>
surface area of the honeycomb body is generally favorable,<br>
which can mainly be achieved by increasing the number of<br>
channels per unit of cross-sectional surface area.<br>
Particularly favorable are therefore honeycomb bodies with<br>
over 360 channels per square inch (cpsi), preferably even over<br>
450 cpsi and in particular over 540 cpsi.<br>
Likewise favorable for a honeycomb body according to the<br>
invention is to design the separating walls in such a way that<br><br>
they have as low a thermal capacity as possible, which can be achieved essentially by<br>
reducing the thickness of the separating walls. For honeycomb bodies comprising layers<br>
of sheet metal, therefore, a thickness of less than or equal to 40 µm, preferably less than<br>
or equal to 30 urn is used. For ceramic honeycomb bodies, by analogy, the use of so-<br>
called thin-wall ceramic is particularly favorable.<br>
A honeycomb body according to the invention is preferably used in an exhaust emission<br>
control system of a motor vehicle, to be precise in conjunction with a downstream three-<br>
way catalytic converter. Configuration of known exhaust emission control systems may<br>
also be of advantage of application of the honeycomb body according to the invention, in<br>
particular a bypass line which can be controlled in dependence on the operating state<br>
and/or electrical means of heating the honeycomb body or a downstream three-way<br>
catalytic converter.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is schematically represented in the<br>
accompanying drawing. The honeycomb body 1 according to the invention, serving as an<br>
HC trap, has channels 2, which are separated from one another by separating walls 3.<br>
Such a honeycomb body 1 may be arranged in particular in an exhaust system 5 of a<br>
motor vehicle, being arranged upstream of the three-way catalytic converter 4. In the<br>
cold-starting phase, the exhaust gas, becoming slowly hotter, initially flows through the<br>
honeycomb 1, with virtually all the hydrocarbons contained in the exhaust gas being<br>
absorbed by a coating for the adsorption of hydrocarbons, in particular a zeolite coating,<br>
on the separating walls 3. The exhaust gas subsequently flows through the three-way<br>
catalytic converter 4. On account of the favorable ratio, according to the invention, of the<br>
geometrical surface area and thermal capacity of the honeycomb body 1 per unit of<br>
surface area, the<br><br>
time period in which the honeycomb body 1 ie already desorbing<br>
hydrocarbons but the three-way catalytic converter 4 cannot<br>
yet convert them is very short. This is followed almost<br>
abruptly by a complete conversion of all the hydrocarbons<br>
contained and desorbed in the exhaust gas, so that altogether<br>
the emission of hydrocarbons is less than in the case of<br>
conventional systems. This process may be further assisted if<br>
the honeycomb body 1 additionally has a catalytically active<br>
coating, speeding up at least the oxidation.<br>
A honeycomb body according to the invention is suitable in<br>
particular for use in exhaust emission control systems of<br>
motor vehicles which are to meet the most stringent<br>
requirements for environmental compatibility.<br><br>
