METHOD FOR REUSING RECORDING MEDIUM, REUSABLE<br>
RECORDING MEDIUM, METHOD FOR PRODUCING REUSABLE<br>
RECORDING MEDIUM AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods for reusing recording<br>
media in repeated sequential processes of image forming and erasing,<br>
reusable recording media suited to the methods, methods for producing<br>
the reusable recording media and image forming apparatuses with a<br>
control unit to feed the recording media.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, printers, analogue copiers, digital copiers and<br>
printing machines on the basis of electrophotographic, ink-jet or thermal<br>
transfer processes have been widely popularized, thus extremely great<br>
amounts of paper have been consumed for recording media. The paper,<br>
which being typically used for the recording media, is made of renewable<br>
pulp produced from wood.<br>
However, large amounts of energy are consumed in various paper<br>
producing steps such as pulping steps to extract cellulose fibers from<br>
wood and paper-drying steps to dry the resultant paper. A part of these<br>
steps have been innovated to reduce CO2 amount by way of making use of<br>
biofuels such as black liquor, which being a pulp-extract residual matter,<br><br>
in place of fossil fuels; however, all of these steps cannot make use of such<br>
biofuels.<br>
CO2 gas emitted from fossil fuels is believed to cause warming of<br>
earth, and also depletion of fossil fuel sources and environmental<br>
protection are serious problems, which demand to reduce the consumed<br>
quantity of paper. Saving of fuel may lead to an effective fuel utilized for<br>
other than paper production, even when the fuel being a biofuel.<br>
Recently, destructive lumbering for paper making seems to be on a<br>
decline, however, all of paper cannot be of wood from well-controlled<br>
forests; thus it is an important social problem to protect forests and to<br>
prevent deterioration of global environment through suppressing the<br>
consumed amount of paper.<br>
In addition, paper typically contains inorganic ingredients free<br>
from burnout and decay, thus disposed paper generates waste product to<br>
be landfilled in a certain rate. However, places for waste products are<br>
definitely limited and restricted, thus the reduction of consumed amount<br>
of paper is desired also from the viewpoint of such a social issue.<br>
In order to address these problems, paper has been conventionally<br>
reused in a way, for example, that used information recording paper is<br>
collected, the collected paper is decomposed once into pulp in paper<br>
making plants and then reproduced into paper.<br>
However, these processes require approximately equivalent<br>
energy with those starting from fresh pulp since other energy is necessary<br><br>
for collecting/transporting, repulping and paper making even though new<br>
wood source being unnecessary.<br>
In addition, the rate of recycled pulp is typically limited to about<br>
30% for high-quality paper of information recording paper in order to<br>
prevent such quality problems as low stiffness, less whiteness and<br>
bleeding at printing.<br>
As such, it is necessary in order to produce high-quality<br>
information-recording paper with higher whiteness that the rate of<br>
recycled pulp is limited and the pulp is produced from recycled waste<br>
paper, which possibly resulting in a cost higher than that of the processes<br>
from fresh wood in some cases. Furthermore, collection and<br>
regeneration of recording media with recorded information may cause<br>
problems in terms of preservation of secret and privacy since the<br>
recording media with recorded information are put into circulation from<br>
offices or houses.<br>
In order to address these problems, various processes are<br>
proposed to reuse recording media in a way that images, on once-used<br>
recording media, are erased to generate the recording media. For<br>
example, such a process is proposed that a plastic, metal, paper with no<br>
liquid-permeability, or ceramics is employed as the recording medium,<br>
then a hot-melting peeler is interposed between hot-melting images and<br>
the recording medium, and the images are peeled away through heating<br>
the hot-melting peeler (e.g. see Patent Literature 1). An image erasing<br>
apparatus is proposed in which images, formed on a recording medium<br><br>
treated with, a release agent, are transferred and peeled away by use of an<br>
endless belt having a hot-melting resin on the surface (e.g. see Patent<br>
Literature 2). An erasable paper is proposed in which images on a sheet<br>
or regular paper, prepared by coating and drying a silicone sealing agent<br>
on a coat paper, is removed through attaching and peeling a tape (e.g. see<br>
Patent Literature 3). Patent Literature 3 describes an erasable paper<br>
with a mark or an expression for mechanically distinguishing from<br>
regular paper, in order to prevent erroneous disposal due to confusion<br>
between the erasable paper and regular paper or to avoid erroneous<br>
treatment of regular paper with image erasing devices, in which the mark<br>
may be applied by printing or handwriting and the expression may<br>
display to be erasable by means of perforations.<br>
The recording media, described in the Patent Literatures, have a<br>
base material formed of plastics, contain a silicone sealing material as an<br>
image-repellent agent, or utilize a commercially available adhesive tape.<br>
In cases of recording media having a base material formed of plastics,<br>
users are occasionally beaten by an electrical shock since the materials<br>
tend to accumulate electrical charge during transferring steps in<br>
electrophotographic processes and the electrical charge hardly dissipates<br>
from the materials even after the transferring. In addition, plastics are<br>
typically more expensive than paper.<br>
Patent Reference 4 etc. a utilization of silicone compounds for an<br>
image-repellent agent in order to make easy the image removed. It will<br>
be certain that the silicone compounds in the recording media make easy<br><br>
to remove images formed on the recording media by transfer with heat<br>
and pressure, even without coating a repellant agent on the recording<br>
media.<br>
However, silicone compounds are considerably expensive, thus the<br>
recording media containing silicone compounds as the image -repellent<br>
agent will suffer from higher production cost. Furthermore, silicone<br>
compounds typically decrease image-fixing ability excessively, thus there<br>
may arise such problems that image-quality degrade due to offset at<br>
image formation, image-forming materials drop out from the recording<br>
media in use, which making images illegible and/or polluting the<br>
surround. In addition, it is difficult to record onto recording media, on<br>
which silicone compounds being coated, by use of water-based pens or oil<br>
pens; it is difficult to coat aqueous liquids since silicone compounds are<br>
not water-soluble.<br>
The present inventors et al. have proposed a reusable recording<br>
medium comprising an image-repellent agent of acrylic ester or<br>
methacrylic ester polymers having fluorinated alkyl groups (e.g. see<br>
Patent Literature 3). However, employment of fluorinated polymers<br>
possibly suffers from similar problems as those of silicone; that is,<br>
fluorine compounds are likely to be expensive, which makes the cost of<br>
recording media higher. The fluorocarbon compounds typically provide<br>
excessive image-repellent effect, thus it is difficult to control fixing ability<br>
of image forming materials onto recording media, more specifically, it is<br>
difficult to assure fixing ability of recording media since fluorocarbon<br><br>
resins tend to excessively decrease the fixing ability of image forming<br>
materials and/or it is difficult to record onto recording media by use of<br>
water-based pens or oil pens. Furthermore, the fluorocarbon compounds<br>
described in Patent Literature 5 are insoluble in water and hardly soluble<br>
in usual organic solvents, and halogen-containing solvents are necessary<br>
for the coating, which causes an environmental problem.<br>
The present inventors et al. have also proposed a recording<br>
medium containing an image-repellent agent that is comprised of a<br>
fluorocarbon compound, a silicone compound, an alkyl group-containing<br>
surfactant (e.g. see Patent Literature 6). However, employment of the<br>
fluorocarbon compound and/or the silicone compound causes problems<br>
similar with those described above. In some cases, toner-repellent<br>
agents containing an alkyl group may remove image forming materials;<br>
however, there exist such problems as the fixing ability of image-forming<br>
materials is unstable and/or the peeling of image-forming materials is<br>
insufficient, since the surfactants are of monomolecular with small<br>
molecular weights, thus the surfactants tend to migrate into peeling<br>
members, image-forming materials, and/or recording medium, therefore,<br>
the amount or rate of image forming materials-repellent agents is<br>
changeable.<br>
The present inventors et al. have also proposed a method for<br>
removing image-forming materials, in which a water-containing liquid is<br>
impregnated into paper with images formed by electrophotographic<br>
processes, the paper and a peeling member are contacted and pressed<br><br>
while being hated in a condition that the adhesive force between the<br>
paper and image forming materials is week, then the hot-flexible image<br>
forming materials are peeled away by use of paper (e.g. see Patent<br>
Literature 7). This method is advantageous in that transferring and<br>
peeling may be carried out under lowered adhesive force since a shear<br>
force generates between water-swelling paper fibers and non-swelling<br>
image forming materials.<br>
However, when this method is applied to conventional regular<br>
paper, the image forming materials are often incompletely removed due<br>
to occasionally higher adhesive force between image forming materials<br>
and paper, and/or a part of paper often is peeled away along with the<br>
image forming materials. It is also troublesome in that the addition of<br>
water tent to cause wrinkle or curl and then paper jam under repeated<br>
usage in image-forming apparatuses and/or image erasing apparatuses<br>
even when the additional water being a small amount. Addition of much<br>
water requires much energy to evaporate the water and leads to size<br>
change of regenerated recording media.<br>
The present inventors et al. have also proposed a recording<br>
medium in order to solve the problem in the methods for removing<br>
image-forming materials on recording media through impregnating a<br>
water-containing liquid as described in Patent Literature 7 etc., in which<br>
the adhesive force with toners is controlled by applying compounds with<br>
an alkyl group such as alkyl ketene dimer onto a surface of recording<br>
media thereby to control the contact angle with liquids having a surface<br><br>
tension equivalent with that of toners (e.g. see Patent Literature 8). In<br>
the Patent Literature 8, the adhesive force with image forming materials<br>
is reduced hy use of a synthetic sizing agent such as alkyl ketene dimer.<br>
This proposal is premised on that additional water can weaken the<br>
adhesive force between image forming materials and the recording media<br>
in the removal of the image forming materials. Therefore, it is difficult<br>
to apply the recording medium, disclosed in the Patent Literature 8, to<br>
image-erasing processes without adding a water-containing liquid as<br>
image-erasing promoting liquid since the adhesive force is excessively<br>
strong.<br>
Furthermore, the alkyl ketene dimer of sizing agent described in<br>
the Patent Literature 8 is monomolecular compounds having a melting<br>
point of 40°C to 70°C; therefore, the higher temperatures at the processes<br>
for erasing image-forming materials and/or in image-forming apparatuses<br>
melt the alkyl ketene dimer and promote the migration thereof into<br>
peeling members, image-forming materials, and/or recording media,<br>
consequently, the amount or rate on the surface of recording media is<br>
unstable. Accordingly, repeated usage thereof often leads to unstable<br>
fixing ability or difficult peeling of image forming materials, decrease of<br>
friction coefficient in the recording media, or difficult transportation of<br>
the recording media. Furthermore, the alkyl ketene dimer applied on<br>
the recording media often moves to paper-feeding rollers of image forming<br>
apparatuses or image erasing apparatuses, which making difficult to<br>
transport the recording media. In addition, Patent Literature 8<br><br>
describes that styrene, olefin or acrylic polymers may be used as a surface<br>
sizing agent other than the alkyl ketene dimer," however, there is no<br>
descriptions in terms of specific molecular structure of these polymers or<br>
excellent effect over the alkyl ketene dimer.<br>

electrophotographic methods that form images on recording media by use<br>
of conventional image forming materials that contain thermoplastic<br>
resins; the images may be fixed in a commercially feasible way; the<br>

(ni) repeated usage of the recording media causes substantially<br>
no change in image-quality, fixing ability or erasing ability;<br>
Gv) cost and/or environmental load may be lessened in the<br>
production of the recording media;<br>
(v) resources in the processes or apparatuses for forming or<br>
erasing images may be lessened, and also no waste product to be<br>
landfilled yields from image forming or erasing processes, environmental<br>
load and cost may be reduced.<br>
The objects and advantages may be attained by the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for<br>
reusing a recording medium that comprises forming an image on a<br><br>
recording medium by use of an image forming material, and removing the<br>
image forming material from the recording medium through thermal<br>
transfer by use of a peeling member,<br>
wherein the recording medium is a paper produced through a step<br>
of applying a treatment liquid at size pressing after paper making and<br>
then drying the treatment liquid, the treatment liquid comprises a<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain as an image-repellent<br>
substance, the image forming material comprises a thermoplastic resin,<br>
and the adhesive strength between the peeling member and the image<br>
forming material is higher than the adhesive strength between the<br>
recording medium and the image forming material.<br>
In accordance with the invention described above, the image<br>
forming materials may be completely removed without using an image<br>
removal-promoting liquid, high-quality images may be formed and the<br>
fixing ability may be maintained in a sufficient level, and the resultant<br>
images may be completely erased repeatedly through a thermal transfer<br>
process, since the recording media have a feasible fixing ability and the<br>
polymer is employed for an image-repellent substance in the recording<br>
media.<br>
Preferably, the water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer is<br>
produced by saponifying a polymer formed from an olefin, which having a<br>
double bond at alpha-site and a carbon number of 10 or more, and maleic<br>
anhydride.<br><br>
In the method for reusing a recording medium, the recording<br>
media containing the saponified polymer as the image repellent<br>
substance may exhibit an appropriate adhesive strength with image<br>
forming materials containing a thermoplastic resin and make possible to<br>
completely remove the image forming materials fixed on the recording<br>
media through a thermal transfer process. In addition, handwriting<br>
property and/or transporting property of recording media may be<br>
improved since friction coefficient of the recording media may be fallen in<br>
a proper range.<br>
Furthermore, the polymer of the image-repellent substance is<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible, therefore, conventional size press<br>
systems for paper production may be used without modification, and the<br>
method according to the present invention may be carried out without<br>
addressing a countermeasure for combustibility.<br>
Preferably, the treatment liquid comprises, in addition to the<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer, at least a compound selected<br>
from the group consisting of starches, starch derivatives, polyvinyl<br>
alcohols, styrene-butadiene copolymer emulsions, vinyl acetate emulsions,<br>
and water-soluble or water-dispersible acrylic resins, in an amount that<br>
the weight ratio of the polymer to the compound is from 1 : 50 to 1 : 1 as<br>
solid content.<br>
The compounds selected from the group described above are<br>
typically inexpensive compared to the polymers with an alkyl group<br>
having a carbon number of 8 or more, which making possible to reduce<br><br>
the cost of the recording media. In addition, the compounds described<br>
above in an amount within a certain range may effect to improve<br>
handwriting property and/or to raise stiffness of recording media without<br>
deteriorating the effect of image-repellent substance, adjust the balance<br>
of fixing ability and peeling property, and reduce environmental load<br>
without increasing CO2 emission since starches and starch derivatives<br>
are produced from plants.<br>
Preferably, the treatment liquid is applied to one side of the paper<br>
in an amount of 0.5 to 4 g/m2 as solid content.<br>
The amount of the treatment liquid may improve the balance of<br>
fixing property and erasing property of the image forming materials; that<br>
is, the fixing ability may be enhanced due to relatively large irregularity<br>
caused from cellulose fibers as well as appropriate adhesive with image<br>
forming materials, and also the effect of image-repellent substance is<br>
well-balanced, which making possible to remove the image forming<br>
materials on the recording media onto the peeling member through<br>
thermal transfer.<br>
Preferably, an expression is displayed on the recording medium to<br>
be reusable through removing the image forming material.<br>
The expression on the recording medium may provide users with<br>
sure information when reusable materials are desired. That is, reusable<br>
recording media and/or non-reusable recording media may be certainly<br>
distinguished in user selection, or image forming or image erasing<br>
apparatuses. In addition, the expression may prevent inclusion of<br><br>
non-reusable recording media into image erasing apparatuses, for<br>
example, paper-jam due to the inclusion may be avoided.<br>
The recording medium according to the present invention may be<br>
difficult to be distinguished from non-reusable recording media by visual<br>
inspection, thus the expression to be reusable may be valuable in many<br>
cases.<br>
Preferably, the image forming material is removed through<br>
thermal transfer by use of the peeling member without applying an image<br>
removal-promoting liquid.<br>
When the inventive recording medium is utilized in the inventive<br>
method for reusing a recording medium in particular, image forming<br>
materials on the recording medium may be completely removed. The<br>
exclusion of image removal-promoting liquid may effectively prevent<br>
uneven swelling of cellulose fibers in recording media, which may reduce<br>
the occurrences of curl, wrinkle or jam at image forming or image erasing<br>
apparatuses and raise the reusable times of recording media; and also the<br>
energy to evaporate its medium such as water comes to unnecessary.<br>
Preferably, the image forming material comprises a wax in an<br>
amount of 1% by mass or more. In the inventive method for reusing a<br>
recording medium, the wax in an amount of 1% by mass in the image<br>
forming material may effectively prevent the transfer of the image<br>
forming material onto various parts or members in the image forming<br>
processes such as fixing rollers, fixing belts, intermediate transfer rollers,<br>
etc. even with no use of release agents such as silicone oils.<br><br>
Preferably, the surface layer of the peeling member, which<br>
contacting with the recording medium at the thermal transfer, comprises<br>
a thermoplastic resin that exhibits plasticity at the thermal transfer<br>
temperature of the image forming material.<br>
The thermo plastic resin in the surface layer of the peeling<br>
member may bring about effective removal of image forming materials on<br>
recording media even with higher irregularity.<br>
Preferably, the image forming material is removed through the<br>
thermal transfer at an upstream side and at a downstream side by use of<br>
two different peeling members, the surface layer of the peeling member at<br>
upstream side, which contacting with the recording medium at the<br>
thermal transfer, comprises a thermoplastic resin that exhibits<br>
substantially no plasticity at the thermal transfer temperature of the<br>
image forming material, and the surface layer of the peeling member at<br>
the downstream side, which contacting with the recording medium at the<br>
thermal transfer, comprises a thermoplastic resin that exhibits plasticity<br>
at the thermal transfer temperature of the image forming material.<br>
The removal of the image forming materials at an upstream side<br>
and at a downstream side by use of two different peeling members as<br>
described above may bring about more complete removal of the image<br>
forming materials and higher durability of the peeling members.<br>
Preferably, the image is formed by use of a powdery<br>
image-forming material that contains a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
colorant by way of an electrophotographic process.<br><br>
The use of the powdery image-forming material may be effective<br>
to assure appropriate fixing ability in cases where the recording medium<br>
has a relatively high surface irregularity, for example, in the recording<br>
medium according to the present invention described below.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a reusable<br>
recording medium, utilized in the method for reusing a recording medium<br>
described above, wherein the recording medium is a paper produced<br>
through a step of applying a treatment liquid at size pressing after paper<br>
making and then drying the treatment liquid, and the treatment liquid<br>
comprises a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having an alkyl<br>
group with a carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain as an<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Method for reusing a recording medium that comprises forming<br>
an image on a recording medium by use of an image forming material,<br>
and removing the image forming material from the recording medium<br>
through thermal transfer by use of a peeling member, wherein the<br>
recording medium is a paper produced through a step of applying a<br>
treatment liquid at size pressing after paper making and then drying the<br>
treatment liquid, the treatment liquid comprises a water-soluble or<br><br>
water-dispersible polymer having an alkyl group with a carbon number of<br>
8 or more at its side chain as an image-repellent substance, the image<br>
forming material comprises a thermoplastic resin, and the adhesive<br>
strength between the peeling member and the image forming material is<br>
higher than the adhesive strength between the recording medium and the<br>
image forming material.<br>
The inventive recording medium may be produced by making<br>
paper based on cellulose fibers, then applying an image-repellent<br>
substance in a size pressing step thereby to reduce the adhesive force<br>
with image removal-promoting liquids.<br>
The cellulose fibers used in the paper making may be of wood such<br>
as chemical pulp and mechanical pulp, non-wood such as bagasse and<br>
kenaf, regenerated pulp from old paper, or regenerated pulp from waste<br>
sheets. The cellulose fibers may contain pigments such as calcium<br>
carbonate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide and barium sulfate and/or sizing<br>
agents such as rosins, alkenyl succinates and alkyl ketene dimers, and<br>
other chemicals.<br>
The image-repellent substance reduces the adhesive force<br>
between the recording medium and the image forming material thereon,<br>
thereby making possible to remove the image forming material, through<br>
thermal transfer by use of a peeling member.<br>
In the present invention, image-repellent substance of a polymer,<br>
having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain,<br>
may be inhibited for its migration within an/or outside the recording<br><br>
medium by virtue of the relatively long side chain, which allows stable<br>
fixing ability and peeling property of image forming materials under<br>
repeated usage of the recording medium.<br>
As described above for the prior art, the image-repellent<br>
substance of conventional surfactants or waxes may lead to recording<br>
media on which the image forming materials being able to be transferred<br>
or erased; however, there are problems that the fixing ability and/or the<br>
peeling property are unstable under the storage of recording media with<br>
time in particular under higher temperatures and higher humidities<br>
since the surfactants or waxes are of monomolecular with small molecular<br>
weights. Furthermore, the image-repellent substance tends to migrate<br>
into peeling members, image forming materials or recording media by<br>
action of thermal stress and/or pressing at peeling and/or removing steps<br>
during their repeated usage, which are likely to arise problems in terms<br>
of unstable fixing ability and peeling property of image forming materials.<br>
On the contrary, the image-repellent substance is a polymer in the<br>
present invention, thus the relatively long molecular length tends to<br>
inhibit the molecular migration compared to monomers such as<br>
surfactants and monomers, which leads to the effects intended for the<br>
image-repellent substance and resolves the problems of unstable<br>
properties under the storage or repeated usage.<br>
The polymerization degree of the polymer as the image-repellent<br>
substance is preferably 3 to 5000. The polymer with excessively lower<br>
polymerization degrees tends to migrate into peeling members, image<br><br>
forming materials or recording media similar as the cases where<br>
monomolecular surfactants or waxes are employed, which resulting in<br>
unstable fixing ability and peeling property of image forming materials.<br>
On the other hand, the polymer with excessively higher polymerization<br>
degrees tends to decrease aqueous solubility or excessively higher<br>
solution viscosity, which resulting in difficult coating of the polymer<br>
solution. As such, the polymerization of the polymer as the<br>
image-repellent substance is preferably 20 to 1000 in particular.<br>
The image-repellent substance, having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain, may allow the thermal<br>
transfer of image forming materials onto peeling members even with no<br>
use of water or organic solvents and sufficiently decrease the adhesive<br>
strength of image forming materials enough to remove from the recording<br>
medium. The image-repellent substance, having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of less than 8 at its side chain, tends to decrease the<br>
adhesive strength insufficiently.<br>
There is no set limit for the carbon number; however, compounds<br>
with a carbon number of 26 or more are commercially difficult to obtain.<br>
The carbon number of alkyl groups is preferably 8 to 24, more preferably<br>
10 to 22 from the viewpoint of proper image-repellency of recording media<br>
and appropriate balance of the fixing ability and the peeling property.<br>
The alkyl group of the image-repellent substance may be linear or<br>
branched in order to reduce the adhesive strength of the image forming<br>
materials. Usually, the larger is the carbon number of the alkyl group,<br><br>
the more significant is the effect of the image-repellent substance.<br>
Specifically, the optimum carbon number depends on the polymer since<br>
the content of alkyl groups in the polymer or molecular structure at other<br>
than alkyl groups affect the effect of the image-repellent substance.<br>
Specific examples of the polymers having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of 8 or more include saponified olefin-maleic anhydride<br>
copolymers, polyacrylic esters, polymethacrylic esters, acrylic<br>
ester-acrylic acid copolymers, methacrylic ester-methacrylic acid<br>
copolymers, olefin-acrylic ester-acrylic acid copolymers,<br>
olefin-methacrylic ester-methacrylic acid copolymers, graft polymers of<br>
olefins with polyacrylic acids, graft polymers of olefins with<br>
polymethacrylic acids, etc. For example, the acrylic polymers having an<br>
alkyl group with a carbon number of 8 or more may be synthesized by<br>
polymerization of an ester monomer that is a reaction product of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid and an alcohol having an alkyl group with a carbon<br>
number of 8 or more.<br>
Among these polymers, preferable are water-soluble or<br>
water-dispersible saponified products of polymers between olefins and<br>
maleic anhydride from the viewpoint of appropriate image repellency of<br>
recording media and proper balance between the fixing ability and the<br>
peeling property. The olefins as used herein mean hydrocarbon<br>
compounds that preferably have a double bond at the alpha-site or the<br>
chain end and a carbon number of 10 or more, and are polymerizable<br>
through addition polymerization; more specifically, those expressed by<br><br>
the general formula (1) below are exemplified, in which R1 represents a<br>
linear alkyl group.<br><br>
Specific example of the compounds expressed by the formula (1) is<br>
the compound expressed by the formula (2).<br><br>
The olefins may also be those that have an alkyl group with a<br>
double bond at the alpha-site or chain end and a carbon number of 10 or<br>
more and have a blanched alkyl group as shown by the formula (3), in<br>
which R3 and R4 represent each a linear alkyl group.<br><br>
Olefins having a double bond at other than the alpha-site are<br>
exemplified by the formula (4) below, in which R5 and R6 in the formula<br>
(4) represent each a linear alkyl group with a carbon number of 1 or more.<br><br><br>
The olefin monomer for the polymer utilized in the present<br>
invention may be any compounds exemplified above; preferably, olefins<br>
having a double bond at the alpha-site are employed. That is, when an<br>
olefin polymerizes that has a double bond at the alpha-site, a polymer<br>
may be synthesized that has two carbon atoms at the ends of the<br>
alpha-olefin monomer within the principal chain and the other carbon<br>
atoms within the side chain. For example, when an alpha-olefin with a<br>
carbon number of 13 is polymerized, a polymer with a carbon number of<br>
11 is synthesized.<br>
Preferably, the carbon number of the olefin monomer is 10 or more,<br>
particularly preferably 12 to 20. When the carbon number is below 10,<br>
the image-repellency tends to be insufficient, specifically, the images on<br>
recording media are hardly transferred to peeling members without<br>
applying organic solvents or surfactant-containing liquids. The<br>
olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer may be synthesized by reaction of the<br>
olefin and maleic anhydride under heating and pressuring.<br>
Olefin compounds of commercial mass product are typically a<br>
mixture of olefins with different carbon numbers. The inclusion of<br>
olefins having a carbon number of 9 or less scarcely affects the fixing<br>
ability or erasing property in general. In cases where olefin-maleic<br><br>
anhydride copolymers are employed, the fixing ability or erasing property<br>
of recording media typically depends on the compounds having a higher<br>
carbon number in the olefin mixture. The olefin is not necessarily<br>
required a double bond at the alpha-site; however, the double bonds at<br>
other than the alpha-site may be difficult to form a polymer since<br>
polymerization reaction hardly progresses.<br>
Another monomer of the olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer is<br>
maleic anhydride expressed by the formula (5).<br><br>
When maleic anhydride and an olefin undergo a polymerization<br>
reaction, for example, the both are dissolved in an organic solvent or the<br>
both are mixed with no organic solvent then heated in an autoclave to<br>
cause the polymerization reaction. The mole ratio of the olefin monomer<br>
to maleic anhydride is preferably from 1.3/1 to 1/1.3 in the polymerization<br>
reaction, which may bring about a polymer that provides proper fixing<br>
ability and stable image-erasing property. The reason is believed,<br>
without intending to be bound by any theory, that the range of mole ratio<br>
may bring about a polymer of alternative olefin and maleic anhydride<br>
with higher regularity.<br><br>
In other words, it is believed that the paper of recording media,<br>
which being produced by applying a polymer having regularly an olefin<br>
portion for representing the image'repellency and an maleic acid portion<br>
for allowing water-solubility at size pressing after paper making, has s<br>
surface to which the maleic acid portion affords a degree of affinity with<br>
image forming; materials even after drying the recording media, thus the<br>
fixing ability due to the maleic acid portion and the image-erasing ability<br>
due to the olefin portion can be well-balanced, and resulting in stably<br>
reusable recording media.<br>
In the present invention, an olefrrrmaleic anhydride copolymer,<br>
from a polymerization reaction between an olefin monomer and maleic<br>
anhydride monomer, is hydrolyzed and saponified to prepare a<br>
water-soluble polymer, which is utilized as a treating liquid for an<br>
image-repellent substance at size pressing step.<br>
The olefin maleic anhydride copolymer, hydrolyzed and saponified<br>
in an alkaline solution, is considered to have the structure expressed by<br>
the formula (6) below, in which M1 and M2 represent each a base.<br><br><br>
Examples of the base include sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds and<br>
phosphonium compounds. Preferably, the olefin-maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer is saponified in an ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution and<br>
utilized as a water-soluble polymer. When the ammonium salt of the<br>
olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer is utilized as the image-repellent<br>
substance, and the treatment liquid containing the salt is heated and<br>
dried at size pressing after paper making, ammonia is detached from the<br>
salt to make the saponified olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer into<br>
non-soluble or hardly soluble within water, consequently, the material<br>
containing the image-repellent substance can be made water resistant.<br>
The sequential processing, in which the olefin-maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer is made into water-soluble by being hydrolyzed and saponified<br>
using a base and is applied on a recording medium using an aqueous<br>
solvent, can be carried out safely and inexpensively, since aqueous<br>
solvents rather than organic solvents are utilized in the processing. In<br>
addition, the saponified olefin-maleic anhydride copolymer can be<br>
blended with other conventional inexpensive surface sizing agents such<br>
as starches, starch derivatives and polyvinyl alcohols without impairing<br>
the effects of the image-repellent substance, therefore, the combination<br>
with other surface sizing agents may bring about inexpensive reusable<br>
recording media with higher safety and lower environmental load.<br>
Previously, silicone compounds or fluorocarbon compounds have<br>
been proposed for the image-repellent substance of reusable recording<br><br>
media; however, silicone compounds or fluorocarbon compounds hardly<br>
dissolve or disperse into water, thus it is difficult to add these compounds<br>
at size pressing after paper making. Furthermore, silicone compounds<br>
typically decrease image-fixing ability excessively even though the image<br>
erasing property is satisfactory, thus there may arise such problems that<br>
image quality degrades due to offset at image formation, image-forming<br>
materials drop out from the recording media in use, which making images<br>
illegible and/or polluting the surround. The present invention can also<br>
solve these problems.<br>
Method for Producing Reusable Recording Medium<br>
The inventive recording media are produced through a step of<br>
applying a treatment liquid at size pressing after paper making and then<br>
drying the treatment liquid, and the treatment liquid comprises a<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain as an image-repellent<br>
substance. The treatment liquid containing the image-repellent<br>
substance is applied before completely drying the resultant paper, then<br>
the treatment liquid is applied and dried, which avoids the duplicated<br>
drying of after the paper making and after the treatment-liquid<br>
application.<br>
In the size pressing step, it is difficult to use a solvent; other than<br>
water and hydrophilic organic solvents, and water is the desirable solvent<br>
in view of production safety. Therefore, the image-repellent substance is<br><br>
required to be water-soluble or water-dispersible. As described above,<br>
the olefurmaleic anhydride copolymer is preferably saponified in an<br>
ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution thereby to utilize as a<br>
water-soluble polymer; in addition, polymers containing (meth)acrylic<br>
acid derivatives are utilized as a water-soluble or ionic compound.<br>
The size pressing step after the paper making step is a<br>
conventional step in paper making methods, thus a sizing agent is added<br>
in the step in order to retard the water infiltration into the resultant<br>
paper.<br>
Two-roll sizing presses, gate roll sizing presses with metalling<br>
rolls, and rod metalling sizing presses with metalling rolls are usually<br>
utilized in the size pressing step. The inventive recording media may be<br>
produced by use of any sizing presses, specifically, conventional sizing<br>
presses may be utilized without modification.<br>
In the size pressing step to produce the inventive recording media,<br>
various compounds may be included to the treatment liquid containing<br>
the polymer of the image-repellent substance; preferably, at least one<br>
compound selected from the group consisting of starches, starch<br>
derivatives, polyvinyl alcohols, styrene-butadiene copolymer emulsions,<br>
vinyl acetate emulsions, and water-soluble or water-dispersible acrylic<br>
resins is included in an amount of from 1/50 to 1/1 for the polymer to the<br>
compound as solid content.<br>
These compounds are relatively inexpensive, thus the cost of the<br>
recording media may be reduced, and also the balance of the fixing ability<br><br>
and the peeling property between the recording media and the<br>
image-repellent substance may be adjusted by blending the compound<br>
and the polymer without deteriorating the effect of the image-repellent<br>
substance. Among the compounds described above, starches and their<br>
derivatives such as starch oxides and starch phosphates are derived from<br>
plants, which leading to less exhaust amount of CO2 gas and less<br>
environmental load.<br>
It is preferred that the liquid at the size pressing step contains the<br>
image-repellent substance and the other compounds in an amount of from<br>
1/50 to 1/1 as solid content as described above. In cases where the<br>
content of the image-repellent substance is excessively low, the effect of<br>
the image-repellent substance is insufficient, resulting in insufficient<br>
removal of image forming materials from the recording media. The<br>
balance of the fixing ability and the peeling property may be<br>
well-controlled by use only the polymer of the image-repellent substance<br>
without the compounds described above. However, the inclusion of the<br>
compounds other than the polymer may increase the stiffness of paper,<br>
improve the writing property using ball pens, pencils, fountain pens, oily<br>
ink marker and aqueous ink marker, and decrease the cost of recording<br>
media due to their inexpensive price.<br>
The treatment liquid at the size pressing step may contain a<br>
pigment in order to improve the recording media in terms of whiteness,<br>
transparency and friction coefficient, color for distinguishable<br>
information, or enhance writing property.<br><br>
Examples of the white pigment include inorganic pigments such<br>
as kaolin, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, calcium carbonate, alumina, diatom<br>
earth, barium sulfate and silica, and organic pigments such as<br>
crosslinked styrene polymer, styrene-butadiene copolymers,<br>
styrene-acrylic copolymers and urea resins.<br>
A small amount of color pigments such as phthalocyanine may<br>
provide distinguishable information to be a reusable recording medium or<br>
not. An additional dye at the size pressing step may color the reusable<br>
recording medium for the information.<br>
The optimal amount of the treatment liquid, containing the<br>
image-repellent substance, applied at the size pressing step depends on<br>
the thickness or length of cellulose fibers or image forming materials; in a<br>
case of kraft pulp that is typically utilized for high-quality paper, the<br>
amount is preferably 0.5 to 4 g/m2 as solid content at one side.<br>
It is preferred that substantially the same amount of the same<br>
composition is applied to both sides of the inventive recording medium in<br>
order to make use of the both sides and prevent the curl; in such case, the<br>
amount of the composition is preferably 1 to 8 g/m2 as dried amount.<br>
In order to enhance the smoothness of the recording media, the<br>
recording media are preferably subjected to super-calendar treatment.<br>
This treatment may enhance the image-erasing ability and to reduce the<br>
amount of the composition containing the image-repellent substance.<br>
It is preferred that the inventive reusable recording media have<br>
an expression able to reuse after erasing the image forming materials,<br><br>
which making possible for users to distinguish, reusable recording media<br>
from usual non-reusable media.<br>
The recording medium according to the present invention may be<br>
difficult to be distinguished from non-reusable recording media by visual<br>
inspection since the deposited amount of the composition is relatively<br>
small, thus the expression to be reusable may be valuable in many cases.<br>
Examples of the expression to be reusable are a notch as shown in<br>
FIG. 1A, a perforation as shown in FIG. 1B, plural perforations as shown<br>
in FIG. 1C, and a bar code as shown in FIG. 1D; alternatively, marks<br>
other than bar codes, printing by use of light-absorptive inks<br>
non-detectable visually such as UV-rays and IR rays, fluorescent inks,<br>
dyes and pigments, in addition, 1C tips sensitive or generating an<br>
electromagnetic wave may be available.<br>
It is preferred that the expression to be reusable is hardly<br>
disappeared during image forming or erasing processes and easily<br>
distinguishable for users. From the viewpoint, the notch or perforation<br>
described above is most preferable.<br>
Method for Reusing Recording Medium<br>
The inventive method for reusing a recording medium carries out<br>
a series of forming and erasing an image repeatedly by use of a<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having an alkyl group with a<br>
carbon number of 8 or more at its side chain as an image-repellent<br>
substance, in which the image forming material comprises a<br>
thermoplastic resin, and the adhesive strength between the peeling<br><br>
member and the image forming material is higher than the adhesive<br>
strength between the recording medium and the image forming material.<br>
In order to remove image forming materials formed on a recording<br>
medium with a surface irregularity such as paper, it is difficult to remove<br>
the image through thermal transfer when the image forming material<br>
contains no thermoplastic resin, since image forming materials with no<br>
thermoplasticity offer insufficient contact between the image forming<br>
material and peeling member.<br>
In the inventive method for reusing a recording medium, the<br>
image forming material is removed from the recording medium in a way<br>
that heating the image forming material on the recording medium to<br>
soften the image forming material, contacting a peeling member with the<br>
image forming material on the recording medium, separating the<br>
recording medium and the peeling member, transferring the image<br>
forming material onto the peeling member, thereby removing the image<br>
forming material from the recording medium.<br>
Accordingly, the image forming material is required for the<br>
following properties: the image forming material has thermoplasticity<br>
and adheres to the peeling member; the image forming material has a<br>
cohesive force higher than the adhesive force with the recording media at<br>
separating the recording medium and the peeling member; the image<br>
forming material exhibits a moderate elasticity at heat-softened condition<br>
so as not infiltrate deeply into the recording medium; the image forming<br>
material has a degree of thickness on the recording medium so as to<br><br>
contact with the peeling member.<br>
The process to form images may be properly selected as long as<br>
the image forming material has the necessary properties described above.<br>
The image forming process may be exemplified by conventional<br>
electrophotographic processes, in which a photoconductor is<br>
electrostatically charged, a latent image formed by exposure is developed<br>
by use of a powder toner, the developed tone image is transferred directly<br>
onto a recording medium or through an intermediate transfer body, and<br>
fixing the image forming material by heating.<br>
In the popular electrophotographic apparatuses having a<br>
photoconductor, thermoplastic powder containing a thermoplastic resin is<br>
utilized as the image forming material; the image forming material is<br>
transferred onto a recording medium, then the image forming material is<br>
transferred onto a recording medium by use of a thermal fixing apparatus<br>
consisting of a heating roller, heat fixing belt, light irradiation unit, etc.<br>
In addition to the conventional electrophotographic processes<br>
using a photoconductor, the other processes may be applied to the present<br>
invention, such as electrostatic recording processes in which electrostatic<br>
images are formed by controlling an ion stream using a needle electrode<br>
etc. and developed using a powder toner, or so-called toner-jet processes<br>
in which the stream of powdery toner particles is controlled by an<br>
electrode and images are formed on recording media. These processes<br>
usually utilize thermoplastic toners, which being thermally fixed<br>
similarly on recording media, thus can be suitably applied to the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, hot-melt ink-jet recording processes in which a<br>
melted ink containing a thermoplastic resin is ejected to an intermediate<br>
transfer body and the resulting image is transferred onto a recording<br>
medium, thermal transfer recording processes in which an ink on a<br>
thermosensitive transfer ribbon is transferred onto a recording medium<br>
by use of a heating element, and printing processes such as gravure<br>
printing, offset printing, screen printing, pad printing and stencil<br>
printing may be applied to the present invention as long as the inks are<br>
prepared to be thermoplastic with appropriate viscoelastLcity.<br>
The particle diameter of the powdery image forming materials<br>
may be properly selected depending on application; in particular, the<br>
volume average particle size of 3 to 15 m tends to bring about excellent<br>
images with relatively large thickness on recording media, thus leading to<br>
appropriate image erasion.<br>
The powdery image forming materials utilized in the present<br>
invention may be ones produced by conventional milling processes, or<br>
ones produced by chemical processes such as of dispersion polymerization<br>
and suspension polymerization that can be well-controlled with respect to<br>
particle diameter, particle diameter distribution, shape, etc. compared to<br>
the milling processes, or others being appropriate for the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the present invention, the image forming materials comprise a<br>
thermoplastic resin in order to exhibit appropriate fixing ability and the<br><br>
peeling property as described above. Examples of the thermoplastic<br>
resin include polyester resins, polystyrenes, poly-p-chlorostyrene,<br>
styrene-p-chlorostyrene copolymers, styrene-propylene copolymers,<br>
styrene-vinyltoluene copolymers, styrene-vinylnaphthalene copolymers,<br>
styrene-methylacrylate copolymers, styrene-ethylacrylate copolymers,<br>
styrene-butylacrylate copolymers, styrene-octylacrylate copolymers,<br>
styrene-methylmethacrylate copolymers, styrene-ethylmethacrylate<br>
copolymers, styrene -butylmethacrylate copolymers,<br>
styrene-alpha-chloromethylmethacrylate copolymers,<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene-vinylmethylketone copolymers,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-isoprene copolymers,<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile-indene copolymers, styrene-maleic acid copolymers,<br>
styrene-maleate copolymers, polymethylmethacrylate,<br>
polybutylmethacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, epoxy resins-, epoxypolyol resins, polyurethane, polyamide,<br>
polyvinylbutyral, polyacrylic acid resins, rosins, modified rosins, terpene<br>
resins, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon resins, aromatic petroleum<br>
resins. Among these thermoplastic resins, polyester resins and<br>
styrene-acrylic resins are preferable in particular.<br>
The content of these resins is preferably 50 to 99.5% by mass in<br>
the image forming materials, particularly preferably 80 to 97% by mass.<br>
The glass transition temperature Tg, melting temperature and<br>
viscoelasticity of the thermoplastic resin in image forming materials are<br>
important in order to exhibit appropriate fixing/erasing properties of<br><br>
image forming materials. The glass transition temperature of 40°C to<br>
100°C may make possible to fix and erase the image forming materials at<br>
relatively low temperatures and to provide appropriate storage stability;<br>
more preferably, the glass transition temperature is 50°C to 70°C.<br>
Preferably, the thermoplastic resin exhibits 10000 dyne/cm2 of storage<br>
modulus at frequency 20 Hz and temperature 80°C or more, more<br>
preferably 90°C to 160°C.<br>
In the process to fix the image forming materials containing the<br>
thermoplastic resins, it is preferred that the image forming materials are<br>
pressed and fixed onto recording media by use of a fixing member heated<br>
at 100°C or more. The fixing strength of the image forming materials<br>
with inventive recording media, which being dependent with linear<br>
velocity, heating period and pressure, is typically insufficient when<br>
heated by use of a heating member of below 100°C; preferable heating<br>
temperature of the fixing member is 100°C to 240°C.<br>
The image forming materials may contain a colorant as an<br>
optional ingredient. Examples of the colorant include black pigments<br>
such as carbon blacks and iron oxide; yellow pigments such as C.I.<br>
pigment yellow 12, C.I. pigment yellow 13, C.I. pigment yellow 14, C.I.<br>
pigment yellow 15, C.I. pigment yellow 17, C.I. pigment yellow 93, CI.<br>
pigment yellow 94, C.I. pigment yellow 138, C.I. pigment yellow 155, C.I.<br>
pigment yellow 156, C.I. pigment yellow 180 and C.I. pigment yellow 185;<br>
magenta pigments such as CI. pigment red 2, C.I. pigment red 3, CI.<br>
pigment red 5, C.I. pigment red 16, C.I. pigment red 48:1, CI. pigment<br><br>
red 53:1, CI. pigment red 57:1, CI. pigment red 122, C.I. pigment red 123,<br>
CI. pigment red 139, CI. pigment red 144, C.I. pigment red 166, CI.<br>
pigment red 177, C.I. pigment red 178 and CI. pigment red 222; cyan<br>
pigments such as CI. pigment blue 15, CI. pigment blue 15:2, CI.<br>
pigment blue 15:3, CI. pigment blue 16 and CI. pigment blue 60. These<br>
colorants are preferably incorporated into image forming materials in an<br>
amount of 0.5 to 20% by mass, more preferably 1 to 10% by mass.<br>
It is preferred that the inventive image forming material<br>
comprises a wax in an amount of 1% by mass or more as a mold-release<br>
agent. Examples of the wax include carnauba wax, montan wax, honey<br>
wax, paraffin wax, and microcrystalline wax. The inclusion of these<br>
waxes in an amount of 1 to 10% by mass into image forming materials<br>
may effectively prevent in many cases so-called offset, i.e. deposition of<br>
partial image forming materials onto thermal fixing rollers or fixing belts,<br>
even without applying silicone oil to the thermal fixing rollers or fixing<br>
belts, which leading to simple construction of image forming apparatuses.<br>
The recording media in the present invention are based on<br>
cellulose fibers and the additional solid content is no more than the<br>
amount able to be added at size pressing; consequently, image forming<br>
materials can intertwine with cellulose fibers, the fixing ability emerges<br>
due to a mechanical anchor effect in a sufficient level for practical use and<br>
thus offsets can be prevented, which may afford a significant advantage<br>
that image forming materials are transferred and removed toward<br>
peeling members with no use of image removal-promoting liquid.<br><br>
On the other hand, since the additional solid content is no more<br>
than the amount able to be added at size pressing and there remains<br>
some irregularity affected by cellulose fibers, it may be difficult to remove<br>
sufficiently perfectly the remaining image forming materials by use of<br>
peeling members formed merely of thermal resistant plastics such as<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphtylate, polyimide,<br>
polysulfone, polyetheretherketone and polyphenylene sulfide; or metals<br>
such as stainless steel and nickel.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred in the image erasing process that the<br>
surface layer of peeling members to be contacted with recording media in<br>
the thermal transfer contains a thermoplastic resin that exhibits<br>
plasticity at the thermal transfer temperature. That is, when the<br>
peeling member with such a surface layer and the recording media are<br>
contacted and heated, the thermoplastic layer deforms plastically,<br>
allowing the contact of the peeling member with low-height images in<br>
depressed areas or low-density gray-scale images surrounded by<br>
high-height letter images, thereby making possible to remove<br>
substantially perfectly the image forming materials on recording media.<br>
However, the use of only the peeling member with such a<br>
thermoplastic surface layer may coxae to insufficient removal of image<br>
forming materials in some cases due to its durability in particular. In<br>
order to address this problem, it is preferred that two different peeling<br>
members are provided and the peeling step is carried out at upper stream<br>
as well as lower stream, and the peeling member for the lower stream has<br><br>
the peeling member with such a thermoplastic surface layer.<br>
The image forming apparatus utilized in the inventive method for<br>
reusing recording media will be explained with reference to drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an exemplary construction of an image forming<br>
apparatus for forming images by an electrophotographic process.<br>
In the image forming apparatus shown in FIG. 2, yellow (Y),<br>
magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K) images are formed on each<br>
photoconductor, the images formed in the different stations are<br>
transferred onto an intermediate image-transfer member 217, the<br>
transferred images on the intermediate image transfer member 217 is<br>
transferred onto a recording medium 237 which is conveyed from a<br>
recording medium storage casing 231, and the powdery images formed<br>
from image-forming materials are fixed to the recording medium 237<br>
through thermal fixture using an image-fixing roller 244. Such an<br>
electrophotographic color-image forming apparatus is conventional and<br>
classified into a conventional tandem color electrophotographic<br>
apparatus.<br>
The yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K)<br>
image-forming stations comprise the following conventional components<br>
for electrophotographic apparatuses as follows- specifically, the<br>
image-forming stations are consisted of for example, photoconductors 201<br>
(201Y, 201M, 201C and 201K), charging means 202 (202Y, 202M, 202C<br>
and 202K) for uniformly charging the photoconductors 201, light<br>
irradiation means (not shown), developers 203 (203Y, 203M, 203C, 203K),<br><br>
corona wire charges 205 (205Y, 205M, 205C, 205K), means 206 (206Y,<br>
206M, 206C, 206K) for applying an electric field, and cleaning means 207<br>
(207Y, 207M, 207C, 207K).<br>
The image forming apparatus may further comprise any optional<br>
components according to necessity in addition to these components.<br>
Examples of such additional components are charge-eliminating means,<br>
such as an AC charger and light irradiator, for eliminating the charge on<br>
the photoconductors 201 after image transfer; and controlling means for<br>
detecting the charge voltage applied to the photoconductors 201 in<br>
combination with control means for controlling the voltage applied to the<br>
chargers 202 so as to keep the surface potentials of the photoconductors<br>
201 at constant level even in varying environmental conditions or in<br>
deterioration due to repetitive use. When toner removal from the<br>
photoconductors 201 after image transfer is not required, the cleaning<br>
means 207 (207Y, 207M, 207C, 207K) can be omitted. Likewise, when<br>
there is no need of charging the powdery images formed on the<br>
photoconductors 201, the corona wire chargers 205 (205Y, 205M, 205C,<br>
205K) can be omitted.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 217, which being an endless belt, is<br>
arranged to contact rollers 211, 212, 214 and 215 with the inner wall<br>
thereof. A tension-mechanism (not shown) applies a suitable tension to<br>
the intermediate image-transfer belt 217. The intermediate<br>
image-transfer belt 217 has means 210 for eliminating powder deposited<br>
on the surface of the belt, such as a brush or roller. The image forming<br><br>
apparatus further comprises charge eliminating means and/or charging<br>
means for eliminating or uniforming the charge remained on the<br>
intermediate transfer belt after image transfer to the recording medium,<br>
depending on requirements.<br>
The recording medium, on which images being finally formed, is<br>
housed in recording medium storage casings 231 (231a, 231b, 231c, 231d)<br>
and is fed to a paper conveying system by action of paper-feed rollers 232<br>
(232a, 232b, 232c, 232d) and is conveyed via pairs of paper-feed rollers<br>
233 (233a, 233b, 233c, 233d, 233e, 233f, 233g, 233h, 233i). The powdery<br>
image is transferred from the intermediate image-transfer belt 217 to the<br>
recording medium by action of means 242 for applying an electric field,<br>
such as a voltage applying roller or a corona wire charger.<br>
The image-forming material transferred to the recording medium<br>
is fixed thereto by action of image-fixing means typically comprising<br>
heating roller or heating belt 244 and pressure roller 245. The recording<br>
medium bearing the fixed image is ejected via a pair of output rollers 241<br>
to output tray 240.<br>
The inventive reusable recording media is encased into, for<br>
example, paper-feed cassette 231a among 231a to 231d, and non-reusable<br>
recording media are encased into the other cassettes 231b, 231c and 231d.<br>
FIG. 3 is a partial enlarged cross-section of a rear edge, viewed in<br>
paper-feed direction, of paper-feed cassette 231a. A light-emitting<br>
element 238 and a light receiving element 239 are provided at near the<br>
rear edge and side edge of the paper-feed cassette 231a to detect notches<br><br>
or perforations.<br>
The signal at the light receiving element 239 is delivered to a<br>
control unit (not shown) to judge the existence of reusable recording<br>
media. Users can select the print mode of a first print mode where<br>
reusable recording media being printed or a second print mode where<br>
non-reusable recording media being printed.<br>
In the control panel or the user interface, the first image-forming<br>
mode may be indicated, for example, as a button or a selection choice<br>
marked as "Reuse", "Paper Reuse", "Reuse Mode", "Dedicated Paper",<br>
"Reusable Paper", "Resource Saving", "Short-Term Perusal" or<br>
"Short-term Use". The second image-forming mode may be indicated, for<br>
example, as a button or a selection choice marked as "Image-Fixing Mode",<br>
"High Image-Fixing", "Fix Mode", "Plain Paper", "Unused Paper",<br>
"Document Storage" or "External Distribution". The selection of the<br>
image-forming mode can also be set, for example, so that a higher priority<br>
is given to the first image-forming mode, the first image-forming mode is<br>
automatically selected unless the user takes an action, and the user takes<br>
an action to select the second image-forming mode only in the case where<br>
the user wants to form an image according to the second image-forming<br>
mode.<br>
An image erasing apparatus, utilized for image erasing in the<br>
inventive method for reusing recording media, that comprises a peeling<br>
member will be explained in the following.<br>
Specific Example (i)<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic view that shows an exemplary construction<br>
of an image erasing apparatus utilized in the inventive method for<br>
reusing recording media. The apparatus shown in FIG. 4 is constructed<br>
such that the removal of image forming materials through thermal<br>
transfer is carried out using two different peeling members at upstream<br>
and downstream.<br>
In the apparatus shown in FIG. 4, pressure roller 711, heating<br>
roller 712, heater 213, peeling member 717, separating block 714, tension<br>
roller 715, cleaning backup roller 716, cleaning blade 310 and image<br>
forming material-collecting container 719 construct a portion for<br>
removing image forming materials that has a peeling member of which<br>
the surface layer is non-plasticity at the temperature of the heating and<br>
pressing with recording media.<br>
The pressure roller 711 is, for example, an aluminum or stainless<br>
roller of 35 mm diameter and 3 mm thick that has an elastic layer of a<br>
silicon rubber of 3mm thick. A pressure unit (not shown) of springs,<br>
hydraulic or air pressure is provided between the pressure roller 711 and<br>
heating roller 712, thereby recording medium 700 and peeling member<br>
are contacted and pressed for removing image forming materials. The<br>
heating roller 712 is, for example, an aluminum or stainless roller of 35<br>
mm diameter and 3 mm thick, and the surface is treated with a<br>
fluorocarbon resin to avoid the deposition of image forming materials or<br>
dusts.<br>
The surface of pressure roller 711 is also treated with a<br><br>
fluorocarbon resin to avoid the deposition of image forming materials or<br>
dusts. Heater 213 such as halogen lamps and infrared lamps is disposed<br>
inside the heating roller 712. The temperature of the surface of heating<br>
roller 712 is detected by a surface thermometer (not shown), the detected<br>
temperature is input into a control unit (not shown) to control the electric<br>
power into the heater thereby to maintain the surface temperature of the<br>
heating roller at a predetermined level.<br>
The peeling member 717, which being an endless belt, is stretched<br>
over the heating roller 712, separating block 714, tension roller 715 and<br>
cleaning backup roller 716. The tension roller 715 is equipped with an<br>
urging member to apply a certain tension to the belt of the peeling<br>
member. The adhesive force of the peeling member 717 with the image<br>
forming materials is necessary to be higher than the adhesive force of the<br>
recording medium with the image forming materials.<br>
The peeling member 717 is a belt of about 75 to 300 m thick.<br>
The material of the peeling member 717 is preferably a film and may be a<br>
thermoplastic resin having no plasticity at 60°C to 150°C of usual image<br>
transfer temperature; examples of the material include polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polyethylene naphtylate, polyimide, polysulfone,<br>
polyetheretherketone and polyphenylene sulfide; or metals such as<br>
stainless steel and nickel.<br>
The pressure roller 711 is connected to and driven by an electric<br>
motor through a gear system (not shown). The peeling member 717 is<br>
moved at a linear velocity of 15 to 150 mm/sec, for example.<br><br>
The cleaning blade 310 may be, for example, a blade roller with<br>
plural-spiral grooves of diameter 25 mm made of a cutting steel, as shown<br>
in FIG. 5. Images transferred from recording medium 700 on peeling<br>
member 717 may be removed by way of rotating the cleaning blade 310<br>
reversely with the peeling member 717 or rotating the cleaning blade 310<br>
at a different velocity with the peeling member 717. In FIG. 5, 310a is<br>
an edge of a spiral groove, 310b is a spiral groove, and 9a is an angle<br>
between the center axis of the blade roller and the edge of the spiral<br>
groove. The 8a is arranged so that image forming materials of on the<br>
peeling member 717 can be adequately removed. The cleaning backup<br>
roller 716 bears a low-hardness elastomer like a sponge at the surface,<br>
and is equipped with a pressure unit (not shown) of springs, hydraulic or<br>
air pressure, thereby a pressure is applied with the cleaning blade 310 to<br>
form a nip. The image forming materials 730 scraped away by the<br>
peeling member 717 are accumulated in a collecting container 719 of<br>
image forming materials.<br>
In FIG. 4, pressure roller 721, heating roller 722, heater 723,<br>
peeling member 727, separating roller 724, cleaning portion-heating<br>
roller 226, heater 720, image forming material-pressure roller 225,<br>
cleaning blade 728 and image forming material-collecting container 729<br>
constitute an image forming material-removing/treating portion that has<br>
a peeling member of which the surface layer exhibits plasticity at the<br>
temperature to contact with the recording media.<br>
The pressure roller 721 has a heat-resistant elastic layer, like of a<br><br>
silicon rubber, similarly with the image forming<br>
material-removing/treating portion at upstream side. A pressure unit<br>
(not shown) of springs, hydraulic or air pressure is provided between the<br>
pressure roller 721 and the heating roller 722, thereby recording medium<br>
700 and peeling member 727 are contacted and pressed for removing<br>
image forming materials.<br>
Heater 723 such as halogen lamps and infrared lamps is disposed<br>
inside the heating roller 722. The temperature of the surface of heating<br>
roller 722 is detected by a surface thermometer (not shown), the detected<br>
temperature is input into a control unit (not shown) to control the electric<br>
power into the heater thereby to maintain the surface temperature of the<br>
heating roller at a predetermined level.<br>
The peeling member 727, which being an endless belt, is stretched<br>
over the pressure roller 721, separating roller 724, and cleaning<br>
portion-heating roller 226. An urging member (not shown) is equipped<br>
with the separating roller 724 to apply a certain tension to the belt of the<br>
peeling member. The separating roller is one having a diameter of about<br>
10 mm, of which the curvature making possible to separate the recording<br>
media and the peeling member.<br>
Since a greater part of image forming materials on the recording<br>
media is removed at upstream side, the adhesive strength between the<br>
recording media and the peeling member is relatively small at;<br>
downstream side compared to at upstream, thus the separating block at<br>
the downstream is unnecessary to have a curvature as small as that at<br><br>
upstream.<br>
The peeling member 727 is a belt of about 75 to 300 m thick, and<br>
a thermoplastic resin layer, having plasticity at 60°C to 160°C of usual<br>
image transfer temperature, is provided on the surface.<br>
The base material of the peeling member 727 is necessary to<br>
adhere to the plasticity layer more strongly than between the image<br>
forming materials and the recording media; the material may be similar<br>
with that of the polymer film of the peeling member 717 at upstream side<br>
such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphtylate, polyimide,<br>
polysulfone, polyetheretherketone and polyphenylene sulfide.<br>
It is also preferred that the base material is improved for the<br>
adhesive force with the plasticity layer by way of surface-roughening by<br>
sandblast treatment, corona discharge, UV rays irradiation, ion<br>
irradiation, electron beam irradiation and oxidation treatment.<br>
The plasticity layer on the base material is preferably of polyvinyl<br>
acetate resins, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, styrene-aerylie resins,<br>
polyester resins and nylon. Since at least near the surface of the<br>
plasticity layer on the base material is intermixed with image forming<br>
materials at the transfer step, it is preferred that the material of the<br>
plasticity layer is substantially the same with the resin in image forming<br>
materials on the recording media or to be used on the recording media.<br>
The employment of the same resin with image forming materials may<br>
bring about stable image-erasing property under prolonged usage of the<br>
image erasing device since the composition of the plasticity layer may be<br><br>
free from significant change thereof.<br>
The image forming material-pressure roller 225 is made of metals<br>
such as aluminum and stainless steel having a larger diameter at the roll<br>
center compared to at the end face. The surface is treated with<br>
compositions with lower surface energy such as fluorocarbon resin in<br>
order to inhibit adhesion of image forming materials thereon. A<br>
pressure unit (not shown) of springs, hydraulic or air pressure is provided<br>
between the image forming material-pressure roller 225 and the cleaning<br>
portion-heating roller 226. A pressure is applied between the image<br>
forming material-pressure roller 225 and the cleaning portion-heating<br>
roller 226 at least when cleaning the peeling member 727, thus the<br>
plasticity substance of the plasticity layer on the peeling member 727<br>
migrates to the smaller-diameter end faces of the image forming<br>
material-pressure roller 225.<br>
An elastomer layer such as of silicone rubber and sponge is<br>
disposed around the surface of the cleaning portion-heating roller 226,<br>
and a nip is formed between the pressure unit described above and the<br>
image forming material-pressure roller 225. Heater 720 such as halogen<br>
lamps and infrared lamps is disposed inside the cleaning portion-heating<br>
roller 226. The surface temperature of the cleaning portion-heating<br>
roller 226 is detected by a surface thermometer (not shown), the detected<br>
temperature is input into a control unit (not shown) to control the electric<br>
power into the heater 720 thereby to maintain the surface temperature of<br>
the cleaning portion-heating roller 226 at a predetermined level.<br><br>
The heater 720 performs to heat the plasticity layer on the peeling<br>
member thereby to enhance the flowability of the plasticity layer at<br>
cleaning the peeling member 727. The heating temperature of the<br>
plasticity layer at cleaning, being higher than at removing the image<br>
forming materials, may make easy to remove the image forming<br>
materials from peeling member 727 due to higher flowability of the<br>
plasticity layer. That is, in order to transfer the image forming<br>
materials properly into the peeling member at removing the image<br>
forming materials, it is necessary that the image forming materials have<br>
a degree of elasticity and the plasticity layer exhibits a higher cohesive<br>
strength. Separation between recording media and image forming<br>
materials with lower cohesive strength may remain the residual image<br>
forming materials on the recording media since the image forming<br>
materials are separated into the peeling member and the recording<br>
medium.<br>
On the contrary, the higher flowability of image forming materials<br>
may bring about effective removal of image forming materials on the<br>
peeling member, in the removing of image forming materials at<br>
downstream side. Accordingly, it is preferred that the temperature at<br>
the cleaning portion is about 20°C to 90°C higher than that at the peeling<br>
member of the image forming material removing portion.<br>
The cleaning blade 728 acts as a cutting blade with a thinner<br>
thickness, which having a blade 111 on one side of peeling member as<br>
shown in FIG. 6, in order to remove image forming materials protruded<br><br>
from the peeling member rather than scrubbing those on the peeling<br>
portion.<br>
The recording media 700, on which images being formed, are set<br>
into a paper-feeding cassette 701 with the side to be erased facing<br>
downward. The recording media 700 are picked up one by one using a<br>
pickup roller 702 and conveyed to image forming material-removing<br>
portion at upstream using a pair of paper-feeding rollers 703. The image<br>
forming materials on the recording media are heated and pressed by the<br>
nip between the pressure roller 711 and the heating roller 712, and the<br>
image forming materials made into plasticity adhere to the surface of the<br>
peeling member 717.<br>
The recording medium and the peeling member are separated by a<br>
separating block 714 having an edge of curvature radium of about 2 mm.<br>
At this stage, high-density gray-scale images are transferred to the<br>
peeling member among the solid images and letter images. Then the<br>
recording medium is conveyed to image forming material-removing<br>
portion of downstream site by a pair of paper-feeding rollers 704.<br>
In the image forming material-removing portion at upstream,<br>
every time of erasing of the image forming materials leads to removal of<br>
image forming materials on the peeling member by use of the cleaning<br>
blade 310. It is preferred that the temperature of the image forming<br>
materials is higher at the upstream than at downstream.<br>
Higher temperature when pressing at the upstream may enhance<br>
the flowability of image forming materials and collapse images with<br><br>
higher height, thus the adhesiveness of gray-scale images or lower images<br>
adjacent to higher images may be enhanced. Therefore, the amount of<br>
image forming materials to be removed at the upstream may be increased<br>
by raising the temperature.<br>
On the other hand, when image forming materials remain on the<br>
peeling member with different heights and also the transfer temperature<br>
is higher, the image forming materials tend to transfer reversibly to<br>
background etc. of recording media. In addition, lower planarity of the<br>
peeling member tends to decrease the removable images due to scarce<br>
contact of lower images with the peeling member. Therefore, it is<br>
preferred that the image forming materials on the peeling member at<br>
upstream are removed at every time of erasing of the image forming<br>
materials; and that at least the image forming materials transferred on<br>
the peeling member are made flat in order to prevent reverse transfer or<br>
reduction of life time.<br>
The recording media, a great part of image forming materials<br>
having been removed at upstream, are treated similarly at the image<br>
forming material-removing portion at downstream. At this down stream,<br>
the surface of the peeling member exhibits plasticity when the recording<br>
media and the peeling member are contacted, heated and pressed. The<br>
plasticity of the peeling member may make possible to contact the peeling<br>
member with image forming materials of various conditions and the<br>
image forming materials may be removed efficiently. The temperature<br>
of the peeling member at downstream is controlled lower than that of the<br><br>
upstream.<br>
When the temperature at downstream is higher than that at<br>
upstream, the plasticity layer of the peeling member adheres strongly<br>
with the recording media, which making difficult to separate the<br>
recording media and the peeling member or promoting the reverse<br>
transfer of the plasticity layer of the peeling member onto the recording<br>
media. As such, it is preferred that the temperature of the peeling<br>
member at the downstream is 5°C to 30°C lower than that of peeling<br>
member at upstream; specific temperature thereof is preferably 55°C to<br>
130°C.<br>
The removal or cleaning of image forming materials on the peeling<br>
member at downstream is not necessary to be carried out at every time of<br>
the removal processing of image forming materials by the peeling member.<br>
In the apparatus shown in FIG. 4, the removal or cleaning is controlled<br>
intermittently by a control portion (not shown). The amount of image<br>
forming materials removed at downstream is relatively small and the<br>
gaps between the transferred images are relatively little, therefore, the<br>
processing for removing the image forming materials may be carried out<br>
properly at not every time of the removal processing of the peeling<br>
member. Furthermore, in order to remove a part of the plasticity layer<br>
from the peeling member at downstream, the plasticity layer is preferably<br>
heated to a temperature higher than that at removal processing of the<br>
image forming materials; therefore, frequent heating of the peeling<br>
member is inadequate in view of energy saving.<br><br>
The cleaning of the peeling member at downstream is preferably<br>
carried out intermittently, more specifically, at stop period of removal<br>
processing of image forming materials rather than in parallel with the<br>
removal processing of image forming materials. This is because the<br>
plasticity layer is preferably heated to a temperature higher than that at<br>
removal processing of the image forming materials, therefore, the higher<br>
temperature at the cleaning portion should be dropped on the way to the<br>
image forming material-removing portion, which in turn requiring a<br>
cooling unit for the peeling member or longer distance of the peeling<br>
member.<br>
Specific Example (ii)<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic view that shows another exemplary<br>
construction of an image erasing apparatus utilized in the inventive<br>
method for reusing a recording medium. The same reference numbers<br>
with FIG. 4 denote common parts. In FIG. 7, heater 424 such as halogen<br>
lamps and infrared lamps is disposed inside the heating/separating block<br>
423 made of metals such as aluminum and stainless steel. The<br>
temperature of the surface of the heating/separating block 423 is detected<br>
by a surface thermometer (not shown), the detected temperature is input<br>
into a control unit (not shown) to control the electric power into the heater<br>
720 thereby to maintain the surface temperature of the<br>
heating/separating block 423 at a predetermined level.<br>
The pressure roller 711 is, for example, one made of aluminum or<br>
stainless steel with 50 mm diameter and 3 mm thick and has a<br><br>
heat-resistant elastic layer like a silicon rubber of 3 mm thick at the<br>
surface. A pressure unit (not shown) of springs, hydraulic or air<br>
pressure is provided between the heating/separating block, thereby<br>
recording medium 700 and peeling member 717 are contacted and<br>
pressed for removing image forming materials.<br>
In the apparatus shown in FIG. 7, pressure roller 711,<br>
heating/separating block 423, heater 424, peeling member 717, tension<br>
roller 715, cleaning backup roller 716, cleaning blade 310 and image<br>
forming material-collecting container 719 construct a portion for<br>
removing image forming materials, as the upstream portion of FIG. 4,<br>
that has a peeling member of which the surface layer is non-plasticity at<br>
the temperature of the heating and pressing with recording media.<br>
The peeling member 717, which being an endless belt, is stretched<br>
over the heating/separating block 423, tension roller 715 and cleaning<br>
backup roller 716. The tension roller 715 is equipped with an urging<br>
member to apply a certain tension to the belt of the peeling member.<br>
The heating/separating block 423 is one that has an edge portion<br>
of 3 mm curvature radius. The recording medium 700 with images to be<br>
removed and peeling member 717 are heated and pressed at the nip<br>
between the heating/separating block 423 and pressure roller 711 and<br>
then separated at the edge portion of heating/separating block 423. The<br>
upper surface of the heating/separating block 423, with which the peeling<br>
member slides, is treated with a fluorocarbon resin in order to reduce the<br>
friction coefficient and to avoid the deposition of image forming materials<br><br>
or dusts.<br>
The peeling member 717, cleaning backup roller 716, cleaning<br>
blade 310 and collection container 719 of image forming materials 719 are<br>
constructed and images are erased similarly with those of FIG. 4, and the<br>
cleaning operation is controlled to conduct at every removal of image<br>
forming materials.<br>
In the exemplary apparatus for removing image forming<br>
materials shown in FIG. 7, the peeling member 417 at downstream is<br>
formed into a web and wound onto cores 425, 426 so as to treat numerous<br>
sheets of recording media. Separating/pressing roller 428 is one with<br>
about 30 mm diameter and forms a nip with pressure roner 711 by action<br>
of a pressure unit (not shown) such as springs, hydraulic or air pressure.<br>
Heater 429 such as halogen lamps and infrared lamps is disposed inside<br>
the pressure roller 711, the surface temperature of the pressure roller is<br>
detected by a surface thermometer (not shown), and the detected<br>
temperature is input into a control unit (not shown) to control the electric<br>
power into the heater 429 thereby to maintain the surface temperature of<br>
the pressure roller at a predetermined level. The peeling member 417 at<br>
downstream and the recording medium, having been removed the image<br>
forming materials at upstream and separated from the peeling member,<br>
are contacted and pressed between the separating/pressure roller 428 and<br>
pressure roller 711. The recording medium, having been substantially<br>
completely removed the image forming materials through transferring<br>
onto the peeling member with a plasticity layer, is directed by action of<br><br>
guide plate 431 and stored into paper-discharge tray 709 by action of a<br>
pair of conveying rollers 705, 706.<br>
In the exemplary apparatus for removing image forming<br>
materials shown in FIG. 7, the cleaning by the peeling member at<br>
downstream is not conducted within the apparatus. A thermoplastic<br>
resin is disposed at the surface of the peeling member at downstream,<br>
similarly with FIG. 4, the base material of the peeling member may be<br>
preferably polymer compounds far from plasticity at the heating and<br>
pressing conditions; preferable examples thereof include polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polyethylene naphtylate, polyimide, polysulfone,<br>
polyetheretherketone and polyphenylene sulfide.<br>
In addition to the base materials described above, paper formed<br>
essentially of cellulose fibers is appropriately utilized in apparatuses as<br>
shown in FIG. 7. That is, conventional kinds of paper are porous and<br>
exhibit proper adhesive property, even without surface treatment, with<br>
plasticity layers such as polyvinyl acetate resins, ethylene vinylacetate<br>
copolymers, styrene-acrylic resins, polyester resins and nylon, therefore,<br>
the recording media and the peeling member can be separated with<br>
substantially no occurrence of interfacial separation between the base<br>
material and the plasticity layer. Furthermore, the paper is inexpensive,<br>
and easily turned into fuels or recycle paper.<br>
The web-like peeling member 417 at downstream shown in FIG. 7,<br>
wound on core 426, is taken up on core 425 in the process for removing<br>
image forming materials. An end mark is put in near the web end.<br><br>
When end mark-detecting unit 733 detects an end mark, a<br>
pressure-releasing unit (not shown) releases the pressure between the<br>
separating/pressure roller 428 and pressure roller 711, the peeling<br>
member at downstream is taken up to core 426, and the peeling member<br>
417 at downstream is used multiple times for removing image forming<br>
materials. The peeling member 417 at downstream may be typically<br>
used for 100 to 1000 sheets of recording media per one peeling member,<br>
provided that the area of the peeling member is the same as that of one<br>
sheet of the recording medium.<br>

anhydride). The autoclave was backfilled with nitrogen gas, and the<br>
mixture of these compounds was allowed to react at 200°C for 5 hours.<br>

carbon number of 18 to 20, was polymerized in a nitrogen atmosphere by<br>
a conventional method, then the resulting polymer was dried and<br>
dissolved into an aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution to prepare an<br><br>
aqueous solution containing an acrylic polymer, having a long chain alkyl<br>
group as a side chain, of 20% by mass as solid content (Treatment Liquid<br>

Comparative Synthesis Example 1<br>
An alpha-olefin mixture having branched alkyl chains (C8<br>
olefin/C9 olefin = 6/4 in mole ratio) and maleic anhydride were poured<br>
into an autoclave in a mole ratio of 1/1 (olefin/maleic anhydride). The<br>
autoclave was backfilled with nitrogen gas, and the mixture of these<br>
compounds was allowed to react at 200°C for 5 hours. The resulting<br>
reaction product was saponified with an aqueous ammonium hydroxide<br>

Color image formation and removal of the image forming<br>
materials were repeated using the recording media of Examples 1 to 8<br>
and Comparative Examples 1 to 9, then image properties for clearness,<br><br>
offset and fixing ability as well as image erasing property were evaluated.<br>
Evaluation Conditions<br>
Image Formation.<br>
Color images were formed using the image forming apparatus, of<br>
the construction being shown in FIG. 2 as described above, equipped with<br>
a unit to detect notches. No silicone oil was applied to the thermal fixing<br>
roller unless described definitely. The recording media, each having a<br>
notch, of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 9 were encased<br>
into the paper feed cassette of the image forming apparatus, a toner<br>
containing a principal component of a polyester and a wax of 1% mass or<br>
more (by Ricoh Co, Imagio Neo C285 colorant) was filled into the<br>
developing unit, and color images were formed under the following<br>
conditions. The results are shown in Table 1. The condition where wax<br>
being contained in the colorant (Imagio Neo C285) is expressed as "wax"<br>
and the condition where no wax being contained in the colorant (Imagio<br>
Neo C385) is expressed as "non-wax". In a condition of "non-wax", the<br>
condition where silicone oil being fed to the fixing roller was also carried<br>
out.<br>
Conditions:<br>
Process linear speed: 130 mm/sec<br>
Fixing roller temperature: 170°C<br>
Fixing roller pressure: 15 N/cm2<br>
The resulting images were evaluated in accordance with the<br>
following methods.<br><br>

(c)	Image-Fixing Ability I (Smear Process)<br>
A gray-scale image (area rate: 30%) was rubbed 10 times by a<br>
white cloth attached to a clock meter, and the image density of the cloth<br>
was measured by the reflective densitometer (by Gretag MacBeth Co.),<br>
while subtracting the density of the cloth itself.<br>

circularly on a green solid image, then the existence of image peeling was<br>
visually evaluated.<br>
Criterion of Peeling<br>
A: narrow and slight peeling, or no peeling<br>
B: narrow peeling at about 20% of needle traces<br>
C: peeling at more than 20% of needle traces<br>
Removal of Image Forming Material<br>
The image forming materials formed on recording media were<br>
removed with respect to images formed on the recording media of<br>
Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 9 by use of the image<br>
erasing apparatus shown in FIG. 4. The removal of the image forming<br>
materials was carried out up to 20 times while forming substantially<br>
same images as described above on the same recording media.<br>
The conditions to remove image forming materials are as follows:<br>
Conditions:<br>
Process linear speed (velocity of peeling member) : 40 mm/sec<br>
Image Removing Portion at Upstream<br>
Peeling member: polyimide film of 100 m thick<br>
Cleaning Blade: four-groove spiral cleaning blade, cutting steel,<br>
diameter 25 mm<br>
Surface of cleaning backup roller: urethane sponge<br><br>
Rotating direction of blade: reverse to that of peeling member<br>
Heating roller: 135°C<br>
Image Removing Portion at Downstream<br>
Peeling member: polyimide film of 100 m thick on which black<br>
toner (by Ricoh Co, Imagio Neo C385 colorant) being thermally fixed to<br>
25m thick<br>
Pressing roller for image forming materials: central diameter 30 mm,<br>
which being larger by 0.5 mm than edge face<br>
Heating roller: 110°C<br>
The image erasing property was evaluated in a way that solid<br>
images of yellow, magenta, cyan and black were erased, and the<br>
remaining image densities were measured by the reflective densitometer<br>
(by Gretag MacBeth Co.). The evaluation was carried out for the highest<br>
remaining density, while subtracting the density of unused recording<br>
media themselves.<br>
Criterion of Image Erasing Property (Remaining Image Density)<br>
A: ≤0.02<br>
B: 0.03 to 0.09<br>
C: 0.10 to 0.29<br>
D: 0.30<br><br><br><br>
The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the inventive<br>
recording media, produced with treatment liquids comprising polymers<br>
having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 8 or more, may<br>
represent superior fixing ability as well as excellent image erasing<br>
property, and be reusable under sequential image forming/erasing<br>
processes without impairing their quality. The recording medium of<br>
Comparative Example 5, which being produced with the Treatment<br>
Liquid 5 usable in the present invention, exhibited relatively superior<br>
fixing ability as well as excellent image erasing property in a condition<br>
of image forming materials with no wax as well as the image forming<br>
apparatus which supplying silicone oil to the fixing device; however,<br>
offset occurred even on the virgin recording medium when no silicone<br>
oil being supplied.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The inventive method for reusing a recording medium may<br>
allow repetitive use of recording media in particular paper on which<br>
images are repeatedly formed and erased, therefore, contribute to<br>
saving of energy and resource. The image forming process may be<br>
electrophotographic processes, toner-jet processes and ion-flow<br>
processes provided that the image forming materials comprises a<br>
thermoplastic resin, thus the present invention may be widely utilized<br>
in the art. The inventive reusable recording media, methods for<br>
producing the reusable recording media and image forming<br><br>
apparatuses may contribute to saving of energy and resource in a<br>
similar manner under different aspects.<br><br>
