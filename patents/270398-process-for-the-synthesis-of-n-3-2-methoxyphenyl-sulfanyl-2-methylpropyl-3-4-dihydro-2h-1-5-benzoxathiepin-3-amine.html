				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF N-[3-[(2-METHOXYPHENYL)SULFANYL]-2-METHYLPROPYL]-3,4-DIHYDRO-2H-1,5-BENZOXATHIEPIN-3-AMINE<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of the compound of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
its addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids or organic acids and hydrates of those addition salts, and also tautomeric forms thereof, enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers and pure stereoisomers or stereoisomers in mixtures whether racemic or not. The new process applies preferably to the compound (1) , wherein the stereogenic carbon atom of the 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzoxathiepine fragment is of absolute configuration (R) and that of the propyl chain is of absolute configuration (S) . The descriptors (R) and (S) used to specify the absolute configuration of the stereogenic atoms contained in the molecule of formula (1) are defined as in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule (E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chap. 5, 104-12, 1994).<br>
In an especially advantageous embodiment of the invention, the selected stereoisomer of compound (1) is: (3R)-N-{(2S)-3-[(2-methoxyphenyl)sulfanyl]-2-methylpropyl}-3,4-dihydro-2H-l,5-benzoxathiepin-3-amine ;<br>
its addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids or organic acids and hydrates of those addition salts. In the present invention, a stereoisomer is considered to be pure if it is associated with less than 1% of another stereoisomer or mixture of other stereoisomers (i.e., a diastereoisomeric excess of &gt; 98%, 1'actualite chimique 2003, 11/12, 10-4).<br>
The compound of formula (1) is described in Patent Application WO 02/081464, where it is claimed as being useful in the treatment of stable angina, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT syndrome of congenital origin, myocardial infarction and disorders of cardiac rhythm. In that Application, the compound of formula (1) is obtained by reductive amination between the compound of formula (2) and the aldehyde of formula (5) in accordance with the following Scheme I:<br>
SchemeI<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
However, this reductive amination reaction is problematic because of the chemical and stereochemical instability of the aldehyde of formula (5). In addition, because of the nature of some of the reagents used and also that of some of the sub-products formed, this procedure is difficult to perform on an industrial level.<br>
In the synthesis process described in the Application WO 05/103027, the compound of formula (1) is prepared in accordance with Scheme II by reduction of the amide of formula (6), which is chemically and stereochemically stable. The advantage of that process lies essentially in the fact that it is robust, can be performed on an industrial level and can therefore be potentially used in the production of large quantities of compound (1), unlike the process shown in WO 02/081464.<br>
Scheme I_I<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
However, although that process can be performed on an industrial level, it does have two major disadvantages limiting, or considerably complicating, the exploitation thereof:<br>
•	The final step in the WO 05/103027 process involves<br>
the   reduction   of   an   amide   function   to   the<br>
corresponding  amine  by means  of  a borane  complex<br>
(BH3.THF)  in  the  hot  state.  Under  the  synthesis<br>
conditions  required to bring about  said reduction<br>
reaction, boron hydride (BHa) can give rise to diborane<br>
B2H6, which is toxic, extremely flammable and explosive<br>
(INRS,  FT No.  188,  1987). Because of the potential<br>
risks of toxic effects, fire and explosion due to the<br>
possible formation of B2H6,  strict preventative and<br>
protective measures must be put in place when handling<br>
the BH3.THF complex,  which considerably complicates<br>
exploitation of the process.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that reduction of the amide (6) to the amine (1) by means of reducing agents other than a borane complex (i.e. which cannot give rise to B2Hg) is not satisfactory.<br>
•	Another limiting factor comes from the fact that, in<br>
the process described in WO 05/103027,  synthesis of<br>
the intermediate compound  (6)  involves the use,  as<br>
starting material,  of methyl  (R)-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-<br>
propanoate [72657-23-9], which is difficult to obtain<br>
on an industrial scale.<br>
Perfecting a synthesis process that can be performed industrially without the disadvantages described<br><br>
hereinbefore is accordingly necessary for the preparation of medicaments that are useful in the treatment of stable angina, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT syndrome of congenital origin, myocardial infarction and disorders of cardiac rhythm.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a new process for the synthesis of compound (1) which is free of the limitations described hereinbefore.<br>
The process of the invention, unlike that shown in WO 05/103027, thus no longer involves reduction of an amide function, which reduction requires using a reducing agent of the borane complex type. The safety of the new process is considerably increased as a result.<br>
Another major improvement of the process of the invention lies in the fact that a compound of the (S) -3-halogeno-2-methylpropanol type is used as starting material, which is more readily obtainable on a large scale than the methyl (R)-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanoate used in the process described in WO 05/103027.<br>
Accordingly, in terms of the safety of exploitation and in economic terms, the process of the invention has marked advantages compared to the process described in Patent Application WO 05/103027.<br>
A first aspect of the invention accordingly relates to improvement of the process for the synthesis of the compound of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
This compound is obtained by condensation of the compounds of formulae (2) and (3)<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the radical R represents a methyl group or, preferably, a 4-methylphenyl group, in accordance with Scheme III.<br>
Scheme III<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The preferred stereoisomer of the compounds of formulae (1), (2) and (3) is, in all cases, that wherein the stereogenic carbon atoms of the 3,4-dihydro-2H-l,5-benzoxathiepine fragment and of the chain are of absolute configuration (R) and (S), respectively.<br>
In accordance with the new process of the invention, the amine (2) reacts under heat, preferably from 100 to 200°C, with a compound of formula (3), preferably the tosylate, in the presence of a base, for example a non-nucleophilic nitrogen-containing base such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene.<br>
Replacement of a tosylate group by a primary amine is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry, for example Organic Process Research &amp; development 2005, 9(3), 314. However, in unexpected manner, the reaction of the amine (2) with the tosylate (3) has been found to be remarkably efficient. In fact, in the course of said reaction the formation neither of product resulting from<br><br>
dialkylation of the amine (2) by the tosylate (3) nor of secondary products originating from the elimination of p-toluenesulfonic acid from (3) has been observed. Moreover, under the reaction conditions there is no substantial racemisation, whether as regards the intermediates (2) and (3) or as regards the product (1) formed. It follows therefrom that the product of formula (1) is obtained in satisfactory yield and with satisfactory stereochemical purity. From a technical point of view, carrying out the reaction and processing of the reaction mixture are simple to perform. The process of the invention is accordingly especially suitable for the production of large quantities of the compound of formula (1) .<br>
A second aspect of the invention comprises a process for the synthesis of the new intermediate of formula (3)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in accordance with Scheme IV<br>
                 Scheme IV<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein   the   compound   of   formula    (4) :    3-(2-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-2-methylpropanol<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
is treated with methanesulfonyl chloride or para-toluenesulfonyl chloride, in the presence of an organic or inorganic base such as, for example, pyridine, triethylamine, potassium carbonate or ground anhydrous potassium hydroxide, to yield the compound of formula (3) . The alcohol function of 3-(methoxyphenyl)sulfanyl-2-methylpropanol of formula (4) is thus activated, preferably in the form of a tosylate, to yield the new compound of formula (3). The preferred enantiomer of compounds of formula (3) is that wherein the stereogenic carbon atom is of absolute configuration (S).<br>
The compound of formula (3) is subsequently condensed with the amine (2) to yield compound (1) (Scheme III).<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the intermediate compound of general formula (3)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the radical R is a methyl or, preferably, 4-methylphenyl group.<br>
More especially, the invention relates to the intermediate compound of general formula (3) as described hereinbefore wherein the stereogenic carbon atom of the propyl chain is of absolute configuration (S).<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention without however limiting the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1 : (S)-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)sulfanyl-2-methylpropanol 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (3)<br>
10 ml of methylene chloride, 2 g (9.4 mmol) of (S)-3-(2-methoxyphenylsulfanyl)-2-methylpropanol, 2 g (10.5 mmol) of para-toluenesulfonyl chloride and 115 mg (0.94 mmol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine are introduced into a three-necked flask under an inert atmosphere and 1.2 g (12.1 mmol) of triethylamine are then added dropwise. After stirring for 2 hours at ambient temperature, 10 ml of demineralised water are added. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 by adding 2N hydrochloric acid. The phases are separated and then the organic phase is washed with 10 ml of demineralised water. The organic phase is concentrated under reduced pressure. The yellow oil obtained (3.2 g) is taken up in a mixture of methylene chloride (4.8 ml) and 19.2 ml of isopropyl ether. The precipitate obtained is filtered off and then washed twice with 10 ml of isopropyl ether and dried at 40°C under reduced pressure. The title product (3) is obtained in the form of a white powder 2.6 g (75%).<br>
