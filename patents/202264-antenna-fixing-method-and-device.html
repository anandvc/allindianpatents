				<td>ANTENNA FIXING METHOD AND DEVICE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an antenna fixing method and an antenna fixing device, and more particularly to a construction in which an external thread portion of an antenna holder is connected to an internal thread portion of an antenna holder-receiving member provided on an antenna guide, and in this condition the antenna is mounted on and fixed to a casing, and after the fixing, the antenna can be removed from a body box member by disconnecting the antenna holder from the antenna holder-receiving member by loosing the threads.<br>
A portable terminal equipment, such as a portable cellular telephone and a PHS (Personal Handyphone System), is equipped with an antenna. For mounting this antenna on the portable terminal equipment, a first step is to beforehand fix an antenna holder-receiving member to a body box member. A second step is to insert an antenna body, having an antenna holder integrally connected thereto, into the antenna holder-receiving member. A third step is to screw and connect the antenna holder to an internal thread portion of the antenna holder-receiving member. Thus, this mounting operation is carried out by the three steps.<br>
However, in the above operation, the assembling operation is effected on the body box member, and the operation<br><br>
for inserting the antenna body into the antenna holder-receiving member and the operation for threadedly connecting the antenna holder to the antenna holder-receiving member are not suited for an automated operation, and therefore there has been encountered a problem that the time, required for assembling the portable cellular telephone, can not be reduced.<br>
Fig. 4 is an exploded, perspective view explanatory of a conventional antenna mounting-fixing method. In Fig. 4, in an assembling operation, first, an antenna holder-receiving member 5, having an antenna guide 8 and an antenna terminal 6 connected thereto, is received in a predetermined position in a lower casing 3. In Fig, 4, for showing the assembled condition, although the antenna holder-receiving member 5 is shown as slightly floating relative to the lower casing 3, the antenna holder-receiving member 5 is finally held in intimate contact with the lower casing 3, so that a hole in the antenna holder-receiving member 5 communicates with an antenna body passage hole 7, Thereafter, an upper casing 9 is attached, and the antenna holder-receiving member is held between the lower casing 3 and the upper casing 9,.thereby fixing it.<br>
On the other hand, outside the lower casing 3, there is prepared an antenna body 1 passing through an antenna holder 2, and this is introduced into the antenna body passage hole 7, and is guided to the antenna holder-receiving member 5 mounted within the lower casing 3.<br><br>
Thereafter, an external thread portion, formed on the antenna holder 2, is connected to an internal thread portion, formed on the antenna holder-receiving member 5, through a washer 4. By dosing so, the antenna is mounted and fixed.<br>
However, when the antenna body 1 is bent or broken from some cause while the user uses the portable cellular telephone, the antenna body 1 need to be exchanged. In order to simplify the exchanging operation as much as possible, there has been used, as a method of exchanging the antenna body 1, a standard exchanging method in which the antenna holder 2 is rotated by the use of a special tool so as to loosen the threads, and the antenna body 1, together with the antenna holder 2, is disconnected from the antenna holder-receiving member 5, and a new antenna body 1, having an antenna holder 2 attached thereto, is passed through the antenna holder-receiving member 5, and the antenna holder 2 is rotated to be threadedly connected to the antenna holder-receiving member 5, thereby effecting the mounting operation. This exchanging operation method has already been substantially a standard operation method in the industry, and there has been encountered a problem that it is difficult to change the above conventional structure.<br>
