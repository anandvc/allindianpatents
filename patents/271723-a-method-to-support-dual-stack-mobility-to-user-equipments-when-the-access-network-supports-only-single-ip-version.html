				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of Mobile Networks or networks involving mobility. Further, this invention is related to Wireless networks and terminals that support L3 Mobility using Proxy IPv6 or Proxy Mobile IPv4 and are capable of dual stack IP capability. Particularly, this invention provides a mechanism to support Dual Stack Sessions and Dual Stack mobility when the UE is connected to an access network, which is capable of single IP version when the UE and the home Agent (LMA) support both IP versions. More particularly the present invention relates to a method and system to support dual stack mobility when the access network supports only single ip version.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Proxy Mobile IP is a network based mobility mechanism. It hides the IP layer mobility of the UE from the UE. Thus the network takes care of the proper routing when the UE moves to the new point of attachment.<br>
When PMIPv6 network consists of LMA and MAG the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) is binding agent (similar to the Home Agent of MIP) which keeps the binding entry between the UE's IP address and its present location. MAG is the node, which has L2 connectivity with the UE. When the UE attaches with the MAG, MAG<br>
updates the binding entry in LMA with its own IP address. Thus all the packets for the UE will be tunneled to the MAG, which then transmits the packets over L2 link.<br>
When the UE connects to a network, the first hop router provides with a unicast router advertisement. The prefix advertised for the RA is determined by the UE Identity. The MAG can obtain the prefix to the advertised from the LMA.<br>
For the case of IPv6, the IPv6 address can be configured by the UE using stateless auto-configuration, DHCP or Access Specific protocols. For the case of IPv4, the address is mainly configured using DHCP or Access Specific protocols.<br>
The topology as shown in Figure 1 is considered in this section. The UE is dual stack and so are the MAG and the LMA. Assuming the PMIPv6 is used between the LMA and MAG, the packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are tunneled within an IPv6 tunnel. Thus when the UE connects to the MAG, MAG sends a Binding Update to bind UEs IPv4 and IPv6 IP address with MAG's IPv6 IP Address. Thus when a packet arrives at LMA with the UE IP address, the packet is tunneled to the MAG. The MAG then inspects the packet and tunnels it to the UE on the L2 link.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
If the MAG does not possess dual stack capability, the MAG is incapable of tunneling the IP packets of the version it does not support. For e.g. If the MAG is capable of only IPv4, then UE cannot support IPv6 applications even though UE<br>
and LMA both support IPv6 also. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to the scenario where the UE is connected to the network (MAG), which supports only a single IP version. UE as well as the LMA supports dual stack.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to allow the UE to access application of both IP versions when the UE is dual stack even if the network is capable of single IP version.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method to allocate an IP address for the UE of the IP version which is not supported by MAG.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a mechanism which allows the UE to configure such an IP address and allow the packets of the other IP version to be transmitted over the MAG.<br>
The invention relates to the field of mobile networks and terminals that support L3 mobility by using proxy Mobile IP. In particular, the invention proposes a mechanism to support dual stack mobility when a dual stack User Equipment (UE) is connected to an access network capable of a single IP version (IPv4 or IPv6).<br>
When a dual stack UE i.e. a UE that supports both IPv4 and IPv6, is connected to an access network (by means of a Mobile Access Gateway) that supports a single IP version (e.g. IPv4), packets of the other IP version (e.g.lPv6) cannot be tunnelled through the access network. Thus, the UE cannot support IPv6 applications even though the UE and its Local Mobility Agent (LMA) both support IPv6. According to the invention, in order to access IPv6 packets in an IPv4 network (or vice versa), the UE initiates Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) procedure to establish a tunnel between the UE and the LMA. IKE_Auth messages are exchanged between the UE and the LMA (via MAG). The UE IPv6 address is informed as a part pf the IKE_Auth messages. The UE may then access IPv6 packets tunnelled inside the IPv4 packets.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method to support dual stack mobility in an access network supporting single IP version comprising the steps of:<br>
connecting to the access network by UE and attaching to a MAG using access specific procedures;<br>
sending a proxy registration request to a LMA by MAG and mapping a first IP version address of the UE to the IP address of the MAG by a binding cache entry in the LMA;<br>
sending a DHCP request to request for an IP address by the UE;<br>
replying back with the first IP version address by MAG as allocated by the<br>
LMA;<br>
allocating a first IP version address to UE after the network informing the<br>
UE IP address as part of the attach procedure; requests the HA IP address by UE using DHCP; initiating the IKEv2 init procedure by UE; and informing second IP version as part of IKE_Auth exchange.<br>
The access specific procedure includes an MN ID to be informed to the access network. The method further comprising a proxy RRQ including MN ID to identify the UE. The method further comprising the steps of making available a binding cache entry between a UE ID, UE IP address and the MAG address if the UE was already connected in the domain and was allocated an IP address. The method further comprising completing SA creation by UE with exchange of IKE_Auth messages between the UE and MAG. The LMA contains an IPsec SA which maps the second IP version address of the UE to the first IP version address allocated to the UE.<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a system to support dual stack mobility in an access network supporting single IP version comprising :<br>
UE connecting to the access network and attaching to a MAG using access specific procedures;<br>
MAG sending a proxy registration request to a LMA and mapping a first IP version address of the UE to the IP address of the MAG by a binding cache entry in the LMA, wherein the UE sends a DHCP request to request for an IP address and the MAG replying back with the first IP version address as<br>
allocated by the LMA;<br>
means for allocating a first IP version address to UE after the network informing the UE IP address as part of the attach procedure; a DHCP used by UE for requesting the HA IP address, wherein the UE initiates the IKEv2 init procedure by UE and informs second IP version as part of IKE_Auth exchange.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for allowing dual stack UE to access applications of both IP versions irrespective of the IP version supported by the network. Consider the topology as shown in Figure 2, both UE and the LMA are dual stack and the MAG is only IPv4 capable. The MAG uses Proxy MIPv6 protocol to hide the UE nobilities within the PMIPv6 domain.<br>
The method as shown in Figure 3 is detailed below:<br>
Step 1: UE connects to the network and attaches to the MAG using Access specific procedures. The procedure includes the MN ID to be informed to the network.<br>
Step 2: MAG sends the proxy registration request to the LMA. The proxy RRQ includes MN ID to identify the UE.<br>
Step3: If the UE was already connected in the domain and was allocated an IP address, the binding cache entry between the UE ID, UE IP address and the MAG address will be available. If the entry is not available then a new IP address is allocated. In this case, since the UE is connecting for the first time in the domain, the UE is allocated an IPv4 address. (Since MAG is not capable of IPv6, the request for IPv6 is not included). The Binding Cache Entry in the LMA maps the IPv4 address of the UE to the IP address of the MAG.<br>
Step 4: The UE sends a DHCP request to request for an IP address. The DHCP is gated in the MAG.<br>
Step 5: The MAG replies back with the IPv4 address as allocated by the LMA. Thus now the UE has a topological^ correct IPv4 address.<br>
Step 6: The network informs the UE IP address as part of the attach procedure. After this step the UE is allocated an IPv4 address.<br>
Step 7: Since UE is dual stack and the network has allocated only an IPv4 address, the UE requests the HA IP address using DHCP.<br>
Step 8: The UE initiates the IKEv2 init procedure as specified in IKEv2 RFC.<br>
Step 9 &amp;10: The UE completes the SA creation with exchange of IKE_Auth messages between the UE and MAG. The UE IPv6 address is informed as part IKE_Auth exchange. The IPv6 address allocated by the LMA belongs topologically to the LMA. The LMA contains an IPsec SA which maps the IPv6 address of the UE to the IPv4 address allocated to the same UE.<br>
Thus, UE is able to access both IP versions irrespective of the IP version supported by the MAG.<br>
When the UE receives an IPv4 packet, the processing of the packet will trigger the IPv4 BCE and the packet is tunneled to the MAG. MAG then processes the packet normally and delivers it to the UE.<br>
When the UE receives a IPv6 packet, IPsec SA is triggered while processing. The IPsec SA tunnels the packet to the IPv4 address allocated to the UE. The IPv4 packet address to the UE in turn triggers the IPv4 BCE for the UE. This IPv6 in IPv4 packet is tunneled to the MAG. MAG processes the packet normally and delivers to the UE. UE detunnels the IPv6 packet and obtains the IPv6 packet.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
