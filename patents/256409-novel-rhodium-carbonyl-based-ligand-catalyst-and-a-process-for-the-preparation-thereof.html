				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel rhodium carbonyl based ligand catalyst. It also relates to a process for the preparation of novel rhodium(l) carbonyl complexes containing singly charged bidentate nitrogen-oxygen donors ligands useful as carbonylation catalysts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process preparation of new rhodium(l) carbonyl complexes of ligands containing aromatic hetero backbone. The rhodium carbonyl complexes prepared by the present invention are useful as catalyst precursors for carbonylation of alcohol to carboxylic acid and ester.<br>
Reference may be made to the workDenise et. al. (J. Organomet. Chem, 63, 1973, 423) wherein a few pyridine or substituted pyridine complexes of rhodium metal of the type [Rh(COD)CIL] (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene; L = pyridine, 2-vinyl pyridine, 2-methyl pyridine, 4-methyl pyridine) have reported. The drawback of the work is that it did not disclose any catalytic activities of the complexes.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Lawson &amp; Wilkinson (J. Chem. Soc. A, 1965, 1900) wherein they disclosed the preparation of few rhodium(l) carbonyl complexes of pyridine or chloro pyridine. The drawback of the work is that it did not disclose any catalytic activities of the complexes.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Ugo et. al. (J. Organomet. Chem, 11, 1968,159) wherein a few nitrogen-oxygen donors complexes of rhodium metal of the type (CO)2Rh(Chel); Chel = 8-oxyquinolate, quinaldinate, a-pyridinecarboxylate, salicylaldoximate) have been reported. The drawbacks are that they did not report any non chelating carbonyl complexes and also there was no disclosure of any catalytic application.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Chen et.al. (Trans. Met. Chem., 19, 1994, 418) wherein they have reported dicarbonyl complexes of the type [Rh(CO)2(LL/)] where LL' = salicylaldoximate, 8-oxyquinolinate, glycinate,<br><br>
leucinate, aminophenolate or pyridine carboxylate and their catalytic activity towards hydroformylation of styrene at atmospheric pressure of CO : H2 (1:1). The drawback is that they did not disclose the carbonylation catalysis.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Sivasubramanian et. al. (Trans. Met. Chem., 1982, 7, 346) wherein they reported the first metal-nitrone complex (i.e.metal complexes of nitrogen-oxygen donors ligands) where metals are used from the 1st row transition metal series. Other few reports of metal nitrone complex appeared in literature e.g. Frederick et. al. (Inorg. Chem. 37, 1998, 1446, J. Chem. Soc., Da/ton Trans., 1998, 4055) and Thirumalaikumar et. al. (Indian J. Chem, 38A, 1999, 720). No catalytic evaluation was reported.<br>
Since the first report of catalysis by [Rh(CO)2l2]" (F. E. Paulik and J. F. Roth, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1968, 1578), there has been little improvement on the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Attempt to develop new catalysis species have been hampered by the relatively harsh condition under which the reaction is conducted commercially (150-200 °C, 25-45 atm., in the presence of I") because under such conditions, virtually any source of rhodium will be converted to [Rh(CO)2l2]" (D. Forster, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1976, 98, 846).<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,329 issued to F. E. Paulik et. al. wherein methanol is carbonylated with carbon monoxide gas at 175 °C and 1000 psig pressure to acetic acid using the catalyst [Rh(CO)2l2]" - The process is similar to existing industrial condition(as above) for conducting the reaction and therefore the same drawback persists.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. 4,990,654 issued to Wegman et. al. wherein they disclosed production of acetate ester from alcohol using rhodium complex catalysts. The process comprises catalytic reaction of a mixture of methanol and ethanol and carbon monoxide in contact with a homogeneous catalyst of rhodium complex containing the ligands like Ph2P(CH2)nP(O)Ph2 (Ph = phenyl, n = 1-4) or Ph2P(CH2)nC(0)R or Ph2P(CH2)nCOOR (R=alkyl/aryl). The reaction was carried out at a temperature up to 130°C and reaction pressure up<br><br>
to about 250 psig.    The main drawback of the process is that methanol conversion is only 70 %.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Wegman et.al. (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1987, 1891) wherein carbonylation in presence of catalyst [Rh(CO)2CI(Ph2P(CH2)2P(O)Ph2)] was carried out at 80°C and 50 psig CO. The turnover frequency was 400 h"1. The drawbacks are that they did not report the percentage of methanol conversion and the selectivity.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S.Pat. 5,488,153 issued to Baker et.al. wherein they claimed a process for the liquid phase carbonylation of methanol in presence of CO, a halogen promoter ( e.g. CH3I), water, rhodium complexes of Ph2PCH2P(S)Ph2 or 2-(diphenylphosphino)thiophenol. The reaction was performed in the temperature range of 25 - 250°C and at a pressure in the range 10 to 200 bar. The carbonylation rate was found to be considerably higher i.e. about 6 times higher than that in absence of the ligand in the system. The drawback of the process is that it involves higher temperature and pressure.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Cavell et. al (US Pat. 5352813) wherein an improved process for the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid and or its ester using a catalyst precursor composed of transition metal complex containing a hetero functional bidentate phosphorous-nitrogen donors ligand under CO pressure of 40 psi. and at 80 °C have been disclosed. The drawback is that the patent did not claim any yield of the catalytic reaction process.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Baker et.al. (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Soc., 1995, 197) wherein disclosed the catalytic activity of a catalyst c/'s-Rhl(CO)Ph2PCH2P(S)Ph2 which is about 8 times more active than the classic Monsanto catalyst [Rh(CO)2l2]~ for carbonylation of methanol at 185°C and at 70 bar pressure. The draw back of the process is that it required high temperature and pressure.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Dilworth et.al. (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1995, 1579) wherein they claimed that use of rhodium(l) complexes<br><br>
containing phosphinothiolate and thioether ligands resulted about 4 times higher rate in carbonylation of methanol to ethanoic acid than that of [Rh(CO)2l2]"- The reaction was carried out at 185°C and at 70 bar pressure. The draw back of the process is that it involves high temperature and pressure.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S.Pat No. 5,973,197 issued to Denis et. al. wherein a method for preparing carboxylic acids by carbonylation of an alcohol in presence of rhodium complex catalyst have been disclosed. The carbonylation reaction was conducted at a temperature in the range 150 - 250°C and 1-100 bar pressures. Again the main drawback is the involvement of drastic reaction condition.<br>
Since the discovery, Monsanto catalyst [RlXCOhh]" is still preferred as commercial catalyst for carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid. It is well known that a complex to act as an efficient catalyst, it should possess high electron density on the metal center which can be achieved by introducing different types of electron donor ligands in the metal complex species. It is anticipated that a 'Hard' donors like nitrogen and oxygen atom would increase the electron density on the central rhodium atom causing the complexes to behave as an efficient catalyst.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide novel rhodium carbonyl complexes of nitrogen-oxygen donors based ligands useful as carbonylation catalysts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing rhodium(l) complexes containing electron rich ligand oxygen and Nitrogen donor atoms, as efficient catalyst precursors for carbonylation of alcohol to acid and/or ester.<br><br>
