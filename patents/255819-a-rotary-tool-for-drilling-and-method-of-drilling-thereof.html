PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following complete specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to cutting tools for drilling blind and through hole in rubber and method of drilling blind hole in rubber. Cutting of rubber for making hole (blind or through) is very difficult with the normal cutting tools. A new cutting tool for this purpose has been developed to make holes in the rubber parts for the prototype applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The elastic properties of Rubber make it difficult to be cut with normal cutting tools (drills etc). Rubber elasticity, also known as hyper elasticity, describes the mechanical behavior of many polymers, especially those with cross-linking. Invoking the theory of rubber elasticity, one considers a polymer chain in a cross-linked network as an entropic spring. When the chain is stretched, the entropy is reduced by a large margin because there are fewer conformations available. Therefore, there is a restoring force, which causes the polymer chain to return to its equilibrium or unstretched state, such as a high entropy random coil configuration, once the external force is removed. This is the reason why rubber bands return to their original state.<br>
There are lots of parts in the automobile industry which are made of rubber and to machine these for proto applications is another challenge. Earlier for any modification in the existing geometry of the rubber parts, used to do this with heated MS rods, e.g. if the hole on the existing part to be modified then one MS rod used to be heated to certain temp and then it used to be inserted in the part to enlarge the hole.<br>
This process had the following disadvantages :-<br>
1.	The foul smell of burning of rubber used to spoil the atmosphere.<br>
2.	The quality of the holes was very poor.<br><br><br>
3.  The desired accuracy levels were not met. So to counter these problems one new cutter is developed.<br>
Conventional through hole cutting tools cannot be used since the tools tends to shear the rubber material and removal of sliced material is also not efficient. These advantages can be overcome by designing new cutting tools which can drill blind and through holes efficiently in rubber by removing material from the hole without shearing the same.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to develop a tool which can be used for drill through hole in rubber like material.<br>
Another object of this invention is to develop a tool which can be used to drilling blind hole in rubber like material.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide for a method of drilling blind hole in rubber material.<br>
