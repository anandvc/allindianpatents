				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION EXHIBITING<br>
ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Toluene sulfonamide is known to be a highly effective anti-fungal agent, and is<br>
useful for treating plant and animal (e.g., human) tissues infected with a fungus. For<br>
instance, U. S. Patent No. 3,340,148 to Pugh discloses that para-toluene sulfonamide is<br>
highly effective as a topical agent for treatment of fungal skin diseases.<br>
[0002] U.S. Patent No. 5,291,454 to W11 discloses a toluene sulfonamide-containing<br>
composition that exhibits anti-cancer and tumor necrotizing activity. That patent discloses<br>
that the minimum effective concentration oi toluene sulfonamide in such a composition is<br>
10% by weight The present invention relates to efficacious anti-cancer compositions that<br>
were not previously described by others.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that exhibits anti-tumor<br>
activity. The composition comprises less than 10%, by weight, (or less than 9%, 7%, 3%, or<br>
1%) ef a toluene sulfonamide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier can,<br>
for example, be an injectable carrier or an or ally-administrable carrier. The precise identity<br>
of the toluene sulfonamide is not critical. The sulfonamide moiety can be in the meta-,<br>
ortho-, or para- position, and the nitrogen atom can be substituted with two hydride radicals.<br>
One or both of the hydride radicals can be replaced by a C1 to C6 straight, branched, or<br>
cyclic organic radical. Examples of suitable toluene sulfonamides include para-toluene<br>
sulfonamide, ortho-toluene sulfonamide, meta-toluene sulfonamide, N-ethyl ortho-toluene<br>
sulfonamide, N-ethyl para-toluene sulfonamide, and N-cyclohexyl para-toluene<br>
sulfonamide. The composition can comprise two or more toluene sulfonamides.<br>
[0004] The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises one or more additional<br>
ingredients. Suitable ingredients include 0-9)% (w/w) polyethylene glycol, 0-90% (w/w) 2-<br>
ethyl-13-hexanediol, 0-90% (w/w) propanediol, 0-50% (w/w) decanedioic acid, 0-25%<br>
(w/w) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0-50% (w/w) ethanol, honey, a surfactant, and an emulsifier.<br><br>
[0005] The invention also includes a method of making the pharmaceutical composition<br>
exhibiting anti-tumor activity. The method comprises combining a toluene sulfonamide and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form the composition.<br>
[0006] In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of inhibiting growth of a<br>
tumor in a human patient. This method c omprises administering to the patient the<br>
pharmaceutical composition described herein, i.e., one comprising less than 10%, by weight,<br>
of a toluene sulfonamide. Administraton of the composition to the patient inhibits growth<br>
of the tumor. The composition can be orally administered to the patient, infused into a<br>
blood vessel of the patient, injected at a tumor site in the patient, or topically applied at a<br>
tumor site.<br>
[0007] The pharmaceutical composition described herein can also be used to shrink a<br>
tumor in a human patient who has a tumor, or to prevent tumorigenesis in a human patient<br>
who does not have, or is not recognized as having, a tumor.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] The foregoing summary, as we 1 as the following detailed description of<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction<br>
with the appended drawings. The invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and<br>
instrumentalities shown in the drawings.<br>
[0009] Figure 1, consisting of Figures . A and 1B is a pair of radiographic images of the<br>
narrowed esophageal lumen of the patient referred to herein as Patient 1. The images were<br>
made during consumption by Patient I of a barium-containing meal, and indicate that the<br>
upper portion of the patient's esophagus was narrowed along 8 to 9 centimeters of its length<br>
by the cauliflower-like mass observed therein. The images shown in Figures 1A and 1B<br>
were made prior to commencing administration of a toluene sulfonamide-containing<br>
composition described herein.<br>
[0010] Figure 2 is a radiographic image of the upper portion of the esophagus of Patient<br>
1 about 43 months after beginning administration of a para-toluene sulfonamide-containing<br>
composition described herein. The image was made during ingestion of a barium-<br>
containing meal, and indicates the smooth, normal state of the patient's previously<br>
obstructed esophagus.<br><br><br>
[0011] Figure 3, consisting of Figurs 3A, 3B, and 3C, is a trio of radiographic images<br>
of the upper portion of the esophagus of the patient referred to herein as Patient 2. The<br>
images were made during ingestion of a barium-containing meal and indicate that the<br>
patient's esophagus was narrowed along about 10 centimeters of its length. These images<br>
were made prior to commencing administration of a toluene sulfonamide-containing<br>
composition described herein.<br>
[0012] Figure 4 is a radiographic image of the upper portion of the esophagus of Patient<br>
2 about one week after emplacement of an intra-luminal trans-esophageal stent in the<br>
patient's esophagus. Administration of a oluene sulfonamide-containing composition<br>
described herein was commenced immediately after emplacing the intra-luminal trans-<br>
esophageal stent. The image was made during ingestion of a barium-containing meal, and<br>
indicates that esophageal contents could freely pass through the esophagus after the stent<br>
had been emplaced, indicating that food and the composition described herein can be<br>
administered to the esophagus, including to the cancer-constricted portion.<br>
[0013] Figure 5, consisting of Figures 5A and 5B, is a pair of radiographic images of the<br>
upper portion of the esophagus of Patient 2 about 14 months after beginriing administration<br>
of a para-toluene sulfonamide-containing composition described herein. The images were<br>
made during ingestion of a barium-containing meal, and indicated the smooth, normal<br>
passage of a barium-containing meal through the patient's stented esophagus. The image<br>
illustrates that the esophageal passage was in good condition, and that the esophageal<br>
cancerous growth was suppressed and no longer obstructed the esophagus. Normally,<br>
without the treatment as described herein (i. e., by administration of a para-toluene<br>
sulfonamide-containing composition), the emplaced stent would be squeezed and narrowed<br>
by growth of the esophageal tumor, and the stented passage would be severely obstructed.<br>
The results shown in this Figure indicates th at the composition containing para-toluene<br>
sulfonamide inhibited growth of the cancer in the patient<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] One of the inventors previously d isclosed (i.e., in U.S. Patent No. 5,891,454) that<br>
toluene sulfonamides are efficacious anti-tumor agent, at least in specialized compositions.<br>
However, it was believed that 10%, by weight, was the minimum content of toluene<br>
sulfonamide that could be used to make an efficacious pharmaceutical composition. In the<br><br><br>
present invention, the inventors have discovered that efficacious anti-tumor compositions<br>
can contain less than 10%, by weight, of a toluene sulfonamide.<br>
[0015] Anti-Tumor Pharmaceutical (Compositions<br>
[0016] The invention includes a pharmaceutical composition that exhibits anti-tumor<br>
activity, including tumor growth-inhibiting activity, tumor shrinking (necrotizing) activity,<br>
and tumor-preventive activity. The composition comprises a toluene sulfonamide at a<br>
concentration of less than 10%, by weight, of the composition. The composition also<br>
comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, the carrier is<br>
preferably either an injectable (or infusible) carrier or an orally-adrninistrable (i.e.,<br>
swallowable, chewable, or edible) carrier. The pharmaceutical composition can contain<br>
other ingredients as well, such as are knovn in the art or described elsewhere in this<br>
disclosure.<br>
[0017] One advantage of toluene sulfonamides is that they are generally relatively<br>
harmless to non-cancerous cells and tissue::, even when administered in large amounts or in<br>
relatively high concentration. For example, normal (i.e., non-neoplastic) cells exhibit<br>
almost no histopathological changes when exposed to para-toluene sulfonamide. Toluene<br>
sulfonamides are highly toxic to neoplastic cells, however, and the efficacy of these<br>
compounds for anti-cancer purposes relates to this toxicity.<br>
[0018] The toluene sulfonamide has the following general formula, wherein the 'floating<br>
bond between the sulfur atom and the toluene moiety indicates that the sulfonamide moiety<br>
can be present at any one of the meta-, ortho-, and para- positions.<br><br>
wherein each of R1 and R2 is -H, or a C1 to C6 linear, branched, or cyclic moiety.<br>
[0019] The toluene sulfonamide is a toluene molecule substituted, at either the ortho- or<br>
para-position with a sulfonamide moiety. The nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide moiety can<br>
have a lower alkyl or cycloalkyl moiety (i.e.,i C1 to C6 linear, branched, or cyclic moiety)<br>
bound thereto. Examples of toluene sulfonamides include para-toluene sulfonamide (i.e.,<br>
the sulfonamide moiety is at the para- position and each of R1 and R2 is -H), ortho-toluene<br><br><br>
sulfonamide, N-ethyl ortho-toluene sulfonamide (i.e., R1 is an ethyl radical and R2 is -If),<br>
N-ethyl para-toluene sulfonamide, and N-cyclohexyl para-toluene sulfonamide (i.e., R1 is a<br>
cyclohexyl {-C6H11) radical and R2 is -H). Other useful toluene sulfonamides can be<br>
identified simply by confirming their effi :acy using the tests described in this disclosure.<br>
[0020] The pharmaceutical composition can comprise more than one toluene<br>
sulfonamide. When the composition includes more than one toluene sulfonamide, the sum<br>
of the concentrations of the individual toluene sulfonamides is preferably less than 10%, by<br>
weight, of the composition.<br>
[0021 ] The precise amount of the toluene sulfonamide(s) present in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is not critical, other than that the total content of toluene sulfonamides should<br>
be less than 10%, by weight, of the composition. In certain embodiments, the total content<br>
is less than 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
The toluene sulfonamide content of the composition can be as low as necessary in order to<br>
preserve the palatability of an orally-administered pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Nevertheless, the concentration of toluene sulfonamide in an orally-administered<br>
pharmaceutical composition should be maintained at the highest level (less than 10%) that<br>
preserves palatability of the composition, so that the efficacy of the composition can be<br>
maximized. If the composition is anticipated to be readily consumable in large (e.g., multi-<br>
gram or multi-decagram) amounts, then, of course, the absolute concentration of the toluene<br>
sulfonamide in the composition is less critical, owing to the amount of the composition that<br>
can be administered to a patient.<br>
[0022] Other contemplated ingredients o "the pharmaceutical composition include, for<br>
example, polyethylene glycol, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanedioI, propanediol, decanedioic acid,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, honey, a surfactimt (i.e., other than, or in addition to, honey),<br>
and an emulsifier. Examples of suitable surfactants include honey, hexadecanol,<br>
propanediol alginate, glycerol monostearate, and xylitan monostearate. Examples of<br>
suitable emulsifiers include hexadecanol, TWEEN™ surfactants (e.g., TWEEN20™),<br>
lecithin, and other known emulsifying agents.<br>
[0023] The invention encompasses the preparation and use of medicaments and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising less than 10%, by weight, of a toluene<br>
sulfonamide as an active ingredient. Such a pharmaceutical composition may consist of the<br>
active ingredient alone, in a form suitable for administration to a subject, or the<br><br><br>
pharmaceutical composition may comprise the active ingredient and one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, one or more additional ingredients, or some<br>
combination of these. Administration of one of these pharmaceutical compositions to a<br>
subject is useful for inhibiting tumor growth, for shrinking tumors, and for preventing<br>
tumorigenesis in the human subjects, as described elsewhere in the present disclosure. The<br>
active ingredient may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in the form of a<br>
physiologically acceptable ester or salt, such as in combination with a physiologically<br>
acceptable cation or anion, as is well known in the art.<br>
[0024] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means a chemical<br>
composition with which the active ingredient may be combined and which, following the<br>
combination, can be used to administer the active ingredient to a subject.<br>
[0025] As used herein, the term "physiologically acceptable" ester or salt means an ester<br>
or salt form of the active ingredient which is compatible with any other ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition and which is not deleterious to the subject to which the<br>
composition is to be administered.<br>
[0026] The formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be<br>
prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In<br>
general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into<br>
association with a carrier or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary<br>
or desirable, shaping or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.<br>
[0027] Although the descriptions of phar maceutical compositions provided herein are<br>
principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for ethical<br>
administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions<br>
are generally suitable for administration to animals of all sorts. Modification of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the<br>
compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the<br>
ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and perform such modification with<br>
merely ordinary, if any, experimentation.<br>
[0028] Pharmaceutical compositions that are useful in the methods of the invention may<br>
be prepared, packaged, or sold in formulatior s suitable for oral, nasal, rectal, vaginal,<br>
parenteral, topical, pulmonary, intranasal, buccal, ophthalmic, or another route of<br>
administration. Other contemplated formulations include projected nanoparticles, liposomal<br><br><br>
preparations, reseated erythrocytes contaning the active ingredient, and immunologically-<br>
based formulations.<br>
[0029J A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a<br>
"unit dose" is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is<br>
generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a<br>
subject or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third<br>
of such a dosage.<br>
[0030] The relative amounts of the act ive ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, and any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will<br>
vary, depending upon the identity, size, an J condition of the subject treated and further<br>
depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of<br>
example, the composition may comprise between 0.1 % and 100% (w/w) active ingredient.<br>
A unit dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will generally comprise from<br>
about 100 milligrams to about 10 grams of the active ingredient<br>
[0031] Controlled- or sustained-release formulations of a pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the invention may be made using conventional technology.<br>
[0032] A formulation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention suitable for oral<br>
administration may be prepared, packaged, or sold in the form of a discrete solid dose unit<br>
including, but not limited to, a tablet, a hard or soft capsule, a cachet, a troche, or a lozenge,<br>
each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Other formulations<br>
suitable for oral administration include, but are not limited to, a powdered or granular<br>
formulation, an aqueous or oily suspension, an aqueous or oily solution, or an emulsion.<br>
[0033] As used herein, an "oily" liquid i s one which comprises a carbon-containing<br>
liquid molecule and which exhibits a less polar character than water.<br>
[0034] A tablet comprising the active ingredient may, for example, be made by<br>
compressing or molding the active ingredient, optionally with one or more additional<br>
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable device, the<br>
active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granular preparation, optionally<br>
mixed with one or more of a binder, a lubricant, an excipient, a surface active agent, and a<br>
dispersing agent Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable device, a mixture<br><br><br>
of the active ingredient, a pharmaceutical!} acceptable carrier, and at least sufficient liquid<br>
to moisten the mixture. Pharmaceutically itcceptable excipients used in the manufacture of<br>
tablets include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, granulating and disintegrating agents,<br>
binding agents, and lubricating agents. Known disposing agents include, but are not<br>
limited to, potato starch and sodium starch &gt;lycolate. Known surface active agents include,<br>
but are not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate Known diluents include, but are not limited to,<br>
calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lacto; e, microciystalline cellulose, calcium<br>
phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium phosphate. Known granulating and<br>
disintegrating agents include, but are not lirr ited to, com starch and alginic acid. Known<br>
binding agents include, but are not limited to, gelatin, acacia, pre-gelatinized maize starch,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and hydroxypropyl m
include, but are not limited to, magnesium stsarate, stearic acid, silica, and talc.<br>
[0035] Tablets may be non-coated or the / may be coated using known methods to<br>
achieve delayed disintegration in the gastroir testinal tract of a subject, thereby providing<br>
sustained release and absorption of the active ingredient. By way of example, a material<br>
such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distrearate may be used to coat tablets. Further by<br>
way of example, tablets may be coated using methods described in U.S. Patents numbers<br>
4,256,108; 4,160,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotically-controlled release tablets.<br>
Tablets may further comprise a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a<br>
preservative, or some combination of these in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and<br>
palatable preparation.<br>
[0036] Hard capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a<br>
physiologically degradable composition, such as gelatin. Such hard capsules comprise the<br>
active ingredient, and may further comprise additional ingredients including, for example,<br>
an inert solid diluent such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or kaolin.<br>
[0037] Soft gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a<br>
physiologically degradable composition, such as gelatin. Such soft capsules comprise the<br>
active ingredient, which may be mixed with water or an oil medium such as peanut oil,<br>
liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
[0038] Oral compositions may be made, using known technology, which specifically<br>
release orally-administered agents in the small or large intestines, esophagus, or stomach of<br>
a human patient. For example, formulations for delivery to the gastrointestinal system,<br><br><br>
including the colon, include enteric coated systems, based, e.g., on methacrylate copolymers<br>
such as poly(methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate), which are only soluble at pH 6 and<br>
above, so that the polymer only begins to dissolve on entry into the small intestine. The site<br>
where such polymer formulations disintegrate is dependent on the rate of intestinal transit<br>
and the amount of polymer present. For example, a relatively thick polymer coating is used<br>
for delivery to the proximal colon (Hardy et al., 1987 Aliment. Pharmacol. Therap. 1:273-<br>
280). Polymers capable of providing site- specific colonic delivery can also be used,<br>
. wherein the polymer relies on the bacterial flora of the large bowel to provide enzymatic<br>
degradation of the polymer coat and hence release of the drug. For example, azopolymers<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 4,663,308), glycosides (Friend et al., 1984, J. Med. Chem. 27:261-268) and<br>
a variety of naturally available and modified polysaccharides (PCT GB 89/00581) may be<br>
used in such formulations.<br>
[0039] Pulsed release technology such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 4,777,049<br>
may also be used to administer the active agent to a specific location within the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Such systems permi drug delivery at a predetermined time and can be<br>
used to deliver the active agent, optionally together with other additives that my alter the<br>
local microenvironment to promote agent liability and uptake, directly to the colon, without<br>
relying on external conditions other than the presence of water to provide in vivo release.<br>
[0040] Liquid formulations of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which are<br>
suitable for oral administration may be prepared, packaged, and sold either in liquid form or<br>
in the form of a dry product intended for reconstitution with water or another suitable<br>
vehicle prior to use.<br>
[0041] Liquid suspensions may be prepared using conventional methods to achieve<br>
suspension of the active ingredient in an ac ueous, viscous, or oily vehicle. Aqueous<br>
vehicles include, for example, water and isotonic saline. Oily vehicles include, for example,<br>
almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, vegetable oils such as arachis, olive, sesame, or<br>
coconut oil, fractionated vegetable oils, and mineral oils such as liquid paraffin. Liquid<br>
suspensions may further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not<br>
limited to, suspending agents, dispersing or wetting agents, emulsifying agents, demulcents,<br>
preservatives, buffers, salts, flavorings, coloring agents, and sweetening agents. Oily<br>
suspensions may further comprise a thickening agent Known suspending agents include,<br>
but are not limited to, sorbitol syrup, hydrogenated edible fats, sodium alginate,<br><br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth, gun acacia, and cellulose derivatives such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcelJuIose. Known<br>
dispersing or wetting agents include, but are not limited to, naturally-occurring phosphatides<br>
such as lecithin, condensation products of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, with a long<br>
chain aliphatic alcohol, with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol, or with a<br>
partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g. polyoxyethylene stearate,<br>
heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, polyoxyethylene sorbilol monooleate, and polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate, respectively). Known emulsifying agents include, but are not limited<br>
to, lecithin and acacia. Known preservative s include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl,<br>
or n-propyl-para- hydroxybenzoates, ascortic acid, and sorbic acid. Known sweetening<br>
agents include, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, sucrose, and saccharin-<br>
Known thickening agents for oily suspensions include, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin,<br>
and cetyl alcohol.<br>
[0042] Liquid solutions of the active ingredient in aqueous or oily solvents may be<br>
prepared in substantially the same manner as liquid suspensions, the primary difference<br>
being that the active ingredient is dissolved, rather that suspended in the solvent. Liquid<br>
solutions of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise each of the<br>
components described with regard to liquid suspensions, it being understood that<br>
suspending agents will not necessarily aid dissolution of the active ingredient in the solvent<br>
Aqueous solvents include, for example, water and isotonic saline. Oily solvents include, for<br>
example, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, vegetable oils such as arachis, olive, sesame,<br>
or coconut oil, fractionated vegetable oils, and mineral oils such as liquid paraffin.<br>
[0043] Powdered and granular formulations of a pharmaceutical preparation of the<br>
invention may be prepared using known methods. Such formulations may be administered<br>
directly to a subject, used, for example, to form tablets, to fill capsules, or to prepare an<br>
aqueous or oily suspension or solution by addition of an aqueous or oily vehicle thereto.<br>
Each of these formulations may further comprise one or more of dispersing or wetting<br>
agent, a suspending agent, and a preservative. Additional excipients, such as fillers and<br>
sweetening, flavoring, or coloring agents, may also be included in these formulations.<br>
[0044] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also be prepared, packaged,<br>
or sold in the form of oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. The oily phase may<br>
be a vegetable oil such as olive or arachis oil a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin, or a<br><br><br>
combination of these. Such compositions may further comprise one or more emulsifying<br>
agents such as naturally occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum tragacanth,<br>
naturally-occurring phosphatides such is soybean or lecithin phosphatide, esters or partial<br>
esters derived from combinations of fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides such as sorbitan<br>
monooleate, and condensation products of such partial esters with ethylene oxide such as<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. These emulsions may also contain additional<br>
ingredients including, for example, sweetening or flavoring agents.<br>
[0045] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in a formulation suitable for rectal administraition. Such a composition may be in the<br>
form of, for example, a suppository, a retention enema preparation, and a solution for rectal<br>
or colonic irrigation.<br>
[0046] Suppository formulations may be made by combining the active ingredient with<br>
a non-irritating pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which is solid at ordinary room<br>
temperature (i.e. about 20°C) and which is liquid at the rectal temperature of the subject (i.e.<br>
about 37°C in a healthy human). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include,<br>
but are not limited to, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycols, and various glycerides.<br>
Suppository formulations may further comprise various additional ingredients including, but<br>
not limited to, antioxidants and preservatives.<br>
[0047] Retention enema preparations or solutions for rectal or colonic irrigation may be<br>
made by combining the active ingredient with a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier.<br>
As is well known in the art, enema preparations may be administered using, and may be<br>
packaged within, a delivery device adapted to the rectal anatomy of the subject. Enema<br>
preparations may further comprise various additional ingredients including, but not limited<br>
to, antioxidants and preservatives.<br>
[0048] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in a formulation suitable for vaginal administration. Such a composition may be in the<br>
form of, for example, a suppository, an impregnated or coated vaginally-insertable material<br>
such as a tampon, a douche preparation, 01 a solution for vaginal irrigation.<br>
[0049] Methods for impregnating or coating a material with a chemical composition are<br>
known in the art, and include, but are not limited to methods of depositing or binding a<br>
chemical composition onto a surface, methods of incorporating a chemical composition into<br>
the structure of a material during the synthesis of the material (i.e. such as with a<br><br><br>
physiologically degradable material), and methods of absorbing an aqueous or oily solution<br>
or suspension into an absorbent material, with or without subsequent drying.<br>
[0050] Douche preparations or solutic ns for vaginal irrigation may be made by<br>
combining the active ingredient with a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier. As is<br>
well known in the art, douche preparation; may be administered using, and may be<br>
packaged within, a delivery device adapted to the vaginal anatomy of the subject. Douche<br>
preparations may further comprise various additional ingredients including, but not limited<br>
to, antioxidants, antibiotics, antifungal agents, and preservatives.<br>
[0051] As used herein, "parenteral administration" of a pharmaceutical composition<br>
includes any route of administration characterized by physical breaching of a tissue of a<br>
subject and administration of the pharmaceutical composition through the breach in the<br>
tissue. Parenteral administration thus includes, but is not limited to, administration of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition by injection of the composition, by application of the<br>
composition through a surgical incision, by application of the composition through a tissue-<br>
penetrating non-surgical wound, and the like. In particular, parenteral administration is<br>
contemplated to include, but is not limited to, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous,<br>
intraarterial, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection and intravenous, intraarterial, or kidney<br>
dialytic infusion techniques.<br>
[0052] Formulations of a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral<br>
administration comprise the active ingredient combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, such as sterile water or sterile isotonic saline. Such formulations may be prepared,<br>
packaged, or sold in a form suitable for bolus administration or for continuous<br>
administration. Injectable formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold in unit dosage<br>
form, such as in ampules, in multi-dose containers containing a preservative, or in single-<br>
use devices for auto-injection or injection b) a medical practitioner. Formulations for<br>
parenteral administration include, but are no limited to, suspensions, solutions, emulsions in<br>
oily or aqueous vehicles, pastes, and implantable sustained-release or biodegradable<br>
formulations. Such formulations may furthe - comprise one or more, additional ingredients<br>
including, but not limited to, suspending, stabilizing, or dispersing agents. In one<br>
embodiment of a formulation for parenteral administration, the active ingredient is provided<br>
in dry (i.e. powder or granular) form for reconstitution. with a suitable vehicle (e.g. sterile<br>
pyrogen-free water) prior to parenteral administration of the reconstituted composition.<br><br><br>
[0053] The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, or sold in the<br>
form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension or solution. This suspension or<br>
solution may be formulated according to the known art, and may comprise, in addition to<br>
the active ingredient, additional ingredients such as the dispersing agents, wetting agents, or<br>
suspending agents described herein. Such sterile injectable formulations may be prepared<br>
using a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as water or 1,3-butane<br>
diol, for example. Other acceptable diluents and solvents include, but are not limited to,<br>
Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloric e solution, and fixed oils such as synthetic mono-<br>
or di-glycerides. Other parentally-administrable formulations which are useful include<br>
those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form, in a liposomal<br>
preparation, or as a component of a biodegradable polymer systems. Compositions for<br>
sustained release or implantation may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials such as an emulsion, an ion exchange resin, a sparingly soluble<br>
polymer, or a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
[0054] Formulations suitable for topical administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
liquid or semi-liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, oil-in-water or water-in-oil<br>
emulsions such as creams, ointments or pastes, and sprayable solutions or suspensions.<br>
Topically-administrable formulations may, for example, comprise from about 1% to about<br>
10% (w/w) active ingredient, although the concentration of the active ingredient may be as<br>
high as the solubility limit of the active in gredient in the solvent. Formulations for topical<br>
administration may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described<br>
herein.<br>
[0055] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Such a<br>
formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient and which<br>
have a diameter in the range from about 0.5 to about 7 nanometers, and preferably from<br>
about 1 to about 6 nanometers. Such com positions are conveniently in the form of dry<br>
powders for administration using a device comprising a dry powder reservoir to which a<br>
stream of propellant may be directed to disperse the powder or using a self-propelling<br>
solvent/powder-dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient<br>
dissolved or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a sealed container. Preferably, such<br>
powders comprise particles wherein at least 98% of the particles by weight have a diameter<br><br><br>
greater than 0.5 nanometers and at least 95% of the particles by number have a diameter less<br>
than 7 nanometers. More preferably, at least 95% of the particles by weight have a diameter<br>
greater than 1 nanometer and at least 90% of the particles by number have a diameter less<br>
than 6 nanometers. Dry powder composit ons preferably include a solid fine powder diluent<br>
such as sugar and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form.<br>
[0056] Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling<br>
point of below 65°F at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50 to<br>
99.9% (w/w) of the composition, and the active ingredient may constitute 0.1 to 10% (w/w)<br>
of the composition. The propellant may fu rther comprise additional ingredients such as a<br>
liquid non-ionic or solid anionic surfactant or a solid diluent (preferably having a particle<br>
size of the same order as particles comprising the active ingredient).<br>
[0057] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention formulated for pulmonary delivery<br>
may also provide the active ingredient in the form of droplets (e.g., an inhalable mist) of a<br>
solution or suspension. Such formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold as aqueous<br>
or dilute alcoholic solutions or suspensions, optionally sterile, comprising the active<br>
ingredient, and may conveniently be administered using any nebulization or atomization<br>
device. Such formulations may further comprise one or more additional ingredients<br>
including, but not limited to, a flavoring agent such as saccharin sodium, a volatile oil, a<br>
buffering agent, a surface active agent, or a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate.<br>
The droplets provided by this route of administration preferably have an average diameter in<br>
the range from about 0.1 to about 200 nanometers.<br>
[0058] The formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery are<br>
also useful for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
[0059] Another formulation suitable for i ntranasal administration is a coarse powder<br>
comprising the active ingredient and having an average particle from about 0.2 to 500<br>
micrometers. Such a formulation is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken i.e.<br>
by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to<br>
the nares.<br>
[0060] Formulations suitable for nasal administratiio n may, for example, comprise from<br>
about as little as 0.1% (w/w) and as much as 100% (w/w) of the active ingredient, and may<br>
further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.<br><br><br>
[0061] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in a formulation suitable for buccal administration. Such formulations may, for<br>
example, be in the form of tablets or lozenges made using conventional methods, and may,<br>
for example; 0.1 to 10% (w/w) active ingredient, the balance comprising an orally<br>
dissolvable or degradable composition and. optionally, one or more of the additional<br>
ingredients described herein. Alternately, formulations suitable for buccal administration<br>
may comprise a powder or an aerosolized c r atomized solution or suspension comprising the<br>
active ingredient. Such powdered, aerosolized, or aerosolized formulations, when<br>
dispersed, preferably have an average particle or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 to<br>
about 200 nanometers, and may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients<br>
described herein.<br>
[0062] A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or<br>
sold in a formulation suitable for ophthalmic administration. Such formulations may, for<br>
example, be in the form of eye drops includi ng, for example, a 0.1-1.0% (w/w) solution or<br>
suspension of the active ingredient in an aqteous or oily liquid carrier. Such drops may<br>
further comprise buffering agents, salts, or one or more other of the additional ingredients<br>
described herein. Other ophthalmalmically- administrable formulations which are useful<br>
include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form or in a<br>
liposomal preparation.<br>
[0063] As used herein, "additional ingredients" include, but are not limited to, one or<br>
more of the following: excipients; surface active agents; dispersing agents; inert diluents;<br>
granulating and disintegrating agents; binding agents; lubricating agents; sweetening agents;<br>
flavoring agents; coloring agents; preservatives; physiologically degradable compositions<br>
such as gelatin; aqueous vehicles and solvents; oily vehicles and solvents; suspending<br>
agents; dispersing or wetting agents; emulsifying agents, demulcents; buffers; salts;<br>
thickening agents; fillers; emulsifying agents antioxidants; antibiotics; antifungal agents;<br>
stabilizing agents; and pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials.<br>
Other "additional ingredients" which may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the invention are known in the art and described, for example in Genaro, ed., 1985,<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing; Co., Easton, PA, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>
[006] Jt is understood that the ordinarily skilled physician or oncologist will readily<br>
determine and prescribe an effective amount of the compound to inhibit tumor growth,<br>
induce tumor shrinkage, or inhibit or prevent tumorigenesis in the subject. In so proceeding,<br>
the physician or oncologist may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first,<br>
subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. It is further<br>
understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular subject will depend upon<br>
a variety of factors including the activity c f the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route<br>
of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the stage or severity of<br>
any existing tumor.<br>
[0065] Another aspect of the invention relates to a kit comprising a pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the invention and an instructional material. As used herein, an "instructional<br>
material" includes a publication, a recording, a diagram, or any other medium of expression<br>
which is used to communicate the usefulness of the pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
less than 10%, by weight, of a toluene sulfonamide for inhibiting tumor growth, inducing<br>
tumor shrinkage, or inhibiting or preventing; tumorigenesis in a human subject. The<br>
instructional material may also, for example, describe an appropriate dose of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The instructional material of the kit of the<br>
invention may, for example, be affixed to a container which contains a pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the invention or be shipped together with a container which contains the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the instructional material may be shipped<br>
separately from the container with the intention that the instructional material and the<br>
pharmaceutical composition be used cooperatively by the recipient<br>
[0066] The invention also includes a kit comprising a pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
invention and a delivery device for delivering the composition to a subject. By way of<br>
example, the delivery device may be a squeezable spray bottle, a metered-dose spray bottle,<br>
an aerosol spray device, an atomizer, a dry powder delivery device, a self-propelling<br>
solvent/powder-dispensing device, a syringe, a needle, a tampon, or a dosage measuring<br>
container. The kit may further comprise an instructional material as described herein.<br>
[0067] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical com position has the composition set<br>
forth in Table I.<br>
-16-<br><br><br>
[0068] In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be an<br>
ingestible food or beverage product composing a relatively low amount (e.g., 9.9%, 6%,<br>
3%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.1% or less, by weight of the product) of a toluene sulfonamide. Such<br>
compositions are useful for preventing tumor formation in humans at risk for tumorigenesis.<br>
These products can be used both by humans who have never been afflicted with a tumor and<br>
by humans who have previously been afflicted with a tumor (i.e., in order to prevent<br>
recurrence of the same tumor or formation of another tumor). In one embodiment, the<br>
product is a normal foodstuff (e.g., a tea or a biscuit) that has been supplemented with a<br>
toluene sulfonamide. In another embodiment, the product is a liquid, solid, or semi-solid<br>
that is not a normal foodstuff, but has beer formulated for use as a tumor preventive agent.<br>
Semi-solid or liquid formulations are preferred for humans who have difficulty swallowing<br>
or retaining solid foods.<br>
[0069] Anti-Tumor Methods<br>
[0070] The invention includes method; of inhibiting tumor growth, shrinking tumors,<br>
and preventing tumor formation (i.e., tumorigenesis) in a human. Each of these methods<br>
involves administering a toluene sulfonamide-containing pharmaceutical composition<br>
described herein to a human who is either already afflicted with a tumor or at risk for<br>
developing a tumor. The method of administering the composition is not critical. For<br>
example, the compositions can be administered orally, rectally, topically, parenterally, by<br>
infusion, or by a pulmonary route. For certain types of tumors, particular routes of<br>
administration can be preferred. For example, in humans afflicted with a tumor in a tissue<br>
lining a body cavity (e.g., lung, esophageal, and gastric tumors of epithelial origin),<br><br><br>
administration of a viscous or adhesive composition 1o the body cavity, and preferably to the<br>
lining of the cavity, is preferred. The visccus composition is more viscous than water at<br>
body temperature, and is preferably more viscous than body fluids that are normally present<br>
at the tissue lining the cavity. The adhesive composition comprises an agent which is not<br>
easily rinsed from the tissue lining the cavity by normal body fluids. The net effect of<br>
administering the viscous or adhesive composition is mat the toluene sulfonamide is<br>
localized at or near the site of a tumor or of potential lumorigenesis. In another<br>
embodiment, a injectable form of a pharmaceutical composition described herein is injected<br>
at or near a tumor site or at or near a body location where tumorigenesis is suspected.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0071] The anti-tumor activities of the pharmaceutical compositions have been<br>
demonstrated in in vivo experiments and in limited clinical studies. The results obtained<br>
from those experiments and trials demonstrate mat pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
less than 10%, by weight, of a toluene sulfonamide exhibit remarkable anti-tumor activities.<br>
These experiments and studies are described with reference to the following Examples.<br>
These Examples are provided for the purpos; of illustration only and the invention is not<br>
limited to these examples, but rather encompasses all variations which are evident as a result<br>
of the teaching provided herein.<br>
[0072] Example 1<br>
[0073] Preparation of a Pharmaceutical Composition Comprising Toluene Sulfonamide<br>
[0074] All the chemical ingredients employed to form the composition described in this<br>
Example are commercially available. The preparation of the pharmaceutical composition<br>
essentially comprised making the composition described in Example I of U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,891,454 and then diluting that composition five-fold with honey. The diluted composition<br>
was thoroughly mixed, bottled, and sterilized.<br>
[0075] Example 2<br>
[0076] In Vivo Anti-Tumor Activity of Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising Para-<br>
Toluene Sulfonamide<br>
[0077] In this Example, experiments are described in which documented the ability of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions to inhibit growth of tumor cells in vivo. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprised para-toluene sulfonamide in various concentrations.<br><br><br>
[0078] Mice harboring transplanted tumor cells were used as an in vivo model of tumor<br>
growth. Hepatocarcinoma cells were implanted into a first group of selected mice.<br>
Sarcoma S-180 cells were implanted into a second group of selected mice. The average<br>
weight of the mice used was 20 grams<br>
[0079] A pharmaceutical composition was prepared as described in Example I and<br>
diluted in a solution comprising physiological saline and 5% (v/v) TWEEN20™ to form<br>
individual pharmaceutical compositions which comprised para-toluene sulfonamide (PTS)<br>
at concentrations of 10.8%, 5.8%, and 4.1%, by weight. Individual mice received 0.2<br>
milliliters of one of these pharmaceutical compositions each day for ten consecutive days by<br>
gavage. As a control ("Control 1" in the tables below), selected mice received the<br>
salino/TWEEN20TM solution that did not contain any PTS for 10 consecutive days by<br>
gavage. As a further control ("Control 2" in the tables below), selected mice were not<br>
administered PTS or the saline/TWEEN20 solution by gavage. The 10-day treatment<br>
regimen was then repeated, for a total of 20 days of treatment<br>
[0080] Twenty days following the beginning of administration of the selected<br>
composition, the mice were humanely sacrificed, and the weight of the tumor mass was<br>
determined and compared with the weight of the tumor cells that were initially implanted.<br>
Inhibition of tumor growth was assessed by comparing tumor growth in mice to Control 2<br>
mice. The results obtained in these experiments are shown in Table 2 (corresponding to<br>
experiments using transplanted hepatocarcinoma cells) and Table 3 (corresponding to<br>
experiments using transplanted sarcoma S-180 cells). P values were calculated using<br>
standard statistical methods. .<br><br><br><br>
[0081] The results of these experiments demonstrate that pharmaceutical composition<br>
that comprise less than 10%, by weight, of a toluene sulfonamide exhibit tumor growth-<br>
inhibiting activity, and can be expected to exhibit the other tumor-shrinking and tumor-<br>
preventing activities.<br>
[0082] Example 3<br>
[0083] Limited Human Clinical Trials of a Pharmaceutical Composition Comprising 6%<br>
Para-Toluene Sulfonamide<br>
[0084] The human clinical data presente 1 in this Example demonstrates that oral<br>
administration of pharmaceutical composition comprising 6%, by weight, para-toluene<br>
sulfonamide (PTS) effectively inhibits esophageal cancer-in humans.<br>
[0085] The pharmaceutical composition was made as described in Example I, except<br>
that the concentration of PTS in the composi ion was 30% prior to dilution, and therefore<br>
6.0% (i.e., after five-fold dilution with honey) in the syrup administered to the patients.<br>
Patients were advised to swallow the syrup slowly, and not to drink any other liquid for half<br>
an hour. Owing to the bitterness of the syrup, the composition was provided in a 10 or 20<br>
milliliter syringe (without needle), which allowed delivery of the composition to the<br>
patient's throat, and minimization of contact of the syrup with the patient's tongue. The<br>
composition was administered twice per day, for a period of at least two or three weeks, and<br>
daily administration continued for years in some instances.<br>
[0086] The treatment has been tested in treating more than a dozen patients afflicted<br>
with late stage esophageal cancer, and therapeutic effecd has been demonstrated in about<br>
75% of the patients treated. Esophageal cancer patients frequently have difficulty<br>
swallowing. For many patients treated with the composition, swallowing difficulties were<br><br><br>
relieved within two or three weeks following the onset of treatment. The treatment can be<br>
administered after or during chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both, and enhances the<br>
therapeutic effectiveness of those interventions. The toluene sulfonamide treatment also<br>
prolongs the utility of the trans-esophageal self-expanding metallic stent that has been<br>
described by others. As examples of the therapeutic effectiveness that can be achieved by<br>
administration of a composition comprising less than 10%, by weight, toluene sulfonamide,<br>
the following two case studies are provided.<br>
[0087] Case Study 1<br>
[0088] Patient 1 was a 62-year-old female afflicted with late stage esophageal cancer,<br>
who had complained of dysphagia for about one year prior to treatment. Around the time<br>
PTS administration was begun, Patient 1 experienced difficulty swallowing, was on semi-<br>
liquid diet, and had been diagnosed with scuamous cell carcinoma of upper cervical<br>
esophagus. Radiographic imaging of the patient during ingestion of a barium-containing<br>
meal demonstrated that the patient's esophageal lumen was narrow and irregular along about<br>
9 centimeters of its length (See Figure 1).<br>
[0089] Patient 1 was first treated by direct extension radiation, whereby a total of about<br>
6 000 rads was administered to the tumor site. Severe local irritation occurred, and Patient 1<br>
declined further treatment. As an alternative, the patient was administered the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, prepared as described in Example 1 and comprising PTS at a<br>
concentration of 6.0% by weight of the composition. The patient was administered 10<br>
milliliters of this composition twice a day (i.e., a daily dose of roughly 1 gram of PTS).<br>
After 2 weeks, local symptoms subsided, and the patient was able to swallow some soft<br>
food. About one and a half years of this treatment, the dose was reduced to 5 milliliters<br>
twice per day (i.e., about 500 milligrams of PTS per day). At this time, the patient could<br>
swallow semi-soft diets, reported feeling quite healthy, and started to resume normal house-<br>
hold work. About two years thereafter, the patient was able to swallow normally, and the<br>
patient's esophagus appeared smooth and normal by radiographic imaging during ingestion<br>
of a barium-containing meal (See Figure 2). At that time, administration of oral liquid<br>
composition was discontinued in favor of administration of a soft gel form of the PTS-<br>
containing composition (at a dose of about 500 milligrams of PTS per day). About a year<br>
later, the therapy was considered no longer necessary and discontinued. So far, the patient<br>
has survived more than five years, and recuirence of the tumor has not been detected.<br><br><br>
[0090] The efficacy of this therapeutic regimen is particularly surprising, in view of the<br>
poor outlook of late stage esophageal cancer patients. For late staging esophageal cancer<br>
patients treated with conventional cherno and radio-therapies, the 5-year survival rate is<br>
only about 20% (using information provided by the American Cancer Society). Patient 1<br>
did not respond well to traditional radiotherapy, but appears to have manifested a near<br>
complete remission, without recurrence, following administration of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition described herein.<br>
[0091] Case Study 2<br>
[0092] Patient 2 was a 72-year-old male who complained of dysphagia for more than 2<br>
years and was able to consume a liquid diet only with difficulty. The patient was diagnosed<br>
as being afflicted with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus, the tumor being located in the<br>
middle portion of the esophagus, the afflicted portion of the esophagus being about 10<br>
centimeters in length (See Figure 3).<br>
[0093] Because of the patient's debility, a surgical operation was not performed.<br>
Because the patient could not swallow at all, a trans-esophageal self-expanding metallic<br>
stent was installed under X-ray guidance in order to create a path for swallowing.<br>
Emplacement of the stent permitted the pat ent to swallow soft foods (See Figure 4).<br>
[0094] Administration of a PTS-containing pharmaceutical composition prepared as<br>
described in Example I (containing 6.0% PTS, by weight) 3 times per day in aliquots of 6<br>
milliliters (i.e., a total daily dose of about 1 2 grams) was begun immediately upon<br>
emplacement of the stent, and has continued for more than fourteen months. During that<br>
time, the patient has lived comfortably at home, and has exhibited continuing improvement<br>
(See Figure 5). The patient's bone marrow, liver, and renal functions appear not to have<br>
been adversely affected by the treatment.<br>
[0095] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to<br>
the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept<br>
thereof. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular<br>
embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope<br>
