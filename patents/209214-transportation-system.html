g4CyCfi)R;0TJNi) APT<br>
Public transport systems are promotc^d in most mfjjor cities to reduce road congestion and ihe poUutic&gt;u problems causeclby high levels of road vehiok ti.se.<br>
ID Som^i instance ro?/d buses axo promoted s£ m alterriative to the public using their own cars for txajtisport within a city. However, buses are relatively largi^ vc^hicles and not very cost efflcient if there ate only a small nucaber of passengers who are prepaiai to use the bus service. Buses are jdsb slow compared to private cavs and are vulnerable to delays caused by toad congestion problems* Buses will still contribute to the air and roise pollution j)roblems faa?d by most cities.<br>
One otlier type of public or passenger transportation pystem pioposed for intra-city travel is traiw: md rail networks. However, knovm types of i^ net\v'orks also have a wmber of disadvantages associated with their use,<br>
A nail network must use large are^i!^ of land in central locations m well as expensive locomotives md cturiages Ui transport passengers. These two factoii&gt; combined make the confttrucUon, tniji^lementation and raaintenanc?e of a r^ net^'ork an oxp^^nsive proposition. Purthcnnore, large scale rail notworlcs are also limited in the areas of a city In wliich they can transport passengcf^.

The present invention may be adapted to provide a traiisportation system. Preferably a traasportation system implemented in accordance with the present invention may be used to ttansport passengr.rs or to provide a public passenger trausjxjrtation system, The present ttivoivion may provide sigiiifjcaat advantages in tiiis i^)plication over the prior art due to its ^Uity to satisty passengers* needs for a thnely aiid oonvenieut transpoitation service^<br>
ilefen;nce throughout ttiis speclflcatioa will also be made to the present- inveution being used te provide a passenger transportation system bur those skilled in the art should appreciate that other aj^piications are also envisioned, l^orexamplc, it is Also possible for the present invention to be ujsed 1:0 tnm(s;poTt goodf; if required and reference to the transportation of passenger^i only Uiroughout this specification should in no way be i&gt;een as Jindting,<br>
la a preferred embodiment the presect bvention indudes a plurality of upright supporti, The^e suppoit» may be used to elevate otlie-r components; of the traiis]X)rtation system and also to suppoit these components and place them out of the "v^^ay of any obstacles that might be euqouiUered at lower elevations* Using upright supports to elevate otiier componenta of the systeiEi also reduces the system's 'kotpnnH" or the a^nount of land actually taken up through iulpletaotttatlon of the present inventiou*<br>
Prefembly the upright supports employed are arranged in a lougitudinal array along the length of<br>
the tta^^k to be supported.<br>
■ ! jpii^fonibly a sbgle upright support only is used to support one point of the traek.<br><br>

Tha present invention may be adapted lo transport a pluraUiy of cabs aad h(Hicc passengers or goods residing within the cabs.<br>
In a preferred wnbodbnent a cab may form a Mly enclosed cabin. Such n cab may also iiiQlude seating for a small numl^e^ of people. This in turn allowiS the. size of the cabs us«&gt;d to bo reduced, thereby limiting the capital costs required to impl,cment the present invention and also the aesthetic or visual impajca tlifr system will have on its suxj'oundings.<br>
In a f\u-tl]cr preferred embodiment s cab may be confij^iued to contain seating, for ten or less peoplci, and preferably nriay contain seating for ei^^^t passengers only. By reducing the ttumber of passengers that can ba liansported by a cab this makes it easier for the cab to be filled at »ny time. Furthermore, the provision of small cabs also allows the fxequency at wbich cabs ti-avel a partlctUar section of the transportation system to he vaiied easily. In times of peek passeitger trafilc large numbers of cabs may bo shuttled tfarougli a particulai art»a, whereas in off-pealf. times the number of cabs passing through may be reduced.<br>

By providing tNVo rail elements on either side of the sajiae track tliis will substantially increase the fle:dbUJLty of the tranispottation ey-Sitam with legurd. to the routes that cabs can take along tiic system, and will also substantially hicrease numbers of cabs and volumes of passengers which die aystem can transj^ort at any one time,<br>
In a pn^ferred embodiificnt a track may be formed from a ceulTal body poxtion with two pairs of side arms projectiiiE from the body portion to fonn th'^ first and second rdil elements. This design of track provides this component with a linuted or compact width, thereby reducing the envixomaental and aesthetic impact of the system on its surrounding environiiient. Ti^ palts of projecting side arms extending from ihe central bended<br><br>
&amp; fiorttier preferred embodiment onC side of a cab only may be linked to a track to locate the ib's centre of mass below the track. This offset connection scheme for a c4b again assures, that e cab is suspended ftom a track m6 limits th^^ v/idtji or extent of the system and hence its apa;jt on the flurrouBding esnvironment<br>
reibrably a track may f:&gt;e linked to a tab thjough a. diiv&amp; system employcjd to pull or push,the ab along the tracks. In such embodiments a strvctuiBl beam or membftt may be mounted on one tde Or edge of a cab with drive system componenli; connft^^ted to Uiis beam, which are in turn onnecited to the track to si^spend the cab from the tnick.<br>
D a pxefftrred embodiment cabs supported by a (rack, are euspeuded from the track when mi use. iuspeiiding cabs from m elevated track wiU still elevate each cab abovo the ground but will esitrict the total height of the transportatiou system md the total volume of space (hat it &gt;coupi<?s. TTiese  con^iiderations  are nnpo;itant  wlic^n evaluatiag the &#9632; visu'al  impact the ranspt:'3tation tjystem wJJl have on its surroundings, A.s the height wMoh the cabs aic elevated is :irefetably limited, mii;; in turn limits tbe size ol shadov/s c£u^t onto tl\e surroimding envii'onment >y eabs.   Furthermore, by where possible reducing tlae volume of" space occupied by tjie xansportation system this agab limits the visual inip^ict the system will have on its suixoundings when hisfcalled These coiisiderations are important when the trtmsportation ^ystem is to be mn Lhrougb or installe^i withb an wdsting suburban envlronmeuv where householdere may feel sensitive to their living space being dominated or overshadowed by the elevated track and cabs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention may include a contiol systetri for a cab, where such a csontrol Byetem may be adapted to control the routo or path which the cab take?; along the ttanspoitation system. Such a control system may be unijommunication withother components of the transportation system such as switching systems or elements which are used to move a cab from one track onto an adjacent track to change the pa^ih or the route to be take^i by the cabr     I<br><br>

from Figure 4a the track 2 is formed from or includes on each of its opposite faces a first rail element 7 and a second rail element 8. The first rail elemedt 7 is shown supporting a cab 3 which is adapted to move in a direction orientated substantially out of the page. Conversely the second track element is adapted to support and guide the motion of a cab or cabs moving in the direction orientated substantially into the page.<br>
Also shown with respect to Figures 4a and 4b is a pair of drive carriages 9 forming a drive system used to pull the cab 3 along the track 2. Each cab is suspended and driven by two drive carriages 9.<br>
Figure 5 shows an enlarged cross section side view of a drive carriage 9 as used in the embodiment illustrated by Figures 4a and 4b. The drive carriage 9 is adapted to engage with and connect to a rail element 8 to support and guide and drive the motion of the cab along the track 2 (not fully shown). The drive carriage 9 includes a framework 10 on which a number of vertical guide wheels 11 are located. The vertical guide wheels 11 engage with vertical flanges formed in the body of each rail element to lock the drive element 9 onto the rail element. This framework also supjjorts and locates a pair of drive wheels 12 and a pair of vertical pressure wheels 13. The end view of Figure 5 shows only the first of the pairs of drive and vertical pressure wheels. The drive wheel 12 is associated with and driven by an electric motor 14 which rotates the drive wheel 12 and hence pulls the drive element 9 and associated cab along the rail element 8. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art the pressure wheel 13 may also be driven by the electric motor 14 if required.<br>
Also shown with respect to Figure 5 is a mounting beam 10b which depends from framework 10 incorporated into the drive element. This mounting beam extends past the drive element to other drive elements incorporated into the system and is used to directly connect or Unk a cab to the drive system and associated drive elements.<br>
Figures 6a, 6b and 6c show the motion of a single drive carriages 9 on the top of a cab as the cab is switched onto an adjacent track. In the instance shown with respect to Figure 6a the cab (not shown) is initially travelling along a first track 2a and is to be switched onto an arfiarftnt trarV Oh<br><br>
To implement the switch of a cab a portion of the track 2a is adapted to pivot outwards towards the second track 2b. This pivoting section of the track 2a is shown as the dotted section 2c. In effect only a portion of the track 2a is used to form the section 2c by pivoting out the section of the rail element of the track on which the cab is travelling. As shown in Figures 6a, 6b and 6c this rail element when pivoted outward guides each drive carriage 9 and the associated cab outwards away from the original track 2a onto the new track 2b. Once the cab has been fully transferred onto the new track 2b, the section of rail element 2c may be pivoted back into line with the main body of the track 2a.<br>
Figures 7a,7b show side and top schematic views of elements used to form a switching system as described with respect to Figures 6a, 6b and 6c. The switching system 15 incorporates a pair of panels 16 connected together via a hinge element 17 along their adjacent edges. Connected to the hinge 17 is a drive rod 18a that can apply a pushing or pulling force to the hinge 17. In the situation shown with respect to Figures 7a and 7b the drive rod 18a is used to push the panel 16 so that they will lie substantially in the same plane. This will in tum pivot outwards the rail element 8 from main body of a track 2. Conversely when the rail element 8 is to be pivoted back in close proximity to the main body of the track 2, the drive rod 18a may be used to push or pull the panels so that they will lie substantially parallel to one another within a relatively small volume. This will in tum pull the rail element 8 back into contact with the main body of the track 2. '<br>
In some embodiments a switching system may also include a drive arm 18b forming a pushing or pulling element (such as a pneumatic or hydraulic ram) which is attached to one end'of the rail element 8. The opposite end of such an arm 18b engages with the main body of the track or other associated components to start the rail element 8 moving outwards to switch a cab or back inwards after a cab has been switched.<br>
Figure 8 shows the action of a biasing means introduced into the drive system for a cab. Such a biasing means can pivot or tiU the cab as shown by the ghosted cab outline in Figure 8 to smooth out momentum changes during cab switching.<br><br>
A biasing means, implemented in the embodiment shown by a hydraulic ram 20 is introduced<br>
between a drive system carriage and a connecting lever pivotably connected to the carriage and<br>
directly connected to a top mounting bar on the roof of the cab. The hydraulic ram is sited on<br>
the drive carriage and pushes against this pivoting lever to move the cab as shown with respect<br>
to Figure 8 before the cab reaches a switching system. Prior movement of the cab before it is<br>
switched smoothes momentum changes in the cab and therefore provides a smoother ride for the<br>
cab's passengers.	'	,<br>
