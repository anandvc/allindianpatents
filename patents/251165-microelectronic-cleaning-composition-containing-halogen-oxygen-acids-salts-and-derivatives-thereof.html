MICROELECTRONIC CLEANING COMPOSITION CONTAINING HALOGEN OXYGEN ACIDS, SALTS AND DERIVATIVES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to methods and cleaning compositions for cleaning microelectronic substrates, and particularly to such cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by silicon dioxide, sensitive IOW-K or high-K dielectrics and copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallization, as well as substrates of Al or AI(Cu) metallizations and advanced interconnect technologies. The invention also relates to the use of such cleaning compositions for stripping photoresists, and cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, and cleaning residues from planarization processes such as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP).<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Many photoresist strippers and residue removers have been proposed for use in the microelectronics field as downstream or back end of the manufacturing line cleaners. In the manufacturing process a thin film of photoresist is deposited on a wafer substrate, and then circuit design is imaged on the thin film. Following baking, the unpolymerized resist is removed with a photoresist developer. The resulting image is then transferred to the underlying material, which is generally a dielectric or metal, by way of reactive plasma etch gases or chemical etchant solutions. The etchant gases or chemical etchant solutions selectively attack the photoresist-unprotected area of the substrate. As a result of the plasma etching process, photoresist, etching gas and etched material by-products are deposited as residues around or on the sidewall of the etched openings on the substrate.<br><br>
[0003] Additionally, following the termination of the etching step, the resist mask must be removed from the protected area of the wafer so that the final finishing operation can take place. This can be accomplished in a plasma ashing step by the use of suitable plasma ashing gases or wet chemical strippers. Finding a suitable cleaning composition for removal of this resist mask material without adversely affecting, e.g., corroding, dissolving or dulling, the metal circuitry has also proven problematic.<br>
[0004] As microelectronic fabrication integration levels have increased and patterned microelectronic device dimensions have decreased, it has become increasingly common in the art to employ copper metallizations, IOW-K and high-K dielectrics. These materials have presented additional challenges to find acceptable cleaner compositions. Many process technology compositions that have been previously developed for "traditional" or "conventional" semiconductor devices containing AI/SiO2 or AI(Cu)/SiO2 structures cannot be employed with copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallized, and IOW-K or high-K dielectric structures. For example, hydroxylamine based stripper or residue remover compositions are successfully used for cleaning devices with Al metallizations, but are practically unsuitable for those with copper and other metallizations. Similarly, many copper metallized/ IOW-K strippers are not suitable for Al metallized devices unless significant adjustments in the compositions are made.<br>
[0005] Removal of these etch and/or ash residues following the plasma etch and/or ashing process has proved problematic. Failure to completely remove or neutralize these residues can result in the absorption of moisture and the formation of undesirable materials that can cause corrosion to the metal structures. The circuitry  materials  are  corroded  by the   undesirable  materials  and   produce<br><br>
discontinuances in the circuitry wiring and undesirable increases in electrical resistance.<br>
[0006] The current back end cleaners show a wide range of compatibility with certain, sensitive dielectrics and metallizations, ranging from totally unacceptable to . marginally satisfactory. Many of the current strippers or residue cleaners are not acceptable for advanced interconnect materials such as porous and IOW-K dielectrics and copper metallizations. Additionally, the typical alkaline cleaning solutions employed are overly aggressive towards porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and/or copper metallizations. Moreover, many of these alkaline cleaning compositions contain organic solvents that show poor product stability, especially at higher pH ranges and at higher process temperatures.<br>
[0007] Heretofore, oxidizers have been used in cleaning compositions in primarily aqueous form. Oxidizers, such as the commonly used hydrogen peroxide and peracids, are known to react readily or decompose easily, especially in organic solvent matrices that have been generally employed in stripping compositions. In such instances the oxidizing agent is consumed and becomes unavailable for its intended use. Additionally, microelectronic cleaning compositions containing oxidizers often show poor product stability, especially in the presence of significant amounts of 10 wt% or more of organic solvents, and at higher pH ranges and high process temperatures. Furthermore, in many compositions the use of stabilizers and solvents often tie up the oxidizing agent resulting in diminished capabilities of performing effective oxidation/reduction reactions employed in the cleaning process. In US Patent No. 6,116,254 the inventors teach introducing chlorine gas into pure water in a tank to thereby generate chloride ions, hypochlorite ions, chlorite ions and chlorate ions in the pure water and, then immersing a substrate in the pure water solution for cleaning. Such a cleaning scheme is not well controlled or stable over a period of days and is certainly not environmentally friendly and has toxic properties.   Additionally, the amount of dissolved chlorine is limited to no<br><br>
more than 0.3% due to the limitation of the amount of chlorine gas dissolvable in the water. Furthermore, the pure water solutions with dissolved chlorine gas is always an acidic mixture and, thus, not usable in situations where an alkaline cleaning solution is desired or required. Moreover, such a cleaning solution is not a preformed product capable of being packaged and transported for use at a site remote from its production. Also, the patentees state that it is sometimes necessary to scr^n the irradiation of visible and/or UV light to the pure water solution containing the dissolved chlorine gas in order to prevent decomposition from occurring. The pure water solution containing the dissolved chlorine gas is also temperature sensitive and is generally kept at a temperature of 10°C while being generated and until ready for use. All of the drawbacks make this cleaning system not very desirable and severely limits its use.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] There is, therefore, a need for microelectronic cleaning compositions that are suitable for back end cleaning operations, which compositions are effective cleaners and are applicable for stripping photoresists and cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, cleaning residues from penalization processes, such as CMP, and which can be used for advanced interconnect materials employing copper and other metallizations, including but not limited to tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, and tin metallization, and porous or non-porous IOW-K (i.e., a K value of 3 or less) or high-K (i.e., a K value of 20 or greater) dielectrics as well as useful for cleaning conventional devices, such as those with aluminum or aluminum(copper) metallizations containing silicon dioxide, IOW-K or high-K dielectrics. There is also a need for such cleaning compositions that avoid pitfalls and drawbacks of the cleaning system disclosed in US Patent No. 6,116,254 as mentioned hereinbefore. This invention also relates to such compositions that are generally effective cleaners for cleaning all such devices over a wide range of pH<br><br>
conditions.<br>
[0009] It has been discovered that effective microelectronic cleaning compositions for cleaning microelectronic substrates, and particularly cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by silicon dioxide, sensitive IOW-K or high-K dielectrics and copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallization, as well as substrates of Al or AI(Cu) metallizations and advanced interconnect technologies, are provided by microelectronic cleaning compositions comprising an oxidizer selected from halogen oxygen acids, salts of said acids, and derivatives thereof wherein the derivatives are selected from halogenated isocyanates, chlorine dioxide, chlorine monoxide, and hypochlorite-phosphite complexes, with the proviso that when the oxidizer is hypochlorous acid the cleaning composition also must contain a non-ammonium-producing alkaline base. These cleaning compositions provide improved and superior cleaning and residue removal with surprisingly good compatibilities with many sensitive substrates. Such microelectronic cleaning compositions that comprise metal-free halogen oxygen acids and salts thereof have shown particular advantageous capabilities for microelectronic cleaning applications.<br>
[0010] The microelectronic cleaning compositions of this invention can be formulated as highly aqueous to semi-aqueous to non-aqueous (organic), i.e., non-reactive organic solvent which is inclusive of minimally non-reactive organic solvent based, compositions, with the proviso that when the organic salt of the halogen oxygen acid is an alkyl hypochiorite, the solvent is not an amide, sulfone, sulfolene, seienone or a saturated alcohol solvent. The cleaning compositions of this invention are suitable for stripping photoresists and cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, and have improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by silicon<br><br>
dioxide, sensitive IOW-K or high-K dielectrics and copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, indium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallization, as well as substrates of Al or AI(Cu) metallizations, and advanced interconnect technologies. Additionally, the cleaning compositions of this invention are particularly suitable for cleaning difficult samples containing very stubborn plasma etch and ash residues and also hardened (e.g., polymerized) photoresists that are generated in the manufacturing process for producing CU/IOW-K and high-K dielectrics structures, whereas other highly aggressive reagents such as HF, hydroxylamine and strong alkaline solutions often fail to provide the necessary or required cleaning and to do so with acceptable substrate compatibility. The cleaning compositions of this invention may be used alone or coupled with other cleaning solutions. Additionally, the cleaning compositions of this invention may optionally contain other components employable in microelectronic cleaning compositions, including but not limited to, alkaline bases, non-ammonium bases, acids, organic and inorganic metal chelating or complexing agents, cleaning performance enhancing additives including metal ion-free silicates, metal corrosion inhibitors, fluorides, and surfactants.<br>
[0011] A further feature of this invention comprise the discovery that the halogen oxygen acids, salt and derivatives thereof useful in this invention are stabilized, as to their available halogen, by the use therewith of a stabilizer component that is a triazole, thiazole, tetrazole or imidazole. This stabilization feature is particularly applicable to microelectronic cleaning compositions of this invention containing an oxidizer selected from halogen oxygen acids, organic salts of halogen oxygen acids, particularly organic salts of hypochlorous acid, and especially alkyl hypochlorites and tetraalkylammonium hypochlorites.<br>

[0029] The cleaning capability of such microelectronic cleaning compositions of this invention is illustrated by the following tests in which a microelectronic structure that comprised a silicon wafer of the following structure, namely photoresist (PR)/carbon doped oxide (CDO)/Nitride/Copper vias was cleaned. In a first test, the microelectronic structure was first immersed in a 10:1 solution of commercially available CLk-888 cleaner/residue remover (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc) and 30% hydrogen peroxide at 75°C for 30 minutes and then immersed, in a second step, in Composition A of Table 1 and then the structure was water washed. Composition A removed 97% to 99% of all PR (bulk PR and tough "skin") and stubborn via residues. Composition A also exhibited excellent substrate compatibility since there was no CDO etch. Similarly, in a second test employing Compositions G from Table 2, a first microelectronic structure that comprised a silicon wafer of the following structure, PR/CDO via, was immersed in Composition G of Table 2 for 30 minutes at 40°C and then water rinsed, and a second microelectronic structure of the same composition was immersed in Composition I of Table 2 for 30 minutes at 40°C and then water rinsed. Compositions G and I both removed 97% to 99% of all PR (bulk PR and tough "skin") and 100%<br><br>
stubborn via residues.    Compositions G and I also exhibited excellent substrate compatibility since there was no CDO etch.<br>

Preparation A<br>
To a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask was added 152.8g of 25% TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide). Chlorine gas was introduced in a slow bubbling rate for approximately 6 minutes to give a yellow solution (with a weight gain of 18.25g). To this resulting yellow solution was added additional 33.8g of 25% TMAH to give an intermediate solution. After removing 3.5g for pH measurements, additional 3.1g of 25% TMAH was added to the remaining solution to give a yellow solution of TMAOCI (tetramethylammonium hypochlorite) mixture. This mixture was calculated to contain the following components: 15.2% (wt) TMAOCI, 13.2% TMACI, 0.9% TMAH, and 70.8% water. The available chlorine was calculated to be about 8.6%.  A cleaning formulation<br><br>

[0032] The excellent cleaning performance and substrate compaibilities of such metal-free cleaning compositions of this invention are illustrated by the results of the following experiments. The copper, tantalum and tungsten etch rate for cleaning compositions of this invention are demonstrated by the etch rate data in the following Table 4. The etch rate was determined for Composition  TMAOCI-Solution B utilizing the following test procedure. Pieces of copper, titanium and tungsten foil of approximately 13 x 50 mm were employed. The weight of the foil pieces was measured. After cleaning the foil pieces with 2-propanol, distilled water and acetone and the foil pieces are dried in a drying oven. The cleaned, dried foil pieces were then placed in loosely capped bottles of preheated TMAOCI-Solution B cleaning compositions of the invention and placed in a vacuum oven for a period of from two to twenty-four hours at the indicated temperature. Following treatment and removal from the oven and bottles, the cleaned foils were rinsed with copious amounts of distilled water and dried in a drying oven for about 1 hour and then permitted to cool to room temperature, and then the etch rate determined based on weight loss or weight change.<br><br><br>
[0033] The dielectric and barrier etch rates for the TMAOCI-Solution B Composition of this invention against various dielectrics and barriers were evaluated by the following test procedure. The film thickness of the wafer pieces is measured using a Rudolph Interferometer and/or ellipsometer. The wafer pieces (with dielectric or barrier material deposited on silicon wafers) were immersed in the designated cleaning compositions at 45°C for 30 minutes, followed by rinsing with de-ionized water and drying under nitrogen flow/stream. The thickness was then measured again following the treatment and the etch rates were then calculated based on the change in film thickness, which are produced by the indicated treatments. The dielectric or barrier etch rates with the TMAOCI-Solution B Composition were as set forth in Table 5.<br><br><br>
[0034] The cleaning performance of the metal-free halogen oxygen acid salt containing compositions, TMAOCI-Solution A and TMAOCI-Solution B, is illustrated by the cleaning results set forth in Table 6 in which the cleaning compositions of this invention were employed to clean silicon wafers of various microelectronic structure as detailed in the Table.<br><br>
