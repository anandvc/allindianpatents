Description<br>
Pot spinning device<br>
The invention pertains to a pot spinning device.<br>
In pot spinning, the spun thread is deposited as socalled<br>
spinning cake in a pot-1 ike or tube-shaped body. This yarn body has to be rewound on to a sleeve introduced into the spinning pot, whereby a spinning cop results, as one already known from the ring spinning machine. Such a spinning cop can be forwarded to a winding machine for rewinding. Hence, pot spinning requires an additional process stage as compared to ring spinning.<br>
In order to accelerate and automate the rewinding of the spinning cake on to the empty sleeve and the changing of the spinning cop, it is already known from DE 43 24 039 A1 , that the empty sleeves are held on the thread guide during spinning and automatically get deposited on carrying bodies of a conveyor system, which also brings in empty sleeves.<br>
In the doffing process according to the known method, it is necessary that the spinning cop gets pulled down with its sleeve in its entire length from the thread guide tube and the empty sleeve has to be pushed on to the thread guide tube. As such a<br><br>
-3-<br>
doffing process takes place outside the spinning pot, one requires more than double the length of a sleeve, in addition to the spinning pot heights as overall height, in order to be able to carry out a changing process. This increases the overall height of the spinning station and hence also the machine. Besides, the required expenses and botheration are very high, in order to achieve a stable and precise straight guiding along the long running path of the doffing fixture and the thread guide, especially with respect to taking up of the sleeves by the thread guide tube and the depositing of the spinning cop on the carrier body.<br>
It is the task of this invention to improve the automatic doffing process in a pot spinning machine. This task is fulfilled in a manner at described hereinbelow.<br><br>
4<br>
As compared to the known doffing process, the doffing according to the invention is significantly simpler, in that the yarn carrier itself takes over the function of a thread guide On its circumference area the yarn body gets deposited, whereas the inner hollow space serves the purpose of thread guiding Especially as compared to pot spinning machines in which doffing of a sleeve pushed through the thread guide tube is automated, the overall height of a spinning station can be significantly reduced, because for doffing only the height of the yarn carrier drawn out of the pot is required, which again takes over the function of the thread guide<br>
As the inner side of an usual yarn carrier has too wide an inner space to be able to allow a precise centric guiding of the thread in the spinning pot axis, in an advantageous design of the invention the tube acting as thread guide tube is fixed centrically to the centre line of the tube with the usual sleeve diameter<br>
Simple in the production is a yarn carrier which is designed as a solid body, e g. made of light plastic in sleeve form with a central hole functioning as thread guide tube.<br>
For automatic handling, the yarn carrier has in one end, a device for stopping and centering, which for example could consist of a groove rotating on the outer circumference, which grips into a gripping tool The exit opening of the thread is then arranged opposite to the device of stopping and centering While equiping machines with yarn carriers, in order to avoid an alignment towards a thread exit opening, a symmetric design of the yarn carriers would be advantageous, i e. a both-sided arrrangement of exit openings and stopping and centering devices<br>
In order to ensure a safe and smooth depositing of the thread, especially in the socalled cop stroke for setting up the yarn positions of the spinning cake, the deflecting edge of the exit opening serving the purpose of thread guiding lies for the thread above the sleeve edge, viewed in longitudinal direction of the yarn carrier This prevents a possible unwinding of the thread once again off the sleeve edge, which could influence the spinning condition and the yarn property of the thread negatively<br>
It is advantageous if the mouth piece in which the thread exit opening lies, is protected to a great extent against wear and can be easily replaced in case of wear and damage Replaceable<br><br>
5<br>
mouth pieces made of metal or ceramic fulfil this specification and allow an easy replacement in case of wear<br>
The invention is described in more details on the basis of design examples<br>
The following are shown in the drawings accompanying this specification<br>

carrier is situated against the thread attaching auxiliary for threading in of the fibre<br>
band,<br>

Fig 1 schematically shows a pot spinning device 1 as per the invention. By the stretching mechanism designated overall with 2, of which two shift roller pairs 3 and 4 and a conveyor roller pair 5 are shown, the roving yarn 6 is stretched to a fibre band 7 and fed in the arrow direction 8 into a stationary injector 9 as pneumatic attaching auxiliary With the help of the compressed air fed through the pipe 10, regulated by the control unit 11, the fibre band 7 is introduced into the yarn carrier 12 In this, it passes through the channel or the hole 13 in order to come out of the exit opening 14 as thread, which is not shown here The presence of the fibre band 7 is registered by a sensor 15 and reported through the signal line 15a to the control unit 11 The yarn carrier 12 is carried by a holder which is overall designated 16 The holder 16 consists of an arm 17 with a centering and gripping device 18. This consists of a cone-shaped recess 19 in which the yarn carrier 12 to be held is centered in a pre-given position and held by a gripper 20 The gripper 20 consists of two slides 21a and 21b arranged<br><br>
6<br>
horizontally in the arm 17, which lie opposite to one another and each have (not shown here) a semi-circular opening. By means of the respective activator 22a or 22b both the slides 21a and 21b, can be regulated by the control unit 11 through the line 23 and made to move towards each other or away from each other, which is shown clearly by the double arrows 24a or 24b<br>
So that the yarn carrier 12 can be held, it has a rotating groove 25 at the end according to the present design example If a yarn carrier 12 is supposed to be gripped by the centering and gripping device 18, then the holder 16 is first lowered over the ready empty yarn carrier 12 The lifting and lowering of the holder 16 takes place in this present design example by means of a pneumatic cylinder 26 In addition to that, the yarn 17 of the holder 16 is fixed on to the piston 27 of the lifting and lowering device 26. By means of appropriate compressed air feeding and discharging through the line 28a and 28b, regulated by the control unit 11, the holder 16 can be lifted or lowered as indicated by the double arrow 29<br>
If the centering and gripping unit 18 with open gripper 20 has been lowered into an empty yarn carrier 12, then it also centers itself with its head in the cone-shaped recess 19 Subsequently, regulated by the control unit 11, the slides 21a or 21b are pushed against one another through the activator 22a or 22b, so that they grip into the groove 25 In this way the yarn carrier can be held safely Besides, the opening 30 is allocated centrically to the channel 13 in the conical flange-shaped recess 19 A conical flange 31 raises itself above the conical flange-shaped recess 19 on the arm 17 which is centric to the opening 30 This serves the purpose of coupling on to the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9 This also has a centering ring 33 around the exit opening 32 which is shaped in such a way that it can take up the conical flange 31 of the holder 16 on placing on to the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9. The opening 30 which carries out the conical flange-shaped lifting 31, then gets aligned with the exit opening 32 of the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9 and the channel 13 in the yarn carrier 12. Thus it is possible to feed the fibre band 7 into the channel 13 in the yarn carrier 12 with the help of the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9 This situation is illustrated in fig 1<br>
Below the yarn carrier 12 stands an empty spinning pot 34 in position for start of the spinning It is driven by a motor 35 which is controlled through the line 36 by the control unit 11, as indicated by the arrow 37. The axis 68 of the spinning pot 34 aligns with the channel 13 of the yarn carrier 12 The spinning pot 34 with its drive 35 is supported on a lifter beam 38 which can be lifted or lowered by a lifting and lowering unit 39 for the spinning process as well<br><br>
7<br>
as for changing of the yarn carrier, as indicated by the double arrow 40 In this present design example, the lifting and lowering device cosists of a pneumatic cylinder 41 Its piston 42 connected to the lifter beam 38 is lifted and lowered by means of appropriate regulation of the fed compressed air through the line 43a or 43b by the control unit 11<br>
For starting the spinning, the yarn carrier is lowered by the lifting and lowering mechanism 26 into a position as shown in the arrow direction 44, till its exit opening 14 stands ready at the level 45 for depositing of the first thread windings in the spinning pot. The formation of the spinning cake in the spinning pot results by lifting the spinning pot from the shown position according to the arrow direction 46 with the help of the lifting and lowering mechanism 39, whereby for formation of the socalled cop winding, the arm 17 of the sleeve holder 16 traces a changing movement between the upper position 47 and the lower position 45, as indicated by the double arrow 49 The changing movement is executed by the lifting and lowering mechanism 26 One can also think of a fixed spinning pot and a holding fixture which executes the position building as well as the total stroke So that the thread does not spread over the entire front side 14a during execution of the cop stroke, it rises towards the exit opening 14 in a smooth conical shape Besides, the deflector edge 73 of the exit opening 14 serving the purpose of thread guiding, protrudes over the front side 14a In this design example, a transport mechanism 15 is foreseen, which for example consists of a conveyor belt with an upper side 51a and a lower, side 51b Guides 52 are attached sideways in the upper side 51a of the conveyor belt, in order to guide the transport holder 53 to the transporting-in of empty yarn carriers and for transporting away of spinning cops The construction of the transport holder is described in details in fig. 6<br>
After rewinding of the spinning cake on to the yarn carrier 12, the empty spinning pot is driven to its initial position shown in fig 1. The arm 17 of the holder 16 is driven to such a position that the exit opening 14 of the yarn carrier 12 stands at the height of the drawn in position 54 Then the entire lifting and lowering mechanism 26, which is fixed on a rotating disc 55, is swivelled towards the transporting fixture 50. This swivel movement, indicated by the arrow 56, is executed by a motor 57 whose pinion 58 drives the rotating disc 55 The motor 57 gets the command for swivelling through the control line 59 of the control unit 11<br>
In this present design example, a transport holder 53 with a wound yarn carrier, a spinning cop 60, stands ready for transporting off on the transporting mechanism 50 It is held by a stopper<br><br>
8<br>
61 consisting of a swivellable lever 62 which is swivelled by an activator 63 on to the conveyor belt 53a, when it is regulated by the control unit 11 through the signal line 64 The stopper holds the transport holder for the spinning cops or yarn carrier in the transition position 65, as illustrated here<br>
If the arm with the spinning cop released from the spinning pot 34 has reached the transition positon 65, it is lowered in the arrow direction 66 to such an extent, till the arm 17 has reached the dashed-line position 17' and the yarn carrier 12' has been set into the transport holder 53 Thereafter the gripper 20 is opened, the arm 17 is lifted and the spinning cop 60 can be transported away after release by the stopper 61 Behind the empty transport holder 53 there could be a transport holder which brings in an empty yarn carrier, which is not shown here If the transport holder 53 is in the transition position 65, then it is held tight by the stopper 61 By lowering the arm 17 again to the position 17' and closing the gripper 20, the empty yarn carrier can be removed from the transport holder 53 and swivelled in the region of the spinning pot Then, by moving up the yarn carrier on to the pneumatic attaching the auxiliary 9, the fibre band for a fresh spinning operation can be fed in<br>
Fig 2 shows the situation shortly before rewinding of the spinning cake on to the yarn carrier The spinning pot 34 is reached to its highest position 67. At the same time, the yarn carrier 12 has been moved away over its lowest changing position 48 to such an extent that it sits with its exit opening 14 on a plate 69 attached centrically and ratable around the spinning pot axis 68 in the spinning pot In this case, the stretching mechanism 2 is stopped by means of the control unit 11 The spun thread 70 which gets drawn into a spinning cake 71 formed before the mouth 14 in the spinning pot, is clamped in so that the rewinding operation of the spinning cake 71 directly sets in on to the yarn carrier 12<br>
After the spinning cake 71 has been completely rewound on to the yarn carrier and thus a spinning cop 60 has resulted, as shown in fig 1, the spinning pot is lowered to the positioned shown in fig 1. The spinning cop 60 is then swivelled in the transition position 65, as already described above During swivelling, the fibre band 7 also tears off on the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9<br>
In fig 3, one of the possible design forms of the yarn carrier is shown in an enlarged version This yarn carrier 112 is designed as double tube A thin pipe 75 with a channel 76 which has<br><br>
9<br>
the usual diameter for thread guiding pipes of about 3 mm, is centrically attached to the axis 77 of a pipe 78 surrrounding the pipe 75 This pipe has an external diameter which is usual for sleeves used in pot spinning, e g 20 mm. Whereas the pipe 75 could be made of metal, the external pipe 78 could be of plastic, cardboard or also metal The outer pipe 78 and the inner pipe 75 are each connected at the upper end and the lower end to one another by a cap which closes the opening of the outer pipe Thereby the upper cap 79 has the rotating groove 25 for holding the yarn carrier in the holder 16 The front side 18a of the lower cap 80 rises with an angle of a few degrees in a conical shape to the exit opening 14 of the pipe 75, so that the thread coming out is not drawn over the sleeve. Due to this reason, the deflector edge 73 of the pipe 75, its mouth piece 75a, protrude by a few milimeters over the lower sleeve cap For establishing a safe connection of the pipe 75 which guides the thread on to the pneumatic attaching auxiliary 9, the inlet 81 of the fibre band could also similarly protrude by a few milimeters over the upper flat cap 79. The cap and the pipe could, depending on the material, be either pasted or soldered to one another<br>
Fig 4 shows the enlarged view of a yarn carrier 212, which is manufactured as solid body, for example made of plastic This plastic body 82 has a hole 84 as thread channel centric to the centre axis 83, which similarly also has the usual diameter of a known thread guiding pipe in pot spinning The outer diameter 85 of the yarn carrier 212 can be adapted to the desired sleeve diameter and could lie between 16mm and 20mm Even this yarn carrier has a rotating groove 25 at its upper end for stopping and centering. The lower front side 86, in which the exit opening 14 of the thread channel 84 is arranged centrically to the centre axis 83, similarly rises to the exit opening 14 of the thread in a smooth conical manner, so that during the cop stroke the thread does not roll off additionally over the outer edge of the yarn carrier As this design example of the yarn earner shows, the exit opening 14 is the opening of a mouth piece 87 which is screwed in with a thread 88 in the body 82 and can be replaced If the deflector edge 89, over which the formed thread rolls off, is damaged or worn out, then the mouth piece 87 can be screwed out and exchanged with a new mouth piece For better holding of the thread positions on the circumference area of the plastic body, their circumference area can be structured, e g by grooves of low depth, which is not shown here<br>
The yarn carrier 312 which is shown similarly enlarged fig 5 is a symmetric yarn carrier because it has exit openings 14 on both sides which lie in mouth pieces 90 or 91 Both front sides 92 or 93 rise to the respective mouth pieces in the shape of a cone. Also here, the<br><br>
10<br>
deflector edges 102 or 103 for the thread protrude over the front sides 92 or 93. The body 94 of the yarn carrier 312 can similarly be a massive body through which the channel 95 runs from mouth 90 to mouth 91 At both ends of the yarn carrier 312, a groove 25 is created concentric to the circumference for centering and stopping These yarn carriers have the advantage that they do not have to be first aligned for an automatic handling Each of the mouths 90 or 91 is shaped in such a way that, along with the front sides 92 or 93 they fit into the correspondingly designed conical flanged-shaped recess 19 of the centering and gripping mechanism 18 and hence can be connected to the opening 30 for feeding the fibre band<br>
In fig 6, a possible design form of a transport holder 53 is shown enlarged in section. On the plate-shaped base plate 96, the holding element 97 elevates itself. On the basis of a used massive yarn carrier 212 it is apparent that its front side 86 tapers into a ring-shaped flange 98 The centric opening 99 allows space for the mouth piece 87 which thereby does not get any contact to the holding element A ring-shaped recess 100 which surrounds the flange 98 prevents that the outer edge 105 of the yarn carrier 212 gets jammed with the holding elements 97 The yarn carrier gets tapered on its outer circumference by a supporting face 101 of the holding element 97 The holding element 97 in the region of the supporting face 101 can be divided in a glider shape, which on account of the yieldability of the holding element 97 resulting therefrom, allows an easier taking out or inserting of the yarn carrier in the region of support face 101, this has not been shown here<br><br>
