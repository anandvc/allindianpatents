The following specification describes the invention.<br><br><br>
"EXTENDED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING ALFUZOSIN AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an extended release oral pharmaceutical composition comprising alfuzosin or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, enantiomers or mixtures thereof, an Âµ1 -Adrenoceptor antagonist for the treatment of urinary disorders associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and method of preparing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alfuzosin hydrochloride is a quinazoline derivative, selective and competitive alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist that belongs to the chemical class of 4-amino-6, 7-dimethoxy quinazol-2-yl-alkylene diamines. It distributes preferentially in the prostate compared with plasma, and decreases the sympathetically controlled tone of prostatic smooth muscle. As a result lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are improved.<br>
Alfuzosin has a short -half life about 3 to 5 hours and is more intensely absorbed at the duodenum and jejunum than in subsequent portions of the GI tract. This means, most of the release of drug is required in the stomach or at the upper parts of intestine and therefore gastro retentive or floating in the acidic medium or contents is a suitable dosage form to achieve required release of the drug over a period of time. The extended release formulation of alfuzosin hydrochloride controls the symptoms associated with the BPH as effectively as immediate release and have additional advantages, better patient compliance, reduced fluctuations of plasma drug levels and reduced toxicity. Presently alfuzosin controlled release tablets are available in the market (UROXATRAL in USA-triple layer tablet). However there are no floating dosage forms are available<br><br><br>
which are more suitable for such drugs. The technology of floating systems, particularly suitable for controlled delivery of drugs that are absorbed greatly in upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract with a specific absorption window.<br>
The US 20060062846 (Mathias S. et al, 2006) discloses the controlled release of Alfiizosin in the monolithic polymeric matrix which releases the drug over a period of time but does not float in the gastric fluids.<br>
US 20040115259 (Frederique B. et al, 2004) discloses a method for producing a tablet containing alfiizosin, which comprises where the quantity of active principle is homogeneously mixed with a quantity of carrier of between 50 and 99.9% of the total weight, the carrier being chosen from among at least one compound from the family of cellulose derivatives and/or Povidone derivatives and/or polyvinyl acetate derivatives ; the mixture is compressed to produce a homogeneous monolithic tablet that floats immediately , in the gastric medium. The invention also covers on the tablets obtained. In the present invention polymeric systems are different and easy to implement and cost effective process for commercial preparation(is this statement and the final system produced floats on to the acidic medium. The floating dosage form finally obtained floats on to the aqueous medium independent of pH, which is advantageous as GIT pH varies.<br>
Abstract of WO/2006/021692 which describes about pharmaceutical composition in the form of a gastric resident matrix tablet, comprising an active principle, characterized in that when contacted with an environment representing a gastric fluid, it increases after fifteen minutes in volume by swelling rate of at least 200%. The drawback of this could be rate of swelling is much more where dose dumping can be expected accidentally and or swelling is too much where stomach fullness can be felt all the time by patients.<br>
WO2006063858 (Grenier P. et al, 2006) describes pharmaceutical composition containing coated floating particles. The dosage form comprises these particles comprising an inner drug containing core, an intermediate layer surrounding said core<br><br><br>
and a release rate-controlling outer coating. This product contains more manufacturing steps and commercially tedious.<br>
Therefore there exist a need in order to get improved, simple and cost effective composition which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art reported compositions of Alfuzosin.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved, simple and cost effective composition and process of preparation of the extended release floating system, comprising alfuzosin or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, enantiomers or mixtures thereof, by using drug release retarding agents without using any gas generating excipients.<br>
