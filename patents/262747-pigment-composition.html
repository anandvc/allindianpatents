				<td>PIGMENT PREPARATION<br>
The invention relates to a solid pigment preparation comprising a pigment and a<br>
dispersant resin, to processes for preparing a pigment preparation and a coating<br>
composition, and to the use of a dispersant resin.<br>
International patent application WO 03064540 describes granular pigments with an<br>
average particle size of 50 to 5,000 ÔÅ≠m essentially comprising at least one pigment<br>
and at least one non-ionic surface-active additive based on polyethers. The non-<br>
ionic surface-active additive may be a pure polyalkylene oxide, such as<br>
polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide. Particularly suitable are alkylene oxide<br>
based block copolymers obtainable by polyaddition of alkylene oxides to aliphatic<br>
or aromatic alcohols or amines. The pigment preparations are described as being<br>
suitable as stir-in pigments. Stir-in pigment preparations are dry, generally powdery<br>
pigment concentrates comprising a pigment and a dispersing agent and can be<br>
incorporated into a matrix, such as a coating composition, by simple stirring without<br>
the need of an additional dispersing step, hence the name stir-in pigment<br>
preparation.<br>
Although the known pigment preparations can be satisfactorily used in applications<br>
having lower requirements with respect to colour strength and colour accuracy,<br>
some properties of the known pigment preparations are insufficient for, e.g., paints<br>
for refinishing of vehicles. More particularly, when difficult-to-disperse high-<br>
transparency pigments are used, the paint properties require improvement. The<br>
compatibility with different let-down binder systems is not always optimal either.<br>
Accordingly, the invention seeks to provide a pigment preparation comprising a<br>
pigment and a dispersant resin which can be used as a stir-in pigment preparation,<br>
leading to a paint containing stable, well dispersed pigments. The pigment<br>
preparation should be easy to incorporate into coating compositions in which the<br><br>
pigments are stably dispersed. In addition, it should be possible to prepare the<br>
pigment preparation with a wide range of pigments. The pigment preparation<br>
should allow the preparation of paint having excellent properties and stability,<br>
especially in the case of difficult-to-disperse-and-stabilize pigments. The pigment<br>
preparation should be compatible with a wide variety of different let-down binder<br>
systems.<br>
The invention now provides a solid pigment preparation comprising a pigment and<br>
a dispersant resin, wherein the composition comprises at least 35% by weight of at<br>
least one pigment and at most 65% by weight of dispersant resin, calculated on the<br>
combined weight of pigment and dispersant resin, and wherein the dispersant resin<br>
comprises a polyester backbone having at least one pendent hydrophilic<br>
polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group, the dispersant resin comprising 30 to<br>
80% by weight of alkylene oxide units and having a number average molecular<br>
weight of 1,000 to 150,000.<br>
It should be noted that international patent application WO 9507951 describes<br>
aqueous coating compositions wherein an amphiphatic emulsifier is used to<br>
emulsify generally lipophilic, crosslinkable binders without the need for significant<br>
amounts of organic co-solvents. The amphiphatic emulsifier comprises a polyester<br>
backbone having pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether groups.<br>
The pigment preparation of the invention can be used as a stir-in pigment<br>
preparation, leading to a coating composition containing stable, well dispersed<br>
pigments. The pigment preparation can be easily incorporated into coating<br>
compositions in which the pigments are stably dispersed. In addition, it is possible<br>
to prepare the pigment preparation with a wide range of pigments. The pigment<br>
preparation allows the preparation of paint having excellent properties and stability,<br>
especially in the case of difficult-to-disperse-and-stabilize pigments. Furthermore,<br><br>
the pigment preparation is compatible with a wide variety of different let-down<br>
binder systems.<br>
The pigment preparation of the invention may comprise an inorganic or an organic<br>
pigment. Alternatively, the pigment preparation may comprise a plurality of different<br>
pigments, for example two or more inorganic pigments, two or more organic<br>
pigments, or a mixture of one or more inorganic pigments and one or more organic<br>
pigments.<br>
The pigment particles within the preparation are generally present in finely divided<br>
form. Accordingly, the pigments typically have average particle sizes within the<br>
range of 50 nm to 5,000 nm. Preferably, the average particle size is at least 80 nm,<br>
more preferably at least 100 nm. It is preferable that the average particle size is at<br>
most 3,000 nm, more preferably at most 1,500 nm, and most preferably at most<br>
1,000 nm.<br>
The average particle size of the pigment particles within the preparation can for<br>
example be determined by electron microscopy. Since the average particle size of<br>
the pigments within the preparation is essentially the same as the average particle<br>
size of the pigments after they are stirred into a liquid, it is also possible to mix the<br>
pigment preparation with a liquid medium and to determine the average pigment<br>
particle size by dynamic light scattering.<br>
The organic pigments are typically organic chromatic and black pigments.<br>
Inorganic pigments can likewise be colour pigments (chromatic, black, and white<br>
pigments) and also luster pigments and the inorganic pigments typically used as<br>
fillers.<br>

As mentioned above, the pigment preparation of the invention comprises as<br>
essential ingredients a pigment and a dispersant resin, wherein the composition<br>
comprises at least 35% by weight of at least one pigment and at most 65% by<br>
weight of dispersant resin, calculated on the combined weight of pigment and<br>
dispersant resin. When the pigment in the preparation is carbon black, it is<br>
preferred that the content of carbon black in the pigment preparation is in the lower<br>
part of the described range. Thus, when the pigment is carbon black, the pigment<br>
preparation preferably comprises at least 40% by weight, more preferably at least<br>
45% by weight of carbon black, and at most 60% by weight, preferably at most<br>
55% by weight of dispersant resin, calculated on the combined weight of pigment<br>

comprises at least 60% by weight, preferably at least 64% by weight, more<br>
preferably at least 68 % by weight, and most preferably at least 70% by weight of<br>
at least one pigment, and at most 40% by weight, preferably at most 36% by<br>
weight, more preferably at most 32% by weight, and most preferably at most 30%<br>
by weight of dispersant resin, calculated on the combined weight of pigment and<br>
dispersant resin. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the above-mentioned<br>
weight ratios of pigment and dispersant resin also apply when calculated on the<br>
total weight of the pigment preparation.<br>
The pigment preparation may further comprise other ingredients, additives or<br>
auxiliaries commonly used in pigment preparations, such as organic solvents,<br>
wetting agents, anti-foaming agents, heat stabilizers, light stabilizers, antioxidants,<br>
and other pigment dispersion aids and/or surfactants.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the pigment preparation of the invention is a free-flowing<br>
powder which is suitable for use as a stir-in pigment. Also solid compacted pigment<br>
preparations can be used, for example in the form of pellets or tablets.<br>
The polyester backbone of the pigment dispersant resin to be used in the pigment<br>
preparation and process according to the invention can be prepared according to<br>
generally known esterification reactions of building blocks having ester-forming<br>
functional groups. Examples of ester-forming functional groups are carboxylic acid<br>
groups, (cyclic) carboxylic anhydride groups, carboxylic ester groups, hydroxy<br>
groups, epoxide groups, oxetane groups, and lactone groups. In order to form a<br>
polyester, at least a part of the building blocks used must have a functionality of at<br>
least 2. However, mono-functional and tri- or higher functional building blocks can<br>
be used as well.<br>
Examples of suitable building blocks are dicarboxylic acids such as sebacic acid,<br>
dodecanedioic acid, octenyl succinic acid, dodecenyl succinic acid (any isomer or<br>
mixture of isomers), as well as dimer fatty acids. Examples of carboxylic<br>
anhydrides are decanoic anhydride, dodecanoic anhydride, dodecyl succinic<br>
anhydride, and dodecenyl succinic anhydride.<br>
Hydroxycarboxylic acids and lactones derived therefrom, such as gamma-<br>
decanolactone, can also be used.<br>
Examples of cycloaliphatic polyols include 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexane diol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane, bis-hydroxymethyltricyclo-<br>
decane, and mixtures thereof. Examples of aliphatic polyols include glycerol, 1,2-<br>
propane diol, 1,3-propane diol, 2-methyl-1,3-propane diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-<br>
hexane diol, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, 1,2,6-hexane triol,<br>
pentaerythritol, ditrimethylol propane, propoxylated pentaerythritol, ethoxylated<br>
trimethylol propane, dimethylol propionic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Preferred diols include 1,2-ethane diol, 1,2-propane diol, 1,3-propane diol, 3-<br>
methyl-1,3-propane diol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol, dimethylol propionic acid,<br>
and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol.<br>
Suitable cyclic polycarboxylic acids include aromatic polycarboxylic acids and<br>
cycloaliphatic polycarboxylic acids. Examples of aromatic polycarboxylic acids<br>
include isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, and mixtures thereof. Also<br>
included are the esters or the anhydrides thereof, such as phthalic anhydride,<br>
trimellitic anhydride, and mixtures thereof. Examples of cycloaliphatic poly-<br>
carboxylic acids include 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclohexane<br>
dicarboxylic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, endomethylene tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
hexahydrophthalic acid, methyl hexahydrophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof. Also<br>
included are the esters or the anhydrides thereof, such as tetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride, endomethylene tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride, methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of acyclic polycarboxylic acids include malonic acid, succinic acid,<br>
glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, and mixtures thereof. Also included are the<br>
esters or the anhydrides thereof, such as the dimethyl ester and the diethyl ester of<br>
malonic acid, succinic anhydride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
It is to be understood that the at least one pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide<br>
monoalkylether group is generally linked to the polyester backbone via a covalent<br>
bond. The at least one pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether<br>
group can be introduced by using building blocks having ester-forming functional<br>
groups and at least one pending polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group in the<br>
esterification reaction. Examples of compounds having two ester-forming functional<br>
groups and a pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide based group are derived from<br>
triols wherein one hydroxyl group is blocked with a polypropylene or polyethylene<br>
oxide based segment terminated with an ether group. A commercially available<br>
example of such a diol is Tegomer D 3403 ex Tego Chemie Service GmbH,<br>
Germany.<br><br>
Alternatively, it is possible to introduce the at least one pendent hydrophilic<br>
polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group in a post-polymerization reaction, i.e. to<br>
first prepare the polyester backbone and subsequently graft the at least one<br>
pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group to the backbone.<br>
For this latter route it is particularly suitable to prepare the pigment dispersant resin<br>
by the addition reaction of<br><br>
(i) a hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoamine monoalkylether of the<br>
formula<br>
wherein R is the residue of a monoepoxide compound after reaction<br>
with an amine group, R1 is selected from C-1 to C4 alkyl groups, n is 0<br>
to 25, m is 1 to 50, with the proviso that n+m ÔÇ£ 50, and<br>
(ii) a polyester backbone having electron depleted carbon-carbon double<br>
bonds.<br>
It is preferred that R in formula (I) is the residue of a monoepoxide compound<br>
having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms after reaction with an amine group, R1 is a<br>
methyl group, n is 2 to 4, and m is 16 to 20. It is particularly preferred that R is the<br>
residue of a monoepoxide compound of the general formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R2 is an alkyl group with 4 to 10 carbon atoms, after reaction with an<br>
amine group.<br>
Examples of suitable monoepoxide starting materials for the preparation of<br>
compounds according to formula (I) are epoxidized olefins, such as epoxidized ÔÅ°-<br>
olefins; glycidyl ethers of monohydroxy compounds, such as ethylhexyl glycidyl<br>
ether, butyl glycidyl ether, hexyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether; and glycidyl<br>
esters of carboxylic acids, such as propionic acid glycidyl ester, hexanoic acid<br><br>
glycidyl ester, ethylhexanoic glycidyl ester, decanoic glycidyl ester, and versatic<br>
acid glycidyl ester, commercially available from Hexion under the name Cardura¬Æ E<br>
10.<br>
Examples of suitable amine starting materials for the preparation of compounds<br>
according to formula (I) or (II) are polyalkylene oxide based amines, which are<br>
commercially available from Huntsman under the trade designation Jeffamine¬Æ M.<br>
The polyester backbone having electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bonds can<br>
be prepared as described above from building blocks having ester-forming<br>
functional groups. Electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bonds can be<br>
introduced by using building blocks having ester-forming functional groups and at<br>
least one electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bond in the esterification<br>
reaction. Examples of compounds having ester-forming functional groups and an<br>
electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bond are maleic acid, maleic anhydride,<br>
fumaric acid, itaconic acid, itaconic anhydride, citraconic acid, citraconic anhydride,<br>
as well as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and ester-forming derivatives thereof.<br>
Building blocks having two ester-forming functional groups and at least one<br>
electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bond are preferred. The most preferred<br>
building block having two ester-forming functional groups and at least one electron-<br>
depleted carbon-carbon double bond is maleic anhydride.<br>
The polyester backbone having electron-depleted carbon-carbon double bonds can<br>
be prepared in a single-stage reaction or in two or more reaction stages. The<br>
number average molecular weight of the polyester backbone generally is in the<br>
range of 500 to 120,000. Preferably, the number average molecular weight of the<br>
polyester backbone is below 80,000, more preferably below 40,000, and most<br>
preferably below 20,000.<br><br>
The pigment dispersant resin suitably has a low acid value; preferably, the acid<br>
value of the pigment dispersant resin does not exceed 5 mg KOH/g, calculated on<br>
non-volatile matter of the dispersant resin.<br>
As mentioned above, the number average molecular weight of the pigment<br>
dispersant resin is in the range of 1,000 to 150,000. Preferably, the number<br>
average molecular weight does not exceed 50,000.<br>
The pigment dispersant resin optionally comprises other functional groups, for<br>
example hydroxy groups. It is preferred that the hydroxyl value of the dispersant<br>
resin is in the range of 10 to 300 mg KOH/g, calculated on non-volatile matter of<br>
the dispersant resin.<br>
Further, the pigment dispersant resin optionally comprises carbon-carbon double<br>
bonds (C=C bonds), for example when only a part of the unsaturation of the<br>
polyester backbone has been reacted with a hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide<br>
monoamine monoalkylether. Preferably, the C=C equivalent weight of the<br>
dispersant resin is in the range of 100 to 50,000 g/equivalent.<br>
As mentioned above, the dispersant resin comprises at least one pendent<br>
hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide based side group per molecule. It is preferred that<br>
the dispersant resin comprises at least two, more preferably at least three pendent<br>
hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide based side groups per molecule. In a typical<br>
embodiment, the polyester backbone of the dispersant resin is essentially linear<br>
and preferably lipophilic, having pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide side<br>
groups. Such polymers may also be described as comb polymers.<br>
Examples of suitable alkylene oxides are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and<br>
butylene oxide. It is preferred that the polyalkylene oxide based side groups are<br>
based on ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or mixtures thereof. So far very good<br><br>
results have been obtained with polyalkylene oxide based side groups at least 50%<br>
by weight, preferably 70% by weight of which is based on ethylene oxide,<br>
calculated on the total weight of the polyalkylene oxide based side group.<br>
As mentioned above, the dispersant resin which comprises a polyester backbone<br>
having at least one pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group,<br>
the dispersant resin comprising 30 to 80% by weight of alkylene oxide units and<br>
having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 150,000, can be used for<br>
the preparation of a stir-in pigment preparation.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for preparing a pigment preparation<br>
comprising the steps of<br>
a)	stirring a pigment and a dispersant resin, optionally with added water or<br>
organic diluent, to form a fiuidized pigment slurry,<br>
b)	optionally, milling the slurry, and<br>
c)	drying the slurry,<br>
wherein the dispersant resin comprises a polyester backbone having at least one<br>
pendent hydrophilic polyalkylene oxide monoalkylether group, the dispersant resin<br>
comprising 30 to 80% by weight of alkylene oxide units and having a number<br>
average molecular weight of 1,000 to 150,000.<br>
As mentioned above in respect of the pigment preparation, the pigment used in the<br>
process can be an organic or an inorganic pigment. It is also possible to use a<br>
mixture of pigments, for example a mixture of two or more inorganic pigments, a<br>
mixture of two or more organic pigments, or a mixture of inorganic and organic<br>
pigments. It is possible to use a large variety of pigments in the process. The<br>
pigments can be introduced into the process as standard dried powdery pigments.<br>
The milling step serves to break up agglomerates and to achieve the required<br>
pigment particle size. Organic pigments are also available as so-called press<br>
cakes. Organic pigments, when synthesized, are in the form of very small crystals,<br><br>
called primary particles. The aim of pigment synthesis is to produce primary<br>
particles of a size that optimizes pigment application properties such as colour<br>
strength, tone and brightness, flow properties, and transparency or opacity. The<br>
press cake contains the pigment essentially in this disaggregated form. Hence,<br>
less energy is required to break up agglomerates and to achieve the required<br>
pigment particle size. During drying of the pigment press cake in the absence of<br>
dispersant resin, primary particles will join together to form aggregates and<br>
agglomerates. Therefore, when an organic pigment is used in the process, it is<br>
possible and preferred to use the organic pigment in the form of a pigment press<br>
cake. When pigment press cakes are used, simple stirring of the fluidized pigment<br>
slurry may be sufficient to achieve the required pigment particle size. Milling of the<br>
slurry may be redundant in such cases.<br>
When additional liquid is required to fluidize the mixture of pigment and dispersant<br>
resin, it is preferred that the liquid is water. Instead of water or in addition to water<br>
organic solvents may be used, such as glycols or glycol ethers, for example<br>
ethylene glycol or higher homologues thereof or ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl<br>
ether.<br>
The optional milling step can be carried out using well-known milling equipment<br>
usually employed for breaking down the particle size of pigments. Examples of<br>
suitable equipment for carrying out the process are bead mills, jet mills, ultrasonic<br>
mills, basket mills, roll mills, and high-speed dissolvers. Milling is generally<br>
continued until the average particle size is within the range of 50 nm to 5,000 nm.<br>
Preferably, the average particle size is at least 80 nm, more preferably at least 100<br>
nm. It is preferable that the average particle size is at most 3,000 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 1,500 nm, and most preferably at most 1,000 nm.<br>
Examples of suitable methods of drying are spray granulation and fluidized bed<br>
drying, spray-drying, drying in a paddle dryer, evaporation and subsequent<br><br>
comminution, and freeze-drying. The selected method of drying may influence the<br>
particle size of the pigment preparations of the present invention. The drying step<br>
is preferably carried out by freeze-drying or by spray-drying.<br>
Spray and fluidized bed granulation may produce coarsely divided granules having<br>
average particle sizes from 50 to 5,000 urn and especially from 100 to 1,000 ÔÅ≠m.<br>
Depending on the process conditions, spray-drying may also produce finely divided<br>
pigment preparations. Spray-drying may for example produces granules having<br>
average particle sizes 
drying in a paddle dryer and by evaporation with subsequent grinding.<br>
The residual moisture content of the dried solid pigment preparation obtained can<br>
vary significantly. The residual moisture content may for example be 15% by<br>
weight, calculated on the weight of the total pigment preparation. Generally, the<br>
residual moisture content does not exceed 15% by weight, preferably it does not<br>
exceed 12% by weight. In many cases, the residual moisture content is even less<br>
than 5% by weight. When the pigment preparation is intended for use in non-<br>
aqueous systems, a low residual moisture content is particularly preferred, for<br>
example less than 2% by weight.<br>
In use, the pigment preparations of the present invention are notable for their<br>
excellent colour properties, especially with regard to colour strength, brilliance, hue<br>
and hiding power, and especially for their stir-in characteristics, i.e. they can be<br>
dispersed in application media with a minimal input of energy, simply by stirring or<br>
shaking.<br>
The pigment preparations of the present invention additionally have the following<br>
advantages: they have a high pigment content, exhibit very good stability in<br>
storage, are both economically and ecologically advantageous with regard to<br>
packaging, storage, and transportation, and they are more flexible in use.<br><br>
The pigment preparations of the present invention are very useful for pigmenting<br>
macromolecular organic and inorganic materials of any kind. Liquid application<br>
media in this context can be purely aqueous, comprise mixtures of water and<br>
organic solvents, for example alcohols, or be based exclusively on organic<br>
solvents, such as alcohols, glycol ethers, ketones, e.g. methylethyl ketone, amides,<br>
e.g. N-methyl pyrrolidone and dimethyl formamide, esters, e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl<br>
acetate, and methoxypropyl acetate, or aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g.<br>
xylene, mineral oil, and mineral spirits. It is preferred to use the pigment<br>
preparation of the invention for pigmenting water borne coating compositions.<br>
Examples of materials which can be pigmented with the pigment preparations of<br>
the present invention include: coatings, for example architectural coatings,<br>
industrial coatings, automotive coatings, radiation-curable coatings, powder<br>
coatings; paints, including paints for building exteriors and building interiors, for<br>
example wood paints, lime washes, distempers, emulsion paints; solvent borne<br>
printing inks, for example offset printing inks, flexographic printing inks, toluene<br>
intaglio printing inks, textile printing inks, radiation-curable printing inks; water<br>
borne inks, including inkjet inks; colour filters; building materials (water is typically<br>
added only after the building material and the pigment preparation have been dry-mixed),<br>
for example silicate render systems, cement, concrete, mortar, gipsum;<br>
bitumen, caulks; cellulosic materials, for example paper, paperboard, cardboard,<br>
wood and woodbase, which can each be coated or otherwise finished; adhesives;<br>
film-forming polymeric protective colloids as used for example in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry; cosmetic articles; plastics; and detergents.<br>
The pigment preparations of the present invention are particularly useful as mixing<br>
components in colour-mixing or -matching systems. Owing to their stir-in<br>
characteristics, they can be used directly as a solid for this purpose. If desired,<br>
however, they may also be first converted into base colors, mixing varnishes, and<br>
tinting colours (especially into colours having a high solids content, "HS colours"),<br><br>
or even more highly pigmented tinting pastes, which then constitute the<br>
components of the mixing system. The matching of the desired hue and hence the<br>
mixing of the colour components can be effected visually via a system of colour<br>
cards in a very large number of hue gradations based on colour standards, such as<br>
RAL, BS, and NCS, or preferably under computer control, whereby an unlimited<br>
number of hues become accessible ("computer colour matching"). A process for<br>
preparing a pigmented coating composition comprises mixing with stirring, in any<br>
workable order, the pigment preparation of the present invention, at least one film-<br>
forming binder, and at least one liquid diluent.<br>
