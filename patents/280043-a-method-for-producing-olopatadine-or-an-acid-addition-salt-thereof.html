DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING DIBENZOXEPIN COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
a dibenzoxepin compound which is useful as a medicament, and<br>
particularly to a method for producing (Z)-ll-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepin-2-<br>
acetic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
(Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenzo [b, e] oxepin-2-acetic acid (common name:<br>
olopatadine) is a compound represented by the formula [IV]:<br>
 <br>
It is known that this compound or an acid addition salt thereof<br>
is a pharmaceutical compound useful as an antiallergic drug<br>
which is applied for allergic rhinitis, urticaria and so on (JP<br>
5-86925B).<br>
Since olopatadine that is a Z-isomer is usually produced<br>
with its E-isomer in chemical synthesis of olopatadine,<br>
isomerization is required so as to efficiently obtain a Z-isomer<br>
that is an objective substance.<br>
 <br>
JP 5-86925B and JP 7-116174B describe that, when the<br>
objective substance is obtained as a cis-trans mixture (E-Z<br>
mixture), the cis-trans mixture can be separated by column<br>
chromatography or recrystallization and, if necessary, a<br>
cis-isomer (Z-isomer) can be isomerized into a trans-isomer<br>
(E-isomer) by refluxing in acetic acid in the presence of a<br>
proper acid catalyst such as paratoluenesulfonic acid for 1 to<br>
24 hours. However, these documents do not describe about<br>
isomerization of an E-isomer into a Z-isomer.<br>
Further, J. Med. Chem., 35, 2074-2084 (1992) describes<br>
that methyl 11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepin-2-acetate is saponified to obtain a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid as a mixture of an E-isomer and<br>
a Z-isomer at a mixing ratio of 1:2 and the E-isomer is isolated<br>
from the mixture using a column, and then an acetic acid solution<br>
of the E-isomer is heated at 100°C for 21 hours in the presence<br>
of paratoluenesulfonic acid, and isomerization arises to obtain<br>
a mixture of the E-isomer and the Z-isomer at a mixing ratio<br>
of 65:35.<br>
However, according to the isomerization method described<br>
above, the objective substance of the Z-isomer could not be<br>
efficiently obtained.<br>

 <br>
be isolated by conventional separation means such as<br>
chromatography.<br>
Typical examples of the alkyl group represented by R1,<br>
R2 and R3 include a methyl group and an ethyl group.<br>
In the present invention, the tertiary alkyl ester of<br>
11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo<br>
[b, e] oxepin-2-acetic acid represented by the above formula [I]<br>
is preferably t-butyl 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>
6,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,e]-dibenzoxepin-2-acetate represented<br>
by the formula [V] shown below.<br>

and hydrogen chloride. Trifluoroacetic anhydride is<br>
preferable. These dehydrating agents may be used alone, or two<br>
or more kinds of dehydrating agents may be used in combination.<br>
The amount of the dehydrating agent to be used is usually from<br>
about 1 mole to 10 moles, and preferably from about 1 mole to<br>
2 moles, per 1 mole of the compound [I].<br>
The dehydration reaction temperature is usually from<br>
 <br>
about 20°C to 70°C, and more preferably about 40°C to 60°C. The<br>
dehydration reaction time varies depending on the reaction<br>
temperature, the amount of raw material to be used, and so on.<br>
It is usually from about 1 to 8 hours, and preferably from about<br>
2 to 4 hours. This reaction is preferably carried out under<br>
stirring.<br>
In the present invention, olopatadine represented by the<br>
formula [IV]:<br>
 <br>
or an acid addition salt thereof can be produced by treating<br>
the above mixture of the compound [II] and the compound [III],<br>
obtained by treating the above compound [I] with a dehydrating<br>
agent, with an acid.<br>
Examples of the acid include hydrogen chloride (hydrogen<br>
chloride gas or hydrochloric acid) and sulfuric acid, and<br>
hydrogen chloride gas is particularly preferable. The amount<br>
of the acid to be used is preferably from about 1 mole to 5 moles<br>
per 1 mole of the mixture of the compound [II] and the compound<br>
[III].<br>
The method of charging raw materials in a reactor is<br>
preferably a method in which the mixture of the compound [II]<br>
and the compound [III] dissolved in a solvent is charged by<br>
adding dropwise in a heated solvent. The dropwise addition time<br>
 <br>
varies depending on the amount of the solvent, and is usually<br>
from about 30 minutes to 10 hours, and preferably about 1 to<br>
5 hours, when 1 kg of the mixture of the compound [II] and the<br>
compound [III] is used. When hydrogen chloride is used as the<br>
acid, it is preferred to add dropwise the mixture of the compound<br>
[II] and the compound [III] dissolved in the solvent while the<br>
hydrogen chloride gas is bubbling.<br>
The reaction temperature is usually from about 50°C to<br>
150°C, and preferably from about 80°C to 110°C. The reaction<br>
time varies depending on the reaction temperature, raw<br>
materials to be used, and so on. It is usually from about 3<br>
to 20 hours, and preferably from about 5 to 10 hours, when 1<br>
kg of the mixture of the compound [II] and the compound [III]<br>
is used. This reaction is preferably carried out under<br>
stirring.<br>
The solvent is preferably an organic solvent. Examples<br>
of the organic solvent include ketone solvents (for example,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone,<br>
cyclopentanone, etc.) and aromatic solvents (for example,<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene,<br>
nitrobenzene, etc.), and chlorobenzene is preferable. The<br>
amount of the solvent to be used is not particularly limited<br>
as long as the amount enables complete dissolution of the<br>
mixture of the compound [II] and the compound [III]. It is<br>
usually from about 5 L to 40 L, and preferably from about 10<br>
 <br>
L to 20 L, per 1 kg of a mixture of the compound [II] and the<br>
compound [III].<br>
Thus, isomerization from an E-isomer to a Z-isomer of the<br>
resultant compound proceeds simultaneously with the<br>
deesterification reaction of the compound [II] and the compound<br>
[III]. A compound [IV] can be obtained, as an acid addition<br>
salt corresponding to the acid used, by cooling the reaction<br>
solution after isomerization proceeded nearly completely,<br>
collecting the precipitated crystal through filtration, and<br>
washing the crystal with a proper solvent (for example, acetone,<br>
etc.). Typical examples of the acid addition salt include<br>
hydrochloride and sulfate. Further, a free compound [IV] that<br>
is not an acid addition salt can be usually obtained by an alkali<br>
treatment.<br>
t-Butyl 11-hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepin-2-acetate in the present invention<br>
can also be nomenclatured as, for example, t-butyl (11-hydroxy-<br>
ll- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepin-<br>
2-yl)acetate.<br>
