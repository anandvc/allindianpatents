COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
DEVICE AND METHOD FOR SEPARATING A FLOWING MEDIUM MIXTURE INTO FRACTIONS<br><br><br>
2. APPLICANT:<br>
Name: ROMICO HOLD A.V.V.<br>
Nationality: Dutch<br>
Address: Schottegatweg Oost 32, Willemstad, Curacao, The Netherlands.<br><br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a device for separating a flowing medium mixture into at least two fractions with differing mass density, comprising rotating means for rotating the flowing mixture for separating. The invention in particular relates to a method for separating a flowing medium mixture into at least two fractions with differing mass density.<br>
The separation of a flowing medium mixture has very diverse applications. Medium mixture is here understood to mean a mixture of solid and/or liquid and/or gas particles of micron or sub-micron size dispersed in at least one liquid or gas. Examples are a gas/gas mixture, a gas/liquid mixture or aerosol, a liquid/liquid mixture, a gas/solid mixture, a liquid/solid mixture, or such a mixture provided with one or more additional fractions. The separation of a flowing medium mixture is for instance known from various applications of liquid cleaning, (flue) gas cleaning and powder separation. Separation of fractions with a great difference in particle size and/or a great difference in mass density is relatively simple. Large-scale use is made for this purpose of processes such as filtration and screening. In the separation of fractions with a smaller difference in mass density use is made of chemical separating techniques and/or separating techniques such as sedimentation and centrifugation. Certainly when processing large volumes of medium mixture, chemical separating techniques are less economic and usually also less environmentally-friendly. Separating fractions by means of sedimentation requires time and, when processing larger volumes of medium mixture, makes it necessary to make use of voluminous reservoirs, which is, among other things, expensive. Another per se known technology makes use of the differences in mass density of the fractions for separating by applying a centrifugal force to the mixture by causing the mixture to rotate in a centrifuge or a cyclone. This technique is not usually sufficiently selective to realize a separation of the desired level in a short time.<br>
A known device of the type stated in the preamble is described in NL 8700698. The known device comprises rotating means in the form of a rotating assembly of feed channels for rotating the flowing mixture for separating, a feed for the medium mixture to be separated connecting to the rotating means, an outlet connecting to the rotating means for discharging the fractions of the separated medium mixture. In a rotating feed<br>
2<br><br>
channel the heavier fraction of the mixture for separating is moved further outward toward the wall thereof than the lighter fraction under the influence of the centrifugal force, thus resulting in a separation. A drawback of the device known from NL 8700698 is that it can only be used at relatively low pressures, whereby separation proceeds more slowly than is desirable. The selectivity of the separation is also capable of improvement.<br>
A similar device is disclosed in WO 2005/118110A1. This document on page 3, lines 3-5 mentions the possibility of carrying the medium to be separated through the feed channels under turbulent flow conditions, although laminar flow in the feed channels is preferred. Dependent on the particular process conditions, the device (and particularly the channel dimensions) can be selected accordingly.<br>
The present invention has for its object to provide a device and method with which, with limited investment, inter alia the speed and the quality of the separation of fractions of a flowing medium mixture can be increased.<br>
The invention provides for this purpose a method for separating a flowing medium mixture into at least two fractions with differing mass density, comprising the processing steps of: A) supplying a medium mixture for separating, B) causing rotation of the flowing mixture for separating in rotation means provided for this purpose which comprise a rotating assembly of feed channels, with the proviso that the flow of the medium mixture in the feed channels is substantially turbulent, and C) discharging at least one of the separated fractions, wherein the rotational speed of the assembly of feed channels satisfies the condition<br><br>
wherein is the rotational speed, T represents the treatment time in the feed channel, L and dh represent respectively the length and the hydraulic diameter of the feed channel, and α is smaller than 3. In the method according to the invention wherein : and<br>
wherein is given by<br><br>
the separating process will generally proceed very effectively and will not be noticeably disrupted by internal circulations. It has been found that in methods wherein <br>
3<br><br>
internal circulations adversely affect the process such that the increased yield from separation of particles as a result of rotation more rapid than can be lost. Since higher rotational speeds result in higher material loads and more energy consumption, there are farther advantages in practice to limiting the rotational speed to values which amount to a maximum of wherein α=2, or more preferably a maximum of:  wherein α=l. The method according to the invention is most preferably characterized in that a is between 0.5 and 1.<br>
The method according to the invention is based on the insight that under particular processing conditions, in particular below a critical rotational speed of the rotating assembly of feed channels, a separation efficiency can be achieved under turbulent flow conditions which is comparable to separation efficiencies, typically obtained under laminar flow conditions.<br>
The method according to the invention is preferably performed such that during processing step B) the Reynolds number of the flow in at least one feed channel is greater than 2500, and still more preferably greater than 5000. The method can be performed with a relatively small throughflow device since the separate processing steps can be carried out at high pressures and within a very short period of time, for instance in less than 1 second, usually in less than 0.1 second or even in less than 10 or less than 5 milliseconds. As already described above, the method is preferably performed at a pressure of at least 10 bar, and more preferably at least 100 bar. Lengthy processes, with associated devices which are dimensioned such that they can contain large volumes, are hereby rendered unnecessary.<br>
The device and method according to the invention can in principle be applied for the separation of all conceivable medium mixtures into at least two fractions. A preferred embodiment is characterized in that at least one fraction comprises solid particles. The best results are achieved with the invented device in the separation of such a preferred mixture.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention there is supplied to the device a medium mixture comprising particles, the average diameter d of<br>
4<br><br>
which satisfies d &gt; 2 dp100% , wherein dpl00% represents the diameter of a particle which in laminar flow reaches the wall of the feed channel at the downstream end thereof under the influence of the occurring centrifugal forces. This characteristic diameter dp100% can be readily defined by the skilled person, for instance by experimentation or by caJculation.<br>
Additional advantages are achieved if the diameter d of the particles satisfies d &gt; 2.5 dp1oo%- It has been found that particularly under these conditions a rapid separation can be achieved without this necessarily being to the detriment of the degree of separation. When particles are presented with a particle size distribution with the stated average diameter, it is found possible to achieve almost the same separating efficiency as in the case of the known method, where laminar flow occurs in the feed channels.<br>
The method according to the invention can be carried out in a device of which at least one of the feed channels is dimensioned such that the medium mixture displays a substantially turbulent flow therein. The Reynolds number in the feed channels is preferably greater than 2000, more preferably greater than 2500, still more preferably greater than 3000, and most preferably greater than 5000. Dimensioning at least one of the feed channels for given process conditions such that a substantially turbulent flow is created therein, and carrying out the method of separation according to the process conditions of the invention surprisingly achieves that the speed of separation can increase without this necessarily having an adverse effect on the separating capacity of the device. This is surprising since it is generally assumed that a turbulent flow in the feed channels excites secondary flows therein which impede migration of the heavier fraction to the wall of the feed channels. This is particularly the case for medium mixtures in which the fraction for separating comprises particles, and in particular solid particles, with dimensions at micron and submicron level. The device according to the invention can therefore be applied particularly advantageously to separate such a medium mixture. A mixture to be separated in particularly advantageous manner with the device according to the invention comprises solid particles of a diameter varying from about 0.1 to about 5 micron.<br>
A preferred variant of the device according to the invention comprises feed channels with singly-connected cross-section. In-a first variant this is understood to mean that<br>
5<br><br>
each feed channel has a cross-section extending along practically the whole length thereof which extends azimuthaJly around the rotation axis at an angle smaller than 360° such that the azimuthal flow at an angle greater than 360° to the rotation axis is substantially prevented. In a second variant a singly-connected cross-section is understood to mean that each feed channel extends azimuthally around the rotation axis at an angle smaller than 360° such that azimuthal flow at an angle greater than 360° to the rotation axis is substantially prevented in each feed channel, wherein each feed channel is provided with wall portions extending substantially along the total length thereof, wherein the separation is bounded in radial and azimuthal directions relative to the rotation axis. In a third variant a singly-connected cross-section is understood to mean that each feed channel extends azimuthally around the rotation axis at an angle smaller than 360° such that azimuthal flow at an angle greater than 360° to the rotation axis is substantially prevented in each feed channel, wherein each feed channel is enclosed by a single wall extending substantially along the whole length thereof.<br>
Although the number of feed channels can in principle be chosen within wide limits, it is recommended that the number of feed channels in radial direction amounts to at least 5, such as for instance 15 to 1000, more preferably at least 30 and most preferably at least 50. The at least 5 feed channels preferably extend almost mutually parallel to the rotation axis.<br>
It is noted that in the context of the invention separating of the fractions is understood to mean at least partly separating the fractions such that a significant difference in the average mass density of the two fractions results; a complete (100%) separation will be difficult to realize in practice. As a result of the rotation of the mixture of the fractions for separating, the lighter fraction will migrate at least substantially to the inner side of the rotation and the heavier fraction will migrate at least substantially to the outer side of the rotation. A possible application is a separation which increases the options for use of at least one of the fractions relative to the mixture. This usable ("cleaned") fraction may still have a part of another undesired fraction even after separation ("be contaminated with another fraction"), but the presence of this other fraction is significantly smaller than the presence of this undesired fraction in the original mixture. The rotating separator in the form of a rotating assembly of feed channels has the advantage that the average distance of the medium from a wall (in radial direction)<br>
6<br><br>
remains limited, whereby a desired degree of separation can be achieved in relatively short time (this corresponding to a relatively limited length in axial direction of the rotating separator in combination with a high axial speed, so that more flow rate can be processed). The flow speeds to be applied can be varied or optimized according to the situation. The processing of the medium, wherein it is guided through at least one feed channel under turbulent conditions, results in an unexpectedly high separation efficiency without voluminous equipment being required for this purpose (i.e. the device can take a very compact form) and wherein the medium only has to be treated in the device for a short period.<br>
A device can be given an even smaller form (with a smaller volume) if the medium mixture is carried through the device under higher pressure. A preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention therefore comprises pressure means for feeding the medium mixture under pressure to the feed channels, preferably for a pressure which can amount to at least 10 bar, and more preferably for a pressure which can amount to at least 100 bar. The known device for rotating separation of a medium mixture comprises feed channels which are dimensioned such that the flow in the channels is laminar. In order to ensure laminar flow in all feed channels the Reynolds number Re must be smaller than 2000, wherein Re is defined by<br><br>
wherein w0 is the average axial speed of the medium mixture through the feed channels, v represents the kinematic viscosity of the medium mixture and dh is the hydraulic diameter of the feed channel. The hydraulic diameter is defined by<br><br>
with Ao the surface area of the cross-section of the channel and S the circumference. The kinematic viscosity can be calculated with<br>
v = μ /p<br>
7<br><br>
wherein p is the dynamic viscosity and p the density of the medium mixture. The invention is based on the surprising insight that a turbulent flow may prevail in at least part of the feed channels without this having an adverse effect on the separation of the medium mixture into two fractions with differing mass density. The at least one feed channel is dimensioned according to the invention such that a substantially turbulent flow occurs herein under chosen process conditions. Because the Reynolds number depends on the process conditions (more precisely on the average axial speed w0of the medium mixture through the feed channels, and on the hydraulic diameter dh of the feed channels), and on the kinematic viscosity af the medium mixture (which in turn also depends on the process conditions), the dimensions of the at least one feed channel are determined on the basis of the chosen medium mixture and the chosen process conditions, and more precisely on the basis of the window of process conditions chosen for the device. Once this window is determined for a given medium mixture, the dimensions of the least one feed channel can be readily determined from the above stated formula for the Reynolds number.<br>
For gases the order of magnitude of μ is 10-5 kg/(ms). At atmospheric pressures the density of gases is about 1 kg/m3 so that v is of the order of magnitude of 10-5 m2/s. In order to ensure laminar flow in the feed channels in the known rotating particle separator, the process conditions and the channel dimensions are chosen in practice such that the Reynolds number is significantly lower than 2000, and generally amounts to about 1000. In the known separating process wo will be in the order of magnitude of 5 m/s and dh in the order of magnitude of 2 mm. The device according to the invention can be operated at much higher pressures and/or higher throughput speeds than the known device. When the medium mixture - for instance a gas mixture - is brought to pressure, the density thereof will increase while the dynamic viscosity generally changes only a little. When the pressure is increased to for instance 10 bar, the kinematic viscosity can soon become a factor of 10 smaller, and the Reynolds number can hereby rise to a value of 10,000. At a pressure of 100 bar the Reynolds number can rise to a value of about 100,000 and higher. The device according to the invention can be operated at such high pressures without the throughflow surface of the feed channels unnecessarily having to be enlarged for this purpose. This enhances the separating efficiency of the device. High pressures are usual in many practical applications, including particle separation in the process industry and the oil and gas industry.<br>
8<br><br>
The feed channels of the rotating means of the device can have any desired form. It is thus possible to have them run in a random curve in the lengthwise direction or, conversely, make them almost linear. Although not necessary for the invention, a plurality of feed channels will generally be formed by singly-connected walls positioned substantially mutually parallel to the rotation axis of the rotation means. In the known device for separating a medium mixture into at least two fractions the walls of the feed channels must run almost parallel to the rotation axis of rotation means. If this is not the case, the component of the rotation in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the feed channel can then cause a Coriolis force, whereby an internal eddying is created in the feed channel in the plane perpendicularly of the channel axis, this having a particularly adverse effect on the separating process. An additional advantage of the invented device is that, even with feed channels with an axis forming an angle p differing from zero with the rotation axis of the rotation means, it has a good separating efficiency. The device according to the invention is therefore less critical in operation than the known device.<br>
It has been found that it is advantageous when the angle p is chosen such that β 
For the best possible operation it is desirable to have the mass density of the fractions for separating differ as much as possible. If desired, the device according to the invention can be provided for this purpose with means influencing mass density which are situated in front of the rotation means, and are therefore disposed upstream in the flow direction of the medium. The means influencing mass density can for instance comprise expansion means. By means of (optionally isotropic) expansion the temperature of a medium can be decreased within a very short time, for instance by applying an expansion cooler of the "joule thomson" type or a turbine. Another option is that the cooling is brought about by a cooling medium, which is for instance<br>
9<br><br>
expanded in a separate circulation system so as to be thus brought to the desired low temperature level. The density of the fractions is affected by temperature decrease. Particularly favourable effects can thus be achieved if the mixture consists of fractions with the same phase (for instance gas/gas mixture or a liquid/liquid mixture), at least one fraction of which undergoes a phase change due to the temperature change such that the phases of the fractions for separating differ from each other (whereby for instance a gas/liquid mixture, a gas/solid mixture or a liquid/solid mixture results). This phenomenon of phase change of a substance as a result of temperature change is of ■ course a generally known phenomenon. It is however expressly noted that for the separation by means of the rotating means it is not essential to create a phase difference between the components for separating; the device is equally applicable to a mixture of fractions which are in the same phase (for instance liquid/liquid mixtures such as a dispersed liquid and gas/gas mixtures). Some examples of possible applications of the present invention are the separation of an air/nitrogen mixture, de-aerating or degassing of water, dehydrating of air, cleaning of natural gas and the like.<br>
The method according to the invention is applied particularly for purifying natural gas. In such a preferred application of the method natural gas is supplied during processing step A), during an additional processing step the temperature of the natural gas is lowered as a result of expansion to a temperature lower than -50°C, or less than -60°C, whereby the fractions of contaminated substances present in the natural gas, such as for instance CO2 and H2S, at least substantially change phase, which contaminated fractions (for instance CO2 and H2S) are separated from the fraction of hydrocarbons during processing step B) such that the fraction of hydrocarbons with the contaminants at least partly removed is discharged during processing step C). Using this preferred method technically recoverable natural gases contaminated with unwanted gases can be separated to a sufficient extent in economically cost-effective manner from the hydrocarbons present therein.<br>
The method and device according to the invention can also be used to separate condensable liquid-like constituents in natural gas, such as for instance the water vapour present in natural gas or the heavier fractions thereof. By cooling the medium mixture for instance prior to the separating step, such constituents condense into droplets. The thus formed droplets are then separated from the other constituents in the feed channels.<br>
10<br><br>
Natural gas can thus be dried in an efficient manner. It is also possible, for instance in the case the heavier fraction is being separated, to collect the thus formed petrochemical product.<br>
The present invention will be further elucidated on the basis of the non-limitative<br>
exemplary embodiments shown in the following figures. Herein:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic view of a device according to the invention,<br>
figure 2 shows schematically the progression of the degree of separation in percent with<br>
the normalized particle diameter, and<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic view of an alternative embodiment variant of a multiple<br>
separating device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device 1 for cleaning a contaminated gas such as for instance natural gas. The contaminated gas is supplied as according to arrow P1 by a feed 2 under a pressure which can vary from 100 to 500 Bar and higher (a typical pressure amounts for instance to about 250 Bar) and a temperature of more than or about 100°C. The gas supplied as according to arrow 1 is then cooled in accordance with the shown preferred method in a heat exchanger 3, for instance by means of cooling into the atmosphere. The cooled gas flows from heat exchanger 3 as according to arrow P2 to a throttle valve 4. The gas supplied as according to arrow P2 is expanded by means of throttle valve 4, preferably in isotropic manner, to a lower pressure of between 5 and 20 Bar. As a result of the sudden fall in pressure the temperature of the gas will fall (for instance to a temperature lower than -50°C) such that a part of the fractions present in the gas changes phase. A gas/vapour mixture 5 (aerosol) is created as a result. This gas/vapour mixture 5 is carried through feed channels 6 of a rotor 7 as a result of the rotation R, whereby the vapour condenses against the sides of feed channels 6 of rotor 7 which are remote from a rotation shaft 8. For pressures lying between 5 and 20 bar the kinematic viscosity v of the gas/vapour mixture 5 will be in the order of magnitude of 10" m /s. Although it is apparent that the throughfeed speed of the gas/vapour mixture 5 through feed channels 6 can be chosen within broad limits, the axial throughfeed speed w0 usual for economic operation will generally be in the order of magnitude of 5 m/s. On the basis of the normal process conditions the diameters of feed channels 6 are chosen such that the Reynolds number in channels 6 amounts to at least 2000. In the shown preferred variant feed channels 6 have a hydraulic diameter of 2 mm, this corresponding to a<br>
11<br><br>
Reynolds number of about 10,000. The flow in feed channels 6 is therefore substantially turbulent. The condensed vapour leaves rotor 7 as liquid droplets 9 on the side remote from throttle valve 4. Droplets 9, which consist for instance of liquid CO2 and H2S, are collected in a basin 10 which can be emptied by means of activating a pump 11 such that the liquid CO2 and H2S are discharged as according to arrow P3. The gas leaving rotor 7 thus has CO2 and H2S at least partly removed and leaves device 1 as according to arrow P4 as cleaned gas. It is expressly stated that, while the use of a heat exchanger 3 and a throttle valve 4 is recommended, these components are not however essential to the invention.<br>
The particle material collected in the feed channels can be removed there from by removing the rotating assembly of feed channels from its housing, subsequently cleaning and re-placing it, or by replacing it with a cleaned rotating assembly. The rotating assembly of feed channels can also be cleaned in situ - if necessary during operation - by subjecting it for instance to vibrations, by producing sound waves or, preferably, by spraying the feed channels under high pressure or by spraying with air or another gaseous or liquid medium.<br>
By ensuring according to the invention that during operation a substantially turbulent flow is created in feed channels 6, time-dependent and location-dependent fluctuations in the velocity field will occur in addition to an average stationary axial flow. As a result the fraction particles to be separated make a zigzag movement around the average path corresponding to the path in laminar flow. This path is determined by the average axial speed and the stationary path directed radially outward as a result of the centrifugal force produced by rotor 7. In the absence of turbulence there will be a precisely 100% chance of a particle with diameter dp100% being collected. During its stay in a feed channel 6 such a particle therefore undergoes, as a result of the centrifugal force, a radial displacement equal to the diameter of channel 6. Because according to the invention a substantially turbulent flow is present in channels 6, it can be expected that the collection efficiency of particles with diameter dp100% will be lower (for instance reduced from 100% to about 80%) than in the known device, which is dimensioned such that a laminar flow prevails in feed channels 6 thereof. Figure 2 shows the progression of the degree of separation 20 (or collection efficiency) set out against the normalized fraction diameter 21 which, in the context of this application, is defined as<br>
12<br><br>
the ratio of the average diameter dh of the fraction for separating of gas/vapour mixture 5 and the average diameter dp100% of this same fraction which in a laminar flow would be completely separated at the end of feed channels 6. This average diameter dp100% can be determined experimentally in simple manner by for instance modifying the process conditions such that a laminar flow is created in the feed channels. It is also possible to reduce the channel diameter for this purpose. Curve 22 shows the progression for the known device (laminar flow in feed channels 6), curve 23 shows the progression for the device according to the invention (turbulent flow in feed channels 6). In contrast to what might be expected, figure 2 shows that the degree of separation 20 is not noticeably less than for laminar flow, despite the fact that the throughfeed speed can be higher. It is moreover found that for particles smaller than about 0.5 dp100% and larger than 2.5 dp100% the degree of separation 20 in the device according to the invention even lies at the same level as for the known device.<br>
Figure 3 finally shows a view of a multiple separating device 30 to which a mixture for separating is supplied as according to arrow P30-.After cooling of the mixture in a cooler 31, the now cooled mixture flows to a turbine 32 as according to arrow P31 .After passing through turbine 32 the mixture, with now a greater difference in the mass density of the fractions for separating, flows to a schematically shown rotating separator 33. A first, for instance gaseous, fraction leaves rotating separator 33 through an outlet 34 as according to arrow P33. A second fraction (for instance a cold liquid fraction) leaves rotating separator 33 through a second outlet 35 as according to arrow P34. The second fraction is then fed to another turbine 36 and a rotating separator 37 connecting thereto, where a renewed separating process takes place for the purpose of separating as according to arrow P35 a gas fraction (which may or may not be the same gaseous fraction as already separated in rotating separator 33) remaining in the second liquid fraction, which gas fraction then flows together with the gaseous fraction already separated in the first rotating separator 33. The liquid fraction separated in rotating separator 37 is carried back to heat exchanger 31 through a return conduit 38 as according to arrow P36 in order to increase the efficiency of heat exchanger 31. In heat exchanger 31 the liquid fraction coming from the second rotating separator 37 functions as coolant before it exits device 30 via an outlet 39 as according to arrow P37. It is noted that instead of the second fraction (P34), or just as the second fraction (P34), the first fraction (P33) leaving the rotating separator 33 can also be subjected to a renewed<br>
13<br><br>
separating process by means of for instance a turbine, not shown in this figure, and a rotating separator connecting thereto which connect to outlet 34. Renewed separating of already separated fractions can optionally also be carried out more than twice in succession.<br>

We claim:<br>
1.	Method for separating a flowing medium mixture into at least two fractions with<br>
differing mass density, comprising the steps of:<br>
A)	supplying a medium mixture for separating,<br>
B)	causing rotation of the flowing mixture for separating in rotation means provided for this purpose which comprise a rotating assembly of feed channels, with the proviso that the flow of the medium mixture in the feed channels is substantially turbulent, and<br>
C)	discharging at least one of the separated fractions,<br>
wherein the rotational speed of the assembly of feed channels satisfies the condition<br><br>
wherein is the rotational speed, T represents the treatment time in the feed channel, L and dh represent respectively the length and the hydraulic diameter of the feed channel, and α is smaller than 2.<br>
2.	Method according to claim 1, characterized in that a is smaller than 1.<br>
3.	Method according to claim 2, characterized in that a is between 0.5 and 1.<br>
4.	Method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein at least one of the fractions comprises particles, the average diameter d of which satisfies d &gt; 2 dp100% , wherein dp100% represents the diameter of a particle which in laminar flow would reach the wall of the feed channel at the downstream end thereof under the influence of the occurring centrifugal forces.<br>
5.	Method according to claim 4, characterized in that at least one of the fractions comprises particles, the diameter d of which satisfies d &gt; 2.5 dp100% -<br>
6.	Method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that during processing step B) the Reynolds number of the flow in the feed channels is greater than 2500.<br>
