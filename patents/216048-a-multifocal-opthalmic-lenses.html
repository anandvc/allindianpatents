				<td>					Invention<br>
		The invention relates to ophthalmic lcnses, In particular, the invention<br>
	provides lenses that use more than one optical power, or focal length, and are useful<br>
	in the correction of presbyopia.<br>
10					Background of the Invention<br>
		As an individual ages, the eye is less able to accommodate, or bend the<br>
	natural lens, to focus on objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
	condition is known as presbyopia. Additionally, for persons who have had their<br>
	natural lens removed and an intraocular lens inserted as a replacement, the ability to<br>
15	accommodate is totally absent<br>
		Among the methods used to correct for the eye's failure to accommodate is<br>
	the mono-vision system in which a person is fitted with one contact lens for distance<br>
	vision and one lens for near vision. The mono-vision system permits the lens wearer<br>
20	to distinguish both distance and near objects, but is disadvantageous in that a<br>
	substantial loss in depth perception results.<br>
		In another type of multifocal contact lenses, the optic zone of each lens is<br>
	provided with more than one power. For example, the optic zone may have both<br>
25	distance and near power, which the eye uses simultaneously.<br>
		Neither of these methods provides good results in terms of visual acuity and<br>
	lens wearer satisfaction. Thus, a need exists for lenses that both provide correction<br>
	for the wearer's inability to accommodate and that overcome some or all of the<br>
30	disadvantages of known lenses.<br><br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
		FIG. 1 is a graphic depiction of the power maps for progressive lens designs<br>
	resulting from Equation L<br>
5		FIG. 2 is a graphic depiction of the power maps for progressive lens designs<br>

		Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
		The invention provides methods for designing lenses useful for correcting<br>
10	presbyopia, lenses incorporating such designs, and methods for producing these<br>
	lenses. In one embodiment, the method of the invention permits variation of the<br>
	speed, or contour, of the power change from distance to near vision power or near to<br>
	distance vision power. The result of this variation is that there is a better distribution<br>
	of the distance and near vision powers within the multifocal zone and, thus,<br>
15	improved visual acuity and wearer satisfaction.<br>
		In one embodiment, the invention provides a multifocal ophthalmic lens<br>
	comprising, consisting essentially of and consisting of an optic zone having one or<br>
	more multifocal power zones wherein a speed and a contour for the zone is<br>
20	determined by the following equation:<br>
Add(3) = Addpcak * (1 /(a * (1 +(x/xc)2c))<br>
										(1)<br>
	wherein;<br>
25	Add(x) is actual instantaneous add power at any point x on a surface of the lens;<br>
	x is a point on the lens surface at a distance x from the center;<br>
	a is a constant and preferably is 1;<br>
	Addpeak is the full peak dioptric add power, or sdd power required for near vision<br>

	n is a variable between 1 and 40, preferably between 1 and 20; and<br>
	Add is a value that is equal to the difference in power between the near vision power<br>
	and distance vision power of the lens.<br>
5<br>
	In Equation I, n is the variable that controls the slope of the progression from near to<br>
	distance vision power and distance to near vision power in the lens. The less the<br>
	value of n, the more gradual the progression will be.<br>
10		In a second embodiment, the invention provides a multifocal ophthalmic lens .<br>
	comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of an optic zone having one or<br>
	more multifocal power zones wherein a speed and a contour for the zone is<br>
	determined by the following equation:<br>
15				Add(r)= Addpeak *(1 /(a *(1 + (x/xc)2) * n)<br>
									(II)<br>
	(wherein:<br>
	Add(x) is actual instantaneous add power at any point x on a surface of the lens;<br>
	x is a point on the lens surface at a distance x from the center;<br>
20	a is a constant and preferably is 1:<br>
	Addpeak is the full peak dioptric add power;<br>

	n is is a variable between 1 and 40, preferably between 1 and 20; and<br>
	Add is a value that is equal to the difference in power between the near vision power<br>
25	and distance vision power of the lens.<br>
		In a third embodiment, the invention provides a multifocal ophthalmic leans<br>
	comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of an optic zone having one or<br>
	in one multifocal power zones wherein a speed and a contour for the zone is<br>
30	determined by the following equation:<br><br>
WO 2004/042454								PCT/US2003/034218<br>
4<br>
Add(I) = Addpeak *(I(a*(1 + (x/xc)4)*n)<br>
									(III)<br>
	wherein:<br>
5	Add(x) is actual instanraneous add power at any point x on a surface of the lens;<br>
	x is a point an the lens surface at a distance x from the center;<br>
	a is a constant and preferably is 1;<br>
	d is an arbitrary value between 1 and 40;<br>
	Addpeak is the full peak dioptric add power;<br>
10	Xc is the cutoff semi-diameter;;<br>
	n is between 1 and 40, preferably between 1 and 20; and<br>
	Add is a value that is equal to the difference in power between the near vision power<br>
	and distance vision power of the lens.<br>
15		For purposes of the invention, by "ophthalmic lens" is meant a spectacle<br>
	lens, contact lens, intraocular fens, or the like. Preferably, the lenses of the invention<br>
	are contact lenses.. By "speed." or "contour" is meant the slope of the power change<br>
	from near to distance power. By "distance vision power" is meant the amount of<br>
	refractive power required to correct the wearer's distance vision acuity to the desired<br>
20	degree. By "near vision power" is meant the amount of refractive power required to<br>
	correct the wearer's near vision acuity to the desired degree.<br>
		In the lenses of the invention, the multifocal power zones may be on the<br>
	object-side, or from, surface, the eye-side, or rear, surface, or both surfaces. The<br>
25	multifocai power zones have at least two regions of differing power alternating<br>
	between distance and near vision power. Intermediate power is provided as a<br>
	consequence of the power progression between the peak of the power of the near<br>
	and distance vision regions. In the lenses of the invention, the distance, near, and<br>
	intermediate optical powers are spherical or toric powers.<br><br>
30 <br>
WO 2004/042454							PCT/US2003/034218<br>
5<br>
		In Figure 1 is graphically depicted the power progression in four different<br>
	multifocal power zone designs resulting from Equation I. In each design, the near<br>
	vision power is at the center of the zone and the distance vision power is at or<br>
5	towards the periphery of the zone. By periphery is meant the region or area farthest<br>
	from the center of the zone. The values used in Equation I for each of the designs is<br>
	set forth in the following Table 1.<br><br>
10		In Figure 2 is graphically depicted the power progression for three different<br>
	multifocal power zone designs resulting from Equation I. The values used in<br>
	Equation I for each of the designs is set forth in the following Table 1.<br><br>
15<br>
		In each of Figures 1 and 2 is depicted the add power change as the power<br>
	departs from the optic center of the lens. The design of the invention provides for a<br>
	smooth, continuous variation in power from the optical center of the lens to the<br>
	periphery of the optic zone. Additionally, the design permits a controllable rate of<br>
20	change and position of the power variation.<br>
		Equations I through III each have a value of n that is the same on either side<br>
	of xc. As an alternative, the value of n can be a first value when x 
<br><br>
WO 2004/042454								PCT/US2003/034218<br>
6<br>
	second value for x&gt; xc. In this embodiment, x = xC3 n may be the first or second<br>
	value.<br>
5		The lenses of the invention may be made from any suitable lens forming<br>
	materials. IIIustrative materials for formation of soft contact lenses include, without<br>
	limitation silicone elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including, without<br>
	limitation, those disclosed in United States Patent Nos, 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and<br>

	polymers, meaning, having a peak molecular weight between about 25,000 and<br>
	about 80,000 and a polydispersity of less than about 1:5 to less than about 3.5<br>
	respectively and covalenlly bonded thereon, at least one cross-linkable functional<br>
	group. This material is described in Attorney Docket Number VTN 588, United<br>
20	States Serial NO, 60/363,630 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
		As yet another alternative, the lens material may be any material suitable for<br>
	forming ophthalmic lens other than contact lenses. For example, spectacle lens<br>
	materials may be used inducting, without limitation, polycarbonates, such as<br>
25	bisphenol A polycarbonates, allyt digtycol carbonates, such as diethylene glycol<br>
	bisallyl carbonate (CR-3 9TM) allylic esters, such as triallyl cyanurate, triallyl<br>
