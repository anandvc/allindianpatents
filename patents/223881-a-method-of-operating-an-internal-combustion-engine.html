				<td>HIGH EFFICIENCY ENGINE<br>
WITH VARIABLE COMPRESSION RATIO AND CHARGE<br>
(VCRC ENGINE)<br>
Cross-Reference To Related Application<br>
[001] This application references Provisional Application No.60/253.799<br>
filed 11/29/00; of Ken Cowans; titled, "High efficiency engine with variable compression<br>
ratio and charge; (VCRC engine)".<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[002] This invention relates to internal combustion engines designed to<br>
improve efficiency, improve power to weight ratios, and reduce emitted pollutants in a<br>
configuration which is readily manufacturable. The invention is most applicable to<br>
engines used in automotive applications.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[003] A major objective of the invention is to provide a prime mover<br>
engine, i.e. a device to derive mechanical energy from the heat energy of a burning<br>
fuel, with higher efficiency in a lighter weight and smaller configuration than has<br>
heretofore been the case; particularly at power demands less than the engine's<br>
maximum. The main use for the invention is for automobile power: For this application<br>
efficiency at low engine torque at moderate speeds is of prime interest since most of<br>
the time an automobile engine operates at approximately 10 % of its maximum power<br>
output at moderate speeds-typically 1,500 to 3,000 rpm.<br>
[004] The engineering terminology used in this specification follows<br>
standard mechanical engineering practice. Three works have been used as<br>
engineering reference. These are<br>
Avallone and Baumeister, Ed., Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical<br>
Engineers, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1996: referred to as 'Marks'.<br>
Ricardo, Harry R., The High Speed Internal Combustion Engine, Fourth<br>
Edition, Blackie &amp; Son, Ltd., 1967: referred to as 'Ricardo1.<br>
Stephenson, R. Rhoada., Should We Have a New Engine?, Jet<br>
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 1975: referred<br>
to as 'Stephenson'.<br>
[005] Current automotive practice is usually to employ a spark-ignition<br>
engine with an average thermal efficiency around 20 %; i.e. about 20 % of the thermal<br>
energy of the fuel used is transferred to mechanical energy. Alternatively, a<br>
compression-ignition engine, more commonly called a diesel engine, is used having a<br>
somewhat higher efficiency at low output. The added efficiency of the diesel engine is,<br>
in passenger car application, offset by the added weight of current diesel engines. A<br>
typical passenger car using a diesel engine is no more efficient than a car of equal<br>
performance using a spark engine. Comparisons of apparent mileage differences<br>
between spark engines and diesel engines is obscured by the difference in energy<br>
content of diesel fuel and gasoline. Diesel fuel has about 18% more energy for a given<br>
volume, liter or gallon, than does gasoline: Thus an accurate comparison of a diesel<br>
car that gave 40 mpg with a spark-engine driven car giving 32 mpg would show that the<br>
two vehicles use almost exactly the same amount of energy. Even more exact<br>
comparisons that consider performance of the two autos shows that the diesel-driven<br>
car is most often less efficient than an equivalent spark-engined vehicle. Support for<br>
this argument comes from the choice of Toyota and Honda in their choice of spark<br>
engines for the Prius and Insight vehicles respectively. These two cars are designed to<br>
provide the ultimate in fuel mileage using contemporary techniques.<br>
[006] The discussion above begins to illustrate the problem of increasing<br>
the efficiency of automobiles. It is not enough to increase maximum efficiency of the<br>
prime mover; the efficiency at low power outputs and the weight of the engine are of<br>
equal or greater importance. In order to accomplish this increase of system efficiency it<br>
is necessary to reduce engine friction; increase engine power-to-weight, and focus on<br>
increasing the efficiency of the detailed burning process in the engine. In today's<br>
environment it is also necessary to ensure that the engine does not pollute the<br>
environment. If the engine is not inherently clean any accessories added to remove<br>
exhaust pollutants to the degree needed today can easily reduce efficiency directly and<br>
the weight added for these accessories will detract from the vehicle's fuel mileage.<br>
[007] Current proposals mostly fail to globally address the complexity of<br>
this problem. Any solution that addresses internal combustion engine efficiency needs<br>
to consider the basic combustion process itself. To obtain high efficiency at very low<br>
power outputs a solution must address the problem of lean burning. Hydrocarbon fuels<br>
do not burn rapidly enough for use in an automotive sized engine at fuel-air ratios under<br>
around 50-60% of stoichiometric ratio. To obtain ultra-efficient burning at 10% of<br>
maximum power output it is necessary to efficiently combine the fuel with air at fuel air<br>
ratios around 15-20% of stoichiometric within the time it takes an engine to rotate 30-<br>
35° at around 2,000 rpm or about 3 milliseconds. No matter what is done to a bulk air-<br>
fuel mixture this has not proved feasible in workable systems.<br>
[008] Diesel engines sidestep this problem by finely dividing the fuel and<br>
spraying it into a hot air environment. The burning that results occurs around each<br>
droplet at a fuel-air ratio almost exactly stoichiometric: Thus a mixture that is nominally<br>
a bulk mixture of fuel and air at a low fuel-air ratio is really a mixture of micro-domains<br>
of fuel and air at near stoichiometric ratio. The penalties inherent in this approach<br>
include the high friction penalties attendant with the use of compression ratios around<br>
20:1 needed for automotive-sized engines and the aforementioned added weight. This<br>
illustrates that the solution must firmly address the problem of mechanical friction.<br>
[009] Friction and its effect on the part-load efficiency is largely ignored in<br>
contemporary proposed automotive prime mover solutions. The effect of friction is a<br>
very complicated factor. Typical modern production automotive engines battle friction<br>
by employing sophisticated valving and induction systems to ensure that maximum<br>
bearing loads are encountered only at moderate and higher speeds, where journal<br>
bearings can endure higher pressure loadings. This allows these same journal<br>
bearings to be designed smaller and thus the bearings contribute less friction to<br>
degrade the engine's performance.<br>
[0010] The effect of friction is especially complicated when considered in<br>
conjunction with compression ratio. A higher compression ratio in an internal<br>
combustion engine inevitably results in concomitantly increased thermal efficiency.<br>
This is unfortunately accompanied by an increase in friction because the added<br>
compression ratio is inevitably attended by added friction from the larger bearings that<br>
are needed to support the higher loads that go along with the higher compression ratio.<br>
The friction loads are particularly influential to the engine when delivering low power at<br>
moderate speed which is the normal duty for an automotive engine.<br>
[0011] It is highly desirable to realize an engine that is notably lighter and<br>
smaller for a given power output than conventional engines. It is well known that the<br>
fuel consumed by a road vehicle is approximately proportional to the vehicle's weight.<br>
Combining an increase in efficiency with lowered engine weight greatly increases the<br>
fuel efficiency of a vehicle system. This is especially true when the effects of what is<br>
called, in automotive technology, weight propagation are considered. This term<br>
describes the effects of changing the weight of any component of a vehicle system.<br>
Since the component must be carried by the vehicle system and the component's mass<br>
must be stopped by the vehicle's brakes the inevitable effect of changing the weight of<br>
any of the vehicle's components further entails a change in the weight of the vehicle by<br>
about 70% of the initial weight change. Thus a reduction of engine weight of 100<br>
pounds will result in a total weight reduction of about 170 pounds due to the effects of<br>
weight propagation.<br><br>
Internal Combustion Engine Pollutants<br>
[0012] Another objective of the invention needed in today's environment is<br>
to create a prime mover than burns fuel in a manner that is inherently clean; whose<br>
combustion process inherently produces few contaminants associated with interna!<br>
combustion engines. Such an engine will need fewer or smaller cleanup mechanisms<br>
such as catalytic converters used with it to meet increasingly stringent requirements for<br>
engines in public use.<br>
[0013] Internal combustion engine pollutants are of two general kinds:<br>
Oxides of nitrogen and unburned or partially unburned hydrocarbons (carbon monoxide<br>
production in engines can be considered as resulting from partial burning of the carbon<br>
in a hydrocarbon fuel). Diesel, or compression-ignition, engines produce particulates,<br>
microscopically small pieces of carbon and other matter due to the nature of<br>
combustion in compression-ignition engines. Well designed engines using<br>
homogeneous mixtures of fuel and air such as are burned in typical spark-ignition<br>
engines have little tendency to produce significant quantities of particulates.<br>
[0014] Oxides of nitrogen are produced when oxygen and nitrogen are<br>
heated together to very high temperatures (ca. 2,500°C and above) such as occurs in<br>
burning fuel-air mixtures. Production of nitrogen oxides is intensified when burning fuel-<br>
air mixtures are close to stoichiometric ratios. Production of oxides of nitrogen is<br>
reduced in mixtures of burning fuel and air that have an excessive amount of either fuel<br>
or air and are further reduced by burning the fuel-air mixture in conjunction with inert<br>
gasses such as recycled exhaust products (EGR). Stephenson shows data from<br>
Blumberg, P., and Kummer, J.T., "Predictions of NO Formation in Spark-Ignited<br>
Engines-An Analysis of Methods of Control", Combustion Science and Technology, Vol.<br>
4, pp 73-95. This showed that an engine produced vanishingly small amounts of<br>
nitrogen oxides when fuel was burned in an atmosphere with 40% excess fuel or air in<br>
surplus over stoichiometric proportions when a small amount of EGR was present.<br>
These data are shown in graphical form in Figure 9.<br>
[0015] Complete burning the fuel in an engine, with the consequence that<br>
small quantities of unburned hydrocarbons or carbon monoxide result from the process,<br>
is most thoroughly accomplished by burning with an excess of air over stoichiometric<br>
proportions at elevated temperatures followed by oxidation in a catalytic convertor.<br>
Thorough burning such lean mixtures, however, is not easily implemented. Uniformly<br>
mixed lean mixtures burn too slowly to be useful in an engine designed to be used at<br>
speeds of 1,000-6,000 rpm if the burning is initiated in the uniformly mixed air-fuel bulk<br>
blend.<br>
Efficiency in Internal Combustion Engines<br>
[0016] The efficiency of an internal combustion engine is determined by<br>
complicated relationships. In order to obtain an optimum efficiency it is necessary to<br>
balance many individual factors. Each of these tends to counteract, in some way or<br>
ways, the effects of the others. The main parameters that need to be considered in the<br>
design are:<br>
a. Basic thermal efficiency<br>
b. Friction between internal parts that occurs as the engine runs<br>
c. Non-linearities due to chemical interactions within the burning<br>
fuel-air mixture.<br>
d. Pressure drops that occur as air moves into the engine and<br>
exhaust products are expelled from the engine.<br>
1. Basic thermal efficiency<br>
[0017] The efficiency of a prime mover is the percentage of heat energy<br>
obtained from the fuel burning that is converted to useful mechanical energy. Indicated<br>
thermal efficiency is a term used to describe the percentage of the energy obtained<br>
from the fuel that is converted to mechanical energy within the engine even though<br>
some of this energy may not be available outside the engine due to factors such as<br>
friction within the engine and the energy used to run ancillary mechanisms needed for<br><br>
engine operation. Brake thermal efficiency is the term used to describe efficiency of the<br>
engine in terms of the percentage of heat energy of the fuel that is available outside the<br>
engine as usable energy. Friction converts some of the basic mechanical energy<br>
delivered from the engine process to heat before mechanical energy is transferred<br>
outside the engine: The difference between indicated thermal efficiency and brake<br>
thermal efficiency is thus that percentage of the heat energy used up in moving engine<br>
parts against internal friction of the engine, in pressure drops undergone by gases<br>
flowing within the engine and that energy needed to drive accessory mechanisms within<br>
the engine essential to the engine's operation. This last category includes fuel pumps,<br>
water pumps and valve gear.<br>
2. Friction of the internal parts that occurs as engine parts move<br>
[0018] As noted above, friction takes away from the net thermal efficiency<br>
of the engine. Mechanical friction in an internal combustion engine mostly originates<br>
from bearings supporting the crankshaft, rubbing of pistons on their cylinder walls and<br>
friction in the valve mechanism. Bearing and piston friction is dependent on loads<br>
within the engine. The loads will vary with the detailed design of the engine but are<br>
always a function of the compression ratio of the engine: A higher compression ratio<br>
results in larger bearing and piston loads. Marks, Section 8, shows that the size of<br>
bearings and their relative friction power loading is proportional to the load or force<br>
placed on the bearings. The data also show that journal bearings can support a load<br>
that is proportional to the notational speed of the bearing shaft.<br>
[0019] The use of a large compression ratio will increase the indicated<br>
thermal efficiency of an engine. However, a rise in the compression ratio of an internal<br>
combustion engine always gives rise to an increase in the friction of a real engine, as<br>
opposed to the engine as a theoretical entity. This results in a decrease in the average<br>
operating efficiency at compression ratios over about 8 to 1 in the case of spark ignited<br>
engines used in vehicle transport. This is clearly shown in Ricardo; one of the basic<br>
texts on internal combustion engines. The relationship that leads to this conclusion is<br>
found in the fact that most of the usage of an engine for passenger road transport in<br>
particular, and practically all prime movers in general, occurs at outputs far less than<br>
the maximum that can be derived from the engine. Thus an engine that has a high<br>
efficiency at full power with a compression ratio of 10 to 1 will be less efficient in overall<br>
passenger car usage than a correctly designed engine having a compression ratio or 8<br>
to 1 when both engines are operated at 30% of their maximum torque. This torque<br>
level is typical for passenger transportation needs and also approximately<br>
representative for many applications of prime movers. The reason for the higher<br>
efficiency of the engine using an optimum compression ratio is that the bearings and<br>
other load supporting members of the engine must be designed to be large enough to<br>
withstand the highest pressure internal to the engine that the engine will endure. This<br>
results in larger frictional losses in the engine using the higher compression ratio:<br>
These larger frictional losses are more than offset by higher indicated thermal efficiency<br>
at full torque demand but when the engine's usage on an overall basis is analyzed the<br>
average efficiency of an engine with a compression ratio of about 8 to 1 will be more<br>
efficient than that of an engine having a compression ratio of 10 to 1. The fact that the<br>
engine is used delivering a typical torque of around 30% of maximum means that the<br>
efficiency during this service is more important to average efficiency than the efficiency<br>
of the engine delivered when the engine is used at full torque.<br>
3. Non-linearities due to chemical interactions within the<br>
burning fuel-air mixture<br>
[0020] A high compression ratio also incurs some chemical losses. The<br>
efficiency gains engendered by the use of higher compression ratios are obtained<br>
because heat is extracted from the fuel at higher temperatures as the compression ratio<br>
is raised: Any heat engine is more efficient as the temperature at which the heat is<br>
added to the engine is raised relative to the temperature at which heat is rejected from<br>
the engine. This comes from basic Carnot teachings. At temperatures above about<br>
2000°C two effects, disassociation and non-linear specific heat, occur in the fuel-air<br>
products of carbon dioxide and water vapor; the basic products of burning organic fuels.<br><br>
The effect of these two phenomena is to reduce the useful amount of heat that can<br>
produce energy in the engine. Thus as an engine is designed to use higher and higher<br>
compression ratios, the deviation from theoretical efficiency increases so that the actual<br>
efficiency becomes less because of the friction effects noted previously and also due to<br>
the fact that effects of disassociation and variable specific heat counteract some of the<br>
added efficiency gained from the higher compression ratio. Chemical losses are<br>
counteracted by using lean mixtures within the engine; mixtures of fuel and air that<br>
have excessive amounts of air.<br>
4. Pressure drops that occur as air moves into the engine and<br>
exhaust products are expelled from the engine.<br>
[0021] As any gas passes through a tube or other like conduit a pressure<br>
gradient in the gas is required to maintain the velocity of the gas through the conduit.<br>
The same statement applies to gas passing through a port, or entrance, to the conduit<br>
or exit from such passage: A loss of pressure and thus energy is encountered<br>
wherever gas is transported at significant velocity. This energy must be supplied by the<br>
engine and thus creates a loss of efficiency. As noted above in the section on friction<br>
these pressure drops can be considered a form of mechanical friction.<br>
Design Approaches for High Efficiency in Internal Combustion engines<br>
[0022] Balancing the above parameters is not a simple task. The<br>
optimum engine would have negligible friction, high compression ratio, low gas velocity<br>
in all transfer passages and would burn the fuel in a lean mixture at practically all times.<br>
The VCRC engine uses a unique approach to obtain an engine close to this ideal.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0023] The VCRC concept is based on a unique method of optimization<br>
and minimization of the losses in an internal combustion prime mover in creating a<br><br>
prime mover of the highest efficiency. Implementation of the concept details also<br>
results in an internal combustion engine whose combustion inherently creates little<br>
pollutants of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen.<br>
System and Subsystems<br>
[0024] Engines in accordance with the invention accomplish the above<br>
objectives by increasing the compression ratio as the torque demanded of the engine is<br>
decreased throughout the engine's throttling range. As the compression ratio is raised<br>
the engine simultaneously provides for a leaner burning of the fuel ingested into the<br>
engine using a method of separated charge combustion. The combination of higher<br>
compression ratio together with leaner burning raises the efficiency of the engine in<br>
situations during which torque demanded of the engine is less than maximum. Since<br>
practically all applications of prime movers perform the bulk of their duties at these<br>
lower torque values the overall efficiency of systems using the inventive approach is<br>
equally increased.<br>
[0025] This approach has many features but is characterized herein as<br>
Variable Compression Ratio and Charge (VCRC). VCRC engines particularly allow<br>
efficient throttling of two stroke cycle engines to be accomplished. This efficiency is<br>
further enhanced by a subsystem of the invention applicable to two stroke engines.<br>
With a unique arrangement of engine-driven blower and exhaust-driven turbo charger<br>
even further increases of efficiency in two-stroke versions of the VCRC can be<br>
achieved.<br>
[0026] The VCRC engine accomplishes a reduction in both oxides of<br>
nitrogen and unburned hydrocarbons by a method of burning in two phases. First the<br>
fuel is burned in a uniformly mixed fuel-rich environment which includes some EGR.<br>
This mode of burning minimizes the creation of oxides of nitrogen. The initial burning is<br>
immediately followed by a completion of the burning process in an environment in<br>
which<br>
air is present in excessive quantities when compared with that amount needed to<br>
completely burn the fuel.<br>
[0027] Thus in the VCRC internal combustion engine the compression<br>
ratio and the amount of fuel burned (the 'charge') during each firing cycle are<br>
simultaneously varied in response to torque demanded of the engine. A decrease in<br>
torque demand is accompanied by an increase in the engine's compression ratio and a<br>
reduced fuel flow. The relationship of compression ratio and fuel supplied is varied in<br>
such manner as to keep the peak pressure in the engine's combustion process nearly<br>
constant level for all torque demands at a given speed. The relationship of the two<br>
parameters of compression ratio and fuel-air ratio are also varied as speed of the<br>
engine changes so as to raise the combustion peak pressure with an increase in engine<br>
speed.<br>
[0028] Engines in accordance with the invention also include<br>
subsystems that enable the basic engine to perform with increased efficiency and allow<br>
the design to be smaller and lighter than engines now in common usage.<br>
[0029] The engine varies the compression ratio and mixture ratio<br>
simultaneously by arranging the engine so as to have a combustion volume in two<br>
chambers connected by a passageway. The volume of one of these chambers is<br>
varied by a separate piston subsystem mechanism: Burning is initiated in this variable<br>
volume chamber after it has been filled with a uniformly mixed fuel-air mixture. The rise<br>
in pressure and temperature caused by the initial burning forces the fuel air mixture out<br>
of the variable volume to mix with the remaining engine volume in which volume<br>
burning is completed.<br>
[0030] The variable volume combustion chamber is varied by a piston<br>
mechanism arranged to be both reliable and easily controllable. A hydraulic snubber is<br>
used in a preferred embodiment in conjunction with a piston designed to oscillate in a<br>
reciprocating motion each engine cycle. By such design the piston remains reliably<br>
lubricated in its cylinder during operation. The hydraulic snubber provides accurate and<br>
easily implemented control of the piston's motion.<br>
[0031] The VCRC engine's method of combustion offers other<br>
advantages also. By separating the combustion into two phases; an initial combustion<br>
of the bulk of fuel and air in an fuel over-rich environment followed by a completion of<br>
combustion in a high temperature fuel-lean mixture, the problems of detonation are<br>
almost entirely eliminated. Detonation, or knock as it is colloquially called, is an<br>
explosion of the last 5% or less of the bulk fuel-air mixture. An overly rapid rise in<br>
pressure brought about by the initial combustion of the fuel-air mixture creates a<br>
pressure wave that compresses an isolated mixture of fuel and air and the<br>
accompanying rise in temperature of this isolated mixture creates an explosive situation<br>
wherein this mixture spontaneously combusts giving the resultant explosive increase in<br>
pressure and noise. In the VCRC engine the 'end gas', as this isolated fuel air mixture<br>
is called in internal combustion engine engineering, consists only of air. Thus the<br>
concept of octane requirements for the fuel used are moved so far off the engine's<br>
boundary limits as to be of essentially no import. The fuel for a VCRC engine can be<br>
most any mixture of fuel oil, of a low octane number, and gasoline with a higher value.<br>
The need for a high cetane number, necessary for smooth combustion in compression<br>
ignition engines, is equally unimportant.<br>
[0032] The VCRC engine is exemplified here as a two-cycle engine.<br>
The invention is most suitable to the two-stroke configuration but is not limited to this: A<br>
four stroke configuration based on the same principles could also be easily realized.<br>
Some subsystems that are singularly adaptable to a two-cycle engine are also part of<br>
the invention. These include a unique method of supplying air to the engine in a<br>
manner that minimizes the losses associated with air transport.<br>
[0033] The VCRC concept also includes a unique method of<br><br>
combustion to extract energy from a burning fuel-air mixture at higher efficiency than is<br>
now commercially possible in an internal combustion engine This method of burning<br>
has the advantage of chemically combining air and fuel while creating fewer pollutants<br>
than does current engine designs. The VCRC method separates the air and fuel-air<br>
mixture in the engine into two divided volumes. Burning is initiated in the portion of the<br>
air that contains substantially all of the fuel and only part of the air used to support the<br>
combustion in a uniform mixture that is over-rich in excess fuel. The VCRC engine<br>
could be designed to provide a uniform mixture that is excessively lean as well. A<br>
perfect balance between fuel and air, called a stoichiometric ratio is avoided because<br>
this ratio results in an excessive production of nitrogen oxides. The combustion<br>
process is completed by combining the initial burned air and fuel with the remaining air.<br>
The remaining air is present in the combustion chamber in more than sufficient<br>
quantities to oxidize all the fuel in the chamber.<br>
[0034] This method of combustion, used in conjunction with the variable<br>
volume noted above allows lean fuel-air mixtures to be burned at elevated compression<br>
ratios in an engine assembly that has low mechanical friction. This creates internal<br>
engine efficiencies higher than previously thought possible.<br>
Stratified Charge vs. Separated Charge<br>
[0035] Stratified charge has long been used as a method to obtain lean<br>
burning in a spark-ignition engine. There are various ramifications but most have a<br>
single generic embodiment in common. A small volume separated from the main<br>
combustion chamber is supplied with a charge of fuel and air that is rich in fuel. This<br>
charge is fired with a spark and the flame from this ignites the charge in the remainder of<br>
the combustion chamber which latter charge is much leaner. In this manner it is<br>
possible to fire charges as lean as around 50-60% of stoichiometric. Combustion that<br>
takes place only in the small separated volume is often used to support very low torque<br>
values; around 10% of maximum. Between around 10% to around 40% the typical<br>
stratified charge engine is unstable and needs other mechanisms to appropriately<br>
throttle the engine. Stratified charge design also has some problems with efficiency as<br>
well. Near the lean limit of the stratified charge approach there is trouble firing the<br>
charge in the main combustion volume rapidly enough for operation. The slow burning<br>
results in a loss of some of the heat energy of the charge and also results in incomplete<br>
combustion as well.<br>
[0036] The VCRC engine uses what can best be termed as 'separated<br>
charge'. The entire amount of fuel to be burned is contained in a separate variable<br>
volume together with around 60% or less of the air that is to be reduced by the<br>
combustion process. In this manner the difficulties of stratified charge burning are not<br>
present. The bulk of the fuel is burned at rapid velocity in the initial phase of<br>
combustion. Then, when the mixture of unburned fuel and very hot exhaust products<br>
mix with the remaining air the entire amount is at a temperature high enough to<br>
complete the combustion process rapidly.<br>
[0037] A system that could be called 'separated charge' has been<br>
employed in versions of compression-ignition (Diesel) engine. Ricardo shows some<br>
varieties of this. The 'pre-combustion chamber design' and the 'Comet Mark III' can<br>
each be considered to utilize a combustion method that can be characterized as<br>
'separated charge'. In these engine configurations fuel is injected into a volume<br>
separated, by a short gas passage or passages, from the main cylinder volume. In this<br>
volume about 50% of the total air used by the engine is reduced by burning of the<br>
injected fuel in a manner that can be considered conventional compression-ignition<br>
engine spray combustion. Subsequently the hot mixture of fuel and combustion<br>
products are combined with the remaining air in the rest of the cylinder volume. The<br>
process allows up to 90 % of the air to be burned (in the Comet Mark III) at full throttle<br>
showing that the process can be used to burn fuel at any level of leanness as long as all<br>
the fuel and some air are mixed in a fuel-rich burning amalgam in the initial phase of the<br>
burning process.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Construction of the engine<br>
[0055] The construction of an engine in accordance with the invention<br>
can be best understood by referring to Figure 1. A two-stroke engine 51 is fitted with a<br>
combustion chamber 52 of variable volume. Gas within the engine can pass freely<br>
between combustion chamber 52 and the cylinder volume 53 through a gas passage 54.<br>
A spark plug 55 is located in communication with gas passage 54. An injection nozzle<br>
56 is so situated as to spray fuel into the engine in gas passage 54. Injection nozzle 56<br>
is located generally towards the end of gas passage 54 closest to cylinder volume 53<br>
and spark plug 55 is located generally at the other end of passage 54 closest to variable<br>
volume 52. The volume of combustion chamber 52 can be varied with the movement of<br>
an auxiliary piston 57. Auxiliary piston 57 is moved so as to minimize the volume of<br>
variable combustion chamber volume 52 in the absence of any other forces by the<br>
action of a spring 58. Two-stroke engine 51 incorporates a power piston 59 which is<br>
coupled via a connecting rod 60 to a crankshaft 61 in conventional engine fashion. The<br>
crankshaft rotates as shown by the arrow 62 in Figure 1.<br>
[0056] The type of engine illustrated in Figure 1 and the other drawings<br>
is characterized as a loop-scavenged two-stroke engine. Other types of two-stroke<br>
engines would serve equally as well as a basis to use the invention. As noted<br>
previously, four-stroke engine designs could be used alternatively.<br>
[0057] Intake port 109 is connected to a source of air in the VCRC<br>
engine. An exhaust port 110 is connected to reject exhaust products away from the<br>
engine. Exhaust port would be connected to an exhaust manifold in a multi-cylinder<br>
engine and from thence would connect to catalytic converters, a turbine of a turbo-<br>
charger or the like. Both intake and exhaust ports are opened and closed by movement<br>
of power piston 59 in a cylinder 111.<br>
[0058] Referring now to Figure 4 as well as Figure 1, a hydraulic<br>
snubber 64 limits the travel of auxiliary piston 57. Hydraulic snubber 64 is comprised of<br>
a hydraulic piston 65 mounted in a hydraulic regulating cylinder 66, which hydraulic<br>
regulating cylinder is slidably mounted on a fixed hydraulic piston 67. Hydraulic cylinder<br>
66 is moved to the correct position by force supplied by the controller of the engine<br>
acting on a regulating lever 68. Implementation of this snubber function could be<br>
accomplished with a number of mechanisms as will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art but a hydraulic mechanism such as that shown has the advantage of being<br>
reliable and simple to implement. During operation in a single engine cycle auxiliary<br>
piston 57 moves from one end of its travel, wherein volume 52 is nearly zero, to the<br>
other end of its travel, limited by the placement of hydraulic snubber 64. Through this<br>
cyclical motion the interface between auxiliary piston 57 and the cylinder wall enclosing<br>
auxiliary piston remains lubricated during operation. If auxiliary piston 57 were to remain<br>
motionless for a number of cycles the surface of cylinder 117 could lose any lubricant<br>
film on it causing piston 57 to partially or completely stick and become motionless or<br>
erratic in motion.<br>
Control of the system<br>
[0059] Figure 2 illustrates the basic concept of control of various<br>
parameters by the Variable Compression Ratio and Charge or VCRC engine control<br>
linkage system. This drawing shows a schematic representation of the manner in which<br>
the three functions of compression ratio, fuel feed and engine speed are linked in the<br>
VCRC control system. A throttle control wheel 77 is rotated counter-clockwise by the<br>
operator of the engine to increase torque. This rotation actuates a throttle control<br>
linkage 78 to rotate a compression ratio control wheel 79 which regulates the engine<br>
compression ratio through operation of a mechanism such as that shown in Figure 4. As<br>
control wheel 79 is rotated counter-clockwise under the action of throttle control wheel<br>
77 and throttle linkage 78 the compression ratio of the engine is reduced. Control wheel<br>
79 is linked, through a compression ratio linkage rod 80, an auxiliary linkage rod 81, a<br>
speed adjustment linkage rod 82 and a fuel feed linkage rod 83 to a fuel feed control<br>
wheel 84. As control wheel 84 rotates counter-clockwise more fuel is supplied to the<br>
engine at each cycle. The maximum travel of the torque control system is limited by a<br>
throttle stop 92. A specific mechanism for controlling compression ratio and fuel feed is<br>
not indicated in Figure 2. A variety of mechanisms for providing the interrelated<br>
functions may be used by those skilled in the art of engine design. The particular<br>
method of controlling compression ratio in the invention is unique to the present<br>
invention as has been discussed.<br>
[0060] A speed adjustment slider 85 is used to compensate for the<br>
beneficial effects of speed on the load-carrying abilities of journal bearings. As slider 85<br>
moves to the right in Figure 2 the effect is that of lengthening the connection between<br>
compression ratio control wheel 79 and fuel feed control wheel 84 with the result that<br>
more fuel is fed to the cylinder for a given value of compression ratio or, looked at<br>
another way, the torque for a given amount of fuel fed will be higher as speed increases<br>
due to the fact that the compression ratio is higher. If torque demand is held constant,<br>
as speed increases there will be somewhat less fuel supplied for each revolution and the<br>
compression ratio will increase compared to the settings for the same torque at a lower<br>
speed.<br>
[0061] Correcting for speed with this system concept somewhat<br>
counteracts the effects of friction: Friction increases as speed is raised due to the effects<br>
of lubricant viscosity and velocity of gasses passing in and out of the engine as<br>
described previously. The increase in inefficiency due to friction effects is partially offset<br>
by the added thermal efficiency brought about by increased compression ratio and<br>
leaner burning. The higher compression ratio can be better supported by the engine's<br>
bearings because the load capability of journal bearings increases as the shaft rotational<br>
speed is raised.<br>
Operation of the engine<br>
[0062] Referring again to Figure 1 and Figure 4: The VCRC engine at<br>
idle uses only gas passage 54 for a combustion space. In this mode of VCRC operation<br>
slide 65 is moved through operation of control rod 68 so that auxiliary piston 57<br>
nominally cannot move from its position closing combustion chamber 56. In this position<br>
auxiliary piston 57 closes off the volume in combustion chamber 56 so that the<br>
combustion chamber volume is nominally zero. During idle the engine needs a small<br>
amount of torque to run the engine's accessories and any other devices such as air<br>
conditioners and power steering pumps. The amount of fuel needed to support the<br>
energy required is fed in through injector nozzle 56 in a carefully timed manner. By<br>
regulating the time that the fuel flow starts and stops a temporary boundary between fuel<br>
rich and fuel absent air exists in air passage 54 during a compression stroke. The fuel<br>
rich volume will be bounded by auxiliary piston 57 at one end and at a position in air<br>
passage 54 at the other. Spark plug 55 is located at the end of air passage 54 near<br>
auxiliary piston 57 so that the mixture will burn upon firing of the spark plug. During idle<br>
throttle control is only present in the timing of the fuel injection: The compression ratio<br>
during idle mode is substantially constant. Although auxiliary piston 57 is nominally<br>
immobile during idle the compliance of all the parts in the assembly holding auxiliary<br>
piston 57 against gas pressure within the engine's working volume will allow piston 57 to<br>
undergo a small oscillatory motion that will keep the surface between piston 57 and<br>
cylinder 117 lubricated.<br>
[0063] The advantage of keeping variable volume 52 substantially zero<br>
during idle has to do with heat transfer from the burning fuel. Operation of an engine in<br>
transportation duty is typically from 25% and up. At this torque requirement movable<br>
piston 57 will be far enough away from the wall at the end of its travel that the burning<br>
within the variable volume combustion chamber will be substantially unquenched. At<br>
torque requirements of 10-15% of maximum (typical of idle requirements) the piston<br>
head and the wall would be so close together that flame burning within the chamber<br>
would lose much of its heat to the walls since the percentage of heat lost from a<br>
contained gas space is strongly a function of the space between the walls: The loss is<br>
typically proportional to the inverse 2nd or 3rd power of the gap between the surrounding<br>
walls. Thus the design of the VCRC engine allows for torque values in the idle range to<br>
be burned only within transfer passage 54.<br>
[0064] During operation of the engine a pressure is generated in<br>
working volume 63 of the engine; which working volume includes the total of cylinder<br>
volume 53, variable combustion chamber 52 volume, and the volume in gas passage<br>
54. This generated pressure can force auxiliary piston 57 to move, thereby increasing<br>
the volume of variable combustion volume 52. It would also be feasible to move<br>
auxiliary piston 57 with actuators of different kinds such as hydraulic or electrical<br>
mechanisms.<br>
[0065] Lever 68 is connected to the throttle controller for the engine<br>
system. Lever 68 is also connected to the fuel injection system. The connections<br>
amongst the elements of throttle, lever 68 and fuel injection system is not shown in<br>
Figure 1. One possible mechanical schematic that connects compression ratio control,<br>
fuel feed control and speed interaction control is shown in Figure 13. The control<br>
relationship of throttle, compression ratio, speed and fuel feed is described in Figure 2.<br>
A movement of the control towards increased torque demand is accompanied by a<br>
control for lowered compression ratio as well as for increased fuel flow. The simultaneity<br>
of these three commands and the organization within which they are linked provides the<br>
engine that uses the inventive concept with a potential for an efficiency of heat energy<br>
conversion to mechanical work higher than has been reached before in those sizes of<br>
prime mover used for transportation applications. This type of control mechanism could<br>
be reduced to practice using many types of conventional devices.<br>
[0066] The throttle mechanism slides the hydraulic cylinder 66 so as to<br>
allow more or less movement of auxiliary piston 57 when pressure in the working volume<br>
of the engine forces auxiliary piston 57 outward from the engine so as to enlarge<br>
combustion chamber 52. The compression ratio of the engine is thus varied while the<br>
engine is running with the use of this mechanism. At the same time that the<br>
compression ratio of the engine is altered the connection from the throttle to the fuel<br>
injection system operates to alter the amount of fuel injected. The relationship is as<br>
follows: As the compression ratio is raised less fuel is supplied for each firing and vice<br>
versa. In this manner the peak pressure in the engine's cycle is held approximately<br>
constant at any given speed.<br>
[0067] Operation of a two-stroke engine can be broken into four<br>
repeating phases:<br>
a. Scavenge (ref. Figure1.)<br>
b. Compression (ref. Figure 5.)<br>
c. Combustion (ref. Figure 6.)<br>
d. Expansion.(ref. Figure 7.)<br>
[0068] Figure 1 shows the VCRC engine in the scavenge phase.<br>
During this phase both the exhaust and intake ports are opened. In the VCRC engine,<br>
air without fuel is forced through the engine, entering the intake port and continuing out<br>
the exhaust port in the general direction of the arrow 108. This air first expels exhaust<br>
products from the engine and then introduces fresh air into the engine's working volume<br>
63 which includes cylinder volume 53, gas passage 54 and variable volume 52.<br>
Scavenging is not perfect and the scavenging phase ends with an amount of exhaust<br>
products still remaining in working volume 63. The engine shown is generally<br>
characterized as a loop scavenged engine. Air flow through the engine follows a looping<br>
path as indicated by the arrow 108 in Figure 1 as air flow traverses through cylinder<br>
volume 53. Any other type of two-cycle engine porting could equally be used but as the<br>
loop scavenged type is the most common the present discussion will be focused on this<br>
type of engine. Auxiliary piston 57 is in a position to reduce the volume of combustion<br>
chamber 52 to a minimum during the bulk of the scavenge phase. Spring 58 forces<br>
auxiliary piston to this position because the lack of pressure in cylinder volume 53 is at<br>
its lowest point since the exhaust port is open to the atmosphere.<br>
[0069] The scavenge phase lasts typically about 120° of crankshaft<br>
operation. The phase starts, when power piston 59 opens intake port 109, typically<br>
about 60° before power piston 59 is at its bottom dead center (BDC) position or, in other<br>
words, 60° before power piston 59 is at the crankshaft position when power piston 59 is<br>
at the position closest to crankshaft 61 as power piston 59 travels up and down in its<br>
travel. The scavenge phase continues to about 60° after BDC. As can be seen from<br>
study of Figure 1 the opening and closing of exhaust port 60 occurs symmetrically about<br>
BDC in a loop scavenged engine<br>
[0070] Figure 5 shows the VCRC engine in the compression phase.<br>
During this phase power piston 59 compresses air in working volume 63, which includes<br>
cylinder volume 53, transfer port 54 and variable combustion volume 52. The rising<br>
pressure in working volume 63 forces auxiliary piston 57 to move against the force<br>
exerted by spring 58 on auxiliary piston 57. Motion of auxiliary piston 57 can also be<br>
effected by mechanisms driven by hydraulic, electric or other forces as may prove<br>
desirable. This movement of auxiliary piston 57 increases the volume of variable<br>
combustion chamber .52. Air moving from cylinder volume 53 through gas passage 54<br>
to variable combustion chamber 52 passes by injection nozzle 56. During part or all of<br>
the compression phase fuel is injected through injection nozzle 56 into the air stream<br>
proceeding through gas passage 54.<br>
[0071] As the compression phase continues hydraulic snubber port 112<br>
(Figure 4) is covered by hydraulic piston 65. This action prevents further movement of<br>
hydraulic piston 65 and thus movement of auxiliary piston 57. This position of auxiliary<br>
piston 57 determines the minimum volume of working volume 63 of the VCRC engine in<br>
the cycle under discussion and thus the compression ratio of this particular engine<br>
revolution. The compression cycle continues until power piston 59 is at or near top dead<br>
center (TDC) wherein power piston 59 is furthest from crankshaft 61.<br>
[0072] Figure 6 illustrates the combustion or firing phase. A few<br>
degrees before TDC, typically around 30 degrees or less, spark plug 55 fires and this<br>
action ignites the fuel air mixture in the vicinity of spark plug 55. In about the next 10 to<br>
30 degrees of travel by crankshaft 61 all the oxygen in the fuel-air mixture in variable<br>
combustion chamber 52 and gas passage 54 will be consumed. This burning process<br>
greatly expands the fuel air mixture such that the exhaust products of the initial burning<br>
are forced to expand into cylinder volume 53. As is discussed elsewhere in this<br>
disclosure the fuel air mixture involved in the initial burning is often rich in excess fuel.<br>
The total mixture of air and fuel contained in working volume 63 is however lean in fuel<br>
and contains more air and therefore oxygen than is needed to burn the fuel in working<br>
volume 63. In the final time of the firing phase substantially all of the fuel in working<br>
volume is combined with oxygen.<br>
[0073] Figure 7 shows the expansion phase. After power piston 59 has<br>
passed a few degrees after TDC the firing phase becomes the expansion phase as<br>
working volume 63 expands the mixture of exhaust products and air within the engine. It<br>
is during the expansion phase that power is derived from the engine. The expansion<br>
phase of the VCRC engine is like the same phase of other engines in all details. The<br>
phase continues from a few degrees after TDC until power piston 59 opens exhaust port<br>
110. Throughout this phase mechanism 123 operates so as to maintain variable volume<br>
52 at the maximum value that volume 52 experiences during that particular cycle.<br>
[0074] Figure 8 shows the exhaust phase of operation. Power piston<br>
59 travels away from TDC far enough so that exhaust port 110 opens. After this port<br>
opens the exhaust gasses leave the engine working volume as indicated by arrow 161.<br>
Just before power piston 59 opens exhaust port 110 the pressure in working volume 63<br>
is typically from 2 to 6 times the pressure of the surrounding environment. As the<br>
exhaust phase continues through about 10° to 20° of crankshaft travel the pressure in<br>
working volume 63 is reduced to a level near the environment just outside the cylinder<br>
volume. Throughout most of this operation auxiliary piston 57 remains forced against<br>
spring 58 so that variable combustion volume 52 remains open to the volume<br>
determined by position of hydraulic piston 65. At the end of the exhaust phase spring 58<br>
forces auxiliary piston 57 to move towards a minimum volume . This pushes out<br>
exhaust products from volume 52 and readies the engine to enter into the scavenging<br>
phase and repeat the sequence. As noted, movement of auxiliary piston 57 could be<br>
driven by other mechanisms, e.g. hydraulic or electrical actuators.<br>
Four stroke engine operation<br>
[0075] A schematic representation of a four-cycle engine is shown in<br>
Figure 16. Instead of the intake port 109 and exhaust port 110 in the cylinder walls of<br>
the engine their function is replaced by intake valve 157 with intake port 159 and<br>
exhaust valve 156 with exhaust port 158. Operation of the four-stroke VCRC engine<br>
would follow the two-stroke unit exactly as pertains to the compression, combustion and<br>
expansion phases. The scavenge phase of the two-stroke engine is replaced by two<br>
separate strokes of the four-stroke piston; an exhaust stroke as the piston travels from<br>
around bottom dead center (BDC) to close to top dead center (TDC) with exhaust valve<br>
156 open followed by an intake stroke as the piston retreats from TDC to BDC with<br>
intake valve 157 open.<br>
Mechanical schematic of control system<br>
[0076] Figure 13 shows a mechanical schematic for reducing the<br>
control system shown in Figure 2 to practice. It shows how a functioning system could<br>
be built with elementary mechanical structures. The mechanisms shown are auxiliary<br>
piston control mechanism 123 shown in Figure 4, a fuel pump and controller 135 shown<br>
in Figure 14 and a combination gear coupler controller 162 combined with a servo motor<br>
132 to correct for the effects of speed as noted in a previous section. Operation is<br>
described in the following paragraphs.<br>
[0077] Throttle control is effected by moving the input lever 128. This<br>
would normally be connected, in a real system, to the foot throttle in an automobile.<br>
Alternatively this could be driven by a servo motor in a subsystem of a so-called 'control-<br>
by-wire' system.<br>
[0078] Motion of lever 128 directly moves fuel control arm 150 which is<br>
connected to the input lever 136 of fuel pump and fuel controller 135. Movement of<br>
lever 136 moves a vented cylinder 154. Cylinder 154 surrounds a fuel pump piston 137<br>
which is constrained to move in an oscillatory fashion within cylinder 155. Piston 137 is<br>
driven to move back and forth under the influence of cam 138 which is connected to the<br>
crankshaft 61 of engine 51 to rotate as indicated by an arrow 141. Compression spring<br>
140 keeps a piston cam follower 139 in contact with cam 138 to help effect the<br>
aforementioned oscillatory motion of piston 137. Fuel is supplied to the interior of<br>
cylinder 154 through a tube 142 which is connected to a source of fuel which is<br>
pressurized to a pressure adequate to supply fuel at the amount required by the<br>
operation of engine 51.<br>
[0079] As piston 137 moves towards cam 138 fuel is drawn into the<br>
interior of cylinder 154 through cylinder port 143. As piston 137 reverses motion and<br>
moves away from cam 138 fuel is driven back through tube 142 until the movement of<br>
piston 137 covers port 143. Further motion of piston 137 drives fuel out of cylinder 154<br>
through spring-loaded check valve 144, shown in expanded detail in Figure 15. The<br>
spring of valve 144 is of a high enough force such that it requires a pressure<br>
considerably higher that the pressure of the aforementioned pressurized fuel source in<br>
order for the fuel in cylinder 154 to open valve 144 by lifting piston 145 enough to allow<br>
fuel in cylinder 137 to escape though valve 144. After fuel passes through valve 144 it<br>
travels through a tube 162 to the fuel injector nozzle 56 where the fuel is sprayed into<br>
gas passage 54. Cam 138 and the connection of the cam drive connected to engine<br>
crankshaft 61 is designed to effect the injection of fuel into gas passage 54 while air is<br>
being transferred from engine cylinder volume 63 to variable combustion volume 52<br>
during the compression phase of the engine as discussed before.<br>
[0080] The position of cylinder 154 determines how much fuel is<br>
supplied to injector nozzle 56. As throttle lever 128 is moved away from cam 138 fuel<br>
port 143 is moved further from cam 138 as well. This places the position of fuel port 143<br>
closer to the end of the travel away from cam 138 of piston 137, thus limiting the amount<br>
of fuel within cylinder 154 that will be passed though valve 144 before piston 137<br>
reverses movement in its oscillatory travel. In converse fashion, the closer that fuel port<br>
143 is positioned towards cam 138 by lever 128 and fuel control arm 150 the more fuel<br>
will be pumped by the motion of piston 137.<br>
[0081] The moving of lever 128 influences the position of port 112 in<br>
auxiliary piston controller 123 through the action of gear coupler 162. As fuel port 143 is<br>
moved to limit fuel flow the auxiliary piston snubber port 112 (see Figure 4) is moved via<br>
a rack 130, attached to lever 128, a gear 129, in contact with rack 130, a rack 131 and<br>
an auxiliary piston control arm 151. Control arm 151 directly moves regulating lever 68<br>
which is attached to slidable cylinder 64. Cylinder 64 operates in the auxiliary piston<br>
controller 123 in a similar manner as does cylinder 154 in the fuel pump controller 135.<br>
As cylinder 64 moves to position hydraulic port 112 away from auxiliary piston 57 the<br>
movement of piston 57 can travel through a longer path as piston 57 is moved under<br>
action of increasing gas pressure. Due to the nature of the coupling among racks 130<br>
and 131 and gear 129, as cylinder 154 moves to increase fuel flow cylinder 64 moves to<br>
increase the total travel of auxiliary piston 57 during each cycle. Thus as more fuel is<br>
supplied to the engine the travel of auxiliary piston 57 increases and this latter action<br>
increases the volume of variable volume combustion chamber 52, reducing the<br>
compression ratio of the engine.<br>
[0082] The position of the central pivot point 160 of gear129 will change<br>
the relationship between amount of fuel supplied and the compression ratio of the<br>
engine. As pivot point 160 moves away from fuel pump controller 135 a given amount<br>
of fuel supplied to the engine will result in a lower compression ratio. A servo motor 132<br>
suitably designed for the task is positioned as shown in Figure 13. A signal to servo<br>
motor 132 will position pivot point 160 to effect a suitable balance between compression<br>
ratio and fuel supplied. As speed increases pivot point 160 will be positioned closer to<br>
fuel pump controller 135 so as to effect a higher compression ratio for a given amount of<br>
fuel supplied for each engine cycle. This will increase efficiency as speed increases as<br>
noted in the section on control of the system discussed previously.<br>
[0083] The control system of Figure 13 responds to an input from<br><br>
sliding motion induced from a throttle command to throttle lever 128. As this lever is<br>
moved to the right in Figure 13 fuel flow is increased as the sliding motion of lever 128<br>
induces a like motion to movable fuel injection control cylinder 133. This motion moves<br>
the fuel valve port 134 to the right. Such motion allows an increase in the fuel supplied<br>
to the engine during the cycle.<br>
Air supply in two-stroke VCRC engine<br>
[0084] A blower must be provided to any two-cycle engine because this<br>
form of engine, unlike its four-stroke counterpart, does not function directly as an air<br>
pump. As noted above in the discussion of the operation of a four-cycle VCRC engine,<br>
the intake stroke and exhaust stroke function as an air pump to draw air from the<br>
surrounding environment. In low cost versions of two-stroke engines this pumping<br>
function is dealt with by the underside of the piston. Appropriate valving is used to<br>
enable the underside of the power piston to pump air first from the outside environment<br>
to the crankcase under the power piston and then to the working volume. This has the<br>
advantage of simplicity and concomitant low cost but has little else to recommend it.<br>
The air so pumped absorbs heat from the crankcase and the piston and also causes a<br>
high oil consumption to take place.<br>
[0085] There is a fundamental problem with supplying two-stroke<br>
engines with air in an efficient manner. The two-stroke engine needs typically around<br>
40% more air than a four-stroke engine of equivalent power to carry out a proper degree<br>
of scavenging. Since the power needed to pump air through an engine varies as the<br>
third power of the air volume pumped through an engine the limitation for the two-stroke<br>
is severe. Ricardo illustrates that a two-stroke engine at full throttle will be as efficient as<br>
a four stroke engine only at speeds less than about 50% of maximum rotational speed.<br>
Since normal engine practice is to supply the same volume of air at full throttle as at part<br>
throttle this is a severe limitation. The comparison at part throttle would be even worse.<br>
The subsystem discussed below deals with this problem in a manner that severely<br>
reduces the friction associated with air supply.<br>
[0086] The VCRC engine in its simplest two-stroke form, could utilize a<br>
blower driven directly by the crankshaft to provide the air needs of the engine. This<br>
would have the disadvantage discussed above in that the power to force the large<br>
amount of air through the engine would absorb an excess of the engine output A<br>
refinement of the invention that directly addresses and minimizes losses of air and<br>
exhaust gasses passing through passages into and out of the engine is to have the<br>
engine driven blower provide only a portion of the air that the two-stroke engine requires.<br>
The remainder of the air needed to oxidize the fuel burned under high torque demands<br>
would be provided by an exhaust-driven turbo-blower as schematically depicted in<br>
Figure 3. The advantage of this system is that, for most of the usage of the engine, the<br>
engine driven blower supplies only a little more air than is needed to burn the fuel. The<br>
losses associated with pressure drop are thus very small since the energy consumed by<br>
such losses is proportional to the third power, or cube, of the flow rate of the air. Thus,<br>
as the engine is designed to have the shaft-driven blower supply only half or less of the<br>
maximum air flow, the losses at all torque demands below about half the maximum will<br>
be one eighth or less of what a more conventionally designed engine would engender.<br>
Power to drive the turbo-blower is derived from energy in the engine's exhaust that<br>
would be otherwise wasted and thus does not subtract from the output of the engine.<br>
This system would be equally useful in a conventional two-cycle engine because the air<br>
losses in any two stroke create a loss of efficiency. In conjunction with the efficiency<br>
enhancing factors present in the VCRC engine the added effect of the compound blower<br>
system disclosed above results in potential prime mover efficiencies higher than have<br>
heretofore been achieved.<br>
[0087] Figure 3 shows the VCRC compound blower system in<br>
schematic form. Two-stroke engine 51 drives an impeller 96 of a blower 94 through a<br>
shaft 113. Blower 94 takes air in an intake port 95 and drives the air through an intake<br>
passage 118 as indicated by arrow 101. As the air passes through impeller 96 it<br>
undergoes a pressure rise due to the action of impeller 96. After the air leaves blower<br>
94 it passes through a lightly sprung check valve 97 on its way to two stroke engine 51<br>
through an intake manifold 119 connected to intake port 109.<br>
[0088] As the engine is required to provide more torque the exhaust<br>
driven blower 99 is forced to rotate faster because the exhaust has more energy due to<br>
the increased fuei flow and excess exhaust energy resulting from the lessened<br>
compression ratio thus imparting more drive to the turbo impeller 106. As impeller 106<br>
of turbo blower 99 spins faster it will cause more air to be drawn through an intake port<br>
103. The added pressure delivered by blower 99 will overcome the pressure at the<br>
output of blower 94 at some level of exhaust velocity. This over-pressure will force open<br>
a lightly sprung check valve 98 and allow flow from blower 99 to supply the engine as air<br>
flows through turbo driven blower 99 through an intake port 121 as shown by arrow 102.<br>
The same pressure in excess of that delivered by blower 94 will force check valve 97 to<br>
close thereby effectively stopping flow from blower 94. The two modes of operation; one<br>
in which blower 94 supplies all the air needed at low torques and the other in which<br>
blower 99 is the only supply, will overlap during the transition from one mode to the<br>
other. During this transition phase air will be supplied by both blowers in combining to<br>
satisfy the engine's requirements.<br>
[0089] Certain mechanical details are needed to make the system<br>
operative. Exhaust flows from engine 51 to the exhaust driven turbine from exhaust<br>
passage 110 as indicated by arrow 122. After leaving the turbine the exhaust leaves the<br>
system through exhaust manifold 107 to mufflers, catalytic converters, etc. not shown.<br>
Power is transmitted from the turbine 105 to blower 99 by means of a rotating shaft 104.<br>
[0090] The system is made more effective if blowers 105, 99 and 94 are<br>
of the centrifugal type, which is the usual case in automotive turbo-blowers. The<br>
characteristics of this type of blower suit the system shown in Figure 3. When a<br>
centrifugal blower operates against a very high impedance and there is little or no flow<br>
through the blower very little power is needed to turn the impeller of the blower. This is<br>
opposite to the characteristics of a blower of the axial type: The axial type of blower<br>
requires a maximum of power under high head conditions and a minimum power<br>
requirement under high flow-low pressure conditions.<br>
[0091] While the engine is operating at low torque substantially all the<br>
air is supplied by engine driven blower 94. Turbine 105 is being driven by exhaust<br>
gases but blower 99 requires very little power to spin up to full speed. This results in a<br>
turbo-blower that is ready for increased torque demand while blower 99 is not delivering<br>
flow. Because of the low power demand impeller 100 is almost up to speed and ready,<br>
with a small increase in speed, to deliver pressure higher than that of blower 94. Thus<br>
there will be relatively little time delay or 'turbo lag' when an increase in flow is<br>
demanded that will allow the engine to deliver increased torque.<br>
[0092] During periods when torque demand is high and substantially all<br>
the air needed by the engine is supplied by turbo-driven blower 99 check valve 97 is<br>
forced substantially closed by the excess pressure induced in the intake system of the<br>
engine by turbo-driven blower 99. Since centrifugal blowers, as noted above, need very<br>
little power under conditions of low or zero throughput flow the drag on the engine will be<br>
reduced.<br>
[0093] The blower subsystem shown in Figure 3 is made even more<br>
effective due to the characteristics of VCRC engine operation. As discussed previously,<br>
high torque in the VCRC engine is delivered at lowered compression ratios: Exhaust<br>
energy in an internal combustion piston engine is oppositely proportional to the<br>
compression ratio of the engine. Thus the need for high energy in the turbo-blower,<br>
when added torque is demanded, is accompanied by a large increase in exhaust energy<br>
due to the lowered compression ratio in concert with added fuel flow. Ordinary internal<br>
combustion engines using turbo-blowers can suffer so-called 'turbo lag1 or a perceptible<br>
delay in turbo speed increase when an increase in torque demand is needed. This is<br>
because the only energy increase in the conventional engine's exhaust is derived from<br>
an increase in fuel flow.<br>
Throttling a two-cycle spark-ignition engine<br>
[0094] It is well recognized that the two-stroke type engine is potentially<br>
much lighter and potentially more efficient than the more conventional four-stroke<br>
engines. This is because there are two power strokes in the two-stroke engine for each<br>
in the four-stroke variety. Thus the engine does not weigh much more than half as<br>
much as a four-stroke equivalent engine. Since the engine produces twice as much<br>
power while employing the same or fewer parts there is basically less friction in the two-<br>
stroke engine.<br>
[0095] There are two basic problems with the two stroke engine as an<br>
efficient prime mover. The most basic is the throttling problem. Two-stroke spark<br>
engines are most often regulated by restricting the input fuel-air mixture since they are<br>
normally fed a bulk carbureted mixture of gasoline and air. The effect of this restricting<br>
is only to retain exhaust products in the cylinder volume. Thus the efficiency is good at<br>
full throttle, limited only by the air breathing problem discussed before. At part throttle,<br>
however, the efficiency is much worse that the four-stroke equivalent. This is one of the<br>
main factors that has limited the usage of spark-ignition two-stroke engines.<br>
[0096] As may be derived from a consideration of the description of the<br>
VCRC operation the throttling process is carried out in a manner that does not degrade<br>
the efficiency of the engine process in any way. Indeed, the use of a variable volume<br>
that participates in the throttling process and increases compression ratio as a<br>
fundamental part of throttling makes the throttling process one that vastly enhances the<br>
engine efficiency.<br>
Estimate of VCRC efficiency<br>
[0097] The following analysis is given to illustrate the potential of the<br>
VCRC concept. It is quite simplified and many assumptions are made to more easily<br>
show the basic concept. A more precise analysis actually shows an even better<br>
efficiency, particularly at the higher levels of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP)<br>
[0098] Figure 10 shows the relationship of compression ratio of a spark-<br>
ignited engine relative to the amount of fuel supplied to the air in the engine and the<br>
IMEP produced by the engine. Figure 11 shows how the peak pressure created by the<br>
same sort of engine varies with both compression ratio and ratio of fuel supplied. Figure<br>
12 shows how basic indicated efficiency varies with compression ratio and amount of<br>
fuel supplied relative to a stoichiometric ratio. The relationships shown in these three<br>
Figures are all manipulated in the VCRC engine concept to produce the highest<br>
efficiency in a light weight engine.<br>
[0099] Figure 11 shows four datum points: Pertinent data for these<br>
points from Figure 10 and 11 are given in the following table.<br>
[00100] With a frictional MEP equivalent of about 15 psi, which is about the value a<br>
two stroke engine with little drag provided by intake air would experience at a moderate<br>
speed, the torque values of these points can be characterized as; 100%, 76%, 44% and<br>
26% respectively. The indicated efficiencies of the engine at these datum points can be<br>
seen on Figure 12 as 38%, 46% 56% and 60%. Factoring in the frictional pressure as a<br>
mechanical efficiency by:<br>
nm = (IMEP-Pt)/IMEP<br>
where nm = mechanical efficiency<br>
Pt = frictional pressure equivalent<br>
and:<br>
?oa = ?0 X ?m<br>
where Hoa = overall efficiency<br>
n0 = indicated thermal efficiency from Figure 12.<br>
[00101]The efficiencies for each of the datum points is:<br>
Point 124 @100% torque 35%<br>
Point 125 @ 76% torque 41 %<br>
Point 126 @ 44% torque 47%<br><br>
Point 127 @ 26% torque 50%<br>
[00102] The calculations are only approximate but contrast greatly with<br>
an equivalent range of efficiencies for a conventional automobile engine from 28%<br>
efficiency at 100% torque to about 20% efficiency at about 30% of full torque. The<br>
VCRC engine is enough lighter than a conventional four-cycle engine in automobile<br>
service to provide an automobile system weight about 80% to 85% as heavy as a<br>
conventional system using a four-stroke engine. The overall fuel mileage is thus<br>
calculated to be about 3 times as good as the conventional system considering that the<br>
typical torque needed at average speeds is about 30%.<br>
[00103] The VCRC concept can be reduced to mechanical practice with<br>
many different conventional mechanisms employed to provide operation. Figure 1<br>
shows the version that is chosen to describe the system. This and the other drawings<br>
show one method for illustration purposes but many others could be used. The methods<br>
of varying the compression ratio and regulating the fuel flow could readily be chosen<br>
from many kinds of mechanical actuators to optimize various applications. The<br>
mechanical system shown here to describe the operation of the concept is one of myriad<br>
others that could be used.<br>
[00104] A speed correction is also provided as another inventive feature.<br>
The bearings in an internal combustion engine are inevitably of the journal type: The<br>
load that can be supported by such bearings is proportional to their rotational speed. As<br>
the engine rotational speed increases the throttle linkage adjusts so that a given torque<br>
demand will result in a higher compression ratio at increased speed. Less fuel is<br>
supplied to balance out the torque demand and the result is a better fuel economy for a<br>
given level of power. This is discussed in the presentation of Figure 2 previously shown.<br>
Comparison of VCRC efficiency with an existing engine<br>
[00105] Ricardo shows some efficiencies of a compression-ignition<br><br>
(Diesel) engine using a 'Comet Mark III' combustion chamber. The engine uses a<br>
compression ratio of 15 to 1 which is the approximate ratio that a VCRC engine would<br>
have at a torque level about 26% of maximum. It is possible to compare an equivalent<br>
VCRC engine with the Ricardo example. Such comparison is slightly artificial. The<br>
naturally aspirated Ricardo example has a maximum brake MEP of about 125 psi. A<br>
VCRC engine optimally designed would utilize the capabilities of its turbo-blower and<br>
have a maximum brake MEP around 170 psi and would thus be even more efficient in a<br>
properly balanced design.<br>
[00106] The Comet Mark III engine shown as the example in Ricardo has<br>
an efficiency of about 31% at a torque level about 26% of its maximum. The Comet<br>
Mark III engine shown would have a friction level, per Ricardo's discussion, of about 25<br>
psi. A VCRC engine of the same size would have a friction level, per the same data<br>
shown in Ricardo, of about 9.5 psi. The efficiency of the VCRC equivalent engine would<br>
thus be about 43%, a gain of 12 percentage points or a factor of 1.38 greater efficiency.<br>
This ratio would actually be higher than this; about 45% overall efficiency for a factor of<br>
1.45 total better than the Comet Mark III, when the effects of a leaner fuel mixture in the<br>
VCRC is taken into account.<br>
[00107] A turbo charged VCRC engine equivalent would be about only<br>
about 1/3 as heavy as the Comet Mark III compression-ignition engine shown since the<br>
VCRC engine develops twice the power per revolution, being two-stroke instead of four-<br>
stroke, and the maximum brake MEP of an optimized turbocharged VCRC is 170 psi vs.<br>
125 in the Comet Mark III example shown in Ricardo. The difference between 45%<br>
indicated efficiency as calculated for a direct comparison with the Ricardo data and the<br>
50% calculated in the body of this specification arises from the difference in heat<br>
transfer within the engine and the better balance that is attained with the advantages of<br>
the turbo-charged VCRC engine. All compression-ignition engines must have a high<br>
degree of turbulence induced within the engine in order to thoroughly mix the injected<br>
spray with the superheated air during combustion since there is only about 10° of<br>
crankshaft travel to effect such mixing in the compression-ignition engine. This<br>
turbulence results in a large amount of heat transfer between the gases in a<br>
compression-ignition engine and the walls surrounding the combustion chamber and<br>
cylinder. Such heat transfer wastes some of the energy of the burning fuel. Spark-<br>
ignition engines, such as the VCRC engine, have around 100° of crankshaft travel to mix<br>
fuel and air and thus need less turbulence. Consequently spark-ignition engines incur<br>
less wasteful heat transfer. The difference is about 10% of the total delivered efficiency.<br>
[00108] Although various arrangements and modifications have been<br>
discussed above, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto but<br>
encompasses all forms and variations falling within the scope of the appended claims.<br>

which method includes the steps of:<br>
a. directing all of the air supplied to said engine into both the<br>
main cylinder volume (63) and into said auxiliary volume;<br>
b. directing all of the fuel into said auxiliary volume;<br>
c. initiating combustion of said fuel and air in said main cylinder<br>
volume;<br>
d. completing combustion of said fuel and air in said main<br>
cylinder volume, and<br>
e. changing the volume of said auxiliary cylinder to vary the<br>
compression ratio of said cylinder/piston combination;<br>
characterized in that<br>
f. said engine is a spark ignited internal combustion engine; and<br>
g. said fuel is directed into said auxiliary volume by mixing with<br>
air flowing in said conduit (54) to said auxiliary volume during<br>
part or all of the compression phase of said engine forming<br>
therein a combustible mixture of fuel and air substantially<br>
uniformly mixed prior to said initiation of combustion.<br>
h. said fuel is injected substantially only into said conduit (54) into<br>
