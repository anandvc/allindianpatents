//        Methods of Making Chromatography Columns<br>
[0057J The present invention is also directed to methods of making chromatography columns having at least one fiber-reinforced layer. In one exemplary method, the method of making a chromatography column comprises forming a first sleeve comprising an inert material, and surrounding an outer surface of the first sleeve with a fiber-reinforced layer. Such a process may be described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
[0058J As shown in FIG. 4, exemplary chromatography column 40 comprises a preformed first sleeve 31 comprising an inert material, such as aluminum, having an inner surface 44 and an outer sleeve surface 43. An exemplary fiber-reinforced tape (e.g., tape of unidirectional fibers) or prepreg 45 may be wound onto outer sleeve surface 43 of first sleeve 41. Exemplary fiber-reinforced tape or prepreg 45 may be wound onto outer sleeve surface 43 to form a fiber-reinforced resin layer 42 having a desired layer thickness so as to provide a desired degree of structural strength to exemplary chromatography column 40. Desirably, the outer wall surface of the resulting tubular wall structure is a continuous surface that extends around an outer periphery of the tubular wall structure (as shown in exemplary chromatography column JO shown in FIG. 1 and exemplary chromatography column 40 shown in FIG. 4).<br>
[0059J In one exemplary embodiment, preformed first sleeve 41 comprises a stainless steel sleeve, and a surface of fiber-reinforced layer 42 is in direct contact with outer sleeve surface 43. In this exemplary embodiment, an outer portion of preformed first sleeve 41 forms an inner wall surface of exemplary chromatography column 40.<br>
f0060] Although not shown in FIG. 4, preformed first sleeve 41 could further comprise flange portions on opposite ends of preformed first sleeve 41 (such as flanges 16 and 17 of exemplary chromatography column 10 shown in FIG. 1) with the flange portions forming the first end and second end of the resulting tubular wall structure.<br>
14<br><br>
[0061] In an alternative embodiment, the method of making a chromatography column may comprise forming a fiber-reinforced layer over a temporary mandrel or sleeve, and subsequently removing the temporary mandrel or sleeve to provide a fiber-reinforced layer. In this embodiment, additional layers may be combined with the fiber-reinforced layer by a variety of process steps. Suitable process steps may include, but are not limited to, chemical or vapor deposition of a material onto a surface of the fiber-reinforced layer; any solution coating step for depositing a material onto a surface of the fiber-reinforced layer; and forming an inner or outer sleeve in a separate step and subsequently combining the inner or outer sleeve with the fiber-reinforced layer.<br>
[0062] In yet a further alternative embodiment, the method of making a chromatography column may comprise forming a fiber-reinforced layer via a molding step or other thermoforming step. The fiber-reinforced layer may be formed separately in a molding step or formed simultaneously with one or more additional layers during a single molding step.<br>
[0063] Other methods of forming the tubular wall structure of the chromatography columns of the present invention may comprise one or more method steps for forming fiber-reinforced composite materials as disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,936,861; 5,468,358; 4,655,384; 4,305,449; 5,589,115; 5,436,042; 5,009,823; 4,927,345; and 4,357,305, the subject matter of all of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
[0064] In any of the above-described methods of making a chromatography column, the methods may include any number of additional steps. Suitable additional stqps may include, but are not limited to, subjecting the fiber-reinforced layer and any additional layers to an autofrettage process step; testing the pressure capacity of the resulting chromatography column; surface treating or finishing the inner wall surface of the column to provide a desired surface smoothness thereon; sealing one end of the column; at least partially filling a column cavity of the column with a rigid support material, such as any of the above-described rigid support materials; at least partially filling the column cavity of the column with a first buffer solution to encapsulate the rigid support material; inserting a piston, spring and/or threaded rod into the chromatography column to engage, and/or compress and/or retain the rigid support material within a desired area of the column; and sealing the opposite end of the column. The chromatography column may be stored for future use or may be subsequently connected to an apparatus comprising one or more apparatus components.<br>
15<br><br>
///.      Methods of Using Chromatography Columns<br>
[0365J The present invention is further directed to methods of using chromatography columns having at least one fiber-reinforced resin layer. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the method of using a chromatography column comprises a method of analyzing a test sample that potentially contains at least one analyte. In this exemplary method, the method comprises the step of introducing a test sample into a chromatography column containing a rigid support media, wherein the chromatography column comprises a tubular wall structure comprising a fiber-reinforced resin layer as described above. The rigid support media may comprise a plurality of inorganic particles such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,802,966, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other rigid support materials may comprise organic particles, inorganic or organic monoliths or membranes. [0066J The method of analyzing a test sample may further comprise one or more of the following steps; allowing the test sample to come into contact with the rigid support; rinsing the rigid support to wash away any test sample components other than the one or more analytes; introducing an eluent solution into the column so that the eluent solution comes into contact with the one or more analytes bound to the rigid support; and allowing the eluent solution to remain in contact with the rigid support for a period of time so as to form an eluent sample. Typically, the eluent solution remains in contact with the rigid support for a period of time ranging from about 5 minutes to about 15 minutes.<br>
[0067] The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended claims,<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of a Chromatography Column<br>
[0068] A sleeve comprising type 316 stainless steel was formed during a die casting process. The resulting sleeve had an overall length of 1.0 m, a circular cross-sectional configuration with an inner diameter of 25 mm, a sleeve wall thickness of 2.0 mm, and flange$ on each end of the sleeve. Each flange extended outward from the sleeve, had a circular configuration with an outer diameter of 100<br>
16<br><br>
mm, and had a flange -wall thickness of 71 mm. The sleeve was positioned on a winding apparatus capable of rotating the sleeve along an axis extending along a length of the sleeve through a central portion of the aluminum sleeve, [0069] A carbon fiber tape (designated P3052S-10 from Toray Industries, Inc. (Tokyo, JP)) comprising T700SC carbon fiber tow (67 wt%) embedded within an epoxy resin system (33 wt%) was wound directly onto the aluminum sleeve so as to cover an outer surface of the aluminum sleeve extending from a first flange to a second flange. The carbon fiber tape was wound onto the aluminum sleeve so as to form a fiber-reinforced resin layer having a thickness of about 4.0 mm. The composite sleeve was then heat cured in an oven at about 190°C. [0070) The resulting column had an overall wall thickness of 6.0 mm, and a pressure capacity of about 5000 psig.<br>
(0071] While the specification has been described in detail with respect to specific embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing, may readily conceive of alterations to, variations of, and equivalents to these embodiments. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be assessed as that of the appended claims and any equivalents thereto.<br>
