Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to phenol derivatives and method of use thereof.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to novel phenol derivatives represented by the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein the carbon atom marked with (S) represents a carbon atom in S configuration; Z represents the group represented by the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the carbon atom marked with (i?) represents a carbon atom in R  configuration, and method of use thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
The optically active phenol derivative, more particularly, the phenol derivative (chemical name: (1R, 2S)-2-amino-l-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-ol) represented by the formula:<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 (wherein the carbon atoms marked with (R) and (S) have the same meanings as defined above) which is watched as an intermediate of medicaments and described to be useful in manufacturing, for example, 2-aminopropanol derivatives useful as agents for prevention or treatment of obesity, hyperglycemia or a disease caused by intestinal tract hypermotility (see the following literature 1), aminoethylphenoxyacetic acid derivatives useful as agents for pain remission and calculi removal promotion in urinary lithiasis (see the following literature 2), and phenoxyacetic acid derivatives useful as agents for prevention or treatment of pollakiuria, urinary incontinence, depression, biliary calculi or a diseases caused by hypermotility of biliary tract (see the following literature 3) .<br>
Thus far, as a production method of the optically active compound represented by the above formula (A) , a method to obtain the compound represented by the above formula (A) by optical resolution with (-) -D-tartaric acid from a mixture of enantiomeric isomers represented by a formula:<br>
(Figure Remove)	<br>
(wherein the relative configuration of the amino group and the hydroxy group is erythro configuration) has been reported (see the following literature 4).<br>
However, in the above method to produce the phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A), the mixture<br>
of the enanthiomeric isomers represented by the above formula (B) has to be optically resolved by using unnatural (-)-D-tataric acid unavailable easily, and in addition, the yield of the obtained phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) is rather low of about 19%. Furthermore, it was an extremely wasteful method in that, for example, the most of the produced phenol derivative represented by the above formula (B) was wasted, because in the optical resolution of the mixture of enantiomeric isomers represented by the above formula (B) , the other isomer of a desired isomer could not be recycled.<br>
As mentioned above, the method that has been ever reported to produce the optically active phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) has many problems, and is not a necessarily satisfactory production method in manufacture on an industrial scale and from the viewpoint of environmental aspects. Therefore, more effective and efficient method to produce the optically active phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) has been desired.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present inventors have studied earnestly to find a suitable method for manufacturing the optically active phenol derivative useful as a production intermediate of medicaments, represented by the above formula (A), and as a result, found a method to produce the compound represented by the above formula (A) more easily, effectively, and efficiently than before.  The present invention has been completed based on the knowledge obtained in the production process.<br>
The present invention is to provide a novel intermediate suitable for manufacture of, for example, an optically active phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) that is useful as a production intermediate for various medicaments and a method of use thereof.<br>
That is, it was found that an optically active phenol derivative found newly by the present inventors, represented by the formula:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 (wherein the carbon atom marked with (S) has the same meaning as defined above), can be stereoselectively reduced into a highly pure phenol derivative represented by the formula:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 (wherein the carbon atoms marked with (R) and (S) have the same meanings as defined above) without using any special asymmetric catalyst unavailable easily, and furthermore, by treating the obtained phenol derivative represented by the above formula (Ib) with an amine such as methylamine or hydrazine, without conducting optical resolution, the highly pure optically active phenol derivative (A) can be produced more easily, effectively and efficiently than before.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by the above formula (la) and (Ib) can be prepared, for example, in a manner described in Scheme 1.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 (wherein the carbon atoms marked with (R) and (S) have the same meanings as defined above.) Process 1<br>
A phenol derivative (la) can be obtained by subjecting a reactive functional derivative typified by an acid halide of (S)-2-phthalimidopropionic acid (III) to reaction with anisole in a presence of a Lewis acid in an organic solvent such as chlorobenzene, dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane usually at 40°C to 80°C for 3 to 24 hours. As a reactive functional derivative, it is preferable to use 0.5 to 1.5 equivalent of (S) -2-phthalimidopropionyl chloride. As a Lewis acid, it is preferable to use 3.5 to 5.0 equivalent of aluminum chloride. Process 2<br>
A compound (Ib) can be obtained by subjecting the obtained compound (la) to catalytic hydrogenation in a presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium-carbon powder or palladium hydroxide or a nickel catalyst such as Raney nickel in an organic solvent such as W, N-dimethylformamide, ethanol or dioxane<br>
usually at room temperature to reflux temperature of the solvent at 1 to 10 atm for 1 to 48 hours.<br>
Optically active 2-phthalimidopropionic acid represented by the above formula (III) can be prepared from a cheap, easily available and natural (L)-alanine in a publicly known method (see the following literature 5).<br>
From novel compounds (la) and (Ib) of the present invention, the optically active phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) useful as a production intermediate of medicaments can be prepared in the following method described in Scheme 2:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
 (wherein the carbon atoms marked with (R) and (S) have the same meanings as defined above.)<br>
The compound (A) useful as a production intermediate of medicaments can be obtained by removing the phthaloyl group of the phenol derivative (Ib), for example, to treatment with a primary amine such as methylamine, hydrazine anhydrate or a hydrate thereof in an organic solvent such as ethanol, or water, or a mixed solvent thereof usually at 20°C to 90°C usually for 1 to 48 hours. As a primary amine, it is preferable to use 3 to 20 equivalent of methylamine.<br>
For example, the phenol derivative represented by the above formula (A) obtained in Scheme 2 can be derived into a compound useful as a pharmaceutical drug in manners described in the above literatures 1 to 3.<br>

To a mixture of alminium chloride (16.7 g) and chlorobenzene (150 mL) , anisole (18.6 mL) was added and this mixture was stirred at 60 - 65 °C (internal temperature). To this mixture, the solution of (S)-2-phthalimidopropionyl chloride, mentioned above, in chlorobenzene (30 mL) was added dropwise over 20 minutes, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 60 - 65 °C (internal temperature) for 12 hours. After the temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to 70 - 75 °C (internal temperature), aluminium chloride (45.6 g) was added to this mixture, and then stirred at same temperature for 3 hours.  The mixture was cooled to 50 °C (internal temperature) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) was added dropwise.  The resulting mixture was added to a mixture of water (250 g) , ethanol (25 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL) at 30-45 °C (internal temperature) , and stirred at same temperature for 30 minutes. Organic layer was separated from the reaction mixture, the organic layer was washed with brine, sodium bicarbonate solution, brine, 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid and brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
