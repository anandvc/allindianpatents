				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  an  apparatus  for sieving  a  particulate  material  into  selected  isize fractions.<br>
The  present  invention  relates  particularly, although  by  no  means  exclusively,   to  an  apparatus  for sieving  diamonds  into  selected  size  fractions..<br>
The  conventional  apparatus  for  sieving  diamonds into  selected  size   fractions   comprises  an  assembly  of vibrating  screens  that  are  arranged  in  a  stack  with  the uppermost  screen  having  the  largest  screen  size  and successive  screens  having  progressively  finer  screen  sizes.<br>
The  conventional  apparatus  is  operated  on  a  batch basis  and,   as  a  consequence,   the  apparatus  generally  is  not compatible  with  upstream  and  downstream  diamond  processing steps  which  are  usually  operated  on  a  continuous  basis. Another  disadvantage  of  the  conventional  apparatus  is  that the  screens  block  readily  due  to  diamonds  becoming  lodged in  holes  in  the  screens   ("pegged").    As  a  consequence, pegged  diamonds  must  be  removed  from  the  screen  holes periodically  to  maintain  optimum  performance  of  the screens,     in  addition  to  this  being  a  time-consuming  and labour  intensive  exercise,   there  is  generally  a  degradation of  product  caused  by  diamonds  being  broken  during  the de-pegging  operation.     Other  disadvantages  of  the conventional  apparatus  are  high noise  and  dust  levels.<br>
An  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to  provide an  apparatus  for  sieving  diamonds  into  selected  size fractions  which  alleviates  the  disadvantages  of  the<br>
conventional apparatus described in the preceding paragraph.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for sieving a particulate material into selected size fractions comprising:<br>
(a)	a screen for separating the particulate material into an undersize fraction and an oversize fraction the screen having an inlet end for introducing particulate material to the screen and an outlet end for discharging the oversize fraction;<br>
(b)	a means for receiving the undersize fraction from the screen; characterized by<br>
(c)	a rotating drive means for rotating or oscillating the screen about an axis of the screen; and<br>
(d)	an additional twin phase drive means coupled to the screen for driving the screen in two directions, in a first direction along said axis of the screen for imparting or generally horizontal motion and in a second direction orthogonal thereto for imparting a generally vertical motion<br>
The applicant has found that the motion of particulate material in the screen that is caused by the twin phase drive means substantially increases the path length of the particulate material in the screen and, thereby, greatly increases the opportunity for particles to pass through the screen.<br>
In addition, the applicant has found that the overall motion of the particulate material in the screen caused by the combined effect of the twin phase drive means and the rotating/oscillating drive means increases the overall movement of particles in the screen and this minimises      pegging      of     particulate      material      in      the      screen.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  twin  phase  drive  means be  coupled  to  the  screen  for  driving  the  screen  in  two orthogonal  directions.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  twin  phase  drive  means<br>
be  coupled  to  the  screen  for  driving  the  screen  in  a vertical  direction  and  an  axial  direction  of  the  screen  for r. imparting  vertical  and  axial  motion  to  the  particulate material  as  the  particulate  material  moves  from  the  inlet end  toward  the  outlet  end.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  screen  be  supported  with the  axis  of  the  screen  horizontal.<br>
with  such  an  arrangement,   it  is  preferred  that the  twin-phase  drive  means  be  coupled  to  the  screen  for driving  the  screen  vertically  and  horizontally  for imparting  vertical  and  horizontal  motion  to  the  particulate material.<br>
The  horizontal  motion  of  the  particulate  material which  results  from  the  drive  applied  to  the  screen  may  be in  a  forward  direction  only,   i.e.   in  an  axial  direction towards  the  outlet:  end  of  the  screen,   or  it  may  be  such that  there  are  components  of  forward  and  reverse  motion.<br>
It  is  noted  that  for  each  particle  at  various times  there  may  be  no  imparted  horizontal  motion,   with  the only  motion  of  the   particles  being  vertical  and rotational/oscillatory.<br>
it  is  preferred  that  the  rotating/oscillating drive  means  and  the  twin  phase  drive  means  be  adapted  to impart  a  tumbling  motion  to  the  particulate  material  so that   the  orientation  of  the  particulate  material  with respect  to  the  screen  holes  changes  continually  as  the particulate  material  travals   through OR  along  the  scr een  to<br>
increase  the  probability  of  a  particle  passing  through  the screen.<br>
The  apparatus  may  be  operated  on  a  continuous basis.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  screen  be  cylindrical.<br>
The  screen may  comprise  a  series  of  cylindrical sections  having  different  screen  sizes.<br>
Alternatively,   the  screen  may  be  channel-shaped. With  such  an  arrangement,   the  screen walls  may  be  curved  or straight  sections.<br>
It   is  preferred  that  the  twin  phase  drive  means comprise  a  first  drive  means  for  reciprocatingr  the  screen in  a  first  direction  and  a  second  drive  means  for reciprocating  the  screen  in  a  second  direction.<br>
It  is  preferred  particularly  that firm<br>
direction be  vertical  and  the  second  direction  axial<br>
direction.<br>
it  is  preferred more  particularly  that  the  second direction  be  horizontal.<br>
It is preferred that the apparatus comprise a control means for independently controlling the rate of feed  of  particulate  material  to  the  screen.<br>
It   is  preferred  that  the  apparatus  further comprises  a  control  means  for  selectively  controlling  one or  more  of  the  frequency,   amplitude,   and  phase  of  each  of the  first  and  second  drive  means.<br>
It  is  preferred  particularly  that  the.  control<br><br>
means  be  adapted  to  control  one  or  more  of  the  frequency, amplitude,   and  phase  of  one  of  the  drive  means independently  of  the  other  drive  means.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  apparatus  further comprises  a  control  means  for  selectively  controlling  the rate  of  rotation/oscillation  of  the  rotating/oscillating drive  means.<br>
It  is  preferred  that  the  apparatus  further comprises  a  de-pegging  means  positioned  externally  of  the screen.<br>
The  de-pegging  means  may  he  any  suitable  means.<br>
It  is  particularly preferred  that  the, de-pegging means  be  adapted  to  change  the  orientation  of  pegged particulate  material  so  that  the  pegged  particles  are subsequently  released  under  the  influence  of  gravity.<br>
Typically,   the  de-pegging  means  comprises  a  brush and  a  means  to  reciprocate  the  brush  axially  to  move  the brush  across  the  outer  surface  of  the  screen.<br>
The  present  invention  is  described  further  by  a way  of  example  with  reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings in  which:<br>
Figure  1   is  a  perspective  view  of  a  preferred embodiment  of  an  apparatus  in  accordance  with  the  present invention;<br>
Figure  2   is  a  perspective  view  from  the  front  of the  main  components  of  the  apparatus  shown  in  Figure  1  with the  safety  cover  removed  and  one  of  the  screen  in  a  raised position  for  clarity;<br>
Figure  3  is  a  top  plan  view  of  the  main components  of  the  apparatus  as  shown  in  Figure  2  with  both screens  in  operative  positions;<br>
Figure  4  is  a  side  elevation  of  the  main<br>
components  of  the  apparatus  as  shown  in  Figure  3;<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view from the rear of the  main  components  of  the  apparatus  shown  in  Figure  3;   and<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view from the rear of selected main components of the apparatus shown in Figure 3.<br>
The  apparatus  shown  in  Figures  1  to  6  is  suited particularly  for  sorting  diamonds  into  selected  size fractions  and  is  described  in  this  context,     However,   it  is noted  that  the  apparatus  of  the  present  invention  is  not limited  to  this  application  and  may  be  used  to  sort  any suitable  particulate  material.<br>
The  apparatus  shown  in  Figures  1  to  6  includes two  separate  identical  screen  assemblies  and  in  order  to simplify  the  following  description  of  the  apparatus  there is  a  reference  only  to  one  of  these  assemblies.<br>
With  reference  to  the  Figures,   the  apparatus comprises  a  horizontally  disposed  cylindrical  screen  3 which  has  an  inlet  end  5  for  receiving  diamonds  and  an outlet  end  7  for  discharging  over-sized  diamonds  into  an oversize  product  bin  or  hopper  8.      In  relation  to   the outlet  end  7  it  is  noted  that  the  oversized  diamonds  are discharged  through  a  series  of  relatively  large  holes  10   in the  screen  3  at  spaced  intervals  around  the  circumference of  the  screen  3  at  the  outlet  end  7  of  the  screen  3.<br>
The  apparatus  further  comprises  a  feed  hopper  9<br>
for  receiving  diamonds  on  a  batch  or  a  continuous  basis  and a  bowl  feeder  11  positioned  below the  feed  hopper  9  for accurately  transferring  diamonds  from  the  feed  hopper  9 into  the  inlet  end  5  of  the  screen  3.<br>
The  apparatus  further  comprises  a  chute  13 positioned  beneath  the  screen  3  for  receiving  undersized diamonds  that  pass  through  the  screen  3  and  for transferring  the  diamonds  to  an  undersized  bin  2.<br>
In  a  particularly  advantageous  embodiment   (not shown),  the  screen  3  comprises  a  series  of  cylindrical sections  of  different  screen  sizes  to  screen  diamonds   into different  size  fractions  as  the  diamonds  move  along  the length  of  the  screen  3  from  the  inlet  end  5  towards  the outlet  end  7.     In  this  embodiment,   a  separate  chute  is provided  for  each  screen  section  to  receive  each  size fraction  of  diamonds.<br>
With  further  reference  to  the  Figures,   the  screen 3  is  supported  for  rotation  about  the  central  elongate  axis of  the  screen  3.     In  this  connection,   the  apparatus  further comprises  a  drive  means  26  which  comprises  an  electric motor  that  transfers  drive  via  a  belt  41  to  rotate  the screen  3  about  the  central  axis.<br>
Furthermore,   the  apparatus  comprises;:<br>
(a)       a  twin-phase  drive  assembly,   generally<br>
identified  by  the  numeral  15,   comprising  a first  drive  means  27   for  reciprocating  the screen  3  vertically  and  a  second  drive means  28  for  reciprocating  the  screen  3 horizontally  for   imparting'  vertical   and horizontal  motion,   respectively,   to diamonds  as   the  diamonds  move   towards  the outlet  end  7   of  the  screen  3;   and<br>
(b)       a  control  means   (not  shown)   for  selectively<br>
controlling  one  or  more  of  the  frequency,<br>
amplitude,   and  phase  of  each  of  the  first<br>
and  the  second  drive  means  27,   28  as  may  be<br>
required  for  optimum  operation  of  the<br>
apparatus.      '	.<br>
The  first  and  the  second  drive  means  27,   28  are coupled  to  the  screen  3  by  means  of  a  series  of  aspiring  20, and  the  drive  is  transferred  to  the  screen  3  via  the springs  29.<br>
Furthermore,   the  assembly  of  the  screen  3  and  the first  and  second  drive  means  27,   28/  are  mounted  via vibration  isolating  blocks  51  to  a  support  framework  61.<br>
It  is  noted  that  the  optimum  operation  of  the apparatus  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors   including  but not  limited  to  the  weight  of  the  diamonds  being  processed and  the  size  distribution  of  the  diamonds.     In  some situations,   the  optimum  operation  may  be  achieved  by controlling  the  first  and  the  second  drive  means  27,   28  so that  the  diamonds  move  upwardly  and  downwardly  and  in  a forward  axial  direction  toward  the  outlet  end  7. Alternatively,   the  optimum  operation  may  be  achieved  by causing  the  diamonds  to  move  upwardly  and  downwardly  and  in the  forward  and  reverse  axial  directions,   with  net  forward axial  movement.     In  addition,   in  either  case,   the  optimum operation  may  be  achieved  by  controlling  the  first  and  the second  drive  means  27,   28  so  that  at  given  points   in  time the  diamonds  move  upwardly  and  downwardly  only  with  no  net forward  or  reverse  axial  motion.<br>
It   is  also  noted  that  in  addition  to  the  vertical motion  of  the  diamonds',   the  combined  effect  of  the  rotary drive  means  26  and  the  twin  phase  drive  means  15  in  to cause  the  diamonds  to  move  with  a  tumbling  motion.<br>
The  apparatus  further  comprises  a  diamond  de-pegging  assembly,   generally  identified  by  the  numeral  21, for  de-pegging  diamonds  from  the  screen  3..     The  assembly  .21 comprises  a  brush  23  and  a  drive  means  25   in  the  form  of  a double-acting  cylinder  for  reciprocating  the  brush  23 axially  against  the  outer  surface  of  the  screen  3.'     The brush  23  causes  a  change  of  the  orientation  of  pegged diamonds  which  is  sufficient  to  release  the  pegged  diamonds under  the  influence  of  gravity  as  the  screen  3  rotates about  the  central  axis.<br>
The  applicant  has  found  that  the  use  of  the apparatus  described  above,   particularly  as  a  consequence  of the  provision  of  a  twin  phase  drive  means  15,   substantially reduces  the  time  required  to  screen  diamonds  into  selected<br>
size  fractions  when  compared  with  the  conventional<br>
* vibrating  screens.<br>
in  addition,   as   indicated  previously,   the applicant  has  found  that  the  increased  path  length  of diamonds   in  the  screen  that   is  caused  by  the  motion  of  the screen  3  as  a  consequence  of  the  twin phase  drive  means  15 increases  the  probability  of  diamonds  being  exposed  to  a hole   in  the  screen  3   and,   therefore,   the  apparatus   screens diamonds  in  an  efficient  and  effective  manner.<br>
Furthermore,   as  indicated  previously,   the apparatus  can  be  operated  on  a  continuous  basis  and  such operation  is  compatible  with  typical  upstream  and downstream  diamond  processing  operations.<br>
In  addition,   the  applicant  has  found  that  the apparatus  described  above  enables  more  accurate  sieving  of diamonds  than  is  possible  with  the  conventional  vibrating screens.<br>
Many  modifications  may  be  made  to  the  preferred<br>
embodiment  of  the  apparatus  of  the  present  invention described  above  without  departing  from  the  spirit  and  scope of  the  present  invention.<br>
By  way  of  example,  whilst  the  preferred<br>
embodiment  comprises  a  cylindrical  screen  3  it  is  noted that  the  present  invention  is  not  so  limited  and  the  screen  may  be  of  any  suitable  configuration.  By way  of  particular example,   the  screen  3  may  be  an  open-topped  channel-shaped member  which  is  supported  to  oscillate  about  a  central axis.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
