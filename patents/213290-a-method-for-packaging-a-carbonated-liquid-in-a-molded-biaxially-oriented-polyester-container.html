A METHOD FOR PACKAGING A CARBONATED LIQUID IN A MOLDED<br>
BIAXIALLY ORIENTED POLYESTER CONTAINERAND A WATER-BORNE<br>
GAS BARRIER COATING COMPOSITION<br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, USA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
000/49072<br><br>
PCT/US00/03802<br><br>
TITLE GAS BARRIER COATING SYSTEM FOR POLYMERIC FILMS AND RIGID CONTAINERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved water-borne gas barrier coaling composition for polymeric films and rigid, i.e., shaped, containers, and, more particularly, to an improved two-layer coating system which includes a laminar layer mineral in the gas barrier layer and is particularly well suit for spray application. The invention further relates to coated polymeric substrates which exhibit substantially increased gas barrier performance over un-coated polymeric substrates as well as over those which have been coated with any other known gas barrier system.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,700,560 describes a resin composition, and films coated therewith, consisting of a high-hydrogen bonding resin, such as polyvinyl alcohol, and a non-film-forming inorganic laminar compound which provides improved gas barrier properties of the resulting film by increasing the aspect ratio of the inorganic laminar compound.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,571,614 describes a coated polymeric film in which a coaling layer is formed from a composition comprising a layer mineral and a cross-linking agent. The coated film additionally comprises a primer layer formed from a copolymer of ethylene with a vinyl monomer which is applied to the film substrate prior to coating with the layer mineral coating.<br>
There is a need for a reliable, economical and environmentally acceptable, i.e.. recyclable, coating system for injection stretch blow molded PET bottles, in particular, which will dramatically improve barrier performance such that the bottles can be used for carbonated soft drinks and beer in 12 oz. (33 ml) sizes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention resides in the discovery that it is possible to substantially increase, e.g., up to 20 or even 30 times or more, the gas barrier performance of conventional rigid, i.e., shaped or molded, plastic containers and films by applying to at least one surface of the container or the film a unique water-borne composition to form a first coating layer. The water-borne composition comprises a water-soluble or water dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, wherein the organic binder includes from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof. The first coating layer can be uncross-linked, partially cross-linked or fully cross-linked.<br><br>
W000/49072	PCT/U800/03802<br>
Spray appapplication of the coating composition produces a generally uniform first coating layer having a dry thickness of up to 20 microns, although in practice excellent barrir properties have been observed with relatively thin coating layers in the range of only 3 to 4 microns in thickness.  The mineral platelets become oriented within the organic binder portion of the dry coating layer in a generaly parallel three-dimensional and overlapping spaced relationship- Depending on the application, a shaped plastic container having a first coating layer for gas barrier properties, for example, can also include a second substantially clear coating layer adhered to the first coating layer. The second coating layer comprises a curable 10      composition comprising (a) a binder component in (b) an organic solvent. Thus, according to one aspect, the present invention is a polymeric container for foods and beverages which composes:<br>
(A)	a polymeric substrate shaped to define a container for a food or beverage:<br>
(B)	a first coating layer adhered to at least one surface of the polymeric substrate and capable of retarding the transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the substrate, said first coating laying comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binder and from 10% up to less than 90% by weight based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar<br>
20      mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified<br>
montmorollonite and mixtures thereof. Most conventional rigid or shaped polymeric containers which have a first coating layer on at least one surface thereof according to the invention will exhibit, based on test samples cut from bottle walls, an Oxygen Permeability Value of about 0.7 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm.<br>
25      although the Oxygen Permeability Value can be as low as 0.07 cc<br>
mil/100 in2/day/atm. In some cases Oxygen Permeability Values lower than 0.03 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm have been observed for wall and/or film test samples. Total bottle permeability (as measured in cc/pack/day on a Mocon Oxtran 2/60 or 2/20 instrument) will exhibit an improvement in Oxygen Permability Value of up to 35 times vs. uncoated control bottles. However, absolute barrier performance for whole bottles (vs. discreet test samples from bottle side walls) will depend on such factors as coating uniformity and thickness, percentage of total bottle surface area covered, optimum orientation of the laminar mineral within the coating layer. container imperfections, if any, which can result from the blow molding process,<br>
3$      and the like.<br>
The container optionally includes a second clear coat layer (C) adhered to the first coating layer which comprises a curable composition comprising (a) a binder component in (b) an organic solvent.<br>
2<br><br>
According to another aspect, the invention is a method for packaging a carbonated liquid, i.e., a beverage, in a molded biaxially oriented rigid polyester container which comprises:<br>
(1)	forming the container;<br>
(2)	applying to at least one surface of the container a first coating layer having a thickness in the range of 8 microns or less by spraying onto the container an aqueous composition comprising (a) an organic binder, which is a water soluble or water-dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, and (b) from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modifled montmorillonite and mixtures thereof;<br>
(3)	drying the first coating layer at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, and optionally curing it at a temperature below the temperature at which heat distortion of the container can occur;<br>
(4)	applying to the first coating layer a second coating layer having a thickness in the range of about 12 microns or less by spraying onto said first coating layer a curable composition comprising (a) a binder component and (b) an organic solvent;<br>
(5)	curing the second coating layer;<br>
(6)	introducing a carbonated liquid into the container; and<br>
(7)	sealing the container.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the present invention is a method for reducing the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability of a polyester substrate, which is a film or a side-wall or bottom portion of a shaped or molded container, which comprises spraying onto at least one surface of the substrate a generally uniform aqueous coating composition to form a first coating layer which adheres to the substrate. The aqueous composition comprises a water-soluble or water dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, and from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof The laminar mineral comprises platelets, and the platelets move within the aqueous composition as it is sprayed onto the substrate to orient themselves in a generally parallel three-dimensional and overlapping spaced relationship within the first coating layer. According to one embodiment, the method includes (after drying and optionally curing the first coating layer as described above) the additional steps of (1) applying to the first coating layer a second coating layer having a thickness in the range of about 12 microns or less by spraying onto said first coating layer a<br>
3<br><br>
curable composition comprising (a) a binder component and (b) an organic solvent, and (2) curing the second coating layer.<br>
The invention according to another aspect is a water-borne gas barrier coating composition particularly well-suited for spray application onto polymeric 5      substrates. The coating composition contains at least 2% by wt. solids wherein the solids portion of the composition comprises:<br>
(a)	from greater than 10% to less than 90% by wt. of a film-forming water-dispersible or water-soluble organic binder;<br>
(b)	from less than 90% to greater than 10% by wt. of an inorganic laminar mineral in the form of platelets selected from montmorillonite. laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof; and, optionally,<br>
(c)	from 5% by wt. to 95% by wt., based on the weight of the organic binder, of a cross-linking agent.<br>
The invention is particularly well suited for improving the gas barrier performance of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films and rigid containers used for packaging foods and beverages, and especially injection stretch blow molded PET bottles used for packaging carbonated soft drinks and beer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention is a unique coating system for polymeric films and rigid.<br>
2p      i.e., shaped or molded, containers produced from conventional polymeric<br>
materials and comprises a first, optionally cross-linked, coating layer based on a water-borne composition and an optional second substantially clear coating layer based on a two-component solvent/binder composition. A preferred embodiment of the invention embraces the dual coating layer system applied to either a<br>
25      polymeric film or the exterior surface of a rigid container, particularly an injection stretch blow molded biaxially oriented polyester container, to achieve substantially increased resistance to permeation by oxygen and carbon dioxide, e.g.. up to 20 to 30 times or more resistance to permeation vs. a polymeric film or container without the coating system. The coating compositions, moreover, can be applied economically to films or containers by any convenient spray application method. Polymeric films and containers having the first barrier coating layer typically exhibit for a given polymeric film thickness, based on test samples cut from container sidewalls, an Oxygen Permeability Value in the range of about 0.7 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm or less, which is one means for determining 35     and comparing gas barrier performance. In some applications, the Oxygen<br>
Permeability Value can be as low as 0.07 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm, and even lower, e.g., in the range of 0.03 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm. The substantially clear overcoat<br>
4<br><br>
operates to protect the first barrier coating layer from deterioration, degradation, etc. during use.<br>
An important feature derived from the invention is that the coating system does not interfere with the ability to recycle coated films or plastic containers. The first coaling layer, which is the gas barrier layer, is water soluble and relatively easy to remove. For containers and films having the two-layer system, the coating system can be removed by scoring the outer clear coat layer to allow water or other solvent to penetrate and dissolve the coaling system. Polymeric Substrate<br>
The gas barrier coating system of the invention can be applied to practically any thermoplastic polymeric surface. Films and rigid containers contemplated for use according to the invention include those formed from conventional thermoplastic polymers, such as poiyolefins, polyamides, and engineering polymers, such as polycarbonates, and the like. The invention is particularly applicable to films and rigid, i.e., shaped, containers, and especially injection stretch blow molded biaxialiy oriented hollow thermoplastic containers, such as bottles, formed from synthetic linear polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, and the like, including homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene terephthalate and ethylene naphthaJate wherein up to about 50 mole percent or more of the copolymer can be prepared from the monomer units of diethylene glycol; propane-1,3-diol; butane-1,4-diol; polytetramethylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; polypropylene glycol and 1,4-hydroxymethylcyclohexane substituted for the glycol moiety in the preparation of the copolymer; or isophthalic, dibenzoic; naphthalene 1,4- or 2.6-dicarboxylic; adipic; sebacic; anddecane-l,10-dicarboxylic acid substituted for the acid moiety in the preparation of the copolymer. The foregoing description is intended to be an illustration of applicable polymeric substrates and not by way of a limitation on the scope of the invention. First Coating Layer<br>
The first coating layer, i.e., the gas barrier coating layer, is formed from a water-borne composition which contains at least 2% by weight solids.  Water is the primary carrier or solvent for the solids component of the barrier composition, although the composition may optionally contain a small amount, e.g., not more than about 10% by wt. based on the total amount of solvent, of a suitable co-solvent. The solids portion of the water-borne barrier composition contains generally from 10% up to less than 90% by wt., based on the weight of the first coating layer after drying/curing, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from phyllosilicates, and particularly montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified<br>
5<br><br>
montmorillonite and mixtures thereof.  'Organo-modified montmorilIonite,' is used herein to describe a clay material whereby an organic moiety has been strongly attached to the clay platelet by a treatment of subjecting the clay to an ion exchange process whereby interlammelar inorganic cations present in the clay are 5      replaced by organic cations comprising, but not limited to, either an organic group bonded to a cationic salt group, such as quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, pyridimum. or the like, or an organic compound containing a cationic amine salt group<br>
The laminar minerals are available commercially and comprise platelets )      which can have a thickness of from 10 to 60 Angstroms and an aspect ratio, i.e.. the ratio of the maximum width of a platelet to its thickness, of typically greater than 150. More detailed information on the composition and structure of phyllosillicate layer minerals can be found in "Clay Minerals". Their Structure. Behaviour &amp; Vsc'\ Proceedings of a Royal Society Discussion Meeting. 9 and 10 November 1983. London. The Royal Society. 1984.<br>
Commercially available montmorillonite platelets will have length and width dimensions which can both range from 150 to 250 nm, and commercially available laponite platelets will have length and width dimensions which can both range from 2 to 20 nm up to 20 to 200 nm. Platelet thickness will generally be in the range of 1 nm. Laminar minerals having lower levels of impurities, such as, for example, quartz, silica, mica, etc., are preferred over other commercial grades of laminar minerals for their improved barrier performance in use.<br>
The solids portion of the water-borne barrier composition will also include from greater than 10% by wt. to less than 90% by wt. of a water-soluble or water-dispersibie film-forming organic binder selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a)	homopolyesters; copolyesters, particularly core/shell type copolyesiers where the "core" is a copolyester of number average molecular weight around 12,000-25,000, and the "shell" is a modified (e.g., acrylic modified) hydrophilic polymer layer; and copolyesters derived from a sulpho derivative of a carboxylic acid selected from sulphoterephthalic acid and sulphoisophthalic acid;<br>
(b)	linear or branched acrylic resins having a weight average molecular weight of at least 3000;<br>
(c)	copolymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and their lower alkyi esters;<br>
(d)	polyolefins, particularly of a functionalized nature, such as maleinised poly butadiene;<br>
6<br><br>
(e) polysaccharides including cellulosic materials selected from cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, amylose, pluran. starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like which are synthesized by condensation polymerization of monosaccharides;<br>
(f)	polyvinyl alcohol;<br>
(g)	water based aliphatic or aromatic urethanes;<br>
(h) ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyvinylidene diehloride {PVDC), poly aery lonitrilc (PAN)and polyethyleimine, where the polyeihyleneimine polymers are of number average molecular weight of from 3000 10 100.000 and can be used alone or in conjunction with polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl lactam, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like; (i) melamine formaldehyde resin; (j) acrylic laiices; (k) polyvinyl acetate latices; (I) polyethylene glycol; and (m) blends thereof. The water soluble or water dispersible organic binder described above optionally contains (/) a cata/yst selected from sulfonic acids, amines, and tin catalysis and, also at the option of the user, (2) at least one cross-linking agent selected from melamine formaldehyde resin, epoxy resins, isocyanates, azindenes, carbodiimides, urea formaldehydes, phenolics, silanols, and acids. Water Soluble or Water Dispersible Organic Binder<br>
The copolyesters listed above in connection with the water dispersible organic binder component are the same type of polyesters suitable for use with the hydroxyl binder in the clear coating layer and described in greater detail below. They are characterized by exhibiting a final acid number of 15 or higher with the acid being neutralized by an amine, such as dimethanol amine, arninomethyl propanol, and the like.<br>
With respect to acrylic resins listed above, the term "linear or branched acrylic resins having a weight average molecular weight of at least 3000" includes those resins which can have functional groups (e.g., acid, amine, hydroxyl or epoxy) on the backbone, in the graft or on both backbone and graft. Also with respect to water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binders selected from linear or branched acrylic resins, the binder may comprise, in its overall concept, one type of water-soluble or water-dispersible graft acrylic copolymer which is formed by free-radical initiated co-polymerization of 5-95% by wt. alpha-beta unsaturated monomers in the presence of 95-5% by wt. of an acrylic macromonomer. The acrylic macromonomer is anionic in character with a preferred number average<br>
7<br><br>
molecular weight (MN) of between 500 to 20,000, and it contains less than aboui 1% of an acid functional alpha-beta unsaturated monomer, so that the backbone remains relatively hydrophilic and the macromonomer side chains remain relatively hydrophobic, following at least partial neutralization of the carboxyl 5      groups with, for example, an amine. These acrylic resins form stable solutions or dispersions in water, typically as a dispersed polymer having an average panicle size diameter of 10 nm to 1 micron, preferably 20 to 400 nro.<br>
Side chains of the graft copolymer are preferably hydrophobic relative to the backbone and therefore contain less than 1 % by weight, but preferably zero : 0      percent by weight, based on the weight of the graft copolymer, of polymerized ethyienicaliy unsaturated acid-functionai monomers. The side chains contain polymerized hydrophobic monomers, such as, for example, alkyl mcthacrylates and acrylates. styrene. cycloabphatic methacryiates and acrylates and aryl methacrylates and acrylates. They may also contain up to 30% by wt.. based on 15      the weight of the graft copolymer, of polymerized ethyienicaliy unsaturated noiv hydrophobic monomers which may contain functional groups. Examples of such monomers are hydroxy ethyl acrylate, hydroxy ethyl methacrylate. acrylamidc. nitro phenol acrylate, nitro phenol methacrylate, phthalimido methyl acrylate. phthalimido methacrylate, acrylic acid, acryloamido propane sulfonic acid, and 7 0      mixtures thereof.<br>
The acrylic macromonomer may be prepared using a free radical initiator in a solvent with a Co (II) or Co (III) chelate chain transfer agent.<br>
The backbone of the graft polymer contains preferably at least 2 percent by weight of an acid functional (neutralized) monomer, such as, for example, acrylic 15      acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid and the like, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Methacrylic and acrylic acid are preferred. Other acids that can be used<br>
are ethyienicaliy unsaturated sulfonic, sulfuric, phosphoric or phosphonic acid.<br>
Esters thereof can also be used, such as styrene sulfonic acid, acryiamido methyl<br>
propane sulfonic acid, vinyl phosphonic or phosphoric acid and the like.<br>
2 0	The backbone is preferably based on 2-30% methacrylic acid, most<br>
preferably 3 to 15%, and has an MN = 500-30,000. The acid functional groups on the graft copolymer are neutralized with an inorganic base or an amine. The backbone is thus relatively hydrophilic and keeps the graft polymer well dispersed in the resulting water-borne coating composition. Relative hydrophobic it y or 35      hydrophilicity can be further adjusted, if desired, by varying the percent of acid and/or hydroxy functional monomers versus more hydrophobic monomers such as 2-ethyl hexy! methacrylate.<br>
8<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, when the water-soluble or water-dispersiblc organic binder for the barrier composition comprises one or moicacrylic graft copolymers it (or they) will contain overall (including backbone and macromonomer arms, if any) from as low as 0 up to 40, but preferably 10 to 30, paris by weight of hydroxy functional acrylic monomers as, e.g.. 2-hydrox&gt;-ethyl acrylate. 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyI acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, and 4-hydroxybuty! acrylate.  These hydroxy groups can be used for crosslinking in addition 10 the acid groups.   Hydroxy groups are not necessary when acid groups are the only J 0      crosslinking functionality on the copolymer.<br>
After the graft copolymer is formed, it is neutralized with an amine or an inorganic base, such as ammonium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, and then water is added to form a dispersion. Typical amines that can be used include AMP (2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol)? dimethyl-AMP, amino methyl propanol, amino ethyl propanol. dimethyl ethanol amine, triethylamine and the like. One preferred amine is amino methyl propanol, and a preferred inorganic base is ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Another type of graft acrylic may be used wherein the graft is relatively hydrophilic and contains at least about 2% by wt. acid functional monomers, such 2|0     as acrylic and methacryiic acid. The graft may contain from 2% to 30% by wt. of this acid functional monomer. The backbone of the polymer would be hydrophobic and contain less than 2% by wt. of the acid functional monomer.<br>
Linear film-forming acrylic polymers, using similar monomers as in the<br>
above-described graft acrylic polymers with at least 2% by wt. acrylic acid or<br>
methacryiic acid may be used alone or in conjunction with the graft copolymer.<br>
The number average molecular weight of these acrylic polymers will be in the<br>
range of 3,000 to 100,000. The polymers can be neutralized using the same<br>
amines which are named in connection with the above-described graft polymers.<br>
The term "polyvinyl alcohol" as used above refers to a polymer<br>
3|0     predominately comprising a monomer unit of vinyl alcohol, particularly a product<br>
obtained by hydrolyzing (saponifying) the ester of a vinyl acetate polymer or other<br>
such polymers as vinyl trifluoroacetate polymer, vinyl formate polymer, vinyl<br>
pivalate polymer, t-butyl vinyl ether polymer, and tromethylsilyl vinyl ether<br>
polymer. The degree of saponification is preferably 70 mole % or higher.<br>
35	Water based urethanes listed above are of the basic types and include<br>

Sanprene® UX5100A. Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd), polyethers and aliphatic or aromatic polvether urethanes (e.g., Zeneca® R960 resin). Typical acrylic latices useful in the invention are those made from monomers, such as alky] methacrylates and acrylates; ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomers, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; and hydroxy functional monomers, such as hydroxyeihyl acrylate or hydroxyethyl methacrylate. A latex, such as commercially available acrylic latices, e.g., Neocryl™ (ICI. Wilmington. DE) can also be used as a component of the organic binder for the barrier composition One can also use polyvinyl acetate latices (e.g., UCA_R® Latex 379. Union Carbide).<br>
The binder may be cured with a curing agent which contains N-methylol and/or N-methylol ether groups. Examples of such curing agents arc amino resins obtained by reacting an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde, with a compound containing an amino group, such as melaminc, urea and benzoguanamine and total or partial etherification of the N-methylol group with an alcohol, such as. for example, methanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol.<br>

Paratoluenc sulfonic acid or its ammonium salt are preferred catalysts. Other catalysts that can be used are dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and amine or ammonium salts of these acids.<br>

The binder composition may also contain a co-solvent of the type which can be used in water borne compositions, such as isopropanol, butanof, butyl celosolve, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and others.<br>
To improve weatherability of a first coating layer produced from the barrier coating composition of the invention, an ultraviolet light stabilizer or a combination of ultraviolet light stabilizers can be added in the amount of from ip      about 0.1 to 5% by wt., based on the weight of the binder. Such stabilizers<br>
include ultraviolet light absorbers, screeners, quenchers, and specific hindered amine light stabilizers and are typically selected from benzophenoncs, iriazoles. triazines. henzoaies, hindered amines and mixtures thereof. An antioxidant can also be added in an amount from about 0.1 to 5% by wt.. based on the weight of the binder.<br>
The composition may also include other formulation additives, such as thickeners, e.g., Acrylsol™ copolymers (Rohm &amp; Haas); pigments; dispersants, e.g.. sodium tripoiyphosphate; and surfactants to assist wetting out of the water-borne coating composition during spray application e.g., nonyl phenyl ethoxylate, 1)      such as NP10 or NP8; or a fluorosurfactant, e.g., Zonyl® fluorosurfactant (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE).<br>
A water-bome system is critical for achieving optimum gas barrier performance from the barrier composition of the invention. Water, even in the presence of up to about 10% by wt., based on total weight of solvent, of a co-solvent, influences exfoliation of the individual laminar mineral platelets and allows their free movement and orientation within the composition. When the barrier composition is applied to a polymeric substrate, e.g., the exterior surface of a blow molded PET bottle, via any convenient spray application technique and is then heated, i.e., cured, (e.g., at a temperature in the range of from 60 to 70°C for 3p      from 10 to 15 minutes), it will form a dry first coating layer typically having a film thickness in the range of 20 microns, but more typically in the range of 8 microns or less. The individual mineral platelets will have oriented themselves and become fixed within the cured organic binder layer in a generally parallel three-dimensional and over-lapping spaced relationship. The gas barrier 3(5      performance of a polymeric substrate coated in this manner is from 20 to 30 times or more greater, when compared, for example, by respective Oxygen Permeability Values, than the substrate alone.<br>
11<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the water-borne barrier coating composition comprises montmorillonite as the inorganic laminar mineral in the form of platelets having an aspect ratio of from 20 to 500 and an average particle size of less than 5 microns, (e.g., Montmorillonite Mineral Colloid MO available from Southern Clay Products. Inc., Texas, USA) The preferred organic binder for the first coating layer based on observed barrier performance is a blend of (i) melamine formaldehyde resin (including melamine formaldehyde wjth imino functionality, methyloi functionality and partially or highly alkoxy methyl functionality) with (ii) from 5% to 25% by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an acrylic latex. The preferred first coating layer of the barrier composition will contain (based on dry weight) from 10 to 75% w/w inorganic mineral plateiets and from 25 to 90% w/w organic binder. Second Clear Coat Layer<br>
Because of the water solubility of the first coating layer, which renders a coated polymeric film or rigid, i.e., shaped, container highly recyclable, it is desirable for the coating to be fully, i.e,, from 80% to 100%. cross-linked. For some applications, however, it may be desirable to employ a two-layer barrier coating system wherein a second coating layer is applied which is a solvent based two component clear coat which comprises (a) from 20 to 80% by wt. of an 2p      organic solvent and (b) from 80 to 20% by wt. of a binder component. A clear coat second coating layer imparts water resistance, impact resistance, hardness. mar resistance, appearance qualities (gloss and distinctness of image) and clarity, i.e.. key performance properties, to the overall gas barrier coating system. It also insures more consistent overall performance since the underlying first barrier 2(5      coating layer need not always be 100% cross-linked.<br>
The binder component of the second clear coat composition can be an epoxy/amine cross-linked system or an epoxy/acid cross-linked system. Preferably, the binder component of the second clear coat composition is a system which includes a hydroxyl component with a cross-linking component, and is 3 3      selected from the group consisting of:<br>

15<br><br>

The second layer clear coat composition may also contain conventional additives, such as UV screeners and organic or inorganic pigments for timing the otherwise clear coat for color, stabilizers, rheology control agents, flow control agents and toughening agents depending on the intended end use for the coated polymeric substrate. The foregoing additives may be added to either the hydroxyl or cross-linking component, or to both, depending upon the intended use for the coating composition.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention can be applied to practically any polymeric substrate by any convenient spray method including air spraying or an electrostatically assisted spray application method including compressed air spray, mini bells, and discs. The coating compositions are also suitable for airless spray application, or by doctor blade and roller coat application, but spray application is preferred for obtaining optimum orientation of the mineral platelet particles within the applied barrier coating layer, and, thereby, optimum and consistent barrier performance. For applications which require only the first barrier coating layer, the coating is allowed to flash at ambient conditions for a<br>
16<br><br>
short period of time, usually less than two minutes, during which time water can evaporate, and then the coated substrate is placed in an oven for additional curing at a predetermined elevated temperature.  For applications which require the two-coating layer system, the barrier layer is spray applied and allowed to flash at ambient temperature for up to two minutes or less. Evaporation of the water in the barrier layer can be accelerated using infra-red lamps or via oven curing at a temperature of from 50c to 60°C for from 10 to 30 minutes.  Higher temperatures, e.g., from 60° lo 80°C\ may also be used in situations where complete curing of the barrier layer is required before application of the clear coat. The solvent based clear coat is applied after flashing and/or heating the barrier layer, and the two-layer system is then allowed to flash at ambient conditions for up to*2 minutes. Thereafter, coated substrates are oven cured at from 60° to 80°C for from 10 to 30 minutes. The curing temperatures and curing times may vary widely and will depend on economics (i.e., cure time vs. temperature) and on the type of polymeric substrate being cured and the time over which it can withstand elevated temperatures without melting or otherwise degrading-<br>
The invention is illustrated in greater detail with reference to the Examples which follow, however, the invention is not to be limited by the Examples. Spray Application Method<br>
Test specimens were sprayed using a standard De Vilbis air supported hand-held spray un. The air pressure supply was set between 40 and 70 psi (275.8 to 482.6 kPa) depending on the viscosity of the composition being sprayed. Spraying took place onto a 0.5 liter or 2 liter PET bottle while it was rotated about its long axis between 200 to 400 rpm. The spray gun was passed up and down the length of the rotating bottle at a rate of one pass every 2 seconds for the 2-liter bottle for a predetermined number of passes, usually between 2 to 15 passes from a distance of about 15 cm. The objective was to insure coverage of the main side wall, shoulder, base and neck region of each test specimen at a generally uniform coating thickness in the range of 12 microns or Jess. Coated test specimens were then placed in an air circulating oven to dry at a temperature of from 60°C lo 70°C for between 5 and J 5 minutes. Surface Pre-Treatment<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to pre-treat the surface of the polymeric substrate to be coated to enhance adhesion of the first coating layer to the substrate and/or to improve wetting of the substrate by the coating composition. Thus, the instant invention includes the optional step of treating the surface of the container that will be receiving the coating composition with a means to improve surface adhesion characteristics whereby the coating composition will consistently<br>
17<br><br>
and uniformly adhere to the substrate surface when it dnes. Means or methods for surface pre-treatment are conventional and include flame treating, application of a chemical mist, and by exposing the polymeric surface to a plasma for a predetermined period of time. Oxygen Permeability Value<br>
Oxygen permeability was determined by cutting a ] 0 X 10 cm square from the side wall of a coated PET bottle and measuring oxygen transmission through the specimen using a Mocon, Oxtran 10/50 s/n 1187145 at 30°C and 90% relative humidity. The container wall sample was place in the Mocon test cell with nitrogen carrier gas flowing above and below the sample, and it was left to equilibrate over night in order to flush dissolved oxygen from the sample and obtain a background reading.  The nitrogen above the sample was then replace with oxygen and left to equilibrate over night, and then the amount of oxygen which had permeated through the sample was measured using a sensor.  The average thickness of the sample was measured using a micrometer, and this measurement was used to calculate the oxygen permeability for standard units of cc mil/100 in2/day/atm. Control measurements were carried out on uncoated bottles in the same way. Typical wall thickness for commercially produced PET bottles for carbonated beverages and soft drinks are between 200-350 microns. Color was measured using a Colorgard 2000/45 instrument to give values of b* (yellowness) with lower values indicating lower color. The ash weight of samples was determined by heating the sample to 600°C and thereafter measuring the residual weight of the sample. Preparation of Gas Barrier Coating Composition<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, a general procedure was followed in preparing water-borne gas barrier coating compositions according to the invention for the following examples. A 2 kg slurry containing 4% by wt. montmorillonite clay was first prepared by combining 120 g montmorillonite clay with 1871 g demincralized water in a 4-liter beaker. The demineralised water was added to the 4-litcr beaker, and the beaker was placed under a Silverson high shear mixer with the mixer head positioned to one side of the beaker for maximum mixing efficiency with reduced entrapment of air. Mixer was begun at 2500 rpm. Mixer rpm was increased to 8200 rpm and the montmorillontite clay was added slowly to allow for dispersal in the water. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes, and then the mixer head was raised and cleaned of un-dispersed clay, which was added back to the slurry. Mixing was then continued, and the rpm increased steadily to 8200 rpm. This process was repeated until a uniform slurry without lumps or agglomerates was observed, which took about 30 minutes.<br>
18<br><br>
I he organic binder component was prepared by first weighing ] 3.5 g of Cyme) 385 (available from Cytec Industries as 79% w/w aqueous solution) into a 250 ml beaker.  To this was added 89 grams of deminerali zed water, and the mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer until the Cymel® 385 was completely dissolved in the water (about 5 minutes). Thereafter 3.5 ml of PTSA 10% solution and 0.5 ml of Synperonic NP10 10% solution were added 'dropwise' to the solution and allowed to stir for an additional 10 minutes.<br>
Then 370 grams of the montmorillomte slurry was weighed into a 1000 ml beaker and stirred using an anchor type stirrer with an air powered motor. The slurry was stirred rapidlv at first to break up the thixotropy. When the slurry had become mobile, the stirrer was then slowed to the point where there was a vortex which just covered the stirrer paddles. The prepared binder solution was then poured into a dropping funnel and added very slowly through this to the siirred monimoriJlonite slum'.  This process took about 20 minutes to complete and was earned out to ensure even mixing.  When the addition was finished the stirrer speed was lowered so that the vortex disappeared, but the whole of the solution was still mobile.  The resulting mixture was stirred slowly for about 30 minutes which allowed the mixture to de-aerate and then the coating composition was ready for use.<br>

This mixture was then added as a shot to the refluxing batch in the 2-liter flask, and the resulting mixture held at agitation and reflux temperature for 5 minutes. An initiator feed mixture was prepared by dissolving 0.039 grams of cobalt (iii) chain transfer catalyst and 2.84 grams 2,2-azobis-(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) in 31.1 grams methyl ethyl ketone and 65.1 grams isopropanol. A monomer feed mixture was prepared by mixing together 85.7 grams methacrylic acid, 141.8 grams methyl methacrylate and 6.2 grams isopropanol. The monomer and initiator feeds were simultaneously added to the refluxing, agitating mixture in the 2-liter flask with the following feed schedules: 55% of the initiator feed was added over 90 minutes and the remaining 45% was fed over 240 minutes. 67% of the monomer 3p      feed was added over 120 minutes, and the remaining 33% fed over 120 minutes.<br>
