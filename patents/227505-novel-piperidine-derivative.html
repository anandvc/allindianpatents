				<td>The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins la and 1(3 (MlP-lαand MIP-1ß).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br>
Viral infections are known to cause lung inflammation. It has been shown experimentally that the common cold increases mucosal output of eotaxin in the airways. Instillation of eotaxin into the nose can mimic some of the signs and symptoms of a common cold. (See, Greiff L et al Allergy (1999) 54(11) 1204-8 [Experimental common cold increase mucosal output of eotaxin in atopic individuals] and Kawaguchi M et al Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. (2000) 122 SI 44 [Expression of eotaxin by normal airway epithelial cells after virus A infection].)<br>

Pharmacological Analysis: Calcium flux [Ca 2+]i assay Human eosinophils<br>
Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1991,145.105-110). The cells were resuspended (5xlO6 ml/1) and loaded with 5µM FLUO-3/AM + Pluronic F127 2.2µl/ mL (Molecular Probes) in low potassium solution (LKS; NaCl 118mM, MgSO4 0.8mM, glucose 5.5mM, Na2CO3 8.5mM, KC1 5mM, HEPES 20mM, CaCl2 1.8mM, BSA 0.1%, pH 7.4) for one hour at room temperature. After loading, cells were centrifuged at 200xg for 5min and resuspended in LKS at 2.5xl06 mL-1. The cells were then transferred to 96 well FLIPr plates (Poly-D-Lysine plates from Becton Dickinson pre-incubated with 5µM fibronectin for two hours) at 25µl/well. The plate was centrifuged at 200g for 5min and the cells were washed twice with LKS (200µl; room temperature).<br>
A compound of the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO and added to a final concentration of 0.1%(v/v)DMSO. Assays were initiated by the addition of an A50 concentration of eotaxin and the transient increase in fluo-3 fluorescence (IEX =490nm and IEM= 520nM) monitored using a FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, U.S.A.).<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists if the increase in fluorescence induced by eotaxin (a selective CCR3 agonist) was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. The concentration of antagonist required to inhibit the fluorescence by 50% can be used to determine the IC50 for the antagonist at the CCR3 receptor.<br>
EXAMPLE 85 Human eosinophil chemotaxis<br>
Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al.,J. Immunol Methods, 1991,145.105-110). The cells were resuspended at l0xl06 mL-1 in RPMI containing 200IU/ mL penicillin, 200µg/ mL streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% HIFCS, at room temperature.<br>
Eosinophils (700 µl) were pre-incubated for 15 mins at 37° C with 7 µl of either vehicle or compound (l00x required final concentration in 10% DMSO). The chemotaxis<br>
plate (ChemoTx, 3µm pore, Neuroprobe) was loaded by adding 28µl of a concentration of eotaxin 0.1 to l00nM (a selective CCR3 agonist over this concentration range) containing a concentration of a compound according to the Examples or solvent to the lower wells of the chemotaxis plate. The filter was then placed over the wells and 25 µl of eosinophil suspension were added to the top of the filter. The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a humidified incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere to allow chemotaxis.<br>
The medium, containing cells that had not migrated, was carefully aspirated from above the filter and discarded. The filter was washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM EDTA to remove any adherent cells. Cells that had migrated through the filter were pelleted by centrifugation (300xg for 5 mins at room temperature) and the filter removed and the supernatant transferred to each well of a 96-well plate (Costar). The pelleted cells were lysed by the addition of 28 µl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton xl00 followed by two cycles of freeze/thawing. The cell lysate was then added to the supernatant. The number of eosinophils migrating was quantified according to the method of Strath et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1985, 83,209 by measuring eosinophil peroxidase activity in the supernatant.<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists of eotaxin mediated human eosinophil chemotaxis if the concentration response to eotaxin was shifted to the right of the control curve. Measuring the concentration of eotaxin required to give 50% chemotaxis in the presence or absence of compounds enables the apparent affinity of the compounds at CCR3 to be calculated.<br>
EXAMPLE 86 Guinea-pig isolated trachea<br>
(See for example, Harrison, R.W.S., Carswell, H. &amp; Young, J.M. (1984) European J. Pharmacol., 106,405-409.)<br>
Male albino Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs (250 g) were killed by cervical dislocation and the whole trachea removed. After clearing the adherent connective tissue, the trachea was cut into six ring segments each three cartilage bands wide and then suspended in 20 mL organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl 117.6, NaH2PO4 0.9, NaHCO3 25.0, MgSO41.2, KC15.4, CaCl2 2.6 and glucose 11.1. The buffer was maintained at 37°C and gassed with 5% CO2 in oxygen. Indomethacin (2.8µM) was added to the Krebs solution to prevent development of smooth muscle tone due to the synthesis of cyclo-<br>
oxygenase products. The trachea! rings were suspended between two parallel tungsten wire hooks, one attached to an Ormed beam isometric force transducer and the other to a stationary support in the organ bath. Changes in isometric force were recorded on 2-channel Sekonic flat bed chart recorders. Experimental protocols<br>
At the beginning of each experiment a force of Ig was applied to the tissues and this was reinstated over a 60 minute equilibration period until a steady resting tone was achieved. Subsequently, a cumulative histamine concentration effect (E/[A]) curve was constructed at 0.5 logic unit increments, in each tissue. The tissues were then washed and approximately 30 minutes later, test compound or vehicle (20% DMSO) was added. Following an incubation period of 60 minutes a second E/[A] curve was performed to histamine.<br>
Contraction responses were recorded as a percentage of the first curve maximum. Data analysis<br>
Experimental E/[A] curve data were analysed for the purposes of estimating the potencies (p[A5o] values) of histamine in the absence and presence of the test compound. Affinity (pA2) values of test compounds were subsequently calculated using the following equation:<br>
log(r-l) = log[B]+pA2<br>
where r = [A]50 in presence of test compound/[A]5o in absence of antagonist and [B] is the concentration of test compound. Compounds of the Examples were found to be HI antagonists.<br>
EXAMPLE 87<br>
Histamine HI receptor binding activity of compounds of the invention was assessed by competition displacement of InM [3H]-pyrilamine (Amersham, Bucks, Product code TRK 608, specific activity 30Ci/mmol) to 2/tg membranes prepared from recombinant CHO-K1 cells expressing the human HI receptor (Euroscreen SA, Brussels, Belgium, product code ES-390-M) in assay buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4 containing 2mM MgCl2,250mM sucrose and l00mM NaCl) for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
