				<td>Field of the invention:-<br>
The invention relates to a pneumatic condensing device for a fibre composite which<br>
has preferably previously been drafted in a drawframe of a spinning machine,<br>
according to the following description.<br>
Background and prior art:-<br>
What is known as a double-apron drawframe is already known as general prior art<br>
(DE 43 23 472 C2). Here, the fibre composite leaving the pair of delivery rollers is<br>
exposed, over the length of the fibre bundling zone, to a suction-airstream running<br>
transversely to the transport direction. The fibre composite is in this case acted upon<br>
by a plane transport means which is designed as a perforated apron. The apron can<br>
be driven by means of a roller drive. The apron is guided by an apron cage which is<br>
designed as a suction-extraction device. The apron cage possesses a groove, closed<br>
on one side, for guiding the suction air. A support is provided which is designed as a<br>
rectangular profile. The support is mounted adjustably; its inclination can be<br>
modified and consequently the start of condensing can be regulated. By means of<br>
the said support, the sucked-in air can be utilized as a lateral force component, this<br>
having an advantageous effect on the desired condensing of the fibre composite.<br>
DE 197 22 528 A1 is to be seen as a development of the abovementioned prior art<br>
for the present invention. Here, the apron possesses perforations formed in a<br>
different size in the running direction, so that, after a rough congregation of the fibre<br>
. composite by means of the large perforations, the actual condensing of the<br><br>
latter takes place by means of the perforations which<br>
are kept smaller. A good condensing of the fibre<br>
composite is thereby achieved. The yarns produced<br>
thereafter satisfy high quality demands. Recently,<br>
however, there have been requirements for yarns of<br>
still higher quality.<br>
By means of a further development, as described in<br>
Melliand Textile Reports 4/2001 on pages 246 to 248, a<br>
substantial improvement is achieved in that a cover is<br>
placed opposite the suction orifice of the suction<br>
shoe. Sucked-in air can thereby be utilized in a<br>
controlled way as a lateral force component; the<br>
suction-airstream is forced into a flow running<br>
laterally towards the fibre composite, with the result<br>
that a greater traversing width is possible. In<br>
conjunction with the length of the condensing zone, a<br>
good fixing of the fibre composite on the perforation<br>
of the apron can be achieved. The yarns produced<br>
accordingly fulfil higher quality demands. Recently,<br>
however, there have been requirements for yarns of even<br>
higher quality.<br>
It was shown that, in many instances, an airflow<br>
running along the fibre composite is suitable for<br>
laying projecting fibre ends onto the fibre composite<br>
particularly effectively. Immediately before the<br>
airflow passes through the air-permeable transport<br>
means, the suction-airstream is deflected into a<br>
direction transverse to the fibre composite, flows<br>
through the latter and at the same time condenses it.<br>
Object of the invention:-<br>
The object of the present invention is to improve a<br>
condensing device of the abovementioned type in as<br>
simple and as cost-effective a way as possible.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, in<br>
that a cover is provided, which has at least one guide<br>
means for the air causing the condensing, the said<br><br>
guide means extending in the running direction of the<br>
fibre composite. This makes it possible to have an<br>
airflow running preferably along the fibre composite<br>
and therefore excellent condensing.<br>
The guide means may be designed, for example, as<br>
elevations in the manner of a pair of rails, but<br>
preferably, because of more cost-effective<br>
practicability and a saving of material, as a groove.<br>
When, in an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
cross-sectional area of the groove is markedly larger<br>
than the diameter of the fibre composite running<br>
through the groove, what is achieved, on the one hand,<br>
is that the said groove opposes low resistance to the<br>
sucked-in air and has established in it a strong<br>
airstream along the fibre composite running through.<br>
. What is achieved, on the other hand, is that the fibre<br>
composite does not slide along on the flanks of the<br>
groove and is not, for example, roughened there. The<br>
fibre composite is therefore in no way condensed<br>
mechanically by the groove.<br>
The cross-sectional area of the groove may be angular<br>
or rounded. Advantageously, it narrows in the direction<br>
of the fibre run. Since air is suction-extracted from<br>
the groove over the course of the condensing zone, what<br>
can be achieved thereby is that the velocity of the<br>
airflow along the fibre composite remains approximately<br>
of the same magnitude in this condensing zone.<br>
The flanks of the groove may be straight or convexly<br>
curved, and they may also run, in an initial region, in<br>
a funnel-like manner towards one another and then in<br>
parallel.<br>
A particularly strong airflow along the fibre composite<br>
is achieved when, in a further embodiment of the<br>
invention, care is taken to ensure that only a<br><br>
clearance such as to allow the transport means to run through without jamming is provided<br>
between that face of the suction shoe which has the air inlet orifice and the cover. As a<br>
result, a lateral approach flow of condensing air, as is sought after in known condensing<br>
devices, is, in contrast to these, as far as possible prevented in the device according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Further advantageous details and embodiments of the invention may be gathered from the<br>
following disclosure.<br>
The invention proceeds from a condensing device which consists, for example, of a suction<br>
shoe with a vacuum connection and, as transport means, of a perforated apron guided<br>
around a feed roller. The apron has a plurality of perforations arranged one behind the other<br>
in the running direction of the fibre composite. As soon as the fibres of the non-condensed<br>
fibre composite are picked up by the suction-airflow, they are pushed together by the latter<br>
and condensed.<br>
The invention, then, is explained further with reference to the accompanying drawings which<br>
illustrate a preferred exemplary embodiment.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawinas:-<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic side view of a double-apron drawframe with<br>
run-in rollers, the main drafting zone, a condensing device and a feed<br>
device,<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged illustration of the condensing device with a suction<br>
shoe and a suction connection in a diagrammatic side view,<br>
Fig. 2a shows a details of Fig. 2 in an enlarged illustration, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a detail of Fig. 1 and 2 in a top view.<br>
Detailed Description of the preferred embodiment:-<br>
Fig. 1 and 2 illustrate a drawframe 1 for a spinning machine for the drafting and bundling of<br>
a fibre<br><br>
composite 2. The said drawframe has a first pair of<br>
rollers 3 and a second pair of rollers 4 which is<br>
followed by a pair of delivery rollers 5. The main<br>
drafting of the fibre composite 2 takes place in the<br>
region between the second pair of rollers 4 and the<br>
pair of delivery rollers 5.<br>
The pair of delivery rollers 5 has adjacent to it a<br>
pneumatic condensing device 10. The latter is followed<br>
by a feed device 20 which again has a pair of rollers<br>
6. The fibre composite 2 is transported in the<br>
direction of the arrow between and through the pairs of<br>
rollers 3, 4, 5, 6 preferably driveable electromotively<br>
in a known way. In this case, the transport means 15,<br>
here designed as an apron, which is provided with<br>
perforations 16 is used, as is known, for example, from<br>
DE 197 22 528 Al already mentioned above. In the region<br>
between the pair of delivery rollers 5 and the pair of<br>
rollers 6 of the feed device 20 lies what is known as a<br>
fibre bundling zone 7. Here, the fibre composite 2<br>
leaving the pair of delivery rollers 5 of the drawframe<br>
1 is exposed to a suction-airstream 8 (Fig. 3) . The<br>
suction-airstream 8 is generated by a<br>
suction-extraction device 9 which extends between the<br>
pair of delivery rollers 5 and the feed device 20 on<br>
that side of the transport means 15 which faces away<br>
from the fibre composite 2.<br>
The suction-extraction device 9 has a suction shoe 17,<br>
over which the perforated apron, that is to say the<br>
transport means 15, is guided.<br>
Preferably, the perforations 16 of the transport means<br>
15 run at least over a traversing width of the fibre<br>
composite 2 which emerges from the pair of delivery<br>
rollers 5 and which is guided correspondingly via the<br>
suction orifice of the suction shoe 17 of the<br>
suction-extraction device 9. The suction shoe 17 is<br>
positioned between the pair of rollers 5 and 6 in such<br><br>
a way that it is nearer to the centre points of the<br>
rollers (of circular cross section, as is generally<br>
customary) arranged at the bottom than to those of the<br>
rollers arranged at the top. The suction shoe 17 thus<br>
projects relatively far downwards into the fibre<br>
bundling zone 7.<br>
A cover 30 is arranged opposite the suction orifice of<br>
the suction-extraction device 9. The cover 30 is<br>
designed as a rail and extends over the entire width of<br>
the drawframe 1. The said cover itself possesses a<br>
width B which is co-ordinated with the size of the<br>
suction orifice of the suction-extraction device, in<br>
particular is approximately the same size as the said<br>
suction orifice in the running direction of the fibre<br>
composite 2.<br>
Between that face 18 of the suction shoe 17 which has<br>
the air inlet orifice and the cover 30, there is a<br>
clearance which ensures that the apron 15 runs through<br>
without jamming. The suction shoe 17 is supported with<br>
a nose 19 on the cover 30, as shown in Fig. 2a.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, the cover 30 is designed to<br>
be curved downwards and, as seen in the running<br>
direction of the fibre composite 2, is slightly higher<br>
at the rear than at the front.<br>
The cover 30 has guide means 31, 31' for the fibre<br>
composite 2. The guide means 31, 31' are designed as<br>
grooves and extend with their length L straight ahead<br>
over the entire width B of the cover 30 in the running<br>
direction of the fibre composite 2. The width of the<br>
grooves 31, 31' is co-ordinated with the thickness of<br>
the fibre composite 2; as shown in Fig. 3, their cross<br>
section is markedly larger than that of the fibre<br>
composite 2 running through them.<br><br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in the middle and on<br>
the right in Fig. 3, the grooves 31 are of rectangular<br>
cross section and, at the start, possess a width bl<br>
which is approximately twice as large as the thickness<br>
of the non-condensed fibre composite 2. After about one<br>
quarter of their length L, the grooves 31 narrow to a<br>
width B2 which is about half as large as the width bl.<br>
The flanks 32 of the grooves 31 thus approach one<br>
another in the entry region of the fibre composite<br>
and then run further on parallel to one another. The<br>
groove depth corresponds here to at least about the<br>
thickness of the non-condensed fibre composite 2.<br>
In the left-hand region of Fig.	3 is illustrated a<br>
groove 31', the flanks 32' of	which are convexly<br>
curved. The groove 31' is	otherwise designed<br>
identically to the grooves 31.<br>
Overall, therefore, the grooves 31, 31' are designed in<br>
the manner of a suction duct in which a strong<br>
airstream is established along the fibre composite 2<br>
running through. This makes an excellent condensing of<br>
the fibre composite 2 possible.<br>
By the method according to the invention, the fibre<br>
composite 2 can not only be exposed to an airstream in<br>
the fibre running direction, as described above, but<br>
simultaneously or subsequently to an airstream<br>
transverse thereto, in order to achieve the best<br>
possible condensing.<br>
In this case, the velocity of the air causing the<br>
condensing should be higher by a multiple than the<br>
velocity of the fibre composite 2 running through. It<br>
may amount to up to ten times the velocity of the fibre<br>
composite. In practice, it is proved highly effective<br>
for the velocity selected for the air causing the<br>
condensing to be approximately twice as high as the<br>
velocity of the fibre composite 2 running through.<br><br>
A major advantage in the device according to the<br>
invention and of the method according to the invention<br>
is that, as compared with known devices and methods,<br>
the air requirement is reduced precisely because of the<br>
guide means according to the invention for the air<br>
causing the condensing, and more economical operation<br>
is thereby ensured.<br>
In addition to the suction air, blowing air may also be<br>
employed in order to assist the condensing action of<br>
the suction air. An even better condensing of the fibre<br>
composite and therefore, ultimately, an even higher<br>
yarn quality can thereby be achieved.<br>
In conclusion, it should also be mentioned that the<br>
invention can, of course, also be used in condensing<br>
devices which have transport means, for example, in the<br>
form of a screen apron. The suction orifice is then<br>
preferably designed as a narrow, straight or oblique<br>
suction slot. In the case of an oblique suction slot,<br>
the groove must, of course, be tailored to the oblique<br>
position of the slot.<br>
The invention can be used likewise in condensing<br>
devices which have transport means, for example, in the<br>
form of a rigid driven drum or in the form of a<br>
rotating sleeve which possess a screen surface or a<br>
perforation track.<br><br>
