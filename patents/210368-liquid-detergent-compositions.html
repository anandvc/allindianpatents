COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following  specification  particularly describes  the  nature  of invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 03/038029<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11265<br><br>
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to isotropic aqueous liquid detergent compositions.   It also relates to methods of using such compositions for the cleaning of substrates.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In liquid detergent compositions for the washing of textile fabrics, cationic polymer is sometimes included for reasons such as dye-transfer inhibition.  Preferred compositions that<br>
   give good dye-transfer inhibition results comprise as<br>
surfactant only nonionic surfactant(s) or are rich in nonionic surfactant(s). However, when the composition is an isotropic aqueous liquid composition and practical amounts of polymer and/or salts are included, then incompatibility between the<br>
    nonionic surfactants and/or salts can lead to cloudiness or even physical instability.<br>
We have now found that partially replacing the nonionic surfactant with anionic surfactant(s) solves the problem of<br>
   incompatibility with the cationic polymer.   Moreover we have found that when the anionic surfactant is partially or totally a soap, then the incompatibility of the composition with the salts is further significantly reduced.   A further advantage of using soap in isotropic formulations is improved foam<br>
    control, since the compatibility of isotropic formulations with silicon antifoam is often a problem.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides an isotropic aqueous liquid detergent composition comprising:<br>
(a)	from 0% to 6 %, preferably from 1% to 4% by weight of<br>
         synthetic anionic surfactant;<br>
(b)	from 5% to 25%, preferably from 10% to 20% by weight'<br>
of soap;<br>
        (c)  from 0.03% to 5%, preferably from 0.10% to 1% by<br>
weight of a cationic polymer or copolymer comprising at least one monomer unit which is cationic or carries at least one positive charge or carries a dipole moment greater than 3.5; and<br><br>
(d)  from 5% to 70%, preferably from 10% to 30% by weight of nonionic surfactant<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The Liquid Detergent Composition<br>
Liquid detergent compositions generally can be considered either to be isotropic or structured.  The compositions of the invention are isotropic, i.e. they are transparent unless an  opacifier has been added.<br>
The liquid composition may be formulated as a concentrated cleaning liquid for direct application to a substrate, or for application to a substrate following dilution, such as dilution  before or during use of the liquid composition by the consumer or in washing apparatus.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
3<br>
Whilst the composition and method according to the present invention may be used for cleaning any suitable  substrate, the preferred substrate  is a laundry fabric.  Gleaning may be carried out by  simply leaving the substrate in contact  for a  sufficient period of time with a medium constituted by or prepared from the  liquid cleaning composition.     Preferably, however,   the  cleaning medium on or containing. the  substrate is agitated.<br>
   Compositions  according	to the present invention preferably have<br>
a viscosity of no more	than  1,500 mPa.s, more preferably no<br>
more than 1,000 mPa.s,	still more preferably, no more than 500<br>
mPa.s.<br>
   Isotropic liquid cleaning compositions are defined for the present purpose as liquid detergent compositions wherein the surfactants do not form liquid crystalline phases, like multilamellar droplets of surfactant material. Isotropic liquids are generally   not    birefringent   under   static   conditions   but   may   be<br>
   birefringent under flow. In practical terms, instability in the isotropic nature of a composition is determined when it becomes hazy or separates into two or more different layers.<br>
Water<br>
Preferably  the  amount  of  water  in  the  liquid  detergent  composition is from 5 to 95%, more preferred from 25 to 75%, most preferred from 30 to 50%.  Especially preferred less than 45% by weight.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
4<br>
Surfactant<br>
The isotropic compositions according to the present invention preferably comprise from 1 to 90%, more preferably from 10 to 70% by weight of a synthetic anionic, nonionic, cationic,  zwitterionic active detergent material or mixture thereof. Most preferably, the compositions comprise 12 to 60 % of surfactant, more preferably 15 to 40%.  However, the amount of synthetic anionic surfactant is from 0% to 6%, preferably from 1% to 4% by weight of the composition.  The invention is suited  to compositions having higher levels of soap plus synthetic surfactant, e.g. above 30% by weight of the composition, although it can also be embodied in compositions with lower levels of these ingredients.<br>
   Non-limiting examples of other surfactants useful herein typically at levels from about 0% to about 6%, by weight, include the conventional C11-C18 alkylbenzene sulphonates ("LAS"), the C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulphates of the formula CH3(CH2)X(CHOS03-M+)CH3 and CH3(CH2)y(CHOS03-M+)CH2CH3<br>
    where x and (y + 1) are integers of at least about 7,<br>
preferably at least about 9, and M is a water-solubilising cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulphates such as oleyl sulphate, C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-7 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-C18 glycerol ethers, the C10-<br>
   C18alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulphated<br>

Other sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3 - methoxypropyl) glucamide. C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used.<br>
Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants are especially  useful. Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.<br>
Other anionic surfactants useful for detersive purposes can also be included in the isotropic compositions hereof. These<br>
   can include salts (including, for example, sodium potassium, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts such a mono-, di- and triethanolamine salts) of soap, C9-C20 linear alkylbenzenesulphonates, C8-C22 primary or secondary alkanesulphonates, C8-C24 olefinsulphonates, sulphonated<br>

   trimethyl ammonium and quaternary ammonium cations, e.g., tetramethyl-ammonium and dimethyl piperdinium, and cations derived from alkanolamines such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, and mixtures thereof, and the like.<br><br>
Typically, alkyl chains of C12-C16 are preferred for lower wash temperatures (e.g., below about 50°C and C16-C18 alkyl chains are preferred for higher wash temperatures (e.g., about 50°C) .<br>
   Alkyl alkoxylated sulphate surfactants are another category of preferred anionic surfactant. These surfactants; are water soluble salts or acids typically of the<br>
formula RO(A)mSO3M wherein R is an unsubstituted C10-C24 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group having a C10-C24 alkyl component,<br>

hydrogen or a water soluble cation which can be, for example, a metal cation (e.g., sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, etc.), ammonium or substituted-ammonium cation. Alkyl ethoxylated sulphates as well as alkyl propoxylated  sulphates are contemplated herein. Specific examples of substituted ammonium cations include methyl-, dimethyl-, trimethyl-ammonium and quaternary ammonium cations, such as tetramethyl-ammonium, dimethyl piperdinium and cations derived from alkanolamines, e.g., monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, and<br>
 triethanolamine, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary surfactants are C12-C18 alkyl polyethoxylate (1.0) sulphate, C12- C18 alkyl polyethoxylate (2.25) sulphate, C12-C18 alkyl polyethoxylate (3.0) sulphate, and C12-C18 alkyl polyethoxylate (4.0) sulphate wherein M is conveniently selected from sodium and potassium.<br><br>

   disclosure of these types of surfactants is found in U.S. Pat. 3,929,678.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>

9<br>
The amount of soap will vary depending on the particular characteristics desired in the final detergent isotropic composition but range from 5% to 25%, preferably from 10% to  20% by weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention must include one or more cationic polymers, materials e.g. effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the<br>
   cleaning process.  Typically, they are polymers or copolymers derived from monomers having or forming cyclic or non-cyclic groups containing a quaternary nitrogen atom, e.g. derived from vinyl pyrrolidone and/or vinylimidazole monomers.  Such polymers include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-<br>
  oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-<br>
vinylimidazole and mixtures thereof.  The amount of cationic polymer is from about 0.03% to about 5% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.05% to about 3%, and more preferably from about 0.10% to about 1% by weight of the total<br>
   composition.  The number average molecular weight of such polymers is typically from 3,000 to 50,000, preferably from 5,000 to 30,000.<br>
The Polymer<br>
   The polymer comprises a polymer or copolymer comprising at least one monomer which is cationic or carries at least one positive charge or carries a dipole moment greater than 3.5.<br>
To determine the dipole moment, one can use the AMI method of the MOPAC program, e.g. in v.6.0.  This is outlined in Dewar, M.J.S., 30 J. Mol. Struct., 100, 41 (1983).  In October 2001, a copy of the program was downloadable from http://qcpe.chem.indiana.edu/.<br><br>

Solvents<br>
Isotropic liquid detergent compositions contain water and  optionally, other solvents as carriers.  Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilising surfactant. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
 Clarity<br>
The clarity of the isotropic compositions according to the present invention does not preclude the isotropic composition being coloured, e.g. by addition of a dye, provided that it does not detract substantially from clarity.  Moreover, an<br>
 opacifier could be included to reduce clarity if required to appeal to the consumer.  In that case the definition of clarity applied to the isotropic composition according to any aspect of the invention will apply to the base (equivalent) isotropic composition without the opacifier.<br><br>
Detergency Builders<br>
Suitable water soluble inorganic detergency builders, which are optional components of compositions according to the present invention, are electrolytes, i.e. are not water soluble.<br><br>

13<br>
Examples of phosphorous-containing inorganic detergency builders, when present, include the water-soluble salts, especially alkali metal pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, polyphosphates and phosphonates.  Specific examples of  inorganic phosphate builders include sodium and potassium tripolyphosphates, phosphates and hexametaphosphates. Phosphonate sequestrant builders may also be used.<br>

Specific examples include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium  and substituted ammonium salts of ethylenediamino-tetraacetic acid, nitrilo-triacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, melitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acids and citric acid, tartrate mono succinate and tartrate di succinate.<br>
  In the context of organic builders, it is also desirable to incorporate polymers which are only partly dissolved in the aqueous continuous phase.  This allows a viscosity reduction (owing to the polymer which is dissolved whilst incorporating a sufficiently high amount to achieve a secondary benefit,<br>
   especially building, because the part which is not dissolved does not bring about the instability that would occur if substantially all were dissolved).  As for inorganic builders, the same restrictions apply with respect to the amount and volume fraction of non-dissolved polymer phase which can be<br>
   added while retaining substantial clarity.<br>
The incorporation of the soluble polymer permits formulation with improved stability at the same viscosity (relative to the structured composition without the soluble polymer) or lower<br>
   viscosity with the same stability.  The soluble polymer can also reduce viscosity drift, even when it also brings about a viscosity reduction.  Here, improved stability and lower viscosity mean over and above any such effects brought about by the deflocculating polymer.<br><br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
15<br>
The soluble polymer must have an average molecular weight of at least 1,000 but a minimum average molecular weight of 2,000 is preferred.<br>
  The use of partly soluble and the use of soluble polymers as referred to above in detergent compositions is described in our European patent specifications EP-A-301 882 and EP-A-301 883.<br>
Hydrotropes<br>
   It is also possible to incorporate minor amounts of hydrotropes such as lower alcohols (e.g. ethanol) or alkanolamines (e.g. triethanolamine), in order to ensure integrity of the lamellar dispersion we prefer that the structured compositions of the present invention are substantially free from hydrotropes.  By<br>
   hydrotrope is meant any water soluble agent which tends to enhance the solubility of surfactants in aqueous solution.<br>
Other Optional ingredients<br>
The compositions herein can further comprise a variety of  optional ingredients. A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, processing aids, dyes or pigments.  If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10-C16 alkanolamides can be 25 incorporated into the compositions, typically at 1 %- 10% levels. The C10-C 14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters. Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing; adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also 30 advantageous. If desired, soluble magnesium salts such as MgC12, MgS04, and the like, can be added at levels of,<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
16<br>
typically, 0.1%-2%,   to provide additional  suds  and to enhance grease removal performance.<br>
Various  detersive  ingredients employed in  the present    compositions  optionally can be  further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients  onto a porous hydrophobic substrate,   then coating said  substrate with a hydrophobic .coating.   Preferably,<br>
«<br>
the  detersive  ingredient  is  admixed with  a  surfactant before being absorbed  into the porous  substrate.   In use,   the detersive    ingredient  is  released from the substrate  into the aqueous washing  liquor,   where  it performs  its  intended detersive function.<br>
Chelating Agents<br>
    The detergent  compositions herein may also optionally contain one  or more  iron,   copper and/or manganese  chelating agents. Such chelating  agents  can be  selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates,   amino phosphonates,   polyfanctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents  and mixtures  therein,   all<br>
    as hereinafter defined.<br>
If utilized,   these  chelating agents  will  generally comprise from about  0.   1%  to about  10% by weight  of the detergent compositions  herein.   More preferably,   if    utilized,   the  chelating agents will  comprise  from about  0.1%  to about  3.0%  by weight  of  such compositions.<br>
Clay  Soil  Removal/Anti-redeposition Agents<br>
The  compositions  of the present  invention  can also optionally 30   contain water-   soluble  ethoxylated amines  having  clay soil removal  and  antiredeposition properties.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
17<br>
Liquid detergent compositions typically contain about 0.0 1% to about 5% of these agents.<br>
One preferred soil release and anti-redeposition agent is  ethoxylated tetraethylenepentamine. Exemplary ethoxylated amines are further described in U.S. Patent 4,597,898, Another type of preferred antiredeposition agent includes the carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) materials. These materials are well known in the art.<br><br>
Brightener<br>
Any optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents known in the art can be incorporated at levels typically from about 0.05% to about 1.2%, by weight, into the detergent<br>
   compositions herein. Commercial optical brighteners which may be useful in the present invention can be classified into subgroups, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, derivatives of stilbene, pyrazoline, cournarin, carboxylic acid, methinecyanines, dibenzothiphene-5,5-dioxide, azoles, 5-<br>
 and 6-membered- ring heterocycles, and other miscellaneous agents. Examples of such brighteners are disclosed in "The Production and Application of Fluorescent Brightening Agents", M. Zahradnik, Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1982).<br>
 Suds Suppressors<br>
Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in 30 U.S. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and infront-loading European-style washing machines.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
18<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors,<br>
and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7,<br>
  pages 430- 447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of<br>
suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses<br>
monocarboxylic fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S.<br><br>
 Patent 2,954,347. The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts<br>
thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl<br>
   chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18<br>
carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts<br>
such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and<br>
alkanolammonium. salts.<br>
   Although the soap in the present formulation also acts as a suds suppressor, the detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g., fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid<br>
   esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic C 1 8-C40 ketones (e.g., stearone), etc.<br>
The preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the<br>
   use of polyorganosiloxane oils, suchas polydimethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art gnd<br>
  are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,265,779.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
19<br>
For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine.<br>
 Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount" .<br>
By "suds suppressing amount" is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a 10 low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines.<br>
The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0.1% to about 5% of suds suppressor.<br>
 Enzymes<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry application. Enzymes are included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including<br>
 removal of protein-based, saccharide-based, or triglyceride-based stains, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer, and for fabric restoration. Suitable enzymes include proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal,<br>
   bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and<br>
   proteases, and fungal cellulases.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
20<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning,<br>
  stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or<br>
freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent<br>
  composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.0001% to 10%, preferably from 0.001% to 5%, more preferably 0.005%-l% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation.<br>
   Other than in the examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about". Similarly, all percentages are weight/weight percentages of the carbon dioxide unless<br>
 otherwise indicated. Where the term "comprising" is used in the specification or claims, it is not intended to exclude any terms, steps or features not specifically recited.<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the organic  substance is such that the in-use level is from 0.05 uM to 50 mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 1 to 100 pM.  Higher levels may be desired and applied in industrial bleaching processes, such as textile and paper pulp bleaching.<br><br>
WO 03/038029	PCT/EP02/11265<br>
21<br>
Preferably, the aqueous medium has a pH in the range from pH 6 to 13, more preferably from pH 6 to 11, and most preferably from 7 to 10.<br>
 The invention will now be further illustrated by way of the following non-limiting examples:<br>
