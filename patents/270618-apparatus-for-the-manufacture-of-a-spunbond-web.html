				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Description:<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the manufacture of a<br>
spunbond web, having a foraminous deposition belt onto which fibers for the<br>
spunbond web can be deposited. The fibers are particularly made of<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin, and preferably fibers, or continuous filaments<br>
made of thermoplastic synthetic resin. Generally and preferably, a suction<br>
device is provided under the foraminous deposition belt to suction air down<br>
through the foraminous deposition belt in the area where the fibers are<br>
deposited.<br>
An apparatus of the type described above is known in practice in<br>
various embodiments. The foraminous deposition belt is usually guided over<br>
several rollers so that there is substantial contact between the roller surfaces<br>
and the deposition belt. Once the fibers are deposited on the foraminous<br>
deposition belt, some of them are sucked through the foraminous deposition<br>
belt, e.g. between the warp and weft of the foraminous deposition belt. These<br>
are termed "throughshots." The known apparatus has in the transfer area of the<br>
spunbond web an output roller that normally is spanned over the deposition belt<br>
over a relatively large angle. In this output area, the spunbond web is usually<br>
transferred from the deposition belt to a calender in which the spunbond web is<br>
compacted. As a result of the corresponding continued movement of the<br>
spunbond web, the pinched fibers are torn off, and the torn-off fibers are freed<br>
to go into the air as fiber waste (so-called "snow"). The fibers remaining<br>
between the warp and weft threads of the foraminous deposition belt are<br>
pressed into and onto the foraminous deposition belt due to the interaction of<br>
the foraminous deposition belt with the rollers of the apparatus, thus forming<br><br>
undesired adhesion points for the spunbond web on the foraminous deposition<br>
belt. This contamination of the deposition belt has an adverse effect on the<br>
quality of the spun non-woven materials produced. In contrast, the object of<br>
invention is to provide an apparatus of the type mentioned above that avoids<br>
the previously mentioned disadvantages, and by means of which particularly the<br>
undesired fiber waste, or "snow," and the undesired contamination of the<br>
deposition belt can be prevented.<br>
In order to attain this object, the invention teaches an apparatus<br>
for the manufacture of a spunbond web, having a foraminous deposition belt,<br>
onto which fibers for the spunbond web can be deposited,<br>
wherein the foraminous deposition belt is guided across a roller,<br>
and the roller surface of the roller is profiled to have high spots such that the<br>
foraminous deposition belt is in moving contact only with the high spots of the<br>
roller surface.<br>
The invention provides for the deposition of fibers/filaments made<br>
of thermoplastic synthetic resin onto the foraminous deposition belt. According<br>
to one embodiment the fibers are continuous filaments. Preferably, the<br>
fibers/filaments are cooled and stretched, or aerodynamically stretched before<br>
they are deposited on the foraminous deposition belt. Advantageously, the<br>
fibers/filaments are guided through at least one diffuser before they are<br>
deposited on the foraminous deposition belt.<br>
Due to the shape of the roller surface according to the invention,<br>
high spots and low spots are present on the roller surface of the roller. The<br>
foraminous deposition belt is in contact only with partial areas of this roller<br>
surface, namely with the high spots.<br><br>
The foraminous deposition belt is generally guided across multiple<br>
rollers, or drive rollers, respectively. According to a very preferred embodiment<br>
having particularly great meaning to the invention, the profiled roller according<br>
to the invention is the output roller for the spunbond web. In this context, an<br>
output roller means that the spunbond web that is moved across the output<br>
roller is transferred in a travel direction downstream of the output roller to a<br>
processing device for the spunbond web, or to a further conveyor device<br>
(conveyor belt, deposition belt, or such). According to a very preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention the output roller surface of the output roller is also<br>
profiled, or equipped with the high spots and low spots. Advantageously, the<br>
output roller is simultaneously a drive roller for the drive of the foraminous<br>
deposition belt.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
the profiled roller, or the profiled output roller serves for output of the spunbond<br>
web to a calendar. Advantageously, the spunbond web subsequent to the<br>
movement across the output roller in the travel direction is therefore pulled by a<br>
calendar, or between two calendar rollers of a calendar downstream from the<br>
output roller.<br>
The invention provides that the foraminous deposition belt is<br>
spanned over the roller, preferably the output roller, through an angle of at least<br>
70°, preferably of at least 90°, and most preferably of at least 120°. According<br>
to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the foraminous<br>
deposition belt is spanned over the output roller profiled according to the<br>
invention through an angle of 125° to 145°, for example, through an angle of<br>
135°, or of about 135°.<br><br>
The invention further provides that at least 70%, preferably at<br>
least 80%, and particularly preferably at least 90% of the roller surface is<br>
profiled. This percentage of the surface area of the roller is therefore provided<br>
with the high spots and the low spots that alternate on the roller surface.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a uniform distribution of the high<br>
spots and the low spots is provided on the roller surface.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is<br>
characterized in that the profile of the roller surface is embodied in the form of<br>
grooves and ridges extending circumferentially around the roller outer surface.<br>
The ridges thus form the high spots, and the grooves form the low spots. In this<br>
recommended embodiment of the invention linear contact zones are thus<br>
formed between the roller and the foraminous deposition belt.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that<br>
the position of the contact points between the foraminous deposition belt and<br>
the roller continuously changes when the foraminous deposition belt is in<br>
motion, or with rotation of the roller, as a result of the shape of the roller. The<br>
invention also provides that the position of these contact points changes<br>
discontinuously due to the profile of the roller. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment, the profile is shaped like at least one screwthread. In this case,<br>
the previously mentioned ridges (high spots) and grooves (low spots) are<br>
integral parts of a thread having a certain pitch. Due to the pitch of the thread,<br>
the contact points continuously move between the roller surface and the<br>
foraminous deposition belt in an advantageous manner. According to a<br>
recommended embodiment, two screwthreads are provided on the roller, or on<br>
the profiled roller surface. Advantageously, each thread extends from the<br>
center of the roller (with regard to the longitudinal extension of the roller) to an<br><br>
end of the roller. Preferably, the first thread is a right-handed thread, and the<br>
second thread is a left-handed thread. The invention also provides that the<br>
ridges and grooves do not extend angularly around the entire circumference of<br>
the roller. This way, a discontinuous embodiment of the grooves in the roller<br>
surface is also possible.<br>
According to a recommended embodiment of the invention the<br>
depth t of the low spots, or the depth t of the grooves, respectively, is 0.05 to<br>
1.0 mm, preferably 0.05 to 0.6 mm, and most preferably 0.1 to 0.3 mm. The low<br>
spots or grooves provided on a roller may also have different depths t, or the<br>
depth t of a low spot or a groove can change along the low spot, or along the<br>
groove, in particularly, they may change continuously.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is<br>
characterized in that the profiled roller (macro-profile) also has a micro-profile<br>
on its surface. Preferably, the high spots of the profiled, or macro-profiled roller<br>
surfaces, also have a micro-profile on their surfaces. Advantageously, the<br>
surfaces making contact with the foraminous deposition belt of the ridges<br>
extending angularly at least partially around the circumference of the roller are<br>
micro-profiled. Preferably, the roller surface, or the surfaces of the high spots<br>
are profiled such that only point contact is made with the foraminous deposition<br>
belt. A reduction of the surface friction by up to 50% can be achieved with<br>
micro-profiling in an advantageous manner. Preferably, the micro-profiling is<br>
constituted as a globular surface topography. According to a recommended<br>
embodiment of the invention the micro-profiling of the roller surface, or of the<br>
high-spot regions is created by means of thermal spraying or galvanic coating.<br>
The invention provides that the micro-profile of the high spots have surfaces<br><br>
that are outwardly convex. According to a preferred embodiment the surface of<br>
the micro-high spots are shaped as tiny spheres and/or ellipsoids.<br>
With this shape of the roller, preferably of the output roller,<br>
according to the invention the disadvantages known from the previously<br>
discussed prior art can be effectively avoided. The invention is based on the<br>
knowledge that a contact-area reduction, or contact minimization between the<br>
foraminous deposition belt and the roller leads to the solution of the technical<br>
problem according to the invention. As explained above, a distinctly visible<br>
amount of the fibers is suctioned off (shot through) the foraminous deposition<br>
belt, or between the warp and weft of the foraminous deposition belt once the<br>
fibers are deposited on the foraminous deposition belt. Many known<br>
apparatuses provide an output roller that moves the foraminous deposition belt<br>
directly upstream from a calendar through an angle of about 135°. At this point,<br>
the spunbond web is transferred to the calendar, or to the calendar rollers. The<br>
shot-through filaments are pinched between the output roller surface and the<br>
foraminous deposition belt in the contact zone, and pulled opposite to the<br>
conveyor travel direction. The spunbond web in contrast is pulled by the<br>
calendar rollers and fed in the travel direction. If it is not possible to pull the<br>
shot-through and pinched filaments out of the deposition belt, the filaments tear<br>
off, and the above described fiber waste ("snow") is the result. The torn off<br>
fibers that are not removed as the "snow," and which therefore remain between<br>
the warp and weft of the deposition belt, are pressed into the foraminous<br>
deposition belt by the rollers of the machine so that they form adhesion points<br>
for the spunbond web on the foraminous deposition belt. As described above,<br>
this contamination of the foraminous deposition belt has an adverse effect on<br>
the quality of the spunbond web. The invention is now based on the knowledge<br><br>
that the effects described above, and the inherent disadvantages can be<br>
avoided, if the roller, preferably the output roller, is profiled according to the<br>
invention. Of significant importance is the profiling (macro-profiling) in the form<br>
of ridges and grooves extending across at least part of the circumference of the<br>
roller. A particularly preferred embodiment that has proven to be reliable in this<br>
regard is characterized in that the surfaces of the high spots (of the macro-<br>
profiling) are also micro-profiled. It should be noted that the embodiment of the<br>
roller/output roller according to the invention spunbond webs of significantly<br>
increased quality can be produced. It should also be emphasized that the<br>
measures according to the invention can be realized and relatively low expense<br>
and in a cost-effective manner. It is also not a problem to retrofit already<br>
existing systems with the rollers/output rollers according to the invention.<br>
The invention will be explained in further detail below, based on<br>
only one illustrated embodiment. Therein schematically:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematically simplified side view of an apparatus<br>
according to the invention,<br>
FIG. 2 is a top view of a roller, or an output roller according to the<br>
invention,<br>
FIG. 3 is an enlarged section of the object of FIG. 2, and<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a micro-profiled roller surface.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus for the manufacture of spun non-<br>
woven material, having a foraminous deposition belt 1 on which fibers 2 made<br>
of a thermoplastic synthetic resin can be deposited to make a spunbond web 3.<br>
The fibers 2 are preferably, and in the illustrated embodiment, continuous<br>
filaments. The foraminous deposition belt 1 is spanned across a roller, or an<br>
output roller 4 through an angle of about 135°. The spunbond web 3 is<br><br>
transferred to a calendar 5 in a travel direction downstream of the output roller<br>
4, or is pulled between two calendar rollers 6, 7.<br>
According to the invention the roller surface of the output roller 4 is<br>
formed with a profile (macro-profiling) that is made up of high spots and low<br>
spots. The foraminous deposition belt 1 spanned over the output roller 4 is in<br>
contact only with the high spots of the roller surface. According to a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment the profile (macro-profiling) of the roller surface is<br>
constituted by grooves 8 (low spots) and ridges 9 (high spots) that in the<br>
illustrated embodiment preferably extend angularly around the circumference of<br>
the output roller 4. This results in only line contact between the foraminous<br>
deposition belt 1 and the output roller 4.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the warp threads 10 of the foraminous deposition<br>
belt 1 above the roller surface of the output roller 4 macro-profiled with grooves<br>
8 and ridges 9 in an enlarged section. Fibers 2 suctioned through the<br>
foraminous deposition belt 1, or shot through, can be seen below the warp<br>
threads 10. Due to the macro-profiling of the roller surface with grooves 8 and<br>
ridges 9, only some of the shot-through filaments 2 are pinched between the<br>
foraminous deposition belt 1 and the output roller 4, namely only in the area of<br>
the ridges 9. FIG. 3 also shows that the diameter of the filaments 2 is<br>
substantially smaller than the diameter of the warp threads 10 of the foraminous<br>
deposition belt 1.<br>
Preferably, and according to the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
profiling (macro-profiling) of the output roller 4 is constituted as two<br>
screwthreads 11 and 12, each extending from the center of the output roller 4 to<br>
a respective outer end of the output roller 4. Advantageously, and according to<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the screwthreads 11 and 12 are of opposite hand.<br><br>
In the illustrated embodiment the screwthread 11 is a left-handed screwthread,<br>
and the screwthread 12 is a right-handed screwthread. Due to the screwthread<br>
formation, or due to the pitch of the profiling the shot-through filaments 2 are<br>
clamped between the foraminous deposition belt 1 and the ridges 9 only in two<br>
regions. At this point the points contact between the foraminous deposition belt<br>
1 and the output roller 4 continuously change with movement of the foraminous<br>
deposition belt 1, or with rotation of the output roller 4. Once the shot-through<br>
filaments 2 are no longer pinched, they can be further conveyed along with the<br>
remaining spunbond web 3 due to the tension of the calendar rollers 6 and 7. In<br>
this manner a tearing of the shot-through filaments 2, and therefore the<br>
disadvantageous "snow" can be avoided very effectively.<br>
According to a very preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
surfaces of the high spots of the profiling (macro-profiling) are also equipped<br>
with a micro-profiling 13. In the illustrated embodiment the outer surfaces of the<br>
ridges 9 have such a micro-profiling. Advantageously, and according to the<br>
illustrated embodiment, only point contact is formed between the foraminous<br>
deposition belt 1 and the output roller 4, or the ridges 9 by means of the surface<br>
structure constituted by the micro-profiling. Preferably, and according to the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the micro-profiling corresponds to a globular surface<br>
topography. The surfaces of the microscopic spots 14 are advantageously<br>
formed as tiny spheres and/or ellipsoids. The micro-profiling of the ridge<br>
surfaces can be created, for example, by means of thermal spraying or galvanic<br>
coating.<br><br>
