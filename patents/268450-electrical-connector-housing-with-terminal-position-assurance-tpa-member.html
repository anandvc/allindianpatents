DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] Referring to Fig- 1/ there is shown a perspective view of an electrical connector 10 incorporating features of the invention. Although the invention will be described with reference to the exemplary embodiment shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the invention can be embodied in many alternate forms of embodiments. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used,<br>
[0020]    The electrical connector 10 generally comprises a housing 12 and electrical contacts or terminals 14 (see Fig. 5) located inside the housing.  The terminals 14 are preferably female terminals,  such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,056,604 and 6,247,975 for example which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, However, any suitable terminal(s) could be provided.  The connector could also comprise additional components or members.    The  connector  10  is  adapted  to  removable connect electrical wires or conductors (not shown) to a mating electrical connector (not shown).   The front end 16 of the connector 10 is adapted to mate with the mating<br>
5<br><br><br>
electrical connector. A similar connector and mating connector are described in U.S. patent application No. 10/8 06,731 (US 2 005/0215106 Al) which is hereby incorporated by- reference in its entirety.<br>
[0021]    Referring  also  to  Fig.  2,  the  housing  12 generally comprises a first housing member 18  and a second housing member 20.   The first housing member 12 forms a majority of the housing.   The second housing member  2 0  forms  a  terminal  position  assurance  (TPA) member as well as part of the housing.   As further described below, the second housing member 20 is movably mounted to the first housing member 18 at the front end 16 between a forward unlocked position and a rearward locked position.  Fig, 1 shows the second housing member 2 0 in its rearward locked position.  The terminals 14 are attached to the wires (not shown) and then inserted into the first housing member 18 through the rear end of the first housing member 18*  The second housing member 20 is then moved from its forward unlocked position to its rearward locked position to thereby  assure  that  the terminals 14 are locked inside the housing 10.<br>
[0022] Referring also to Figs, 3 and 4, the first housing member 18 is preferably a one-piece molded plastic member. However, in alternate embodiments the first housing member could be comprised of multiple members, any suitable material(s) and/or could be formed by any suitable forming process. The first housing member 18 comprises a plurality of terminal receiving channels 22. The rear ends of the channels 22 are relatively  open  such  that  the  terminals  14  can  be<br><br><br>
inserted into the channels 22 through the rear end of the first housing member 18.<br>
[0023]    The first housing member 18 includes terminal locking fingers 24 which extend into each of the channels 22.  Each terminal locking fingers 24 comprises a forward projecting cantilevered deflectable section with a front facing latch surface 26.   The first housing member 18 includes overtravel protection sections 2 8 for each of the  terminal  locking  fingers  24.     The  over travel protection sections  28  are  located outward  from the terminal locking fingers 24 and spaced from the terminal locking fingers 24 by a gap 30 •   Open slots 32 are provided in the first housing member 18 between adjacent ones of the terminal locking fingers 24.   The slots 32 also partially open alternating adjacent ones of the channels 22 to each other,<br>
[0024] The terminal locking fingers 24 are adapted to resiliently deflect into the gaps 3 0 during insertion of the terminals 14 into the channels 22, As seen with reference to Fig. 5, the fingers 24 subsequently snap back to their home undeleted positions after the terminals are inserted with the latch surfaces 26 latched behind a portion of the terminals. This prevents the terminals 14 from inadvertently being pushed or pulled out of the-rear end of the channels 22,<br>
[0025] The front end of the first housing member 18 includes forward stop sections 34, The forward stop sections 34 have a general plus sign or cross ( + ) shape except at the lateral ends where the forward stop sections 34 have one-half general plus sign ( + ) or cross shapes.   The full plus sign  ( + )  shaped forward stop<br>
7<br><br>
sections 34 are located at the front of four of the channels 22.  The one-half plus sign (+) shaped forward stop sections 34 are located at the front of two of the channels 22; the two channels at each lateral end of the rows.  As seen with reference to Fig. 5, the back sides 3 6 of the forward stop sections 34 form stop surfaces to limit  forward  movement  of  the  terminals  14  in  the channels 22.  The back sides of the forward stop sections 34 are only located on two of the sides of each channel. The front  sides  3 8  of  the  forward stop sections  34 comprise  sloped  surfaces  as  lead-ins  for  the  male contacts of the mating electrical connector (not shown) into the channels 22 and terminals 14.<br>
[0026]    Referring also to Figs,  6 and 1,     the second housing member or TPA member 2 0 is preferably a one-piece molded plastic member.  However, in alternate embodiments the second housing member could be comprised of multiple members, any suitable material(s) and/or could be formed by any suitable forming process.   The second housing member 2 0 comprises a front end 4 0 and rearward extending sections 42.   The front end 40 includes general box shaped openings 44 with columns 4 6 located between the openings 44.  The columns 46 have front faces with sloped lead-in surfaces as lead-ins for the male contacts of the mating electrical connector (not shown) into the channels 22 and terminals 14.   The front faces of the second housing member 2 0 also includes top and bottom sloped surfaces at the top and bottoms of the openings 44,  When the second housing member 2 0  is moved to its locked position as seen in Fig, 1, the sloped surfaces of the two housing members 18,  2 0 combine to form square or rectangular funnel shapes into the channels 2 2 at the<br>
8<br><br>
front of the connector, Pogo style electrical testing holes 48 are located above and below the openings 44 to allow an electrical testing probe (not shown) to be inserted into the housing to test the terminals 14. As seen with reference to Pig. 8, the rear side of the front end 40 forms stop surfaces for limiting forward movement of the terminals 14 in the channels 22 when the second housing member 20 is located at its locked position, but only on two sides of each channel 22.<br>
[0027]    The  rearward  extending  sections  42  include rearward extending cantilevered channel separator wall sections 50 and rearward extending cantilevered blocking sections 52,   The wall sections 50 are adapted to be located in the slots 32 of the first housing member 18. The wall sections 50 can slide in the slots 32,  When the second housing member 20 is at its locked position, the wall sections 50 cooperate with the first housing member 18 to separate at least some of the adjacent channels 22 from each other.   By allowing portions of the second housing member 2 0 to be used to separate at least some of the channels 22 from each other (rather than only the first housing member) the overall size of the connector 10 can be reduced.  In the embodiment shown, the lateral side walls of the channels 22 are provided either by the first housing member 18 and alternatingly by portions of the first housing member 18 and the wall sections 50 of the second housing member 20.   Alternatively, the wall sections of the second housing member could form the alternating channels walls entirely.<br>
[0028]    Referring also to Figs, 9-12, when the second housing member 2 0 is initially inserted into the first<br><br><br>
housing member 18, the blocking sections 52 are located in the areas just forward of the gaps 30; partially covered by the overtravel protection sections 28. When the second housing member 20 is moved to it locked position, the blocking sections 52 slide into the gaps 30, If any of the terminals 14 are not fully inserted into the channels 22, their respective locking finger 24 will prevent insertion of the blocking section 52 into the gap. This can signal the installer that there is a terminal which is not fully inserted.<br>
[0029] When the blocking sections 52 are moved into the gaps 30, the blocking sections prevent or block outward deflection of the locking fingers 24 , Because the locking fingers 24 are prevented from deflecting outward by the blocking sections 52, the locking fingers 24 cannot be inadvertently moved and they positively prevent the terminals 14 from being pushed or pulled out of the rear ends of the channels. Thus, the blocking sections 52 provide locking finger reinforcement,<br>
[003 0]    With the embodiment shown in the drawings, the first housing member or terminal block 18 defines two partial, right angle walls of each cavity leading into the channels 22 and the terminals 14,  The TPA member 20 defines the rest of the cavity leaking into the channels 22 and the terminals 14; including the other two partial, right angle walls of each cavity.  The two partial, right angle walls of the first housing member 18 help prevent the terminals 14 from popping out of the front end of the first housing member 18 prior to insertion of the TPA member 2 0.  Once   the TPA member 2 0 is inserted; the two members 18, 2 0 define a 3 6 0 contact stop surface at the<br><br>
front of the channels 22.  In addition, the TPA member 20 defines a portion of each alternating channel wall.  By putting portions of the channel walls on the TPA member 20, there is more space in the first housing member for insertion of the terminals 14 and wider flexible locking fingers 24.  More space in the first housing member for insertion of the terminals 14 allows larger terminals or less likelihood of clearance problems when inserting the terminals.  Wider flexible locking fingers 24 can provide stronger finger which are less likely to fail, and can latch with the terminals better,  such as due  to an increased area of contact between the terminal and the locking finger.<br>
[0031] In conclusion, the terminal block 18 may define cavities with an open top or bottom wall, one or more partial sidewalls, and a flexible finger 24 adjacent the open wall. The TPA member 20 completes the missing walls or wall portions instead of the terminal block 18. This permits the locking fingers 24 to be made larger.<br>
