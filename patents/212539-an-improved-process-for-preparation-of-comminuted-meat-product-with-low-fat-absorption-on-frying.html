				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of comminuted meat product with low fat absorption on frying. The invention, in particular, relates to the preparation of comminuted buffalo meat product with low fat absorption on frying in palm oil.<br>
Ground or emulsion type products with low fat content have drawn the attention of meat industry for the reasons of health of consumers, efficient use of tough meats, and possible reduction in product cost due to the addition of extenders/binders such as legumes &amp; oilseed derivatives while maintaining nutritional and sensory qualities.<br>
India is a largest reservoir of buffaloes (Â« 100 million) in the world. In India buffaloes are slaughtered after their productive period and meat from such animals, being tough, can be effectively utilized for the production of convenience type of comminuted meat products. This will promote meat industry by improving domestic as well as export market. Attempts have been made to prepare low-fat meat products and their quality evaluated.<br>
Reference may be made to Berry &amp; Signer (Food Res Intl 29, 355-362, 1996) wherein carragenan is incorporated in the preparation of restructured pork nuggets. Lowest fat content of 9.1% and highest yield of 86.9% of precooked &amp; reheated nugget was obtained with the addition of 0.38% and 0.25% iota carragenan respectively. The use of this fat - replacer, did not improve the cooking or sensory properties compared with the all-pork product. The draw backs are the low yields of the product on precooking &amp; reheating, reduction of only 2.1% fat content in the treated nugget and the use of unconventional and expensive ingredient in meat product.<br>
Reference may be made to Prinyawiwatkul et al (J Agric Food Chem 45, 1891-1899, 1997) wherein chicken nuggets of sensorily acceptable quality equivalent to control were made by adding 2.5% of fermented cowpea and 2.5% of fermented partially defatted peanuts as extenders. The drawback is fermentation of extenders for long period of 21-22h using starter culture of R. microporous var. oligosporus (tempeh mold) which is difficult commercially and substantially adds to the cost of extenders.<br>
Reference may be made to Singh et al (J Food Sci Technol 34, 316-319, 1997) wherein chicken nuggets of higher cooking yield (96.6%), lower frying loss (5.3%), improved cohesiveness and organoleptic quality were prepared by incorporating optimized quantity (1%) of Sodium and Calcium caseinate. Several other ingredients added to deboned chicken (spent hen) meat (55%) were skin, gizzard and hearts mix (15%), chicken fat (10%), salt (1.7%), sugar (0.5%), condiments (3.8%), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (0.5%) and sodium nitrate (0.15%). The drawbacks are use of chemicals such as tetrasodium pyrophosphate and sodium nitrate, use of higher quantities of condiments to overcome the bland flavor imparted by caseinates and high cost of caseinates. Reference may be made to US patent nr 5683738-Nov 1997 by Gruetzmacher et al (Low calorie fat substitute) wherein normally present triglyceride was partially replaced by a low calorie fat substitute comprising a sorbitol fatty acid ester without causing significant gastrointestinal symptoms when the foodstuff is consumed. The drawbacks are need for alkali metal catalyst and precise process conditions for preparing a mixture of sorbitol fatty acid esters, and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of these esters in food stuffs.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent nr 5773057 - June 1998 by Singh (Low-fat ground meat products) wherein a fermented ground meat product comprising 95 - 40% ground meat, 5-60% thermo-irreversible milk protein gel having an appearance and texture that mimics the appearance and texture of adipose tissue and an effective amount of an acid-producing bacteria. Other additives required for preparation of the product are 0.1 -1.0 % (based on the weight of the hydrolysed milk protein gel) and 0.2 - 2.0 % (based on the weight of ground meat) gelatin. The products, viz. fermented sausages, had fat contents ranging from 5-35 %. The drawbacks are needs of expensive ingredients like thermo-irreversible milk of precise particle size, gelatin and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) and in addition carefully controlled fermentation steps using appropriate acid - producing bacteria.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent nr 5895677 - April 1999 by Lai (Low-fat meat foods and methods for making the same) wherein a ground meat product containing 5-50% of thermo-irreversible starch gel having a texture that mimics the texture of adipose tissue. The fat content of the product was in the range of 5 - 10%. The drawbacks are the need for expensive compound, viz., thermo-irreversible starch gel of precise particle size.<br>
However, no information is available in the literature on the use of natural binders such as legume flour for producing the comminuted meat products having low fat absorption on frying.<br>
The main object of the present invention is an improved process for preparation of comminuted meat product with low fat absorption on frying, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use an appropriate legume flour as a binder, which causes minimal absorption of fat on frying.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to increase the yield and minimize the shrinkage of the product on frying.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to prevent cracking of the product and retain the shape of the product intact during frying.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to produce a product with improved sensory quality.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of comminuted meat product with low fat absorption on frying which comprises :<br>
a)	dividing meat chunks into 2 lots,<br>
b)	cooking one lot of deboned meat chunks in steam,<br>
c)	mixing the above said partially cooked meat chunks and remaining uncooked<br>
meat chunks and mincing it together using a mincer,<br>
d)	adding 8-9 weight% grated onion, 1-2 weight% ginger, 1-2 weight% garlic, 0.3-<br>
0.5 weight% black pepper powder and 2-3 weight% common salt to the above<br>
said minced meat and mixing them in a mixer,<br>
e)	mixing 6-8 weight% roasted Blackgram dhal flour with the above said mixture of<br>
meat mince and spices along with the cooked out juice to obtain a batter mix,<br>
f)	shaping the above batter mix in a circular disc and<br>
g)	rolling the above said disc in bread crumb, followed by frying the coated product<br>
in refined vegetable oil to obtain the desired ready-to-eat comminuted meat<br>
product.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the source of meat used may be selected from the group consisting of chicken, pork, sheep and goat.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the frying vegetable oil used may be selected from palm oil and groundnut oil.<br>
The optimized ingredient composition is given in the formulation and the process of preparation of ready-to-eat product is presented in the flow chart.<br>
Formulation:<br>
Buffalo meat - deboned	10 kg<br>
Roasted black-gram dhal powder	800 g<br>
Onion	850 g<br>
Ginger	150g<br>
Garlic	160g<br>
Black pepper powder	40 g<br>
Salt	250 g<br>
Bread crumb (for coating)	500 g<br>
Flours from legumes such as soyabean, bengal gram, green gram, black<br>
gram dhals etc are used in variety of comminuted meat products such as cutlets, kofta, burger, tikka, nuggets, etc. These ingredients serve as binders and/or extenders and reduce the product cost while maintaining/improving the nutritive and sensory quality of the product. Use of carragenan and sorbitol fatty acid esters as fat replacers, fermented cowpea and fermented partially defatted peanuts as extenders, caseinate salts, milk protein gels and starch gels as binders have been attempted by many authors in order to produce a ground meat/emulsion type product of acceptable quality. These ingredients require preprocessing and are not normally used in meat products and further, they are quite expensive. Meat industry world over is looking for use of natural ingredients in order to achieve the objective of producing a product with low fat while maintaining/improving the nutritional and sensory quality.<br><br>
FLOW DIAGRAM<br>
(FLOW DIAGRAM REMOVED)<br><br>
The novelty of the present invention are:<br>
a.	Low fat absorption on deep fat frying of ground meat product by using<br>
partially roasted black gram dhal.<br>
b.	Retention of shape of the product during frying due to the use of a portion<br>
of partially cooked meat instead of totally uncooked meat while preparing a<br>
batter.<br>
c.	Improvement of sensory quality of the product prepared by using binder of<br>
appropriate quantity and quality.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Deboned buffalo meat procured from local market was brought to the laboratory, cleaned in tap water, facia and trimmable fat removed by knife and 1 kg of chunks (1-2 inch size) were used for the work. 750 g of chunks were placed in a SS vessel and steamed in cooker at atmospheric pressure for 10 min. The 460 g cooked meat chunks and 260 g cooked out juice were separated by draining and juice preserved for use in batter making. Cooked as well as remaining 250 g of uncooked meat chunks were mixed and passed through 4 mm die in meat mincer to obtain minced meat. Along side, dhal from legumes viz., soya bean (Glycine max. merr.), bengal gram (Cicer arientum), green gram (Phaseolus aureus Roxb) or black gram (Phaseolus mungo) were roasted on a open pan at 150Â°C for 5 min, cooled and powdered in mill. To the minced meat were added 80 g of roasted or un-roasted black gram flour, 85 g grated onion, 16<br>
g grated garlic, 15 g grated ginger, 4 g black pepper powder, 25 g common salt<br>
and 130 g cooked out juice. The ingredients were then mixed thoroughly in a Mixer for 2 min to obtain 1050 g of batter mix of appropriate consistency. A batch of six pieces of 50 g each of batter mix shaped into circular disc were rolled in to bread crumb and fried in 500 ml oil at 155Â°C for 8 min to obtain ready-to-eat comminuted meat product. The % yield of the fried product was determined by weighing the shaped batter mix before and after frying. The % shrinkage is determined by measuring the diameter of shaped batter mix before and after frying. The fat content in the product before and after frying was measured by extraction in petroleum ether (40 - 60Â°C) in Soxtec apparatus and fat absorbed determined and expressed as % total fat in the raw (un-fried) batter mix.<br>
The Circular disc shaped product after frying was subjected to sensory quality evaluation. The organoleptic attributes, viz., flavor, texture, juiciness and overall quality were measured by 8 in-house semi-trained panelists by hedonic scale, viz., 0 = least desirable and 10 = most desirable. The mean score for each attribute is reported.<br>
The results presented in Table 1A clearly reveal that fat absorption is 26.6% with un-roasted and 25.0% with roasted black gram dhal powder and that these values are lower compared to the other legume flours. Use of roasted black gram flour resulted into highest product yield (95.8%) and lowest shrinkage in diameter (5.0%), as presented in Table 1B.<br>
Highest sensory scores for flavour (8.6), texture (8.5), juiciness (7.9) and overall quality (8.3) were recorded for fried samples prepared by using roasted black gram dhal as binder (Table 1C).<br>

Example 2<br>
Deboned buffalo meat chunks (2kg) were washed and divided into two lots of 1.5 kg and 0.5 kg. 1.5 kg chunks were steamed for 12 min cooked meat (950 g) and cooked out juice (450 g) separated. Cooked meat and the remaining 0.5 kg of uncooked meat were mixed and minced to which were added 160 g flour from roasted (at 155Â°C for 8 min) or un-roasted legume dhal, 170 g onion, 30 g ginger, 32 g garlic, 8g black pepper powder, 50 g common salt as well as 260 g cooked out juice. The ingredients were then mixed for 3 min to obtain approx. 2100 g of batter mix. A batch of 6 pieces of 50g each batter mix shaped in to a circular disc and rolled into bread crumb was fried in 500ml palm oil at 160Â°C for 10 min. The product yield, shrinkage, fat absorbed and sensory quality attributes were determined as detailed in example 1.<br>
Table 2A. Effect of binders on absorption of fat in meat product during frying (Fat content in meat product, g /100 g)<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results of Table 2A indicate that roasted flours yielded product with lower amount of fat absorbed compared to un-roasted flour counterparts and that among the roasted legume flours the lowest fat absorption (27.7%) was noticed in product prepared using black gram dhal flour. Similarly the frying yield was<br>
highest (95.8%) and shrinkage lowest (5.1%) (Table 2B) and sensory attributes were rated highest (Table 2C) for the product made from roasted black gram dhal flour.<br>

Example 3<br>
Deboned buffalo meat free from trimmable fat and facia (3 kg) was divided into 2 parts of 2.25 kg and 0.75 kg. The 2.25 kg portion was steamed for 15 min<br>
and cooked out juice (0.7kg) separated. Cooked meat (1.4 kg) as well as 0.75 kg uncooked meat chunks were minced and to the mince were added 240 g flour from un-roasted or roasted (at 160Â°C for 10 min) legume dhal, 255 g onion, 45 g ginger, 48 g garlic, 12 g black pepper powder, 75 g common salt and 390 g cooked out juice. The ingredients were mixed in a Mixer for 4 min to obtain 3.1 Kg batter mix. A batch of 6 pieces of 50 g each batter mix shaped into circular discs and rolled into bread crumb was fried in 500 ml palm oil at 160Â°C for 10 min. The product yield, fat absorption, shrinkage as well as sensory quality attributes of the fried product were determined as explained in example 1.<br>
As in the previous examples, the lowest fat absorption (24.3%) (Table 3A), highest frying yield (95.8%) and least shrinkage (5%) (Table 3B) and highest rating for sensory quality attributes (Table 3C) were registered for the product prepared using roasted black gram dhal.<br>

Example 4<br>
Deboned buffalo meat (5 kg) free from trimmable fat and facia was divided into two parts, viz., 3.75 kg and 1.25 kg. 3.75 kg meat chunks were steamed for 15 min and cooked out juice (1.6 kg) separated. Cooked meat chunks (2.6 kg)<br>
and 1.25 kg uncooked meat chunks were together minced. To the minced meat were added 400 g flour from un-roasted or roasted (at 160Â°C for 10 min) dhal from legumes, 425 g onion, 75 g ginger, 80 g garlic, 20 g black pepper powder, 125 g common salt and 0.65 kg cooked out juice. These ingredients were mixed in a mixer for 5 min to obtain 5.5 kg batter mix. A batch of 6 pieces of 50g each batter mix shaped into circular disc rolled into bread crumb was fried in palm oil at 160Â°C for 12 min. The product yield, fat absorbed, shrinkage in diameter on frying and sensory attributes of fried product were evaluated as detailed in example 1.<br>
As observed before, the lowest fat absorption (27.4%) (Table 4A), highest frying yield (95.8%), least shrinkage (5.1%) (Table 4B) and highest rating for all sensory quality attributes (Table 4C) were noticed for the product containing roasted black gram dhal flour as binder.<br>

The circular shaped batter mix coated with bread crumb developed cracks on the edges and did not retain the shape during frying when only raw meat (without partial cooking of a portion) was used in the process. However, the circular shape of the product was retained intact when about V* th quantity of buffalo meat was partially cooked and about half the quantity cooked out juice was used in the preparation of batter mix. Legume powders prepared from<br><br>
roasted dhals resulted into lower fat absorption in product on frying compared to the use of legume powders from un-roasted dhals. However, black gram dhal powder, produced a product with least fat absorption on frying. This could, possibly, be due to the substantially higher content of non-starch polysaccharide mucilage (a long chain carbohydrate) in black gram dhals compared to other dhals studied. Further, the fat absorption on frying was lowest when black gram dhal was roasted, prior to use as a binder. This could be due to partial modification of starch and non-starch polysaccharides present in binder which may hinder the absorption of fat. Thus this invention provides an improved process for preparation of comminuted meat product with low fat absorption during frying which comprises steam cooking of %th quantity of meat chunks for<br>
10	min at atmospheric pressure, mincing together of cooked as well as %th<br>
quantity of uncooked  meat chunks,  mixing of meat mince with optimized<br>
quantities of onion, garlic, ginger, black pepper powder, common salt, roasted<br>
black gram dhal powder and half the quantity of cooked out juice to prepare a<br>
batter mix of appropriate consistenacy, preparing circular disc shaped batter<br>
product of about 50 g each, coating the disc with bread crumb and frying in palm<br>
011	to obtain a ready-to-eat comminuted meat product.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.	Black gram flour is a natural ingredient and can be used in meat product<br>
as an effective binder.<br>
2.	Roasting of black gram dhal is quite simple and use of flour from roasted<br>
legume reduces fat absorption of comminuted meat product during frying.<br>
3.	Yield of product is higher and product shrinkage is lower on frying of the<br>
product.<br>
4.	The comminuted meat product with additives does not break and retains<br>
its shape during frying.<br>
5.	The product has high scores for organoleptic attributes such as flavor,<br>
texture, juiciness and overall quality.<br>
6.	The process is easily adaptable in the existing industry manufacturing<br>
varieties of meat products.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.	An improved process for the preparation of comminuted meat product with<br>
low fat absorption on frying which comprises :<br>
a)	dividing meat chunks into 2 lots,<br>
b)	cooking one lot of deboned meat chunks in steam,<br>
c)	mixing the above said partially cooked meat chunks and remaining uncooked<br>
meat chunks and mincing it together using a mincer,<br>
d)	adding 8-9 weight% grated onion, 1-2 weight% ginger, 1-2 weight% garlic, 0.3-<br>
