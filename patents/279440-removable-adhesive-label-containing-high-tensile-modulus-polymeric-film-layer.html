				<td>REMOVABLE ADHESIVE LABEL CONTAINING<br>
HIGH TENSILE MODULUS POLYMERIC FILM LAYER<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
61/164,694 filed March 30, 2009, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention involves a removable adhesive label that contains a high<br>
tensile modulus polymeric film, a related labeled container, and a method of removing the label from a<br>
container. The label is useful in various labeling applications and especially in adhesive labeling<br>
applications involving reusable and recyclable containers.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Labels are applied to numerous articles of commerce to convey information<br>
regarding a manufacturer and a product. Articles of commerce include plastic, paper, metal and glass<br>
containers for a multitude of consumer and industrial products such as for example bottled beverage<br>
industry products. A particularly demanding labeling application is for reusable and recyclable beverage<br>
bottles, especially for the bottled beer industry, where the label requirements generally include high<br>
 <br>
clarity visual aesthetics, abrasion resistance during processing and handling of beverage bottles,<br>
resistance to any deleterious effects due to moisture during cold storage or a pasteurization process,<br>
and removability of the label from the bottle during a washing process in a warm or hot washing fluid<br>
such as for example a 50 to 90°C aqueous caustic solution where the removed label does not clog the<br>
washing process equipment. The washing process allows the washed bottle to consequently be reused<br>
or recycled. The washed bottle offers the flexibility of being refilled and relabeled for any number of<br>
beverage products. Labels currently employed for reusable and recyclable beverage bottles include<br>
paper labels and stretched, thermally shrinkable polymeric labels. Paper labels lack high clarity visual<br>
aesthetics. Stretched, thermally shrinkable polymeric labels upon removal tend to curl up tightly into a<br>
needle shape which can clog washing process equipment. Labels meeting the requirements for the<br>
reusable and recyclable bottled beverage industry are desirable.<br>

abrasion or moisture resistant material to include for example a polyolefin or polyester where the<br>
coating can be applied in a liquid form and dried or allowed to dry.<br>
Label Processing<br>
[0051] The film and label of the present invention can be prepared by one or more steps<br>
that include steps selected from the group consisting of an extrusion of a single layer, a coextrusion of<br>
two or more layers, a lamination of two or more layers, an application of one or more coatings, and a<br>
combination of two or more of any of the foregoing steps. The extrusion or coextrusion steps can be<br>
done through linear dies or annular dies. In an embodiment the film is monolayered and contains a<br>
monolayered first film layer which is formed by an extrusion step. In embodiments the film is<br>
multilayered and contains a multilayered first film layer which is formed by a coextrusion step, by a<br>
combination of extrusion and lamination steps, or by a combination of extrusion and coextrusion and<br>
 <br>
lamination steps. In other embodiments the film is multilayered and contains a first film layer and a<br>
second film layer where the first film layer can be monolayered or multilayered and the second film<br>
layer can be monolayered or multilayered. The second film layer can be formed separately from the<br>
first film layer or together with the first film layer by one or more steps as described above for the film,<br>
label, and the monolayered and multilayered first film layer. In an embodiment a multilayered film<br>
contains a two-layered first film layer where each of the two layers is formed by an extrusion step and<br>
then the first film layer is formed by a lamination step. The lamination can be done by bringing layers<br>
together usually under pressure with or without heat and with or without a lamination adhesive.<br>
Lamination adhesives include for example polyurethane based adhesives and acrylic based adhesives<br>
such as acrylic based permanent pressure sensitive adhesives. In an embodiment the lamination is done<br>
by bringing layers together at a pressure of 69 to 690 KPa (kilopascals) at an ambient temperature of<br>
23°C with a lamination adhesive, a polyurethane based adhesive, between the layers. In an<br>
embodiment a multilayered film contains a monolayered first film layer and a monolayered second film<br>
layer where each layer is formed by an extrusion step and then the multilayered film is formed by a<br>
lamination step. In an embodiment a multilayered film contains a multilayered first film layer that<br>
contains six layers where five of the layers are formed by a coextrusion step, the sixth layer is formed by<br>
an extrusion step, and the multilayered film is formed by lamination of the coextruded layers with the<br>
extruded layer.<br>
[0052] In an embodiment the film is nonoriented or not stretched. In other embodiments<br>
the film is oriented or stretched uniaxially in one direction, which can be the machine direction or the<br>
transverse direction, or the film is oriented biaxially in two directions which are usually the machine<br>
direction and the transverse direction. Orienting or stretching is stretching the film or layers of the film<br>
to align the polymer chains of the thermoplastic polymer or polymers, present in the film or layers of<br>
the film, in the direction of the stretching. The stretching results in the film or layers of the film having<br>
 <br>
an increase in length and consequently a decrease in thickness. Although the stretching can be done at<br>
any temperature, it is usually done at an elevated temperature near the softening temperature of the<br>
polymer or polymers. The stretching generally increases the stiffness or tensile modulus (ASTM D882)<br>
of the film or layers of the film in the direction of the stretching. In embodiments the film or layers of<br>
the film can be oriented by stretching them uniaxially or biaxially in a stretch ratio range of 2 to 12, 3 to<br>
10, or 4 to 8 where the stretch ratio is the ratio of the film length after stretching to the film length<br>
before stretching. In order to provide dimensional stability to an oriented film or layers of the film so<br>
they do not shrink or distort appreciably especially when exposed to elevated temperatures, the<br>
oriented film or layers of the film are annealed or heat set by heating the tensioned film or layers of the<br>
film near the softening temperature of the constituent polymer or polymers. In embodiments the<br>
annealed film or layers of the film have a linear shrinkage (ASTM D1204) at 100°C in the machine<br>
direction and the transverse direction of less than 5%, less than 4.9%, less than 4.8%, or less than 3%. In<br>
an embodiment the film is a monolayered film and has only one layer. In an embodiment the film is a<br>
multilayered film and has two or more layers. In embodiments the first film layer is monolayered where<br>
the first film layer is nonoriented or is oriented and annealed. In embodiments the multilayered film<br>
contains a multilayered first film layer where the multilayered first film layer has two or more layers<br>
where all the layers of the first film layer are nonoriented, all the layers of the first film layer are<br>
oriented and annealed, or part of the layers of the first film layer are oriented and annealed where part<br>
of the layers of the first film layer includes at least one layer of the first film layer but not all the layers of<br>
the first film layer. In embodiments the multilayered film has a first film layer and a second film layer<br>
where both the first film layer and second film layer are monolayered, both the first film layer and<br>
second film layer are multilayered, the first film layer is monolayered and the second film layer is<br>
multilayered, or the first film layer is multilayered and the second film layer is monolayered. The<br>
monolayered or multilayered second film layer can be nonoriented or oriented and annealed as<br>
 <br>
described above for the monolayered and multilayered first film layer. In an embodiment, referring to<br>
Figures 1A, IB, 1C, ID and IE the label has a thickness T which includes the thickness of the first film<br>
layer TFFL and the thickness of the adhesive layer TAl, or the thickness of the first film layer TFFL, the<br>
thickness of the second film layer TSFL and the thickness of the adhesive layer TAL, or the thickness of the<br>
first film layer TFFL, the thickness of the second film layer TifLl the thickness of the tie layer TTL or the<br>
lamination adhesive layer TLAL and the thickness of the adhesive layer TAL. The film has a thickness which<br>
is the thickness of the first film layer TFFL, or includes the thickness of the first film layer TFFL and the<br>
thickness of the second film layer TSFU or includes the thickness of the first film layer TFFlj the thickness<br>
of the second film layer TSFL and the thickness of the tie layer TTL or the lamination adhesive layer T^. In<br>
embodiments the thickness in micrometers of the film and the first film layer TFFLcan range from 5 to<br>
254, 6 to 127, or 7 to 63.5. In embodiments the first film layer, the second film layer, the tie layer and<br>
the lamination adhesive layer can each have a thickness, respectively TFFL and TSFL and TTL and TUL, in<br>
micrometers ranging from 1.7 to 85, 2 to 42, or 2.3 to 21.<br>
[0053] The film can be treated on one surface or both of its surfaces to enhance<br>
performance to include abrasion resistance, moisture resistance, and adhesion of an ink or adhesive to a<br>
surface or surfaces of the film. Surface treatments include a corona discharge treatment, a flame<br>
treatment, a plasma treatment, a topcoat treatment, or combinations of two or more of any of the<br>
foregoing treatments. Topcoat treatments include treatment of one or both surfaces of the film with an<br>
ink-receptive or adhesive-receptive material such as for example an acrylic primer and/or with a<br>
protective varnish. The treatments can be done any time during the manufacture and subsequent<br>
processing of the film and label where the time of the treatment generally depends on the performance<br>
enhancement. For example a treatment to enhance ink reception would precede a printing step while a<br>
topcoating for abrasion resistance might follow a printing step. In an embodiment the first surface or<br>
the second surface of the film is surface treated to enhance adhesion of an ink to the film. In an<br>
 <br>
embodiment the second surface of the film is surface treated to enhance adhesion of an adhesive to the<br>
film. In an embodiment the first surface of the film is surface treated to enhance abrasion resistance<br>
and/or moisture resistance of the film.<br>
[0054] In several embodiments the label includes a film, an adhesive layer, and a release<br>
liner. The label of the present invention can be prepared in any manner. In an embodiment a film or<br>
one or more film layers can be slit into widths suitable for subsequent processing steps or labeling<br>
operations. In embodiments the film can be coated with an adhesive to form an adhesive layer and<br>
then the film and adhesive layer can be combined in a lamination step with a release liner, or a release<br>
liner can be coated with an adhesive to form an adhesive layer and then the release liner and adhesive<br>
layer can be combined in a lamination step with the film. The label containing a film, adhesive layer and<br>
release liner can be further processed to include printing steps and/or die-cutting steps. In an<br>
embodiment the label, containing a film and adhesive layer and release liner&gt; can be printed using any<br>
printing means and using any printing ink. Printing means include for example offset lithography,<br>
flexographic, digital, thermal, inkjet and laser. Printing inks include for example water-based inks,<br>
solvent-based inks and UV-activated inks. Alternatively in another embodiment a film or a film layer can<br>
be printed prior to eventually combining with an adhesive layer or with an adhesive layer and release<br>
liner as described above. In embodiments the film is monolayered or multilayered and has a first outer<br>
surface and a second outer surface where the first outer surface of the film has a print layer or the<br>
second outer surface of the film has a print layer which can also have an adhesive layer adhesively<br>
joined to the print layer. In an embodiment the film is multilayered and has two or more layers where a<br>
print layer is located between the layers of the film. In an embodiment the film is multilayered and has<br>
a first film layer and a second film layer where either the first film layer or the second film layer is<br>
printed and then the first film layer and the second film layer are combined in a lamination step where a<br>
print layer is located between the first film layer and second film layer. In an embodiment a label<br>
 <br>
containing a printed or nonprinted film, adhesive layer and release liner is die-cut using any die-cutting<br>
means, to include for example a rotary cutting die, where as a result of the die-cutting a die-cut ladder-<br>
shaped matrix of the film and adhesive layer is formed that contains a series of individual labels on the<br>
release liner which acts as a carrier for the labels. This die-cut series of labels can then be used to label<br>
articles in a labeling process where individual labels are successively removed from the release liner and<br>
the die-cut ladder-shaped matrix. Processing to include extrusion, coextrusion, orienting, annealing,<br>
coating, surface treatments, label construction, printing, die-cutting and labeling of articles is further<br>
described in US Patent Nos. US 7,217,463 to Henderson and US 7,144,542 to Holzer et al.<br>
