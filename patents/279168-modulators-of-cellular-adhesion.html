Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of general formula (I), capable of modulating<br>
interactions between CAMs and leukointegrins. It also relates to pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the compounds which are useful as modulators of the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion<br>
molecules. Thus these compounds are useful, for example, for the treatment of various LFA-1 -<br>
related disorders including immune and/or inflammatory disorders.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Research conducted over the last decade has helped elucidate the molecular events<br>
attending cell-cell interactions in the body, especially those events involved in the movement and<br>
activation of cells in the immune system. See generally, Springer, T. Nature, 1990, 346, 425-<br>
434. Cell surface proteins, and especially the Cellular Adhesion Molecules ("CAMs") and<br>
"leukointegrins", including LFA-1, MAC-1 and gpl50.95 (referred to as CD18/CDlla,<br>
CD18/CDllb, and CD18/CDllc, respectively) have correspondingly been the subject of<br>
pharmaceutical research and development having as its goal the intervention in the processes of<br>
leukocyte extravasation to sites of injury and leukocyte movement to distinct targets. For<br>
example, it is presently believed that prior to the leukocyte extravasation, which is a mandatory<br>
component of the inflammatory response, activation of integrins constitutively expressed on<br>
leukocytes occurs and is followed by a tight ligand/receptor interaction between integrins (e.g.,<br>
LFA-1) and one or several distinct intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) designated ICAM-<br>
1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3 or ICAM-4 which are expressed on blood vessel endothelial cell surfaces<br>
and on other leukocytes. The interaction of the CAMs with the leukointegrins is a vital step in<br>
the normal functioning of the immune system. It is believed that immune processes such as<br>
antigen presentation, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and leukocyte extravasation all require cellular<br>
adhesion mediated by ICAMs interacting with the leukointegrins. See generally Kishimoto, T.<br>
K.; Rothlein; R. R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994, 25, 117-138 and Diamond, M.; Springer, T. Current<br>
Biology, 1994, 4, 506-532.<br>
Clearly, because of the role that the interaction of the CAMs and the leukointegrins plays<br>
in the immune response, it would be desirable to modulate these specific interactions to achieve a<br>
desired therapeutic result (e.g., inhibition of the interaction in the event of an overactive immune<br>
response). Significantly, it has been demonstrated that the antagonism of the interaction between<br>
the CAMs and the leukointegrins can be realized by agents directed against either component.<br>
Specifically, blocking of the CAMs, such as for example ICAM-1, or the leukointegrins, such as<br>
for example LFA-1, by antibodies directed against either or both of these molecules effectively<br>
inhibits inflammatory responses. In vitro models of inflammation and immune response<br>
inhibited by antibodies to CAMs or leukointegrins include antigen or mitogen-induced<br>
lymphocyte proliferation, homotypic aggregation of lymphocytes, T-cell mediated cytolysis and<br>
antigen-specific induced tolerance. The relevance of the in vitro studies are supported by in vivo<br>
studies with antibodies directed against ICAM-1 or LFA-1. For example, antibodies directed<br>
against LFA-1 can prevent thyroid graft rejection and prolong heart allograft survival in mice<br>
Gorski, A.; Immunology Today, 1994, 15, 251-255). Of greater significance, antibodies directed<br>
against ICAM-1 have shown efficacy in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents in human diseases such<br>
as renal allograft rejection and rheumatoid arthritis (Rothlein, R. R.; Scharschmidt, L., in:<br>
Adhesion Molecules; Wegner, C. D., Ed.; 1994, 1-38, Cosimi, C. B.; et al., J. Immunol. 1990,<br>
744, 4604-4612 and Kavanaugh, A.; et al. Arthritis Rheum. 1994, 37, 992-1004) and antibodies<br>
directed against LFA-1 have demonstrated immunosuppressive effects in bone marrow<br>
transplantation and in the prevention of early rejection of renal allografts (Fischer, A.; et al.<br>
Lancet, 1989, 2, 1058-1060 and Le Mauff, B.; et al, Transplantation, 1991, 52, 291-295).<br>
As described above, the use of anti-LFA-1 or anti-ICAM-1 antibodies to antagonize this<br>
interaction has been investigated. Additionally, the use of LFA-1 or ICAM-1 peptides,<br>
fragments or peptide antagonists {see, for example, US Patents 5,149,780, 5,288,854, 5,340,800,<br>
5,424,399, 5,470,953, Published PCT applications WO 90/03400, WO90/13316, WO90/10652,<br>
W091/19511, WO92/03473, WO94/11400, WO95/28170, JP4193895, EP314863, EP362526,<br>
EP362531), and small molecule antagonists have been investigated. For example, several small<br>
molecules have been described in the literature which affect the interaction of CAMs and<br>
leukointegrins. A natural product isolated from the root of Trichilia rubra was found to be<br>
inhibitory in an in vitro cell binding assay (Musza, L. L.; et al, Tetrahedron, 1994, 50, 11369-<br>
11378). One series of molecules (Boschelli, D. H.; et al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 111 and<br>
Boschelli, D. H.; et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 4597-4614) was found to be orally active in a<br>
reverse passive Arthus reaction, an induced model of inflammation that is characterized by<br>
neutrophil accumulation (Chang, Y. H.; et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992, 69, 155-164). Another<br>
series of molecules was also found to be orally active in a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction<br>
in rats (Sanfilippo, P. J.; et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1057-1059). All of these molecules<br>
appear to act nonspecifically, either by inhibiting the transcription of ICAM-1 along with other<br>
proteins or act intracellularly to inhibit the activation of the leukointegrins b; an unknown<br>
mechanism, and none appear to directly antagonize the interaction of the CAMs with the<br>
leukointegrins.<br>
Clearly, although several classes of compounds have been investigated for therapeutic use, there<br>
remains a need for the development of novel therapeutics that are capable of modulating<br>
interactions between CAMs and leukointegrins. In particular, it would be desirable to develop<br>
therapeutics capable of selectively targeting (preferably inhibiting) the interaction between LFA-<br>
and ICAM-1 that would be useful as a therapeutic agent for immune and/or inflammatory<br>
disorders.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
As discussed above, there remains a need for the development of novel therapeutics that are<br>
capable of modulating interactions between CAMs and leukointegrins. The present invention<br>
provides novel compounds of general formula (I),<br>
<br>
and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as described generally and in subclasses herein,<br>
which compounds are useful as modulators of the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion<br>
molecules. Thus these compounds are useful, for example, for the treatment of various LFA-1-<br>
related disorders including immune and/or inflammatory disorders.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating any disorder mediated<br>
through the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules comprising administering to a<br>
subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.<br>

loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers to esters that hydrolyze in<br>
vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound<br>
or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic,<br>
cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has<br>
not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates,<br>
propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.<br>

examples herein.<br>
Some of the foregoing compounds can comprise one or more asymmetric centers, and thus can<br>
exist in various isomeric forms, e.g., stereoisomers and/or diastereomers. Thus, inventive<br>
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be in the form of an individual<br>
enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric isomer, or may be in the form of a mixture of<br>
stereoisomers. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention are enantiopure<br>
compounds. In certain other embodiments, mixtures of stereoisomers or diastereomers are<br>
provided.<br>
Furthermore, certain compounds, as described herein may have one or more double bonds that<br>
can exist as either the Z or E isomer, unless otherwise indicated. The invention additionally<br>
encompasses the compounds as individual isomers substantially free of other isomers and<br>
alternatively, as mixtures of various isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of stereoisomers. In<br>
addition to the above-mentioned compounds per se, this invention also encompasses<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of these compounds and compositions comprising one<br>
or more compounds of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or<br>
additives.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared by crystallization of compound of formula (I) or<br>
(II) under different conditions and may exist as one or a combination of polymorphs of<br>
compound of general formula (I) or (II) forming part of this invention. For example, different<br>
polymorphs may be identified and/or prepared using different solvents, or different mixtures of<br>
solvents for recrystallization; by performing crystallizations at different temperatures; or by<br>
using various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during<br>
crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed<br>
by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR<br>
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractogram<br>
and/or other techniques. Thus, the present invention encompasses inventive compounds, their<br>
derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions containing them.<br>
2) Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that have biological properties<br>
useful for the treatment of Mac-1 and LFA-1 mediated disorders.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
provided, which comprise any one of the compounds described herein (or a prodrug,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof), and<br>
optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these<br>
compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of this invention may be administered to a patient in need thereof in<br>
combination with the administration of one or more other therapeutic agents. For example,<br>
additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or inclusion in a pharmaceutical<br>
composition with a compound of this invention may be an approved anti-inflammatory agent, or<br>
it may be any one of a number of agents undergoing approval in the Food and Drug<br>
Administration that ultimately obtain approval for the treatment of any disorder mediated by<br>
Mac-1 or LFA-1. It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention<br>
can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof.<br>
As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes any and all<br>
solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents,<br>
isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the<br>
like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,<br>
Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various<br>
carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the<br>
preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the<br>
compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise<br>
interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of<br>
materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to,<br>
sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch;<br>
cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and<br>
cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and<br>
suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive oil;<br>
corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl<br>
laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic<br>
acid; pyrogenfree water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer<br>
solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and<br>
magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening,<br>
flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the<br>
composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to<br>
the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the<br>
art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl<br>
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate,<br>
propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed,<br>
groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol,<br>
polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert<br>
diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying<br>
and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be<br>
formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and<br>
suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution,<br>
suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a<br>
solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed<br>
are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile,<br>
fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any<br>
bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty<br>
acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-<br>
retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions<br>
which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to<br>
use.<br>
In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug<br>
from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid<br>
suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of<br>
absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon<br>
crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally<br>
administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in<br>
biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to<br>
polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be<br>
controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include (poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in<br>
liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be<br>
prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or<br>
carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at<br>
ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal<br>
cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules.<br>
In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate<br>
and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic<br>
acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form<br>
may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled<br>
gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings<br>
well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying<br>
lgents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples<br>
of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid<br>
compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin<br>
capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight<br>
polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as<br>
noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be<br>
prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other<br>
coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active<br>
compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose and starch.<br>
Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other than<br>
inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such as magnesium stearate and<br>
microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also<br>
comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a<br>
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of<br>
the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions<br>
which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
The present invention encompasses pharmaceuticalLY acceptable topical formulations of<br>
inventive compounds. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulation", as used<br>
herein, means any formulation which is pharmaceutically acceptable for intradermal<br>
administration of a compound of the invention by application of the formulation to the<br>
epidermis. In certain embodiments of the invention, the topical formulation comprises a carrier<br>
system. Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are not limited to, solvents (e.g.,<br>
alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters, liposomes, powders,<br>
emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g., hypotonic or buffered saline) or any<br>
other carrier known in the art for topically administering pharmaceuticals. A more complete<br>
listing of art-known carriers is provided by reference texts that are standard in the art, for<br>
example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, 1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both<br>
published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entireties. In certain other embodiments, the topical formulations of<br>
the invention may comprise excipients. Any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient known in the<br>
art may be used to prepare the inventive pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations.<br>
Examples of excipients that can be included in the topical formulations of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents,<br>
solubilizing agents, other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and propellants, and/or<br>
additional therapeutic agents used in combination to the inventive compound. Suitable<br>
preservatives include, but are not limited to, alcohols, quaternary amines, organic acids,<br>
parabens, and phenols. Suitable antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and its<br>
esters, sodium bisulfite, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols, and<br>
chelating agents like EDTA and citric acid. Suitable moisturizers include, but are not limited to,<br>
glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol. Suitable buffering agents<br>
for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, citric, hydrochloric, and lactic acid<br>
buffers. Suitable solubilizing agents include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium<br>
chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysorbates. Suitable skin protectants<br>
that can be used in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations of the invention<br>
comprise at least a compound of the invention and a penetration enhancing agent. The choice of<br>
topical formulation will depend or several factors, including the condition to be treated, the<br>
physicochemical characteristics of the inventive compound and other excipients present, their<br>
stability in the formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and costs constraints. As used<br>
herein the term " penetration enhancing agent " means an agent capable of transporting a<br>
pharmacologically active compound through the stratum corneum and into the epidermis or<br>
dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been<br>
evaluated as to their effectiveness in enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin.<br>
See, for example, Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.),<br>
CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin<br>
penetration enhancers, and Buyuktimkin et al, Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug<br>
Permeation Enhancement in Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Gosh T. K.,<br>
Pfister W. R., Yum S. I. (Eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, 111. (1997). In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, penetration agents for use with the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, triglycerides (e.g., soybean oil), aloe compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400,<br>
propylene glycol, N-decylmethylsulfoxide, fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl<br>
laurate, glycerol monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate) and N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of ointments, pastes, creams,<br>
lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
formulations of the compositions according to the invention are creams, which may further<br>
contain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid,<br>
palmito-oleic acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, stearic acid being particularly preferred. Creams of the<br>
invention may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-stearate. In certain<br>
embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic<br>
formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this<br>
invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches,<br>
which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body.<br>
Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium.<br>
As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also be used to increase the flux of the<br>
compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling<br>
membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to,<br>
or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular<br>
combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will<br>
take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired<br>
therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may<br>
achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be<br>
administered concurrently with another anti-inflammatory agent), or they may achieve different<br>
effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention further<br>
comprise one or more additional therapeutically active ingredients (e.g., anti-inflammatory<br>
and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention, the term "Palliative " refers to treatment that is<br>
focused on the relief of symptoms of a disease and/or side effects of a therapeutic regimen, but is<br>
not curative. For example, palliative treatment encompasses painkillers, antinausea medications<br>
and anti-sickness drugs.<br>
3) Research Uses, Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
Research Uses<br>
According to the present invention, the inventive compounds may be assayed in any of the<br>
available assays known in the art for identifying compounds having the ability to modulate<br>
adhesion between intracellular adhesion molecules and the leukocyte integrin family of<br>
receptors; to antagonize CD11/CD18 receptors associated with leukocytes and/or to antagonize<br>
Mac-1 and/or LFA-1. For example, the assay may be cellular or non-cellular, in vivo or in vitro,<br>
high- or low-throughput format, etc.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, compounds of this invention which are of particular interest include those<br>
which:<br>
modulate adhesion between intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, -2 and -3) and the<br>
leukocyte integrin family of receptors;<br>
exhibit the ability to antagonize CD11/CD18 receptors associated with leukocytes;<br>
exhibit the ability to antagonize Mac-1 and/or LFA-1; and<br>
are useful for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders.<br>

Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
As discussed above, certain of the compounds as described herein exhibit activity generally as<br>
modulators of adhesion between intracellular adhesion molecules. More specifically,<br>
compounds of the invention demonstrate the ability to antagonize CD11/CD18 receptors<br>
associated with leukocytes and in certain embodiments exhibit the ability to antagonize LFA-1<br>
interactions. Thus, in certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful for the<br>
treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, methods for treating (or preventing) of LFA-1<br>
mediated disorders are provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
a compound of formula (I) or (II) as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments, a method for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders is provided comprising<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts<br>
and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result.<br>
In certain embodiments, the method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof to a subject<br>
(including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it.<br>
As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that have biological properties<br>
useful for the treatment of Mac-1 and/or LFA-1 mediated disorders. In certain embodiments, the<br>
inventive compounds as useful for the treatment of psoriasis, responses a-sociated with<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), dermatitis,<br>
meningitis, encephalitis, uveitis, allergic conditions such as eczema and asthma, conditions<br>
involving infiltration of T-cells and chronic inflammatory responses, skin hypersensitivity<br>
reactions (including poison ivy and poison oak), artherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases such as<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis,<br>
Reynaud's syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,<br>
Sjorgen's syndrome, juvenile onset diabetes and immune responses associated with delayed<br>
hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis,<br>
sarcoidosis, polymyositis, granulomatosis and vasculitis, pernicious anemia, diseases involving<br>
leukocyte diapedeses, CNS inflammatory disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to<br>
septicaemia or trauma, autoimune hemolytic anemia, myasthemia gravis, antigen-antibody<br>
complex mediated diseases, all types of transplantations, including graft versus host or host<br>
/ersus graft disease, HIV and rhinovirus infection, and pulmonary fibrosis to nairn- a few.<br>
As described in more detail herein, in general, compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
antagonists of the interaction between intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, 2 or 3)<br>
and the leukocyte integrin family of receptors. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present<br>
invention provides compounds useful for the treatment of disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18<br>
family of cellular adhesion molecules. In certain embodiments of special interest, the present<br>
invention provides compounds useful for the treatment of disorders mediated by Mac-1 and/or<br>
LFA-1. For example, compounds of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment<br>
inflammatory disorders, organ graft rejection and autoimmune disorders, to name a few.<br>
Thus, as described above, in another aspect of the invention, a method for the treatment of<br>
disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules is provided<br>
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II)<br>
as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments of special interest the<br>
inventive method is used for the treatment of disorders mediated by Mac-1 or LFA-1. It will be<br>
appreciated that the compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present<br>
invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for<br>
the treatment of disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules.<br>
For example, in certain exemplary embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
antagonists of the interaction between Mac-1 or LFA-1 and intracellular adhesion molecules<br>
(e.g., ICAM-1) and thus the compounds are useful for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders<br>
including, but not limited to, psoriasis, responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease<br>
(such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), dermatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, uveitis,<br>
allergic conditions such as eczema and asthma, conditions involving infiltration of T-cells and<br>
chronic inflammatory responses, skin hypersensitivity reactions (including poison ivy and poison<br>
oak), atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus (SLE), diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Reynaud's syndrome, autoimmune<br>
thyroiditis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Sjorgen's syndrome, juvenile onset<br>
diabetes, and immune responses associated with delayed hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines<br>
and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, granulomatosis<br>
and vasculitis, pernicious anemia, diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis, CNS inflammatory<br>
disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicaemia or trauma, autoimmune<br>
hemolytic anemia, myasthemia gravis, antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases, all types of<br>
transplantations, including graft versus host or host versus graft disease, HIV and rhinovirus<br>
infection, pulmonary fibrosis and the like, to name a few. Thus, the expression "effective<br>
amount" as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to antagonize the interaction<br>
between intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM) and the leukocyte integrin family of<br>
receptors, and to exhibit a therapeutic effect. The exact amount required will vary from subject<br>
to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the<br>
infection, the particular therapeutic agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The<br>
compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of<br>
administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein<br>
refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It<br>
will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the<br>
present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical<br>
judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the<br>
disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed;<br>
the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route<br>
of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the<br>
treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and<br>
like factors well known in the medical arts (see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, "The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Tenth Edition, A. Gilman, J.Hardman and L. Limbird,<br>
eds., McGraw-Hill Press, 155-173, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety).<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inhibiting the interaction between LFA-1<br>
and ICAM-1 in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises administering to the<br>
patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I or II or a<br>

General Reaction Procedures:<br>
Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were stirred using a magnetically driven stirrer<br>
bar. An inert atmosphere refers to either dry argon or dry nitrogen. Reactions were monitored<br>
either by thin layer chromatography, by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by high-<br>
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), of a suitably worked up sample of the reaction mixture.<br>
General Work Up Procedures:<br>
Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature or below then<br>
juenched, when necessary, with either water or a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium<br>
chloride. Desired products were extracted by partitioning between water and a suitable water-<br>
immiscible solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether). The desired product<br>
containing extracts were washed appropriately with water followed by a saturated solution of<br>
brine. On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual<br>
oxidants, the extract was washed with a 10% solution of sodium sulphite in saturated aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure. On occasions<br>
where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual acids, the extract was<br>
washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned<br>
washing procedure (except in those cases where the desired product itself had acidic character).<br>
On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual bases, the<br>
extract was washed with 10% aqueous citric acid solution, prior to the aforementioned washing<br>
procedure (except in those cases where the desired product itself had basic character). Post<br>
washing, the desired product containing extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate,<br>
and then filtered. The crude products were then isolated by removal of solvent(s) by rotary<br>
evaporation under reduced pressure, at an appropriate temperature (generally less than 45°C).<br>
General Purification Procedures:<br>
Unless mentioned specifically, chromatographic purification refers to flash column<br>
chromatography on silica, using a single solvent or mixed solvent as eluent. Suitably purified<br>
desired product containing elutes were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure at an<br>
" appropriate temperature (generally less than 45°C) to constant mass. Final compounds were<br>
dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile, filtered and transferred to vials, then freeze-dried under<br>
high vacuum before submission for biological testing.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example describes the synthesis of<br>
<br>
which was prepared according to Scheme 1A and the procedure below.<br>
a) A solution of 3-methoxyphenylethylamine (0.2 mol) and formaldehyde (0.22 mol) in aqueous<br>
HCl (20%, 500 mL) was heated at 80 °C for 4 hours. The reaction was then concentrated to<br>
dryness, and the residue was dissolved in hydrobromic acid (40% aqueous, 500 mL), and<br>
rcfluxed for 24 hours. The reaction was concentrated to give a brownish solid, which was used<br>
without purification. To the residue was added water (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran ("THF")<br>
(300 mL), and to the resulting mixture was very carefully added with sodium carbonate (solid,<br>
0.5 mol), followed by di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.3 mol). After 15 hours at room temperature,<br>
the reaction was extracted with ethyl acetate (1 L), and the organic extract was washed with<br>
saturated potassium dihydrophosphate and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and<br>
filtered.<br>
The residue after concentration of the filtrate was dissolved in dichloromethane ("DCM"; 100<br>
mL), and to it was slowly added acetic acid (500 mL) and surfuryl chloride (0.6 mol). After the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction was concentrated to<br>
dryness, and further dried under high vacuum for 2 hours. The crude product was used without<br>
further purification for next step. The crude product was dissolved in water/THF (200 mL/400<br>
mL), and to it was added carefully and slowly sodium carbonate (0.5 mol) with good stirring,<br>
followed by di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.3 mol). After the reaction mixture was stirred for 12<br>
hours, the reaction was carefully neutralized with phosphoric acid (2 M) to pH about 7. The<br>
resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL x2), and the combined extracts were<br>
washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.<br>
The crude solid was recrystalized from ethyl acetate and hexane (about 1:2 ratio) to yield a white<br>
solid. The mother liquid was concentrated and purified by column, eluting with 0-10% ethyl<br>
acetate in 4:1 hexane:methylene chloride. The combined yield is 14.5 g (23% from commercial<br>
3-methoxyphenethylamine). MS (API-ES+) m/z: 262, 264, 266 (M+H-tert-butyl+).<br>
The product obtained above was dissolved in DCM (100 mL) and pyridine (50 mL). The<br>
resulting solution was cooled to —40 °C, and to it was added triflic anhydride (51 mmol) slowly.<br>
After the reaction mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature over 4 hours, the reaction<br>
.mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate (500 mL) and water (100 mL), and the organic<br>
layer was washed with water (100 mL, twice) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by columm, eluting with<br>
0-5% ethyl acetate in 5:1 hexane:DCM to give the corresponding triflate (9.73 g, 48% yield).<br>
A mixture of 10mmol of the triflate, l.Ommol of 1,3-diphenylphosinepropane ("dppp") and<br>
40mmol of di-isopropylethylamine ("DIEA") in 100mL of dry dimethylformamide ("DMF") and<br>
50mL of anhydrous CH3OH was flushed with CO for 15 min, and then 1.0mmol of Pd(OAc)2<br>
was added under the atmosphere of CO. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was stirred at 70 °C<br>
overnight under an atmosphere of CO. The solvent was removed and the residue was purified by<br>
column chromatography using EtOAc/hexane = 1/4 (v/v) as the eluent to give compound 1.1 with<br>
a 56% yield. ESI-MS (m/z): (M+)+Na 382.1; 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400MHz): d 7.32 (s, 1H), 4.60<br>

b) A mixture of 1.1 (5 mmol) and 30mmol of LiI in 20mL of pyridine was reflux overnight.<br>
The solvent was removed and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc. The resulting solution was<br>
then washed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was<br>
removed and the residue was dried in vacuo to give a quantitative yield of compound 1.3. The<br>
crude product was carried on the next step without further purification. ESI-MS (m/z): (M - tBu<br>
+1), 290.<br>
c) A solution of Boc-Dap-OH (10 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was treated with<br>
trimethylsilyldiazomethane until the color remained light yellow for 10 seconds. The mixture<br>
was concentrated, and the residue was dissolved in DCM (30 mL). To the solution was added<br>
triethylamine (20 mmol) and followed by 3-thienylcarboxyl chloride (11 mmol). After 0.5 hour<br>
at room temperature, the reaction was filtered through silica gel, and concentrated. The residue<br>
was purified by column with 10-50% ethyl acetate in hexane. The product obtained this way<br>
was dissolved in DCM (10 mL) and treated with HC1 (4 M in dioxane, 10 mL). After 5 hours,<br>
the reaction was concentrated to give the title compound (60-80% overall yield).<br>

temperature for 6 hours. The solvent was then removed and the residue was diluted with<br>
saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc for 3 times. The extracts<br>
were then dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed and the residue was dried in<br>
vacuo to give compound 1.5 which was used without further purification. ESI-MS (m/z): (M+1)<br>

Diversification:<br>
It will also be appreciated that each of the components used in the synthesis of inventive<br>
compounds can be diversified either before synthesis or alternatively after the construction of the<br>
core structure of formula (I). As used herein, the term "diversifying" or "diversify" means<br>
reacting an inventive compound (I) or any of the precursor fragments (or any classes or<br>
subclasses thereof) at one or more reactive sites to modify a functional moiety or to add a<br>
functional moiety (e.g., nucleophilic addition of a substrate). Described generally herein are a<br>
variety of schemes to assist the reader in the synthesis of a variety of compounds, either by<br>
diversification of the intermediate components or by diversification of the core structures as<br>
described herein, and classes and subclasses thereof. It will be appreciated that a variety of<br>
diversification reactions can be employed to generate compounds other than those described in<br>
the Exemplification herein. As but a few examples, where a double bond is present in the<br>
compound structure, epoxidation and aziridation can be conducted to generate epoxide and<br>
aziridine derivatives of compounds described herein. For additional guidance available in the<br>
art, the practitioner is directed to "Advanced Organic Chemistry", March, J. John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>

As discussed above, LFA-ICAM interactions have been directly implicated in numerous<br>
inflammatory disease states including, but not limited to graft rejection, dermatitis, psoriasis,<br>
asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, compounds capable of modulating adhesion between<br>
intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, -2 and -3) and the leukocyte integrin family of<br>
receptors would be useful in the development of novel therapeutics. Described below are certain<br>
assays used for the determination of ICAM-1 :LFA Receptor binding, Human T-Cell Adhesion,<br>
and T-Cell proliferation which are described in published PCT applications WO 99/49856 and<br>

T-Cell Proliferation Assay:<br>
This assay is an in vitro model of lymphocyte proliferation resulting from activation, induced by<br>
engagement of the T-cell receptor and LFA-1, upon interaction with antigen presenting cells<br>
(Springer, Nature 346: 425 (1990)).<br>
Microtiter plates (Nunc 96 well ELISA certified) are pre-coated overnight at 4°C with 50 µl of 2<br>
µg/ml of goat anti-human Fc(Caltag H10700) and 50 µl of 0.07 µg/ml monoclonal antibody to<br>
CD3 (Immunotech 0178) in sterile PBS. The next day coat solutions are aspirated. Plates are<br>
then washed twice with PBS and 100 u.1 of 17 ng/ml 5d-ICAM-1-IgG is added for 4 hours at<br>
37°C. Plates are washed twice with PBS prior to addition of CD4+ T cells. Lymphocytes from<br>
peripheral blood are separated from heparinized whole blood drawn from healthy donors. An<br>
alternative method is to obtain whole blood from healthy donors through leukophoresis. Blood<br>
is diluted 1:1 with saline, layered and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 30 minutes on LSM (6.2 g<br>
Ficoll and 9.4 g sodium diztrizoate per 100 ml) (Organon Technica, NJ). Monocytes are<br>
depleted using a myeloid cell depletion reagent method (Myeloclear, Cedarlane Labs, Hornby,<br>
Ontario, Canada). PBLs are resuspended in 90% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine serum and 10%<br>
DMSO, aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, cells are resuspended in RPMI<br>
1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine<br>
serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), ImM sodium pyruvate, 3 mM L-glutamine, ImM nonessential<br>
amino acids, 500 µg/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml gentamycin (Gibco).<br>
Purification of CD4+ T cells are obtained by negative selection method (Human CD4 Cell<br>
Recovery Column Kit # CL110-5 Accurate). 100,000 purified CD4+ T cells (90% purity) per<br>
microtiter plate well are cultured for 72 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 in 100 ml of culture medium<br>
(RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Intergen), 0.1mM non-<br>
essential amino acids, 1 nM Sodium Pyruvate, 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 µg/ml Streptomycin.<br>
50 µg /ml Gentamicin, 10 mM Hepes and 2 mM Glutamine). Inhibitors are added to the plate at<br>
the initiation of culture. Proliferative responses in these cultures are measured by addition of 1<br>
µCi/well titrated thymidine during the last 6 hours before harvesting of cells. Incorporation of<br>
radioactive label is measured by liquid scintillation counting (Packard 96 well harvester and<br>
counter). Results are expressed in counts per minute (cpm).<br>
In vitro Mixed Lymphocyte Culture Model:<br>
The mixed lymphocyte culture model, which is an in vitro model of transplantation (A.J.<br>
Cunningham, "Understanding Immunology, Transplantation Immunology" pages 157-159<br>
(1978) examines the effects of various LFA-1 antagonists in both the proliferative and effector<br>
arms of the human mixed lymphocyte response.<br>
Isolation of Cells: Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMC) are separated from<br>
heparanized whole blood drawn from healthy donors. Blood is diluted 1:1 with saline, layered,<br>
and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 30 minutes on LSM (6.2 g Ficoll and 9.4 g sodium diztrizoate per<br>
100 ml) (Organon Technica, NJ). An alternative method is to obtain whole blood from healthy<br>
donors through leukophoresis. PBMCs are separated as above, resuspended in 90% heat<br>
inactivated Fetal Bovine serum and 10% DMSO, aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. After<br>
thawing, cells are resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented<br>
with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 1 mM sodium pyruvate,<br>
3 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 500 µg/ml penicillin, 50 µg /ml<br>
streptomycin, 50 µg/ml gentamycin (Gibco).<br>
Mixed Lymphocyte Response (MLR): One way human mixed lymphocyte cultures are<br>
established are in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. 1.5 x 105 responder PBMCs are co-<br>
cultured with an equal number of allogeneic irradiated (3000 rads for 3 minutes, 52 seconds<br>
stimulator PBMSc in 200 µl of complete medium. LFA-1 antagonists are added at the initiation<br>
of cultures. Cultures are incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 6 days, then pulsed with 1 u.Ci/well of<br>
3H-thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol, NEN, Boston, MA) for 6 hours. Cultures are harvested on a<br>
Packard cell harvester (Packard, Canberra, Canada). [3H] TdR incorporation is measured by<br>
liquid scintillation counting. Results are expressed as counts per minute (cpm).<br>
