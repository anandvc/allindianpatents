In particular this invention, relates to the loaded vehicles, road wheel rotating with out friction by the provision of vehicles lower body road wheels rotatable shaft with its pinions and upper bodys fixed shaft with its ratchet gear meshing in 75° above to 90° below, for anti clock wise rotation of the road wheels, the ratchet outer gear rotate clock wise at that time anti clock wise rotation of the another ratchet gear rotate as idle gear by the lever operation and for clock wise rotation of the road wheels, another ratchet gear meshing with its pinion is in 90° above to 135° below the ratchet outer gear rotates anti clocks wise at that time clock wise Rotation of the other ratchet gear rotate as idle gear by the lever operation lower body and the upper body connected with pin and bush with springs.<br>
In the prior made vehicles road wheels rotating with rolling friction due to weight and the rotating capacity of the road wheels relates to the in put power, further it has been found that considerable amount of fuel energy is wasted in the previously made vehicles.<br>
In the proposed invention, vehicles lower body road wheels rotatable shaft with its pinions is separated, from the upper body with its fixed shafts and its ratchet gear meshing like neutral equilibrium arrangement and the upper body and the lower body connected with pin and bush in horizontal plane to have sliding motion and resulting inclined plane mechanical advantage for road wheels rotation with out friction.<br>
This invention, will now be described in further details with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 Shows the general arrangement of the parallel road wheels of the vehicles.<br>
Figure 2 Shows for two wheels, front and back or rear wheels rotation with out friction.<br>
Figure 3 ratchet gear side view.<br>
Vehicles lower body consisting of two side frames and two cross frames (1) at the centre of the two side frames, one rotatable shaft (2) is mounted this rotatable shaft is having two pinions (3) and (4) rigidly mounted on the said shaft (2).<br>
Two road wheels (5) fixed both ends of the rotatable shaft (2) vehicles upper body consisting of two side frames and four cross frames (6) two fixed axles (7) and (8) each end are fixed in the two side frames (6) shown in the figure (1). Two free wheel gears (9) and (10) inner disc mounted on the fixed axles (7) and (8) are having known type free wheeling arrangements as in cycle rickshaw. Vehicles upper body (6) middle cross frames centre two pins (11) are connected to the lower body (1) cross frame centre two bushes (12). Two springs (13) are connected to the upper body (6) and the lower body (1) shown in the figure 1.<br>
The fixed shaft (7) with its free wheel outer gear teeth (9) is in mesh with the pinion (3) making an angle 75° above and 90° below and the fixed shaft (8) with its free wheel outer gear, teeth (10) is in mesh with the pinion teeth (4) making an angle 90° above to 135° below with its horizontal plane,<br>
 <br>
The two road wheels (5) is rotated anti clock wise direction, the rotatable shaft (2) with its pinion (3) also rotate anti clock wise in turn the free wheel outer gear (9) is rotated clock wise like neutral equilibrium arrangement and at that time free wheel outer gear (10) is in neutral position and it rotates as idling gear by the arrangements of clutch operation, the lever (3) closed in the curve of the inner disc (2) road wheels (5) is rotated clock wise the rotatable shaft (2) with its pinion (4) also rotate clock wise in turn, the free wheel outer gear (10) is rotated anti clock wise like neutral equilibr ium arrangement, at that time free wheel outer gear (9) is neutral and its rotation is as idling gear by the arrangement of clutch operation the lever closed in the curve of the inner disc (2) as shown in the figure (3), as known type of the clutch cable wire with its lever operation as on the motor cycle handle not shown in the figure.<br>
Figure 2<br>
Another modification of this device where in front and rear road wheels for two wheelers rotating with out friction.<br>
1A Ratchet gear fixed in the end of the front fork(10) as shown in the figure 2. 2A Gear fixed with the front road wheel (4).<br>
3 An accuate rod, one end fixed with bolt and nut in the middle of the front fork (10) to act up and down oscillating way, another end fixed in the front road wheel (4) shaft.<br>
4F ront road wheel with its gear (2) fixed another end of the accuate rod (3) as in the cycle.<br>
5	Horizontal fork to act up and down oscillating way like known type of motor cycles.<br>
6	Gear fixed with rear road wheel (7)<br>
7	The road wheel (7) fixed in the end of the horizontal fork (5) as in the cycle<br>
8	Back vertical fork one end fixed under the seat, and another end ratchet gear (9) is fixed.<br>
9Ratchet gear is fixed one end of the vertical fork (8).<br>
10 Front fork one end the ratchet gear (1) is fixed.<br>
lla spring one end connected in the middle of the front fork (10) another end connected in the middle of the accuate road(3).<br>
11A another spring one end connected in the middle of the vertical fork (8) other end connected in the middle of the horizontal fork (5) front fork (10) end ratchet gear (1) meshing on the front road wheel gear (2) and the back vertical fork (8) end ratchet gear (9) meshes in the road wheel (7), gear (6) meshing in 75° above to 90° below for its neutral equilibrium arrangement the road wheels anti clock wise rotation the ratchet gear (1) and (9) rotate clock wise with same gearing system assembled at the opposite side not shown in the figure. The free wheel with chain and sprocket rotation for peddelling is not shown in the figure wheel spokes are not shown in the figure.<br>
 <br>
Figure 3<br>
Ratchet gear or free wheel gear system<br>
1 known type cycle free wheel outer ring or upper ring, made of spur gear shape.<br>
Inner disc 2 ratchet lever 3 with its spring as it is in cycle free wheel known type.<br>
2A Outer ring made of spur gear shape when in neutral possition the spur gear rotate<br>
freely as idling gear.<br>
Liver 3 pin 4 enter in to cross hole 5 to the out side of the inner disc 2<br>
Liver 3 pin 4 enter in to the cross hole 5 to the other side of the inner disc 2 handle 6 one end is fixed with the out side end of the pin 4 and other end connected with one end of a cable wire other end cable wire connected with a lever. The lever fixed on the handle as known type clutch operation in the motor cycle not shown in the figure from this lever operation lever 3 with its spring lie on the inner disc 2 curve, at that time free wheel outer spur gear rotate as idling gear.<br>
5A cross hole in the inner disc 2.<br>
6	One end of the handle 6 connected with the pin end 4, another end connected with one end of the clutch wire, another end of the clutch wire connected to the handle lever is fixed on the handle for the convenience of the operater choise as known type clutch wire with its lever operation the lever is fixed as on the motor cycle handle not shown in the figure.<br>
7	A centre hole to fix the inner disc 2 on the fixed shaft as known type free wheeling arrangements as in the cycle rickshaw.<br>
I claim: -<br>
Vehicles road wheels rotating with out friction means the vehicle lower body road wheels rotatable shaft with its two pinion and the upper body two fixed shaftes with its ratchet fears, one Ratchet with its pinion meshing in 45° above to 90° below, another Ratchet gear with its pinion mesh in 90° above to 135° below and the upper body and the lower body connected with pin and bush &amp; two springs.<br>
