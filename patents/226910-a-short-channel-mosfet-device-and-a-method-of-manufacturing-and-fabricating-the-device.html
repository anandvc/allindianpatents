				<td>Title: MOSFET DEVICE SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to field of metal oxide semiconductor field<br>
effect transistors (MOSFETs), and has specific application to the fabrication of these<br>
devices in the context of an integrated circuit (IC).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the invention of the transistor in the late 1940s, tremendous advances have<br>
been made in the field of microelectronics. Current technology allows for the cost-<br>
effective fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs) with over 100 million components - all on<br>
a piece of silicon roughly 10mm on a side. The one billion transistor IC will be<br>
commercially available within a few years. The desire for greater functionality and<br>
performance at less cost per IC drives several trends.<br>
First, functionality drives IC transistor counts up. Second, the transistors<br>
themselves are being reduced in size so as to achieve greater packing density and, very<br>
importantly, to improve their performance. As far as performance is concerned, the key<br>
parameter for Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Field-Effect-Transistors (MOSFETs, the<br>
dominant transistor technology of the day) is the channel length. The channel length (L)<br>
is the distance that charge carriers must travel to pass through the device, and a reduction<br>
in this length simultaneously implies higher current drives, reduced parasitic resistances<br>
and capacitances and improved high-frequency performance. A common figure-of-merit<br>
is the power-delay product, and this generalized measure of transistor performance<br>
improves as the cube of the inverse of the channel length (1/L3). This explains the<br>
tremendous incentive that IC manufacturers have to reduce the channel length as much as<br>
manufacturing capabilities will allow.<br><br>
For digital applications, MOS transistors behave like switches. When 'on', they<br>
drive relatively large amounts of current, and when turned 'off they are characterized by<br>
a certain amount of leakage current. As channel lengths are reduced, drive currents<br>
increase, which is beneficial for circuit performance as stated above. However, leakage<br>
currents increase as well. Leaky transistors contribute to quiescent power dissipation (the<br>
power dissipated by an IC when idle) and in extreme cases can affect the transfer of<br>
binary information during active operation. Device designers therefore have good reason<br>
to keep leakage currents low as channel lengths are reduced.<br>
MOS transistor leakage currents are traditionally controlled by introducing<br>
controlled amounts of impurities (dopants) into the channel region of the device, and by<br>
tailoring the source/drain lateral and vertical doping distributions. Although these<br>
approaches are effective in shoring up the potential barrier internal to the MOS transistor<br>
and therefore reducing the leakage current, they can also contribute to degraded drive<br>
current and increased parasitic capacitance - the very items that channel length reduction<br>
is meant to improve. Furthermore, depending on exactly how in the manufacturing<br>
process the channel and tailored source/drain dopants are introduced, the manufacturing<br>
cost can be affected significantly. Given traditional MOS transistor design and<br>
architecture, there are only limited solutions to the trade-off between drive current,<br>
leakage current, parasitic capacitance and resistance, and manufacturing complexity/cost.<br>
The present invention offers a new relationship between these competing<br>
requirements, and makes possible MOS devices with characteristics that are not achievable<br>
with traditional (impurity doped) MOS architectures. The use of metal for the source and<br>
drain and a simple, uniformly implanted channel dopant profile provides for improvements<br>
to device characteristics in terms of reduced parasitic capacitance, reduced statistical<br><br>
variations in these characteristics (especially as the channel length is decreased) and<br>
reduced manufacturing cost and complexity.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Doping Profiles<br>
Previous generations of MOS transistors have relied on laterally uniform, and<br>
vertically non-uniform channel doping profiles to control drain-to-source leakage currents.<br>
See Yuan Taur, "The Incredible Shrinking Transistor", IEEE SPECTRUM, pages 25-<br>
29 (www.spectrum.ieee.org. ISSN 0018-9235. July 1999). FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary<br>
long-channel conventional MOS device (100) that comprises an impurity doped source<br>
(101), an impurity doped drain (102), a conventional MOS type gate stack (103), and a<br>
laterally uniform channel doping profile (104) in the substrate to assist in the control of<br>
source-to-drain leakage currents. Devices are electrically isolated from each other via a<br>
field oxide (105). Such channel dopant profiles are common in devices with channel<br>
lengths down to approximately 200 nanometers (nm).<br>
However, as device channel lengths have been reduced ito the 100 nm regime the<br>
literature teaches that channel doping profiles that are non-uniform in both the<br>
lateral and vertical directions are required. Referencing FIG. 2, the exemplary short-<br>
channel MOS device (200) has some elements similar to the long-channel MOS device<br>
(100). The structure comprises a conventional impurity doped source (201) and drain<br>
(202) as well as a conventional MOS gate stack (203) (width 
the channel length L). The structure further comprises shallow, impurity doped extensions<br>
for the source (208) and drain (209) electrodes which are used in conjunction with drain<br>
(206) and source (207) pocket doping as well as conventional channel doping (204) to<br>
control source to drain leakage currents. Source and drain electrodes (201) and (202) and<br><br>
their respective extensions (208) and (209) (the combination of all four of which comprise<br>
the tailored source/drain doping profile) are all of the same doping polarity (either N-type<br>
or P-type) and are of the opposite polarity from the channel (204) and pocket doping<br>
elements (206) and (207). Again, a field oxide (205) electrically isolates devices from<br>
each other.<br>
In his paper entitled "25 nm CMOS Design Considerations" (1998 IEDM<br>
Technical Digest, page 789), Yuan Taur states<br>
"... an optimized, vertically and laterally non-uniform<br>
doping profile, called the super-halo, is needed to control the<br>
short channel effect"<br>
A similar statement has been made in the IEEE Spectrum magazine:<br>
"... in the 100 to 130 nm lithography generation, an<br>
optimally tailored profile that is both vertically and laterally<br>
non-uniform (Super-Halo) is need to control [short channel<br>
effects]."<br>
See Linda Geppert, "The 100-Million Transistor IC", IEEE SPECTRUM, pages 23-24<br>
(www.spectrum.ieee.org. ISSN 0018-9235, July 1999).<br>
Furthermore, virtually all the prior art that discusses device design for channel<br>
lengths less than 200 nm states or implies that channel doping profiles that are highly non-<br>
uniform in both the lateral and vertical directions are required for adequate control of<br>
drain-to-source leakage currents. For example, Hargrove in his paper "High-Performance<br>
sub 0.08um CMOS with Dual Gate Oxide and 9.7 ps Inverter Delay (1998 IEDM,<br>
page 627) states<br><br>
"In order to achieve optimal device performance ... strong<br>
halos coupled with shallow junctions are required."<br>
The prior art is virtually unanimous in its statement that laterally and vertically non-<br>
uniform doping profiles, in the form of laterally non-uniform channel dopants and<br>
shallow source/drain extensions, are required for adequate control of short channel<br>
effects.<br>
Pocket/Halo Implants<br>
Laterally non-uniform channel doping profiles are almost exclusively introduced<br>
after the gate electrode has been defined and is in place. With the gate serving as an<br>
implant mask, dopants of the same type as those already in the substrate are introduced<br>
into the channel regions adjacent to the gate electrode's edges via ion-implantation. As<br>
mentioned previously, these are often referred to as "pocket" or "halo" implants. See<br>
Yuan Taur, 'The Incredible Shrinking Transistor". IEEE SPECTRUM, page 28<br>
(www.spectrum.ieee.org. ISSN 0018-9235. July 1999).<br>
While effective at reinforcing the electrostatic potential barrier between the source<br>
and drain (and therefore reducing leakage currents). Halo/Pocket implants along with<br>
shallow source/drain extensions (the tailored source/drain doping profiles mentioned<br>
previously) add complexity to the manufacturing process. At least two additional<br>
lithography steps, as well as the associated cleans, implants, metrology, etc. are required to<br>
implement these process steps. As lithography is one of the most (if not the most)<br>
expensive process modules in the production process, this is a significant increase in<br>
manufacturing cost Halo and Pocket implants as well as shallow source/drain<br>
extensions can also add parasitic capacitance and a random statistical variation to device<br>
electrical characteristics.<br><br>
Channel doping profiles for short channel Schottky MOS devices have received<br>
only very limited attention in the prior art. J. R. Tucker discusses simulations done on<br>
very short channel SBMOS devices and only mentions in passing that<br>
"... some doping of the semiconductor channel region will<br>
be required in order to suppress (leakage) currents<br>
See J. R. Tucker, C. Wang, J.W. Lyding, T. C. Shen, G. C. Abeln, "Nanometer Scale<br>
MOSFETs and STM Patterning on Si," SSDM 1994, pages 322-324; J. R. Tucker, C.<br>
Wang, P.S. Carney, "Silicon Field-Effect Transistor Based on Quantum Tunneling,"<br>
Applied Physics Letters. 1 Aug. 1994, Vol. 65, No. 5, pages 618-620. It is significant to<br>
note that Tucker does not discuss in what manner one might go about introducing channel<br>
doping to suppress source-to-drain leakage currents.<br>
Q.T. Zhao is the next author to explicitly address the issue of channel doping to<br>
control leakage currents. His approach (uniform doping of the substrate to quite high<br>
levels (10l7/cm3)) is well known to be non-optimal for short channel devices. Although he<br>
is successful in reducing leakage currents, he does so at the expense of increased<br>
source/drain-to-substrate capacitance. See Q.T. Zhao, F. Klinkhammer, M. Dolle, L.<br>

channel Schottky barrier metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors,"<br>

W. Saitoh reports on a device built on SOI substrates but does not discuss substrate<br>
doping in this context. See W. Saitoh, S. Yamagami, A. Itoh, M. Asada, "35 nm metal<br>
gate SOI-P-MOSFETs with PtSi Schottky source/drain," Device Research Conference,<br>
June 28-30, 1999, Santa Barbara, CA, Paper DLA.6, page 30.<br><br>
C. Wang mentions the use of "a layer of fully-depleted dopants beneath the active<br>
region" and "preimplanting a thin subsurface layer of fully depleted dopants" to control<br>
leakage currents, but does not describe the lateral uniformity or lack thereof of the doping<br>
profile, or how one might go about producing the "layer". See C. Wang, John P. Snyder, J.<br>
R. Tucker, "Sub-40 nm PtSi Schottky source/drain metal-oxide-semiconductor field-<br>
effect-transistors," APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS. Vol. 74 No. 8, 22 Feb. 1999. pages<br>

Summary<br>
Given the literature on substrate doping profiles for conventional short channel<br>
MOS transistors and the scant work on channel doping profiles for short channel Schottky<br>
MOS devices, the proposed invention offers a novel and non-obvious approach with many<br>
advantages over the current state-of-the-art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the objects of the present invention are (among others) to circumvent<br>
the deficiencies in the prior art and affect one or more of the following objectives:<br>
1.	Provide a system and method to permit MOSFETs to be fabricated with short<br>
channel lengths with less cost, higher performance and better tolerances than<br>
current fabrication technologies.<br>
2.	Reduce parasitic bipolar operation in integrated MOSFETs, thus reducing the<br>
potential for latchup and other anomalous behavior.<br>
3.	Provide for MOSFET devices that have in some circumstances a higher degree of<br>
radiation hardness.<br>
While these objectives should not be understood to limit the teachings of the<br>
present invention, in general these objectives are achieved by the disclosed invention that<br>
is discussed in the following sections.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Overview<br>
Referencing FIG. 3, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention (300)<br>
consists simply of a conventional MOS gate stack (303) (gate electrode on silicon dioxide<br>
on a silicon substrate), metal source (301) and/or drain (302) electrodes, and channel<br><br>
dopants (304) that vary significantly in the vertical direction but not in the lateral<br>
direction. A field oxide (305) electrically isolates devices from each other.<br>
The Schottky (or Schottky-like) barriers (307, 308) that exist along the interface of<br>
the corresponding metal source/drain (301, 302) and the silicon substrate (306) act as an<br>
inherent pocket or halo implant and does so without added parasitic capacitance. It also<br>
eliminates the need for shallow source/drain extensions as the metal source/drain is by its<br>
nature shallow and highly conductive. Significant reductions in manufacturing complexity<br>
are therefore achieved by simultaneous elimination of the halo/pocket implants and the<br>
source/drain extensions. These are also major advantages over conventionally-architected-<br>
channel MOS devices.<br>
Due to the atomically abrupt nature of the Schottky barrier and the very consistent<br>
and repeatable magnitude of this barrier, two sources of statistical variation which are<br>
endemic to conventional MOS devices are virtually eliminated. The random statistical<br>
nature of dopant introduction via ion-implantation in conventional devices produces<br>
significant variations in the position and magnitude of implanted dopants. This is true for<br>
both the halo/pocket and source/drain dopants. The result is a certain amount of random<br>
variation in device parameters such as channel length (L), drive current, and leakage<br>
current. These variations make circuit design more difficult and contribute to<br>
manufacturing cost via yield loss due to ICs that do not meet performance specifications.<br>
The problem becomes more severe as channel lengths are reduced due to the smaller<br>
effective volume of silicon per device, and therefore less averaging to smooth away<br>
statistical variations.<br>
Because the metal source/drain (which replaces the conventional impurity doped<br>
source/drain) has a natural, very consistent and atomically abrupt Scotty barrier (307,308)<br><br>
with the silicon substrate (306) whose position and magnitude are independent of channel<br>
length, and because this barrier essentially plays the role of the halo/pocket implant<br>
(making these implants unnecessary), statistical variations due to random placement of<br>
atoms during the source/drain and halo/pocket implants are essentially eliminated. This<br>
fact remains true and even becomes more true as the channel length is reduced.<br>
Another benefit of the metal source/drain MOS architecture is the unconditional<br>
elimination of the parasitic bipolar gain. The parasitic bipolar gain is a direct result of<br>
using opposite doping types for the source/drain and substrate regions, and can result in<br>
latch-up and other deleterious effects. When the source/drain electrodes are constructed of<br>
metal, this parasitic gain is eliminated. This makes the metal source/drain architecture<br>
ideal for (among other things) high-radiation environments.<br>
General Advantages<br>
The present invention typically provides the following benefits as compared to the<br>
prior art:<br>
1.	Reduction in manufacturing complexity. Pocket/Halo implants and shallow<br>
source/drain extensions are not needed.<br>
2.	Reduction in capacitance due to absence of pocket/halo implants.<br>
3.	Reduction in random/statistical variations of device electrical characteristics due to<br>
absence of pocket/halo implants and course/drain extensions, and the use of metal<br>
for the source and drain.<br>
4.	Unconditional elimination of the parasitic bipolar gain and associated latchup.<br>
5.	Increased radiation hardness as compared to conventional MOS structures.<br>
The above list of advantages should not be interpreted as to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention. However, one skilled in the art will recognize a plethora of application<br><br>
opportunities for the present invention teachings given the above-mentioned list of general<br>
advantages that are potentially available.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments are Exemplary<br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is<br>
shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detailed preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an<br>
exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad<br>
aspect of the invention to the embodiment illustrated.<br>
The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described<br>
with particular reference to the presently preferred embodiments, wherein these innovative<br>
teachings are advantageously applied to the particular problems of a MOSFET DEVICE<br>
SYSTEM AND METHOD. However, it should be understood that these embodiments are<br>
only examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In<br><br>
general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily<br>
limit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to<br>
some inventive features but not to others. In general, unless otherwise indicated, singular<br>
elements may be in the plural and visa versa with no loss of generality.<br>
Definitions<br>
Throughout the discussion in mis document the following definitions will be<br>
utilized:<br>
System Blocks/Procedural Steps Not Limitive<br>
The present invention may be aptly described in terms of exemplary system block<br>
diagrams and procedural flowcharts. While these items are sufficient to instruct one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art the teachings of the present invention, they should not be strictly<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present invention. One skilled in the art will be<br>
aware that system block diagrams may be combined and rearranged with no loss of<br>
generality, and procedural steps may be added or subtracted, and rearranged in order to<br>
achieve the same effect with no loss of teaching generality. Thus, it should be understood<br>
that the present invention as depicted in the attached exemplary system block diagrams and<br>
procedural flowcharts is for teaching purposes only and may be reworked by one skilled in<br>
the art depending on the intended target application.<br>
Predetermined Regions<br>
Throughout the following discussion the term 'predetermined region' will be<br>
defined to encompass the area centered at the heart of the active device (MOSFET). Thus.<br>
all the process steps mentioned in the context of a MOSFET will create a gate.<br>
source/drain, and/or channel doping profiles as well as other structures in an area proximal<br><br>
to the predetermined regions or heart of the active device. The present invention places no<br>
restrictions on what occurs outside this context, far from the heart of the active device.<br>
It should be noted that while me predetermined region will generally be spoken of<br>
in terms of a MOSFET device, this in no way limits the scope of the present invention.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that any device capable of regulating the flow of<br>
electrical current may be considered to have a predetermined region in proximity to its<br>
active current carrying region.<br>

The present invention is particularly suitable for use with MOSFET semiconductor<br>
devices, but the use of the present teachings is not limited to this particular application.<br>
Other semiconductor devices, whether integrated or not, may be applied to the present<br>
invention teachings. Thus, while this specification speaks in terms of 'MOSFET' devices,<br>
this term should be interpreted broadly to include any device for regulating the flow of<br>
electrical current having a conducting channel that has two or more points of electrical<br>
contact.<br>
Channel Length Not Limitive<br>
The present invention is particularly suitable for use in situations where short<br>
channel length MOSFETs are to be fabricated, especially in the range of channel lengths<br>
the teachings of the present invention to these short channel length devices. Advantageous<br>
use of the teachings of the present invention may be had with channel lengths of any<br>
dimension.<br>
Dopants Not Limitive<br><br>
Throughout the discussion herein there will be examples provided that utilize<br>
various dopant technologies in regards to MOSFET device fabrication. These dopants are<br>
only illustrative of a specific embodiment of the present invention and should not be<br>
interpreted to be Limitive of the scope of teachings within the current invention.<br>
Note, however, that the present invention specifically anticipates the use of<br>
impurity atoms are selected from the group consisting of Arsenic, Phosphorous. Antimony,<br>
Boron, Indium, and/or Gallium as being within the scope of the teachings of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Device Type Not Limitive<br>
One skilled in the art will readily realize that the present invention is not limited in<br>
scope to either N-type or P-type devices but may be used with either or both device types.<br>
Source/Drain Not Limitive<br>
Throughout the discussion herein there will be examples provided that make<br>
reference to 'source' and 'drain' connections in regards to MOSFET device fabrication.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that in any given MOSFET configuration the<br>
nomenclature surrounding these contacts may be swapped without loss of generality, so<br>
that the 'source' may be interchanged with the 'drain' contact with no loss in the scope of<br>
the present invention. Additionally, one skilled in the art will recognize that while many<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention may be used to fabricate both source and<br>
drain connections, there is no requirement that this be the case in actual practice. One,<br>
both, or none of the source/drain connections on a given device in the context of an IC or<br>
the like may use the teachings of the present invention to advantage.<br>
Thus, the terms 'source' and 'drain' should be interpreted to include the variants<br>
'drain' and 'source' as well as 'source or drain' and 'source and drain'.<br><br>
Throughout the discussion herein there will be examples provided that make<br>
reference to metals in regards to MOSFET device fabrication. The present invention does<br>
not recognize any limitations in regards to what types of metals may be used in affecting<br>
the teachings of the present invention. Thus, metals commonly used at the transistor level<br>
such as titanium, cobalt and the like are specifically anticipated, as well as a plethora of<br>
more exotic metals and other alloys. Nothing in the disclosure limits the use of the<br>
invention with any particular metal or alloy. One skilled in the art will recognize mat any<br>
conductive interconnecting material may be used with no loss of generality in<br>
implementing the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Note, however, that the present invention specifically anticipates the use of<br>
source/drain electrodes formed from the group consisting of any of Platinum Silicide,<br>
Palladium Silicide, Iridium Silicide, and/or the rare-earth silicides as being within the<br>
scope of the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Schottky Not Limitive<br>
Throughout the discussion herein there will be examples provided that make<br>
reference to 'Schottky' barriers and like contacts in regards to IC fabrication. The present<br>
invention does not recognize any limitations in regards to what types of Schottky interfaces<br>
may be used in affecting the teachings of the present invention. Thus, the present<br>
invention specifically anticipates these types of junctions to be created with any form of<br>
conductive material.<br>
Additionally, while traditional Schottky junctions are abrupt, the present invention<br>
specifically anticipates that in some circumstances an interfacial layer may be utilized<br>
between the silicon substrate and the actual Schottky barrier metal. Thus, the present<br><br>
invention specifically anticipates 'Schottky-like' junctions and their equivalents to be<br>
useful in implementing the present invention. Furthermore, the interfacial layer may<br>
comprise materials that have conductive, semi-conductive, and/or insulator-like properties.<br>
Etching Technology Not Limitive<br>
Throughout the discussion herein there will be examples provided that make<br>
reference to a variety of etching technologies utilized to remove oxide and/or metal in the<br>
IC fabrication process. The present invention does not restrict the type of etching<br>
technology used to achieve the results illustrated in the typical process flows. These<br>
etching technologies are well known in the art.<br>
Process/Method<br>
One possible process flow for the fabrication of channel implanted, short channel<br>
(
exemplary process flow is just exemplary of the broad teachings of the present invention, it<br>
will prove very instructive to one skilled in the art to teach the fundamental concepts of the<br>
present invention. This exemplary process flow may be described as follows:<br>
1.	Referencing FIG. 4, starting with a silicon substrate (402) that has means for<br>
electrically isolating transistors from one another, a thin screen oxide (401) is<br>
grown (approximately 200 A) to act as an implant mask. The appropriate channel<br>
dopant species (403) (for example Arsenic and Indium for P-type and N-type<br>
devices respectively) is then ion-implanted through the screen oxide to a pre-<br>
determined depth in the silicon (approximately 1000 A or so).<br>
2.	Referencing FIG. 5, the screen oxide is then removed in hydro-fluoric acid, and a<br>
thin gate oxide (501) (approximately 35 A) is grown. The gate oxide growth is<br>
immediately followed by an in-situ doped silicon film. The film is heavily doped<br><br>
with, for example. Phosphorous for an N-type device and Boron for a P-type<br>
device. Using lithographic techniques and a silicon etch that is highly selective to<br>
oxide, the gate electrode (502) is patterned as shown in the process step (500)<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
3. A thin oxide (approximately 100 A) is then thermally grown on the top surface and<br>
sidewalls of the silicon gate electrode. Referencing FIG. 6, an anisotropic etch is<br>
then used to remove the oxide layers on the horizontal surfaces (and thus expose<br>
the silicon (601)), while preserving them on the vertical surfaces. In this way, a<br>
side wall oxide (602) is formed, and the dopants both in the gate electrode and in<br>
the channel region of the device are electrically activated as shown in the process<br>
step (600) illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
4. Referencing FIG. 7, the final step encompasses depositing an appropriate metal (for<br>
example. Platinum for the P-type device and Erbium for the N-type device) as a<br>
blanket film (approximately 400 Å) on all exposed surfaces. The wafer is men<br>
annealed for a specified time at a specified temperature (for example, 400 C for<br>
45 minutes) so that, at all places where the metal is in direct contact with the<br>
silicon, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the metal to a metal silicide<br>
(701). The metal that was in direct contact with a non-silicon surface (702) is left<br>
unaffected as shown in the process step (700) illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
5.	A wet chemical etch (aqua regia for Platinum, HNO3 for Erbium) is then used to<br>
remove the unreacted metal while leaving the metal-silicide untouched. The<br>
channel implanted, short channel Schottky barrier MOS device is now complete<br>
and ready for electrical contacting to gate, source and drain as shown in the<br>
process step (800) illustrated in FIG. S.<br><br>
This process is only one possible way to achieve channel implanted, metal<br>
source/drain Schottky MOS devices. One skilled in the art will recognize that many other<br>
variants and alternatives exist.<br>
Device/System<br>
FIG. 9 shows a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, as exemplified<br>
by two final complementary MOSFET structures (900). This embodiment consists of N-<br>
channel devices fabricated with Erbium Silicide (904) for the source/drain regions, and a<br>
P-channel device fabricated with Platinum Silicide (905).<br>
Vertically varying, laterally non-varying Indium (902) and Arsenic (903) layers are<br>
used as the channel dopants for the N-channel and P-channel devices respectively. These<br>
dopant atoms are used due to their relatively low rates of diffusion through the silicon<br>
lattice (compared to Phosphorous and Boron, the other two possible candidates for channel<br>
dopants). This allows for greater thermal budget during fabrication of the device, and<br>
therefore less statistical variation in the characteristics of the finished product.<br>
The gate electrodes are fabricated from in-situ Phosphorous and Boron doped<br>
polysilicon films for the N-type (906) and P-type (907) devices respectively. In this<br>
instance. Phosphorous and Boron are used due to their large solid-solubilities (compared to<br>
Arsenic and Indium). The electrodes are doped via the use of an in-situ method, wherein<br>
the impurity atoms are deposited at the same time the silicon atoms are. Such a method<br>
can achieve very large doping concentrations (approximately 1021/cm3) and a uniform<br>
distribution throughout the thickness of the film. Another option for doping the silicon<br>
gate is ion-implantation. This method suffers from several practical problems including<br>
charging damage to the thin gate oxide, and the need to redistribute the highly non-uniform<br>
as-implanted gate dopants to achieve high doping levels at the gate oxide interface.<br><br>
The gate electrodes (906) and (907) are less than 100 nm in width (corresponding<br>
to the channel length L), as it is in this regime that the advantages of the Schottky barrier<br>
architecture over the conventional architecture become apparent. These include simplified<br>
processing due to the absence of need for pocket implants, and the resulting reduction in<br>
yield loss, capacitance and statistical variations in finished products.<br>
Devices are separated from each other by a thermally grown oxide (called a Field<br>
Oxide) (901) that works in conjunction with the channel dopants to electrically isolate the<br>
devices from each other.<br>
While the above description contains many specifics, these should not be construed<br>
as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one<br>
preferred embodiment thereof. One skilled in the art will realize that many other<br>
variations are possible. For example, there are many possible candidates for the<br>
source/drain metal. It may also be advantageous to insert a thin oxide layer between the<br>
metal and the silicon substrate. The silicon substrate itself may be replaced by any number<br>
of other semiconductors. Additionally, boundaries between layers or elements can always<br>
be graded or interposed with other materials or interface agents to improve performance.<br>
Generalized Process/System Fabrication<br>
From the foregoing discussion, the process and system embodied in the present<br>
invention may be further generalized as illustrated in the flowcharts shown in FIGs. 10-11.<br>
generalized Process/System<br>
Referencing FIG. 10, an exemplary generalized MOSFET device process<br>
fabrication flow (1000) starts with a semiconductor substrate having means for electrically<br>
isolating transistors (1000). On this substrate, channel dopants are introduced in such a<br>
way that the dopant concentration varies significantly in the vertical but not the lateral<br><br>
direction (1002). Once this is complete, a gate electrode is formed (1003) on the silicon<br>
substrate. Finally, source and/or drain electrodes are formed, at least one of which<br>
incorporates a Schottky or Schottky-like contact to the semiconductor substrate (1004).<br>
Detailed Process/System<br>
Referencing FIG. 11. an exemplary detailed MOSFET device process fabrication<br>
flow (1100) starts with a semiconductor substrate having means for electrically isolating<br>
transistors (1101). On this substrate, channel dopants are introduced in such a way that the<br>
dopant concentration varies significantly in the vertical but not the lateral direction (1102).<br>
Once this is complete, a gate electrode insulator is formed by growing a thin gate<br>
insulating layer and depositing a conducting film (1103) on the silicon substrate.<br>
At this point a series of pattern and etching steps are performed to form a gate<br>
electrode (1104). Then one or more thin insulating layers are formed on one or more<br>
side walls of the gate electrode to selectively expose the semiconductor substrate on the<br>
active areas of the device except for the sidewalks (1105). A thin film of metal is deposited<br>
on all surfaces of the device (1106), and the device is thermally annealed to form a metal-<br>
semiconductor alloy on the exposed semiconductor surfaces (1107). Finally, unreacted<br>
metal is removed from the device while leaving the metal-semiconductor alloy untouched<br>
to form local interconnect for the formed device (1108).<br>
Summary<br>
In substance, the present invention may be summarized by noting that the basic<br>
structure is one in which the substrate between the source and drain is uniformly doped in<br>
the lateral direction, non-uniformly doped in the vertical direction, and that the source<br>
and/or drain electrodes form Schottky or Schottky-like contacts with the substrate.<br>
CONCLUSION<br><br>
A short channel length, laterally uniform doped channel, metal source and<br>
drain MOS device structure and method for manufacture has been disclosed. The<br>
present invention provides for many advantages over the prior art including lower<br>
manufacturing costs, superior device characteristics, and tighter control of device<br>
parameters. These advantages are achieved primarily through the introduction of a<br>
channel doping profile that is both laterally uniform and vertically non-uniform, in<br>
conjunction with metal source/drain regions, thus eliminating the need for halo/pocket<br>
implants and shallow source/drain extensions. The parasitic bipolar gain is<br>
unconditionally eliminated as well.<br>
These features of the invention make it ideal for many applications, including but<br>
not limited to high frequency and/or high radiation environments.<br><br>
