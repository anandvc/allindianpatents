				<td>A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR COLLECTING FRESH WATER<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
collecting fresh water coming from an undersea fresh<br>
water spring. The present invention also relates to a<br>
fresh water catchment device. Such fresh water springs<br>
are undersea resurgences of fresh water at the bottom of<br>
the sea.<br>
Various methods and devices are already known for<br>
collecting fresh water from undersea springs, such as<br>
those described in particular in French patent<br>
application FR 2 701 974 or in international application<br>
WO 00/79309 in the name of the Applicant.<br>
In those methods and devices, a tank structure<br>
having its concave side facing downwards is put into<br>
position over the fresh water spring, and the fresh water<br>
is trapped in the top portion of the tank structure<br>
because its density is lower than that of sea water.<br>
That structure has an open bottom so as to enable sea<br>
water to be evacuated and/or so as to enable it to be<br>
filled with fresh water.<br>
There are several difficulties in implementing a<br>
method and a device for collecting fresh water in<br>
satisfactory manner at sea.<br>
Firstly, it is necessary for the catchment device to<br>
be simple and easy to install on the sea bottom and to be<br>
inexpensive to make.<br>
Secondly, the method and the device for collecting<br>
fresh water must avoid mixing between the fresh water and<br>
sea water so as to ensure that pure fresh water is<br>
collected.<br>
Finally, it is necessary to ensure that the method<br>
and device do not disturb the hydraulic load on the fresh<br>
water spring. The fresh water from an undersea spring<br>
makes its way through natural underground ducts, and it<br>
is possible to disturb the spring and possibly to<br>
interrupt it irreparably by exerting excessive hydraulic<br>
back pressure on the flow orifice of the spring, leading<br><br>
to damage or modifications in said natural underground<br>
ducts that are fragile. For any given spring,<br>
hydrogeologists can determine a value for a limited back<br>
pressure that can be tolerated and that should not be<br>
exceeded in order to avoid disturbing the flow from said<br>
spring, with said hydraulic back pressure generally lying<br>
in the range 0 to 0.1 (104 pascals (Pa)).<br>
In the absence of any catchment device, the<br>
hydraulic pressure at the outflow orifice from the fresh<br>
water spring depends on the depth of water situated above<br>
said orifice, where this pressure increases at a rate of<br>
1 bar per 10 meters of depth. This hydraulic pressure is<br>
independent of the natural flow rate of the spring.<br>
However, in the presence of a catchment device, head<br>
losses arise due to friction acting on the water flowing<br>
through the device. The friction head loss is<br>
proportional to the rate the water flows through the<br>
catchment device. Fresh water springs can be subject to<br>
natural variations in flow rate, in particular in the<br>
event of flooding, and such variations can amount to the<br>
flow rate being multiplied by a factor of 5 or even 10.<br>
These variations in flow rate lead to hydraulic back<br>
pressure in the spring due to the increase in head loss<br>
associated with the water passing through the ducts of<br>
the catchment device, when installed..<br>
More generally, and in practice, it is difficult to<br>
combine the two conditions of not mixing sea water with<br>
the fresh water and of avoiding excessive hydraulic back<br>
pressure in the spring while nevertheless implementing a<br>
catchment device that is simple and inexpensive to make<br>
and to install, and that is technically reliable, without<br>
requiring any energy to be supplied, e.g. for pumping.<br>
The methods and devices described in FR 2 701 974<br>
are specially adapted to collecting fresh water along the<br>
coast and cannot be used with springs situated far out to<br>
sea, at the sea bottom and at a great distance from the<br>
coast. In any event, those collection methods and<br><br>
devices do not make it possible to avoid mixing between<br>
salt sea water and fresh water while it is being<br>
collected.<br>
In WO 00/79309, various methods and devices for<br>
collecting fresh water are described, in which fresh<br>
water is collected in an open-bottomed tank in the form<br>
of a bell or cap overlying the fresh water spring at the<br>
bottom of the sea, together with a pipe rising from the<br>
top of said tank to the surface of the sea.<br>
In a first embodiment of WO 00/79309, the open<br>
bottom of the tank is moored to the sea bottom at a<br>
certain distance above the sea bottom, thus making it<br>
easier to install the device in the event of the sea<br>
bottom being cluttered, e.g. by rocks or uneven relief.<br>
Under such conditions, it is nevertheless not possible in<br>
practice to avoid sea water mixing with fresh water<br>
inside the tank.<br>
In a second embodiment of WO 00/79309, the open<br>
bottom of the tank fits against the sea bottom in<br>
leaktight manner so as to avoid salt sea water mixing<br>
with the fresh water after an initial stage of emptying<br>
the tank which is initially filled with sea water. In<br>
that second embodiment, check valves are provided to<br>
allow water to be exhausted in the event of the flow rate<br>
from the spring increasing, thereby avoiding excessive<br>
hydraulic back pressure being applied to the spring.<br>
Nevertheless, the flow rate increases that occur in<br>
practice are such that it is necessary to provide a very<br>
large number of check valves. Unfortunately, these<br>
valves are relatively fragile mechanical devices that are<br>
calibrated for a given flow rate, and they also increase<br>
the cost of the device. Those collection methods and<br>
devices are therefore unsatisfactory, both from an<br>
economic point of view and from a technical point of<br>
view. In addition, the catchment device is not easy to<br>
install when the sea bottom close to the spring is not<br>
level since, under those circumstances, it is difficult<br><br>
to provide leaktightness between the sea bottom and the<br>
open bottom of the tank, which has a diameter that is<br>
relatively large.<br>
To summarize, prior methods and devices for<br>
collecting undersea fresh water present the following<br>
omissions and drawbacks:<br>
•	either the system is completely leaktight against<br>
salt water, but any increase in the flow rate of fresh<br>
water in the event of flooding (where the flow rate can<br>
vary in a ratio of 1 to 10 over a few hours) leads to an<br>
increase in head loss associated with friction and to a<br>
rise in the hydraulic pressure in the spring that can<br>
lead to irreparable damage in the natural duct;<br>
•	or the system requires open surfaces to be present<br>
in the surrounding salt water whenever it is episodically<br>
evacuating excess fresh water, thereby leading to<br>
contamination at the fresh water/salt water interface;<br>
and<br>
•	finally, pumping in those prior systems can lead<br>
to negative pressure variations in the event of an<br>
increase in the flow rate of the spring, and can thus<br>
lead to a phenomenon whereby salt water is sucked in and<br>
then pollutes the pipe upstream.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to<br>
provide methods and devices for collecting fresh water<br>
that are simple and inexpensive to make and install, that<br>
operate in a manner that is technically reliable over<br>
time and that combine the advantages of no mixing of sea<br>
water and fresh water, with no risk of excessive<br>
hydraulic back pressure in the spring, so as to avoid<br>
irreparably damaging the natural ducts, and that does not<br>
require any energy to be supplied, in particular by<br>
pumping.<br>
To do this, in a first aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a method of collecting fresh water coming from<br>
an undersea fresh water spring at the bottom of the sea,<br>
in which the fresh water is collected in a first duct t1<br><br>
whose bottom end is placed facing said spring and<br>
surrounds in leaktight manner at least part and<br>
preferably all of the orifice of said spring. According<br>
to the method of the invention, the fresh water is<br>
collected at a rate that is less than or equal to a given<br>
rate and in a second duct t2 of diameter smaller than the<br>
diameter of said first duct, the second duct having its<br>
top end opening out at the surface and its bottom end<br>
extending inside said first duct over a length l and<br>
when the flow rate from the spring exceeds said given<br>
rate, the excess flow from the spring overflows from the<br>
top end of said first duct into an open-bottomed tank<br>
containing air, said tank holding air captive above an<br>
air/water interface situated inside said tank, and the<br>
top end of said first duct being situated beneath the<br>
level of said air/water interface inside said tank. It<br>
will be understood that the top end of said first duct<br>
opens out into the inside of said tank.<br>
This avoids any contact, and thus any pollution,<br>
between the fresh water and the salt water, while also<br>
limiting the hydraulic back pressure on the spring that<br>
is generated by the device.<br>
In a preferred implementation, the fresh water is<br>
collected at the end of said second duct at a rate<br>
corresponding to the mean flow rate of said fresh water<br>
spring.<br>
As explained below, said first duct tx is dimensioned<br>
and the value of H is determined in such a manner that:<br>
P1 X g X H + G + P1 
where:<br>
•	P1 = density of fresh water;<br>
•	g = 9.81 meters per second per second (m/s2) ;<br>
•	P1 = head loss in said first duct when the fresh<br>
water flows at said given, flow rate, in particular the<br>
mean flow rate of the spring;<br>
•	APS = the limiting hydraulic back pressure that<br>
can be tolerated by said fresh water spring; this is a<br><br>
value that known or that can be determined for any<br>
spring, where APS is prefercably less than or equal to<br>
104 Pa; and<br>
•	G = the Archimedes' thrust gain associated with<br>
the phenomenon of replacing the weight of a column of sea<br>
water with the weight of the column of fresh water in<br>
said first duct.<br>
This gain G can be written as follows:<br>
G = (p1 X g X H1) - (p2 X g X H1)<br>
where:<br>
•	H1 = the height of the air/water interface in the<br>
tank relative to the sea bottom at the spring; and<br>
•	p2 = the density of sea water.<br>
The height H and the dimensions of the first duct<br>
are thus determined as a function of APS.<br>
According to another preferred characteristic of the<br>
method, in order to ensure that the second pipe t2 remains<br>
continuously in contact with the water flowing in said<br>
first duct t1 said length t is greater than or equal to<br>
H.<br>
In general, the limiting hydraulic back pressure<br>
(APS) that can be tolerated at the spring is less than<br>
equal to 0.1 bar (104 Pa).<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the present<br>
invention provides a devices for collecting fresh water<br>
coming from an undersea fresh water spring and that is<br>
suitable for use in a method of the invention, the device<br>
comprising:<br>
•	a first duct t1 of diameter at its bottom end<br>
enabling it to cover said spring in full or in part;<br>
•	a second duct t2 of diameter at its bottom portion<br>
less than the diameter of the top portion of said first<br>
duct t1; and<br>
•	an open-bottomed tank suitable for co-operating<br>
with said second duct t2 in such a manner that when the<br>
bottom end of said second duct t2 is immersed inside said<br>
first duct, itself being positioned facing said spring,<br><br>
with its bottom end surrounding said spring in leaktight<br>
manner in full or in part, then the top end of said first<br>
duct t1 is covered by said tank and opens out to the<br>
inside thereof via said open bottom, the solid wall of<br>
said tank being leaktight so as to be capable of holding<br>
air captive between said tank wall and the level of water<br>
inside said tank.<br>
In particular and advantageous embodiments of the<br>
device of the invention:<br>
•	the device includes first mooring means for<br>
mooring said first duct t1 to the sea bottom and/or to a<br>
baseblock resting on the sea bottom, and second mooring<br>
means for mooring said second duct and/or said tank as<br>
moored in this way to the sea bottom and/or to said first<br>
duct;<br>
•	said tank is secured to said second duct and<br>
surrounds it in leaktight manner;<br>
•	said tank is constituted by a canopy, which may in<br>
particular be flexible or rigid, and that has said second<br>
duct t2 passing through it in leaktight manner;<br>
•	said canopy has a top portion in the form of a<br>
substantially hemispherical cap or bell;<br>
•	said flexible canopy is suitable for adopting the<br>
shape of a substantially hemispherical cap or bell at the<br>
bottom of the sea when it is moored and compressed air is<br>
injected under said canopy;<br><br>
•	the device includes means for injecting compressed<br>
air into the inside of said tank;<br>
•	the diameter of the open bottom of said tank is<br>
such that the area of its opening is not less than the<br>
section area of the spring;<br>
•	the length of said first duct t1 is greater than or<br>
equal to the height of natural or other objects and/or<br>
relief lying on the sea bottom in the vicinity of said<br>
undersea spring in a radius corresponding to that of the<br>
open bottom of the tank;<br><br>
•	the top portion of Said first duct t1 surrounding<br>
the bottom portion of said second pipe is flared, being<br>
funnel-shaped, with its smaller base at the bottom; this<br>
embodiment encourages good overflow of the excess fresh<br>
water into the tank, whenever that is necessary;<br>
•	the diameter D1 of said first duct t1 at the bottom<br>
end of said second duct t2 is such that the annular area<br>
between said first and second ducts at this level is<br>
greater than or equal to the section area of said first<br>
duct (i.e. greater than D12/4 for a circular section);<br>
•	said second duct rises directly to the surface,<br>
preferably substantially vertically from the top end of<br>
said first duct, and the fresh water is recovered at the<br>
surface and transported to land, preferably by ship; and<br>
•	said second duct can be lowered to rest on the sea<br>
bottom so as to reach the coast, thereby conveying the<br>
water to the coast, preferably opening out on land at an<br>
altitude that is lower than sea level..<br>
The present invention also provides a method of<br>
putting a fresh water collection device into place, the<br>
method being characterized in that the following steps<br>
are performed:<br>
1)	positioning said first pipe t1 above said undersea<br>
fresh water spring and mooring said first pipe t1 to the<br>
sea bottom in such a manner that the bottom end of said<br>
first pipe t1 surrounds said fresh water spring in<br>
leaktight manner in full or in part;<br>
2)	lowering said second pipe t2 and said tank to the<br>
sea bottom and mooring them to the sea bottom and/or to<br>
said first pipe t1 in such a manner that the bottom end of<br>
said second pipe t2 is contained inside the top portion of<br>
said first pipe t1; and<br>
3)	injecting air into the inside of said tank in<br>
such a manner as to obtain an air/water interface at the<br>
top portion of said first pipe at a said height for the<br>
air/water interface inside said tank, preferably at a<br>
said height H.<br><br>
The method and device of the invention for<br>
collecting fresh water are advantageous on several<br>
grounds.<br>
Firstly, they enable fresh water to be collected<br>
while preventing any contact and thus any mixing between<br>
fresh water and salt water, thereby serving to collect<br>
fresh water that is pure. The air inside the tank<br>
creates an interface through which the salt water cannot<br>
pass, so it cannot contaminate the fresh water that is<br>
collected via said second duct t2.<br>
Secondly, the method and the device of the invention<br>
enable fresh water to be collected, with fresh water<br>
being collected at a substantially constant rate and<br>
without any risk of excessive back pressure, thereby<br>
avoiding any hydrogeologcil disturbance to the spring<br>
that might result therefrom, and this is achieved without<br>
using any mechanical means for regulating the rate of<br>
flow inside said first and second ducts, i.e. means such<br>
as exhaust check valves, and in particular means at the<br>
junction between said first and second ducts or in the<br>
tank.<br>
Overall, the method and the device of the invention<br>
enable the rate of flow taken from the spring and the<br>
hydraulic load on the outlet of the spring to be adjusted<br>
independently of the natural flow rate of the spring,<br>
while avoiding any risk of salt water penetrating into<br>
the pipe leading to land via said second duct in the<br>
event of excessive pumping, with this being achieved by<br>
control means based on a principle that is hydraulic and<br>
not mechanical, and thus without requiring additional<br>
mechanical control means to be implemented.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, if the fresh water flows from<br>
the spring at a rate exceeding the given limit rate, then<br>
it can follow two paths at the top end of said first<br>
pipe, namely:<br><br>
•	a first path C2 whereby it rises to the surface via<br>
said second duct t2 at the given rate, preferably the mean<br>
delivery rate of the spring; and<br>
•	a second path C1 whereby it passes into the annular<br>
space inside said first duct t1 and outside said second<br>
duct t2 at a rate that corresponds to the difference<br>
between the delivery rate of the spring and said given<br>
rate.<br>
It is possible to determine the dimensions of the<br>
ducts t1 and t2 and the height H between the air/water<br>
interface in the tank and the top end of the first pipe<br>
in such a manner that when the flow rate from the spring<br>
corresponds to the desired extraction rate, in particular<br>
to the mean flow rate of the spring, then all of the<br>
fresh water follows the path C2 via said second duct and<br>
the back pressure at the spring remains less than or<br>
equal to the limiting back pressure that the spring can<br>
tolerate.<br>
Adjusting the height H of the interface has a direct<br>
influence on the flow rate passing into the second duct t2<br>
and also on the value of the back pressure applied to the<br>
spring.<br>
In practice, it is possible to proceed as follows:<br>
1)	the mean flow rate of the spring is measured; and<br>
2)	the height H is determined in such a manner that<br>
the expression<br>
P1 x g x H + G + P1 
is true.<br>
The head losses P1 in said first pipe t1 are<br>
associated with the shape and, of course, the surface<br>
state of the material constituting the inside walls of<br>
said ducts, and also on the speed of the water flowing in<br>
said first pipe.<br>
Thus, when there are floods and the flow rate of<br>
fresh water from the spring increases, it is observed<br>
that the rate flowing through said second duct t2 is<br>
constant regardless of the flow rate from the spring, and<br><br>
the height H remains constant, with the excess flow<br>
passing along said second path C1. The fresh water flows<br>
out from the top end of said first duct t1 into the air<br>
along the outside wall of said first duct t1 and then into<br>
the salt water at the air/water interface in the bottom<br>
portion of said tank, thus having the effect of expelling<br>
an equivalent quantity of water through the bottom<br>
portion of said tank, with the volume of air thus<br>
remaining constant inside said tank and with the<br>
hydraulic back pressure that can be accepted by the<br>
spring never being exceeded.<br>
The value H remains constant. Nevertheless, in the<br>
event of water being extracted accidentally at a rate<br>
greater than the natural delivery rate from the spring,<br>
the fresh water level in the top portion of said first<br>
duct will go down and pass beneath the bottom end of said<br>
second duct t2, thereby having the effect of causing air<br>
to enter into said second duct t2 (3) and not salt water<br>
since the system becomes temporarily unprimed.<br>
In practice, said tank is lowered to the sea bottom<br>
while it contains no air and thus while it is full of sea<br>
water, and when it is in position over the top end of<br>
said first duct t1, air is injected into the inside of the<br>
tank and it is the quantity of air injected into said<br>
tank that serves to adjust the height H.<br>
It will be understood that the shape and the<br>
magnitude of the volume of said tank have no effect on<br>
the hydraulic catchment principle applied to the fresh<br>
water, so they are as small as possible and best adapted<br>
to the ease with which said tank can be installed on the<br>
sea bottom.<br>
The bottom end of said first duct is sealed by<br>
ensuring that the periphery of the duct matches the<br>
outline of the relief of the sea bottom around the<br>
spring. Said first duct can be held to the sea bottom by<br>
ballast weights or by a peripheral fender resting on the<br>
bottom.<br><br>
To minimize head losses in the first duct t1 and thus the<br>
back pressure they induce on the: spring, it is advantageous to<br>
use a pipe t1 that is as short as possible and of the greatest<br>
possible diameter. In practice, the first pipe t1 extends over<br>
a height of water that is preferably greater than the altitude<br>
of the relief on the sea bottom in the immediate vicinity of<br>
the spring and/or of obstacles and clutter, whether natural or<br>
otherwise, as constituted mainly by rocks.<br>
The open bottom of the tank can thus be secured to the<br>
sea bottom and/or to said first, pipe, where it is free at a<br>
certain distance above the spring, and in particular above<br>
said relief and/or objects, whether natural or otherwise, in<br>
the vicinity of the spring.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention appear in the light of the following detailed<br>
description of an embodiment made with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 show<br>
respectively a catchment device: installed on the sea bottom<br>
over an undersea fresh water spring (Figure 1), and the tank 4<br>
(Figure 2).<br>
A fresh water catchment device has been made that is<br>
adapted to collect fresh water from the so-called "la Mortola"<br>
spring situated in Italy between Menton and Vintimille. That<br>
spring presents an average fresh water flow rate of 100 liters<br>
per second (L/s). Hydrogeologists have determined that the<br>
maximum hydraulic back pressure that that spring can tolerate<br>
is 0.1 bar. That spring is situated at a depth of 36 meters<br>
(m) and its orifice opens out at the base of blocks of rock<br>
that are 5 m high. It is situated at 800 m from the shore.<br>
Given the configuration of the orifice of the spring<br>
and the obstacles surrounding said orifice on the sea<br>
bottom, a first duct t1 (2) having a total height of<br>
7 m was used, presenting a main tubular portion with<br>
a circular section having a diameter of 0.4 m. Said first<br>
duct t1 (2) was terminated at its bottom end 2, by a<br><br>
downwardly-flared funnel, having a bottom end in the form<br>
of a circle of diameter 1.3 m, so as to ensure that said<br>
spring was indeed surrounded, given the shape of the<br>
outlet orifice from the spring. The bottom first funnel<br>
21 is made of rigid sheet material, which could be plastic<br>
or metal, surrounding the circular end of the main -<br>
portion of said first duct t1 (2) at its bottom end. _Said<br>
bottom funnel 21 has a height of 4 m.<br>
In its top portion, said first duct t1 (2) presents a<br>
second funnel 22 having minor and major bases that are<br>
circular in section, likewise made by disposing metal<br>
sheet or thermoformed plastic around the top end portion<br>
of said first duct. The upwardly-flared shape of the top<br>
portion of said first duct is to facilitate overflow of<br>
the excess fresh water from the spring inside the tank 4.<br>
The open bottom base of the first funnel 21 is<br>
secured to a baseblock 8 resting on the sea bottom and<br>
surrounding the spring. It could also be surrounded by a<br>
fender of sand or concrete or by some other peripheral<br>
ballast weight for establishing leaktightness relative to<br>
the sea bottom. The main portion of said first duct t1<br>
(2) could be constituted by a flexible hose or a rigid<br>
pipe. It extends vertically upwards from said spring.<br>
Said tank 4 is constituted by a rigid top canopy 41<br>
pierced in its center by a second duct t2 (3) that is<br>
preferably rigid, and has a diameter of 0.4 m.<br>
The rigid canopy constituting the top portion of<br>
said tank 4 forms a hemispherical cap 41 of diameter 1.8m<br>
and its bottom is extended by a frustoconical surface<br>
referred to below as a cone 42 that presents a height of<br>
2 m around said first duct. It is through the open<br>
bottom of said cone 42 that surplus fresh water escapes in<br>
the event of flooding from the spring. In Figure 1, the<br>
base of the cone 42 is held by mooring means 72 to said<br>
first duct t1 (2) in such a manner that the base of said<br>
cone is situated at a height of 5 m above the sea bottom.<br><br>
The presence of the cone 42 is optional. It is<br>
possible for the bottom of the cap 41 to be moored<br>
directly to said first duct.<br>
The portion of said second duct t2 (3) situated<br>
inside said tank 4 has a length of 1 m.<br>
When 2 m3 of compressed air is injected under said<br>
canopy constituting the tank 4, after its open bottom 43<br>
has been moored to the sea bottom or to the first duct, a<br>
length l of 0.3 m of the bottom portion 31 of said second<br>
duct t2 (3) can be inserted into the top portion of said<br>
first duct t1 (2).<br>
The height H between the air/water interface 6<br>
inside the tank 4 and the air/water interface at the top<br>
end of said top funnel 22 of said first duct t1 (2) is<br>
0.2 m.<br>
The bottom end 31 of said second duct t2 (3) has webs<br>
or gussets 9 at its periphery serving to reinforce and to<br>
center said bottom end of the second duct inside said<br>
funnel 21 at the top end of said first duct.<br>
About halfway up said first duct, Figure 1 shows a<br>
flow meter 10. It is the characteristics of the flow<br>
meter 10 that led to a portion of said first duct t1 (2)<br>
being narrower at this level, simply for the purpose of<br>
matching a flow meter 10 that was available.<br>
Reinforcing elements 71 are also fitted to the base<br>
of said first duct t1 (2) and serve likewise for mooring<br>
purposes by being bolted to a baseblock 8 surrounding the<br>
outlet from the spring 1 in leaktight manner.<br>
The value for H and the dimensioning of said first<br>
and second pipes 2 and 3 and also of the volume of<br>
compressed air injected into said tank 4 were determined<br>
as follows:<br>
When the spring is in flood and its delivery rate<br>
exceeds 100 L/s, in particular when it reaches its<br>
maximum rate of 500 L/s, the flow passing along said pipe<br>
t2 via the path C2 remains at about the mean rate of<br>
100 L/s, while the flow of fresh water following the path<br><br>
C1 in the annular space between the bottom end of said<br>
second pipe t2 and the top end of said first pipe t1<br>
generally has a maximum value of 400 L/s. The spring<br>
water rising along said first duct t1 (2) encounters two<br>
possible paths C1 and C2 at the base of said second duct<br>
t2 (3).<br>
Via the path C1, the fresh water overflows from the<br>
top end of said first duct t1 (2) and flows in air along<br>
the outside wall of said top second funnel 22 and then<br>
flows into the salt water, thereby expelling a quantity<br>
of fresh water through the bottom portion of the tank<br>
such that the volume of compressed air 5 contained in the<br>
tank 4 remains constant, as does the height H.<br>
Via the path C2, the fresh water passes into said<br>
second duct t2 (3) flowing at the spring's mean rate of<br>
100 L/s, given the dimensioning of said first pipe and<br>
the determined value H, and also because the maximum<br>
hydraulic back pressure that can be tolerated by the<br>
spring is 0.1 bar.<br>
The fresh water always follows the path that<br>
presents it with the least "resistance". For the path C1<br>
this "resistance", starting from the air/water interface,<br>
is essentially determined by the energy p1gH where p1 =<br>
the density of fresh water, and g = 9.81 m/s2. It can<br>
thus be seen that when H increases, passage via C2 is<br>
encouraged.<br>
For the path C2, the "resistance" encountered by the<br>
fresh water, when flowing along the pipe t2, is equal to<br>
the head losses generated by its flow in said pipe t2, but<br>
is calculated in conventional manner as a function of the<br>
diameter and the length of said pipe t2 and of the flow<br>
rate.<br>
The rigid canopy 41 and the cone 42 constituting said<br>
tank 4 can be made of a plastics material, a composite<br>
material, or of steel.<br>
 As mentioned above, this fresh water catchment<br>
system can operate without a pump since given that the<br><br>
density of fresh water is less than that of sea water,<br>
the fresh water rises naturally to the surface.<br>
Nevertheless, if the second duct t2 (3) is taken back<br>
down to the sea bottom in order to reach the coast, then<br>
the altitude at which said second duct t2 (3) opens out<br>
must be far enough below sea level in order to compensate<br>
at least for the head losses in the pipe t2.<br><br>
