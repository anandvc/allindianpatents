				<td>COWL. FOR MOTORCYCLE AMD MOTORCYCLE<br>
This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-284229 filed on October 31, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cowl for a motorcycle<br>
and a motorcycle, and in particular, to the structure of a cowl<br>
for a motorcycle that covers the side portion of a motorcycle.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Of cowls (exterior covers) for covering a motorcycle, a<br>
cowl having an opening for exhausting heat generated by heat<br>
generating parts such as a radiator, an engine, an air exhaust<br>
pipe, and the like to the side of a vehicle has been known as<br>
a side cowl for covering the side portion of the vehicle. To<br>
effectively exhaust the heat from the opening like this, in<br>
most of related side cowls, the side cowl has a depression<br>
formed on its surface, the depression being extended rearward<br>
of the vehicle from the position of the opening. With this,<br>
a negative pressure is produced in the opening to form an air<br>
flow going outside the cowl from inside the cowl (see<br>
JP-A-2001-80559 and JP-A-9-76967 to be described below).<br>
However, in the related side cowl, a higher priority is<br>
assigned to the reduction of a vehicle width, which results<br>
 <br>
in disposing the side cowl in such a way that the side cowl<br>
is brought into a press contact with a vehicle body. Thus,<br>
this makes it difficult to form a sufficiently deep depression<br>
and hence a negative pressure produced is not sufficiently<br>
large. On the other hand, when a side cowl is expanded outward<br>
to form a sufficiently deep depression, a problem that the side<br>
cowl is not sufficient in strength will be easily presented.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
above-mentioned problem. The object of the present invention<br>
is to provide: a cowl for a motorcycle that can acquire a<br>
sufficient heat exhaust effect and that can ensure a sufficient<br>
strength; and a motorcycle including the cowl for a motorcycle.<br>
To solve the above-mentioned problem, a cowl for a<br>
motorcycle according to the present invention includes: a duct<br>
that is arranged on a side portion of the motorcycle and<br>
extended in a vehicle width direction and which has an inside<br>
opening and an outside opening formed therein, the inside<br>
opening being positioned inside in the vehicle width direction<br>
and facing inward of a vehicle body, the outside opening being<br>
positioned outside in the vehicle width direction and facing<br>
outward of the vehicle body; and a panel for covering a portion<br>
of the outside opening, and wherein a portion not covered by<br>
the panel of the outside opening when viewed from a side is<br>
 <br>
hidden by the panel when viewed from a front.<br>
According to the present invention, the strength of the<br>
cowl for a motorcycle can be ensured by the duct extended in<br>
the vehicle width direction. Moreover, the portion not<br>
covered by the panel of the outside opening when viewed from<br>
a side is hidden by the panel when viewed from a front, so that<br>
a sufficient negative pressure is produced at the portion and<br>
hence a sufficient air flow for cooling can be formed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
 <br>
be described in detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a front view<br>
of the motorcycle. Fig. 3 is a side view to show the vicinity<br>
of a side cowl of the motorcycle on an enlarged scale. Fig.<br>
4 is an end view, taken on a cut line IV - IV in Fig. 3, of<br>
the side cowl. Fig. 5 is an end view, taken on a cut line V<br>
- V in Fig. 3, of the side cowl. Fig. 6 is an enlarged<br>
perspective view when the side cowl portion of the motorcycle<br>
is viewed obliquely from the left and rearward of the vehicle.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, in a motorcycle 10 according to this<br>
embodiment, a front fork 14 for rotatably supporting the axle<br>
of a front wheel 12 has a handlebar 16 fixed to the top portion<br>
thereof, and the direction of the front wheel 12 can be operated<br>
to the left and right by the handlebar 16. The front fork 14<br>
has a fender 18 fixed thereto, the fender 18 covering the upper<br>
portion of the front wheel 12. A front cowl 20 including a<br>
head light 20a and a windbreak plate 20b is disposed forward<br>
of the handlebar 16.<br>
A head pipe 24a for supporting the handlebar 16 is arranged<br>
downward of the handlebar 16, and a pair of left and right<br>
vehicle body frames 24, 24 are extended rearward and downward<br>
from this head pipe 24a. A fuel tank 26 is disposed upward<br>
of the vehicle body frames 24, 24, and a rider's seat 28 is<br>
disposed rearward of the fuel tank 26. An engine 30 driven<br>
 <br>
by gasoline supplied from the fuel tank 26 is suspended by the<br>
vehicle body frames 24, 24, and the lower portion of the engine<br>
30 is covered by an under cowl 32.<br>
The drive force of the engine 30 is transmitted to a rear<br>
wheel 34 via a chain (not shown). The rear wheel 34 has its<br>
axle supported by a swing arm 38 supported by a pivot 36 so<br>
as to be freely swung, the pivot 36 being disposed in the rear<br>
end portions of the vehicle body frames 24, 24 . This can drive<br>
the motorcycle 10 forward while moving up and down the rear<br>
wheel 34 according to the state of a road surface. A radiator<br>
40 is disposed forward of the engine 30 so as to face forward<br>
of the vehicle, and this radiator 40 cools the cooling water<br>
of the engine 30 by the running wind.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 10 has a side cowl 29 fixed thereto,<br>
the side cowl 29 including an inner side cowl 22 and an outer<br>
side cowl 23 that cover both side portions of the vehicle. The<br>
inner side cowl 22 and the outer side cowl 23 are separate<br>
members molded of resin. A fixing seat 22e molded on the inner<br>
side cowl 22 is fixed to the inside of the outer side cowl 23<br>
by a bolt, whereby both side cowls 22, 23 are integrally fixed.<br>
The outer side cowl 23 has flashers 25, 25 fixed thereto.<br>
The inner side cowl 22 has a duct 22c molded integrally,<br>
the duct 22c being extended in a vehicle width direction and<br>
having the cross-sectional area of its opening enlarged<br>
outward. The duct 22c has an inside opening 22a formed at an<br>
 <br>
inside end in the vehicle width direction thereof, the inside<br>
opening 22a facing inward of a vehicle body. The duct 22c has<br>
an outside opening 22b formed at an outside end in the vehicle<br>
width direction thereof, the outside opening 22b facing<br>
outward of the vehicle body and being larger than the inside<br>
opening 22a. The inside opening 22a is positioned inside the<br>
outside opening 22b when the motorcycle 10 is viewed from the<br>
side. Moreover, an edge portion 22f is extended from the<br>
peripheral edge of the outside opening 22b, and the upper<br>
portion of the edge portion 22f covers a portion of the vehicle<br>
body frame 24 when the motorcycle 10 is viewed from the side.<br>
The inside opening 22a is formed in a shape extended downward<br>
and rearward of the vehicle body along the vehicle body frame<br>
24 . The inside opening 22a has its upper edge positioned below<br>
the bottom surface of the vehicle body frame 24 having its cross<br>
section formed in a nearly rectangular shape. Moreover,<br>
similarly, the outside opening 22b is formed also in a shape<br>
extended downward and rearward of the vehicle body along the<br>
vehicle body frame 24. The outside opening 22b has its upper<br>
edge positioned above the bottom surface of the vehicle body<br>
frame 24 (see Fig. 3). For this reason, the heated air from<br>
the engine 30 and the radiator 40 can be smoothly introduced<br>
upward of the vehicle body frame 24 by the duct 22c.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, the inside opening<br>
22a of the inner side cowl 22 faces the engine 30, specifically.<br>
 <br>
between a cylinder head 30a and the radiator 40, and hence the<br>
heated air from the engine 30 and the radiator 40 can be quickly<br>
introduced into the inside opening 22a. Further, as shown in<br>
Fig. 5, the inside opening 22a has its edge on the rear side<br>
of the vehicle positioned a distance d further inside than its<br>
edge on the front side of the vehicle. That is, the direction<br>
in which the inside opening 22a faces is inclined to the vehicle<br>
side. With this, the running wind is smoothly taken into the<br>
inside opening 22a to form an air flow passing through the duct<br>
22c (see an arrow H shown in the drawing).<br>
Furthermore, the outer side cowl 23 is formed nearly in<br>
the shape of a hook larger than the inner side cowl 22 and is<br>
greatly bent in the up and down direction of the vehicle and<br>
in the front and rear direction of the vehicle (see Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 4, and Fig. 5). Still further, the outer side cowl 23<br>
has a step 23a formed on its upper portion, the step 23a<br>
protruding into outward of the periphery of the outer side cowl<br>
23. In this manner, the outer side cowl 23 is formed in a shape<br>
protruded outward in the vehicle width direction.<br>
The outer side cowl 23 is arranged at a position shifted<br>
further forward of the vehicle and downward of the vehicle than<br>
the inner side cowl 22. The outer side cowl 23 covers a portion<br>
forward of the vehicle and downward of the vehicle of the<br>
outside opening 22b of the inner side cowl 22 when the<br>
motorcycle 10 is viewed from the side. Thus, a portion not<br>
 <br>
covered by the outer side cowl 23 of the outside opening 22b,<br>
that is, a portion rearward of the vehicle and upward of the<br>
vehicle of the outside opening 22b is exposed outside in the<br>
vehicle width direction when the motorcycle is viewed from the<br>
side. The portion is an exhaust port 27 of the heated air from<br>
the engine 30 and the radiator 40. The upper edge of the outer<br>
side cowl 23 is extended rearward and downward along the vehicle<br>
body frame 24 . On the other hand, as described above, the upper<br>
edge of the outside opening 22b of the inner side cowl 22 is<br>
also extended rearward and downward along the vehicle body<br>
frame 24. For this reason, an outlet 27 is extended rearward<br>
and downward along the vehicle body frame 24. In this manner,<br>
the exhaust port 27 is formed so as to avoid the vehicle body<br>
frame 24, thereby being enlarged in size.<br>
The step 23a is arranged on the front side of the vehicle<br>
of the exhaust port 27 (see Fig. 1) . With this, when the<br>
motorcycle 10 is viewed from the front, the exhaust port 27<br>
is completely hidden by outer side cowl 23, specifically, the<br>
step 23a (see Fig. 2). In this manner, a negative pressure<br>
is produced near the exhaust port 27 by the running wind to<br>
easily exhaust the heated air outside the vehicle from the<br>
engine 30 and the radiator 40. Moreover, of the edge portion<br>
22f of the inner side cowl 22, a portion upward of the exhaust<br>
port 27 has a depression 22d formed therein, the depression<br>
22d being extended in the front and rear direction of the<br>
 <br>
vehicle. With this, a high-speed air flow passing through the<br>
depression 22d is positioned upward of the exhaust port 27,<br>
whereby the heated air exhausted from the exhaust port 27 is<br>
quickly transported rearward of the vehicle by the air flow.<br>
According to the motorcycle 10 described above, the portion<br>
of the outside opening 22b of the duct 22c formed on the inner<br>
side cowl 22 is covered by the outer side cowl 23, and the<br>
exposed portion is hidden by the outer side cowl 23 when the<br>
motorcycle 10 is viewed from the front. Thus, the negative<br>
pressure can be sufficiently produced around the exhaust port<br>
27 by the running wind, and hence the heated air can be<br>
effectively exhausted outside the vehicle. Moreover, the<br>
inner side cowl 22, on which the duct 22c extended in the vehicle<br>
width direction is formed, is fixed inside the outer side cowl<br>
23. Thus, the side cowl 29 can have sufficient strength as<br>
a whole.<br>
