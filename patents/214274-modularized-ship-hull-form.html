				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing modularized ship hull form<br>
for its production and to the production of ship hull form involving modularization of<br>
three modular zones of the ship hull involving the aft body, mid body and fore body. The<br>
invention is also directed to a system for use in separate modularization of the three<br>
zones based on the desired functional and geometric requirements and finally provide a<br>
composite form of the ship hull depending upon the end user requirements. The process<br>
of manufacture of the ship hull of the invention is directed to serve in large scale<br>
production of varieties of ship hull forms at reduced time span and at cost effective rates<br>
thereby serving better the requirements and demands of the ship building industry.<br>
Description of the known art<br>
Ships are generally custom-built. Each ship is developed as per the owner"s<br>
requirements independent of previous developed/designed hulls except in case of sister<br>
ships in which the same ship is repeatedly produced. Considering the varied uses and<br>
cost factors involved in the developments of such ships, it is not convenient to generate<br>
ship hulls as per the customer"s requirement readily and often the development of such<br>
ship hulls is found to be time consuming and cost extensive process.<br>
Additionally, as and when any ship is required to be developed involving alterations in<br>
form in view of the complexities involved, the conventional ship manufacturing processes<br>
are found to be not well equipped to generate such altered forms as per the end user"s<br>
requirements. Therefore, it is usual after the ship is developed the customer may not be<br>
satisfied and the builder may be required to rework on the existing module to make it<br>
somewhat satisfactory for the customer. However, it would be apparent from such<br>
conventional processes of ship manufacture that such processes are not streamlined<br>
and are usually attended on an ad-hoc basis involving lot of time and cost to develop a<br>
particular form of the ship. More importantly due to lack of direction in obtaining the<br>
modules of defined characteristics to suit the end users requirement, the conventional<br>
processes of manufacture often lead to products which do not have the desired<br>
uniformity or compatibility between the three modular zones of the<br>
ship i.e. the aft body, mid body and fore body. This again results in a ship hull,<br>
which may not achieve the desired functionality and geometric requirements for<br>
effective use.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the invention to provide for improvement in the in ship<br>
hull form development and its production and enable the manufacture of various<br>
forms of ship hull which would avoid the above discussed limitations and<br>
constraints of the conventional art of developing ship hull forms.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a process for modularization<br>
of ship hull to favour industrial production of varied modular forms of ship hull<br>
which would match the requirements of the end user by way of a more<br>
confirmatory and composite developmental process steps leading to ship hull<br>
forms meeting customer"s requirements and avoiding the conventional forms of<br>
reworking to meet customer"s satisfaction.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to the development of ship<br>
hull taking into account the complexities of the three dimensional structure and in<br>
particular the specific requisite of the aft body, fore body and mid body of a ship<br>
hull and provide process steps which could not only provide variations in the<br>
forms of the respective zones of the ship hull depending upon the varied end<br>
uses but would also provide for a compatible relation of the three zones to<br>
provide a continuous surface of the hull form improving its functional and<br>
geometric characteristics.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to providing a method of<br>
development of ship hull forms which can be industrially applied to generate<br>
varied forms of ship hull at cost effective rates meeting consumer requirements.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method for modularization of ship hull for its production comprising :<br>
providing a system of database concerning the usual technical and building<br>
specification for a number of such ships;<br>
identification of the desired specifications for such modular ships including their<br>
functional and other features ;<br>
analyzing the available database and generating the specifications for the aft<br>
region, fore region and mid body region for the range of identified ships;<br>
dividing the ship length into three distinct zones comprising a) aft body extending<br>
from aft till forward of engine room forward bulk head, b) fore body extending<br>
from fore end of the ship till aft of fore peak bulk head and c) mid body consisting<br>
of the middle portion between the aft body and fore body;<br>
identifying the functional requirements of the thus defined three zones comprising<br>
said aft body, mid body and fore body ;<br>
ascertaining the constructional parameters for the said three zones based on the<br>
available input database and the functional requirements of the three zones ;<br>
generating the modular design of the said three zones satisfying the separate<br>
functional requirement and the overall geometric constraints ; and<br>
merging the zones into a single continuous three dimensionally faired body to<br>
thereby obtain the modular ship.<br>
The above disclosed method of modularization of ship hull, involve conventional<br>
software packages to support the various database and input data, execute<br>
statistical analysis, economic analysis, technical calculation, surface modeling<br>
and CAD. The method effectively integrates the above to facilitate simple and<br>
cost-effective modularization of the ship hull.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method for modularization of ship hull comprising:<br>
providing database concerning the usual technical and building specification for a<br>
number of ships preferably having stored data concerning laws of flotation, cargo<br>
requirements of volume and weight, requirements on operating economics,<br>
requirements of building economics, technical constraints imposed by the ship<br>
building yard, statutory requirements and requirements of ship classification<br>
societies;<br>
identification of the desired specifications for the modular ship including its<br>
functional and other features such as the desired hydrodynamics, propulsion,<br>
steering and accommodation of the aft body, the cargo, cargo volume and<br>
production kindliness of the mid body and hydrodynamics, production kindliness<br>
of the fore body;<br>
analyzing the available database and generating the specifications for the aft<br>
region, fore region and mid body region for the range of identified ships;<br>
dividing the ship length into three distinct zones comprising a) aft body extending<br>
from aft till forward of engine room forward bulk head, b) fore body extending<br>
from fore end of the ship till aft of fore peak bulk head and c) mid body consisting<br>
of the middle portion between the aft body and fore body;<br>
identifying the functional requirements of the thus defined three zones comprising<br>
said aft body, mid body and fore body ;<br>
ascertaining the constructional parameters for the said three zones based on the<br>
available input database and the functional requirements of the three zones ;<br>
generating the modular design of the said three zones satisfying the separate<br>
functional requirement and the overall geometric constraints ; and<br>
merging the zones into a single continuous three dimensionally faired body to<br>
thereby obtain the modular ship.<br>
Importantly, in the above method of the invention the modularized design of the<br>
three zones should satisfy separate functional requirements which would meet<br>
overall geometric constraints as hereunder:<br>
a) The parallel mid body should be adapted to be changed (thereby changing<br>
length of ship) to suit the requirements of the product mix. The depth can be<br>
varied to a limited extent by change of the above water portion of the ship to<br>
suit the requirements of the product mix maintaining requisite freeboard.<br>
b) Block Coefficient and Longitudinal Centre of Buoyancy ; the three zones<br>
should be so designed that the final Cb and LCB confirm to the optimal values<br>
with regard to Froude number.<br>
c) Deck area : The overall deck area must be adequate with regard to cargo<br>
arrangements (e.g. container arrangement above deck).<br>
d) Merging of the Zones : The most stringent requirement of the modularization<br>
concept is merging of the zones shapes into a single continuous three -<br>
dimensionally faired body. This requires that slope and curvature must<br>
maintain continuity in the water line and buttock planes in the merged region:<br>
aft body and mid body, mid body and fore body.<br>
Also, the above steps of modularization in the process of invention is carried out<br>
by modeling the three regions so that slope and curvature continuity can be<br>
achieved across the merged lines ensuring geometric requirements such as main<br>
dimensions, deck area, Cb and LCB location and smooth merging of the three<br>
zones.<br>

specification for a number of such ships;<br>

means for identifying the functional requirements of the thus defined three zones<br>
comprising said aft body, mid body and fore body ;<br>

involve conventional software packages to support the various database and<br>
input data, execute statistical analysis, economic analysis, technical calculation,<br>
surface modeling and CAD. The system used should integrate the above to<br>
facilitate simple and cost-effective modularization of the ship hull.<br>

means for merging the zones into a single continuous three dimensionally faired<br>
body to thereby obtain the modular ship.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
To meet the above objectives of the invention a detailed study and analysis of the<br>
complexities involved in the manufacture of ship hull forms were studied. It was<br>
identified that the development of modular form of ship hull is basically subject to<br>
the following constrains:<br>
i. laws of flotation;<br>
ii. cargo requirements of volume and weight;<br>
iii. requirement of operating economics;<br>
iv. requirement of building economics;<br>
v. technical constraints generally imposed by the ship building yard;<br>
vi. statutory requirements of port state control authorities i.e. safety, stability,<br>
free board, maneuverability, noise, pollution etc.;<br>
vii. requirements of ship classification societies i.e. structural arrangements,<br>
standards, machinery and equipment,<br>
viii. Hydrodynamic design requirements of powering, flow characteristics, etc.<br>
To meet the above complex requirements of ship hull forms and possible variants<br>
thereof and to make the possible process of manufacturing of such ship hull<br>
forms industrially applicable and to have control over the manufacturing process<br>
to meet consumer demands and end user requirements keeping in view the<br>
above complexities, the complex three dimensional structure of the ship hull is<br>
categorized under the process of modularization of the invention into three<br>
longitudinal zones comprising the aft body (from aft and till forward of engine<br>
room forward bulkhead), fore body (from fore end of the ship till aft of fore peak<br>
bulk head) and mid body (middle portion between the aft body and the fore body).<br>
Lengthwise arrangement of the three selected zones is shown in accompanying<br>
Fig. 1<br>
The aft body is found to be the most complex portion of the ship having maximum<br>
content in terms of construction and assembly of equipment. It is also most<br>
demanding in terms of cost and time. Thus there exists a need for development<br>
of process of modularization/standardization of the aft body which could suit a<br>
range of product mix of ships in combination with different fore body and mid<br>
body whereby the cost and time of construction could be brought down.<br>
Importantly, such process of manufacture involving modularized/standardized aft<br>
body would enable standardization of machinery, equipment and production<br>
process of the aft body. The basic functions and requisites of the aft body for<br>
such purpose are identified as hereunder:<br>
a. hydrodynamics - good flow characteristics around the stern, propeller disc<br>
and rudder;<br>
b. propulsion - adequate internal volume to house a range of main machinery of<br>
the propulsion system subject to various requirements of the product mix;<br>
c. steering - proper aft body shape with constant position of aft perpendicular<br>
and stern aperture;<br>
d. accommodation - standardize accommodation matching with after body<br>
shape to serve the varying requirements of the product mix.<br>
It is also identified the mid body of the ship constitutes the biggest portion in<br>
terms of volume and length and is provided as the freight earning portion of the<br>
ship. It is structurally simpler than the other two zones of the ship but contains<br>
the maximum steelwork in terms of weight. The variations in this area are<br>
identified to include length, bilge radius (mid ship area) and prismatic co-efficient.<br>
It is also found that this mid body construction is subject to constraints of function<br>
and requirements such as;<br>
a. cargo - different internal arrangements for varying product mix such as<br>
containers, liquid cargo (POL), bulk cargo and general cargo etc;<br>
b. cargo volume - cargo volume can be adjusted to suit product mix by adjusting<br>
the following geometric characteristic in this region-<br>
i. length (change in parallel middle body length),<br>
ii. block co-efficient (by changing sectional area curve),<br>
c. production kindliness - this can be introduced into the product mix by keeping<br>
the same internal volume but varying the bilge radius and thereby altering the<br>
length of parallel middle body.<br>
It is further identified that the fore body of a ship is highly three dimensional,<br>
structurally complex and difficult to fabricate. Therefore, the process of<br>
modularization was directed to achieve a standardized fore body which could<br>
reduce production cost and time substantially. The fundamental requirements of<br>
the fore body module which required consideration were identified as follows:<br>
a. hydrodynamics - to suit the varying requirements of the product mix<br>
particularly with regard to design draught (container ship design draught is<br>
lower than that of a tanker) and ballast draught (found to be important for<br>
tankers and bulk carriers). Hydrodynamic designs of the bulb is also required<br>
such that it takes into account the range of speeds of the varying product mix;<br>
b. production kindliness - it is important the fore body shape is developed such<br>
that it can be produced easily and is able to house standardized anchoring<br>
and mooring equipment for the production mix.<br>
Keeping in view the above identified requisites for producing varied ship hull<br>
forms depending upon end user requirement the process of development of such<br>
ship hulls involving modularization in accordance with the present invention<br>
basically involves the following steps:<br>
1. identification of product mix required in terms of the dimensional and other<br>
requirements such as length, breadth, depth, draught, speed, block co-<br>
efficient and longitudinal centre of buoyancy.<br>
2. Identifying the required division based on such dimensional characteristics of<br>
the three sections comprising the aft body, mid body and fore body;<br>
3. selectively providing desired number of units of each of the three modular<br>
zones to satisfy the product mix requirements;<br>
4. selectively developing each of said modular zones keeping in view the<br>
functional and geometric requirements detailed above based on end user<br>
requirements/applications.<br>
It is found that by following the above process steps and modularizing the ship<br>
hull form and its utilization in the process of manufacture of ship hull one would<br>
provide for a more convenient and cost effective manufacture of varied forms of<br>
ship hulls.<br>
Importantly, it is found that by way of following the above process of<br>
modularization and integrating the same in the manufacture of ship hulls the<br>
various geometrical constraints of development of ship hull forms could be<br>
satisfied including :<br>
a. the parallel middle body can be adapted to suit the requirements of product<br>
mix. The depth can be varied to a limited extent by change of the above<br>
water portion of the ship to suit the requirements of product mix maintaining<br>
requisite freeboard;<br>
b. block co-efficient and longitudinal centre of buoyancy values are optimized<br>
with regard to Froude number by way of modularization of the three zones;<br>
c. the overall deck area can be maximized depending upon cargo<br>
arrangements/requirements; and<br>
d. effective merging of the three zones into a continuous three dimensional<br>
faired body. The slope and curvature selected to ensure the continuity in the<br>
water line and buttock planes in the merged regions of the three sections.<br>
The invention is explained in further detail by way of the following non-limiting<br>
example and the accompanying figures thereunder:<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 1A which is a block diagram<br>
illustrating the method of manufacture of modularized ship hull in accordance with<br>
the present invention. As represented in said figure such modularization of ship<br>
hull basically comprises of database (1) concerning the usual technical and<br>
building specification for such ship hull; identification (2) of the desired<br>
specifications for the modular ship including its functional and other features ;<br>
Analyzing (3) the available database and generating the specifications for the aft<br>
region, fore region and mid body region for the range of identified ship ; dividing<br>
(4) the ship length into three distinct zones comprising a) aft body extending from<br>
aft till forward of engine room forward bulk head, b) fore body extending from fore<br>
end of the ship till aft of fore peak bulk head and c) mid body consisting of the<br>
middle portion between the aft body and fore body; identifying (5) the functional<br>
requirements of the thus defined three zones comprising said aft body, mid body<br>
and fore body ; ascertaining (6) the constructional parameters for the said three<br>
zones based on the available input database and the functional requirements of<br>
the three zones ; generating (7) the modular design of the said three zones<br>
satisfying the separate functional requirement and the overall geometric<br>
constraints ; and merging (8) the zones into a single continuous three<br>
dimensionally faired body to thereby obtain the modular ship.<br>

illustrates by way of a block diagram and an embodiment of the system for use in<br>
the method of modularization of the ship hull in accordance with the present<br>
invention. As shown in said figure the system basically involves means for<br>
providing database (A) concerning the usual technical and building specification<br>
for such ship hull; means for identification (B) of the desired specifications for the<br>
modular ship including its functional and other features ; means for analyzing (C)<br>
the available database and generating the specifications for the aft region, fore<br>
region and mid body region for the range of identified ship ; means for dividing<br>
(D) the ship length into three distinct zones comprising a) aft body extending from<br>
aft till forward of engine room forward bulk head, b) fore body extending from fore<br>
end of the ship till aft of fore peak bulk head and c) mid body consisting of the<br>
middle portion between the aft body and fore body; means for identifying (E) the<br>
functional requirements of the thus defined three zones comprising said aft body,<br>
mid body and fore body ; means for ascertaining (F) the constructional<br>
parameters for the said three zones based on the available input database and<br>
the functional requirements of the three zones ; means for generating (G) the<br>
modular design of the said three zones satisfying the separate functional<br>
requirement and the overall geometric constraints ; and merging (H) the zones<br>
into a single continuous three dimensionally faired body to thereby obtain the<br>
modular ship.<br>
Example<br>
STEP 1: Using a conventional shipping market database covering current<br>
published literature and in-house economic analysis to generate technical<br>
specifications for identified product mix.<br>
The broad product mix identified was as follows :<br>
550-650 TEU feeder container vessels<br>
9000-12000 t DWT product tankers for short sea voyages<br>
9000-12000 DWT bulk carriers and multipurpose cargo carriers<br>
Identifying specific vessel types suitable for production based on available<br>
resoucees:<br>
• 550 TEU Feeder Container vessel for 14.0 knots to 15.5 knots design speed<br>
• 600 TEU Feeder Container vessel for 14.0 knots to 15.5 knots design speed<br>
• 650 TEU Feeder Container vessel for 14.0 knots to 15.5 knots design speed<br>
• 9000 t DWT Product Tankers/Bulk Cariers/Multipurpose Cargo Carriers for<br>
13.5 knots to 14.5 knots design speed<br>
• 10500 t DWT Product Tankers/Bulk Cariers/Multipurpose Cargo Carriers for<br>
13.5 knots to 14.5 knots design speed<br>
• 12000 t DWT Product Tankers/Bulk Cariers/Multipurpose Cargo Carriers for<br>
13.5 knots to 14.5 knots design speed<br>
STEP 2: Identification of desired features of the ship based on modular concept<br>
and by utilizing the client requirement database based on the available<br>
resources of shipbuilding and the feeder container and POL service trade<br>
patterns for defined sea routes .<br>
The variation in the following main dimensions and ship particulars were<br>
determined :<br>
• Length to vary between 113m and 127m<br>
• Breadth not to exceed : 19m<br>
• Depth to vary between 10.3m and 11 m<br>
• Draught - fully loaded: 6.6m for feeder container vessel and 7.8m for the<br>
other vessels<br>
• Draught ballast: No special requirement for container vessel, 5.5m aft and<br>
4.0m forward for other vessels<br>
• Block coefficient to vary between 0.68 and 0.72<br>
STEP 3: Identification of the functional specification of the aft region, mid body<br>
region andfore region by utilising the technical information and preliminary design<br>
calculations for the desired range of ships.<br>
The following manufacturing specifications were identified for the modular region<br>
i.e. aft region, midbody region and fore region .<br>
The vessel with length 113 m should have the smallest length of parallel middle<br>
body.<br>
The vessel length should be changed by steps of 7m to generate ships of length<br>
120 and 127m.<br>
This length variation to be obtained only by changing the parallel middle body.<br>
The depth variation between 10.3 m to 11.0 m is to be obtained by extending the<br>
above water portion of the hull only without affecting hydrodynamic performance<br>
of the ship.<br>
For an optimum hydrodynamic performance of the entire range of products, it<br>
was found that the LCB should vary between 0 m and 1 m forward of midship.<br>
The fore end should be suitable for two draught operations; (1) suitable for<br>
container ships and (2) suitable for tankers, bulkers and multipurpose vessels.<br>
The stern required to be standardized for the given range of vessels.<br>
STEP 4 : The ship length for the entire product mix was divided into three<br>
distinct modular regions.<br>
Fig. 1 shows such selective division of ships into three regions, which are as<br>
follows:<br>
• Aft body was selected from aft end till forward bulkhead of aft engine room<br>
bulkhead.<br>
• Mid body was selected from the fore end of the aft body till the fore peak<br>
bulkhead<br>
• Fore body was selected from fore peak bulkhead till fore end.<br>
STEP 5 : The functional requirements of the three module regions of the ship<br>
hulls were identified by utilizing the conventional information data base and naval<br>
architectural calculation software.<br>
The following desired functional requirements were identified for the three<br>
separate regions.<br>
Aft region: (1) is to be suitable for providing a uniform distribution of wake in the<br>
propeller disc region for all vessels (2) is to have adequate volume to provide<br>
propulsion and auxiliary machinery for all vessels (3) is to have adequate area in<br>
the upper deck region to provide standardized accommodation.<br>
Midbody region: (1) to provide adequate volume based on the payload<br>
requirement of all vessels (2) the fore and aft ends of the midbody region should<br>
merge with the fore region and aft region respectively in such a manner that the<br>
fore shoulder and aft shoulder of the ship hull is smooth and does not create<br>
adverse wave making effects (3) the distribution of the area along the length of<br>
this region is to be such that the required LCB of the vessel is attained.<br>
Fore body: the functional requirement of the fore body is primarily hydrodynamic<br>
which is (1) to have a bulbous bow to operate at 6.6 m draught for the container<br>
vessels and (2) to have a bulbous bow to operate at a full load draught of 7.8 m<br>
and a ballast draught 5.5m aft and 4.0 m forward for all other vessels.<br>
STEP 6 : Identifying the possible constructional parameters of the three modular<br>
regions meeting the producibility requirements and consumers requirements::<br>
Aft region : (1) one stern shape was identified as a standard stern for all products<br>
mentioned above (2) two standard accommodation suiting the stern have been<br>
designed for (a) the container ship having a 6-tire accommodation and (b) a 5-tier<br>
accommodation for all other vessels.<br>
Midbody region: (1) two midbodies with bilge radius 2.2 m and 3.5 m were<br>
identified during different parallel middle bodies which can be selected based on<br>
the producibility requirements.<br>
Fore body region: two fore body shapes are identified (a) one for container<br>
vessel and (b) another for all other vessels. The desired fore body shape was<br>
selected taking into account the manufacturing capabilities.<br>
STEP 7 : Providing various shapes of the three regions utilizing standard CAD-<br>
software packages for the three separate regions. The following figures<br>
demonstrate the producible shapes of three regions identified.<br>
• Fore body F1 (fig 2) with bulbous bow - corresponding to container ship<br>
having a design draught of 6.6m for entire speed range of 14 to 15.5 knots<br>
• Fore body F2 (fig 3) with bulbous bow - corresponding to bulk<br>
carrier/tanker/multipurpose ship for entire speed range of 13 to 14.5 knots<br>
• Stern S (fig 4) for entire product mix given above<br>
• Mid body M11 (fig 5), M12 (fig 6) and M13 (fig 7) corresponding to 3 lengths<br>
with 2.2m bilge radius corresponding to the overall Cb of 0.71.<br>
• Mid body M21 (fig 8), M22 (fig 9) and M23 (fig 10) corresponding to 3<br>
lengths with 3.5m bilge radius giving a large parallel middle body<br>
corresponding to the overall CB of 0.71<br>
• M3 corresponding to a length of 120m with 2.2m bilge radius and minimum<br>
parallel middle body giving an overall Cb of 0.68 for a speed of 16.0 knots<br>
STEP 8 : Selectively merging the three zones to form a selective number of<br>
continuous ship hulls with detailed specifications for manufacture by<br>
conventional surface fairing and modeling software.<br>
The thus generated selective specifications of the ship hull involving the above<br>
method of modularization in accordance with the invention can be<br>
advantageously used to manufacture cost-effectively user specific ship hull using<br>
conventionally available gadgets and by following known methods.<br>
The hull shapes were found to be successful and as further illustrated by<br>
integration of modules Stern S, Fore bodies F1 and F2, superstructure SS5 and<br>
SS6 (figs 11 &amp; 12) and mid bodies M11, M12, M13, M21, M22, M23 to generate<br>
ships as per the product mix. Thirteen (13) different ship types developed using<br>
the modularization steps and are 12 of these are shown in figures 13 to 24.<br>
It is thus demonstrated by way of the above exemplary illustrations that the step<br>
of modularization in the manufacture of ship hull forms would enable generating<br>
varied form of ship hull at cost effective rates and involving less time and<br>
complexities than that of the present art of manufacture of such ship hulls.<br>
Importantly, the invention would provide for standardization in manufacture of<br>
ship hull forms of varied specifications depending upon the end users<br>
requirements at an industrial level thereby avoiding of non-uniform modules<br>
and/or required reworking on modules to meet consumer demands/specifications.<br>
