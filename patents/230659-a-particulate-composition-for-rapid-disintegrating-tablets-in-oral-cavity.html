Besides the above, there have been disclosed a method for the production of oral dissolving tablets wherein saccharides such as xylitol, a pharmacologically active ingredient and water are mixed and made into tablets (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 5(1993)-271054), an orally dissolving compression-molded product comprising granulates prepared by a fluidized-bed granulation of saccharides having a low molding property together with saccharides having a high molding property as binders (WO 95/20380), a rapid disintegrating solid preparation containing an active ingredient, a saccharide having an average particle diameter of 5 μm to 90 μm, a saccharide having an average particle diameter of 90 μm to 500 μm, a disintegrating agent and cellulose (WO 00/78292), a rapid disintegrating solid preparation prepared by spray-drying one sugar alcohol and a disintegrating agent, followed by dry tabletting (WO 02/69934), etc.<br>

The term "rapid disintegrating tablet in oral cavity" used herein means a tablet which is able to be disintegrated in oral cavity rapidly, for example, within 40 seconds, preferably within 30 seconds, more preferably within 25 seconds and, still more preferably, within 20 seconds.   The disintegration time in oral cavity used herein is the time which is measured by the measuring method mentioned in the Examples shown below.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
With regard to saccharides (component (a)) comprised in the composition of the present invention, a mixture of mannitol and xylitol is used.   This mixture forms complex particles.   These saccharides are used in an amount of 40 to 90 parts by weight, preferably 50 to 80 parts by weight, more preferably 60 to 78 part by weight and, still more preferably, 62 to 78 parts by weight based on the total weight of the composition. [0009]<br>
Ratio by weight of mannitol to xylitol as saccharides is preferably such that mannitol : xylitol = (98 to 67) : (2 to 33), more preferably mannitol : xylitol = (98 to 87) : (2 to 13), still more<br><br>
preferably mannitol: xylitol = (97 to 87 : (3 to 13) and furthermore<br>
preferably mannitol: xylitol = (96 to 89) : (4 to 11).<br>
[0010]<br>
With regard to an average particle diameter of the saccharide used in the present invention, it is 500 μm or smaller, preferably 5 to 300 μm and, more preferably, 5 to 200 μm in order to preventing the roughness in oral cavity.   However, since xylitol is always dissolved during the manufacture, one having any particle diameter may be used.   Any mannitol and xylitol may be used so far as they are the substances commercially available. [0011]<br>
Mannitol is usually used for obtaining powdery compositions having low hygroscopicity and high fluidity.    However, its molding property is poor and its solubility is low as well and, therefore, when it is used in a composition for rapid disintegrating tablets, a balance between the disintegration time in oral cavity and the hardness of the resulting tablets has not been satisfactory. [0012]<br>
However, the present inventors have found that, when mannitol is used in a specific ratio with xylitol, greatly shortened disintegration time in oral cavity, a good hardness and an excellent tablet-forming property may be obtained. [0013]<br>
The inorganic excipient (component (b)) comprised in the composition of the present invention is used 1 to 30 part(s),by weight,<br><br>
preferably 2 to 20 parts by weight, more preferably 2 to 15 parts by weight, further preferably 2 to 9 parts by weight and, most preferably, 3 to 8 parts by weight based on the total weight of the composition; its average particle diameter is 0.1 to 100 μm, preferably, 1 to 60 μm and, more preferably, 1 to 40 μm. [0014]<br>
The inorganic excipient preferably has an average pore diameter of 100 nm or smaller and is preferred to be a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic compound containing any of aluminum, magnesium and calcium.   It is preferably selected from, for example, magnesium aluminometasilicate, magnesium aluminosilicate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, hydrotalcite, synthetic aluminum silicate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, talc, magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide, alumina-magnesium hydroxide, dry aluminum hydroxide gel, magnesium carbonate and calcium silicate; any of them may be used solely or in a mixture of two or more thereof.    It is more preferably selected from magnesium aluminometasilicate, magnesium aluminosilicate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, hydrotalcite, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, talc and dry aluminum hydroxide gel.    It is still more preferably selected from magnesium aluminometasilicate, hydrotalcite, calcium hydrogen phosphate and calcium carbonate. [0015]<br>
In the composition of the present invention, the disintegrating agent (component (c)) in the composition of the present invention is<br><br>
used 5 to 40 parts by weight, preferably 10 to 36 parts by weight, more preferably 16 to 35 parts by weight and, still more preferably, 18 to 34 parts by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Average particle diameter of the disintegrating agent is 0.1 to 100 fim, preferably 1 to 60μm and, more preferably, 1 to 40μm. [0016]<br>
The disintegrating agent is preferably selected from crospovidone, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and crystalline cellulose and, although any of them may be used solely, it is preferred to use a mixture of two or more thereof. The disintegrating agent is preferably selected from crospovidone and crystalline cellulose and, although any of them may be used solely, it is preferred to use a mixture of both. [0017]<br>
When crospovidone and crystalline cellulose are used as the disintegrating agent, crospovidone is contained, based on the total weight of the composition, preferably 5 to 15 parts by weight, more preferably 5 to 14 parts by weight and, still more preferably, 6 to 13 parts by weight, while crystalline cellulose is contained, based on the total weight of the composition, preferably 8 to 22 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 22 parts by weight and, still more preferably, 12 to 21 parts by weight. [0018]<br>
The composition of the present invention has such a structure that the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are<br><br>
homogeneously dispersed in complex particles comprising mannitol and xylitol.   As a result of making the composition into such a structure, the composition can have an improved disintegrating property and an excellent molding property as well. [0019]<br>
The complex particles comprising mannitol and xylitol in the above composition include those which form a solid dispersion.   The fact that the complex particles form a solid dispersion can be confirmed by the phenomenon that an endothermic peak of saccharides measured by a differential scanning colorimeter is shifted to a low temperature side.   The complex particles are in such a state that xylitol molecule is substituted for mannitol molecule in a crystalline structure of mannitol or that xylitol molecule comes into pores of crystalline structure of mannitol causing a strain in the crystalline structure of mannitol whereupon a state of higher energy is resulted than normal crystals of mannitol only.    Such a crystal has been known as a solid dispersion and, since it is more difficult to exist as solid than a pure substance, a phenomenon of depression of freezing point is resulted. [0020]<br>
As a result of making mannitol into such a state of high energy, the composition of the present invention has now a high molding property, a rapid disintegrating property and a tablet hardness suitable as a composition for rapid disintegrating tablets in oral cavity even with mannitol which is usually poor in terms of a molding<br><br>
property, a rapid disintegrating property and a tablet hardness to be used as a composition for rapid disintegrating tablets in oral cavity. [0021]<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that shift of the endothermic peak of the saccharides to the low temperature side in the composition of the present invention is 0.5 to 19°C, more preferably 1 to 9°C or, still more preferably, 1 to 8°C; the composition as such has a good disintegration in oral cavity and a molding property upon tabletting.    For the composition of the present invention, shift of the endothermic peak of the saccharides to a low temperature side is 0.5 to 19°C when the ratio by weight of mannitol to xylitol is (98 to 67):(2 to 33), 1 to 9°C when the ratio by weight of mannitol to xylitol is (97 to 87): (3 to 13) and 1 to 8°C when the ratio by weight of mannitol to xylitol is (96 to 89):(4to 11). [0022]<br>
The composition of the present invention can be obtained as particles where the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are homogeneously dispersed and that is a state in which the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are not aggregated but are dispersed each other, and such a state is the optimum structure to introduce small amount of moisture in oral cavity into the tablet in a more abundant and more rapid manner.   The state where the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are dispersed can be observed under a scanning electron microscope.   As a result of such measurement by the scanning electron microscope, each of the<br><br>
disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient is dispersed in average particle diameter of 0.5 to 50 μm, preferably in 1 to 40 pm and, more preferably, in 2 to 30 μm.   It is believed that water-introducible pores of the specific inorganic excipient introduce small amount of water into the tablet and the water effectively act on the disintegrating agent which is also dispersed, thus a favorable rapid disintegration in oral cavity is obtained. [0023]<br>
The composition of the present invention is characterized that a compression property on a common rotary tablet machine is good in spite of a high compounding rate of saccharides.   The fact that the compression property is good is shown by means of a capping rate which is measured by a tabletting tester.   The capping rate of the present composition is 0.85 to 1.00 or, preferably, 0.90 to 1.00.   The capping rate is able to be measured by tabletting 400 to 500 mg of the composition using a tabletting tester (SK-02 manufactured by Sankyo Pio-Tech Co., Ltd.) under the conditions of 500 to 1,000 kg/cm2 of compressing pressure using a punch of 11.3 mm. [0024]<br>
With regard to common troubles upon tabletting a composition containing saccharides, it has been also known that troubles of not only capping but also sticking, die friction (binding), etc, are apt to happen.    However, even when the present composition is subjected to a high-speed compression (50 to 60 rpm) using a rotary tablet machine, there is generated no troubles in tabletting such as capping,<br><br>
sticking and die friction. [0025]<br>
Besides the saccharides, the inorganic excipient and the disintegrating agent, the composition of the present invention may be compounded with a pharmacologically active ingredient and/or a component which does not deteriorate the disintegrating property.<br>
The pharmacologically active ingredient is able to be compounded in an amount of 0.01 to 100 part(s) by weight, preferably 0.01 to 67 part(s) by weight or, more preferably, 0.01 to 60 part(s) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the saccharides, the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient.<br>
The composition of the present invention is able to be produced by compounding the pharmacologically active ingredient with the saccharides, the inorganic excipient and the disintegrating agent.<br>
The component which does not deteriorate the disintegrating property is able to be compounded in an amount of 0.01 to 1000 part(s) by weight or, preferably, in 0.1 to 500 part(s) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the saccharides, the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient. [0026]<br>
The composition of the present invention is able to be produced by compounding the component which does not deteriorate the disintegrating property with the saccharides, the inorganic excipient and the disintegrating agent.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be prepared by<br><br>
any manufacturing method so long as a desired physical property can be achieved by the component ratio of the composition of the present invention although, preferably, it is prepared by a spray-drying method.<br>
The particles having a characteristic structure of the present invention where the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are homogeneously dispersed in a complex particle formed from mannitol and xylitol can be easily prepared by means of the spray-drying method. [0027]<br>
The composition of the present invention is able to be produced by spray-drying an aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion containing the components (a) to (c) according to a common method. More specifically, it is able to be produced in such a manner that mannitol and xylitol are dissolved or dispersed in advance in an aqueous medium, the disintegrating agent and the inorganic excipient are homogeneously dispersed therein and the resulting dispersion is spray-dried.   The expression reading "mannitol and xylitol are dissolved or dispersed in advance in an aqueous medium" means the following.   Thus, it is sufficient that at least a part of mannitol and at least a part of xylitol are dissolved in the aqueous medium and that remaining parts of mannitol and xylitol may be either dissolved or dispersed.    For the purpose that mannitol and xylitol form a solid dispersion, it is preferred that a part of mannitol and all of xylitol are dissolved therein.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
With regard to the above-mentioned aqueous medium, any medium may be used so far as it has no affects on the physical property of the composition and which is pharmaceutically acceptable, examples thereof being water, ethanol and methanol.<br>
To the dispersion, a pharmacologically active ingredient may be optionally added and a component which does not deteriorate the disintegrating property may be optionally added.   The aqueous dispersion may be prepared by a known method and, although common methods such as stirring method, colloid mill method, high-pressure homogenizer method and ultrasonic wave irradiation method may be exemplified, a method in which the particles are highly dispersed in an aqueous dispersion is preferred.   It is particularly preferred that xylitol is completely dissolved, all or a part of mannitol is dissolved and water-insoluble substances, e.g. crospovidone, crystalline cellulose and inorganic excipient are disintegrated in a solution whereupon the dispersion having a high dispersing property is prepared.   With regard to a solid concentration of the dispersion, it may be within a range by which spray-drying is able to be conducted; and it is usually 10 to 50% by weight or, preferably, 25 to 45% by weight. [0029]<br>
There is no particular limitation for the condition of spray-drying.    However, with regard to a spray-dryer, it is preferred to use a spray-dryer of a disk type or a nozzle type.   With regard to the<br><br>
temperature for spray-drying, it is preferred that the inlet temperature is about 120 to 220°C and the outlet temperature is about 80 to 130°C. With regard to the solid concentration of the aqueous dispersion upon spray-drying, it may be within a range by which the spray-drying is able to be conducted and it is usually 10 to 50% by weight and, preferably, it is 25 to 45% by weight. [0030]<br>
Average particle diameter of the composition of the present invention prepared as such can be appropriately adjusted depending upon concentration of the aqueous solution or aqueous dispersion, spray-drying method, drying condition, etc. and, when it is 1 to 500 |xm, preferably 5 to 300 μm, more preferably 10 to 200 ]im or, still more preferably, 30 to 200 μm, a rough feeling in oral cavity can be prevented whereby that is preferred. [0031]<br>
A static specific volume of the above composition is preferably about 1.5 to 4.0 g/ml, more preferably about 1.5 to 3.5 g/ml and, still more preferably, about 1.5 to 2.5 g/ml.   Due to such a static specific volume, it is easy to fill the composition in a die upon tabletting and, therefore, a step for manufacturing of the tablets proceeds smoothly and, in addition, tablets are able to be uniformly compressed showing an excellent tabletting property.   The static specific volume can be measured by a standard method. [0032]<br>
Repose angle of the composition is 20 to 45° and, preferably 27<br><br>
to 40°.    Because the composition has such a repose angle, it shows an excellent fluidity and shows an excellent tabletting property in the manufacturing process.   The repose angle is able to be measured according to a standard method by using a powder tester (manufactured by Hosokawamicron Corp.). [0033]<br>

Evaluation of each tablet prepared in the Examples was carried out according to the following methods. [0051] Disintegration time in oral cavity<br>
The time from when tablets (six tablets) were placed in oral cavity of 3 to 8 panelists until they were completely disintegrated was measured and its mean value was adopted as a disintegration time in oral cavity. [0052] Hardness of tablets<br><br>
Measurement was conducted using a Monsanto hardness meter (manufactured by Kayagaki Irika Kogyo). [0053] Troubles upon tabletting<br>
It was observed whether there are adhered matters to upper and lower punches of a tablet machine (sticking, capping and die friction) to evaluate the tabletting troubles. [0054] Example 1<br>
Xylitol (50 g) was completely dissolved in 1500 mL of water, 650 g of mannitol was then added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature at 200 to 300 rpm for 60 minutes using a wet dispersing device (Mycolloider type M; manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) to give a dispersion in which mannitol was homogeneously dispersed.    To the dispersion were added 80 g of crospovidone, 150 g of crystalline cellulose and 70 g of magnesium aluminometasilicate (Neusilin UFL2; manufactured by Fuji Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) and, after the mixture was homogeneously dispersed, it was spray-dried using a spray-dryer (type L-8; manufactured by Okawahara Kakohki Co., Ltd.) to give a composition (Example 1-4),<br>

[0084] Example 11<br>
The composition shown as 1-4 in Table 1 prepared in Example 1 and the composition shown as 5-4 in Table 5 prepared in Example 5 were subjected to measurement of capping rate upon compression molding using a tabletting tester (SK-2; manufactured by Sankyo<br><br>

Example 12<br>
Xylitol (50 g) was completely dissolved in 1500 mL of water, 650 g of mannitol was then added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature at 200 to 300 rpm for 60 minutes using a wet dispersing device (Mycolloider type M; manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) to give a dispersion in which mannitol was homogeneously dispersed.   To the dispersion were added 80 g of crospovidone, 150 g of crystalline cellulose and 70 g of magnesium aluminometasilicate and, after the mixture was homogeneously dispersed, it was spray-dried using a spray-dryer (type L-8; manufactured by Okawahara Kakohki Co., Ltd.) with an inlet temperature of 150°C and an outlet temperature of 100°C to give white granules 1. [0087]<br>

Xylitol (50 g) was completely dissolved in 1500 mL of water, 650 g of mannitol was then added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature at 200 to 300 rpm for 60 minutes using a wet dispersing device (Mycolloider type M; manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) to give a dispersion in which mannitol was homogeneously dispersed.   To the dispersion were added 80 g of crospovidone, 180 g of crystalline cellulose and 40 g of calcium hydrogen phosphate and, after the mixture was homogeneously dispersed, it was spray-dried using a spray-dryer (type L-8; manufactured by Okawahara Kakohki, Co., Ltd.) where an inlet temperature was 150°C and an outlet temperature was 100°C to give white granules 2.   Fig. 9 shows a picture of the granules 2 under a scanning electron microscope (manufactured by Keyence Corp.).   It is noted from Fig. 9 that particles of about 2μm and particles of about 5 μm are present, and they are homogeneously dispersed without aggregation on the surface of the composition of the invention. [0091]<br>
The resulting granules 2, L-ascorbic acid and magnesium stearate were mixed in an amount shown in Table 14 and tabletted using a rotary tablet machine (with a punch of 8 mm diameter where corners were flat) to prepare tablets each weighing 200 mg and having a tablet hardness of 3.5 kg.    Disintegration time in oral cavity of the resulting tablet and the existence of the tabletting troubles are shown in Table 14.<br><br><br><br>
added thereto and the mixture was tabletted using a rotary tablet machine to give tablets each weighing 200 mg and having a diameter of 8 mm.    Granules prepared by the spray-drying were very bulky and weights of the resulting tablets were significantly varied and, therefore, velocity of the rotary tablet machine was lowered and tabletting pressure was set to 100 kg/cm2 and 200 kg/cm2 to obtain the tablets. Disintegration test in oral cavity was conducted for the resulting tablets.   The result is shown in Table 17.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0098] Although the tablets which are prepared by using the composition for the rapid disintegrating tablets in oral cavity according to the present invention have higher hardness than the conventional rapid disintegrating tablets, they still have an advantage that disintegration time in oral cavity can be significantly shortened. Accordingly, the rapid disintegrating tablets in oral cavity according to<br><br>
