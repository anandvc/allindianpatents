				<td>The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br><br><br>
TRIAZOLYL AMINOPYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS<br><br>
Plk1 belongs to a small family of protein kinases characterized by a phosphoserine/threonine binding domain known as the polo box domain.  Plk1 plays a central role in the regulation of the cell cycle.  Among other functions, Plk1 is thought to regulate initiation, progression, and exit from mitosis, the stage when cancer cells divide.  Consequently, blocking Plk1 in cancer cells prevents their division or mitosis.  <br>
Potent anticancer agents have been identified that interfere with mitosis such as the vinca alkaloids (NAVELBINE®), taxoids (TAXOTERE®) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (ADRIAMYCIN®).  VELCADE® is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits the 26S proteosome.  However, these drugs cause considerable side effects upon normal, non-dividing cells.  Plk inhibitors specifically target dividing cells and may be able to avoid the undesirable toxicities.  <br>
Inhibitors of Plk1 are known in the art.  See for example, WO 06/066172.  Additionally, WO 06/021548 discloses certain dihydropteridinone analogs (e.g., BI-2536) as inhibitors of Plk1.  Currently, BI-2536 is in phase II clinical trials but has high clearance (CL &gt;1000 mL/min) and is dose limited by myelosupression in man.  There is still a need for further compounds that inhibit Plk1 which possess improved potency or pharmacokinetic properties.  <br>
The present invention provides novel triazolyl aminopyrimidine compounds believed to have clinical use for treatment of cancer through inhibiting Plk1.  Certain of these compounds are believed to have improved potency over compounds disclosed in WO 06/066172.  Additionally, certain of the compounds of the present invention are believed to have improved pharmacokinetic properties, for example, clearance, over BI-2536.  Further, due to the oral bioavailability of the compounds of the present invention that were tested, it is believed that certain of these compounds could be dosed orally.    <br><br>

The schemes together with the preparations and examples illustrate the synthesis of compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
Compound 5 in Scheme I is prepared by a palladium (0) coupling reaction between either starting material 1 with 2, or starting material 3 with 4.  A suitable palladium catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) or [1,1’-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) complex with DCM (1:1) [Pd(dppf)Cl2].  Pd(dppf)Cl2 is used in the presence of a base, such as sodium or potassium carbonate.  The reactions are carried out in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, and water, generally, at temperatures of from about 100 ºC to 150 ºC using an oil bath or a microwave reactor.  <br><br>
	Compound 5 is lithiated with lithium diisopropylamide in THF and triisopropylborate in situ forming a benzo[b]thiophene boronate species followed by a palladium (0) coupling reaction with a 2,4-dichloropyrimidine (Compound 6) giving Compound 7.  The boronate is generally formed at a low temperature, such as -78 oC.  The coupling reaction is followed immediately with conditions as described above for preparing Compound 5.  <br>
Compounds of the present invention are then prepared via a nucleophilic displacement reaction where Compound 7 is reacted with Compound 8.  Such reactions are carried out in a solvent, such as, n-butanol, dioxane, and N-methylpyrolidin-2-one (NMP).  The reactions are carried out at temperatures of from about 120 ºC to 150 ºC using an oil bath or a microwave reactor.  About 2 equivalents of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-1-ethanamine (Compound 8) are used.  Amine bases, such as triethyl amine and diisopropylethyl amine are used as acid scavengers.<br><br>
Scheme II<br>
Alternately, compounds of the present invention can be prepared by the Suzuki reaction between starting materials 2 and 9 or 4 and 10 with conditions described above.<br><br>
Since two coupling reactions are employed in the synthesis of compounds of the present invention, starting materials 9 and 10 of Scheme II represent a reverse coupling order by comparison with Scheme I. <br><br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all of the substituents in the compounds of the present invention will tolerate certain reaction conditions employed to synthesize the compounds.  These moieties may be introduced at a convenient point in the synthesis, or may be protected and then deprotected as necessary or desired.  The skilled artisan will appreciate that protecting groups may be introduced or removed at any convenient point in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.  Methods for introducing and removing nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups are well known in the art; see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, Chapter 7 (1999). Some of the examples of the present invention are prepared from other examples of the present invention.  Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in many circumstances, the order in which the moieties are introduced is not critical.  The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of the present invention can be dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties. <br>
Some the compounds of the present invention contain asymmetric centers.  In these instances, the enantiomers as well as the racemate are contemplated in the present invention.  ChemDraw ® version 10.0 was used in generating Example names.<br><br>

2-Benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane<br>
Combine 7-bromo-benzo[b]thiophene (426 mg, 2 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (756 mg, 3 mmol), Pd(dppf)Cl2 (81 mg, 0.1 mmol), and potassium acetate (294 mg, 3 mmol) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (10 mL) in a flask.  Bubble nitrogen through the mixture for 5 min.  Seal the flask and put it into an oil bath and heat to 100 °C for 4 hours (h).  Dilute the mixture with chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (3/1).  Wash the solution with saturated aqueous sodium chloride.  Dry over sodium sulfate.  Concentrate the solution in vacuo to a dark residue.  Purify by column chromatography (hexane? 20 % ethyl acetate in hexane) to afford the title compound as a colorless solid (342 mg, 66 %).  MS (ES) m/z 261 [M+1]+.<br><br>
Preparation 2<br>
Benzo[b]thiophene-7-boronic acid<br>
Combine 7-bromobenzo[b]thiophene (300 g, 1.41 mmol) and tri-isopropylborate (403.6 g, 2.15 mmol) in anhydrous THF (4 L) in a 12-L Morton flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and cool under nitrogen in a dry-ice/acetone bath to -70 oC.  Add n-butyl lithium (1.6 M in hexane, 714 g, 1.68 mmol) dropwise at such a rate as to keep the internal temperature less than -67.5 oC.  After the addition is complete allow the reaction mixture to stir at this temperature for 1 h.  Remove the cooling bath and slowly add 4 L of water, which causes the temperature to rise to about -5 oC.  Next, add concentrated HCl (75 mL) until the pH of the solution is about pH = 2.  Allow the slurry to stir for 1 h.  Add sufficient 5 N aqueous NaOH to adjust the pH of the mixture to about pH = 12 and transfer to a 22-L bottom-drop funnel.  Separate and save the lower aqueous layer.  Dilute the upper organic layer with 4 L of methyl-tert-butyl ether and extract with 1 L of 5 N aqueous NaOH.  Separate the aqueous layer, combine with the previous aqueous extract, and place back in the separatory funnel.  Wash the aqueous layer with additional methyl-tert-butyl ether (4 L).  Again, separate the aqueous layer and transfer to a 12-L, 3-neck round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer.  Cool the solution to +5 oC with an ice-water bath.  Add concentrated HCl slowly until the pH of the solution is about pH = 2.  Stir the mixture for 30 minutes (min) and then filter off the resulting solid.  Rinse the solid on the funnel twice with 2 L of       water       and       allow       to       air-dry       for       30       min.        Place       the <br><br><br>
solid in a vacuum oven at 50 oC and dry under vacuum overnight.  Slurry the dried solid with 2 L of n-heptane for 30 min to remove the yellow color.  Again, filter the solid, air-dry for 30 min, and then vacuum-dry at 40 oC overnight to afford the title compound (188.8 g, 75 %) as a white solid.  1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) ? 7.86 (d, J = 8 Hz, 1H), 7.49-7.57 (m, 2H), 7.30-7.39 (m, 2H).<br>

Plk1 has been shown to be over expressed in many human tumors, such as non-small cell lung, oropharyngeal, esophageal, gastric, melanoma, breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, glioblastoma, papillary, pancreatic, prostate, hepatoblastoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancers.  Furthermore, Plk1 expression has prognostic significance in non-small cell lung, oropharyngeal, esophageal, melanoma, colorectal, hepatoblastoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancers [Strebhardt, K. and A. Ullrich. Nature Reviews Cancer 6(4): 321-30 (2006)].  Plk1 phosphorylated substrates regulate progression of mitosis by coordinating centrosome maturation, entry into mitosis, sister chromatid separation and cytokinesis [Eckerdt F. Strebhardt K. Cancer Research. 66(14):6895-8, 2006; Strebhardt and Ullrich 2006; van de Weerdt, B. C. and R. H. Medema.  Cell Cycle 5(8): 853-64 (2006)].  Inhibiting Plk1 function using antibody injection, expression of a dominant negative Plk1, and antisense mRNA reduction produces monopole spindles and anaphase arrest leading to mitotic cell death in tumor cell lines but reversible G2 arrest in normal non-transformed primary cell lines.<br>
Additionally, it has been reported that Plk may be useful in the treatment of rhabdoid tumors, (Morozov A., et al., Clinical Cancer Research. 13(16):4721-30, (Aug 15, 2007).<br>
BI-2536 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models using HCT116, A549 and NCIH460 murine xenografts (Baum, A., P. Garin-Chesa, et al.

The results of the following assays demonstrate evidence that the compounds of the present invention are useful as anticancer agents.  Certain of the example compounds described herein are racemic mixtures.  These compounds are tested as racemic mixtures and/or as individual enantiomers.  At least one enantiomer or the racemate met the assay criterion below.<br>
Expression and purification of Plk1.<br>
Human Plk1 cDNA may be directly linked at one of its termini with a polynucleotide sequence expressing a His6 tag, such as the C-terminal FLAG-His6 tag, and inserted into an appropriate expression vector, such as a pFastBac™ vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into an appropriate system, such as baculovirus similar to what has been reported by Yue-Wei Qian, et al., Science, 282, 1701 (1998) for xPlk1.  If a viral expression system is used, then the virus (e.g., baculovirus bearing a Plk1-Flag-His6 tag polynucleotide construct) is infected into a culture of a suitable host cell, such as Sf9 cells.  When sufficient amounts of the Plk1-Flag-His6 tag fusion protein have been expressed, for example, at about 46 hours after infection, the culture should be treated with okadaic acid (0.1 µM) for a sufficient period of time (e.g., 3 hours).  The Plk1-Flag-His6 tag fusion is purified from cell pellets using a metal affinity resin, such as TALON™ using methods well known in the art.  Purified Plk1-Flag-His6 tag fusion is stored in a suitable medium, such as 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% TRITON® X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 % glycerol, pH 7.5, at -80 °C in small aliquots until use.  The identity of the purified Plk1-Flag-His6 tag fusion protein is confirmed by MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization). <br><br>
Expression and purification of GST-Cdc25C(1-206).<br>
Human Cdc25C cDNA, which may be obtained from any appropriate source, may be expressed in any convenient expression system, after which purification is effected by well known methods similar to that described by Bin Ouyang et al, Oncogene, 18, 6029 -6036 (1999).  One convenient system involves overnight growth at 18 ºC of E.coli BL21 tranformed with the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham) into which the cDNA for human Cds25C has been engineered for induced expression using 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.  The expressed GST-Cdc25C(1-206), the substrate for Plk1, may be purified (for example, by GLUTATHIONE SEPHAROSE® 4B) and stored in an appropriate solution, such as 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 in small aliquots at -80 °C.  <br>
Plk1 Inhibition Assay<br>
Plk1 kinase reactions contain Plk1-Flag-His6 tag fusion enzyme (0.2 ng/µL) in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 5.0 µM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% TRITON® X-100, 0.4 µCi 33P-ATP, and 0.06 µg/µL GST-Cdc25c (1-206) peptide.  Compounds are provided as 10 mM stocks in DMSO.  Compounds are serially diluted 1:3 in 20 % DMSO to create a 10-point concentration-response curve and subsequently are diluted 1:5 (20 µM to 0.001 µM final in 4 % final DMSO concentration) in the reaction mixture to determine compound activity.  The reaction is carried out at RT for 60 min and then quenched by adding 60 µL of 10.0 % H3PO4.  The reaction mixture (85 µL) is transferred to a 96 well phosphocellulose filter plate pre-wetted with 30 µL of 10.0 % H3PO4, incubated at RT for 20-30 min and then washed 3X with 0.5 % H3PO4.  Wells are dried before addition of 40 µL of MicroScintTM20 (Packard) and then counted on a Wallac MICROBETA ® Jet.  The percentage inhibition values from the 10-point concentration response data are subsequently analyzed, for example, using ACTIVITY BASE™ software (IDBS), using a 4-parameter logistic equation.  Absolute IC50 values are calculated from the resulting curve fit.  All exemplified compounds have an IC50 less than 100 nM with a Minimum Significant Ratio (MSR) for the IC50 of 3.6, with the caveat that either the racemic mixture and/or at least one enantiomer had an IC50 less than 100 nM.    For example, Example 41 racemate has an IC50 of 12 nM.  This demonstrates that the compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of Plk1.<br>
pHH3(S10), mitotic cells, and DNA content Assays<br>
HeLa Cells are plated at  200 cells/well in 96 well Beckman Dickinson BIOCOAT™ plates, and are incubated in MEM (Minimum Essential Medium) with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) in 37 °C, 5 % CO2 for 24 hours.  Cells are treated by adding compound (in 0.25 % DMSO) to the medium, dosing at 10 points across the range 0.5 µM to 0.0098 µM.  After 23 hours exposure to the compounds, cells are fixed, for example with the PREFER™ fixative for 30 min then are permeablized with 0.1% TRITON® X100 in phospate buffered saline (PBS) solution for 15 min.  Cells are washed 3 times with PBS then digested with 50 µg/mL RNAse.  Primary antibody, phosphohistone H3, is added at 1:500 in PBS with 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the cells over night at 4 °C.  After 3 PBS washes, cells are incubated with Alexa488 labeled secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT.  Again they are washed 3 times with PBS, and then 15 µM propidium iodide is added for 30 min to stain nuclei.  Fluorescence Plates are scanned with ACUMEN EXPLORER™ [Laser-scanning fluorescence microplate cytometer (comprising of 488 nm argon ion laser excitation and multiple photomultiplier tube detection), manufactured by TTP LABTECH LTD] to measure anti-phosphohistone H3 Serine 10, DNA content and mitotic cells as measured by DNA condensation.  Image analysis are based on cellular fluorescent signals for identifying cells in different subpopulations.  pHH3(S10) positive cells are identified by mean intensity at 500-530 nm above the threshold.  Total intensity at 655-705 nm from propidium iodide/DNA is used to identify individual cells (cells with DNA content from 2N to 4N) and subpopulations in cell cycle (2N cells, 4N cells).  Peak intensity at 575-640 nm is used to identify DNA condensation that is used as the marker to identify mitotic cells among 4N cells.  Assay outputs are percentage of each identified subpopulations, % pHH3, % 2N, % 4N, %mitotic and total cell number.  The EC50 is determined by curve fitting to a four parameter logistic for each output using ACTIVITY BASE™.  The resulting EC50s for pHH3(s10), DNA content, and mitotic have an MSR of 2.6, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively.  For example, Example 41 racemate has an pHH3(s10) EC50 =  25 nM, DNA content EC50 =  30 nM and mitotic EC50 =  23 nM.<br><br>
Antiproliferative Assay.<br>
The effects of compounds on cell proliferation can be determined using cells and cell proliferation methods well-known in the art (Robert C. Squatrito et al., Gynecological Oncology, 58, 101-105, (1995)).  For example, HCT116 cells, which may be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, may be seeded at ~2000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 ºC.  Following the 20-24 hour incubation, half-log serially diluted compounds are added and the plates are returned to the incubator.  After an appropriate length of exposure (e.g., 72 hours), cell proliferation is estimated using well-known methods.  In one method, 10 ?L of a tetrazolium salt, such as Alamar Blue™ is added to the cell plates.  After an appropriate exposure to the dye, fluorescence (530 nm excitation, 580 nm emission) is determined.  The resulting IC50 has an MSR of 3.1.  For example, Example 41 racemate has an average IC50 = 31 nM (n = 2).  This demonstrates that the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating proliferative disorders, including types of cancer.<br><br>
	The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes.  Most preferably, such compositions are for oral or intravenous administration.  Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art.  See, e.g., REMINGTON:  THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY (A. Gennaro, et al., eds., 19th ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995).  <br><br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound such as herein described, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient showed unexpected and surprising results.  Therefore, the said composition is synergistic.<br><br><br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range.  For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 1 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 2 to 6.5 mg/kg of body weight.  In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.  It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br><br>
