				<td>AN AUTO FOLDING CANOPY SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an auto folding canopy system for vehicles particularly, but not limited to, heavy commercial vehicles.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Canopy is needed to cover the commercial vehicles in order to protect the goods/items, being carried in the vehicle, from the adverse weather conditions like rain, sun, wind etc. In case of heavy commercial vehicles, the canopy becomes quite bulky and it becomes quite difficult to fold or unfold the canopy for unloading or loading of goods/items from the top of the vehicle. Further, mechanical structures are also required to be erected, temporarily or permanently, on the vehicle for the mounting of the canopy. The erection of these mechanical structures could be quite bulky and it requires time to erect these mechanical structures on the vehicle. The total time involved in erecting mechanical structures on a body and putting canopy on these structures may become quite time consuming requiring a number of persons to complete the entire process. Further, permanent erection of these structures on the vehicle may not be desirable as it obstructs the loading of the goods/items from the top of the vehicle in certain applications.<br>
In case of vehicles having no mechanical structures on the vehicle, the canopy is simply spread over the goods and is tied with the body of the vehicle through J- hooks to provide some sort of protection. However, such canopies, known in the prior art, suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
Primary disadvantage of such canopies, known in the prior art, is that these canopies do not provide complete cover and security to the goods inside the vehicle and in the case of items with projections/protrusions, the items may tear the canopy itself.<br>
Another disadvantage of such canopies, known in the prior art, is that the entire operation of mounting these canopies on the vehicle is manual requiring number of persons<br>
Yet further disadvantage of such canopies, known in the prior art, is that the entire operation of mounting these canopies takes large amount of time for tying of canopy with the hooks provided in the body of the vehicle.<br>
Some of the canopy systems, known in the prior art, are designed to be mounted over permanent mechanical structures provided in the vehicles. Such type of canopy systems provide improved security to the goods/items being carried in the vehicle. However, even these improved canopy systems, known in the art, also suffer from following disadvantages.<br><br>
Primary disadvantage of such canopy systems, known in the prior art, is that in case of vehicles with such canopies, the loading of goods/items of large dimensions is done through the sides only. Once the goods are loaded through the sides, the canopy is mounted through the hooks provided on the sides of the vehicles.<br>
Another disadvantage of such canopy systems, known in the art, is that in such canopies the tying of canopy with the hooks provided in the sides of the body takes a lot of time and involves more than one person<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Primary object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which is totally automatic for covering/uncovering of the top portion of the canopy on any vehicle.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an integral auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which is complete with a top canopy; two sides canopy as well a hydraulic mechanism to fold/unfold the top canopy.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which can be folded/unfolded with the operation of a control lever.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which can be mounted within minutes to completely cover the top as well as side canopies on a vehicle making the operation very fast.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which can be operated by a single person.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which is simpler and easy to operate.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an auto-folding canopy system, which makes the loading/unloading of goods/items from the top in a commercial vehiclejexpeditious.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which has a string and pulley mechanism for folding/unfolding of two side canopies.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an auto folding canopy system for vehicles, which is complete with a top canopy, two side canopies and a hydraulic system. The canopy system of the present<br><br>
invention utilises the hydraulic system for folding/unfolding of the top canopy and string and pulley mechanism for folding/unfolding of the side canopies. The canopy system is easy to operate and it can be folded or unfolded by a single person. The canopy of the present system can be mounted over the vehicle within minutes saving the precious time. The canopy system of the present invention facilitates the loading of the items in the vehicle from top as the top portion of the canopy system can unfold quickly with the operation of the hydraulic motor provided in the canopy system. The canopy system is extremely useful for the situations where the loading or unloading of the items inside the vehicles has to be done very quickly.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
. Any further characteristics, advantages and applications of the invention will become evident from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which has been described and illustrated with the help of following drawings wherein,<br>
Fig. 1 shows the isometric view of the canopy system of the present invention mounted on a vehicle<br>
Fig. 2 shows an end view of the canopy system of the present invention<br>
Description of the invention w.r.t. drawings<br>
Referring to Fig.1, the Auto Folding Canopy System of the present invention comprises two side canopies (1), a top canopy (6), string and pulley mechanism (2) for folding or unfolding side canopy and pair of chain &amp; sprocket mechanisms (9) for folding or unfolding of top canopy (6) which is driven by a hydraulic motor (11) . Each of the side canopies (1) of the canopy system is made in three separate pieces. Each of these six pieces (for both the side canopies) can be folded or unfolded using different sets of string and pulley mechanism (2). The side canopy (1) is made of standard canopy cloth in which wires (5) are embedded making the reference lines along which the canopy fold/unfolds in a ziz zag manner similar to bellows. These side canopies (1) are mounted /supported on the side pillars (4) erected on the floor of the vehicle.<br>
The top canopy (6) comprises of two portions, which are separately supported by plurality of structural members (8) and two side rods (7). Each of these portions of top canopy (6) is hinged on the side rod (7), which, in turn, is supported on plurality of side pillars (4) erected on the vehicle. These side rods (4) also support the pulleys (3) of the string and pulley mechanism (2). Further, each of these two portions of top canopy (6) is capable of swinging around side rod (7). Each of the side rods (7) is capable of rotation with the help of bushes provided in the side pillar (4). These side rods (7) can be rotated by a pair of chain and sorocket mechanisms (9) each of which is provided for the two portions of the top canopy (6). One of the chain and<br><br>
Sprocket mechanisms (9) is mounted on one of the side rod (7) and the other one is mounted on output shaft of the hydraulic motor (11). Two separate close loops of chain and rope (10), traversing through these sprockets are provided for the rotation of these two sprocket mechanisms (9). Chain is provided on those portions of the loop which are required to traverse over the sprocket, the remaining portion of the loops are made by attaching wire ropes to the chains. The sprocket and chain mechanisms (9) are driven by hydraulic motor assembly (11). Running the hydraulic motor (11) in one direction unfolds the tip portion of the canopy and running it in the other direction folds the top portions to the canopy (6).<br>
Fig.(2) shows the end view of the top canopy in folded and unfolded condition. When loading of goods/items from the top of the vehicle is required, the top canopy (6) is unfolded with the help of hydraulic motor (11) and is swung back on the sides of the vehicle. After the loading of the goods from the top, the canopy is folded back again with the hydraulic motor (11) in order to provide cover to the items/goods loaded in the vehicle. Similarly, with the help of string and pulley mechanism (2), the sides of the vehicle can be opened or closed.<br>
The present embodiment of the invention, which has been set forth above, was for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is to be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications can be made in the invention described above by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention, which has been defined by following claims:<br><br><br><br>
