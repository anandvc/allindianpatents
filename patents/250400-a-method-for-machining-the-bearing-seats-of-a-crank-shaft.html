Method for machining the bearing seats of shafts<br>
The invention relates to a method for machining the bearing seats<br>
of shafts, especially of crankshafts, wherein the bearing seats<br>
are subjected to a plurality of machining operations after a<br>
shaft has been initially formed by forging or casting.<br>
Conventionally, the bearing seats of shafts, such as the seats of<br>
the main bearings and of the thrust bearings of crankshafts, are<br>
machined by multi-stage chip-removing processes. According to a<br>
typical machining sequence in this regard, the forged or cast<br>
crankshaft is first rough-machined by turning, milling or turn<br>
broaching, then semifinish-machined by grinding and finally<br>
subjected to finish machining. In particular, now that it has<br>
become standard practice to harden the bearing seats, not least<br>
to protect them from damage in the course of further manufacture,<br>
the machining routinely includes rotary grinding after hardening,<br>
since for many years grinding was the only usable method for<br>
reducing bearings to their final dimensions after they had been<br>
hardened.<br>
Rotary milling of the bearing seats of shafts has also been<br>
proposed repeatedly, as has already been done in DE 212950 and AT<br>
286067, for example. In such a case, a milling cutter turning<br>
around an axis of rotation disposed perpendicular to the axis of<br>
the bearing seat to be machined is moved with tangential feed<br>
along the rotating workpiece. More recently, such suggestions<br>
have reappeared, especially to avoid wet grinding and the expense<br>
associated with disposal of the waste products produced during<br>
grinding.<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
2<br>
For example, WO 97/32680 Al (this document will be abbreviated as<br>
Dl hereinafter) proposes a method for machining bearing seats of<br>
crankshafts without wet grinding, wherein the crankshaft is<br>
rotated at approximately 20 to 100 rpm by means of a holding<br>
fixture in which it is clamped and mounted so as to be driven in<br>
rotation around its longitudinal axis, which coincides with the C<br>
axis of the machine, and is machined with a milling tool, which<br>
can be rotated around its A axis (which is parallel to the<br>
X direction of the machine) in a tool spindle, can be infed to<br>
the workpiece along its axis and can be fed perpendicular to its<br>
axis (in Y direction of the machine; tangentially relative to the<br>
workpiece). The corresponding machining takes place in two<br>
stages.<br>
According to the explanations in Dl (page 11, lines 11 to 25), in<br>
order to allow for the different stresses and strains on the<br>
cutting tool and the quality to be achieved by the machining<br>
operation, the tangential feed rate is controlled in such a way<br>
that the circumferential cutters of the milling tool have optimal<br>
cutting conditions during the rough-machining phase (roughing)<br>
and that the end blades can act on the entire running seat during<br>
finish-machining (smoothing) of the running seat. According to<br>
page 4, line 27 to page 5, line 9 of Dl, the high cutting speeds<br>
necessary for high-speed cutting can be achieved by appropriately<br>
high speeds of revolution of the rotary milling tool, while the<br>
crankshaft can nevertheless be rotated at the usual speed of up<br>
to approximately 100 rpm, as is also used during grinding in<br>
order to achieve high quality of the workpiece. Because of the<br>
high cutting speeds, the stresses and strains on the workpiece<br>
are supposedly small and very good three-dimensional geometry can<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
3<br>
be achieved. With a tool matched to the contour of the bearing<br>
seat, the tangential feed of the rotary milling tool permits<br>
machining of the entire width of the bearing seat in one work<br>
cycle. The conventionally provided steps of rough machining and<br>
grinding machining of the bearing seats could be combined - in<br>
one machine and with one clamping of the crankshaft - in one<br>
working step, and so considerable streamlining could be achieved.<br>
On the milling tool, there are provided three cutting tips made<br>
of common types of cutting materials and equipped respectively<br>
with an end cutter and a circumferential cutter. The cutting tip<br>
geometry is adapted to the geometry of the bearing seat to be<br>
machined as regards transition radius, flat shoulders, etc. (see<br>
D1 page 6, line 33 to page 7, line 5).<br>
In view of the throw height of the crankshaft, the known rotary<br>
milling tool must be very elongated (protruding length) to ensure<br>
that it can undertake machining of the bearing seat (see Dl page<br>
8, lines 18 to 20).<br>
In summary, there are proposed in Dl a method and a device that<br>
supposedly permit short cycle times and very good quality during<br>
machining of the (unhardened) bearing seats of crankshafts by<br>
using high-speed rotary milling, so that the machining step of<br>
grinding can be made completely unnecessary (see Dl page 15,<br>
lines 22 to 27).<br>
From EP 1030755 B1 (this document is abbreviated as D2<br>
hereinafter) there is known the machining of crankshafts by the<br>
following sequence of machining steps: chip removal - hardening -<br>
chip removal - finishing. In this connection, it is explained<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
4<br>
that the bearing faces are hardened in their near-surface zones,<br>
especially in the case of steel crankshafts. This serves the<br>
purpose of increasing the wear resistance of the bearing<br>
locations, preventing damage to these bearing faces during<br>
handling throughout the entire manufacturing process, and<br>
influencing the strength characteristics of the crankshaft (see<br>
D2 column 1, lines 23 to 30). The technical starting point of the<br>
ideas in D2 is the conventional machining of crankshafts in four<br>
steps: The first step is chip-removing machining with specific<br>
cutters; in this connection there is also mentioned rotary<br>
milling, and in particular high-speed milling. In the subsequent<br>
second machining step, the bearing face of the crankshaft is<br>
hardened. The third step relates to grinding by means of a hard,<br>
massive grinding tool, such as a grinding wheel. Finally, in the<br>
fourth step, finishing is achieved by a grinding belt or<br>
grindstone, which is usually stationary and is pressed against<br>
the outer circumference of the rotating bearing location of the<br>
crankshaft. The material allowance abraded during finishing<br>
ranges from 1 to 10 urn (see D2 column 2, line 32 to column 3,<br>
line 15) .<br>
In order to lower the costs of crankshaft machining, it is<br>
endeavored according to D2 to reduce the machining of the bearing<br>
locations from four to three different machining steps (see D2<br>
column 3, lines 21 to 24). By omitting machining by grinding, the<br>
machining sequence is reduced from four to only three machining<br>
methods that are different in principle. Consequently, disposal<br>
problems for elimination of grinding sludge should cease to<br>
exist, investment costs for grinding machines and costs for tool<br>
consumption would no longer be incurred, and last but not least,<br>
a larger inventory of workpieces would no longer be needed to<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
5<br>
compensate for the prolonged turnaround time of the workpieces<br>
caused by grinding. In contrast, disposal of the chips from chip-<br>
removing machining causes no problems, since either dry cutting<br>
will be possible (high-speed milling) or complete separation of<br>
chips and oil can be achieved because the specific surface of the<br>
chips is much smaller than that of grinding dust (see D2 column<br>
4, lines 21 to 33).<br>
A further consideration relevant to the grinding of bearing<br>
locations that has been practiced heretofore is that the<br>
roundness deviations resulting from chip-removing rough-machining<br>
are usually reduced only in their absolute size but not in their<br>
nature by grinding. Thus grinding would not reduce long-period<br>
roundness deviations to short-period roundness deviations, but<br>
instead the number of undulations in the shaft would either<br>
remain the same or decrease, with the consequence that further<br>
improvement of the roundness deviations by finishing, considered<br>
as an improvement in the result per unit time, would actually<br>
become more difficult during finishing (see D2 column 7, line 49<br>
to column 8, line 3).<br>
According to D2, hardening is followed by more material removal<br>
by chip-removing machining, especially the second chip-removing<br>
machining step (finish chip removal) of a two-stage metal-cutting<br>
operation (see D2 column 9, lines 20 to 24).<br>
What is common to the comments in D1 and D2, therefore, is that<br>
multi-stage rotary milling machining of the bearing seats by wet<br>
grinding should be avoided. In this way, as explained, the<br>
quality of manufacture could be increased and the costs incurred<br>
due to elimination of the grinding sludge could be lowered for<br>
both unhardened (see Dl) and hardened (see D2) bearing seats.<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT7EP2005/012634<br>
6<br>
Because of this, the unanimous, known interpretation that multi-<br>
stage rotary milling machining should be integrated into rough-<br>
machining. This interpretation is not invalidated even by the<br>
fact that, as the possible combination of machining sequences up<br>
to the ready-to-use condition of a crankshaft, there is mentioned<br>
the following: chip removal - hardening - chip removal -<br>
finishing (see D2 column 4, lines 50 to 54).<br>
The present invention is based on the knowledge that, starting<br>
from the structural complexity of crankshafts and other shafts<br>
with bearing seats, especially with eccentric bearing seats,<br>
optimization of manufacturing costs and working result cannot be<br>
achieved with the known measures alone. Its object is to provide<br>
a method for machining the bearing seats of shafts in a manner<br>
than can contribute to manufacture of shafts satisfying stringent<br>
quality requirements at comparatively low costs.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a method<br>
for machining the bearing seats of shafts, wherein the bearing<br>
seats are subjected to the following machining operations after a<br>
shaft has been initially formed by forging or casting:<br>
- rough-shaping by chip-removing machining with specific<br>
cutters,<br>
- hardening,<br>
- passing through dressing rollers,<br>
- rough rotary milling and<br>
- finish rotary milling,<br>
wherein the rough rotary milling and the finish rotary milling<br>
are respectively applied substantially during one complete<br>
revolution of the shaft, without longitudinal feed and without<br>
tangential feed of the milling cutter. According to the<br>
invention, therefore, hardening of the bearing seats is followed<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
7<br>
by a multi-stage process of chip-removing machining with specific<br>
cutters, wherein rotary milling takes place in rough-cutting and<br>
finish-cutting steps, and the position of the milling cutter does<br>
not change relative to the axis of the bearing to be machined<br>
during the respective revolution in question of the shaft, or in<br>
other words between the lead-in cut and the exit of the milling<br>
cutter. By virtue of the hardness of the material to be removed<br>
and the multi-stage nature of the rotary milling machining, only<br>
relatively small, stress-annealed chips are produced, and they<br>
can be disposed of in dry condition and without problems. By the<br>
fact that the crankshaft or other shaft is rotated, in terms of<br>
order of magnitude, only by approximately one complete revolution<br>
during rough rotary milling and also during finish-rotary milling<br>
respectively, which includes rotation of the shaft by<br>
approximately one and one half complete revolutions, as will be<br>
explained in more detail hereinafter, the rotary milling<br>
machining can be accomplished within a minimal time.<br>
During rotary milling machining, the axis of the rotary milling<br>
tool is offset relative to the axis of the bearing seat to be<br>
machined by an eccentricity, which is retained or in other words<br>
is constant during the corresponding machining stage, preferably<br>
including the phases of immersion and retraction of the tool. By<br>
the fact that a feed movement of the milling cutter transverse to<br>
its longitudinal axis, or in other words in Y direction or<br>
tangentially relative to the workpiece, does not occur during<br>
rotary milling machining, the machining speed (relative feed) is<br>
guided alone by the circumferential velocity of the shaft and the<br>
radius of the bearing seat to be machined. In this connection,<br>
for example, the following machining speeds are achieved:<br>
Relative feed between approximately 200 mm/min and 9000 mm/min,<br>
preferably between approximately 600 mm/min and 1500 mm/min;<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
8<br>
cutting speed approximately between 60 m/min and 600 m/min,<br>
preferably between approximately 80 m/min and 120 m/min. The<br>
offset of the axis of the milling cutter relative to the axis of<br>
the bearing seat to be machined depends on the bearing geometry<br>
and corresponds preferably to 0.1 to 0.25 times the value,<br>
particularly preferably 0.15 to 0.2 times the value of the<br>
diameter of the milling cutter. Because of the eccentricity of<br>
the milling cutter, the end cutters can embrace the complete<br>
bearing seat. The eccentricity can be optimized to reduce the<br>
vibration behavior. The shaft can be rotated in the direction of<br>
the eccentricity or in the opposite direction during rotary<br>
milling machining.<br>
According to a special aspect of the present invention, the<br>
workpiece is gauged after rough rotary milling and the infeed of<br>
the milling head for finish rotary milling is determined as a<br>
function of the result of this measurement. This gauging of the<br>
bearing seats after rough rotary milling is performed on the<br>
clamped shaft, so that rough rotary milling, gauging and finish<br>
rotary milling take place in a direct sequence. Depending on the<br>
individual conditions, an equally large or a different machining<br>
allowance of the machining face can be removed during the<br>
individual steps of rotary milling machining of the bearing<br>
seats. The second of these options is regularly particularly<br>
favorable, specifically when organized such that preferably<br>
approximately 60 to 80% and particularly preferably approximately<br>
65 to 75% of the machining allowance remaining after hardening,<br>
is removed during rough rotary milling and the rest is removed<br>
during finish rotary milling.<br>
Depending on the requirements of surface quality as well as on<br>
other boundary conditions, rotary milling may or may not be<br>
followed by finishing of the bearing seats. From cost viewpoints,<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
9<br>
a procedure without finishing is particularly preferred. This is<br>
also feasible in principle, since the surface irregularities<br>
still present after finish rotary machining, because of the<br>
nature of the method, run transverse and not parallel relative to<br>
the direction of movement in the bearing. Thus they are evened<br>
out more rapidly during operation, and the danger that the<br>
lubricant film will break away from them locally is smaller than<br>
in the case of marks running along the direction of movement in<br>
the bearing.<br>
According to another preferred improvement of the invention, the<br>
infeed of the milling cutter during immersion at the beginning of<br>
rough rotary milling and at the beginning of finish rotary<br>
milling respectively has only an axial component relative to the<br>
axis of the milling cutter. In other words, in each case the<br>
milling cutter is infed along its longitudinal axis and bears<br>
radially on the workpiece, while the shaft is being rotated by a<br>
certain amount (see hereinafter). This is advantageous in<br>
preventing the production of a "dent" in the material to be<br>
removed during immersion of the milling cutter. Because such<br>
denting can be avoided in this way, the machining allowance<br>
existing before rotary milling can be correspondingly small (for<br>
example, only 0.35 mm), which is favorable for the economy of<br>
multi-stage rotary milling machining. It has proved particularly<br>
favorable when immersion of the milling cutter in the material to<br>
be removed, at its position that is critical for rough rotary<br>
milling, extends over an angle of rotation of approximately 3 to<br>
15°, particularly preferably approximately 5° in the crankshaft<br>
or other shaft. An analogous condition applies for immersion of<br>
the milling cutter during finish rotary milling.<br>
Another preferred improvement of the invention is characterized<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
10<br>
in that the diameter of the milling cutter used for rotary<br>
milling is larger than the width of the bearing seat to be<br>
machined. Particularly preferably, the diameter of the milling<br>
cutter used for rotary milling is approximately 1.15 to 1.35<br>
times the amount of the width of the bearing seat to be machined.<br>
In this case, a relief groove in which the milling cutter can run<br>
out during rotary milling machining is expediently made during<br>
rough-shaping on both sides of the bearing seat to be produced.<br>
Taking these parameters into consideration, the profile of the<br>
irregularities remaining on the surface of the bearing seats<br>
after rotary milling machining is favorable for maintaining a<br>
lubricant film.<br>
If the present invention is used for machining the bearing seats<br>
of a crankshaft, it is advantageous for the crankshaft to be<br>
clamped for multi-stage rotary milling machining at its flange<br>
end in a first rotatable chuck and at its journal end in a second<br>
rotatable chuck. Particularly preferably, these two chucks can be<br>
driven synchronously and rotated with a speed of revolution of<br>
between 1 and 100 rpm.<br>
The bearing seats of the individual main bearings of a crankshaft<br>
are expediently machined successively with a single rotary<br>
milling tool, while the crankshaft preferably is braced<br>
simultaneously in radial direction by one or by two steadies on<br>
at least one adjacent main bearing. By bracing with steadies, it<br>
is ensured that the crankshaft will not bow under the machining<br>
forces and therefore that the machining result will not be<br>
impaired.<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
11<br>
In analogous manner, the bearing seats of the individual thrust<br>
bearings are expediently machined successively with a single<br>
rotary milling cutter, while the crankshaft is braced<br>
simultaneously in radial direction by a steady on at least one<br>
main bearing adjacent to the thrust bearing being machined.<br>
Alternatively, a plurality of main or thrust bearings may each be<br>
machined simultaneously with a plurality of rotary milling tools.<br>
An appropriate plurality of rotary milling tools is provided for<br>
this purpose.<br>
It is especially advantageous for multi-stage rotary milling<br>
machining if each bearing seat has its own individual NC control<br>
program running. A prerequisite for such individual control is<br>
the existence of measuring devices and measuring programs, with<br>
which the individual machining result of rough milling machining<br>
is recorded directly and used in the NC program of the machine<br>
for machining the bearing seat in question during finish rotary<br>
milling machining. Preferably, as explained, the measurements are<br>
made after the rough cutting step of multi-stage rotary milling<br>
machining, and then infeed is undertaken for the finish-cutting<br>
step. By virtue of recent developments, such complex NC control<br>
of the machining machine is now possible without difficulty.<br>
The invention also relates to a machine tool for performing the<br>
method. The machine tool possesses:<br>
- a main spindle with an axis of rotation (C axis) in Z<br>
direction, corresponding to the main axis of rotation of a<br>
shaft to be machined,<br>
- a chuck that can be driven in rotation around the C axis,<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
12<br>
at least one tool spindle that can be rotated around the A<br>
axis, which runs parallel to the X direction, and that can<br>
be displaced in the Y direction and in the Z direction,<br>
at least one steady that can be displaced along the Z<br>
direction and that has at least one bracing point for the<br>
shaft at one of its bearings,<br>
a tailstock with a lathe center or a second chuck.<br>
During machining of the bearings of a crankshaft in a machine<br>
with two chucks that can be driven in rotation, the first chuck<br>
holds the crankshaft at its flange end and the second chuck holds<br>
the crankshaft at its journal. In each case, the crankshaft is<br>
clamped with its axis of rotation along the C axis (in Z<br>
direction) of the machine tool.<br>
The axis of rotation (A axis) of the tool spindle containing the<br>
rotary milling tool runs parallel to the X direction of the<br>
machine, which in turn runs orthogonally relative to the Z<br>
direction. The tool spindle for the rotary milling tool is also<br>
provided with a device in order to make the tool spindle<br>
adjustable for adjusting the eccentricity (the offset) between<br>
the axis of the bearing to be machined and the tool axis in the Y<br>
direction of the machine. Finally, the tool spindle can also be<br>
displaced and immobilized in the Z direction of the machine tool,<br>
in order that the individual bearing seats can be machined in<br>
succession.<br>
Particularly preferably, the machine controller makes it<br>
possible, instead of the above-explained infeed movement of the<br>
milling cutter alone in its longitudinal direction, also to<br>
execute an infeed movement of the rotary milling tool comprising<br>
both an axial component (in X direction) and a radial component<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
13<br>
(in Y direction) during immersion in the bearing location to be<br>
machined at the beginning of rough rotary milling and of finish<br>
rotary milling. This makes it possible to react flexibly to<br>
special circumstances of the individual case, by an infeed<br>
movement that is particularly suitable for the specific<br>
application.<br>
For machining of seat faces of thrust bearings, the tool spindle<br>
is provided with a device allowing it to oscillate in coordinated<br>
manner in the direction of the X axis and of the Y axis, so that<br>
it can follow the circular movements of the thrust bearing during<br>
rotation of the crankshaft around its main axis.<br>
The tool spindle is preferably equipped to hold a milling finger,<br>
whose shank has a length-to-diameter ratio ranging between 10:1.5<br>
and 10:3. Such slenderness of the milling finger is the<br>
prerequisite for all bearing faces (generated faces) to be<br>
machinable with the tool while the crankshaft is rotating.<br>
Another prerequisite for slenderness, however, is that the shank<br>
of the milling finger has high flexural strength. It is<br>
advantageous for the shank of the milling finger to be made of<br>
hard metal - or other materials with high flexural strength. The<br>
milling finger is preferably clamped in a shrink-fit chuck.<br>
To achieve steady and uniform cutting, preferably at least three<br>
end cutters comprising CBN (cubic boron nitride) cutting tips<br>
fixed by solder or other suitable means or comprising one cutting<br>
tip made of a suitable other cutting material are provided on the<br>
finger cutter.<br>
The CBN or other cutting tips each preferably have a chamfer, so<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
 14<br>
that the height of the cutting edges above a normal plane<br>
decreases by a small amount from the outside circumference of the<br>
milling finger to its axis. By such a chamfer it is possible to<br>
achieve a convex (crowned) form of the bearing faces, which is<br>
favorable in particular for crankshafts. This chamfer of the end<br>
tool cutters, produced by surface grinding, can be in particular<br>
approximately 0.04 to 0.1 mm. Preferably the ratio of the speeds<br>
of the chuck or chucks to the speed of the tool spindle can range<br>
from 1:400 to 1:2000. The cutting speeds are preferably on the<br>
order of magnitude of between 80 and 600 m/min. If necessary, the<br>
tool can be cooled internally.<br>
Bracing of the respective bearing seats not currently being<br>
machined is preferably to be provided by a steady (see above). It<br>
is expediently achieved on a main bearing, at three points, one<br>
of which lies in the X direction (relative to the rotary milling<br>
tool). In order to preclude disturbances of bracing by the<br>
necessary oil bores in the main and thrust bearings, the bracing<br>
faces of the steady are preferably designed as sliding blocks,<br>
which in the region of the oil bores of the main-bearing seats<br>
each have a recess in the form of a groove. In addition, the<br>
sliding blocks can be adapted to the surface contour of the<br>
generating line of the bearing, especially via hollow grinding<br>
matched to the bearing diameter. This prevents ingress of chips<br>
in the region of the bracing of the shaft on the sliding block or<br>
steady in question, and in this way it prevents damage to the<br>
bearing used for bracing the shaft.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, the special advantages of the present<br>
invention are evident in particular for crankshafts and other<br>
shafts whose bearing seats are hardened. However, if hardening of<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
15<br>
the bearing seats is not necessary either in regard to protecting<br>
them during further handling or in regard to the desired wear<br>
resistance, it is conceivable that the inventive procedure can be<br>
used without hardening of the bearing seats. In this case, less<br>
stringent requirements would be imposed on the cutters of the<br>
rotary milling tool. In addition, the machining allowance for<br>
rotary milling machining could be smaller than for hardened<br>
bearing seats, since the shrinkage that occurs regularly during<br>
hardening would not be a factor, and this is favorable from<br>
viewpoints of manufacturing economy. To this extent, the<br>
Applicant reserves the right to claim separate protection for<br>
such a procedure via a divisional application.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with<br>
reference to a practical example.<br>

Crankshaft 1 - rough-shaped by chip removal, hardened and passed<br>
through dressing rollers - is clamped to rotate around its main<br>
axis of rotation 2 in the machine tool (not illustrated), in<br>
which its main and thrust bearing seats will be machined.<br>
Beginning at journal 3, the main bearings are designated<br>
successively as HL 1 to HL 5. The numbering of the thrust<br>
bearings is similar. Beginning at journal 3, they are designated<br>
successively as PL 1 to PL 4 in the drawing. The end of<br>
crankshaft 1 opposite journal 3 is flange 4. In the present<br>
example, crankshaft 1 is clamped at flange 4 by a chuck, two jaws<br>
5 of which are illustrated. As shown by the direction of arrows<br>
6, the clamping forces act in radial direction on flange 4.<br>
Axis of rotation 2 of crankshaft 1 is also the C axis of the<br>
machine tool running in Z direction. Beginning at flange 4, main<br>
bearings HL 5 to HL 1 of crankshaft 1 are machined successively<br>
according to arrow 9. During machining in the direction of arrow<br>
9, which is the X direction of the machine tool, crankshaft 1 is<br>
braced in the direction of arrow 10, which is opposite to the<br>
machining direction. Bracing in the direction of arrow 10 is<br>
accomplished by one or two steadies (not illustrated) of the<br>
machine tool. This machining of HL 5 takes place with bracing at<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
17<br>
HL 4, machining of HL 4 takes place with bracing at HL 3,<br>
machining of HL 3 takes place with bracing at HL 4 and/or HL 2,<br>
machining of HL 2 takes place with bracing at HL 3 and machining<br>
of HL 1 takes place with bracing at HL 2. Bracing during<br>
machining of thrust bearings PL 1 to PL 4 is provided in similar<br>
manner. During machining of PL 1, for example in machining<br>
direction 11, bracing is provided at HL 1 and/or HL 2. Machining<br>
of PL 2 in turn takes place with bracing at HL 2 and/or HL 3,<br>
machining of PL 3 takes place with bracing at HL 3 and/or HL 4,<br>
and finally machining of PL 4 takes place with bracing at HL 4 or<br>
HL 5. For simplicity, it is assumed that machining direction 11<br>
corresponds to machining direction 9 and therefore to the X<br>
direction of the machine tool.<br>
A milling finger 12 as illustrated in Fig. 2 is provided for<br>
machining of bearing seats HL and PL. In the present practical<br>
example, diameter 13 of the milling finger is 24 mm, whereas the<br>
width of main bearing seats HL and of thrust bearing seats PL is<br>
19 mm. Accordingly, a relief groove of 2.5 mm, in which the<br>
milling cutter can run out, has been made on both sides of each<br>
of the bearing seats during rough machining of the crankshaft.<br>
Relative to its diameter 13, shank 15 of milling finger 12 has a<br>
great length 14. The great length 14 of shank 15 makes it<br>
possible that, for example, thrust bearing faces PL 1 or PL 4 can<br>
be machined from directions 9 and 11 even if - after<br>
approximately one half revolution of the crankshaft - they are<br>
located in the lower position, in which the two inner thrust<br>
bearings are illustrated in Fig. 1. For this purpose, shank 15 of<br>
milling finger 12 has high flexural strength. Shank 15 is<br>
inserted into a standard tool holder 16 of the tool spindle (not<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
18<br>
illustrated) of the machine tool. Axis of rotation 17 of milling<br>
finger 12 is also parallel to the X direction of the machine<br>
tool.<br>
Viewed from the direction of arrow A (Fig. 3), milling finger 12<br>
is provided with three cutting tips 18, which are distributed<br>
uniformly over the circumference. Cutting tips 18 are made of<br>
cubic boron nitride, abbreviated as CBN. Each of cutting tips 18<br>
has a slight chamfer 19 toward axis of rotation 17.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a section through an arbitrary main bearing HL of<br>
crankshaft 1. The C axis of the machine tool lies in the same<br>
direction as axis of rotation 2; the Z axis, which coincides with<br>
the C axis, therefore runs perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
drawing. The X axis extends orthogonally relative thereto, and in<br>
turn the Y axis extends orthogonally relative to the X axis and<br>
to the Z axis. Relative to the X axis, axis of rotation 17 of<br>
milling finger 12 is offset in Y direction by eccentricity e,<br>
which in the present practical example amounts to approximately 4<br>
to 5 mm. The direction of rotation of crankshaft 1 is indicated<br>
by curved arrow 20, and the direction of rotation of milling<br>
finger 12 is indicated by curved arrow 21.<br>
Machining allowance 22 (for example, 0.35 mm) is provided for<br>
multi-stage rotary milling machining of main bearing HL. During<br>
rough cutting, in which crankshaft 1 performs approximately one<br>
complete revolution in direction 20, an outer layer 23 with a<br>
predetermined thickness (rough machining allowance, for example<br>
0.25 mm) is removed from main bearing HL. Immediately thereafter,<br>
or in other words without reclamping of the shaft, once the<br>
bearing has been gauged after rough cutting, inner layer 24<br>
(finish machining allowance, for example 0.1 mm) is removed by<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
19<br>
precision cutting, during which crankshaft 1 is rotated once<br>
again in direction of rotation 20 and milling finger 12 is<br>
rotated in direction of rotation 21. Reversal of directions of<br>
rotation 20 and 21 for precision cutting is not provided, but is<br>
entirely possible. During precision cutting, crankshaft 1<br>
performs somewhat more than one complete revolution. Together<br>
with the range of angle of rotation for immersion of the tool at<br>
the beginning of the precision cutting stage of rotary milling<br>
machining, the tool is engaged here over an angular interval of<br>
approximately 420°.<br>
By means of a vector diagram, Fig. 5a illustrates the relative<br>
feed during immersion (dashed) of milling finger 12 in the<br>
material, or in other words during the lead-in cut, during<br>
rotation (solid) and during exit (dot-dash) of the milling<br>
finger. Because of the geometric relationships (eccentricity e,<br>
bearing diameter, diameter of the milling cutter, cutter<br>
geometry, etc.), no purely tangential relative feed takes place<br>
during rotation; instead, a radial component 36 - illustrated in<br>
exaggerated size - is superposed on tangential component 35,<br>
resulting in relative feed 37 illustrated in vector form during<br>
rotation. During the lead-in cut, infeed movement 38 of milling<br>
cutter 12 along its longitudinal axis (in X direction) is added<br>
thereto. The relative feed resulting from superposition with<br>
vector 37 during the lead-in cut is illustrated by the<br>
corresponding lead-in cut or immersion vector 39. During exit of<br>
the milling cutter after complete revolution of the shaft, infeed<br>
movement 40 - which takes place in X direction - of milling<br>
cutter 12 is added to relative feed 37. The relative feed<br>
resulting from superposition with vector 37 during exit of the<br>
milling cutter is illustrated by the corresponding exit vector<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
20<br>
41. The respective size of infeed movements 38 and 40 is<br>
determined experimentally in advance. At that time, the direction<br>
of rotation of the shaft either in or opposite to the direction<br>
of offset of the milling cutter axis relative to the shaft axis<br>
must be taken into consideration. As reference point for<br>
determination of the order of magnitude of the infeed speed as a<br>
function of the other machining parameters as well as of the<br>
geometric relationships, there can be used the fact that the<br>
lead-in cut preferably extends over an angular interval of 3° to<br>
15° of rotation of the shaft.<br>
As already mentioned, crankshaft 1 is braced by one or two<br>
steadies (not illustrated) of the machine tool during multi-stage<br>
rotary milling machining of a main bearing HL. Bracing is<br>
provided primarily in the X direction, which is illustrated in<br>
vertical direction in Fig. 6. A sliding block 25, which is<br>
movable in both directions 26 along the X axis, is used for<br>
bracing. In addition to bracing in the X direction by sliding<br>
block 25, additional bracing is provided by two further sliding<br>
blocks 27 and 28, which can be moved respectively in radial<br>
directions 29 toward and back away from main bearing seat HL of<br>
crankshaft 1. A mechanism (not illustrated) of the steady<br>
coordinates the three movements 26 and 29 in such a way that<br>
sliding blocks 27 and 28 move onto main bearing HL, while sliding<br>
block 25 moves downward in the direction of double arrow 26.<br>
Conversely, sliding blocks 27 and 28 move away from main bearing<br>
HL in the direction of double arrows 29, while sliding block 25<br>
moves upward in the direction of double arrow 26. A mechanism<br>
that is known in itself and that does not have to be further<br>
described here provides for coordination of movements 26 and 29.<br><br>
WO 2006/056460	PCT/EP2005/012634<br>
21<br>
However, bearing seat 30 of main bearing HL is also interrupted<br>
by an oil bore 31. Disturbances can be caused by the rim of this<br>
oil bore 31, and they appear during rotation of crankshaft 1,<br>
while main bearing HL is being braced by sliding blocks 25, 27<br>
and 28. To avoid such disturbances, sliding blocks 25, 27 and 28<br>
are each provided with a groove 32. The effect of groove 32 is<br>
that the bracing portion 33 of the total supporting face of<br>
sliding blocks 25, 27 and 28 is smaller than their respective<br>
cross-sectional face turned toward main bearing HL during<br>
bracing. What is not illustrated in the drawing is the possible<br>
adaptation of the sliding blocks to the generating line of the<br>
bearing seat to be manufactured by means of hollow grinding (see<br>
hereinabove).<br><br>
