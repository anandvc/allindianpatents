The present invention relates to benzothiophenecarboxamide derivatives, the intermediates therefor, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, PGD2 (prostaglandin D2) antagonists comprising them, and drugs for treating nasal blockage comprising them.<br><br>
Some of bicyclic amide derivatives analogues to the compounds of the present invention have been described that they are useful as thromboxane A2 (TXA2) antagonists (Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 53295/1991). However, in the Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 53295/1991, it has only been described that the compounds are useful as TXA2 antagonists, but there is no suggestion of the usefulness thereof as PGD2 antagonists as found in the present invention.    On the other hand, in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No.79060/1993, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No.23170/1994 and Chem. Pharm. Bull. Vol.37, N0.6 1524-1533 (1989), it has been described bicyclic amide derivatives, which are intermediates for bicyclic sulfonamide derivatives.    However, the compounds disclosed therein are different from those of the present invention in the species of substituents at the amide portion.    And some of the compounds analogues to the<br><br>
compounds of the present invention has been described that they are useful as PGD2 antagonists in WO 97/00853.    However, there is no suggestion that the compounds disclosed in WO 97/00853 possess a inhibitory activity against infiltration of eosionophils.<br>
TXA2 has been known to have various activities such as platelet aggregation, thrombogenesis, etc.    The TXA2 antagonists have therefore been considered to be useful as anti-thrombotic agents as well as drugs    in the treatment of myocardial infarction or asthma.<br>
On the other hand, the PGD2 antagonists of the present invention are useful in the improvement of conditions due to excessive production of PGD2, particularly as drugs for treating diseases in which mast cell dysfunction is involved, for example, systemic mastocytosis and disorder of systemic mast cell activation as well as for tracheal contraction, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria, ischemic reperfusion injury, inflammation, and atopic dermatitis.<br>
PGD2 is a major prostanoid that is produced in and released from mast cells in which it is produced through PGG2 and PGH2 from arachidonic acid by the action of cyclooxygenase activated by immunological or unimmunological stimulation.    PGD2 has various potent physiological and pathological activities. For example, PGD2 can cause strong tracheal contraction to lead to bronchial asthma, and in a systemic allergic state, it dilates the peripheral vessels to cause an anaphylactic shock.    Especially, much attention has been paid to the theory that PGD2 is one of the causal substances responsible to the onset of nasal blockage in the allergic rhinitis.    Therefore, it has been proposed to develop an<br><br>
inhibitor against the biosynthesis of PGD2 or an antagonist of PGD2 receptor as a drug for the reduction of nasal blockage.    However, the inhibitor of PGD2 biosynthesis possibly much affects the synthesis of prostaglandins in other parts of organisms, and therefore, it is desirable to develop an antagonist (blocker) specific to the PGD2 receptor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have studied intensively to develop PGD2 receptor antagonists (blockers) specific to the PGD2 receptor, and found that a series of compounds of the formula (I) below, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or hydrates thereof possess a potent activity as PGD2 receptor antagonists and a inhibitory activity against infiltration of eosionophils, and are useful as drugs for treating nasal blockage.

These carboxylic acids may have the substituents as defined above.<br>
These carboxylic acids can be prepared in accordance with methods as described in Nippon Kagaku Zasshi Vo.l 88, No. 7, 758-763 (1967), Nippon Kagaku Zasshi Vol. 86, No. 10, 1067-1072 (1965), J. Chem. Soc (c) 1899-1905 (1967), J. Heterocycle. Chem. Vol. 10 679-681 (1973), J. Heterocyclic Chem. Vol 19 1131-1136 (1982) and J. Med. Chem. Vol. 29 1637-1643 (1986).<br>
The reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula (III) means the corresponding acid halide (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide), acid anhydride (e.g., mixed acid anhydride with formic acid or acetic acid), active ester (e.g., succinimide ester), and the like, and can generally be defined as acylating agents used for the acylation of amino group.    For example, when an acid<br><br>
halide is employed, the compound (III) is reacted with a thionyl halide (e.g., thionyl chloride), phosphorous halide (e.g., phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentachloride), oxalyl halide (e.g., oxalyl chloride), and the like, in accordance with known methods as described in the literatures (e.g., Shin-Jikken-Kagaku-Koza, Vol. 14, 1787 (1978); Synthesis 852-854 (1986); Shin-Jikken-Kagaku-Koza Vol. 22, 115 (1992)).<br>
The reaction can be conducted under a condition generally used for the acylation of amino group.    For example, in the case of condensation with the acid halide, the reaction is carried out in a solvent such as an ether solvent (e.g., diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane), benzene solvent (e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated solvent (e.g., dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform) as well as ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and those aqueous solvents, or the like, if necessary, in the presence of a base ( e.g., organic base such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, N-methylmorpholine; inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,potassium carbonate, or the like) under cooling at room temperature or under heating, preferably at a temperature ranging from -20 "C  to ice-cooling temperature, or from room temperature to a refluxing temperature of the reaction system, for a period of several min to several hr, preferably for 0.5 hr to 24 hr, particularly, for 1 hr to 12 hr.    In the case of using the carboxylic acid in a free form without converting into the reactive derivatives, the reaction is conducted in the presence of a condensing agent (e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-ethyl-3-(3-methylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole) usually used<br><br><br>
In this step, a compound of the formula (V) can be prepared by reacting an amino compound of the formula (IV) with the carboxylic acid of the formula (III) or its reactive derivative, this step can be prepared in accordance with the same process as process 1.    Some of the amino compound of the formula (IV) is described that the process is disclosed in Chem. Pharm. Bull. Vol. 37, No. 6, 1524-1533 (1989). (Step 2)<br>
In this step, the compound of the formula (V) is oxidized into the aldehyde compound of the formula (VI).    This step may be carried out with chromated oxidizing agents such as Jones' reagent, Collins' reagent,<br><br>
pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate in a solvent such as chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g., chloroform, dichloromethane), ether (e.g., ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran), or acetone, benzene, and the like under cooling or at room temperature for several hours.    This step may be also carried out with oxidizing agents in the combination of appropriate activator agents (e.g., trifluoroacetic anhydride, oxalyl chloride) and dimethyl sulfoxide, if necessary, in the presence of base (e.g., organic base such as triethylamine, diethylamine). (Step 3)<br>
In this step, the  a -chain of the aldehyde compound of the formula (VI) is conducted into the compound of the formula (I).    In this step, the compound of the formula (I) can be prepared by reacting the aldehyde compound of the formula (VI) with an ylide compound corresponding to the rest part of the   a -chain in accordance with conditions of the Wittig reaction. Further, the ylide compound corresponding to the rest part of the a -chain can be synthesized by reacting triphenylphosphine with a corresponding halogenated alkanoic acid or ester derivative thereof in the presence of a base according to a known method.<br>
In the reaction of the other reactive derivatives or free acid with the amine (II) or (IV), according to the property of each reactive derivatives or free acid, in accordance with a known method, the reaction conditions are determined.    The reaction product can be purified in accordance with a conventional purification, such as the extraction with a solvent, chromatography, recrystallization, and the like.<br><br>
The objective compound (I) in the present invention can be converted into a corresponding ester derivative, if desired.    For example, the ester can be prepared by esterification the carboxylic acid in accordance with a known method.    If desired, E isomer, Z isomer or the mixtures can be produced depending on the reaction conditions.<br>
When using a compound (I) of the present invention in treatment, it can be formulated into ordinary formulations for oral and parenteral administration. A pharmaceutical composition containing a compound (I) of the present invention can be in the form for oral and parenteral administration. Specifically, it can be    formulated into formulations for oral administration such as tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrup, and the like; those for parenteral administration such as injectable solution or suspension for intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, inhalant, eye drops, nasal drops, suppositories, or percutaneous formulations such as ointment.<br>
In preparing the formulations, carriers, excipients, solvents, and bases known to one ordinary skilled in the art may be used.    In case of tablets, they are prepared by compressing or fomulating an active ingredient together with auxiliary components.    Examples of usable auxiliary components include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binders (e.g., cornstarch), fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose), disintegrants (e.g., starch sodium glycolate) or lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate). Tablets may be coated appropriately.    In the case of liquid formulations such as syrups, solutions, or suspensions, they may contain suspending agents (e.g., methyl cellulose), emulsifiers (e.g., lecithin), preservatives and the like.    In the case of injectable<br><br>
formulations, it may be in the form of solution or suspension,    or oily or aqueous emulsion, which may contain suspension-stabilizing agent or dispensing agent, and the like.    In the case of an inhalant, it is formulated into a liquid formulation applicable to an inhaler.    In the case of eye drops, it is formulated into a solution or a suspension.    Especially, in the case of nasal drug for treating nasal blockage, it can be used as a solution or suspension prepared by a conventional formulating method, or as a powder formulated using a powdering agent (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbopole), which are administered into the nasal cavity.    Alternatively, it can be used as an aerosol after filling into a special container together with a solvent of low boiling point.<br>

The compounds prepared in Examples above were tested for determining the in vivo and in vitro activities according to the method as shown in Experimental examples below. Experiment 1 Binding to PGD2 Receptor Materials and Methods<br>
(1)	Preparation of Human Platelet Membrane Fraction<br>
Blood sample was obtained using a plastic syringe containing 3.8 % sodium citrate from the vein of healthy volunteers (adult male and female), put into a plastic test tube and mixed gently by rotation.    The sample was then centrifuged at 1800 rpm, 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant containing PRP (platelet-rich plasma) was    collected.    The PRP was re-centrifuged at 2300 rpm, 22 min at room temperature to obtain platelets.    The platelets were homogenized using a homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax) followed by centrifugation 3 times at 20,000 rpm, 10 min at 4*0  to obtain a platelet membrane fraction. After protein determination, the membrane fraction was adjusted to 2 mg/ml and preserved in a refrigerator at -SO^C  until use.<br>
(2)	Binding to PGD2 Receptor<br>
To a binding-reaction solution (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCb) (0.2 ml) were added the human platelet membrane fraction (0.1 mg) and 5 nM [3HJPGD2 (115Ci/mmol), and reacted at 4*0  for 90 min.    After the reaction completed, the reaction mixture was filtered through a glass fiber filter paper, washed several times with cooled saline, and measured the radioactivity retained on the filter paper.    The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding (the binding in the presence of 10  M M PGD2) from the<br><br>
total binding.    The inhibitory activity of each compound was expressed as the concentration required for 50 % inhibition (ICso), which was determined by depicting a substitution curve by plotting the binding ratio (%) in the presence of each compound, where the binding ratio in the absence of a test compound is 100 %.    The results are shown in Table 15.<br><br>
Experiment 2    Evaluation of Antagonistic Activity Against PGD2 Receptor Using Human Platelet<br>
Peripheral blood was obtained from a healthy volunteer using a syringe in which 1/9 volume of citric acid/dextrose solution has been previously added. The syringe was subjected to centrifugation at 180 g for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (PRP: platelet rich plasma).    The resultant PRP was washed 3 times with a washing buffer and the number of platelet was counted with a micro cell counter.    A suspension adjusted to contain platelet at a final concentration<br>
Q<br>
of 5 X 10 /ml was warmed at ST'C, and then subjected to the pre-treatment with 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (0.5mM) for 5 min. To the suspension was added a test compound diluted at various concentration. Ten-minute later, the reaction was induced by the addition of 0.1 W M PGD2 and, 2-minute later, stopped by the addition of hydrochloric acid.    The platelet was destroyed with an ultrasonic<br><br>
homogenizer.    After centrifugation, the cAMP in the supernatant was determined by radioimmunoassay.    PGD2 receptor antagonism of a drug was evaluated as follows.    The inhibition rate regarding cAMP increased by the addition of PGD2 was determined at individual concentration, and then the concentration of the drug required for 50 % inhibition (IC50) was calculated. The results are shown in Table 16.<br><br>
Experiment 3   Experiment Using Nasal Blockage Model<br>
The method used for measuring the intranasal pressure for evaluating the anti-nasal blockage using guinea pigs is described below.<br>
A 1% ovalbumin (OVA) solution was treated with an ultrasonic nebulizer to obtain an aerosol. Hartley male guinea pig was sensitized by inhaling twice the aerosol for 10 min at one-week interval. Seven-day after the sensitization, the guinea pig was exposed to an antigen to initiate the reaction. Briefly, the trachea was incised under the anesthesia with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and cannulas were inserted into the trachea at the pulmonary and nasal cavity sides. The canal inserted at the pulmonary side was connected with an artificial respirator that provides 4 ml air 60 times/min. After arresting the spontaneous respiration of the guinea pig with Gallamin (2 mg/kg, i.v,), air was supplied to<br><br>
the snout side with an artificial respirator at the frequency of 70 times/min, and the flow rate of 4 ml air/time, and the atmospheric pressure required for the aeration was measured by the use of a transducer fitted at the branch.    The measurement was used as a parameter of the nasal cavity resistance.    The exposure of an antigen was carried out by generating aerosol of 3 % OVA solution for 3 min between the respirator and the nasal cavity cannula.    The test drug was administered orally 60 min before the antigen exposure.    The intranasal pressure between 0 to 30 min was measured continuously and the effect was expressed as an inhibition rate to that obtained for vehicle using the AUG for 30 min (on the vertical axis, intranasal pressure (cm H2O), and on the horizontal axis, time (0 - 30 min)) as an indication.    The result is shown in Table 17.<br>

Experiment 4   Activity on infiltration of eosionophils in the nasal cavity by an antigen challenge<br>
To a Hartley male guinea pig was injected intraperitoneally cyclophosphamide (30 mg/kg), after 2 day 1 ml of suspension containing 1 mg of ovalbumin (OVA) and 100 mg of aluminum hydroxide was injected intraperitoneally.    After 3 weeks, 1ml of mixture of OVA (10  H g) and aluminum hydroxide (100 mg) was intraperitoneally injected as additional immunization to sensitize systemically.    After the lapse of 3 weeks, local sensitization, each 10  M 1 of 1 % OVA solution was dripped in both nasal cavities four times at 2 - 4 day intervals.    After 5 - 7 days from the final sensitization.<br><br>
nasal antigen challenge was performed by dripping 10  /z 1 of 1 % OVA solution to the guinea pigs in the both nasal cavity.    Five hours after nasal challenge, the guinea pigs were exsanguinated under the anesthetization.    The nasal airways were washed by infusing 10 ml of saline, and the washings were collected.    The washings were centrifuged, the cell pellets were resuspended in 100  w 1 of saline, and the total cells were counted by the Tiirk stain.    Then smear samples were prepared, and the cells were classified after the May-Griinwald-Giemsa stain.    The eosinophil number was determined by multiplying the rate of eosinophils with the total cells.    A test compound (IA-a-5) was suspended in 0.5 % methyl cellulose, and administered orally at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, 1 hr before the antigen challenge.    The result is shown figure 1.<br>
