New oripavine derivatives and their uses as pharmaceuticals<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel oripavine derivatives, their non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and their uses in the preparation of<br>
analgesics or abstinence agents of opium habit-forming drugs.<br>
Background art<br>
The Great Britain patent 1136214 disclosed compounds represented by the<br>
following formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl, R2 is cyclopropyl methyl or allyl, R3 is<br>
alkyl, phenyl or phenyl alkyl. These compounds have potent central analgesic<br>
activity and opiate antagonist activity.<br>
Among them, buprenorphine (where R1 is hydrogen, R2 is cyclopropyl methyl,<br>
R3 is tert-butyl) has good analgesic activity and little dependence with<br>
potency 25-30 times as that of morphine and less dependence. It has now<br>
been widely used as analgesics and anti-addiction. But buprenorphine only<br>
have moderate efficacy (40% that of morphine) and low bioavailability. So it<br>
could not be administered orally.<br><br><br>
Buprenorphine<br>
U.S. patent 3931189 disclosed buprenorphine analogues wherein R2 is<br>
aromatic heterocyclic alkyl; Chinese patent CN1168377A disclosed<br>
buprenorphine analogues wherein R3 is cyclobutyl or cyclopropyl.<br>
Although the prior arts have given these teachings, it is still of great need for<br>
new drugs for the treatment of pain and addiction.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventor of the present invention has discovered that the oripavine<br>
derivatives represented by the formula (I) or their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts not only have strong analgesic potency and analgesic efficacy,<br>
but also exhibit good oral bioavailability, long acting time, low small animal<br>
body dependency. As a result, the invention has been completed.<br>
Therefore, the present invention at one aspect aims to provide novel oripavine<br>
derivatives represented by the formula (I) and their non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The present invention at another aspect relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising as active ingredient oripavine derivatives represented<br>
by the formula (I) and their non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
The present invention relates to oripavine derivatives represented by the<br>
formula (I):<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl, R2 is methyl, cyclopropyl methyl,<br>
cyclobutyl methyl or allyl, R3 is thiophenylethyl or cycloalkyl methyl where<br>
the cycloalkyl has 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and their non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are preferably selected from the compounds<br>
represented by the following formulae:<br><br><br><br>
or their non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The oripavine derivatives according to the present invention can be prepared<br>
by the following reaction schemes:<br><br><br>
Starting material thebaine (II) is reacted with methyl vinyl ketone by Diels-<br>
Alder reaction to obtain a compound of formula III with a yield of 80-90%;<br>
the resulting compound of formula III is hydrogenated in the presence of<br>
palladium catalyst to obtain a compound of formula IV, the resulting<br>
compound of formula IV is reacted thiophenylethyl bromide by Grignard<br>
addition reaction to obtain a compound of formula V; the compound of<br>
formula V is reacted with cyanobromide to give the compound of formula VI<br>
substituted by N-cyano group, the compound of formula VI is hydrolyzed<br>
with potassium hydroxide to obtain a compound of formula VII, which is a<br>
key intermediate. Finally the compound of formula VII is subjected alkylation<br>
reaction on nitrogen atom to yield the target compound.<br>
The compounds of the invention wherein R3 is cycloalkyl methyl where the<br>
cycloalkyl has 3 to 6 carbon atoms can be prepared by the following schemes:<br><br><br><br>
the intermediate of formula VI obtained according to the first scheme is<br>
reacted with cyanobromide to obtain a compound of formula V substituted<br>
by N-cyano group, the resulting compound of formula V is hydrolyzed with<br>
potassium hydroxide to obtain a compound of VI'; the resulting compound of<br>
formula VI' is reacted with cyclopropyl methyl bromide to obtain an<br>
intermediate of formula VII'; the intermediate of formula VIP is subjected to<br>
Grignard addition reaction and then demethoxylated to yield target compound<br>
of formula I.<br>
When a compound has sufficient acidic strength or basic capability to form a<br>
stable a nontoxic acidic or basic salt, it is appropriate that the compound is<br>
administered in the form of a salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts are organic addition salts formed with acids, these acids form<br>
physiologically acceptable anions, such as tosylates, methyl sulfonates,<br><br>
acetates, citrates, malonates, tartrates, succinates, benzoates, ascorbates,<br>
alpjha-keto-glutaric acid salts, maleates, fumarates, benzenesulfonates, and<br>
alpha-glycerin phosphates. These acids also form suitable inorganic salts,<br>
including hydrobromides, hydrochlorides, sulfates, nitrates, bicarbonates and<br>
carbonates.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be obtained by common methods<br>
in the art, for example, a physiologically acceptable anion can be formed by<br>
reacting a compound with sufficient basic strength such as an amine with a<br>
suitable acid.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be administered in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and appropriate<br>
carriers. These pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by various<br>
processes and contain common carriers in the art. The guidelines for these<br>
processes and components have been taught in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, edited by E.W. Martin (Mark Publ. Co., 15th Ed., 1975 ). For the<br>
necessity for the completeness of the invention, the reference document is<br>
introduced for reference. The compounds and the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions according to the invention can be administered non-<br>
enterogastrically (such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly),<br>
locally, transdermally, orally or rectally.<br>

Experiment of Pharmacological Activity Evaluation<br>
Pharmacological effect of the compounds according to the invention was<br>
measured by the methods of acetic acid writhing test, 55°C hot plate test, rat<br>
55 °Chot water bath test and so on.<br>
1.Antinociceptive tests<br>
1.1. Methods<br>
(1) mice 55 °C hot plate test (sc/po)<br>
15<br><br>
Female mice weighing 18 - 22 g were used in the test. The latency was<br>
measured as the period from placing the animals on the 55°C plate to the<br>
appearance of response to the hot nociceptive stimulus (licking hindpaws,<br>
jumping and flicking of paws) before and after administration of drugs (sc/po),<br>
respectively. Each group had 8 mice. The cut off time was 60 sec. The results<br>
were expressed as possible maximal analgesic percentage (PMAP),<br>
 Latency after ad ministration - Latency before administration <br>
PMAP =	—	—	x 100<br>
60-Latency before administration<br>
ED50 was calculated with Logit program.<br>
(2)	Rat hot water bath test<br>
Male and female (1:1) Wistar rats weighing 180 - 200 g were used. The<br>
latency was defined as a period from insertion of the tip part of the rat tail into<br>
55°C hot water to withdrawal of tail from it before and after administration of<br>
drugs, respectively. Each group had 8 mice. The results were expressed as<br>
PMAP and the computational method was same as that as mentioned above.<br>
The longest latency was defined as 15 s. And then ED50 was calculated with<br>
Logit program.<br>
(3)	Acetic acid writhing test<br>
Male and female (1:1) mice weighing 18 - 22 g were used. Acetic acid<br>
(0.6 %, 0.4 ml per mouse, ip) was administered to each animal. 5 min later,<br>
the frequency of writhing in the following 15 min was counted. The drugs or<br>
normal saline were administrated by sc 30 min and by po 60 min prior to<br>
injection of acetic acid, respectively. ED50 was calculated with Logit program.<br>
writhing number in normal saline - writhing number in drug<br>
analgesic percentage =	x l00<br>
writhing number in normal saline<br><br><br>
In the mice hot plate test, analgesic dose-response curves of compound<br>
of compound I1 was familiar with that of buprenorphine, Max. efficacy of<br>
which was less than 100%, which produced a dose-dependent partial agonist<br>
properties. Efficacy of compound of compound I1 was stronger than that of<br>
buprenorphine, especially in serious analgesic models.<br>
In the mice acetic acid writhing test, the Max. analgesic efficacy of<br>
compound I1 reached 100% while that of buprenorphine was 92.5%. In the<br>
hot plate test, the Max. analgesic efficacy of compound I1 was 81.7% while<br>
that of buprenorphine was 40.3%(Tab 1). In rat 55"Chot water bath test and<br>
rat formaldehyde test, efficacy and potency of compound I1 was stronger than<br>
that of buprenorphine (Tab 2). In the rhesus monkey tail flick test, the latency<br>
of tail flick was prolonged along with increasing of dose when given<br>
compound I1 16-µg-kg'1 im or 6-24|µg-kg"1 po, but the effects of the latter<br>
was weaker than that of former (Tab 4). From above results, compound I1<br>
showed preferable antinociceptive activity.<br><br><br>
In the mice hot plate test, efficacy and potency of compound I5-17 was<br>
stronger than that of buprenorphine, Max. analgesic efficacy of which were<br>
less than 100%, producing a dose-dependent partial agonist properties.<br><br>
In mice hot plate test, analgesic effects of the compound I1<br>
administerted by po and sc, was compared (see figure 1). The ED50 value po<br>
was 2.5 times of that of sc, but the Max. efficacy of them was almost identical.<br>
In the same test, the ED50 value of buprenorphine po was 12.4 times of that of<br>
sc. In other analgesic models, the ratio of ED50 value po/ ED50 value sc of<br>
compound I1 was less than that of buprenorphine (Tab 4 ). The above results<br><br>
indicated that bioavailability of compound I1 was higher than that of<br>
buprenorphine, the range of effective dose of compound I1 was l-3mg-kg-1in<br>
two analgesic models.<br>
2. Physical dependent test<br>
2.1.	Methods and animals<br>
Male Swiss mice, weighing 18 - 22 g, pretreated with morphine (24<br>
mg-kg"1, s.c.) or buprenorphine (3.6 mg-kg"1, s.c.) or compound I1 (5.0 mg-kg"1,<br>
s.c.) respectively 3 times daily for 14d, naloxone(10 mg-kg"1, i.p.) was<br>
injected 4 h after the last administration of drugs, The number of jumping was<br>
immediately observed within a period of 15 min and loss of body weight were<br>
marked 60 min after administration of naloxone.<br>
Wister rats, male, weighing 180 - 200 g, were used. Morphine,<br>
buprenorphine and compound I1 were administrated as mentioned above. 4 h<br>
after the last administration of drugs, all subjects were injected naloxone(5<br>
mg-kg"1 s.c). The frequency of gasps, ptosis, shakes, teeth chatter and yawns<br>
was immediately observed for 15 min after injection of naloxone. The total<br>
score for abstinence signs was calculated as the sum of the scores for all<br>
individual signs of the withdrawal reaction. Loss of body weight was<br>
recorded for 60 min after injection of naloxone.<br>
2.2.	Results<br>
There was a significant increase in the number of total abstinence signs<br>
in morphine-treated group (30xTid x 7d, 30xTidxl4d) compared with saline<br>
group. Statistical evaluation of these data showed no significant differences in<br>
the number of abstinence syndrome in compound 11 -treated mice compared<br>
with saline group. These data indicated that compound I1has low potency of<br>
dependence.<br><br><br>
2. Psychological dependence experiment<br>
(1) Conditioned Place Preference testing in mice<br>
Swiss mice, male, weighted 18-22g. Animals were immediately<br>
confined for 40 min to one compartment after injection of compound I1, and<br>
to the other compartment after injection of saline. Animals that had been<br>
injected with drugs were confined to one of the end compartments A.M, and<br><br>
to the other of the end compartments after the injection of saline P.M. This<br>
tendentious conditioning cycle was performed for 5d. On day 6, preference<br>
state, after placing the animals in the neutral middle compartment and<br>
allowing them free access to each compartment. The time spent in drug-<br>
paired compartment was measured.<br>
The results are shown in Table 7. As seen in Table 7, morphine (10<br>
mg-kg-1) and buprenorphine (0.3 mg-kg-1) and compound I1(3 and 10 mg-kg-1)<br>
induced significant Conditioned Place Preference.<br><br><br><br>
(2) Self-administration testing<br>
The subjects were male Wistar rats, 350-400g and rhesus monkey, 4-6<br>
kg at the start of the experiments. Anesthesia was induced by administration<br>
of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg-kg-1, i.p). While anesthetized, rats were<br>
implanted with guide cannulas, one end of guide cannulas was implanted<br>
right atrium, and the other end was connected with self-administration<br>
installation. Penicillin G was administered immediately after surgery.<br>
Self-administration sessions were began 3 days after surgery. Rats were<br>
trained to self-administration compound I1 at a dose of 0.1 mg-kg-1 infusion on<br>
FR1 schedule. Daily sessions were 6 h. In duration, the number of infusions<br>
was recorded, while animals were deprived food.<br>
The results indicated that compound I-1 (0.05, 0.08, 0.1 mg-kg"1) couldn't<br>
induce self-administration in rat in continuous 35-40 days session (daily<br>
injections 
induce self-administration. Compound I1(0.025-0.05 mg-kg-1 /inject) couldn't<br>
induce the development of self-administration in rhesus monkey. These data<br>
indicate that the potency of dependence of compound I1is weak.<br>
3. Substitution test<br><br>
(1)	Methods and animals<br>
Methods and animals were as similar to self-administration test. Heroin<br>
was substituted by compound L1 after development of stable self-<br>
administration induced by heroin in rat. Step number and rating was recorded.<br>
Stable self-administration was developed by morphine (0.25 mg-kg"<br>
Vinject) in rhesus monkey. Compound I1 (0.025 mg-kg'Vinject), morphine<br>
(0.25 mg-kg"1 mg-kg'Vinject), buprenorphine (0.05 mg-kg'Vinject), morphine<br>
(0.25 mg-kg'Vinject) and compound I1 (0.05 mg-kg'Vinject) was substituted<br>
by turns.<br>
(2)	Results<br>
Self-administration could continue induced by compound I1 in heroin<br>
dependent rat. There were not increases of step number of 3 rats, but<br>
increased in other 3 rats. Step numbers were decreased in most of rat<br>
compared with the treatment of heroin.<br>
Compound I1 (0.025 mg-kg'Vinject) could continue self-administration in the<br>
place of morphine (0.25 mg/kg/inject), so did buprenorphine. Compound I1<br>
(0.05 mg-kg'Vinject) could not maintain this test in replace of morphine (0.25<br>
mg-kg'Vinject) or buprenorphine (0.05 mg-kg'Vinject). Results inferred that<br>
compound I1 had potency of addict, was as similar as buprenorphine, and was<br>
weaker than morphine.<br>
4. Na+ index Determination<br>
(1) Methods<br>
The subjects were male wistar rats, weighing 180 - 200 g. Rats were<br>
sacrificed by decapitation. The brain of rats without cerebellum was used to<br>
make membrane preparation containing opiate receptors. The brain was<br>
homogenized in 50 mmol-L-1tris-HCL solutions and centrifuged (20,000<br>
rev/min, 20 min). This procedure was repeated twice more. Each assay<br>
contained 0.5 mg membrane protein, 5 nmol • L-1 3H-naloxone and different<br>
concentrations of drugs ( 1 - 100000 nmol • L-1). Nonspecific binding was<br><br>
determined in the presence of 10 (imol • L-1 naloxone. The IC50 was<br>
calculated with Logit method. The Na+ index was determined by the ratio of<br>
the IC50 in the presence of 100 nmol • L-1NaCl to those in absence of it.<br>
(2) Results<br>
Compound I1 could inhibit 3H-naloxone binding with opiate receptors as<br>
similar to morphine and buprenorphine. The affinity of formula I1 to opiate<br>
receptors was higher 100 times than that of morphine. Na+ index is 0.42,<br>
which is character of typical antagonist.<br><br>
