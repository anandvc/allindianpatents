				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing a penicillanic acid compound. The penicillanic acid compound obtained by the present process is useful, for example, as an intermediate for ß-lactamase inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Processes are known for preparing a penicillanic acid compound of the formula (2) from a halogenated penicillanic acid compound of the formula (1), by catalytic reduction with use of a noble metal catalyst, by reaction with organic tin hydride compound, by reaction with zinc, by electrolytic reduction method, by reaction with aluminum and a catalytic amount of metal lead or lead compound (for example, patent literatures 1 to 4, non-patent literatures 1 to 2).<br>

The catalytic reduction with use of a noble metal catalyst requires a large amount of an expensive noble metal catalyst and demands application of dangerous hydrogen pressure, therefore the method is not practical. The organic tin hydride compound is a reagent which is difficult to be used industrially and the organic tin compound is harmful. The process using zinc affords the desired product which is low in yield and purity. The electrolytic reduction requires special apparatus and has problems for industrial operation. Further, it is considered that the use of lead is preferably restricted from the viewpoint of environmental care.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a process for preparing a penicillanic acid compound of the formula (2) which is free of industrial problems, safe, simple in procedures and industrially advantageous.<br>

In the present invention, it is possible to obtain a dehalogenated penicillanic acid compound in high purity and high yield from 6-halogenated penicillanic acid compound, (a) in the presence of a metal bismuth or bismuth compound, (b) using a metal having a lower standard oxidation-reduction potential than bismuth.<br>
In the present specification, examples of halogen atom are fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom.<br>
Any known carboxylic acid protecting groups are usable.  The groups disclosed in Theodora W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Chap. 5 are widely usable. Preferred examples thereof are benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, diphenylmethyl, trimethoxybenzyl, tert-butyl, methoxyethoxymethyl, piperonyl, ditolylmethyl, trimethoxy-dichlorobenzyl, trichloromethyl and bis(p-methoxyphenyl)methyl.<br>
In the present invention, it is possible to prepare a dehalogenated penicillanic acid compound by reacting a halogenated penicillanic acid compound of the formula (1), in the presence of a metal bismuth or bismuth compound, with a metal having a lower standard oxidation-reduction potential than bismuth.<br>
The reaction is considered to proceed as the following reaction scheme-1. (Reaction scheme 1)<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (Xa and Ya are a halogen atom, R is carboxylic acid protecting group, n is an integer of 0 to 2,)<br>

cycloheptane and cyclooctane, amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, etc.  These organic solvents are used singly or in admixture of at least two of them.

The reaction promoter or reaction auxiliary agent is used preferably in the form of an aqueous solution having a concentration of more than 0.1 %. The reaction proceeds smoothly by use of the reaction promoter or reaction auxiliary agent. Although the reason why the reaction is promoted is not clearly explained, it is considered that the promoter or agent can render an active species derived from aluminum, iron, magnesium or like metal and/or bismuth stable electrochemically.<br>
The reaction is conducted usually at about 0 °C to 100 "C, preferably about 10 °C to 50 °C, although suitably selected depending on the starting material or solvent, etc. The reaction is conducted usually for about 1 to 24 hours, preferably 3 to 12 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the desired penicillanic acid compound of the formula (2) can be isolated in almost pure state by a usual extraction procedure. When required, recrystallization, column chromatography or like widely used purification means can be applied.<br>
Further, in case of preparing and isolating the monohalogenated penicillanic acid compound of the formula (Ib) from the dihalogenated penicillanic acid compound of the formula (la), the reaction can be terminated after watching the reaction situation by HPLC, thin layer chromatography, NMR, etc., and confirming the amount of monohalogenated product. Usually, a mixture of the monohalogenated penicillanic acid compound of the formula (Ib) and the penicillanic acid compound of the formula (2) is obtained. These compounds can be isolated by liquid chromatography or like separating means.<br>
