				<td>Improved dipstick assays for testing for the presence of a target nucleic acid in a sample solution are described. A dipstick is provided which comprises a contact end for contacting the sample solution and a capture zone remote from the contact end for capturing target nucleic acid. Sample solution is contacted with the contact end to cause sample solution to move by capillary action to the capture zone. Target nucleic acid in the sample solution is captured at the capture zone and is detected by a plurality of different labelled detection probes each capable of hybridising to a different region of the target nucleic acid. The detection signal is thereby enhanced. In other methods a plurality of different capture probes are added to the sample solution which can then be bound by a capture moiety at the capture zone to indirectly capture target nucleic acid.

Inr^rcved Detection Sicr.al and Caot'j.re In Diostick Assavs<br>
The Dreser-t ir.vsntion relates to improved sensitivity cf nucleic acid detection by dipsticks. Dipsticks of the invention are iised to detect, the presence cf a target nucleic acid in a samole solution, for example to identify whether a patient is infected with a disease causing microorganism such as Chlamydia   trachomatis.<br>
Some conventional tests for detecting the presence of a target nucleic acid in a sample solution rely on amplification cf the target nucleic acid using the polymerase chain reaction (?CR). Whilst this reaction allows detection cf small quantities of target nucleic acid, it can take several hours before a result is obtained. This can be a significant disadvantage because it is often desired to obtain the result as soon as possible, for example, to keep patient waiting times to a minimum. Further disadvantages of such methods are the requirement for expensive specialise equipment to perform the reaction and the relatively high' cost of the reagents.<br>
In contrast, dipsticks can detect unamplified target nucleic acid without the requirement for any specialist equipment and the results can be obtained much more rapidly than ?C?.-based methods and, therefore, in a single visit from a , patient. The patient can then be treated in the same visit. This is particula.rly advantageous V7here the patient is unlikely to, or., cannot, return form treatment at a later<br>
date. The cost of performing a dipstick test can also be<br>
A'<br>
significantly lower than the cost of a PCR-based test.<br><br>
In a t'v-pical cor.ve-rional dipstick assay, described in US 5,310,65 0, a single stranded DNA capture probe is immobilised en a nitrccelluloss filter at a capture zone remote from one end of the filter (the contact end) . Part of the sequence cf the capture probe is complementary to the sequence cf a first region cf the target nucleic acid to be detected. A labelled single stranded DNA detection probe is immobilised on the nitrocellulose filter at a probe zone located between the capture zone and the contact end of the filter. The detection probe has sequence complementary to the sequence cf a second region (distinct from the first region) of the target nucleic acid.<br>
To detect single stranded target DNA in a sample solution thought to contain target DNA, the contact end of the nitrocellulose filter is contacted with the sainple solution. The sample solution wicks up the filter by capillary action and passes the probe zone and the capture zone. As the sample solution passes the probe zone, it mobilises the detection probe and causes it to rise with the sample solution towards the capture zone. Mobilised detection probe can then hybridise to the second region of any target DNA present in the sarrrole solution.<br>
When the hybridised detection probe and target DNA arrive at the capture zone, the first region of the target DNA can hybridise to the immobilised capture probe. A ternary coirrolex is thereby formed between the target nucleic acid, the capture probe and the labelled detection probe. Presence of label at the captizre zone, therefore, indicates that target DNA is present in the sample solution.<br><br>
lE^belled 1^1"--. dezecticn probe is not irrirriobilised on one —r 2, w !roo s" I-Oi - £ 5 z'i.lt.so.

The nitrocellulose filter is then contacted with the sample solution and any target nucleic acid v/nich is hybridised to the detection probe is captured at   the  capt^are  zone by  the  capture probe.<br>
It has been fcjnd, however, that the sensitivity'of nucleic acid detection by conventional dipsticks can be low, particularly if the target nucleic acid is double stranded. Consequently, the presence of target nucleic acid in a sample scluticn can sometimes be xindetected. Circular double stranded target nucleic acid is thought to be virtually -.undetectable _ using conventional dipstick tests. It is desired, therefore, to improve the sensitivity of target nucleic   acid detection by diosticks.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided 'cse of a pl^-urality of different detection probes in a dipstick assay for testing for the presence of a target nucleic acid on a samble solution, each detection orobe being capable of hybridising to a different region of the target nucleic acid, thereby allowing detection of the target  nucleic acid utilising the detection probe.<br>
The term ""dipstick assay" as used herein means any assay using a dipstick in which sairole solution is contacted with the dipstick to cause sarrole solution to move by capillary action   to  a  capture  zone  of  the  dipstick thereby allowing<br><br>
and detected =t  the  capture  zone.<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention there is also<br>
provided   a   kit    for   testing    for    the    presence   cf    target<br>
nucleic  acid in a  sainple solution which comprises:<br>
i)	a dipstick comprising:<br>
a chromatographic  strip having a  contact  end for contacting<br>
the sample solution;   and<br>
a  capture moiety  immobilised at   a   capture  zone remote  from<br>
the contact end,   the capture moiety being capable of binding<br>
directly or indirectly to the  target  nucleic acid;  and<br>
ii)      a plurality cf detection probes,   each detection probe<br>
being   capable   of   hybridising   to   a   different   region  of   the<br>
target   nucleic   acid  and  thereby   allowing  detection  of   the<br>
target nucleic acid utilising the   detection probes.<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention there is also<br>
provided a dipstick for testing   for  the presence cf  target<br>
nucleic acid in a  sample solution which comprises:    _<br>
a chromatographic  strip having a  contact  end for contacting<br>
the sample solution;<br>
a  capture moiety immobilised at   a   capture  zone remote  from<br>
the contact end,   the capture moiety being capable of binding<br>
directly or indirectly to the target nucleic acid;  and<br>
a plurality of detection probes releasably immobilised at a<br>
probe  zone of the chromatographic strip located between the<br>
contact end and the capture zone,   each detection probe being<br>
capable  of hybridising to a  different  region of  the  target<br>
nucleic    acid    thereby., allowing    detection   of    the    target<br>
nucleic acid utilising the detection probes.<br><br>
-crcoes, each detecticr. prrbe may comprise a label allowing direc" dstec^icr, cf "lie target nucleic acid utilising the detection probe, or each detection probe may comprise a ' detection ligand allov;ing indirect detection of the target nucleic acid utilising the detection probe. Each detection probe miay comprise a plurality of labels or a plurality of detection ligands.<br>
If the detection probe comprises a detection ligand, indirect detection of target nucleic acid utilising the detection probe can be achieved by use of a labelled detection ligand binding moiety. In some embodiments, the detection ligand binding moiety may be multiply labelled, for example a multiply labelled antibody capable of binding the  detection ligand.<br>
The term 'chron-iatographic strip' is used herein to mean any porous strip of material capable of transporting a solution by  capillarity.<br>
Dipsticks and kits of the first aspect of the invention may be used in methods for detecting target nucleic acid which are similar to those described above for the conventional dipstick assays. In those methods a capture p:jobe capable cf hybridising to the target nucleic acid is immobilised at the capture of the dipstick. However, there are a number of other arrangements by which the target nucleic acid can be captured to the capturre zone and which are within the scope cf  the  invention.<br>
A   capture   moiety   immobilised   at   the   capture   zone  may  be capable   of   binding   directly   or   indirectly   to   the   target .<br><br>
riucleic  acid  by  base  pairing  or  ncn  base  pairing interaction.<br>
For exairole, tbe capture moiety may comprise a capt^jre probe capahle cf hybridising directly to the target nucleic acid or to a hook captiire probe bound to the taxget nucleic acid. The hook capture probe comprises a first region capable of hybridising to the target nucleic .acid ajid a second region capable of hybridising to the capture probe. The hook capture probe can be added to the sample solution so that it can. bind to target nucleic acid in the sample solution and be captured by the capture probe as sample solution wicks up the dipstick" by capillary action.<br>
The capture moiety may alternatively be a capture liaand binding moiety capable of binding to a capture licand coupled to a capture probe bound to the target nucleic acid, thereby allowing indirect binding of the capture moiety to the target nucleic acid. For exarrrole the capture moiety may be an. antibody or an antibody fragment. In this axrangement, the capture probe may be added to the sample solution and hybridised to target nucleic acid in the sample solution before travelling up the dipstick by capillary action.<br>
The capture probe, the hook capture probe and the detection probe may each comprise at least one nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue. Where a probe comprises more than one nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue, they are preferably hybridised together.<br>

It will be appreciated that kits of the invention m^ay f^urther comprise any reagent required for the detection of target nucleic acid in a sample solution.<br>
Where appropriate, dipsticks and kits of the invention may be used in the following types of dipstick assay to test for the presence cf a target nucleic acid in a sample solution:<br>
1) A dipstick is provided which comprises a chxomiatogxaphic strip having a contact end and a captiire probe immobilised at a capture zone remote from the contact end, the capture probe being capable of hybridising to the target nucleic acid. A detection probe (or a plurality of different detection probes) is,-contacted with the sample solution under conditions for hybridisation of the detection probe (or probes) to the target nucleic acid. The sample solution is contacted with the contact end of tlie dipstick to cause ^"<br><br>
zor^e/ thereby ailDv:inr target nucleic acid aad the detecticr. probe (cr prcbes) ro move with the saniple solution to the capture ZOTI'Z:, and target nucleic acid to be capoured at the capture zone. Detection probe (or -Drobes) can then be detected for at the capture cone. The presence of detection probe (or probes) at the capture zone indicates that target nucleic acid was present in the sample solution.<br>
In a variation of this assay, the detection probe (or probes) rriay be releasably irrjnobilised to the dipstick between the contact end and the capture zone instead of being separate from the dipstick. When the contact end of the dipstick is contacted with the sample solution causing the sample solution to move by capillary action to the capture zone, the detection probe (or probes) is released into the sample solution so that released detection probe (or probes) can hybridise to target nucleic acid in the sample solution as it moves to the capture zone.<br>
In f-'urther variations of this assay, the detection probe (or probes) may be separate from the sample solution and contacted with the capt'ure cone of the dipstick. This vrill usually be done after the contact end of the dipstick has been contacted with the sample solution. The detection probe (or probes) may be contacted directly with the capture zone, or the detection probe (or probes) may be in a separate probe solution which is contacted with the contact end of the dipstick to cause the probe solution to move hy capillary action to the capture zone.<br>
2) A dipstick is provided which comprises a chromotographic strip having a contact end and a capture moiety immobilised ■<br><br>
at a captiire zcne ren^.ore from the contact end, the capture<br>
moiety being capable cf binding a capture probe hybridised<br>
to the targec nucleic acid.   The capt'.ire probe (or a<br>
plurality cf different capture probes) is contacted with the<br>
:    sample solution under conditions for hybridisation of the<br>
capture probe (or probes) to the target nucleic acid.  The<br>
sample solution is contacted with the contact end of the<br>
dipstick to cause sample solution to move by capillary<br>
• action to the capture zone, thereby allowing target nucleic<br>
'    acid and the capture probe (or probes) to oiove with the<br>
sample solution to the capture zone,   and target nucleic acid<br>
to be captured at the capture zone by binding of the capt-ure<br>
moiety to the capture probe.  Target nucleic acid can then<br>
be detected' for at the capture zone.  Target nucleic acid<br>
may be detected using a detection probe (or probes) as<br>
described for assay (1).  The detection probe (or probes)<br>
may be added to the sample solution with the capture probe<br>
or separately from the capture probe  (in any order).<br>
Alternatively the detection probe  (or probes) may be<br>
releasably immobilised to the dipstick between the contact<br>
end and the capture zone, or may be contacted separately<br>
with the capture zone as described for assay (1) .<br>
In a variation of assay (2), the capture probe (or probes) instead cf being mdxed with the sample solution, may be releasably immobilised to the dipstick between the contact end -and the capture zone. When the contact end of the dipstick is contacted with the sanrole solution causing the sample solution to move by capillary action to the capture zone, the capture probe (or probes) is released into the sample solution so that released capture probe (or probes) is released into the sample solutioii so -that released captxixe probe (or probes) can hybridise to target nucleic "/<br><br>
probe (cr prcbes) v.-hicr. may be contacted. v.-ith the sancle solution; releasably immobilised to the dipstick between the contact end and the capture zone, cr contacted separately with the capture zone.<br>
In a further variation of assay (2), the capture probe (or<br>
probes) may be contacted with the capture zone before, (or<br>
exceptionally, at the same tim.e as) the sample solution<br>
reaches the capfore zone by capillary action. . This will<br>
allow the capture probe (or probes) to be bound by the<br>
capture moiety at the capture zone so that target nucleic<br>
acid may be captured.  The capt^ure probe (or probes) may be<br>
in a separate capture probe solution which is contacted<br>
separately with the capture zone by directly applying it to<br>
the capture zone,  or by contacting the capture probe<br>
•solution with the contact end of the dipstick to cause the<br>
capture probe (or probes) to move by capillary action to the<br>
capture zone.- Subsequent contact of the contact end of the<br>
dipstick with the sample solution will allow target nucleic<br>
acid reaching the capture zone by capillary action to be<br>
captured there. Again, target nucleic acid may be detected<br>
for using a detection probe  (or probes) which may be<br>
contacted with  the sample solution, releasably immobilised<br>
to the dipstick between the contact end and the capture<br>
zone, or contacted separately with the capture zone. As an<br>
alternative to use of a detection probe (or probes) in assay<br>
(2) , the target nucleic acid may be labelled directly in the<br>
sample solution, for, example by covalent attachment of a<br>
label to the 'target nucleic acid.  This may be achieved by<br>
contact of a precursor label with the satrple solution and ,<br>
incubation of the sample solution and precursor label vmder<br><br>
concii-t i.cr^3 z.c^ cov5.I.~n- E.titi2.ciimsn^ O'z tins 1 HJD-^" Z.O -3.x"~5" nucleic acid.<br>
The capture roiety cf assay (2) may be a universal capture probe capable cf hybridising to the capture probe, or the capture moiety rriay be capable of binding by non base pairing interaction to the capture probe. For example, when the capture probe comprises one or more capture ligands, the capture moiety is a capture ligand binding moiety.<br>
Where the dipstick assay uses more than one probe capable cf hybridising to the target nucleic acid it is preferred that all the probes are added to the sample solution and that hybridisation is carried out in a single step. This simplifies the assay, making it easier and quicker to perform. It has been found that the sensitivity cf detection of tairget nucleic acid using a one step hybridisation assay is about eq'j.al to the sensitivity cf detection when hybridisation is carried out in multiple steps. Multiple step hybridisation may be carried out by sequential hybridisation of the different probes to the target nucleic acid in the sample solution, or by contacting the dipstick with different solutions each containing a different probe.- Usually, the latter m.ethod of multiple step hybridisation will involve washing the dipstick between each contact with a different probe solution. Whilst there may be circumstances in which multiple step hybridisation is preferred, it will be appreciated that the simpler and quicker format of one step hybridisation will usually be preferred.<br>
It is most, preferred that the sample solution is of suitable composition to allow the hybridisation reactions to take :<br><br>
base pairing interacticr.s to take place (for £xa~ple betveen.<br>
a detection ligar.d and a detection ligand binding rr.oiety and<br>
betv;een a capt'jjre ligand and a capture ligand binding<br>
moiety) and transport a complex comprising target nucleic<br>
acid and one cr mere hybridised probes and (optionally)<br>
ligand binding moieties by capillary action up the dipstick.<br>
Using such a sample solution, it will be appreciated that<br>
the hybridisation reactions can then be carried out in a.<br>
single  step,  and  any  ligand-ligand  binding  mciety<br>
interactions can take place, before the sample solution is<br>
contacted directly with the contact end of the dipstick<br>
(without the need to first dilute or alter the sample<br>
solution) .  Ligand-ligand binding moiety interactions can<br>
additionally cr alternatively take place on the dipstick if<br>
desired as the sample solution travels to the captxire zone.<br>
Simple and rapid dipstick detection cf target nucleic acid<br>
is thereby facilitated.<br>
V?e have found that such results are achieved with sample solutions comprising a standard hybridisation buffer (such as SS?E buffer or Tris buffer) with salt, detergent and a blocking protein such as ESA or powdered rrdlk. Th^ sensitivity of detection of target nucleic acid using such assays has been found to be about equal to or better than that of other dipstick assays.<br>
Preferably the regions of the. target nucleic acid to which the capture probe (s) and detection probe (s) bind are at least 10 nucleotides anart-<br>
There is also provided according to the invention use of a dipstick or a kit of the invention for testing for the<br><br>
Preferably ::he career nucleic acid is Chlairydia tracho:riB.tis nucleic acid.<br>
There is also provided according to the invention a probe for detectin3 or capturing target nucleic acid which comprises a nucleic acid cr nucleic acid analogue capable of hybridising to the target nucleic acid^ wherein the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue is coupled to a plurality of labels allowing direct detection of the target nucleic acid when the probe has hybridised to the target nucleic acid, or wherein the nucleic acid "is coilpled to a plurality of ligands which can be bound by a ligand binding moiety to detect or capture the target nucleic acid ^h'^n the probe has hybridised to the target nucleic acid.<br>
In order to link the ligand or the label to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue it will sometimes be necessary to use a modifier comprisina a first reactive crouo ca-oable of reacting with the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue and a second reactive group capable of reacting with the ligand or label.<br>
For example, the first reactive group iriay comprise phosphoramidite which is capable of reacting with a hydroiyl group of the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue. If the ligand or label comprises a carboxyl group, the second reactive group may comprise a primary amino group. An example of a suitable modifier for linking a ligand cr label to a 5^-OH cr 3'i-OH of the nucleic acid or analogue is 6-(trifluoroacetylamino) hexyl- (2-cyanoethyl)- {N,N-diisopropyl) -phosphoramidite , (C6-TFA) . The chemical structTores of some other modifiers suitable to link a ligand<br><br>
ar.alow-ie are sh.ov.T- in Fig'^re 5. These modifiers further coTT.prise a third reacoive group (a protected OH group) to react with a phosphate group thereby en.abling nucleotides to be joined together by reaction with the phoshporarr.idite and prooecteo OH croups. Fi^g^ure 5 shows the chemical structures after reaction with biotin.<br>
Once the modifier has reacted with the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue and the ligand or label to link the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue to- the ligand or label, the reacted modifier is termed herein a 'linker'.<br>
For each label or ligand of the plurality of labels or ligands a linker may covalently couple the label or ligand to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue. A comb-like structure is thereby formed (see Figure 4).<br>
The plurality cf labels or ligands may be covalently coupled to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue by a branched linlier. A fork-like str^actvure is thereby formed (see Fig'ure 4) .<br>
The cr each linker preferably comprises a non-nucleotide,<br>
preferably polyethylene glycol.<br>
Preferably the ligand or label is coupled to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue by a spacer- In order -to link the ligand or the label to the sapcer it will sometimes be necessary to use a modifier comprising a first reactive group capable of reacting with the spacer and a second reactive group capable of reacting with the ligand or label. An example of a s\iitable modifier is C6-TFA.<br><br>
Once the modifier h=3 reacted v.'ith the spacer ar-d the lig=r-d<br>
cr label to lirJ-: the spacer to the ligar-d or label, the<br>
reacted modifier is terr^ed herein a 'linker'.<br>
Preferably  the  spaoer  comprises  a  nucleotide  cr<br>
hexaethyleneclyool phosphate,<br>
Preferably the label is a nonradioactive label.<br>

The following examples relate to detection of a DNA fragment of the cryptic plasrrdd of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) . CT is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted disease. CT infections can cause infertility and,- d^^ring pregnancy, can result .in spontaneous abortion, still birth or postpartum endometritis. In neonates, CT infection can cause blindness and chronic respiratory disease, ^^proximately 10% of infected, men and upto .70% of infected<br><br>
accurate diarr.csis cf CT infeccion is imocrtar.c so that early treacrie-c cf che disease can be initiated.<br>
In examples 1 and 3 to 5 below, a dipstick 10 is used to try to detect dcjible stranded CT target nucleic acid 12 in a sample solution 14. The dipstick 10 comprises a strip of nitrocellulose 16 having a contact end 18 for contacting the sample solution 14 and a capture probe 2 0 immobilised at a capture zone 22 of the nitrocellulose strip IG reirote from the contact end IS, An anti-biotin antibody-dye conjugate 24 is releasably immobilised at a conjugate zone 25 of the nitrocellulose strip located between the contact end 18 and the capture zone 22. The capture probe 20 is capable cf hybridising to a first sequence of one strand (the first strand) cf the target nucleic acid 12.<br>
A detecticn probe 23 (or detection probes) and a helper probe 30 (or helper probes) each capable of hy-bridising to distinct regions of the first strand cf the double stranded target nucleic acid 12 are then added-to the sample solution 14. The detection probe 23 comiprises a nucleic acid coupled to biotin (using methods well known to those of skill in the art) . The sample solution 14 containing the detection probe 2S and the helper probe 3 0 is then heated to a temperature sufficient to separate the complementary strands of the double stranded target nucleic acid 12 from each other- s-t least in the region of the first strand to which the detection probe 28 axid helper probe 3 0 bind/ and is then cooled to allow, hybriciisation of the detection probe 28 and the helper probe 3 0 to the first strand of the double stranded target nucleic acid. Hybridisation of the detection probe and helper probe to the first strand prevents the<br><br>
secozid   str=r-i frcT. ra-H.rj::ealinc to the first strand; a-<br>
least in "h= recion cf the first strand to v.hich the detection prche and the helper probe are bound.<br>
The contact er.d 13 of the dipstick 10 is then contacted with the sample soliition 14. The sample solution 14 and any target nucleic acid 12 hybridised to the detection probe 23 and the helper probe 3 0 moves up the dipstick 10 by capillary action. As the sample solution 14 passes the conjugate zone 2S, it mobilises the anti-biotin antibody-dye conjugate 24. H.eleased anti-biotin antibody-dye conjugate 24 can then bind to the biotin of the detection probe 23 hybridised to the target nucleic acid 12.<br>
Complex formed between the anti-biotin antibody-dye conjugate 24, the detection probe 28, the helper probe 30 and the target nucleic acid 12 then wicks up the dipstick 10 to the capture cone 22 where the target nucleic acid of the complex can hybridise to the immobilised capture probe 20. The helper probe 3 0 is thought to facilitate hybridisation of the target nucleic acid to the capture probe 20 on the dipstick.<br>
The capture probe 20 is immobilised at. the capture zone 22<br>
in such a way that it canjiot be mobilised by the sample<br>
solution 14 as it moves past the capture 2one 22.<br>
Consequently, the complex bound to the capture probe remains<br>
in the capture zone and can be detected by the presence of<br>
the dye' cf the anti-biotin antibody-dye conjugate at the<br>
capture zone.  •	If there is no CT target nucleic acid in the sample solution, the detection probe 28 cannot" be ^capt\ired at the •<br><br>
zone. If there is CT target nucleic acid in the sample<br>
solution, bui insufficient amo^Lints of the target: nucleic acid can be captured at the capture zone the presence of the target nucleic acid in the sample solution will not be detected.<br>
The capture of target nucleic acid described above is referred to as direct probe capture, la example 2 an. antibody capture technique is used. In this technique, an antibody is irnmobilised at the capture zone cf _the dipstick instead of the capture probe. The capture probe is coupled to a capture ligand (such as biotin) which can be bound by the antibody and is added to the sample solution with the helper and detection probes. The capture probe hybridises to the target nucleic acid at 'the same time as the helper and detection probes. The d'etection probe is coupled to dye particles,<br>
The contact end of the dipstick is contacted with the sample solution after the caoture, helper and detection probes have hybridised to the target nucleic acid. Complex containing the target nucleic acid, capture probe, helper probe and detection probe is then captiired at the capture zone by the antibody immobilised at the caoture zone. Presence of tarcet nucleic acid in the sample solution is detected by the presence cf the dye particle at the capture zone. Thus, hybridisation of the capture probe to" the tarcet occurs in the sample solution rather than on the dipstick.<br>
It   has heen   found that the sensitivity of detection of target nucleic acid can be reduced if the distance between-, the region cf the target nucleic acid to-which the capture<br><br>
r-vmc-ses  is  .ess *ir,c^zi    2€    "uclaotides.  Thus,  it  13<br>
least  2 5 . nuc lee tiles  and  preferably  at  least  2 30 nucleotides.<br>

Results and Discussion<br>
The results presented In the Table and Figure 7 showed that about 10* copies of Ct E3 could be detected with one step nucleic acid dipstick assay in less than an hour including the sarrrole preparation step.<br>
Although the so presented dipstick detection assay has a sensitivity of detection about equal to other samdwdch hybridisation assays it has the major advantages of soeed and simolicitv.<br>
A. sandwich hybridisation assay for detection of Ct disclosed in PCT WO 93/1322 for example, is a complex multi-component microtitre plate format assay, which coul dnot be accoirolished for less than 5 hours. This" assay is a multi-step assay, which requires a gradual addition of its conponents in a defined order with incubations and washing<br><br>
The nucleic acid dipstick assay subject of this inventior. could be dene in one step with no need of different steps f or addition of components and washings . This sandwich hybridisation assay does not require more than one solution conditions in order to render them advantageous for hybridisation and other affinity pair formations. The same solution conditions could serve a free migration of the components through the dipstick membrane as well.<br>
