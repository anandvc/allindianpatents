Some applications have been listed by docket numbers. These will be replaced when application numbers are known.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known that surfaces bond better using liquid adhesives if the surfaces are first roughened. Surface roughening increases the surface area available for bonding to the liquid adhesive, which significantly increases the adhesive bond strength.<br>
Typically, surface roughening is achieved by abrading either or both of the surfaces to be bonded. For example, simply abrading one of the surfaces with emery cloth can achieve significant improvements in adhesive strength when compared with non-abraded surfaces.<br>
However, when  bonding microscale substrates, such as semiconductor integrated circuits ("chips"), it is generally not desirable to abrade a surface of the substrate. Indeed, it is highly desirable for semiconductor chips to have very smooth surfeces. Any defects on the surface of the integrated circuit can result in crack propagation and significantly weaken the device. With a drive towards thinner and thinner integrated circuits (e.g. less than 200 micron ICs), there is a corresponding need to reduce surface roughness, in order to maintain acceptable mechanical strength in devices.<br>
With surface roughness being of primary importance, silicon wafers are typically thinned using a two-step process. After front-end processing of the wafer, the wafer is usually first thinned by backgrinding in a mechanical grinding tool. Examples of wafer grinding tools are the Strasbaugh 7AF and Disco DFG-841 tools. Mechanical grinding is a quick and inexpensive method of grinding silicon. However, it also leaves a back surface having a relatively high surface roughness (e.g. Rmax of about 150 nm). Moreover, mechanical grinding can result in defects (e.g. cracks or dislocations), which extend up to about 20 Î¼m into the back surface of the wafer.<br>
La terms of mechanical strength, surface roughness and surface defects are unacceptable in integrated circuits. Accordingly, back-end thinning is typically completed by a technique, which removes these defects and provides a low surface roughness. Plasma thinning is one method used for completing wafer thinning. Typically, plasma thinning is used to remove a final 20 Î¼m. of silicon to achieve a desired wafer thickness. Whilst plasma thinning is relatively slow, it results in an extremely smooth back surface with virtually no surfece defects. Typically, plasma thinning<br><br>
provides a maximum surface roughness (Rmax) of less than 1 nm. Hence, plasma thinning is a method of choice for back-end processing in integrated circuit fabrication<br>
Integrated circuits, such as KIEMS de\ices, often need to be bonded to other substrates. In the fabrication of the Applicant's MEMS printheads, for example, printhead integrated circuits bonded side-by-side onto a moulded ink manifoid to form a printhead assembly. (For a detailed description of the Applicant's printhead fabrication process, see the Detailed Description below and US Patent Application no. 10/728,970, the contents of which is incorporated herein by cross-reference).<br>
However, it will be appreciated that integrated circuits have contradictory requirements of their backside surfaces. On the one hand, the backside surfaces of integrated circuits should have a low surface roughness and be devoid of any cracks, in order to maximize their mechanical strength. This is especially important for thin (e.g. less than 250Î¼m integrated circuits). On the other hand, the backside surfaces of integrated circuits often need to be suitable for bonding to other substrates using adhesives or adhesive tape. As discussed above, adhesive strength is usually maximized by increasing the surface roughness of a surface to be bonded, thereby maximizing contact with the intermediate adhesive.<br>
It would be desirable to provide an improved method of bonding substrates using adhesives, which avoids increasing the surface roughness of the substrate. It would also be desirable to provide a thin  substrate (e.g.

(c)	bonding the first bonding surface and the second bonding surface together using an adhesive,<br>
wherein the adhesive is received, at least partially, in the plurality of etched trenches during bonding.<br><br>
In a second aspect, there is provided a first substrate suitable for bonding to a second substrate using an adhesive, said first substrate having a plurality of etched trenches defined in a first bonding surface, the etched trenches being configured for receiving the adhesive during bondiag.<br>
In a third aspect, there is provided a bonded assembly comprising:<br>
(a)	a first substrate having a plurality of etched trenches defined in a first bonding surface;<br>
(b)	a second substrate having a second bonding surface; and<br>
(c)	an adhesive bonding the first bonding surface and the second bonding surface together, whereiQ the adhesive is sandwiched between the first and second substrates, and is received in the plurahty of etched trenches.<br>
In a fourth aspect, there is provided a printhead assembly comprising:<br>
(a)	a plurality of printhead integrated circuits, each printhead integrated circuit<br>
comprising:<br>
a plurality of nozzles formed on a firontside of the printhead integrated circuit; a plurality of ink supply channels for supplying ink from a backside of the printhead integrated circuit to the nozzles; and<br>
a plurality of etched trenches defined in the backside; and<br>
(b)	an ink manifold having a mounting surface, the backside of each printhead<br>
integrated circuit being bonded to the mounting surface with an adhesive,<br>
wherein the adhesive is received, at least partially, in the plurality of etched trenches.<br>
la a fifth aspect, there is provided a printhead integrated circuit suitable for bonding to a mounting surface of an ink manifold using an adhesive, said printhead integrated circuit comprising:<br>
a plurality of nozzles formed on a firontside of the printhead integrated circuit;<br>
a plurality of ink supply channels for supplying ink  from a backside of the printhead integrated circuit to the nozzles; and<br>
a plurality of etched trenches defined in the backside, the etched trenches being configured for receiving the adhesive during bonding.<br>
Hitherto, surface roughening was the only method used for improving the surface characteristics of substrates to be bonded. However, as explained above, surface roughening is<br><br><br><br>
Altematively, the first boadiag surface may have an average surface roughness (Re) of less than 20 nm, optionally an Ra of less than 5 run, or optionally an R of less than 1 nm.<br>
The adhesive is typically a liquid-based adhesive, or an adhesive which becomes liquid when heated for bonding. Optionally, the adhesive is an adhesive tape comprising an adhesive on one or both sides. Double-sided adhesive fihns or tapes are well known in the semiconductor art.<br>
Optionally, the first substrate cools during the bonding process. This is usually achieved by heating the first substrate (which may also melt the adhesive), and then allowing it to cool whilst bonding to the second substrate. An advantage of this option is that a partial vacuum is created in the trenches, above the adhesive, which helps to hold the substrates together during bonding. In a further aspect there is provided method wherein the first is substrate suitable for bonding to a second substrate using an adhesive, said first substrate having a plurality of etched trenches defined in a first bonding surface, the etched trenches being configured for receiving the adhesive during bonding.<br>

(a)	a plurality of printhead integrated circuits, each printhead integrated circuit<br>

Detailed Description of a Specific Embodiment<br>
A specific form of the invention is described below in the context of fabricating a printhead assembly for an inkjet printer. However, it will be appreciated that the invention may be used in coimection with bonding any two substrates together and is not in any way limited to the specific embodiment of printhead fabrication.<br>
Inkjet Printer Unit<br>
Fig. 1 shows a printer unit 2 comprising a media supply tray 3, which supports and supplies media 8 to be printed by the print engine (concealed within the printer casing). Printed sheets of media 8 are fed from the print engine to a media output tray 4 for collection. User interface 5 is an LCD touch screen and enables a user to control the operation of the printer unit 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the lid 7 of the printer unit 2 open to expose the print engine 1 positioned in the internal cavity 6. Picker mechanism 9 engages the media in the input tray 3 (not shown for clarity) and feeds individual streets to the print engine 1. The print engine 1 includes media transport means that takes the individual sheets and feeds them past a printhead assembly (described below) for printing and subsequent delivery to the media output tray 4 (shown rietracted).<br>
Print Engine <br>
Tbe print engine 1 is shown in detail in Figs. 3 and 4 and consists of two main parts: a cartridge unit 10 and a cradle unit 12.<br>
The cartridge unit 10 is shaped and sized to be received within the cradle unit 12 and secured in position by a cover assembly 11 mounted to the cradle unit. The cradle unit 12 is in turn configured to be fixed within the printer unit 2 to facilitate printing as discussed above.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows the print engine 1 in its assembled form with cartridge unit 10 secured in the cradle unit 12 and cover assembly 11 closed. The print engine 1 controls various aspects associated with printing in response to user irsputs from the user interface 5 of the printer unit 2. These aspects include transporting the media past the printhead in a controlled manner and the controlled ejection of ink onto the surface of the passing media.<br>
Cartridge unit<br>
The cartridge unit 10 is shown in detail in Figs. 5 and 6. With reference to the exploded view of Fig, 6, the cartridge unit 10 generally consists of a main body 20, an ink storage module assembly 21, a printhead assembly 22 and a maintenance assembly 23.<br>
Each of these parts are assembled together to form an integral unit which combines ink storage means together with the ink ejection means. Such an arrangement ensures that the ink is directly supplied to the printhead assembly 22 for printing, as required, and should there be a need to replace either or both of the ink storage or the printhead assembly, this can be readily done by replacing the entire cartridge unit 10.<br>
However, the operating life of the printhead is not limited by the supply of ink. The top surface 42 of the cartridge unit 10 has interfaces 61 for docking with a refill supply of ink to replenish the ink storage modules 45 when necessary. To further extend the life of the printhead, the cartridge unit carries an integral printhead maintenance assembly 23 that caps, wipes and moistens the printhead<br>
Printhead Assemblv<br>
The printhead assembly 22 is shown in more detail in Figs. 7 to 10, and is adapted to be attached to the underside of the main body 20 to receive ink from the outlets molding 27.<br>
The printhead assembly 22 generally comprises an elongate upper member 62 which is configured to extend beneath the main body 20, between the posts 26. A plurality of U-shaped clips<br>
63	project from the upper member 62. These pass through the recesses 37 provided in the rigid<br>
plate 34 and become captured by lugs (not shown) formed in the main body 20 to secure the<br>
printhead Assembly 22.<br>
The upper element 62 has a plurality of feed tubes 64 that are received within the outlets in the outlet molding 27 when the printhead assembly 22 secures to the main body 20. The feed tubes<br>
64	may be provided with an outer coating to guard against ink leakage.<br>
The upper member 62 is made from a liquid crystal polymer (LCF) which offers a number of advantages. It can be molded so that its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is similar to that<br><br>
of silicon. It will be appreciated that any significant difference in the CTE's of the printhead integrated circuit 74 (discussed below) and the underlying moldings can cause the entire structure to bow. However, as the CTE of LCP in the mold direction is much less than that in the non- mold direction (~5ppmyÂ°C compared to -20ppm/oC), care must be take to ensure that the m.old direction of the LCP moldings is unidhrectional with the longitudinal extent of the printhead integrated circuit (IC) 74. LCP also has a relatively high stif&amp;ess with a modulus that is typically 5 times that of 'normal plastics' such as polycarbonates, styrene. nylon, PET and polypropylene.<br>
As best shown in Fig. 8, upper member 62 has an open channel configuration for receiving a lower member 65, which is bonded thereto, via an adhesive film 66. The lower member 65 is also made  from an LCP and has a plurality of ink channels 67 formed along its length. Each of the ink channels 67 receive ink from one of the feed tubes 64, and distribute the ink along the length of the printhead assembly 22. The channels are 1 mm wide and separated by 0.75 mm thick walls.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the lower member 65 has five channels 67 extending along its length. Each channel 67 receives ink from only one of the five feed tubes 64, which in turn receives ink from one of the ink storage modules 45 (see Fig. 9) to reduce the risk of mixing different coloured inks. In this regard, adhesive film 66 also acts to seal the individual ink channels 67 to prevent cross channel mixing of the ink when the lower member 65 is assembled to the upper member 62.<br>
In the bottom of each channel 67 are a series of equi-spaced holes 69 (best seen in Fig. 9) to give five rows of holes 69 in the bottom surface of the lower member 65. The middle row of holes 69 extends along the centre-line of the lower member 65, directly above the printhead IC 74. As best seen in Fig. 15, other rows of holes 69 on either side of the middle row need conduits 70 from each hole 69 to the centre so that mk can be fed to the printhead IC 74.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, the printhead IC 74 is mounted to the underside of the lower member 65 by a polymer sealing film 71. This film may be a thennoplastic film such as a PET or Polysulphone film, or it may be in the form of a thermoset film, such as those manufactured by AL technologies and Rogers Corporation. The polymer sealing film 71 is a laminate with adhesive layer on both sides of a central film, and laminated onto the imderside of the lower member 65. As shown in Figs. 9,14 and 15, a plurality of holes 72 are laser drilled through the adhesive film 71 to coincide with the centrally disposed ink delivery points (the middle row of holes 69 and the ends of the conduits 70) for fluid communication between the printhead IC 74 and the channels 67.<br>
The thickness of the polymer sealing film 71 is critical to the effectiveness of the ink seal it provides. As best seen in Figs. 13 and 15, the polymer sealing film seals the etched channels 77 on the reverse side of the printhead IC 74, as well as the conduits 70 on the other side of the film.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
requirements are less critical, shapes other than a triangle can be used, for example, the dropped rows may take the form of a trapezoid.<br>
The upper surface of the printhead ICs have a number of bond pads 75 provided along an edge thereof which provide a means for receiving data and or power to control the operation of the nozzles 73 from the SoPEC device., To aid in positioning the ICs 74 correctly on the surface of the adhesive layer 71 and aligning the ICs 74 such that they correctly align with the holes 72 formed in the adhesive layer 71, fiducials 76 are also provided on the surface of the ICs 74. The fiducials 76 are in the form of markers that are readily identifiable by appropriate positioning equipment to indicate the true position of the IC 74 with respect to a neighbouring IC and the surface of the adhesive layer 71, and axe strategically positioned at the edges of the ICs 74, and along the length of the adhesive layer 71.<br>
In order to receive the ink from the holes 72 formed in the polymer sealing film 71 and to distribute the ink to the ink inlets 73, the underside of each printhead IC 74 is configured as shown in Fig 13. A number of etched channels 77 are provided, with each channel 77 in fluid communication with a pair of rows of inlets 73 dedicated to delivering one particular colour or type of ink. The channels 77 are about 80 microns wide, which is equivalent to the width of the holes 72 in the polymer sealing film 71, and extend the length of the IC 74. The channels 77 are divided into sections by silicon walls 78. Each sections is directly supplied with ink, to reduce the flow path to the inlets 73 and the likelihood of ink starvation to the individual nozzles 801. In this regard, each section feeds approximately 128 nozzles 801 via their respective inlets 73.<br>
Fig. 15B shows more clearly how the ink is fed to the etched channels 77 formed in the underside of the ICs 74 for supply to the nozzles 73. As shown, holes 72 formed through the polymer sealing film 71 are aligned with one of the channels 77 at the point where the silicon wall 78 separates the channel 77 into sections. The holes 72 are about 80 microns in width which is substantially the same width of the channels 77 such that one hole 72 supplies ink to two sections of the channel 77. It will be apredated that this halves the density of holes 72 required in the polymer sealing film 71.<br>
Following attachment and alignment of each of the printhead ICs 74 to the surface of the polymer sealing film 71, a flex PCB 79 (see Fig. 18) is attached along an edge of the ICs 74 so that control signals and power can be supplied to the bond pads 75 to control and operate the nozzles 801. As shown more clearly in Fig. 15, the flex PCB 79 extends from the printhead assembly 22 and folds around the printhead assembly 22.<br>
The flex PCB 79 may also have a plurality of decoupling capacitors 81 arranged along its length for controlling the power and data signals received. As best shown in Fig. 8, the flex PCB 79<br><br>
has a plurality of electrical contacts 180 formed along its length for receiving power and or data signals from the control circuitry of the cradle unit 12. A plurality of holes 80 are also formed along the distal edge of the ilex PCB 79 which provide a means for attaching the flex PCB to the flange portion 40 of the rigid plate 34 of the main body 20. The maimer in which the electrical contacts of the flex PCB 79 contact the power and data contacts of the cradle unit 12 will be described later.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, a media shield 82 protects the printhead ICs 74 from damage which may occur due to contact with the passing media. The media shield 82 is attached to the upper member 62 upstream of the printhead ICs 74 via an appropriate clip-lock arrangement or via an adhesive. When attached in this manner, the printhead ICs 74 sit below the surface of the media shield 82, out of the path of the passing media.<br>
A space 83 is provided between the media shield 82 and the upper 62 and lower 65 members which can receive pressurized air from an air compressor or the like. As this space 83 extends along the length of the printhead assembly 22, compressed air can be supplied to the space 56 from either end of the printhead assembly 22 and be evenly distributed along the assembly. The inner surface of the media shield 82 is provided with a series of fins 84 which define a plurality of air outlets evenly distributed along the length of the media shield 82 through which the compressed air travels and is directed across the printhead ICs 74 in the direction of the media delivery. This arrangement acts to prevent dust and other particulate matter carried with the media from settling on the surface of the printhead ICs, which could cause blockage and damage to the nozzles.<br>
INK  Delivery Nozzles<br>
Examples of a type of ink delivery nozzle arrangement suitable for printhead ICs 74 will now be described with reference to Figures 16 to 25. Figure 25 shows an array of ink delivery nozzle arrangements 801 formed on a silicon substrate 8015. Each of the nozzle arrangements 801 are identical, however groups of nozzle arrangements 801 are arranged to be fed with different colored inks or fixative. In this regard, the nozzle arrangetments are arranged in rows and are staggered with respect to each other, allowing closer spacing of ink dots during printing than would be possible with a single row of nozzles. Such an arrangement makes it possible to provide a high density of nozzles, for example, more than 5000 nozzles arrayed in a plurality of staggered rows each having an interspacing of about 32 microns between the nozzles in each row and about 80 microns between the adjacent rows. The multiple rows also allow for redundancy (if desired), thereby allowing for a predetermined failure rate per nozzle.<br><br>
Each nozzle arrangement 801 is the product of an integrated circuit fabrication technique, hi particular, the nozzle arrangement 801 defines a micro-electromechanical system (IslEMS).<br><br><br><br>
twisting movement that causes the lever and 8018 to move generally downwards. The movement is effectively a pivoting or hinging motion. However, the absence of a true pivot point means that the rotation is about a pivot region defined by bending of the passive beams 806.<br>
The downward movement (and slight rotation) of the lever arm 8018 is amplified by the distance of the nozzle wall 8033 from the passive beams 806. The downward movement of the<br><br>
nozzle wails and roof causes a pressure increase within the chamber 8029, causing the meniscus to bulge as shown in Fig. ] 7. It will be noted that the surface tension of the ink means the fluid seal 8011 is stretched by this, motion without allowing ink to leak out.<br>
As shown in Fig. 18, at the appropriate time, the drive current is stopped and the actuator beam 807 quickly cools and contracts. The contraction causes the lever arm to commence its return to the quiescent position, which in turn causes a reduction in pressure in the chamber 8029. The interplay of the momentum of the bulging ink and its inherent surface tension, and the negative pressure caused by the upward movement of the nozzle chamber 8029 causes thinning, and ultimately snapping, of the bulging meniscus to define an ink drop 802 that continues upwards until it contacts adjacent print media.<br><br><br><br><br>
arrangement having a nozzle chamber containing ink and a thennal bend actuator connected to a paddle positioned within the chamber. The thermal actuator device is actuated so as to eject ink from the nozzle chamber. The preferred embodiment includes a particular thermal bend actuator which includes a series of tapered portions for providing conductive heating of a conductive trace. The actuator is connected to the paddle via an arm received through a slotted wall of the nozzle chamber. The actuator arm has a mating shape so as to mate substantially with the surfaces of the slot ia the nozzle chamber wall.<br>
Turning initially to Figs. 27(a)-(c), there is provided schematic illustrations of the basic operation of a nozzle arrangement of this embodiment. A nozzle chamber 501 is provided filled<br><br><br>
the ink outside the nozzle rim and the corresponding backflow results in a general necking and brealdng off of the drop 512 which proceeds to the print media. The collapsed meniscus 505 results in a general sucking of ink into the nozzle chamber 502 via the ink flow channel 503. In time, the nozzle chamber 501 is refilled such that the position in Fig. 27(a) is again reached and the nozzle chamber is subsequently ready for the ejection of another drop of ink-Fig. 28 illustrates a side perspective view of the nozzle arrangement. Fig. 29 illustrates sectional view through an array of nozzle arrangement of Fig. 28. In these figures, the numbering of elements previously introduced has been retained.<br>
Firstly, the actuator 508 includes a series of tapered actuator units e.g. 515 which comprise an upper glass portion (amorphous silicon dioxide) 516 formed on top of a titanium nitride layer 517. Alternatively a copper nickel alloy layer (hareinafter called cupronickel) can be utilized which will have a higher bend efficiency.<br><br><br>
ink ejection nozzle arraagements laid out in interleaved lines so as to form a printhead array. Of course, different types of arrays can be formulated including full color arrays etc.<br>
The construction of the printhead system described can proceed utilizing standard MEMS techniques through suitable modification of the steps as set out in US 6,243,113 entitled "Image Creation Method and Apparatus (TJ 41)" to the present applicant, the contents of which are fully incorporated by cross reference.<br><br><br><br><br>
