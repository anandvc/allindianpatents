Turbine for a hydroelectric power station<br>
The present invention concerns a turbine for a hydroelectric power<br>
station for generating electrical energy as well as a hydroelectric power-<br>
station having a corresponding turbine.<br>
Hydroelectric power stations or hydroelectric power installations with<br>
turbines are known, which are divided substantially into three levels. The<br>
first level generally represents a support apparatus with which the turbine<br>
is held in its position in a passage. There is further provided a guide<br>
apparatus which is usually arranged in front of the rotor. Finally the rotor<br>
itself is arranged with the blades therebehind. That means that a flow in<br>
respect of a turbine of that kind is influenced at those three levels or<br>
locations.<br>
'Wasserkraftanlagen' ['Hydroelectric power installations'], 3rd<br>
edition, Springer Verlag 2003 by Jürgen Giesecke and Emil Mosonyi shows<br>
a number of hydroelectric power installations. Shown here for example is a<br>
Kaplan tube turbine. That turbine has an inlet shaft, the turbine and a<br>
suction hose, which are disposed very substantially in a line and are<br>
horizontal or slightly inclined relative to the horizontal. That has the<br>
advantage of avoiding a plurality of changes in the direction of flow, to the<br>
favour of a higher energy output. The turbine has support blades, guide<br>
blades and a rotor arranged therebehind, with corresponding blades.<br>
Straight-flow turbine units are also known, wherein a generator is<br>
arranged concentrically outside the flow tube so that the generator is not<br><br>
2<br>
disposed in the interior of the housing vessel. The rotor comprises a hub,<br>
rotor blades and a rotor ring, these being typically produced in the form of<br>
a welded structure to form a unit. A support cross arrangement is arranged<br>
in the flow direction upstream of the guide blades and the rotor with the<br>
rotor blades.<br>
The guide apparatus arranged in front of the rotor is used by rotation<br>
of the guide blades or support blades to shut down the turbine by the<br>
blades being so set that they bear against each other and thus close the<br>
passage.<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide a turbine<br>
and a hydroelectric power installation having a corresponding turbine which<br>
is of a simplified structure and affords greater power output.<br>
That object is attained by a turbine as set forth in claim 1 and by a<br>
hydroelectric power station as set forth in claim 6.<br>
There is thus provided a turbine for a hydroelectric power<br>
installation. The turbine has a rotor with a plurality of blades, wherein the<br>
rotor is arranged in front of a guide apparatus (in the flow direction). The<br>
pitch angle of the blades of the rotor is adapted to be variable.<br>
By virtue of the fact that the rotor is arranged in front of the guide<br>
apparatus (in the flow direction), the flow encounters the rotor first and<br>
only thereafter encounters the guide apparatus, thus affording optimum<br>
flow conditions for the rotor.<br>
The fact that no separate support apparatus is provided means that<br>
the losses of a flow around the support apparatus are completely<br>
eliminated, thereby affording an increased level of efficiency in comparison<br>
with the state of the art.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention the rotor has a<br>
spherical hub for connecting the turbine blades to the rotor. The spherical<br>
configuration of the hub makes it possible to adjust the pitch angle of the<br>
turbine blades over a great extent.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention the<br>
turbine blades bear in positively locking relationship against the spherical<br><br>
3<br>
hub so that it is possible to avoid disadvantageous flow conditions as the<br>
turbine blades join the hub.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention the pitch angle<br>
of the turbine blades can be adjusted in an angle of -20° to 140° so that<br>
the rotor can be decelerated or accelerated if the pitch angle of the turbine<br>
blades is appropriately selected.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention are subject-matter of the<br>
appendant claims.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter with reference<br>
to the drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1a shows a diagrammatic view of a turbine according to the<br>
first embodiment,<br>
Figure 1b shows a further diagrammatic view of a turbine according<br>
to the first embodiment,<br>
Figure 1c shows a front view of a turbine according to the first<br>
embodiment,<br>
Figure 2a shows a diagrammatic view of a turbine according to the<br>
second embodiment,<br>
Figure 2b shows a further diagrammatic view of a turbine according<br>
to the second embodiment,<br>
Figure 2c shows a front view of a turbine according to the second<br>
embodiment,<br>
Figure 3a shows a diagrammatic view of a turbine according to the<br>
third embodiment,<br>
Figure 3b shows a further diagrammatic view of a turbine according<br>
to the third embodiment, and<br>
Figure 3c shows a front view of a turbine according to the third<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 1a shows a diagrammatic view of a turbine in accordance with<br>
a first embodiment. Figure lb shows a further view of the turbine as shown<br>
in Figure 1a. Figure 1c shows a front view of the turbines of Figures 1a and<br>
1b. The turbine has a rotor 4 with turbine blades 1 which are connected to<br>
a hub 3 which is of a substantially spherical configuration, The rotor 4 with<br><br>
4<br>
the turbine blades 1 is disposed in front of a guide apparatus 6 in the flow<br>
direction. The present turbine is thus an upstream rotor turbine. In other<br>
words, the guide apparatus 6 is behind the rotor 4 and at the same time<br>
supports the rotor in the passage so that an additional support apparatus<br>
can be omitted. The guide apparatus 6 thus also has a mounting<br>
arrangement.<br>
Accordingly the flow firstly meets the rotor 4 in an undisturbed<br>
condition so that a maximum amount of energy can be taken from the flow<br>
before the flow encounters the guide apparatus 6. In that respect the guide<br>
apparatus 6 is designed in such a way that an optimum discharge flow of<br>
the water is ensured by reducing swirl losses, thus preventing a build-up<br>
accumulation and a collapse in the level of efficiency that this entails.<br>
The guide apparatus has support blades 5. In the first embodiment<br>
there are seven support blades 5. The support blades 5 are preferably not<br>
designed to be adjustable.<br>
The blades 1 of the rotor 4 are variable in a range of -20° to 140°,<br>
preferably from -10° to 120°, so that pitch adjustment of the turbine blades<br>
1 is possible. In that way the blades of the rotor can be displaced into any<br>
position without a gap being formed between the turbine blades 1 and the<br>
rotor as the turbine blades 1 bear in positively locking relationship against<br>
the hub by virtue of the spherical shape thereof.<br>
By adjustment of the blades 1 through 90° the blades are turned into<br>
what is referred to as the 'feathered position', that is to say the water flows<br>
past the blades and through the guide apparatus 6 without causing the<br>
rotor 4 to move. As a result water can flow away through the turbine<br>
passage even when the turbine is not in operation and the passage does<br>
not have to be shut off in order to decelerate and possibly stop the rotor.<br>
Adjustability of the support blades is not required by virtue of the<br>
adjustment of the blades of the rotor 4 and by virtue of the fact that the<br>
rotor 4 can be stopped by virtue of the fact that the blades can be rotated<br>
into a feathered position.<br>
Figures 2a to 2c show a turbine in accordance with the second<br>
embodiment. In this case the structure of the turbine of the second<br><br>
5<br>
embodiment substantially corresponds to the structure of the turbine of the<br>
first embodiment. As in the first embodiment there are seven support<br>
blades 5 in the guide apparatus. As a departure from the first embodiment<br>
however there are four blades on the rotor.<br>
Figures 3a to 3c each show a turbine in accordance with the third<br>
embodiment. The structure of the turbine of the third embodiment<br>
substantially corresponds to the structure of the turbine of the first and<br>
second embodiments. In contrast to the turbines of the first and second<br>
embodiments there are five support blades 5 in the guide apparatus.<br>
In the three embodiments shown hereinbefore the blades 1 of the<br>
rotor 4 are adapted to be adjustable so that the turbine can be shut down<br>
by adjustment of the blades. That means that adjustability of the blades of<br>
the guide apparatus is not necessary, for interrupting the flow in the<br>
passage.<br>
In the three embodiments shown hereinbefore the rotor is connected<br>
to a shaft 10 which in turn can be coupled to an electrical generator in<br>
order to convert the rotational movement of the shaft 10 into electrical<br>
energy.<br>
The turbine according to the invention is thus an upstream rotor<br>
turbine, that is to say the guide apparatus is disposed behind the rotor. The<br>
guide apparatus is both the support and the mounting arrangement for the<br>
turbine. The blades 1 of the rotor 4 are adapted to be adjustable in an<br>
angle of from -20° to 140°. The hub 3 of the rotor 4 is of a substantially<br>
spherical configuration so that the blades 1 of the rotor 3 can be set to any<br>
desired angle without a gap being present. The flow thus first encounters<br>
the rotor 4 before it is further passed into the guide apparatus 6, thus<br>
affording optimum flow conditions for the rotor 4. The turbine according to<br>
the invention thus has only two levels, that is to say the rotor and the<br>
guide apparatus.<br><br>
