				<td>This invention relates to a yarn feeder for feeding atleast one yarn to a textile<br>
machine.<br>
The invention relates to a yarn feeder for feeding at leaft one yarn to a<br>
textile machine having a base support on which at least one lever, which can be<br>
pivoted around an essentially horizontal pivot axis, is provided, one end of which,<br>
located at the end remote from the pivot axis, is In contact wlh the yam under<br>
the force of its own weight.<br>
Elements for monitoring whether the yarn running to or out ef the yarn<br>
feeder is correctly present, and whether the yarn delvered by the yam feeder is<br>
provided in the correct amount or wlh the correct tension, are often provided on<br>
yarn feeders. In both cases hoop-shaped levers are often provided, which are<br>
plvotably seated on the yarn feeder and rest on the yarn wlh one end.<br>
For example, such a yarn feeder is known from US Patent 5,860,298. The<br>
yarn feeder has a yarn feeding drum fastened on a vertical shaft and arranged in<br>
a yarn delivery path. The yarn feeler levers, which extend obliquely downward<br>
and rest with their free ends on the yarn, are arranged in the yarn deivery path<br>
upstream and downstream of the yarn feeding drum. If the yarn breaks, or too<br>
large an amount of yarn is present, the levers pivot downward under the force of<br>
their own weigh and in the process actuate switches, which for example can be<br>
used for stopping the downstream-located textile machine<br>
The levers are pivoted under the force of their own weight. This must be a<br>
minimum weight in order to assure a dependable pivot movement, even if the<br>
yarn feeder is subjected to a certain amount of soiling in the course of the actual<br>
operating conditions. On the other hand, this results in increased friction at the<br>
yarn guide lever, which can be disadvantageous in particular in connection with<br>
thin and/or delicate yarns. If a particularly low yarn tension is desired, problems<br>
arise from too large a contact force, particularly because the yarn feeler lever<br>
tensions the yarn. The minimal yarn tensioning force must be great enough for<br>
the yarn to aft the yarn feeler lever.<br>
Based on the foregoing, it is the object of the invention to provide a<br>
remedy here. This objected is attained by means of a yarn feeder having the<br>
lever, which is pivotably seated on the base support, is connected with a relief<br>
device, which reduces the weight of the lever by means of a spring.<br>
force in at least a portion of its pivot range. Thus, the relief device leads to the lever<br>
resting on the yarn with a comparatively reduced force. By means of this It is possible<br>
to reduce the friction between the yarn and the respective location of the lever. It is<br>
moreover possible to monitor even relatively thin yarn and/or to operate at reduced<br>
yarn tension.<br>
Preferably the reduction of the weight of the lever is a function of the pivot angle. It<br>
is possible in this way to realize a deflection-dependent contact force on the yarn,<br>
which depends on the deflection angle of the lever In a non-linear manner. This can<br>
increase the triggering dependability, even if the yarn feeder is subjected to solling.<br>
Spring elements for generating a force which counters the weight permit a weight<br>
reduction without causing a noticeable increase in the moment of inertia of the lever,<br>
so that the latter can rapidly respond to a yarn break or decreasing yarn tension.<br>
Wear-reducing ceramic elements can be arranged on the yarn feeler element. The<br>
weight relief compensates their weight at least partially. The service the of the<br>
elements which are in contact with the yarn is increased by the ceramic elements.<br>
Preferably the spring element acts on the lever by means of a lever arm of such a<br>
type, that a neutral point is provided in the pivot range, wherein the spring element<br>
does not introduce a torque into the lever. The sign of the torque is reversed in this<br>
neutral point, so that the spring element switches from a weight relief to an additional<br>
weight. This can increase the switch-off dependability.<br>
Preferably the spring element is a part of an electrical switch, so that no additional<br>
switch actuation forces need be provided. The force generated for the weight relief is<br>
also the switch-off force. This has the considerable advantage that the full (not<br>
relieved and not reduced) weight of the lever is available for actuation the switch,<br>
although the lever has been relieved of the weight from the viewpoint of the yarn.<br>
For example, the spring element can be constituted by a U-shaped spiral spring. In<br>
addition the latter can be advantageously used as a switching element, if the spiral<br>
spring has comparatively long legs, i.e. the legs are longer than their distance from<br>
each other, the spiral spring element is pivoted out relatively strongly, even at a small<br>
pivot movement of the lever.<br>
It can be used as a switching member of a swlch, wherein good and clearly defined<br>
switching points are provided because of the possible gearing, i.e. the comparatively<br>
greater pivot movement of the spiral spring in comparison with the pivot movement of<br>
the lever.<br>
Further advantageous details of the Invention ensue from the drawings.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is represented in the accompanying<br>
drawings. Shown are in:<br>
Fig. 1, a yarn feeder in a perspective representation,<br>
Fig. 2, the yarn feeder in Fig. 1 in a lateral view,<br>
Fig. 3, a housing element of the yarn feeder in Figs. 1 and 2 with the inserted<br>
contact elements and a weight relief mechanism for the yarn feeler levers, and<br>
Fig. 4, the weight relief mechanism of the yarn feeler in Figs. 1 and 2 in a schematic<br>
lateral view.<br>
A yarn feeder 1 is represented in Fig. 1, which is used to deliver yarn 2 to a textile<br>
machine, not further shown. The yarn feeder 1 has a base support 3, which is to be<br>
connected by means of a fastening device 4 with the textile machine, or with a holder<br>
provided on the latter, and which forms a dual-shell housing. A yarn feeding drum 5<br>
on a vertically arranged, rotatabty seated shaft and connected at one end with the<br>
shaft, is provided on the base support 3. The other end of the shaft can be connected<br>
via a clutch disk 6 with drive disks 7, 8.<br>
The yarn 2 is wound several times around the yarn feeding drum 5 and, when the<br>
latter is rotatingty driven, is positive^ delivered to the downstream-connected textile<br>
machine. Yarn guide elements 9, 11 are arranged in Ms running path for the<br>
continued guidance of the yam 2. Part of these is a yarn inlet eye 12, a yarn brake<br>
device 14 and an inlet eye 15 arranged between the yarn brake device 14 and the<br>
yarn feeding drum 5.<br>
A feeler lever 16 is arranged on the yarn inlet side between the yarn brake device 14<br>
and the inlet eye 15. The feeler lever 16 is embodied to be hoop-shaped. With two<br>
legs 17 It extends around the base support 3 and is seated on or respectively in the<br>
latter and is pivotable around a pivot axis 18. The yarn feeler lever 16 rests with its<br>
end 19, which is provided with a wear-reducing coating or a wear-reducing element,<br>
on the yarn 2. This can be seen hi Fig. 2 in particular.<br>
A further feeler lever 21 is provided on the outlet side of the yarn feeder 1, which is<br>
seated, pivocable around a horizontal pivot axis 22, on the base support 3. The yarn feeler<br>
lever 21 is<br>
also embodied in a hoop shape and on its lower free end has an eye 23 made of a resistant, for<br>
example ceramic material. In this case the eye 23 is essentially arranged between two yarn<br>
eyes 24, 25, which are a part of the yarn guide elements 11, and rests on the yarn 2. If the<br>
latter is tensed, it lifts the eye 23 between the yarn guide eyes 24, 25. In the area of contact<br>
with the yarn,<br>
the eye 23 has a very large radius. Sharp yarn deflections are prevented by this. The eye 23<br>
is wear-resistant to a large extent in respect to the yarn, but has a not negligible mass. The<br>
eye 23<br>
can also be a ceramic-coated shaped element which, however, also increases the weight of the<br>
shutoff element.<br>
Both levers 16, 21 have been lifted out of their freely downwardly suspended position by<br>
the yarn 2. If the yarn tension ceases, the levers 16, 21 pivot downward. In the process they<br>
actuate an electrical switch, which is connected with contact elements 26 arranged in the area<br>
of the fastening device 4. An indicator lamp 27 is additionally triggered to signal the status<br>
which has occurred.<br>
The yarn guide levers 16, 21 are weight-relieved. This means that they do not rest on the<br>
yarn 2 with their entire force caused by their weight.<br>
A weight-relieving device 31 is represented in Fig. 4, which acts on the lever 16 with a<br>
torque indicated by an arrow 32, which acts counter to the torque caused by the weight of the<br>
lever 16 (arrow 33). A spring element 34 embodied as a compression spring is part of the<br>
weight-relieving device 31. It is formed by a spiral spring 37 having two legs 35, 36 and is<br>
made of spring metal. The two legs 35, 36 are angled away from each other.<br>
The lever 16 is connected with a body 38, which is arranged concentrically in respect to<br>
the pivot axis 18 and, on its side facing the spiral spring 37, has a seating recess 39. The<br>
latter receives the free end of the leg 36. But the other leg 35 is supported in a seating recess<br>
41 of a contact element 42. The contact point between the leg 35 and the bottom of the recess<br>
constitutes a seating or hinge point. In the same way, the contact point between the free end<br>
of the leg 36 and the bottom of the recess 39 is a seating or hinge point. The distance of the<br>
bottom of the seating recess 39 from the pivot axis 18 forms a short lever L, which forms an<br>
obcuse angle in respect to the connecting line between the recesses 39, 41.<br>
The spiral spring element 37 extends in the direction toward a contact element 43, on<br>
whose free end a contact spring 44 is maintained. The latter is arranged in such a way that its<br>
free, tongue-like, resilient end projects into the pivot range of the spiral spring 37. Here, the<br>
pivot range is of such dimensions that the spiral spring element 37 does not touch the contact<br>
tongue 44 when the lever 16 is in the desired position, while the spiral spring element 37<br>
comes into contact with the contact tongue 44, when the lever 16 is pivoted downward. The<br>
angular<br>
position of the lever L and the connecting line between the support points 41, 39 is of such<br>
dimensions that the torque 32 decreases when the lever 16 is pivoted downward. It initially<br>
moves toward zero and, when the support point 39 moves below the connecting line between<br>
the pivot axis 18 and the support point 41, it can also change its sign and thereby further<br>
increase the<br>
downward pivoting of the lever 16.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 3, the lever 21 can also be provided with a similar relief device 31.<br>
Thus, both relief devices constitute electrical switches, which can be connected to the strip<br>
conductors 50, 51, 52. The strip conductors can be used for contacting the signal lamp 27, or<br>
respectively the contacts 26 (Fig. 2).<br>
The yarn feeder 1 described so far operates as follows:<br>
As represented in Fig. 2, during operation the yarn 2 maintains both levers 16, 21 in the<br>
raised position, in which the spiral springs 37 are not in contact with their respectively<br>
assigned contact tongues 44. Here, the spiral springs 37 support the levers 16, 21 and<br>
generate a torque acting opposite the torque generated by the respective inherent weight of<br>
the levers 16, 21 and partially compensates it. It is slightly less than the inherent torque of<br>
the respective levers 16, 21, so that the latter rests on the yarn 2 with a clearly reduced<br>
weight.<br>
If, for example, a yarn break occurs at the yarn inlet, the yarn force maintaining the lever<br>
16 in position falls off and the lever 16 initially pivots downward with a reduced force.<br>
However.<br>
the weight compensation is simultaneously reduced, so that now the lever is clearly and<br>
strongly pivoted downward and closes the associated switch. The same action occurs if a<br>
yarn break takes<br>
place on the outlet side of the yarn feeder, or too large an amount of yarn is delivered, so that<br>
the yarn starts to sag between the yarn guide eyes 24 and 25.<br>
One or several yarn guide levers 16, 21 are provided in a yarn feeder 1, which rest on the<br>
yarn 2 with a force which is small in the desired position of the lever, i.e. when the yarn run is<br>
correct. If the lever pivots out because the yarn tension is reduced or the yarn has broken, the<br>
force with which the lever 16, 21 rests on the yarn 2 increases. This is caused, for example,<br>
by<br>
a weight-relieving device 31, which partially compensates the weight of the lever and<br>
provides a compensating force as a function of the pivot angle. With an increase in pivoting<br>
out the compensation force is preferably reduced.<br>
