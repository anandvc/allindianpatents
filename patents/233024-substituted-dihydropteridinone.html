				<td>The present invention relates to substituted dihydropteridinone.<br>
The present invention relates to new dihydropteridinones of general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the groups L, R1, R2, R3, R4and R5 have the meanings given in the claims and specification, the isorpers thereof, processes for preparing these dihydropteridinones and the use thereof as medicaments.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Pteridinone derivatives are known from the prior art as active substances with an antiproliferative activity. WO 01/019825 describes the use of pteridinone derivatives for the treatment of neoplastic and viral diseases. The resistance of many types of tumours calls for the development of new pharmaceutical compositions for combating tumours.<br>
WO 03/20722 discloses some dihydropteridionone derivatives substituted with an aminoaryl or aminoheteroaryl group at position 2 and their use as inhibitors of cell cycle kinases. WO 01/019825 discloses fully unsaturated pteridinone derivatives which are either pteridine-7-ones or pteridine-6,7-diones and their use as inhibitors of cdks and growth factor mediated kinases. WO 02/76985 discloses compounds useful as kinase inhibitor which are not pteridine-6-ones. Ferrand G. et al., Eur. J. med. Chem. (1996) 31, 273-280, discloses 3H-pteridine-4-one derivatives and suggest their use as therapeutic agent against allergy or inflammation.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to prepare new compounds with antiinflammatory and antiproliferative activity.<br>
^<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that compounds of general formula (I) wherein<br>
the groups L and R1 to R5 have the meanings given hereinafter act as inhibitors<br>
of specific cell cycle kinases. Thus, the compounds according to the invention<br>
may be used for example to treat diseases connected with the activity of<br>
specific cell cycle kinases and characterised by excessive or abnormal cell<br>
proliferation.<br>

Table 1<br>
(Table Removed 1)<br>
As has been found, the compounds of general formula (I) are characterised by their wide range of applications in the therapeutic field. Particular mention should be made of those applications in which the inhibition of specific cell cycle kinases, particularly the inhibiting effect on the proliferation of cultivated human tumour cells but also the proliferation of other cells, such as endothelial cells, for example, plays a part.<br>
As could be demonstrated by FACS analysis, the inhibition of proliferation brought about by the compounds according to the invention is mediated by the arrest of the cells, particularly at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The cells arrest, independently of the cells used, for a specific length of time in this phase of the cell cycle before programmed cell death is initiated.   An arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle is triggered, for example, by the inhibition of specific cell cycle kinases. Studies in model organisms such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe or Xenopus, or investigations in human cells have shown that the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis is regulated by the CDK1/cyclin B kinase (Nurse, 1990). This kinase, which is also known as the "mitosis promoting factor" (MPF), phosphorylates and thereby regulates a number of proteins, such as e.g. nuclear lamins, kinesin-like motor proteins, condensins and Golgi matrix proteins, which play an important part in the breakdown of the nuclear envelope, in centrosome separation, the formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus, chromosome condensation and the breakdown of the Golgi apparatus (Nigg. E., 2001). A murine cell line with a temperature-sensitive CDK1 kinase mutant shows a rapid breakdown of the CDK1 kinase and a subsequent arrest in the G2/M phase after a temperature increase (Th'ng et al., 1990). The treatment of human tumour cells with inhibitors against CDK1/cyclin B such as e.g. butyrolactone also leads to an arrest in the G2/M phase and subsequent apoptosis (Nishio, et al. 1996). Another kinase which is involved in the G2 and mitosis phase is polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which is responsible for the maturation of the centrosomes, for the activation of the phosphatase Cdc25C, as well as for the activation of the anaphase promoting<br>
complex (Glover et al., 1998, Qian, et al., 2001). The injection of Plk1 antibodies leads to a G2 arrest in untransformed cells whereas tumour cells arrest in the mitosis phase (Lane and Nigg, 1996). In addition, the protein kinase aurora B has been described as having an essential function during entry into mitosis. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser11 and thereby initiates chromosome condensation (Hsu, J.Y. et al., 2000). A specific cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase may, however, also be triggered e.g. by the inhibition of specific phosphatases such as e.g. Cdc25C (Russell and Nurse, 1986). Yeasts with a defective cdc25 gene arrest in the G2 phase, while overexpression of cdc25 leads to early entry into the mitosis phase (Russell and Nurse, 1987). However, an arrest in the G2/M phase can also be triggered by the inhibition of certain motor proteins, so-capped kinesins such as e.g. Eg5 (Mayer et al., 1999), or by agents which stabilise or destabilise microtubules (e.g. colchicin, taxol, etoposide, vinblastin, vincristin) (Schiff and Horwitz, 1980).<br>
In view of their biological properties the compounds of general formula I according to the invention, their isomers and their physiologically acceptable salts are suitable for the treatment of diseases characterised by excessive or abnormal cell proliferation.<br>
Such diseases include, for example: viral infections (e.g. HIV and Kaposi's sarcoma); inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (e.g. colitis, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, glomerulonephritis and wound healing); bacterial, fungal and/or parasitic infections; leukaemias, lymphoma and solid tumours; skin diseases (e.g. psoriasis); bone diseases; cardiovascular diseases (e.g. restenosis and hypertrophy). They are also suitable for protecting proliferating cells (e.g. hair, intestinal, blood and progenitor cells) from damage to their DMA caused by radiation, UV treatment and/or cytostatic treatment (Davis et al., 2001).<br>
The new compounds may be used for the prevention, short-term or long-term treatment of the abovementioned diseases, also in combination with other active substances used for the same indications, e.g. cytostatics.<br>
The activity of the compounds according to the invention was determined in the cytotoxicity test on cultivated human tumour cells and/or in a FACS analysis, for example on HeLaS3 cells. In both test methods, the compounds exhibited a good to very good activity, i.e. for example an EC5o value in the HeLaS3 cytotoxicity test of less than 5 umol, generally less than 1 umol.<br>
Measurement of cvtotoxicitv on cultivated human tumour cells To measure the cytotoxicity on cultivated human tumour cells, cells of the cervical cancer tumour cell line HeLaS3 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) in Ham's F12 Medium (Life Technologies) and 10% foetal calf serum (Life Technologies) were cultivated and harvested in the logarithmic growth phase. Then the HeLaS3 cells were placed in 96-well plates (Costar) at a density of 1000 cells per well and incubated overnight in an incubator (at 37°C and 5 % CO2), while on each plate 6 wells were filled only with medium (3 wells as a control of the medium, 3 wells for incubation with reduced AlamarBlue). The active substances were added to the cells in various concentrations (dissolved in DMSO; final concentration: 1%) (in each case as a triple measurement). After 72 hours' incubation, 20µl of AlamarBlue (AccuMed International) were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 7 hours. As a control, 20µl of reduced Alamar Blue (AlamarBlue reagent which had been autoclaved for 30 min) were added to 3 wells. After 7 h incubation the colour change of the AlamarBlue reagent in the individual wells was determined in a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation 530 nm, emission 590 nm, slits 15, integrate time 0.1). The amount of AlamarBlue reagent reacted represents the metabolic activity of the cells. The relative cell activity was calculated as a percentage of the control (HeLa S3 cells without inhibitor) and the active substance concentration which inhibits the<br>
cell activity by 50% (1C50) was obtained. The values were calculated from the average of three individual measurements, correcting for the control value (medium control).<br>
FAGS Analysis<br>
Propidium iodide (PI) binds stoichiometrically to double-stranded DNA, and is thus suitable for determining the percentage of cells in the G1, S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle on the basis of the cell DNA content. Cells in the GO and G1 phase have a diploid DNA content (2N), whereas cells in G2 or mitosis have a 4N DNA content.<br>
For PI staining, 0.4 million HeLaS3 cells were seeded, for example, on a 75 cm2 cell culture flask, and after 24 h either 1 % DMSO was added as control or the substance was added in various concentrations (in 1% DMSO). The cells were incubated for 24 h with the substance or with DMSO, before the cells were washed with 2 x PBS and detached with trypsin /EDTA. The cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C), and the cell pellet was washed 2 x with PBS, before the cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS. Then the cells were fixed with 80% ethanol for 16 hours at 4°C or alternatively for 2 hours at -20°C. The fixed cells (106 cells) were centrifuged (0100 rpm, 5 min, 4°C), washed with PBS and then centrifuged again . The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of Triton X-100 in 0.25 % PBS, and incubated for 5 min on ice, before 5 ml of PBS were added and the mixture was centrifuged again. The cell pellet was resuspended in 350µI of PI stain solution (0.1 mg/ml of Raze A, 10µg/ml of presidium iodide in 1 x PBS). The cells were incubated for 20 min in the dark with the stain buffer before being transferred into sample measuring vessels for the FACS scan. The DNA measurement was carried out in a Becton Dickinson FACS Analyzer, with an argon laser (500 mW, emission 488 nm), and the DNA Cell Quest Program (BD). The logarithmic PI fluorescence was determined with a band-pass filter (BP 585/42). The cell populations in the individual phases of the cell cycle were quantified with the ModFit LT program of Becton Dickinson.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be used on their own or combined with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. Suitable preparations include for example tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, particularly solutions for injection (s.c., i.v., i.m.) and infusion, syrups, emulsions or dispersible powders. The amount of pharmaceutically active compound in each case should be in the range from 0.1 - 90 wt.%, preferably 0.5 - 50 wt.% of the total composition, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient to achieve the dosage range given below. The doses specified may, if necessary, be given several times a day.<br>
Suitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatine, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for delaying release, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers.<br>
Coated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arable, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number of layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets.<br>
Syrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharin, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents<br>
such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.<br>
Solutions for injection and infusion are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, optionally using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, while if water is used as the diluent organic solvents may optionally be used as solubilisers or auxiliary solvents, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules or infusion bottles.<br>
Capsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof.<br>
Suitable excipients may be, for example, water, pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents, such as paraffins (e.g. petroleum fractions), oils of vegetable origin (e.g. groundnut or sesame oil), mono- or polyfunctional alcohols (e.g. ethanol or glycerol), carriers such as e.g. natural mineral powders (e.g. kaolin, clays, talc, chalk), synthetic mineral powders (e.g. highly dispersed silica and silicates), sugar (e.g. glucose, lactose and dextrose), emulsifiers (e.g. lignin, spent sulphite liquors, methylcellulose, starch and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate).<br>
The preparations are administered in the usual way, preferably by oral or transdermal route, particularly preferably by oral route. When administered orally the tablets may, of course, contain additives, such as e.g. sodium citrate,<br>
calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate together with various additives,<br>
such as starch, preferably potato starch, gelatine and the like, in addition to the<br>
abovementioned carriers. Lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
laurylsulphate and talc may also be used to form tablets. In the case of aqueous<br>
suspensions the active substances may be combined with various flavour<br>
enhancers or colourings in addition to the abovementioned excipients.<br>
For parenteral use, solutions of the active substances may be prepared using<br>
suitable liquid carrier materials.<br>
The dosage for intravenous use is 1 -1000 mg per hour, preferably between 5 -<br>
500 mg per hour.<br>
However, it may optionally be necessary to deviate from the amounts specified, depending on the body weight or method of administration, the individual response to the medication, the nature of the formulation used and the time or interval over which it is administered. Thus, in some cases, it may be sufficient to use less than the minimum quantity specified above, while in other cases the upper limit specified will have to be exceeded. When large amounts are administered it may be advisable to spread them over the day in a number of single doses.<br>
