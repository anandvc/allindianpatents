COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]                        "DISPERSE DYE MIXTURES"<br>
BASF   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,    a   German   company,    of       D-67056 Ludwigshafen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
This invention relates to mixtures of disperse dyes, compositions comprising dispersions of such mixtures and processes for the colouration of synthetic materials with such mixtures. More particularly, the invention relates to mixtures of the dyes of the so-called pyrroline type with those of the so-called anthraquinone type.<br>
Dyes of the pyrroline type are disclosed, for example, in US-A-3013013, US-A-3013018, GB-A-2191498, EP-A-0327077, EP-A-0511625 and WO-A-94010248. .<br>
In particular, WO-A-94010248 discloses dyes of the pyrroline type having the formula (1)<br><br>
Formula (1)<br>
wherein:<br>
Formula (2)<br>
D is a group of Formula (2):<br><br><br>
or a group of Formula (3) :<br>
Formula (3)<br>
or a group of Formula   (4) :<br><br><br>
Formula 4<br>
R1  is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl or. aralkyl each of which may be optionally substituted;<br>
R2  is optionally substituted C7_20-alkyl; or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a pyrrolidine or piperidino ring;<br>
R3 is alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl each of which may be optionally substituted, ,-S02alkyl, -S02aryl, or -COR in which R is -H or alkyl, phenyl, cycloalkyl or aralkyl each of which may be optionally substituted, or -H; and<br>
R4  is an electron withdrawing group;<br>
R6  is optionally substituted C1_16-alkyl; or R1 and Rs together with the nitrogen atom to which they<br><br>
are attached form a pyrrolidino or piperidino<br>
ring; R7, R8, R9 and R10  each independently is alkyl, cycloaklyl, aryl, alkenyl or aralkyl, each of which may be optionally substituted or -H; W   is oxygen or sulphur; Z   is a direct link or N-R11 in which R11 is -H or<br>
optionally substituted alkyl or aryl; Ring A  is unsubstituted apart from the -NR1R2 group<br>
or is substituted by from 1 to 4 further<br>
groups; and Ring B   is unsubstituted or substituted by from 1 to<br>
3 groups; except for 3-(4-(N,N~di-n-<br>
octylamino)phenyl) -4-cyano-5-dicyano<br>
methylidene-2-oxo-2,5-dihydropyrrole provided that:<br>
(a)	when D is a group of Formula (3), R1 and R6 are different and R1 is not -C2H5/ ~ C3H7 or -C4H9 when R6 is -C2H4phenyl, -C3Hsphenyl and ethyl substituted by -OH, -CN, -OCH3/ -OC2H4OC2H5, -NHCOCH3 -Ophenyl and -NHS02CH3;<br>
(b)	at least one of R1 and Rs is branched chain alkyl.<br>
where RA is H (Kayalon Polyester Brilliant Blue F2B-S); or CH2CH=CH2 (Kayalon Polyester Blue-Green FG-S); and<br>
Commercially available dyes of the pyrroline type are, for example, dyes of the formula:<br><br><br>
dyes of the formula<br><br>
where XA is C4H9 and YA is CH(CH3)CsH:11<br>
Dyes of the anthraquinone type are also well -known.  For example, dyes and mixtures_of dyes each within the formula given below are commercially available as C.I. Disperse Blue 60 type dyes:<br><br>
where RB is   (CH2)n -O-RB1,   in which n is  1-6 and RB1 is straight or branched alkyl or alkoxy   (and examples of RB  are_C2H40CH3,   C3Hs0CH3/   C3H6OC2Hs and C3H6OC2H4OCH3   ) and Za is  0 or NH.<br>
However,   if dyes of the pyrroline type alone   (or mixtures of such pyrroline-type dyes)   are dyed on polyester,   build up to heavy depths of shade is difficult to  achieve,   light  fastness  is average  at<br><br>
best, the dyes tend to be rather sensitive to changes<br>
in the pH of dyeing and undesirable redder shades are<br>
sometimes seen.	 <br>
If dyes of the anthraquinone type alone (or mixtures of such anthraquinone-type dyes) are dyed on polyester, they often exhibit very good light fastness, but with poor build up. Moreover, they are. tinctorially very weak and therefore expensive for colouring polyester. Moreover, high strength liquid or grain formulations cannot be achieved.  In addition, although good build up can be achieved, the shade becomes duller as the dye builds up.<br>
We have now found surprisingly that if certain dyes of the pyrroline type are .mixed with certain dyes, of the anthraquinone type, brighter shades are maintained as the dyes build up.  Moreover, the dyeings have good light fastness.  In particular, as compared with anthraquinone dyes alone, when using mixtures with pyrroline dyes, products of high colour strength can be readily formulated, with greater cost-effectiveness.<br>
Thus the invention provides a dye mixture comprising<br>
(A)  at least one pyrroline type dye of the formula<br>
(I);<br><br><br>

As previously mentioned, component (A) may be a mixture of two or more dyes of Formula (I) wherein R1 to R3 inclusive, D and Ring A are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Reference is now made to component (B), which preferably comprises at least one anthraquinone type dye of the formula (II), wherein ZB is O or NH, more preferably 0, n is 1, 2 or 3, more preferably 2 or 3 and Ra1 is methyl, ethyl or methoxyethyl.

The dyes of the formula (II) wherein RB is hydrogen may be prepared, for example, by reaction of 2,3-dicyano-l,4-diamino~anthraquinone with sulphuric acid.  This dye may then be reacted with a primary amine RBXNH2 to obtain a dye of the formula (II) wherein RBX is any of the groups of RB other than hydrogen. Alternatively, certain of such dyes of the formula (II) may be prepared from the 2,3-dicyano-l,4-<br><br>
diaminoanthraquinone by reaction with each of sulphuric acid and a secondary alcohol to provide a dye wherein RBX is secondary alkyl. Another method of preparing dyes of the formula (II) where RB is a group as previously defined other than hydrogen is by reaction of the corresponding 1,4-diaminoanthraquinone carboxylic anhydride with a primary amine RBXNH2 where RBX is as defined above.  Such reactions are disclosed in Ventkataraman, The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes, Academic Press, New York and London, 1970, Vol- III,<br>
pages 413-415.<br>
In general, in. a preferred mixture of components (A) and (B), the ratio by weight, of component (A) : component (B) is from 3:97 to 60:40 inclusive, more preferably from 8:92 to 40 : 60 inclusive, especially<br>

wherein R2 is C4H9, R3 is 3-phenylpropyl and R1 is H (A5)<br>
or allyl (As) or a mixture of dyes (A5) and (A6); and<br>

At least for a mixture of component A(l), with component (B), the ratio, by weight, of component A(l) : component (B) is preferably from 5 : 90 to 30 : 70 inclusive.<br>
A mixture embodying the invention of at least one dye of formula (I) (component A) and at least one dye of the formula (II) (component B) may additionally comprise at least one other dye (component C), especially a yellow, orange, red or brown dye capable of producing a navy or black shade.<br>
Mixtures embodying the invention can be prepared by a number of methods including<br>
(1) Co-crvstallisation<br>
Typically, the dyes are dissolved in a hot solvent, for example, by placing the dyes in a suitable solvent and heating up to the reflux temperature of the solvent until the dyes are dissolved, thereafter filtering to provide a solution, and then allowing the solution to cool and crystals to form.  The resultant mixture may then undergo further processing, such as milling and spray drying. Examples of suitable solvents for this process are organic solvents.such as aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, alcohols, amides, sulphoxides, esters, ketones and ethers.  Specific examples of organic solvents are toluene, ethyl cellosolve, acetone, chlorobenzene, pyridine, dimethyl formamide, diemthylsulphoxide, ethyl acetate, benzene, tetrahydrofuran and cyclohexane.<br><br><br>
(2)	Co-milling<br>
(a)	The dyes are mixed and then milled together . to give an intimate blend which is then spray dried to give a solid mixture; or<br>
(b)	each dye is milled separately and then mixed in the required ratio before spray drying.<br>
(3)	Dry Blending<br>
Each dye is spray dried separately, and then mixed in the required ratio by a dry blending process.<br>
The mixtures give especially bright shades which are maintained as the dyes build up. Dyeings with the mixtures have good light fastness. The mixtures have high colour strength and can be readily and cost-effectively formulated.<br>
Mixtures embodying the invention provide especially useful disperse dyes valuable for colouring synthetic textile materials and fiber blends thereof by exhaust dyeing, padding or printing, and may be formed into dispersions for this purpose. They may also be used in, for example, ink jet printing of textiles and non-textiles, dye diffusion, thermal transfer printing and in the colouration of plastics.<br>
According to other aspects, the invention provides a composition comprising at least the dye mixture and a dispersing agent, surfactant or wetting agent, suitable for providing such a dispersion and-also a process  for colouring a synthetic textile material or fibre blend thereof which comprises applying to the synthetic textile material or fibre blend a mixture comprising at least one dye of the formula (I) and at least one dye of the formula (II).<br><br>
