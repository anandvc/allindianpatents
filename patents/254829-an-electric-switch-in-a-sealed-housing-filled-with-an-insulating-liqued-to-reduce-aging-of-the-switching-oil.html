The invention relates to a tap changer filled with an<br>
insulating liquid and devices for absorbing the thermally<br>
induced volume fluctuations of this insulating liquid.<br>
The invention makes it possible to hermetically seal the switch<br>
vessel and therefore considerably reduce the aging of the<br>
switch oil.<br>
The use of the arrangement according to the invention<br>
furthermore makes it possible to dispense with dehumidifiers,<br>
an external expansion vessel and associated pipelines.<br>
Furthermore, the invention solves the problem of the<br>
accumulation of gases in the pipeline to the expansion vessel<br>
of hermetically sealed switches.<br>
Tap changers of the type mentioned above are predominantly used<br>
in power transformers for regulating the voltage on load.<br>
During operation, considerable temperature fluctuations result<br>
from heating of the transition resistors, heat emission by the<br>
insulating and cooling medium of the transformer surrounding<br>
the switch and its vessel, and further influences. These bring<br>
about significant changes in the volume of the insulating<br>
liquid of the tap changer. Furthermore, thermal decomposition<br>
of the insulating liquid and resultant gas development result<br>
from switching arcs and/or heating of the transition resistors.<br>
These gases rise upward as a result of their lower density and<br>
need to be discharged by means of suitable measures.<br><br>
The prior art involves the use of expansion vessels, which are<br>
fitted above the transformer and are connected to the switch<br>
via a suitable pipeline. Both the flow of insulating liquid in<br>
the case of thermally -induced changes in volume and the<br>
transport away of the gases take place via this pipeline.<br>
It is known to use a common expansion vessel for the<br>
transformer and the switch, but this results in mixing of the<br>
insulating liquids. At present predominantly a two-chamber<br>
expansion vessel is therefore used. Such expansion vessels are<br>
described, for example, in DE19527763C2.<br>
One disadvantage of these expansion vessels is the contact<br>
between the oil surface and the outside air, which requires the<br>
use of so-called dehumidifiers. In these dehumidifiers, the air<br>
is passed over a desiccant and thereby dehumidified. This<br>
depletes the absorption capacity of the desiccant<br>
(hygroscopicity), and the desiccant needs to be replaced<br>
regularly. The periodically required visual inspections and the<br>
regular replacement of the desiccant, in particular in areas of<br>
high humidity, represent a considerable cost factor<br>
(recommended maintenance interval: 3 months). These<br>
dehumidifiers furthermore do not provide safe sealing from the<br>
absorption of moisture and oxygen by the insulating liquid, in<br>
particular when the transformer cools quickly.<br>
DE10010737A1 describes a hermetically sealed transformer which<br>
provides an expansible radiator for volume compensation. The<br>
use of such a radiator for<br><br>
compensating for the volume expansion of the insulating liquid<br>
of the switch requires considerable complexity and entails<br>
problems when discharging gases from the switch vessel. For the<br>
expansion of the insulating liquid of transformers, expansion<br>
vessels are known which use a diaphragm for separating the<br>
insulating liquid from the ambient air in the main chamber.<br>
Such an expansion vessel is described in DE3206368. Although<br>
these expansion vessels provide safe sealing of the insulating<br>
liquid from the ambient air, they nevertheless require a<br>
dehumidifier, which has the associated drawbacks already<br>
mentioned. In addition, the contact with the ambient air<br>
results in aging of the diaphragm and therefore gives rise to<br>
technical uncertainties.<br>
It is also known to use gas cushions directly beneath the cover<br>
of transformers (DE7103 89). However, this solution provides no<br>
possible way of separating harmful gases from the gas cushion.<br>
DE10224074A1 has described an arrangement for the pipeline<br>
leading into the tap changer, which arrangement uses a<br>
labyrinth system for avoiding the flow of gases to the<br>
expansion vessel.<br>
However, this system neither provides hermetic sealing of the<br>
switch nor allows the penetration of gases into the pipeline to<br>
be completely prevented. The complex pipeline arrangement to<br>
the oil expansion vessel is also still required.<br>
In addition, DE3504916C2 has disclosed an expansion vessel,<br>
which is fitted directly on the tap changer head. This solution<br>
likewise requires a dehumidifier, which results in the known<br>
disadvantages which have already been mentioned at the outset.<br><br>
A hermetic seal can not be achieved by these means, either.<br>
The invention described in the text which follows allows for<br>
compensation of the change in volume of the insulating liquid<br>
during operation of the switch, whilst avoiding the above-<br>
mentioned disadvantages.<br>
The present invention uses a gas cushion for absorbing the<br>
thermally induced volume fluctuations in the insulating liquid<br>
of the switch. In accordance with the invention, this gas<br>
cushion is integrated in the switch vessel. The switch vessel<br>
is hermetically sealed both with respect to the atmosphere and<br>
with respect to the insulating medium of the transformer.<br>
Furthermore, the gas cushion is separated from the insulating<br>
liquid by a flexible wall. The gas cushion is located in<br>
displacement bodies, which, by changing their shape and size,<br>
absorb the volume fluctuations of the insulating liquid.<br>
The separation of the insulating liquid from the gas cushion<br>
which is brought about by the flexible wall of the displacement<br>
bodies causes the effect in accordance with the invention of<br>
gas contained in the gas cushion not mixing with the gases<br>
produced by thermal decomposition of insulating liquid. The gas<br>
cushions for volume compensation are arranged in such a way in<br>
accordance with the invention that they do not prevent the<br>
gases produced by switching arcs and/or by heating of the<br>
transition resistors from rising and being discharged.<br>
As a result of this arrangement according to the invention, the<br>
compensation body is part of the switch. Additional, external<br>
components are dispensed with and result in a simplification of<br>
the entire transformer. Problems associated with gas<br>
accumulations in pipelines and the flow of oil being impeded in<br>
the case of temperature<br><br>
changes in the insulating liquid are ruled out as a result 01<br>
the components affected by these problems being dispensed with.<br>
As a result, operational faults are avoided as a result of gas<br>
cushions in conjunction with the expansion vessel in hermetic<br>
transformers. In addition, this design makes it possible to<br>
provide a special gas collection area, which prevents the<br>
pressure relief valve from responding too frequently and the<br>
additional loss of oil which is often associated with this.<br>
In a further embodiment, the upper region of the switch is<br>
provided with an additional volume for accommodating a certain<br>
quantity of additional insulating liquid in order to replace<br>
the oil lost during decomposition as a result of switching<br>
operations and/or heating of the transition resistors. The gas<br>
resulting in the case of oil decomposition rises upward and<br>
collects in this additional area. The considerably larger gas<br>
volume results in an excess pressure in the switch vessel. If<br>
the pressure in the switch exceeds a predetermined limit value,<br>
the pressure relief valve, which is closed during normal<br>
operation, opens and provides pressure relief with the<br>
atmosphere surrounding the switch.<br>
The inventive design of the volume compensating device allows<br>
the insulating liquid of the switch to be sealed completely<br>
from the atmosphere/ambient air. The absorption of moisture and<br>
oxygen by the insulating liquid is prevented. Any influence	on<br>
the electric strength of the insulating liquid by means	of<br>
moisture is prevented, and aging of the insulating liquid	is<br>
significantly reduced.<br>
The outer expansion vessel, the dehumidifier and the associated<br>
pipelines can be dispensed with. It is possible<br><br>
to eliminate the regular checking of the state of the desiccant<br>
in the dehumidifier, and this results in cost savings owing to<br>
Tihe fact that the costly, regular replacement of the desiccant<br>
is dispensed with. Environmental pollution and disposal<br>
problems as a result of used desiccants are avoided.<br>
Advantageously, the switch according to the invention is<br>
equipped with a gas outlet valve (D3). This can expediently be<br>
designed or controlled in such a way that it responds in the<br>
case of a low gas pressure, but not when an insulating liquid<br>
is present. This makes it possible for the gases to be<br>
continuously pumped away. A pressure valve and/or a<br>
conventional large-area pressure relief valve (D2) is used for<br>
protection against excess pressure. As a result of the<br>
combination of a pressure relief device which is independent of<br>
the fill level and a pressure relief device which is dependent<br>
on the fill level and responds even in the case of a low excess<br>
pressure, safe anti-bursting means can be made possible for the<br>
switch vessel in the case of gases which are formed being<br>
discharged continuously.<br>
The rate of the necessary volume compensation during heating is<br>
dependent on the thermal time constants of the transformer and<br>
of the switch and the operating conditions, but in any case<br>
takes place very slowly. In order to keep surging changes in<br>
volume (large quantities of gas arising as a result of<br>
decomposition of the insulating liquid) away from the<br>
compensating apparatus in the event of a fault, it is<br>
advantageous to provide pressure dampers (DD) in the channel to<br>
the compensating apparatus. These pressure dampers (DD) can be<br>
formed from a reduction in cross section over the path of the<br>
insulating liquid to the compensating body.<br>
At the same time, it is necessary to provide for the gases to<br>
be passed to a pressure relief valve (D2) or another<br><br>
pressure reduction apparatus in such a way as to cause little<br>
obstruction and delay to the discharge of the gases.<br>
In a further particular embodiment, the compensating body is<br>
provided with a spring element (Fl) in order to achieve a<br>
predetermined pressure movement. These spring elements can also<br>
be formed by the body of the compensator itself.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the compensating apparatus is<br>
equipped with volume limiting means in one or else both<br>
directions. As a result, pressure movement corresponding to<br>
particular requirements can be realized, for example, in the<br>
switch vessel. This limitation is likewise possible as a result<br>
of the travel of the compensating elements being limited and a<br>
multi-part compensating apparatus with chambers having<br>
different spring constants.<br>
In further embodiments, the gas cushions are designed in such a<br>
way that it is possible for them to be incorporated in<br>
functional parts of the switch and therefore only a small<br>
amount of space is required. An exemplary embodiment of this<br>
solution is the use of metal expansion bodies as the shielding<br>
electrode.<br>
The embodiment of the compensating bodies according to the<br>
invention in the form of a metal compensator, bubble memory,<br>
roll diaphragm, foil sack, plastic diaphragm or rubber<br>
compensator is possible. As a result of the arrangement in<br>
accordance with the invention, the required compensating bodies<br>
(K) do not come into contact with the atmosphere (1), so that<br>
the corrosion of metal compensators under the influence of<br>
moisture and the aging of plastic diaphragms under the effect<br>
of moisture, oxygen and ozone are avoided. As a result, the<br>
requirements placed on the compensating bodies used are<br>
considerably reduced.<br><br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, these displacement<br>
elements are represented by simple gas-filled balloons, whose<br>
wall is formed by a metal foil. Particularly cost-effective is<br>
the use of oil-resistant rubber or plastic or foils from the<br>
mentioned materials. In order to achieve the gas<br>
impermeability, the displacement bodies may be made from<br>
metallized plastic foil or thin metal foil. In order to achieve<br>
the required thermal and elastic properties given extremely low<br>
gas diffusion, multilayer foils can be used (for example with<br>
the use of: ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers/<br>
fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymers/nitrile-butadine<br>
rubber). The materials used can likewise be provided with a<br>
textile or glass fiber inlay.<br>
In addition, compensators are possible which have a low<br>
pressure or vacuum and are expanded or stretched via spring<br>
elements.' The change in shape and volume is in this case<br>
determined by the interaction of spring force and internal<br>
compensator pressure with the switch pressure.<br>
Advantageously, the displacement bodies are dimensioned in such<br>
a way that they are vacuum-tight in order to permit the<br>
conventional filling process for large-scale transformers. This<br>
can be provided by a combination of suitable dimensions and<br>
wall thicknesses, but also by a supporting structure, in the<br>
case of foils.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments.<br>
Figure 1 shows a switch (S1) with a switch head (SK), which is<br>
arranged on the cover (TD) of a transformer. The area within<br>
the switch (S1) is filled with<br><br>
insulatin, liquid. Since the housing of the switch (SW)<br>
hermetically seals the latter, during heating of the insulating<br>
liquid of the switch there is an increase in the internal<br>
pressure in the switch. This increase in pressure causes the<br>
gas in the compensating apparatuses (K6) to be compressed.<br>
Gases which are formed by thermal decomposition of the oil rise<br>
upward and are passed to a monitoring device (B3) . If the<br>
quantity of gas is too great, gas is let out via a valve (D3).<br>
As a result of this arrangement according to the invention, the<br>
compensating body is part of the switch. Additional external<br>
components are dispensed with and result in a simplification of<br>
the entire transformer. Advantageously, component parts which<br>
are in any case present in the switch are included in the<br>
design of the compensating bodies.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment in which the<br>
compensating bodies are formed by bellows. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, these compensating bodies (K3, K6) are accommodated<br>
both in the lower part of the switch and in the central pipe of<br>
the switch (Z1) formed from an insulating cylinder. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, furthermore parts of the electrical<br>
shields (A2) are in the form of metal expanding bodies.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment in which the volume<br>
compensation is formed by a large number of compensating bodies<br>
(K5). These compensating bodies do not impede the ascent of the<br>
gases resulting from thermal decomposition of insulating<br>
liquid. In the exemplary embodiment, these gases collect in the<br>
interspaces of the compensating bodies (K5) accommodated in the<br>
head region and displace insulating liquid there. When a<br>
predetermined quantity of gas (oil level) is present, the<br>
measuring and control unit (M64) causes the gas outlet<br><br>
valve (M67) to open and the harmful gases enter the atmosphere<br>
(1) or an interposed evaluation unit (gas analysis). These<br>
compensating bodies can be produced in a cost-effective manner<br>
 and can be introduced into various switch types in different<br>
quantities.<br>
The compensating bodies illustrated in the exemplary<br>
embodiments can be accommodated in a very wide variety of<br>
regions of the switch. Furthermore, this embodiment makes it<br>
possible to use a large number of so-called dead spaces for<br>
volume compensation. In the exemplary embodiment, these<br>
compensating bodies are accommodated both in the head region of<br>
the switch and in the central pipe of the switch (Z1) formed<br>
from an insulating cylinder. In the event of individual cells<br>
losing their sealtightness, only these individual cells are<br>
filled with oil, and the entire system is not at risk. Escaping<br>
gas passes to the Buchholz relay and, in the event of damage to<br>
a corresponding quantity of displacement elements, results in<br>
the latter being triggered. If compensating bodies (K5) are<br>
accommodated in the lower region of the switch, a stop (GS)<br>
prevents these compensating bodies from ascending. This stop is<br>
advantageously designed in such a way that it keeps escaping<br>
gases away from electrically loaded parts in the event of<br>
defects in individual compensating bodies. Advantageously,<br>
these gases are passed in the central cylinder (Zl) or the<br>
switch shaft safely into.the head region of the switch.<br>
Figure 4 shows a switch which, in the upper region of the<br>
housing (SW), is provided with an additional volume (VZ) for<br>
accommodating a suitable quantity of additional insulating<br>
liquid in order to replace the oil lost during decomposition of<br>
the oil, for example by means of heating of the transition<br>
resistors. Since the oil volume is very small in comparison<br>
with the gas volume resulting during the decomposition, a small<br><br>
quantity of insulating liquid is sufficient for the period of<br>
time between main inspections. When using vacuum switching<br>
cells (SZ) it is possible, in a paricular exemplary embodiment,<br>
to accommodate the entire oil supply for the life of the switch<br>
as a result of the in this case markedly reduced, thermally<br>
induced oil decomposition. The gas resulting in the case of oil<br>
decomposition rises upward and collects in this additional area<br>
(VZ) . As a result of the considerably larger gas volume, there<br>
is an excess pressure in the switch vessel. If the pressure in<br>
the switch exceeds a predetermined limit value, the gas outlet<br>
(M67), which is closed during normal operation, opens and<br>
provides pressure relief with the atmosphere (1) surrounding<br>
the switch. Advantageously, a controller (M51, M64) regulates<br>
the system in such a way that a response of the gas outlet<br>
(M67) only takes place if a predetermined quantity of gas is<br>
provided in the head region of the switch. The protection of<br>
the pressure waves is undertaken by the pressure relief valve<br>
(D2) . The subsequent flow of oil from the upper part of the<br>
switch area (VZ) and the act of the gas produced being let out<br>
make possible a further degree of maintenance freedom of the<br>
switch in the case of a small physical size and complete<br>
sealing of the insulating liquid from the atmosphere and<br>
without an external oil expansion vessel being required.<br>
Figure 5 shows an exemplary embodiment of a switch designed in<br>
accordance with the invention, in which the expansion of the<br>
compensator (K6) is transferred via a connection accommodated<br>
in the central pipe (Z1) to an evaluation unit (M6) and is used<br>
for indicating the fill level and/or pressure. Likewise<br>
illustrated is the transfer of the compensator movement via an<br>
encoder (M3) (for example: permanent magnet) to a detection<br>
unit (M2).<br><br>

16.	The switch as claimed in claim 15, wherein these apparatuses<br>
(D2,D3,M67) are controlled as a function of the oil level in the switch (S1).<br>
17.	The switch as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein undesirable<br>
changes in position of the compensating elements (K3, K5, K6, A2)<br>
brought about by lifting force are prevented by means of suitable stops<br>
(GS).<br><br>
18. The switch as claimed in one of the preceding claims, comprising a<br>
volume for accommodating a small quantity of additional insulating liquid<br>
in order to replace the lost oil due to decomposition from switching<br>
operations and/or heating of transition resistors.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE"AN ELECTRIC SWITCH IN A SEALED HOUSING FILLED WITH AN<br>
INSULATING LIQUID TO REDUCE AGING OF THE SWITCHING OIL"<br>
The invention relates to an electric switch (S1) in a sealed housing (SW)<br>
filled with an insulating liquid, characterized in that a gas cushion is<br>
provided for absorbing thermally induced volume fluctuations, in that the<br>
gas cushion is integrated in the electric switch vessel (S1), in that the gas<br>
cushion is formed by compensating elements (K3, K5, K6, A2), which are<br>
enabled to absorb the volume fluctuations of the insulating liquid by<br>
correspondingly adjusting their shape in that an enveloping of the gas<br>
cushions prevents mixing of gases produced by thermal decomposition of<br>
the insulating liquid with the gas in the gas cushion, and in that the<br>
compensating apparatus (K3,K5,K6,A2) is at least partially electrically<br>
conductive and acts as a shielding electrode/electrical shield (A2).</td>
