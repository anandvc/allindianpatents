				<td>A FLEXIBLE MIXING BAG FOR MIXING SOLIDS, LIQUIDS AND<br>
GASES<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention generally relates to mixing of substances and more particularly to<br>
a flexible mixing bag for mixing of solids, liquids, gases and combinations thereof.<br>
Background<br>
The mixing of substances, such as different types of solids, liquids and/or gases<br>
has a number of applications in different industries. For example, in the pharmaceutical<br>
industry, different types of drugs are mixed together. In the medical field, body fluids<br>
(such as blood) and/or drugs are typical substances that are mixed. The agricultural<br>
industry also incorporates mixing operations into a number of applications. For<br>
example, water is mixed with dehydrited food for the rehydration of such food.<br>
However, in these and other industries, the substances that are mixed may be<br>
hazardous, dangerous and/or infectious. For example, in the pharmaceutical and/or<br>
medical industries, the substances that are to be mixed may be toxic. Additionally, in a<br>
number of situations, the handling of powders may be dangerous because of the<br>
possibilities of inhalation of such powders. Furthermore, in the medical field,<br>
individuals that handle body fluids, such as fluids that are HIV-infected, do so without<br>
attempting direct contact of these fluids.<br>
Conventional mixing devices generally involve a glass tank for substances that<br>
are of small volumes and a stainless steel tank for substances of larger volumes. These<br>
tanks often include a screw to agitate and maintain powders within suspension. Such<br>
screws arc also used to homogenize multiphase solutions. Prior to use, these mixing<br>
tanks must be washed and sterilized. Typically, an autoclave is used for washing and<br>
sterilizing small volume tanks, while a water steam-based operation is employed for<br>
washing and sterilizing larger volume anks. These wash and sterilize operations, which<br><br>
are essential to mixing when using such devices, are typically time consuming,<br>
expensive and require highly qualilied individuals. Further, periodic maintenance of<br>
these mixing devices must be perfomed to ensure proper operation. In certain cases,<br>
such washing/sterilizing operations as well as the maintenance of these mixing devices<br>
may represent more than a third of the total cost of the mixing devices and maintaining<br>
thereof, which may be prohibitive for given applications. Additionally, mixing of<br>
substances may cause the pressure to increase within these conventional mixing devices.<br>
If this increased pressure is not ac :ounted for, the mixing of such substances may<br>
become dangerous, wherein the tanks could break apart/explode due to this internal<br>
pressure. Moreover, with the use of many mixing devices currently employed to mix<br>
Pharmaceuticals, one cannot be certain whether any such pharmaceutical has been<br>
displaced outside the mixing device and therefore the amount of pharmaceutical<br>
remaining inside the mixing device, after mixing, may not be sufficiently accurate or<br>
precise. This is problematic when the FDA requires the administration of such a<br>
pharmaceutical in precise, accurate an i known quantities.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Embodiments of the inventicn may be best understood by referring to the<br>
following description and accompanying drawings which illustrate such embodiments.<br>
The numbering scheme for the Figure; included herein are such that the leading number<br>
for a given reference number in a Figure is associated with the number of the Figure.<br>
For example, a flexible mixing tank 100 can be located in Figure 1. However, reference<br>
numbers are the same for those elements that arc the same across different Figures. In<br>
the drawings:<br>

Summary<br>
In one embodiment, a flexible mixing tank is a single-use apparatus used to mix<br>
two or more substances. Accordingly, the flexible mixing tank is discarded after a single<br>
use, thereby eliminating the washing sterilizing operations as well as the maintenance<br>
associated with convention mixing devices. Moreover, as will be described, in one<br>
embodiment, a number of inlet and outlet openings are incorporated into the flexible<br>
mixing tank to reduce the amount of human contact with the substances (which may be<br>
hazardous, dangerous and/or infections) that are to be mixed as part of and during the<br>

Figure 1 illustrates a frontal view of a flexible mixing tank, according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. In particular, Figure 1 illustrates a frontal view of a .<br>
flexible mixing tank (apparatus/device) 100 that includes a film 110 that defines a first<br>
compartment 120A and a second compartment 120B. The first compartment 120A and<br>
the second compartment 120B are separated by a connection (conduit) 130. As shown,<br>
the connection 130 is a two-part connector for the first compartment 120A and the<br>
second compartment 120B.<br>
The first compartment 120A has an interior wall 137A that defines a storage area<br>
configured to house a first substance. The first compartment 120A also includes a distal<br>
end 135A and a proximal end 136A, which are distal and proximal relative to the<br>
connection 130. As shown, beginning at the distal end 135A, the diameter of the first<br>
compartment 120A decreases as the proximal end 136A is approached. In other words,<br>
in an embodiment, a diameter of the storage area at the proximal end 136A of the first<br>
compartment 120A. is less in comparison to a diameter of the storage area at the distal<br>
end 135A of the first compartment 120A.<br>
The second compartment 12018 has an interior wall 137B that defines a storage<br>
area configured to house a second substance. The second compartment 120B also<br>
includes a distal end 135B and a proximal end 136B, which are distal and proximal<br>
relative to the connection 130. As shown, beginning at the distal end 135B, the diameter<br>
of the second compartment 120B decreases as the proximal end 136B is approached. In<br>
other words, in an embodiment, a diameter of the storage area at the proximal end 136B<br>
of the second compartment 120B is le:s in comparison to a diameter of the storage area<br>
at the distal end 135B of the second compartment 120B.<br><br>
The flexible mixing tank 100 (including the compartments 120 and the<br>
connection 130) is part of a single film. During use/operation, the first compartment<br>
120A and the second compartment 120B communicate with each other through the<br>
connection 130. The connection 130 defines a passageway between the first<br>
compartment 120A and the second compartment 120B. In particular, a substance in the<br>
first compartment 120A and a substance in the second compartment 120B communicate<br>
with each other (e.g., are mixed together) through the connection 130.<br>
As shown, the connection 130 in reference to the first compartment 120A and the<br>
second compartment 120B provide an hour glass-shaped flexible mixing tank that allows<br>
the connection 130 to throttle the admixing of a first substance in the first compartment<br>
120A with a second substance in the second compartment 120B. Moreover, this hour<br>
glass-shaped flexible mixing tank allows for the isolation of the two substances prior to<br>
or during the admixing operation by closing the connection 130 through a number of<br>
devices (e.g., a clamp).<br>
The first compartment 120A includes a number of inlet openings 150A and an<br>
outlet opening 160A. The second compartment 120B includes a number of inlet<br>
openings 150B and an outlet opening 150B. A more detailed description of the different<br>
components of the flexible mixing tank 100 will be; described below in conjunction with<br>
the description of the different components of a flexible mixing tank 200 shown in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a frontal vie v of a flexible mixing tank, according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. In particular, Figure 2 illustrates a frontal view of a<br>
flexible mixing tank (apparatus/device) 200 that includes a film 210A, a film 210B and a<br>
film 210C. The film 210A defines a fust compartment 220A. The film 210B defines a<br>
second compartment 220B. The film 210C defines a third compartment 220C. The first<br>
compartment 220A, the second compartment 220B and the third compartment 220C are<br>
separated by a connection (conduit) 230 In an embodiment, the different compartments<br>
220A-220C are separately formed from different films 210, wherein the connection 230<br><br>
is a junction element having a number of handles 270A-270C for connecting the<br>
compartments 220A-220C to the junction element.<br>
The first compartment 220A has an interior wall 237A that defines a storage area<br>
configured to house a first substance. The first compartment 220A also includes a distal<br>
5 end 235A and a proximal end 23 SA, which are distal and proximal relative to the<br>
connection 230. As shown, beginn ng at the distal end 235A, the diameter of the first<br>
compartment 220A decreases as the proximal end 236A is approached. In other words,<br>
in an embodiment, a diameter of the storage area at the proximal end 236A of the first<br>
compartment 220A is less in comparison to a diameter of the storage area at the distal<br>
0 end 235A of the first compartment 220A.<br>
The second compartment 220B has an interior wall 237B that defines a storage<br>
area configured to house a second substance. The second compartment 220B also<br>
includes a distal end 235B and a proximal end 236B, which are distal and proximal<br>
relative to the connection 230. As shown, beginning at the distal end 235B, the diameter<br>
5 of the second compartment 220B decreases as the proximal end 236B is approached. In<br>
other words, in an embodiment, a diameter of the storage area at the proximal end 236B<br>
of the second compartment 220B is ess in comparison to a diameter of the storage area<br>
at the distal end 235B of the second compartment: 220B.<br>
The third compartment 220C has an interior wall 237C that defines a storage area<br>
0 configured to house a second substance. The third compartment 220C also includes a<br>
distal end 235C and a proximal end 236C, which are distal and proximal relative to the<br>
connection 230. As shown, beginning at the distal end 235C, the diameter of the third<br>
compartment 220C decreases as the proximal end 236C is approached. In other words,<br>
in an embodiment, a diameter of the storage area at the proximal end 236C of the third<br>
5 compartment 220C is less in comparison to a diameter of the storage area at the distal<br>
end 235C of the third compartment 220C.<br>
During use/operation, the first compartment 220A, the second compartment 220B<br>
and the third compartment 220C con municate with each other (e.g., are mixed together)<br><br>
through the connection 230. The connection 230 defines a passageway between the first<br>
compartment 220A, the second compartment 220B and the third compartment 220C. In<br>
particular, a first substance in the first compartment 220A, a second substance in the<br>
second compartment 220B and a third substance in the third compartment 220C<br>
communicate with each other through the connection 230. The connection 230 is a<br>
junction element that includes a handle 270A coupled to the first compartment 220A, a<br>
handle 270B coupled to the second compartment 220B and a handle 270C coupled to the<br>
third compartment 220C. Accordingly for the connection 230, the number of handles<br>
equals the number of compartments 220 in the flexible mixing tank 230. The connection<br>
230 (acting as a junction element) may be coupled to the different compartments 220<br>
based on a number of different types of connections. For example, the connection 230<br>
may be coupled to the different compartments 220 by joining, welding or with an<br>
intermediate element such as a clanping collar, heat shrinkable sleeve, shrink down<br>
plastic tubing or a nesting/screwing connection. While the connection 130 in the flexible<br>
mixing tank 100 of Figure 1 is not i lustrated as a junction element having a number of<br>
handles 270, embodiments of the invention are not so limited, as the connection 130 (in<br>
Figure 1) could be replaced with a junction element like the connection 230, wherein the<br>
junction element includes two handles.<br>
As shown, the connection 220 in reference to the first compartment 220A, the<br>
second compartment 220B and the third compartment 220C provide a wheel of<br>
compartments 220 whose axis is the connection 230. Because of the small size of the<br>
openings from the compartments 220 into the connection 230, the connection 230 is able<br>
to throttle the admixing of the different substances in the different compartments 220<br>
together. Further, this small size of the openings allows for the isolation of substances<br>
prior to or during the admixing opera ion by closing one or more of the passages into the<br>
connection 230 (using a number of different devices, such as a clamp). For example, the<br>
passage from the first compartment 220A into the connection 230 may be closed, while<br>
the flexible mixing tank 200 rotates to allow for admixing of the substance in the second<br><br>
compartment 220B with the substance in the third compartment 220C. Subsequently, the<br>
passage of the first compartment 220A may be opened to allow for the admixing of the<br>
substance in the first compartment 220A with the result of the admix operation of the<br>
substances in the second compartment 220B and the third compartment 220C.<br>
Accordingly, (as will be described in more detail below) this opening and closing of the<br>
openings into the connection 230 allows for the mixing of different substances in a given<br>
order at different points in time, thereby enabling a precise mixing protocol to be<br>
followed with regard to the substance in the compartments 220.<br>
The first compartment 220A includes a number of inlet openings 250A and an<br>
outlet opening 260A. The second compartment 220B includes a number of inlet<br>
openings 250B and an outlet opening 260B. The third compartment 220C includes a<br>
number of inlet openings 250C and an outlet opening 260C.<br>
A more detailed description of the different components of the flexible mixing<br>
tank 100 of Figure I and the flexible mixing tank 200 of Figure 2 will now be described.<br>
The films 100/210A-210C may be any type of flexible material for providing a flexible<br>
mixing apparatus (e.g., different types of plastics). For example, the films 110/210A-<br>
210C may be heat-welded plastic films. In an embodiment, the films 110/210A-210C<br>
are plastic films with a thickness in range of 10 to 400 millimeters (depending on the<br>
type of application). While the films 110/210A-210C may be made from a number of<br>
different plastics, in an embodiment, the films 110/210A-210C are made from a plastic<br>
that includes the following group: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl<br>
chloride (PVC, polyethylene terephtalate (PET) and Teflon. In an embodiment, the<br>
films 110/210A-210C are a stretchable material, having a deformation, e.g., of less than<br>
approximately five percent when subjected to a tensile force of 100 gmf per inch (per<br>
2.54 cm) of width. The films 110/210A-210C define the compartments 120/220 such1<br>
that the substances therein are isolatec from the outside medium/environment. The films<br>
110/210A-210C also have a mechanical resistance such that the flexible mixing tank<br>
100/200 may be used under pressure from the outside medium/environment.<br><br>
In an embodiment, the compartments 120/220 are approximately clear to allow<br>
for the viewing of the substances and the mixture thereof, such that one skilled in the art<br>
may determine when the mix operation is complete based on viewing of the substances.<br>
In one embodiment, the surface of the compartments 120/220 includes volumetric indicia<br>
for measuring the volume of the substances therein.<br>
In an embodiment, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is a single-use apparatus. In<br>
particular, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is used a single time to mix, at least partially,<br>
substances in the different compartments 120/220. The result of the mixing of the<br>
substances is removed from the flexible mixing tank 100/200 (as described in more detail<br>
below). Thereafter, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is discarded. Accordingly, there is<br>
no need to wash/sterilize the flexible mixing tank 100/200 in preparation for subsequent<br>
uses. Moreover, because the flexible mixing tank 100/220 is a single-use apparatus, the<br>
flexible mixing tank 100/200 does not have the ongoing maintenance costs associated<br>
with conventional mixing devices.<br>
The number of inlet openings 150A-150B, 250A-250C allow for the introduction<br>
of substances ("raw materials" or "reactants") to be mixed within the flexible mixing<br>
tank 100/200. Accordingly, each substance is introduced by its proper inlet opening to<br>
avoid the contact of one substance with another substance until a mix operation is to<br>
occur. As such, an embodimen: includes a kit, wherein the kit includes the flexible<br>
mixing tank 100/200 of the present invention. The kit also includes substances located in<br>
the different compartments 120/220. In an embodiment, the substances avoid contact<br>
with each other during the manufacturing, shipping, and storage of such flexible mixing<br>
tank 100/200.<br>
The outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C allow for the draining of the<br>
compartments 120A-120B, 220A-220C. While the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is<br>
illustrated with inlet openings that are separate from the outlet openings, embodiments of<br>
the invention are not so limited. Tor exampte, in an embodiment, a single opening could<br>
be in each of the given compartnents for inputting substances into the compartments,<br><br>
wherein at least one of such ope lings is also used to output the result of the admix<br>
operation performed based on rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200.<br>
In one embodiment, the number of inlet openings 15OA-15OB, 250A-250C and<br>
the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C include a base plate welded onto the<br>
internal or external face of the compartment 120/220 such that one end of the opening<br>
emerges inside the compartment 120/220 and the other end emerges outside the<br>
compartment 120/220. Furthermoie, the number of inlet openings 150A-150B, 250A-<br>
250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C may be closed using a number of<br>
devices, such as a tight plug. In one embodiment, the diameters of the number of inlet<br>
openings 150A-150B, 250A-250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C is<br>
dependent on the flow rate that the substance is to be introduced into the compartment<br>
120/220 and/or the admix operation that is to occur by rotation of the flexible mixing<br>
tank 100/200. For a gas substance, (he gas inlet and outlet rate (or pressure) may be such<br>
that there is a sufficient homogenization of the substances in the flexible mixing tank<br>
100/200.<br>
In an embodiment, at least one of the number of inlet openings 15OA-15OB,<br>
250A-250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C can be used to introduce<br>
different types of probes into the flexible mixing tank 100/200. For example, pH, pO2,<br>
temperature or pressure probes can be introduced into the flexible mixing tank 100/200<br>
through the number of inlet openings 150A-1 SOB, 250A-250C and the outlet openings<br>
160A-160B, 260A-260C to check the status of the substances and/or the result of the<br>
mixing of such substances within the flexible mixing tank 100/200.<br>
With regard to the substances to be stored, in the different compartments 120/220,<br>
such substances that are admixed (rrixed), at least partially together, during rotation of<br>
the flexible mixing tank 100/200 rw.y be in different phases (different types of solids,<br>
liquids and/or gases). For examph, the solid substances may be different types of<br>
powders. The liquid substances ituy be in different organic phases and/or aqueous<br>
phases. The gases may include oxygen, air, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, etc. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the substances are substantially homogenized. Moreover, the different<br>
substances may or may not be soluble in reference to each other.<br>
Any of a number of combinations of different substances in different phases can<br>
be admixed in accordance with embodiments of the invention. For example, a first<br>
substance in a solid phase may be mixed with a second substance in a solid phase. A<br>
first substance in a solid phase may be mixed with a second substance in a liquid phase.<br>
In one such embodiment, a powder is suspended in a liquid substance when the powder<br>
may be partially or totally insoluble in the liquid substance. In an embodiment wherein<br>
the powder is totally soluble, the operation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is such<br>
that the result is a homogenized solution of the powder and the liquid.<br>
Further, a first substance in a liquid phase may be mixed with a second substance<br>
in a liquid phase. In one embodiment, the first liquid substance may be partially soluble,<br>
totally soluble or totally insoluble with reference to the second liquid substance. If at<br>
least one liquid substance is at least partially insoluble in at least another liquid<br>
substance, an emulsion is obtained after the mixing/stirring of the flexible mixing tank<br>
100/200. In an embodiment, if the liquid substances are soluble in reference to each<br>
other, the operation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is such that the result is a<br>
homogenized solution of the two different liquid substances.<br>
A first substance in a liquid phase may be mixed with a second substance in a gas<br>
phase. The gas may be inert or miiy react with at least one component of the liquid<br>
substance. For example, a gas (that is relatively reactive under the desired conditions)<br>
may be oxygen or carbon dioxide w len culturing cells or microorganisms or to provide<br>
for an oxidation reaction.<br>
The width/diameter of a compartment 120/220 and the width/diameter of a<br>
connection 130/230 are dependent or the size of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. The<br>
width/diameter of the connection 30/230 is large enough to allow substances to<br>
efficiently enter and exit the compartments 120/220, while small enough to allow for<br>
efficient mixing of the substances in the different compartments 120/220. Specifically,<br><br>
the width/diameter of the connection 130/230 will be small enough to ensure that<br>
substances will contact one another when entering/exiting the compartments 120/220.<br>
In one embodiment, the ratio of the width/diameter of the connection 130/230 to<br>
the width/diameter of a compartment 120/220 is greater than 0.01. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, this ratio is in a range of about 0.01 to 1.0. In one embodiment, the ratio of<br>
the width/diameter of the connection 130/230 to the width/diameter of a compartment<br>
120/220 is less than 0.9. In an embodiment, the width/diameter of the connection<br>
130/230 is considerably smaller than the width/diameter of a compartment 120/220. For<br>
example, the ratio of the connection 130/230 to a compartment 120/220 is about 0.01 to<br>
about 0.7, about 0.05 to about 0.5, about 0.05 to about 0.25 or about 0.1 to about 0.2.<br>
In one embodiment, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 also includes one to a<br>
number of valves to allow for a relsase mechanism in the event that pressure builds up<br>
within the flexible mixing tank IOC/200 because of the mixing/rotation operation. The<br>
diameter of the connection 130/230 may be dependent on the types and characteristics of<br>
the substances to be mixed that are within the different compartments 120/220.<br>
Examples of the type of characteristics that the diameter of the connection 130/230 is<br>
dependent include viscosity, granulometry, density, thixotropy and rheoscopy. As<br>
described above, in one embodiment, a compartment 120/220 may be isolated from the<br>
other compartments 120/220 by closure of the passages through the connection 130/230,<br>
using for example, clips, clamps, flaps, etc. In one embodiment, a mesh or screen is<br>
located at the openings of the compartments 120/220 into the connection 130/230.<br>
Accordingly, when a solid substance is mixed with a liquid substance, the mesh or screen<br>
diminished the likelihood and/or severity of clogging at the openings into the connection<br>
130/230.<br>
Figures 3A-3C illustrate systems for mixing substances, according to<br>
embodiments of the invention. As shown, a system 300 includes the flexible mixing<br>
tank 100 and a mixing support 308. In the embodiment of the system 300, the mixing<br>
support 308 includes support sleeves 302A-302B. As shown, the support sleeve 302A<br><br>
and the support sleeve 302B cover the compartment 120A and the compartment 120B,<br>
respectively, and are on opposite sides of the connection 130. In an embodiment, the<br>
support sleeves 302A-302B are coupled to the compartments 120A-120B, respectively<br>
through one of a number of connection apparatus (e.g., a clip, a hook, etc.).<br>
Accordingly, the support sleves 302A-302B support the compartments 120A-120B to<br>
maintain a sufficient tension for the compartments 120A-120B during loading of the<br>
substances into the compartments 120A-120B as well as during mixing of the substances<br>
in the compartments 120A-120B based on rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100. As<br>
shown, in one embodiment, the system 300 includes a clamp 350 that precludes the<br>
mixing of the substances until the rotatioamix operation is to occur.<br>
In an embodiment, because of the flexibility of the flexible mixing tank 100, a<br>
low pressure gas is inserted into the flexible mixing tank 100 to support the<br>
compartments 120A-120B when placing the flexible mixing tank 100 into the mixing<br>
support 308 as well as during rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100. In one<br>
embodiment, the low pressure gas is a range of millibars. This gas may be inserted into<br>
the flexible mixing tank 100 through the number of inlet openings 150A-150B and the<br>
outlet openings 160A-160B.<br>
A mixing support for the flexible mixing apparatus 100 is not limited to the<br>
mixing support 308 illustrated in Figure 3A. In an embodiment, a mixing support<br>
includes a different type of support for assistance during rotation of the flexible mixing<br>
apparatus 100. For example, the mixing support may include a clip, a clamp, etc., that is<br>
located at different points on the flexible mix ing apparatus 100. Moreover, embodiments<br>
of the invention may include a combination of such mixing supports. For example, the<br>
mixing support may include the support sleeves 302A-302B and a clip to assist in the<br>
rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100.<br>
Figure 3B illustrates a system 310 that includes the flexible mixing tank 100 and<br>
the mixing support 308 (as described above for the system 300). The system 310 also<br>
includes a control apparatus 312 that is coupled to the mixing support 308 through a<br><br><br>
rotation handle 304. The rotation handle 304 may be coupled to the support sleeves<br>
302A-302B and/or to the flexible mixing tank 100. The control apparatus 312 may<br>
include a processor to execute machine-readable instructions for controlling the rotation<br>
of the flexible mixing tank 100, including the number of turns, the rate of rotation, how<br>
 far to turn for a given rotation (1/N of a 360° turn for N number of compartments 120),<br>
etc. (as described in more detail below in conjunction with the description of the flow<br>
diagram 500 of Figure 5).<br>
Figure 3C illustrates a system 395 that includes the flexible mixing tank 100 and<br>
the mixing support 308 (as described above for the system 300). The system 395 also<br>
 includes a mixing handle 390 that is coupled to the mixing support 308. The mixing<br>
handle 390 may be coupled to the support sleeves 302A-302B and/or to the flexible<br>
mixing tank 100. Accordingly an apparatus and/or individual may mix the substances in<br>
the flexible mixing tank 100 using the mixing handle 390 (as described in more detail<br>
below in conjunction with the description of the flow diagram 500 of Figure 5).<br>
	Figures 4A-4C illustrate systems for mixing substances, according to other<br>
embodiments of the invention. As shown, a system 400 includes the flexible mixing<br>
tank 200 and a mixing support 408. In the embodiment of the system 400, the mixing<br>
support 408 includes support sleeves 402A-402C. As shown, the support sleeve 402A,<br>
the support sleeve 402B and the support sleeve 402C cover the compartment 220A, thecompartment 220B and the compartment 22-OC, respectively, and are on different sides<br>
of the connection 230. In an emlodiment, the support sleeves 4O2A-402C are coupled to<br>
the compartments 220A-220C, respectively through one of a number of connection<br>
apparatus (e.g., a clip, a hook, etc.). Accordingly, the support sleeves 402A-402C<br>
support the compartments 220A-220C to maintain a sufficient tension for the<br>
compartments 220A-220C during loading of the substances into the compartments<br>
220A-220C and during mixing of the substances in the compartments 220A-220C based<br>
on rotation of the flexible mixing tank 200. As shown, in one embodiment, the system<br>
400 includes a number of clamps 450A-450C that preclude the mixing of the substances<br><br>
until the rotation/mix operation is to occur. The clamp 450A is coupled to preclude the<br>
substance in the compartment 220A from entering the connection 230. The clamp 450B<br>
is coupled to preclude the substance in the compartment 220B from entering the<br>
connection 230. The clamp 450C is coupled to preclude the substance in the<br>
 compartment 220C from entering the connection 230.<br>
In an embodiment, because of the flexibility of the flexible mixing tank 200, a<br>
low pressure gas is inserted into the flexible mixing tank 200 to support the<br>
compartments 220A-120C when placing the flexible mixing tank 200 into the mixing<br>
support 408 as well as during rotation of the flexible mixing tank 200. In one<br>
embodiment, the low pressure gas is in a range of 20-100 millibars. This gas may be<br>
inserted into the flexible miring tank 200 through the number of inlet openings 250A-<br>
250C and the outlet openings 260A-260C.<br>
A mixing support for the flexible mixing apparatus 200 is not limited to the<br>
mixing support 408 illustrated in Figure 4A. In one embodiment, a mixing support<br>
includes a different type of support for assistance during rotation of the flexible mixing<br>
apparatus 200. For example, the mixing support may include a clip, a clamp, etc., that is<br>
located at different points on the flexible mixing apparatus 200. Moreover, embodiments<br>
of the invention may include a combination of such mixing supports. For example, the<br>
mixing support may include the support sleeves 402A-402C and a clip to assist in the<br>
rotation of the flexible mixing tank 200.<br>
Figure 4B illustrates a system 410 that includes the flexible mixing tank 200 and<br>
the mixing support 408 (as described above for the system 400). The system 410 also<br>
includes a control apparatus 412 that is coupled to the mixing support 408 through a<br>
rotation handle 404. The rotation handle 404 may be coupled to the support sleeves<br>
402A-402C and/or to the flexible mixing tank 200. The control apparatus 412 may<br>
include a processor to execute machine-readable instructions for controlling the rotation<br>
of the flexible mixing tank 200, including the number of turns, the rate of rotation, how<br>
far to turn for a given rotation (1/N of a 360° turn for N number of compartments 220),<br><br>
etc. (as described in more detail below in conjunction with the description of the flow<br>
diagram 500 of Figure 5).<br>
Figure 4C illustrates a system 495 that includes the flexible mixing tank 200 and<br>
the mixing support 408 (as described above for the system 400). The system 495 also<br>
includes a mixing handle 490 that is coupled to the mixing support 408. The mixing<br>
handle 490 may be coupled to the support sleeves 402A-402C and/or to the flexible<br>
mixing tank 200. Accordingly, an apparatus and/or individual may mix the substances in<br>
the flexible mixing tank 200 using the mixing handle 490 (as described in more detail<br>
below in conjunction with the description of the flow diagram 500 of Figure 5).<br>
Figure S illustrates a flow diagram for mixing substances, according to an<br>
embodiment of the invent on. The flow diagram 500 illustrates the operations of the<br>
flexible mixing tank 100/200, according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
In block 502, passages for the compartments 120/220 into the connection<br>
130/230 of the flexible miring tank 100/200 are closed. A number of clamps may be<br>
used to close the passages for the compartments 120/220. As described above, at least<br>
one of the passages for the compartments 120/220 into the connection 130/230 are closed<br>
in order to isolate a substance in one of the compartments 120/220 from the substances in<br>
the other compartments 120/220. This closure of the passages allows the mixing of two<br>
or more substances during rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200, while isolating<br>
one or more other substances. Subsequently, these closed passages may be opened in an<br>
order that is in accord with a mixing protocol for the substances to be loaded into the<br>
compartments 120/220. For example, a more homogenous solution may be derived for<br>
three substances if a first substance and a second substance are mixed, followed by the<br>
mixing of the third substance into the mixture of the first substance and the second<br>
substance. Control continues at block 504.<br>
In block 504, substarces are loaded into the compartments 120/220 of the flexible<br>
mixing tank 100/200. The substances are loaded into the compartments 120/220 through<br>
the number of inlet openings 150A-150Ei, 250A-250C. As described above, the number<br><br><br>
of inlet openings 150A-150B, 250A-250C allow for the introduction of substances ("raw<br>
materials" or "reactants") to be mixed within the flexible mixing tank 100/200.<br>
Accordingly, each substance is introduced by its proper inlet opening to avoid the<br>
contact of one substance with another substance until a mix operation is to occur.<br>
Control continues at block 506.<br>
The open passage operation is described in block 506, and the mix operation is<br>
described in block 508. While described such that the operations of the block 508 are<br>
subsequent to the operations of the block 506, embodiments arc not so limited. For<br>
example, as described above, different passages may be opened at different times during<br>
the mixing of the substances in order to follow a mix protocol for a given set of<br>
substances. Accordingly, the opening of a passage may follow a first mix operation,<br>
which is followed by a second mix operation.<br>
In block 506, the passages (that are closed) are opened in an order that is based<br>
on a mixing protocol for the loaded substances. In one embodiment, all of the passages<br>
are opened. In an embodi ment, less than all of the passages are opened, thereby leaving<br>
one or more substances in isolation during a first mix operation based on a mix protocol<br>
for the given set of substarces (as described above). Control continues at block 508.<br>
In block 508, the substances loaded into the compartments 120/220 are mixed, at<br>
least partially, based on rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. The mixing of the<br>
substances may be performed by an individual and/or the control apparatus 312/412<br>
(shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4). The mixing of the substances may be carried out by a<br>
number of rotations of the flexible mixing tank 100/200, wherein one rotation includes<br>
rotating at least 1/N of a 360° turn (wherein N is the number of compartments). In one<br>
embodiment, the rotation s in a given plane that includes the compartments 120/220.<br>
The rotation is around the center of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. In embodiment,<br>
the center of rotation is at the gravity center of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. This<br>
gravity center may be the gravity center of the connection 130/230. In an embodiment,<br><br><br>
the gravity center corresponds to the symmetrical center of the flexible mixing tank<br>
100/200.<br>
In one embodiment, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is placed in an<br>
approximately vertical position, thereby enabling the mixing of the substances based on<br>
gravity during the rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. Therefore, at Jeast a part<br>
of the component contained in one of the compartments 120/220 is transferred by gravity<br>
to at least one other compartment upon rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200. In<br>
an embodiment to generate a homogenous solution, the rotation of the flexible mixing<br>
tank 100/200 continues until the substances are approximately homogenized. In an<br>
embodiment that includes z liquid and a powder that is at least partially insoluble, the<br>
rotation of the flexible mixing tank 100/200 continues until the powder is suspended in<br>
the liquid.<br>
Moreover, as described above, a number of open passage operations and mix<br>
operations may occur in order to follow a given mix protocol. Accordingly, a number of<br>
mix operations may occur until the different substances are mixed, at least partially, into<br>
the final resulting substance. Control continues at block 510.<br>
In block 510, the at least partially mixed substances are drained from the flexible<br>
mixing tank 100/200. In an embodiment, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is positioned<br>
such that when a plug is removed from one of one of the number of inlet openings 150A-<br>
150B, 250A-250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C gravity is used to<br>
drain the at least partially mixed substances from the flexible mixing tank 100/200.<br>
Further, the drain operation may be facilitated. For example, when the substance is a<br>
viscous solution having a slow flow, the drain operation may be facilitated through a<br>
number of operations. In an embodiment, the drain operation is facilitated by an increase<br>
in pressure initiated by introducing a gas into one of the number of inlet openings 150A-<br>
150B, 250A-250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C. In one<br>
embodiment, the drain operation may be facilitated by a flattening device (such as a<br>
rolling pin).<br><br>
In an embodiment, an aspiration cane is used (through one of the number of inlet<br>
openings 150A-150B, 250A-250C and the outlet openings 160A-160B, 260A-260C) to<br>
drain the at least partially mixed substances from the flexible mixing tank 100/200. In<br>
one such embodiment, the compartment from which the draining occurs is at a higher<br>
height than that of the other compartments. In one embodiment, a pump coupled to a<br>
conduit is coupled to one of the number of inlet openings 150A-150B, 250A-250C and<br>
the outlet openings 160A-160B to facilitate the drain operation by pumping gas (such as<br>
air) into the flexible mixing tank 100/200. Control continues at block 512.<br>
In block 512, the flexible mixing tank 100/200 is discarded. In particular, the<br>
flexible mixing tank 100/200 is discarded after a single use. Accordingly, the<br>
washing/sterilizing operations as well as the maintenance associated with convention<br>
mixing devices are not needed. Moreover, as described, embodiments of the invention<br>
reduce the amount of human contact with the substances (which may be hazardous, <br>
dangerous and/or infectious) that are to be mixed as part of and during the mixing of<br>
such substances.<br>
Thus, a method, apparatus and system for different embodiments for mixing<br>
solids, liquids and/or gases have been described. Although the present invention has<br>
been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that<br>
various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing<br>
from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. For example, while embodiments<br>
illustrated herein include a two-compartment and three-compartment flexible mixing<br>
tank, a greater number of compartments may be incorporated into a flexible mixing tank<br>
in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Therefore, the specification and<br>
drawings are to be regarded n an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.<br><br>

(135A, 135B, 235A, 235B, 235C) and comprises a proximal end (136A, 136B,<br>
236A, 236B, 236C), coupled to the flexible conduit (130,230) such that the<br>
flexible conduit 130,230) defines a passageway arranged to permit<br>
substances to flow between the two or more flexible compartments (120A,<br>
120B, 220A, 220B, 220C), wherein a diameter of the storage area at the<br>
proximal end (135A, 135B, 235A, 235B,235C) is less than a diameter of the<br>
storage area at the distal end (136A,136B, 236A, 236B, 236C) and wherein<br>
each flexible compartment (120A, 120B, 220A, 220B, 220C) is angularly and<br>
substantially symmetrically spaced apart about the flexible conduit (130,<br>
230) to permit flow of material from one flexible compartment (120A, 120B,<br>
220A, 220B, 220C) through the flexible conduit (130,230) to another flexible<br>
compartment (120A, 120B, 220A, 220B, 220C) upon rotation of the apparatus<br>
(100,200).</td>
