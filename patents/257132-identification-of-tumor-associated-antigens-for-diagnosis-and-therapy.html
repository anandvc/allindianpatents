Identification   of   t-vunor-associated   antigens   for diagnosis and therapy<br>
Despite interdiscipliDary approaches and exhaustive use of classical therapeutic procedures, cancers are still among the leading causes of death. More recent therapeutic concepts aim at incorporating the patient's immune system into the overall therapeutic concept by using recombinant tumor vaccines and other specific measures such as antibody therapy. A prerequisite for the success of such a strategy is the recognition of tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens or epitopes by the patient's immune system whose effector functions are to be interventionally enhanced. Tumor cells biologically differ substantially from their nonmalignant cells of origin. These differences are due to genetic alterations acquired during tumor development and result, inter alia, also in the formation of qualitatively or quantitatively altered molecular structures in the cancer cells. Tumor-associated structures of this kind which are recognized by the specific immune system of the tumor-harboring host are referred to as tumor-associated antigens. The specific recognition of tumor-associated antigens involves cellular and humoral mechanisms which are two functionally interconnected units: CD4+ and CDS+ T lymphocytes recognize rhe processed antigens presented on the molecules of the MHC (major histocompatibiliry complex) classes II and I, respectively, while B lymphocytes produce circulating antibody molecules which bind directly to unprocessed antigens, The potential clinical-therapeutical importance of tumor-associated antigens results from the fact that the recognition of antigens on neoplasric cells by rhe immune system leads to the initiation of cytotoxic effector mechanisms and, in the presence of T helper<br><br>
cells, can cause elimination of the cancer cells (Pardoll, Nat. Med. 4:525-31, 1998). Accordingly, a central aim of tumor  immunology is to molecular!y define these structures. The molecular narure of these antigens has been enigmatic for a long time. Only after development of appropriate cloning techniques has it been possible to screen cDNA expression libraries of tumors systematically for tumor-associated antigens by analyzing the target structures of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (van der Bruggen et al.. Science 254:1643^7, 1991) or by using circulating autoantibodies (Sahin et al,, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 9:709-16, 1997) as probes. To this end, cDNA expression libraries were prepared from fresh tumor tissue and recombinantly expressed as proteins in suitable systems. Immunoeffectors isolated from patients, namely CTL clones with tumor-specific lysis patterns, or circulating autoantibodies were utilized for cloning the respective antigens.<br>
In recent years a multiplicity of antigens have been defined in various neoplasias by these approaches.<br>
However, the probes utilized for antigen identification in the classical methods are immunoeffectors (circulating autoantibodies or CTL clones) from patients usually having already advanced cancer. A number of data indicate that tumors can lead, for example, to tolerization and anergization of T cells ana that, during the course of the disease, especially those specificities which could cause effective immune recognition are lost from the immunoeffector repertoire. Current patient studies have not yet produced any solid evidence of a real action of the previously found and utilized tumor-associated antigens. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that proteins evoking spontaneous immune responses are the wrong target structures.<br><br>
It was the object of the present invention to provide target  structures  tor  a  diagnosis  and  therapy  of<br>
cancers.<br>
This object is achieved by the subject matter of the<br>
claims.<br>
According to the invention genes are identified which are selectively or aberrantly expressed in tumor cells and thus, provide tumor-associated antigens. These genes and/or their genetic products and/or the derivatives and/or fragments thereof are useful as target structures for therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.<br>
The tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention have an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid which is selected from the group consisting of (a) a nucleic acid which comprises a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 28, 30, 35, 39, 41, 45, 49, 61, 62, and 64-67 of the sequence listing, a part or derivative thereof, (b) a nucleic acid which hybridizes with the nucleic acid of (a) under stringent conditions, (c) a nucleic acid which is degenerate with respect to the nucleic acid of (a) or (b) , and (d) a nucleic acid which is complementary to the nucleic acid of (a) , (b) or (c) , In a preferred embodiment, a tumor-associated ant i aen identified according ro the invention has an ammo acio sequence encoded by a nucleic acid which is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 28, 30, 35, 39, 41, 45, 49, 61, 62, and 64-67 of the sequence listing. In a further preferred embodiment, a tumor-associated antigen identified according to the invention comprises an amino acid sequence selected from tne group consisting ot St^Q ID NOs: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 29, 31, 36, 40, 42, 46, 50-60, 63, 68, and 69 of the sequence listing, a part<br><br>
or derivative thereof.<br>
Tho present invention general1y relates to the use of tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or of parts or derivatives thereof; of nucleic acids coding for the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or of parts or derivatives thereof or of nucleic acids directed against said coding nucleic acids, of antibodies or T cells directed against the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof and/or of host cells expressing the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring of neoplastic diseases. This may also involve the use of a combination of two or more of these antigens, nucleic acids, antibodies, T cells and/or host cells, in one embodiment also in combination with tumor-associated antigens other than those identified according to the invention, nucleic acids coding therefor or nucleic acids directed against said coding nucleic acids, antibodies or T cells directed against said tumor-associated antigens and/or host cells expressing said tumor associated antigens.<br>
In those embodiments of the invention relating to the use of antibodies directed against the tumor-associated<br>
antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives rhereof also T cell receptors directed against the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof, optionally in a complex with MHC molecules, may be used.<br>
Especially suitable for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring is a part of rhe tumor-associateo antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds  to  the  non-transmembrane  portion,  in<br><br>
particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof. Therefore, arcordinq to the invention, a part of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds to the non-transmembrane portion, in particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof, or a corresponding part of the nucleic acids coding for the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention is preferred for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring. Similarly the use of antibodies is preferred which are directed against a part of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds to the non-transmembrane portion, in particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof.<br>
Preferred diseases for a therapy, prophylaxis and/or diagnosis are those in which one or more of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention are selectively expressed or abnormally expressed.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to nucleic acids and proteins or peptides, which result from altered splicing (splice variants) of known genes or altered translation using alternative open reading frames. In<br>
this aspect the invention relates to nucleic acids which comprise a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 28 and 49 of the sequence listing. Moreover, in this aspect, the invetion relates to proteins or peptides which comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 50 of the sequence listing.<br>
Altered splicing of a gene results in an altered transcript sequence (splice variant). Translation of a<br><br>
splice variant in the region of its altered sequence results in an altered protein which may be distinctly<br><br>
original protein. Tumor-associated splice variants may produce tumor-associated transcripts and tumor-associated proteins/antigens. These may be utilized as molecular markers both for detecting tumor cells and for therapeutic targeting of tumors . Detection of tumor cells in a sample from a patient may be carried out according to the invention for example, after extraction of nucleic acids by PCR amplification with splice variant-specific oligonucleotides.<br>
According to the invention, all sequence^dependent detection systems are suitable for detection. These are, apart from PCR, for example gene chip/microarray systems, Northern blot, RNAse protection assays (RDA) and others. All detection systems have in common that detection is based on a specific hybridization with at least one splice variant-specific nucleic acid sequence. However, tumor cells may also be detected according to the invention by antibodies which recognize a specific epitope encoded by the splice variant. Said antibodies may be prepared by using for immunization peptides which are specific for said splice variant. Suitable for immunization are particularly the amino acid sequences which are distinctly different from the variant(s) of the genetic Droduct, which is fare oreferablv produced in healthv cells. Detection of the tumor cells with antibodies may be carried out here on a sample isolated from the patient or as imaging with intravenously administered antibodies.<br>
In addition to diagnostic usability, splice variants having new or altered epitopes are attractive targets for immunotherapy as these epitopes may be utilized for targeting antibodies or T lymphocytes as described herein.  In  passive  immunotherapy,  antibodies  or  T<br><br>
lymphocytes which recognize splice variant-specific epitopes are adoptively transferred here.  As in the<br>
case of other ant i a ens, antibodies may be generated also by using standard technologies with utilization of polypeptides which include these epi,topes. Alternatively it is possible to utilize for immunization nucleic acids coding for peptides which contain said epitopes. Various techniques for in vitro or in vivo generation of epitope-specific T lymphocytes are known and have been described in detail (for example Kessler JH, et al. 2001, Sahin et al, , 1997) and are likewise based on utilizing peptides which contain the splice variant-specific epitopes or nucleic acids coding for said peptides. Peptides which contain the splice variant-specific epitopes or nucleic acids coding for said peptides may also be used as pharmaceutically active substances in active immunotherapy (e.g. vaccination, vaccine therapy),<br>

Nucleic acids comprise according to the invention genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA, recombinantly produced and chemically synthesized molecules, According to the invention, a nucleic acid may be present as a single-stranded or double-stranded and linear or covalently circularly closed molecule.<br>
As used herein, the term "RNA" means a molecule comprising at least one ribonucleotide residue. By "ribonucleotide" is meant a nucleotide with a hydroxyl group at the 2'-position of a beta-D-ribo-furanose moiety. The term includes double stranded RNA, single stranded RNA, isolated RNA such as partially purified RNA, essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA, as well as altered RNA that differs from naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion, substitution and/or alteration of one or more nucleotides. Such alterations can include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as to the end(s) of a RNA or internally, for example at one or more nucleotides of the RNA, Nucleotides in RNA molecules can also comprise non-standard nucleotides/ such as non-naturally occurring nucleotides or chemically synthesized nucleosides or deoxynucleotides, These altered RNAs can be referred to as analogs or analogs of naturally-occurring RNA.<br><br>

nucleic acid" means according to Lhe invention that the nucleic acid was (i) amplified in vitro, for example by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning, (iii) purified, for example by cleavage and gel-electrophoretic fractionation, or (iv) synthesized, for example by chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is a nucleic acid which is available for manipulation by recombinant DNA techniques-<br>
A nucleic acid is "complementary" to another nucleic acid if the two sequences are capable of hybridizing and forming a stable duplex with one another, with hybridization preferably being carried out under conditions which allow specific hybridization between polynucleotides (stringent conditions), Stringent conditions are described, for example, in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook et al.. Editors, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press. Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989 or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F,M. Ausubel et al,, Editors, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York and refer, for example, to hybridization at 65"C in hybridization buffer (3-5 x SBC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 2-5 mM NaHzPO. (pH 7), 0.5% SDS, 2 rm EDTA). SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0,15 M sodium citrate, pH 7. After hybridization, the membrane to which the DNA has been transferred is washed, for example, in 2 x SSC at room temperature and then in 0.1-0.5 x SSC/0,1 x SDS at temperatures of up to 68°C.<br>
According to the invention, complementary nucleic acids have at least 40%, in particular at ieast 50%, at, ieast 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% and preferably at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99%,<br><br>
identical nucleotides.<br>
The term 'percent a qe identity" is intended to denote a percentage ot nucleotides or of amnio acid residues which are identical between the two sequences to be compared, obtained after the best alignment, this percentage being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being distributed randomly and over their entire length. Sequence comparisons between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are conventionally carried out by comparing these sequences after having aligned them optimally, said comparison being carried out by segment or by "window of comparison" in order to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. The optimal alignment of the sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 4 82, by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P, BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.).<br>
The percentage identity is calculated by determining the number of identical positions between the two sequences being compared, dividing this number by the<br>
number of positions compared and multiplying the result obtained by lOO so as to obtain the percentage identity between these two sequences.<br>
Nucleic acids coding for tumor-associated antigens may.<br><br>
according to the invention, be present alone or in combination with  other  nucleic  acids,  in  particular<br><br>
nucleic acid is functionally linked to expression control sequences or regulatory sequences which may be homologous or heterologous with respect to said nucleic acid. A coding sequence and a regulatory sequence are 'functionally" linked to one another, if they are covalently linked to one another in such a way that expression or transcription of said coding sequence is under the control or under the influence of said regulatory sequence. If the coding sequence is to be translated into a functional protein, then, with a regulatory sequence functionally linked to said coding sequence, induction of said regulatory sequence results in transcription of said coding sequence, without causing a frame shift in the coding sequence or said coding sequence not being capable of being translated into the desired protein or peptide.<br>
The term "expression control sequence" or ^'regulatory sequence" comprises according to the invention promoters, enhancers and other control elements which regulate   expression  of   a   gene.   In   particular<br>
embodiments of the invention, the expression control sequences can be regulated. The exact structure of regulatory sequences may vary as a function of the species  or  cell  type,   but  generally  comprises<br>
5'untranscribed and 5'untranslated sequences which are involved in initiatiion of rranscription anc translation, respectively, such as TATA' box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like More specifically, 5 untranscribed regulatory sequences comprise a promoter region which includes a promoter seauence for transcriptional control of the functionally linked gene. Regulatory sequences may also comprise enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences.<br><br>
According to the invention a nucleic acid may furthermore  be  present  in  combination  with  another<br><br>
secretion of the protein or peptide encoded by said nucleic acid from a host cell. According to- the invention, a nucleic acid may also be present in combination with another nucleic acid which codes for a peptide causing the encoded protein or peptide to be anchored on the cell membrane of the host cell or compartmentalized into particular, organelles of said cell ■ Similarly, a combination with a nucleic acid is possible which represents a reporter gene or any 'tag",<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule is according to the invention a vector, where appropriate with a promoter, which controls expression of a nucleic acid, for example a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen identified according to the invention. The term ^'vector" is used here in its most general meaning and comprises any intermediary vehicle for a nucleic acid which enables said nucleic acid, for example, to be introduced into prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells and, where appropriate, to be integrated into a genome. Vectors of this kind are preferably replicated and/or expressed in the cells, An intermediary vehicle may be adapted, for example, to the use in electroporation, in bombardment with microprojectiles, in liposomal administration, in the transfer with the aid of agrobacteria or in insertion via DNA or RKA viruses.

application.<br><br>
relates to any cell which can be transformed or transfected with an exogenous nucleic acid. The term 'host cells" comprises according to the invention prokaryotic (e.g. E. coii) or eukaryotic cells (e.g. dendritic cells, B cells, CHO cells, COS cells, K5 62 cells, yeast cells and insect cells) . Particular preference is given to mammalian cells such as cells from humans, mice, hamsters, pigs, goats, primates. The cells may be derived from a multiplicity of tissue types and comprise primary cells and cell lines, Specific examples comprise keratinocytes, peripheral blood leukocytes, stem cells of the bone marrow and embryonic stem cells, In further embodiments, the host cell is an antigen-presenting cell, in particular a. dendritic cell, monocyte or a macrophage. A nucleic acid may be present in the host cell in the form of a single copy or of two or more copies and, in one embodiment, is expressed in the host cell.<br>
According to the invention, the term "expression' is used in its most general meaning and comprises the production of RNA or of RNA and protein. It also comprises partial expression of nucleic acids. Furthermore, expression may be carried out transiently or stably- Preferred expression systems in mammalian eel Is comprise pcDNA3.1 and pRc/CMV (Invit rogen, Carlsbad, CA; , which contain a selectable marker such as a gene imparting resistance to G418 (and thus enabling stably transfeeted cell lines to be selected) and the enhancer-promoter sequences of cytomegalovirus (CMV).<br>
In those cases of the invention in which a MHC molecule presents a tumor-associated antigen or a part thereof^ an expression vector may also comprise a nucleic acid sequence coding for said MHC molecule. The nucleic acid<br><br>
sequence coding for the MHC molecule may be present on the same expression vector as the nucleic acid coding<br><br>
or both nucleic aci ds may be present on ditterent expression vectors. In the latter case, the two expression vectors may be cotransfected into a cell - If a host cell expresses neither the tumor-associated antigen or the part thereof nor the MHC molecule both nucleic acids coding therefor may be transfected into the cell either on the same expression vector or on different expression vectors. If the cell already expresses the MHC molecule, only the nucleic acid sequence coding for the tumor-associated antigen or the part thereof can be transfected into the cell.<br>
The invention also comprises kits for amplification of a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen-Such kits comprise, for example, a pair of amplification primers which hybridize to the nucleic acid coding for the tumor-associated antigen. The primers preferably comprise a sequence of 6-50, in particular 10-30, 15-30 and 20-30 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleic acid and are nonoverlapping, in order to avoid the formation of primer dimers. One of the primers will hybridize to one strand of the nucleic acid coding for the tumor-associated antigen, and the other primer will hybridise to the complementary strand in an arrangement which allows<br><br>
associated anrigen.<br>
"'Antisense molecules" or "'antisense nucleic acids" may be used for regulating, in particular reducing, expression of a nucleic acid. The term 'antisense mclecule" or 'antisense nucleic acid" refers according to the invention to an oligonucleotide which is an oligoribonucleotide, oligoaeoxyribonucleoride, moaifiea oligoribonucleotide or modified oligo-deoxyribonucleotide   and   which   hybridizes   under<br><br>
physiological conditions to DNA comprising a particular gene  or  to  mRNA  of  said  gene,  thereby  inhibiting<br><br>
mRNA. According to the invention, an 'antisense molecule" also comprises a construct which contains a nucleic acid or a part thereof in reverse orientation with respect to its natural promoter. An antisense transcript of a nucleic acid . or of a part thereof may form a duplex with the naturally occurring mRNA specifying the enzyme and thus prevent accumulation of or translation of the mRNA into the active enzyme. Another possibility is the use of ribozymes for inactivating a nucleic acid. Antisense oligonucleotides preferred according to the invention have a sequence of 6-50, in particular 10-30, 15-30 and 20-30, contiguous nucleotides of the target nucleic acid and preferably are fully complementary to the target nucleic acid or to a part thereof.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes with an N-terminal or 5' upstream site such as a translation initiation site, transcription initiation site or promoter site. In further embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes with a 3'untranslated region or mRNA splicing site.<br>
In one embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention consists of ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides or a<br>
combination thereof; with the 5 end of one nucleotide and the 3' end of another nucleotiae being linjked to one another by a phosphodiester bond. These oligonucleotides may be synthesized in the conventional manner or produced recombinantly.<br>
In preferred embodiments, an oligonucleotide of the invention is. a 'modified" oligonucleotide. Here, rhe oligonucleotide may be modified in very aifferent ways, without impairing its ability to bind its target, in order  to  increase,  for  example,  its  stability  or<br><br><br>
The term ^'modified oligonucleotide" also comprises oligonucleotides having a covalently modified base and/or sugar, "Modified oligonucleotides" comprise, for example^ oligonucleotides with sugar residues which are covalently bound to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 3 position and a phosphate group at the 5' position. Modified oligonucleotides may comprise, for example, a 2'-0-alkylated ribose residue or another sugar instead of ribose, such as arabinose.<br>
It is to be understood that all embodiments described above with respect to oligonucleotides may also apply to polynucleotides.<br><br><br><br>
One or both strands of the siRNA can also comprise a 3'-overhang. As used herein, a "3'-overhang" refers to at least one unpaired nucleotide extending from the 3'-end of an RNA strand. Thus in one embodiment; the siRNA comprises at least one 3' -overhang of from 1 to about 6 nucleotides (which includes ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides) in lencth ,, preferably from 1 to about 5 nucleotides m length, more preferably from 1 zo about 4 nucleotides in length, and particularly preferably from about 2 to about 4 nucleotides in length. In the embodiment in which both s'trands of che siRNA molecule comprise a 3'-overhang, the length of the overhangs can be the same or different for each strand. In a most preferred embodiment, the 3'-overhang is present on both strands of the siRNA, and is 2 nucleotides in length. For example, each strand of the<br><br>
siRNA of the invention can comprise 3'-overhangs of dideoxythymidylic  acid  ("TT")   or  diuridylic  acid<br>
In order to enhance the stability of the siRNA, the 3'-Qverhangs can be also stabilized against degradation. In one embodiment^ the overhangs are stabilized by including purine nucleotides, such as adenosine or guanosine nucleotides. Alternatively, substitution of pyrimidine nucleotides by modified analogues, e.g., substitution of uridine nucleotides in the 3'-overhangs with 2'-deoxythymidine, is tolerated and does not affect the efficiency of RNAi degradation. In particular, the absence of a 2'-hydroxyl in the 2*-deoxythymidine significantly enhances the nuclease resistance of the 3'-overhang in tissue culture medium.<br>
The sense and antisense strands of the siRNA can comprise two complementary, single-stranded RNA molecules or can comprise a single molecule in which two complementary portions are base-paired and are covalently linked by a single-stranded "hairpin" area. That is, the sense region and antisense region can be covalently connected via a linker molecule. The linker molecule can be a polynucleotide or non--nucleotide linker. Without wishina to be bound by anv theory, it IS believed that rhe hairpin area of the iatrer type of siRNA molecule is cleaved intraeellularly by the "Dicer" protein (or its equivalent) to form a siRNA of two individual base-paired RNA molecules.<br>
As used herein, "target mRNA" refers to an RNA molecule that is a target for downregulation.<br><br>
siRNA can be expressed from pol III expression vectors without a change in targeting site,  as expression of<br><br>
siRNA according to the invention can be targeted to any stretch of approximately 19-25 contiguous nucleotides in any of the target mRNA sequences (the "target sequence"). Techniques for selecting target sequences for siRNA are given, for example;, in Tuschl T, et al., "The siRNA User Guide", revised Oct. 11, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. "The siRNA User Guide" is available on the world wide. web at &amp; website maintained by Dr. Thomas Tuschl, Laboratory of RNA Molecular Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, USA, and can be found by accessing the website of the Rockefeller University and searching with the keyword 'siRNA"* Thus, the sense strand of the present siRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence substantially identical to any contiguous stretch of about 19 to about 2 5 nucleotides in the target mRNA.<br>
Generally, a target sequence on the target mRNA can be<br><br>
the targei: mRNA, preferably beginning 50 to 100 nt downstream (i.e., in the 3'-direction) from the start codon. The target sequence can, however, be located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions, or in the region nearby the start codon.<br>
siRNA can be obtained using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, siRNA can be chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced<br><br><br>
Preferably, siRNA is chemically synthesized using appropriately protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer. siRNA can be synthesized as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.<br>
Alternatively, siRNA can also be expressed from recombinant circular or linear DNA plasmids using any suitable promoter. Such embodiments are included according to the present invention when reference is made herein " to the administration of siRNA or the incorporation of siRNA into pharmaceutical compositions. Suitable promoters for expressing siRNA of the invention from a plasmid include, for example, the U6 or HI RNA pol III promoter sequences and the cytomegalovirus promoter.<br>
Selection	of other suitable promoters is within , the<br>
skill in	the art.  The recombinant plasmids of the<br>
inventior can  also comprise indijcible or  regulatable<br>
promoters	for expression of the siRNA in a pamicuiar<br>
tissue or	in a particular intracellular environment .<br>
The siRNA expressed from recombinant plasmids can either be isolated from cultured cell expression systems by standard techniques, or can be expressed intracellularly. The use of recombinant plasmias 1:0 deliver siRNA to cells in vivo is discussed in more detail below. siRNA can be expressed from a recombinant<br><br><br>
Selection of plasmids suitable for expressing siRNA, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the siRNA into the plasmid, and methods of delivering the recombinant plasmid to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art,<br>
siRNA can also be expressed from recombinant viral vectors intracellularly in vivo. The recombinant viral vectors comprise sequences encoding the siRNA and any suitable promoter for expressing the siRNA sequences. The recombinant viral vectors can also comprise inducible or regulatable promoters for expression of the siRNA in a particular tissue or in a particular intracellular environment. siRNA can be expressed from a recombinant viral vector either as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.<br>

Preferably,-   the  proteins  and  peptides  described<br><br>
according to the invention have been isolated. The terms  'isolated protein' or 'isolated peptide" mean<br>
natural environment. An isolated protein or peptide may be in an essentially purified state. The term "essentially purified" means that the protein or peptide is essentially free of other substances with which it is associated in nature or in vivo.<br>
Such proteins and peptides may be used, for example, in producing antibodies and in an immunological or diagnostic assay or as therapeutics. Proteins and peptides described according to the invention may be isolated from biological samples such as tissue or cell homogenates and may also be expressed recombinantly in a multiplicity of pro- or eukaryotic expression systems.<br>

having an insertion, one or more amino acid residues are inserteG into a particular site in an amino acid sequence, although random insertion with appropriate screening of the resulting product is also possible. Amino acid deletion variants are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acids from the sequence. Amino acid substitution variants are characterized by at least one residue in the sequence being removed and another residue being inserted m its place. Preference is given to the modifications being in positions in the amino acid sequence which are not conserved between<br><br><br>
Owing to their particular part in protein architecture, three residues are shown in brackets. Gly is the only residue without a side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain. Pro has an unusual geometry which greatly restricts the chain. Cys can form a disulfide bridge,<br>
The amino acid variants described above may be readily prepared with the aid of known peptide synthesis techniques  such  as  for  example,  by  solid  phase<br>
svn thesis (Merrifield, 1964) and similar methods or by recombinant DNA manipulation. The manipulation of DNA sequences for preparing proteins and peptides having substitutions r insertions or deletions, is described in detail in Sambrook ez  al,    (1989), for example.<br>
According to the invention, 'derivatives" of proteins and peptides also comprise single or multiple substitutions, deletions ana/or aaditions of any molecules associated with the protein or peptide, such as carbohydrates, lipids and/or proteins or peptides.<br><br>

A part or a fragment: of a nucleic acia coaing for a tumor-associated antigen relates according to the invention to the part of the nucleic acid, which codes<br><br>
at least for the tumor-associated antigen and/or for a part or a fragment of said tumor-associated antigen, as<br>
coding for a tumor-associated antigen is preferably that part of the nucleic acid corresponding to the open reading frame,<br>
According to the invention^ particular embodiments ought to involve providing "dominant negative" proteins or peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens. A dominant negative protein or peptide is an inactive protein or peptide variant which, by way of interacting with the cellular machinery displaces an active protein or peptide from its interaction with the cellular machinery or which competes with the active protein or peptide^ thereby reducing the effect of said active protein.<br>
Antisera which contain specific antibodies specifically binding to the target protein can be prepared by various standard processes; see for example, ''Monoclonal Antibodies; A Practical Approach" by Philip Shepherd, Christopher Dean ISBN 0-19-963722-9; 'Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual" by Ed Harlow, David Lane, ISBN: 087 9693142 and 'Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual: Portable Protocol NO" by Edward Harlow, David Lane, Ed Harlow ISBN 0879695447, Thereby it is also possible to generate affine and specific antibodies which recognize complex membrane protei ns in their native form (Azorsa etal., J. Immunol. MeL.hods 22 9: 35-4 8, 1999; Anderson et al. , J. Immunol. 143: 18 99-1904, 1989; Gardsvoll, J. Immunol. Methods 234: 107-116, 2000). This is in particular relevant for the preparation of antibodies which are zo be used therapeutically, .but also for many diagnostic applications. In this respect, it is possible to immunize with the whole protein, with extracellular partial sequences as well as with cells which express the target molecule in physiologically folded form.<br><br><br>
It is known that only a small part of an antibody<br>
molecule, the paratope, is involved in binding of the<br>
antibody to its epitope (of. Clark, W.R. (1986) , The<br>
Experimental Foundations of Modern Immunology, Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, Inc., New York; Roitt, I. (1991), Essential<br>
Immunology,	7th   Edition,    Blackwell   Scientific<br>
Publications, Oxford). The pFc' and Fc regions are, for example, effectors of the complement cascade but are not involved in antigen binding. An antibody from which the pFc' region has been enzymatically removed or which has been produced without the pFc' region, referred to as F{ab')2 fragment, carries both antigen binding sites of a complete antibody. Similarly, an antibody from which the Fc region has been enzymatically removed or which has been produced without said Fc region, referred to as Fab fragment, carries one antigen binding site of an intact antibody molecule. Furthermore, Fab fragments consist of a covalently bound light chain .of an antibody and oart of the heavy-chain or said antibody referreo LO as Fc. Tne r'c fragments are the main determinants of antibody specificity (a single Fd fragment can be associated with up to ren different light chains, without altering the specificity of the antibody) and Fd fragments, when isolated, retain the ability to bind to an epitope.<br>
Located within the antigen-binding part 01 an antiboay are complementary-determining regions (CDRs) which interact  directly  with  the  antigen  epitope  and<br><br><br>
determining regions (CDRl to CDR3) . The CDRs and, in particular, the CDR3 regions and, still more particularly the CDRS region of the heavy chain are responsible to a large extent for antibody specificity*<br>
Non-CDR regions of a mammalian antibody are icnown to be able to be replaced by similar regions of antibodies with the same or a different specificity, with the specificity for the epitope of the original antibody being retained. This made possible the development of '"humanized" antibodies in which nonhuman CDRs are covalently linked to human FR and/or Fc/pFc' regions to produce a functional antibody.<br>
As another example, WO 92/04381 describes the production and use of humanized murine RSV antibodies in which at least part of the murine FR regions have been replaced with FR regions of a human origin. Antibodies of this kind, including fragments of intact antibodies with antigen-binding capability, are often referred to as 'chimeric" antibodies-<br>
According to the invention, the term 'antibody" also includes Ffab' ) -, Fab,. Fv, and Fd fraaments of antiboazes, chimeric anmbodies, in wnich trie Fc and/or FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with homologous human or nonhuman sequences, chimeric F(ab')2-fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with homologous human or nonhuman sequencesr chimeric Fab-fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with  homologous  human  or  nonhuman  sequences,  and<br><br><br>
The invention also comprises proteins and peptides which bind specifically to tumor-associated antigens. Binding substances of this kind may be provided, for example by degenerate peptide libraries which may be prepared simply in solution in an immobilized form or as phage-display libraries. It is likewise possible to prepare combinatorial libraries of peptides with one or more amino acids. Libraries of peptoids and nonpeptidic synthetic residues may also be prepared.<br>
Antibodies may also be coupled to specific	diagnostic<br>
substances for displaying cells and tissues	expressing<br>
tumor-associated antigens. They may also be	coupled to<br>
therapeutically useful substances.<br>
Diagnostic substances include any label that functions to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer); (iii) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility,  by charge,  hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (iv) provide a capture moiety,  e.g.,  affinity,  antibody/antigen,  or ionic ccmplexation.  Suitable as label are structures, such  as  fiuorescenr   labels,   luminescent   labels, chromophore  labels,  radioisotopic  labels,  isotopic labels,  preferably stable  isotopic  labels,  isobaric labels, enzyme labels, particle labels, in particular metal  particle  labels,  magnetic  particle  labels, polymer particle labels, small organic molecules such as biotin,  ligands of receptors or binding molecules such  as  cell  adhesion  proteins  or  lectins,  label-sequences comprising nucleic acids and/or amino acid residues which  can be  detected by use  of binding<br><br><br>
According to the invention, the term 'therapeutically useful substance" means any molecule which may exert a therapeutic  effect.  According  to  the  invention,  a therapeutically   useful   substance   is   preferably selectively guided to a cell which expresses one or more tumor-associated antigens and includes anticancer agents,  radioactive iodine-labeled compounds,  toxins, cytostatic or cytolytic drugs, etc. Anticancer agents comprise, for example, aminoglutethimide, azathioprine, bleomycin sulfate, busulfan, carmustine, chlorambucil, cisplatin,        cyclophosphamide,        cyclosporine, cytarabidine,  dacarbazine,  dactinomycin,  daunorubin, doxorubicin,     taxol,     etoposide,     fluorouracil, interferon-a, lomustine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, mitotane,  procarbazine HCl,  thioguanine,  vinblastine sulfate  and  vincristine  sulfate,  Other  anticancer agents  are described,  for example,  in  Goodman  and Gilman,  'The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", 8th  Edition,  19 90,  McGraw-Hill,  Inc.,  in  particular Chapter 52  iAnrineoplastic Agents  (Paul Calabresi anc Bruce A.  Chabner) ,  Toxins may be proteins  such as pokeweed antiviral protein,  cholera toxin,  pertussis toxin,  ricin,  gelonin,  abrin, diphtheria exotoxin or Pseudomonas   exotoxin. Toxin residues may also be high energy-err.emitting radionuclides such as cobalt-60.<br>
The term 'major histocompatibility complex" or 'MHC" relates to a complex of genes present in all vertebrates. MHC proteins or molecules are involved in<br><br>
signaling between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells in normal immune reactions by binding peptides<br><br>
(TCR) . MHC molecules bind peptides within an intra cellular process d.ng compartment and present these peptides on the surface of antigen presenting cells for recognition by T cells. The human MHC region also termed HLA is located on chromosome 6 and includes the class I and class II region. In one preferred embodiment of all aspects of the invention an MHC molecule is an HLA molecule,<br>
"Reduce" or 'inhibit" as used herein means the ability to cause an overall decrease, preferably of 20% or greater, more preferably of 50% or greater, and most preferably of 75% or greater, in the level, e.g, in the level of protein or mRNA as compared to a reference sample (e * g. , a sample not treated with siRNA) . This reduction or inhibition of RNA or protein expression can occur through targeted mRNA cleavage or degradation. Assays for protein expression or nucleic acid expression are known in the art and include, for example, ELISA, western blot analysis for protein expression, and northern blotting or RNase protection assays for RNA.<br>
The term "patient" means according , to the invention a<br><br>
particular a mammal such as a cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat/ dog, cat or a rodent such as a mouse and rat. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the patient is a human being.<br>
"Abnormal expression" means according to the ■■ invention compared to the state in a healthy individual.<br><br>
According to the invention the term "increased' or 'increased amount" preferably refers to an increase by<br><br>
or at least 100%. The amount of a substance is also increased in a test sample such as a biologica] sample compared to a reference sample if it is detectable in the test sample but absent or not detectable in the reference sample,<br>
According to the invention, the term "disease" refers to any pathological state in which tumor-associated antigens are expressed or abnormally expressed, "Abnormal expression" means according to the invention that expression is altered, preferably increased, compared to the state in a healthy individual. An increase in expression refers to an increase by at least 10%, in particular at least 20%, at least 50% or at least 100%, In one embodiment, the tumor-associated antigen is expressed only in tissue of a diseased individual, while expression in a healthy individual is repressed- One example of such a disease is cancer, wherein the term 'cancer" according to the invention comprises leukemias, seminomas, melanomas, teratomas, lymphomas, neuroblastomas, gliomas, rectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, adrenal cancer, thyroid cancer, blood cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the brain, cervical cancer, intestinal cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer; stomach cancer, intestine cancer,. head and neck cancer, gastroin"cestinal cancer, iympe node cancer, esophagus cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, ear, nose and throat (ENT) cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cancer of the uterus, ovarian cancer and lung cancer and the matastases thereof. Examples thereof are lung carcinomas, mamma carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, colon carcincsmas, renal cell carcinomas, cervical carcinomas, or metastases of the cancer types or tumors described above . The term cancer according to the invention also<br><br>
comprises cancer metastases.<br>
By "tumor" is meant an abnormal Group of cells or tissue that grows by a rapid uneontrolied cellular proliferation and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated the new growth cease. Tumors show partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue, and usually form a distinct mass of tissue, which may be either benign or malignant•<br>
By "metastasis" is meant the spread of cancer cells from its original site to another part of the body- The formation of metastasis is a very complex process and depends on detachment of malignant cells from the primary tumor, invasion of the extracellular matrix, penetration of the endothelial basement membranes to enter the body cavity and vessels, and then, after being transported by the blood, infiltration of target organs, Finally, the growth of a new tumor at the target site depends on angiogenesis. Tumor metastasis often occurs even after the removal of the primary tumor because tumor cells or components may remain and develop metastatic potential. In one embodiment, the term ''metastasis" according to the invention relates to "distant metastasis" which relates to a metastasis which is remote from the primary tumor and the regional lymph node system.<br>
According to the invention, a biological sample may be a tissue sample, including bodily fluids, and/or a cellular sample and may be obtained in the conventional<br><br>
biopsy, and by taking blood, bronchial aspirate, sputum, urine, feces or other body fluids. According to<br><br>
the invention, the term 'biological sample" also includes fractions of biological samples,<br>
According to the invention, the term "immunoreact i ve cel1" means a cell which can mature into an immune cell (such as B cell, T helper cell, or cytolytic T cell) with suitable stimulation. Immunoreactive cells comprise 0034 hematopoietic stem cells, immature and mature T cells and immature and mature B cells. If production of cytolytic or T helper cells recognizing a tumor-associated antigen is desired, the immunoreactive cell is contacted with a cell expressing a tumor-associated antigen under conditions which favor production, differentiation and/or selection of cytolytic T cells and of T helper cells. The differentiation of T cell precursors into a cytolytic T cell, when exposed to an antigen, is similar to clonal selection of the immune system.<br>
The terms 'T cell" and "T lymphocyte" are used interchangeably herein and include T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells which comprise cytolytic T cells.<br>
Some therapeutic methods are based on a reaction of the immune system of a patient, which results in a lysis of antigen-presenting cells such as cancer cells which present one or more tumor-associated antigens. In this connection, for example autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for a complex of a tumor-associated antigen and an MHC molecule are adminisrerec to a patient having a cellular abnormality. The production of such cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro is known. An example of a method of differentiating T cells can be found in WO^A-9633265. Generally, a sample containing cells such as blood cells is taken from the patient and the cells are contacted with a cell which presents the complex and which can cause propagamon oi cytotoxic T lymphocytes (e.g. dendritic cells). The target cell may be a transfected cell such as a COS<br><br>
cell,  These  transfeeted  cells  present  the  desired complex  on  their  surface  and,  when  contacted  with<br><br>
Iymphocytes are then administered to the patient-<br>
In another method of selecting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, fluorogenic tetramers of MHC class I molecule/peptide complexes are used for obtaining specific clones of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Altman et al,, Science 274:94-96, 1996; Dunbar et al,, Curr.   Biol.   8:413-416, 1998).<br>
The present invention also includes therapeutic methods referred  to  as  adoptive  transfer  (Greenberg,  J. Immunol.     136(5) :1917,  1986;  Riddel  et  al. , Science 257:238, 1992; Lynch et al,, EuT.    J.    Immunol.    21:1403-1410,  1991;  Kast  et  al. , Cell     59:603-614,  198 9), wherein  cells presenting the  desired complex  (e.g. dendritic  cells)  are  combined  with  cytotoxic  T lymphocytes of the patient to be treated, resulting in a propagation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The propagated   cytotoxic   T   lymphocytes   are   then administered to a patient having a cellular anomaly characterized by particular abnormal cells presenting the specific complex. The cytotoxic T lymphocytes then lyse the abnormal cells, thereby achieving a desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Furthermore, ceils presenting trie desirec ccmple:-: le. z. . dendritic cells) may be combined with cytotoxic T lymphocytes of healthy individuals or another species (e.g. mouse) which may result in propagation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes with high affinity. The high affinity T cell receptor of these propagated specific T lymphocytes may be cloned and optionally humanizea to a different extent, and tne T ceil receptors thus obtained then transduced via gene transfer, for example using retroviral vectors, into T<br><br>
cells  of  patients.  Adoptive  transfer  may  then  be<br>
carried  out   using   these   genetically   altered   T<br>
70, 2001; Kessels et al,, Nat Immunol. 2:957-61, 2001).<br>
Adoptive transfer is not the only form of therapy which can be applied according to the invention. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes may also be generated In vivo in a manner known per se, One method uses nonproliferative cells expressing the complex. The cells used here will be those which usually express the complex, such as irradiated tumor cells or cells transfected with one or both genes necessary for presentation of the complex (i.e. the antigenic peptide and the presenting MHC molecule). Another preferred form is the introduction of the tumor-associated antigen in the form of recombinant RNA which may be introduced into cells by liposomal transfer or by electroporation, for example, The resulting cells present the complex of interest and are recognized by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes which then propagate.<br>
A similar effect can be achieved by combining the. tumor-associated antigen or a fragment thereof with an adjuvant in order to make incorporation into antigen-presenting cells in vivo possible. The tumor-associated antigen or a fragment thereof may be represented as protein, as DNA (e.g. within a vector) or as RNA. The<br><br>
thereof may be presented without the need for further processing. The latter is the case in particular, if -hese can bind to MHC molecules. Preference is given to administration forms in which the complete antigen is processed in vivo by a dendriric cell, since this may also produce T helper cell responses which are needed for an effective immune response (Ossendorp et al, , Immunol Lett. 74:75-9 2000; Ossendorp et al., J. Exp. Med.    187:693-702, 1998). In general, it is possible to<br><br>
administer an effective amount of the tumor-associated ' antigen  to  a  patient  by  intradermal  injection,  for<br><br>
intranodally into a lymph node (Maloy et al., Proc Natl Acad  Sci   USA   98:3299-303, 2001).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment described according to the invention may also be used for immunization or vaccination to therapeutically treat or prevent a disease described herein. According to the invention, the terms "immunization" or "vaccination" preferably relate to an increase in or activation of an immune response to an antigen. It is possible to us.e animal models for testing an immunizing effect on cancer by using a tumor-associated antigen or a nucleic acid coding therefor. For example, human cancer cells may be introduced into a mouse to generate a tumor, and one or more nucleic acids coding for tumor-associated antigens may be administered. The effect on the cancer cells (for example reduction in tumor size) may be measured as a measure for the effectiveness of an immunization by the nucleic acid.<br>
As part of the composition for an immunization or a vaccination, preferably one or more tumor-associated antigens or stimulating fragments thereof are administered together with one or more adjuvants for<br>
inducing an immune response or for increasina an immune response- An adjuvant is a substance which is incorporated into the antigen or administered together with the latter and which enhances the immune response. Adjuvants may enhance the immune response by providing an antigen reservoir (extracellularly or in macrophages), activating macrophages and/or stimulating particular lymphocytes. Adjuvants are known and comprise in a nonlimiting way monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, SmithKline Beecham), saponins such as QS21 (SmithKline  Beecham),   DQS21   (SmithKline  Beecham;<br><br>
wo 96/33739) ,  QS7, QS17,  QS18 and QS-Ll  (So et al. , Hoi.   Cells  7: 178-186,   1997),   incomplete  Freund s<br>
montanide, alum, CpG oligonucleotides (cf. Kreig et 3.1 . r Nature 374:546-9, 1995) and various water-in-oil emulsions prepared from biologically degradable oils such as sgualene and/or tocopherol. Preferably, the peptides are administered in a mixture with DQS21/MPL. The ratio of DQS21 to MPL is typically about 1:10 to 10:1, preferably about 1:5 to 5:1 and in particular about 1:1. For administration to humans, a vaccine formulation typically contains DQS21 and MPL in a range from about 1 µg to about 100 µg.<br>
Other substances which stimulate an immune response of the patient may also be administered. It is possible,-for example, to use cytokines in a vaccination, owing to their regulatory properties on lymphocytes. Such cytokines comprise, for example, interleukin-12 (IL-12) which was shown to increase the protective actions of vaccines (cf. Science 268:1432-1434, 1995), GM-CSF and IL-18.<br>
There are a number of compounds which enhance an immune response and which therefore may be used in a vaccination. Said compounds comprise costimulating molecules provided in the form of proteins or nucleic acids such as B7-1 and B7-2 (CD80 and CD86, resoectively).<br>
The invention also provides for administration of nucleic acids proteins or peptides. Proteins and peptides may be administered in a manner known per se. In one embodiment, nucleic acids are administered by ex vivo methods, i.e, by remox'-ing cells from a patient, genetic modification of said cells in order to incorporate  a  tumor-associated antigen and reintroduction of the altered cells into the patient. This generally comprises introducing a functional copy<br><br>
of a gene into the cells of a patient in vitro and reintroducing the genetically altered cells  into the<br>
functional control of regulatory elements which allow the gene to be expressed in the genetically altered cells. Transfection and transduction methods are known to the skilled worker. The invention also provides for administering nucleic acids in vivo by using vectors such as viruses and target--controlled liposomes. If according to the invention reference is made to the administration or incorporation into pharmaceutical compositions of nucleic acids this includes embodiments wherein the nucleic acid is present in such vectors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a virus or viral vector for administering a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen is selected from the group consisting of adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses^ pox viruses, including vaccinia virus and attenuated pox viruses^ Semliki Forest virus, retroviruses, Sindbis virus and Ty virus-like particles. Particular preference is given to adenoviruses and retroviruses. The retroviruses are typically replication-deficient (i.e. they are incapable of generating infectious particles).<br>
Methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells in vitro   or in   vivo   comprise transfection of nucleic acid<br>
cal cium phosphate precioitates, transfection of nucleic acids associared witn DEA£, transfection or infection with the above viruses carrying the nucleic acids of interest, liposome-mediated transfection, and the like. In particular embodiments, preference is given to directing the nucleic acid to particular cells, In such embodiments^ a carrier used for adrranistering a nucleic acid to a cell (e/g. a retrovirus or a liposome) may have a bound target control molecule. For example, a molecule such as an antibody specific for a surface membrane protein on the target cell or a ligand for a<br><br>
receptor on the target cell may be incorporated into or attached  to  the  nucleic  acid  carrier.  Preferred<br><br>
tumor-associated ant iutigen.If adiministration of a nucleic acid via liposomes is desired, proteins bindinq to a surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be incorporated into the liposome formulation in order to make target control and/or uptake possible, Such proteins comprise capsid proteins or fragments thereof which are specific for a particular cell type antibodies to proteins which are internalized proteins addressing an intracellular site, and the like.<br>
The therapeutic compositions of the invention may be administered in pharmaceutical!y compatible preparations. Such preparations may usually contain pharmaceutically compatible concentrations of salts, buffer substances, preservatives, carriers, supplementing immunity-enhancing substances such as adjuvants, e.g. CpG oligonucleotides, cytokines, chemokines, saponin, GM-CSF and/or RNA and, where appropriate, other therapeutically active compounds,<br>
The therapeutically active compounds of the invention may  be  administered  via  any  conventional  route, including by injection or infusion. The administration may be carried out, for example, orally, intravenously,<br><br>
therapeutically administered by way of a lung aerosol, Antisense nucleic acids are preferably administered by slow intravenous administration .<br>
The compositions of the invention are administered in effective amounts. An 'effective amount' refers to the amount which achieves a desired reacnion or a aesrred effect alone or together with further doses. In the case of treatment of a particular disease or of a<br><br>
particular condition characterized by expression of one or more tumor-associated antigens, the desired reaction<br>
disease. This comprises slowing down the procress of the disease and, in particular, interrupting or reversing the progress of the disease. The desired reaction in a treatment of a disease or of a condition may also be delay of the onset or a prevention of the onset of said disease or said condition. According to the invention, a diagnosis or treatment of cancer may also include the diagnosis or treatment of cancer metastases which have already formed or will form. According to the invention, the term "treatment" comprises therapeutic and prophylactic treatment, i.e. prevention.<br>
An effective amount of a composition of the invention will depend on the condition to be treated, the severeness of the disease, the individual parameters of the patient, including age, physiological condition, size and weight, the duration of treatment, the type of an accompanying therapy (if present), the specific route of administration and similar factors.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably sterile and contain an effective amount of the therapeutically active substance to generate the desired reaction or the desired effect.<br>
The doses administered of the compositions of the invention may depend on various parameters such as the type of administration, the condition of the patient, the desired period of administration, etc, In the case that a reaction in a patient is insuf f icienr with an initial dose, higher' doses (or effectively higher doses achieved by a different, more localized route of administration) may be used.<br>
Generally,  doses of the tumor-associated antigen of<br><br>
from 1 ng to 1 mg, preferably from 10 ng to 100 µg are formulated  and  administered  for  a  treatment  or  for<br><br>
administration of nucieic acids {DNA and RNA) coding for tumor-associated antigens is desired, doses of from 1 ng to 0.1 mg are formulated and administered.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are generally administered in pharmaceutically compatible amounts and in pharmaceutically compatible compositions, The term "pharmaceutically  compatible" refers to a nontoxic material which does not interact with the action of the active component of the pharmaceutical composition. Preparations of this kind may usually contain salts, buffer substances, preservatives, carriers and, where appropriate, other therapeutically active compounds. When used in medicine, the salts should be pharmaceutically compatible. However, salts which are not pharmaceutically compatible may used for preparing pharmaceutically compatible salts and are included in the invention. Pharmacologically and pharmaceutically compatible salts of this kind comprise in a nonlimiting way those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, citric, formic, ma Ionic, succinic acids, and the like. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may also be prepared as alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium - sains, potassium salts or calcium salus.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a pharmaceutically compatible carrier. According to the invention, the term 'pharmaceutically compatible carrier' refers to one or more comparible solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for administrarion to humans. The term "carrier" refers to an organic or inorganic component, of a natural or synthetic nature,<br><br>
in which the active component is combined in order to facilitate   application.   The   components   of   the<br>
such that no interaction occurs which substantial J, y impairs the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain suitable buffer substances such as acetic acid in a salt, citric acid in a salt, boric acid in a salt and phosphoric acid in a salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may, where appropriate, also contain suitable preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, paraben and thimerosal,<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are usually provided in a uniform dosage form and may be prepared in a manner known per se. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form of capsules, tablets, lozenges, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs or in the form of an emulsion, for example-<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral administration usually comprise a sterile aqueous or nonaqueous preparation of the active compound, which is preferably isotonic to the blood of the recipient. Examples of compatible carriers and solvents are Ringer solution and isotonic sodium chloride so] uti on . In addition,, usually sterxle, rixed oils are used as solution or suspension medium.<br>

Material and methods<br>
The techniques and methods mentioned herein are carried out in a manner known per se and are described, for example, in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y, All methods including the use of kits and reagents are carried out according to the manufacturers' information.<br>
RNA extraction, preparation of poly-d{T) primed cDNA and conventional RT-PCR analysis<br>
Total RNA was extracted from native tissue material by using guanidium isothiocyanate' as chaotropic agent (Chomczynski &amp; Sacchi, Anal. Biochem. 162:156-9, 1987). After extraction with acidic phenol and precipitation with isopropanol, said RNA was dissolved in DEPC-treated water.<br>
First strand cDNA synthesis from 4 µg of total RNA was carried out in a 20 µl reaction mixture by means of Superscript II (Invitrogen) , according to the manufacturer's information. The primer used was a dT(18) oligonucleotide. Integrity and quality of the cDNA were checked by amplification of p53 in a 30 cycle PCR ( (SEQ ID NO:33,34)), hybridization temperature 67"C).<br>
An archive of f j_rst strand cDNA was prepared from a number of normal tissues and tumor entities. For expression studies, 0,5 µl of these cDNAs was amplified in a 30 µl reaction mixture, using GOI-specific primers (see below) and 1 U of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) . Each reaction mixture contained 150µM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of each primer and 3 µl of 10 x reaction buffer. The primers were selected so as to be located in two different exons, and elimination of the interference by contaminating genomic DNA as the reason for false-<br><br>
positive results was conrirmea oy testing nonreverse-transcribed DNA as template. After 15 minutes at 95°C<br>
PCR wern carried out (0.5 min at 94°C, 0.5 min at the particular hybridization temperature, 0.5 min at 1?/Q. and final elongation at 72°C for 6 min).<br>
20 fil of this reaction were fractionated and analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.<br>
Preparatiion of randoan hexamer-prined cDNA. and quantitative real-time PCR<br>
The expression of several genes was quantified by real¬time PCR. The PCR products were detected using SYBR Green as intercalating reporter dye. The reporter fluorescence of SYBR Green is suppressed in solution and the dye is active only after binding to double-stranded DNA fragments. The increase in the SYBR Green fluorescence as a result of the specific amplification using GOl^specific primers after each PCR cycle is utilized for quantification. Expression of the target gene is quantified absolutely or relative to the expression of a control gene with constant expression in the tissues to be investigated. Expression was measured after standardization of the samples against 18s RNA as so-called housekeeping gene using the AA-Ct method (PE Biosystems, USA). The reactions were carried out in duplicates and determined in triplicates. The QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized with random primers (Invitrogen; using the protocol described above. Each 5 pi portions of the diluted cDNA were employed in a total volume of 30 ]il for the PCR: sense primer 300 nM, antisense primer 300 nM; initial denaturation 95°C for 15 min; 95°C for 30 sec; annealing for 30 sec; 72°C for 30 sec; 40 cycles. The sequences of the primers used are indicated in the respective examples.<br><br>
Cloning and sequence analysis<br>
Cloning of full-lengths and gene fragments took place<br><br>
corresponding antigenes were arriplified using the proofreading polymerase pfu (Stratagene). After corapletion of the PCR, adenosine was ligated by means of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase to the ends of the amplicon in order to clone the fragments in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions into the TOPO-TA vector. The sequencing was carried out by a commercial service, The sequences were analysed using conventional prediction programs and algorithms-<br>
Cell proliferation analysis<br>
24 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes 1x104 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with varying concentrations of FCS for 4 8 h- Proliferation was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of BrdU into newly synthesized DNA strands using the DELFIA cell proliferation Kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Wallac Victor2 multi-label counter (Perkin Elmer).<br>
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis<br>
Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with FCS in varying concentrations, harvested after 4 8 h and stained with propidiumiodide prior to flowcytometrie<br>
S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle were quantified using CellQuest-Software (Becton Dickinson),<br>
Cell migration<br>
Cell  migration  assays  were  conducted  in  transwe11<br>
with cells cultured in serum-free medium for 12h prior to the experiments. For siRNA experiments cells were<br><br>
transferred  to  serum-free  conditions  24  h  after transfection with siRNA duplexes as    described above.<br>
added to the upper chamber. The bottom chambers contained 8 00 p]. culture rriedium supplemented with either PCS, PDGF-3B (Sigma-Aldrich) or SDF-la/CXCL12 (R&amp;D Systems) as chemoattractants. After 2 4 hours cells that had migrated to the bottom side of the membrane were fixed in ice-cold methanol; membranes were excised, placed on microscope slides and mounted with Hoechst (Dako) for fluorescence microscopy. Cells in five random visual fields (lOOx magnification) were counted for each membrane. All experiments were done in triplicates. Effects on chemokinesis of cells was analyzed using the same experimental setup with (i) no chemoattractant added to the upper and lower chamber and (ii) with chemoattractant added to both the upper and lower chamber.<br>
In vitro invasion assay<br>
In vivo invasion assays were conducted in transwe11 chambers with 8.0 \im pore membranes (BD Biosciences) with cells cultured in serum-free medium for 12h prior to the experiments. Upper chambers were prepared with lOOial of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted to 1 mg/ml in serum free medium. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 5h for gelling. For siRNA experiments cells were transferred to serum-free conditions 24 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes as described above. 1x105 cells in 400 µl serum-free culture medium were added to the upper chamber. The bottom chambers contained 800 µl culture medium supplemented with FCS as chemoattractant.

Example 1: Identl£icat:ion of ISC-468 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-468 (SEQ ID N0:1) encodes a protein of 212 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) and with a molecular weight of 23,6 kDa.<br>
It has been previously described as placenta-specific protein expressed during pregnancy (Fant et al., Mol Reprod Dev.   63:430-6, 2002)<br>
The protein is predicted to have a cleavable signal peptide from aa 1-23, followed by a short putative transmembrane domain (aa 25-47) as analysed by bioinformatics tools (TMpred, SOUSI). The remaining protein is predicted to be extracellular and can therefore be used according to the invention as target structure for monoclonal antibodies.<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO: 3, 4) for ISC-468 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues. As expected, placenta was confirmed as the only healthy tissue expressing   this   gene   (fig.l).   No   significant<br><br>
normal organ tissue. Most surprisingly, when cancer specimen were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in a number of different tumor types, including colon, pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, lung, breast, ovrian, headS&amp;neck, kidney, prostate and liver carcinomas (fig.1 and 2 as<br><br>

The selective and high expression of ISC-468 transcripts in tumors was not previously known and can be utilized' according to the invention for molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR for detecting disseminating tumor cells in the serum and bone marrow and for detecting metastases in other tissues. This molecule can be further used as specific target for therapeutic approaches.<br>
The following peptides, inter alia, were selected for producing ISC-4 68 specific antibodies according to the invention: SEQ ID NO:58, 59, 60, 68, 69, 2. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of I3C-46e-eGFP transfected cells (fig,21A).<br><br>
expressing breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT*549 was analyzed by' immunofluorescence analyses. Staining<br><br>
of either MeOH-fixed (fig,21B) or" non-fixed (fig,21C) cells revealed that ISC-4 68 is localized at the plasma<br><br>
staining was confirmed by RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-468 expression, resulting in the loss of plasma mebrane staining.<br>
Furthermore, ISC-468 specific antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis of ISC-468 expression in clinical samples of normal breast and breast carcinomas. Expression of ISC-468 was not detectable in normal breast specimens (fig.22A,B). In contrast^ breast carcinoma specimens showed strong and homogeneous expression of 130-468 (fig.22C,D). Signals were accentuated at the plasmamembrane of the expressing cancer cells, confirming that ISC-468 is a membrane protein selectively expressed in cancfer cells.<br>
The extracellular domains of ISC-468 can be used according to the invention as target structure for immunodiagnosis and therapy by means of monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ISC-468 can be employed according to the invention as vaccine (RNA, DNA, protein, peptides) for inducing tumor-specific immune responses (T and B cell-mediated immune responses) ,<br>
RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-4 58 expression was achieved by transfeetion of cells with siRNA duplexes<br>
specifically targeting TSC-468 mRNA fSEQ In Nos: 70-73; . Transfecrion of endogenously expressing breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-54 9 resulted in stable and specific reduction of ISC-468 mRNA expression (fig.23),<br>
To gain insight into the physiological role of ISC-46B expression several RNAi-based in vitro cell assays were performed, Transfection of breast carcionoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-54 9 with siRNA duplexes resulted in a distinct reduction of cell proliferation compared to<br><br>
the respective controls, as analyzed in a BrdU-based proliferation  assay  (fig-24),  FACS-based  cell  cycle<br><br>
proliferation 'resulted from a Gl/S arrest (tig.25A,B). Additionally, it could be shown that RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-468 profoundly affects the AKT signaling pathway in endogenously expressing cancer cells by inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (fig,26). Furthermore, proliferation of MCF-7 cells was attenuated when cells were incubated with ISC-468 specific antibodies generated against ISC-468 specific peptides (SEQ ID NO:68,69) compared to an irrelevant control antibody (fig.27). These results indicate that ISC-46B is a critical factor for the proliferation of cancer cells presumably by mediating growth factor-induced activation of the AKT signaling pathway and others, ISC-468 itself might represent a receptor, co-receptor or membrane-bound chaperone for growth-factors^ chemokines or other substances,<br>
Furthermore, the impact of ISC-468 expression on the migratory ability of cancer cells was analyzed- RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-4 68 expression in breastcarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-549 resulted in distinct impairment of chemotaxis, chemokinesis and invasion of the cells, as assessed in transwell migration assays (fig 28A,B,C) . Chemotaxis, chemokinesis and invasion are critical factors for the metastasis of cancer cells to other organs. Therefore, expression of ISC-4 68 in cancer cells mignu be a positive factor for cancer cell metastasis.<br>
In breast carcinomas, it could be shown that expression of ISC-46B is correlated with the estrogen-receptor state of the tumor. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of ISC-468 expression in 60 breast carcinoma samples revealed that estrogen-recepi:or positive breast carcinomas showed significantly higher levels of ISC-468 expression than receptor-negative tumors (fig.29).<br><br>
Accordingly, expression of ISC-4 68 could be induced in<br>
estrogen-receptor positive breast carcinoma cell line<br>
Example 2: Identification of ISC-507 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-507 (SEQ ID N0:5) encodes a 754 aa protein (SEQ ID NO: 6) with a molecular weight of 85,6 kDa. ISC-507 is member of a family of zinc-binding proteins with disintegrin and metalloprotease activities that can function as adhesion proteins and/or endopeptidases. Members of this family have been described as involved in a number , of biologic processes, including fertilization, neurogenesis, muscle development, and immune response (Seals et al., Genes  Dev,   17(l):7-30, 2003)<br>
ISC-507 has one transmembrane domain (aa 671^687), a large N-terminal extracellular and a shorter C-terminal cytoplasmatic region.<br>
ISC-507 expression has been reported to be specifically restricted to mammalian epididymis, the small gland adjacent to the testicle, which is critically involved in maturation of sperm. According to literature, ISC-507 is transferred from the epididymis to the sperm surface and redistributed in the sperm head during acrosome reaction (Adachi et al., Mol Reprod Dev. G 4 : 4 i 4 -11, 2 00 3).<br>
RT-PCR investigations with ISC-507  specific primers<br>
(SEQ ID NO:7, 8) confirmed selective expression in the testis and absence of ISC-507 from any other normal tissue (tab.2, fig,3)^ except weak expression in prostate and lymph node derived tissues (tab.2, fig*4).<br>
However and most surprisingly, we observed expression of ISC-507 in a significant number of prostate cancers<br><br><br>
The absence from toxicity relevant normal tissues and the frequent and significant expression of ISC-507 in prostate cancers make this protein according to the invention a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic marker, This includes according to the invention the detection of disseminated tumor cells  in  serum,  bone marrow,<br>
by means of RT-PCR. In addition, the extracellular domains of ISC-507 can be used according to the invention as target structure for immunodiagnosis and rherapy by means of monoclonal antibodies. In addition,<br>
ISC-507 can be employed according to the invention as vaccine  (RNA,  DNA,  protein,  peptides)  for  inducing<br>
immune responses) .<br><br>
Antibodies for detecting ISC~507 could be produced with following peptides and proteins: SEQIDN0:51, 52,  53,<br>
According to the invention an antibody which binds to ISC-507 might be useful for therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
purposes.<br>

The RT-PCR analysis reveals expression of ISC-466 transcripts in normal placenta,  and weak expression  in  thymus  and  ovary<br><br>
when cancer cell lines were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in a number of tumor types, including breast cancer (fig.50), lung cancer (fig.5C) , ovarian carcinoma (fig.5D) and head and neck- and kidney carcinomas (fig.SB).<br><br><br>
In contrast to the observation, that ISC-4 66 is involved by colorectal carcinomas (Salahshor et al. , BMC Cancer, 5:66, 2005), our investigations reveal ISC-466 according to the invention as diagnostic and therapeutic marker for head &amp; neck, breast, ovarian, prostate cancer and melanoma.<br>
Example 4: Identification of ISC-518 as therapeutic and<br>
diagnostoc cancer target.<br>
ISC-518  (SEQ ID NO:13)  encodes  a 237  aa  translation<br>
product (SEQ ID NO:14). However, no data with regard to<br>
tissue distribution and no connection to cancer is<br>

Expression levels are clearly higher ::han expression in normal ovary.<br><br><br><br>
Example 6: Identification of ISC-489 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-489 (SEQ ID N0:21) encodes a 363 aa translation product (SEQ ID NO:22). The protein is a newly described member of the family of G-protein coupled receptors. However, no data with regard to tissue distribution and no connection to cancer was publically available.<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO:23,24) for ISC-489 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues.

Identification   of   t-vunor-associated   antigens   for diagnosis and therapy<br>
Despite interdiscipliDary approaches and exhaustive use of classical therapeutic procedures, cancers are still among the leading causes of death. More recent therapeutic concepts aim at incorporating the patient's immune system into the overall therapeutic concept by using recombinant tumor vaccines and other specific measures such as antibody therapy. A prerequisite for the success of such a strategy is the recognition of tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens or epitopes by the patient's immune system whose effector functions are to be interventionally enhanced. Tumor cells biologically differ substantially from their nonmalignant cells of origin. These differences are due to genetic alterations acquired during tumor development and result, inter alia, also in the formation of qualitatively or quantitatively altered molecular structures in the cancer cells. Tumor-associated structures of this kind which are recognized by the specific immune system of the tumor-harboring host are referred to as tumor-associated antigens. The specific recognition of tumor-associated antigens involves cellular and humoral mechanisms which are two functionally interconnected units: CD4+ and CDS+ T lymphocytes recognize rhe processed antigens presented on the molecules of the MHC (major histocompatibiliry complex) classes II and I, respectively, while B lymphocytes produce circulating antibody molecules which bind directly to unprocessed antigens, The potential clinical-therapeutical importance of tumor-associated antigens results from the fact that the recognition of antigens on neoplasric cells by rhe immune system leads to the initiation of cytotoxic effector mechanisms and, in the presence of T helper<br><br>
cells, can cause elimination of the cancer cells (Pardoll, Nat. Med. 4:525-31, 1998). Accordingly, a central aim of tumor  immunology is to molecular!y define these structures. The molecular narure of these antigens has been enigmatic for a long time. Only after development of appropriate cloning techniques has it been possible to screen cDNA expression libraries of tumors systematically for tumor-associated antigens by analyzing the target structures of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (van der Bruggen et al.. Science 254:1643^7, 1991) or by using circulating autoantibodies (Sahin et al,, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 9:709-16, 1997) as probes. To this end, cDNA expression libraries were prepared from fresh tumor tissue and recombinantly expressed as proteins in suitable systems. Immunoeffectors isolated from patients, namely CTL clones with tumor-specific lysis patterns, or circulating autoantibodies were utilized for cloning the respective antigens.<br>
In recent years a multiplicity of antigens have been defined in various neoplasias by these approaches.<br>
However, the probes utilized for antigen identification in the classical methods are immunoeffectors (circulating autoantibodies or CTL clones) from patients usually having already advanced cancer. A number of data indicate that tumors can lead, for example, to tolerization and anergization of T cells ana that, during the course of the disease, especially those specificities which could cause effective immune recognition are lost from the immunoeffector repertoire. Current patient studies have not yet produced any solid evidence of a real action of the previously found and utilized tumor-associated antigens. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that proteins evoking spontaneous immune responses are the wrong target structures.<br><br>
It was the object of the present invention to provide target  structures  tor  a  diagnosis  and  therapy  of<br>
cancers.<br>
This object is achieved by the subject matter of the<br>
claims.<br>
According to the invention genes are identified which are selectively or aberrantly expressed in tumor cells and thus, provide tumor-associated antigens. These genes and/or their genetic products and/or the derivatives and/or fragments thereof are useful as target structures for therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.<br>

In a further preferred embodiment, a tumor-associated antigen identified according to the invention comprises an amino acid sequence selected from tne group consisting ot St^Q ID NOs: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 29, 31, 36, 40, 42, 46, 50-60, 63, 68, and 69 of the sequence listing, a part<br><br>
or derivative thereof.<br>
Tho present invention general1y relates to the use of tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or of parts or derivatives thereof; of nucleic acids coding for the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or of parts or derivatives thereof or of nucleic acids directed against said coding nucleic acids, of antibodies or T cells directed against the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof and/or of host cells expressing the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring of neoplastic diseases. This may also involve the use of a combination of two or more of these antigens, nucleic acids, antibodies, T cells and/or host cells, in one embodiment also in combination with tumor-associated antigens other than those identified according to the invention, nucleic acids coding therefor or nucleic acids directed against said coding nucleic acids, antibodies or T cells directed against said tumor-associated antigens and/or host cells expressing said tumor associated antigens.<br>
In those embodiments of the invention relating to the use of antibodies directed against the tumor-associated<br>
antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives rhereof also T cell receptors directed against the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention or parts or derivatives thereof, optionally in a complex with MHC molecules, may be used.<br>
Especially suitable for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring is a part of rhe tumor-associateo antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds  to  the  non-transmembrane  portion,  in<br><br>
particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof. Therefore, arcordinq to the invention, a part of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds to the non-transmembrane portion, in particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof, or a corresponding part of the nucleic acids coding for the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention is preferred for therapy, prophylaxis, diagnosis and/or monitoring. Similarly the use of antibodies is preferred which are directed against a part of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention which corresponds to the non-transmembrane portion, in particular the extracellular portion of the tumor-associated antigens or is comprised thereof.<br>
Preferred diseases for a therapy, prophylaxis and/or diagnosis are those in which one or more of the tumor-associated antigens identified according to the invention are selectively expressed or abnormally expressed.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to nucleic acids and proteins or peptides, which result from altered splicing (splice variants) of known genes or altered translation using alternative open reading frames. In<br>
this aspect the invention relates to nucleic acids which comprise a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 28 and 49 of the sequence listing. Moreover, in this aspect, the invetion relates to proteins or peptides which comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 50 of the sequence listing.<br>
Altered splicing of a gene results in an altered transcript sequence (splice variant). Translation of a<br><br>
splice variant in the region of its altered sequence results in an altered protein which may be distinctly<br><br>
original protein. Tumor-associated splice variants may produce tumor-associated transcripts and tumor-associated proteins/antigens. These may be utilized as molecular markers both for detecting tumor cells and for therapeutic targeting of tumors . Detection of tumor cells in a sample from a patient may be carried out according to the invention for example, after extraction of nucleic acids by PCR amplification with splice variant-specific oligonucleotides.<br>
According to the invention, all sequence^dependent detection systems are suitable for detection. These are, apart from PCR, for example gene chip/microarray systems, Northern blot, RNAse protection assays (RDA) and others. All detection systems have in common that detection is based on a specific hybridization with at least one splice variant-specific nucleic acid sequence. However, tumor cells may also be detected according to the invention by antibodies which recognize a specific epitope encoded by the splice variant. Said antibodies may be prepared by using for immunization peptides which are specific for said splice variant. Suitable for immunization are particularly the amino acid sequences which are distinctly different from the variant(s) of the genetic Droduct, which is fare oreferablv produced in healthv cells. Detection of the tumor cells with antibodies may be carried out here on a sample isolated from the patient or as imaging with intravenously administered antibodies.<br>
In addition to diagnostic usability, splice variants having new or altered epitopes are attractive targets for immunotherapy as these epitopes may be utilized for targeting antibodies or T lymphocytes as described herein.  In  passive  immunotherapy,  antibodies  or  T<br><br>
lymphocytes which recognize splice variant-specific epitopes are adoptively transferred here.  As in the<br>
case of other ant i a ens, antibodies may be generated also by using standard technologies with utilization of polypeptides which include these epi,topes. Alternatively it is possible to utilize for immunization nucleic acids coding for peptides which contain said epitopes. Various techniques for in vitro or in vivo generation of epitope-specific T lymphocytes are known and have been described in detail (for example Kessler JH, et al. 2001, Sahin et al, , 1997) and are likewise based on utilizing peptides which contain the splice variant-specific epitopes or nucleic acids coding for said peptides. Peptides which contain the splice variant-specific epitopes or nucleic acids coding for said peptides may also be used as pharmaceutically active substances in active immunotherapy (e.g. vaccination, vaccine therapy),<br>

Nucleic acids comprise according to the invention genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA, recombinantly produced and chemically synthesized molecules, According to the invention, a nucleic acid may be present as a single-stranded or double-stranded and linear or covalently circularly closed molecule.<br>
As used herein, the term "RNA" means a molecule comprising at least one ribonucleotide residue. By "ribonucleotide" is meant a nucleotide with a hydroxyl group at the 2'-position of a beta-D-ribo-furanose moiety. The term includes double stranded RNA, single stranded RNA, isolated RNA such as partially purified RNA, essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA, as well as altered RNA that differs from naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion, substitution and/or alteration of one or more nucleotides. Such alterations can include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as to the end(s) of a RNA or internally, for example at one or more nucleotides of the RNA, Nucleotides in RNA molecules can also comprise non-standard nucleotides/ such as non-naturally occurring nucleotides or chemically synthesized nucleosides or deoxynucleotides, These altered RNAs can be referred to as analogs or analogs of naturally-occurring RNA.<br><br>
The nucleic acids described according to the invention<br>
nucleic acid" means according to Lhe invention that the nucleic acid was (i) amplified in vitro, for example by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning, (iii) purified, for example by cleavage and gel-electrophoretic fractionation, or (iv) synthesized, for example by chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is a nucleic acid which is available for manipulation by recombinant DNA techniques-<br>
A nucleic acid is "complementary" to another nucleic acid if the two sequences are capable of hybridizing and forming a stable duplex with one another, with hybridization preferably being carried out under conditions which allow specific hybridization between polynucleotides (stringent conditions), Stringent conditions are described, for example, in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook et al.. Editors, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press. Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989 or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F,M. Ausubel et al,, Editors, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York and refer, for example, to hybridization at 65"C in hybridization buffer (3-5 x SBC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 2-5 mM NaHzPO. (pH 7), 0.5% SDS, 2 rm EDTA). SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0,15 M sodium citrate, pH 7. After hybridization, the membrane to which the DNA has been transferred is washed, for example, in 2 x SSC at room temperature and then in 0.1-0.5 x SSC/0,1 x SDS at temperatures of up to 68°C.<br>
According to the invention, complementary nucleic acids have at least 40%, in particular at ieast 50%, at, ieast 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% and preferably at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99%,<br><br>
identical nucleotides.<br>
The term 'percent a qe identity" is intended to denote a percentage ot nucleotides or of amnio acid residues which are identical between the two sequences to be compared, obtained after the best alignment, this percentage being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being distributed randomly and over their entire length. Sequence comparisons between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are conventionally carried out by comparing these sequences after having aligned them optimally, said comparison being carried out by segment or by "window of comparison" in order to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. The optimal alignment of the sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 4 82, by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P, BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.).<br>
The percentage identity is calculated by determining the number of identical positions between the two sequences being compared, dividing this number by the<br>
number of positions compared and multiplying the result obtained by lOO so as to obtain the percentage identity between these two sequences.<br>
Nucleic acids coding for tumor-associated antigens may.<br><br>
according to the invention, be present alone or in combination with  other  nucleic  acids,  in  particular<br><br>
nucleic acid is functionally linked to expression control sequences or regulatory sequences which may be homologous or heterologous with respect to said nucleic acid. A coding sequence and a regulatory sequence are 'functionally" linked to one another, if they are covalently linked to one another in such a way that expression or transcription of said coding sequence is under the control or under the influence of said regulatory sequence. If the coding sequence is to be translated into a functional protein, then, with a regulatory sequence functionally linked to said coding sequence, induction of said regulatory sequence results in transcription of said coding sequence, without causing a frame shift in the coding sequence or said coding sequence not being capable of being translated into the desired protein or peptide.<br>
The term "expression control sequence" or ^'regulatory sequence" comprises according to the invention promoters, enhancers and other control elements which regulate   expression  of   a   gene.   In   particular<br>
embodiments of the invention, the expression control sequences can be regulated. The exact structure of regulatory sequences may vary as a function of the species  or  cell  type,   but  generally  comprises<br>
5'untranscribed and 5'untranslated sequences which are involved in initiatiion of rranscription anc translation, respectively, such as TATA' box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like More specifically, 5 untranscribed regulatory sequences comprise a promoter region which includes a promoter seauence for transcriptional control of the functionally linked gene. Regulatory sequences may also comprise enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences.<br><br>
According to the invention a nucleic acid may furthermore  be  present  in  combination  with  another<br><br>
secretion of the protein or peptide encoded by said nucleic acid from a host cell. According to- the invention, a nucleic acid may also be present in combination with another nucleic acid which codes for a peptide causing the encoded protein or peptide to be anchored on the cell membrane of the host cell or compartmentalized into particular, organelles of said cell ■ Similarly, a combination with a nucleic acid is possible which represents a reporter gene or any 'tag",<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule is according to the invention a vector, where appropriate with a promoter, which controls expression of a nucleic acid, for example a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen identified according to the invention. The term ^'vector" is used here in its most general meaning and comprises any intermediary vehicle for a nucleic acid which enables said nucleic acid, for example, to be introduced into prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells and, where appropriate, to be integrated into a genome. Vectors of this kind are preferably replicated and/or expressed in the cells, An intermediary vehicle may be adapted, for example, to the use in electroporation, in bombardment with microprojectiles, in liposomal administration, in the transfer with the aid of agrobacteria or in insertion via DNA or RKA viruses.

application.<br><br>
relates to any cell which can be transformed or transfected with an exogenous nucleic acid. The term 'host cells" comprises according to the invention prokaryotic (e.g. E. coii) or eukaryotic cells (e.g. dendritic cells, B cells, CHO cells, COS cells, K5 62 cells, yeast cells and insect cells) . Particular preference is given to mammalian cells such as cells from humans, mice, hamsters, pigs, goats, primates. The cells may be derived from a multiplicity of tissue types and comprise primary cells and cell lines, Specific examples comprise keratinocytes, peripheral blood leukocytes, stem cells of the bone marrow and embryonic stem cells, In further embodiments, the host cell is an antigen-presenting cell, in particular a. dendritic cell, monocyte or a macrophage. A nucleic acid may be present in the host cell in the form of a single copy or of two or more copies and, in one embodiment, is expressed in the host cell.<br>
According to the invention, the term "expression' is used in its most general meaning and comprises the production of RNA or of RNA and protein. It also comprises partial expression of nucleic acids. Furthermore, expression may be carried out transiently or stably- Preferred expression systems in mammalian eel Is comprise pcDNA3.1 and pRc/CMV (Invit rogen, Carlsbad, CA; , which contain a selectable marker such as a gene imparting resistance to G418 (and thus enabling stably transfeeted cell lines to be selected) and the enhancer-promoter sequences of cytomegalovirus (CMV).<br>
In those cases of the invention in which a MHC molecule presents a tumor-associated antigen or a part thereof^ an expression vector may also comprise a nucleic acid sequence coding for said MHC molecule. The nucleic acid<br><br>
sequence coding for the MHC molecule may be present on the same expression vector as the nucleic acid coding<br><br>
or both nucleic aci ds may be present on ditterent expression vectors. In the latter case, the two expression vectors may be cotransfected into a cell - If a host cell expresses neither the tumor-associated antigen or the part thereof nor the MHC molecule both nucleic acids coding therefor may be transfected into the cell either on the same expression vector or on different expression vectors. If the cell already expresses the MHC molecule, only the nucleic acid sequence coding for the tumor-associated antigen or the part thereof can be transfected into the cell.<br>
The invention also comprises kits for amplification of a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen-Such kits comprise, for example, a pair of amplification primers which hybridize to the nucleic acid coding for the tumor-associated antigen. The primers preferably comprise a sequence of 6-50, in particular 10-30, 15-30 and 20-30 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleic acid and are nonoverlapping, in order to avoid the formation of primer dimers. One of the primers will hybridize to one strand of the nucleic acid coding for the tumor-associated antigen, and the other primer will hybridise to the complementary strand in an arrangement which allows<br><br>
associated anrigen.<br>
"'Antisense molecules" or "'antisense nucleic acids" may be used for regulating, in particular reducing, expression of a nucleic acid. The term 'antisense mclecule" or 'antisense nucleic acid" refers according to the invention to an oligonucleotide which is an oligoribonucleotide, oligoaeoxyribonucleoride, moaifiea oligoribonucleotide or modified oligo-deoxyribonucleotide   and   which   hybridizes   under<br><br>
physiological conditions to DNA comprising a particular gene  or  to  mRNA  of  said  gene,  thereby  inhibiting<br><br>
mRNA. According to the invention, an 'antisense molecule" also comprises a construct which contains a nucleic acid or a part thereof in reverse orientation with respect to its natural promoter. An antisense transcript of a nucleic acid . or of a part thereof may form a duplex with the naturally occurring mRNA specifying the enzyme and thus prevent accumulation of or translation of the mRNA into the active enzyme. Another possibility is the use of ribozymes for inactivating a nucleic acid. Antisense oligonucleotides preferred according to the invention have a sequence of 6-50, in particular 10-30, 15-30 and 20-30, contiguous nucleotides of the target nucleic acid and preferably are fully complementary to the target nucleic acid or to a part thereof.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes with an N-terminal or 5' upstream site such as a translation initiation site, transcription initiation site or promoter site. In further embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes with a 3'untranslated region or mRNA splicing site.<br>
In one embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention consists of ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides or a<br>
combination thereof; with the 5 end of one nucleotide and the 3' end of another nucleotiae being linjked to one another by a phosphodiester bond. These oligonucleotides may be synthesized in the conventional manner or produced recombinantly.<br>
In preferred embodiments, an oligonucleotide of the invention is. a 'modified" oligonucleotide. Here, rhe oligonucleotide may be modified in very aifferent ways, without impairing its ability to bind its target, in order  to  increase,  for  example,  its  stability  or<br><br><br>
The term ^'modified oligonucleotide" also comprises oligonucleotides having a covalently modified base and/or sugar, "Modified oligonucleotides" comprise, for example^ oligonucleotides with sugar residues which are covalently bound to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 3 position and a phosphate group at the 5' position. Modified oligonucleotides may comprise, for example, a 2'-0-alkylated ribose residue or another sugar instead of ribose, such as arabinose.<br>
It is to be understood that all embodiments described above with respect to oligonucleotides may also apply to polynucleotides.<br><br><br><br>
One or both strands of the siRNA can also comprise a 3'-overhang. As used herein, a "3'-overhang" refers to at least one unpaired nucleotide extending from the 3'-end of an RNA strand. Thus in one embodiment; the siRNA comprises at least one 3' -overhang of from 1 to about 6 nucleotides (which includes ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides) in lencth ,, preferably from 1 to about 5 nucleotides m length, more preferably from 1 zo about 4 nucleotides in length, and particularly preferably from about 2 to about 4 nucleotides in length. In the embodiment in which both s'trands of che siRNA molecule comprise a 3'-overhang, the length of the overhangs can be the same or different for each strand. In a most preferred embodiment, the 3'-overhang is present on both strands of the siRNA, and is 2 nucleotides in length. For example, each strand of the<br><br>
siRNA of the invention can comprise 3'-overhangs of dideoxythymidylic  acid  ("TT")   or  diuridylic  acid<br>
In order to enhance the stability of the siRNA, the 3'-Qverhangs can be also stabilized against degradation. In one embodiment^ the overhangs are stabilized by including purine nucleotides, such as adenosine or guanosine nucleotides. Alternatively, substitution of pyrimidine nucleotides by modified analogues, e.g., substitution of uridine nucleotides in the 3'-overhangs with 2'-deoxythymidine, is tolerated and does not affect the efficiency of RNAi degradation. In particular, the absence of a 2'-hydroxyl in the 2*-deoxythymidine significantly enhances the nuclease resistance of the 3'-overhang in tissue culture medium.<br>
The sense and antisense strands of the siRNA can comprise two complementary, single-stranded RNA molecules or can comprise a single molecule in which two complementary portions are base-paired and are covalently linked by a single-stranded "hairpin" area. That is, the sense region and antisense region can be covalently connected via a linker molecule. The linker molecule can be a polynucleotide or non--nucleotide linker. Without wishina to be bound by anv theory, it IS believed that rhe hairpin area of the iatrer type of siRNA molecule is cleaved intraeellularly by the "Dicer" protein (or its equivalent) to form a siRNA of two individual base-paired RNA molecules.<br>
As used herein, "target mRNA" refers to an RNA molecule that is a target for downregulation.<br><br>
siRNA can be expressed from pol III expression vectors without a change in targeting site,  as expression of<br><br>
siRNA according to the invention can be targeted to any stretch of approximately 19-25 contiguous nucleotides in any of the target mRNA sequences (the "target sequence"). Techniques for selecting target sequences for siRNA are given, for example;, in Tuschl T, et al., "The siRNA User Guide", revised Oct. 11, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. "The siRNA User Guide" is available on the world wide. web at &amp; website maintained by Dr. Thomas Tuschl, Laboratory of RNA Molecular Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, USA, and can be found by accessing the website of the Rockefeller University and searching with the keyword 'siRNA"* Thus, the sense strand of the present siRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence substantially identical to any contiguous stretch of about 19 to about 2 5 nucleotides in the target mRNA.<br>
Generally, a target sequence on the target mRNA can be<br><br>
the targei: mRNA, preferably beginning 50 to 100 nt downstream (i.e., in the 3'-direction) from the start codon. The target sequence can, however, be located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions, or in the region nearby the start codon.<br>
siRNA can be obtained using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, siRNA can be chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced<br><br><br>
Preferably, siRNA is chemically synthesized using appropriately protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer. siRNA can be synthesized as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.<br>
Alternatively, siRNA can also be expressed from recombinant circular or linear DNA plasmids using any suitable promoter. Such embodiments are included according to the present invention when reference is made herein " to the administration of siRNA or the incorporation of siRNA into pharmaceutical compositions. Suitable promoters for expressing siRNA of the invention from a plasmid include, for example, the U6 or HI RNA pol III promoter sequences and the cytomegalovirus promoter.<br>
Selection	of other suitable promoters is within , the<br>
skill in	the art.  The recombinant plasmids of the<br>
inventior can  also comprise indijcible or  regulatable<br>
promoters	for expression of the siRNA in a pamicuiar<br>
tissue or	in a particular intracellular environment .<br>
The siRNA expressed from recombinant plasmids can either be isolated from cultured cell expression systems by standard techniques, or can be expressed intracellularly. The use of recombinant plasmias 1:0 deliver siRNA to cells in vivo is discussed in more detail below. siRNA can be expressed from a recombinant<br><br><br>
Selection of plasmids suitable for expressing siRNA, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the siRNA into the plasmid, and methods of delivering the recombinant plasmid to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art,<br>
siRNA can also be expressed from recombinant viral vectors intracellularly in vivo. The recombinant viral vectors comprise sequences encoding the siRNA and any suitable promoter for expressing the siRNA sequences. The recombinant viral vectors can also comprise inducible or regulatable promoters for expression of the siRNA in a particular tissue or in a particular intracellular environment. siRNA can be expressed from a recombinant viral vector either as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.<br>

The term 'protein" refers to large peptides, preferably to peptides with more than 100 amino acid residues, but in general the terms "peptides" and "proteins" are synonyms and are used interchanceably herein.<br>
Preferably,-   the  proteins  and  peptides  described<br><br>
according to the invention have been isolated. The terms  'isolated protein' or 'isolated peptide" mean<br>
natural environment. An isolated protein or peptide may be in an essentially purified state. The term "essentially purified" means that the protein or peptide is essentially free of other substances with which it is associated in nature or in vivo.<br>
Such proteins and peptides may be used, for example, in producing antibodies and in an immunological or diagnostic assay or as therapeutics. Proteins and peptides described according to the invention may be isolated from biological samples such as tissue or cell homogenates and may also be expressed recombinantly in a multiplicity of pro- or eukaryotic expression systems.<br>
For   the   purposes   of   the   present   invention, "derivatives" of a protein or peptide or of an amino acid sequence comprise amino acid insertion variants, amino  acid  deletion  variants  and/or  amino  acid substitution variants.<br>
Amino acid insertion variants comprise amino- and/or carboxy-terminal fusions and also insertions of single or two or more amino acids in a particular amino acid sequence.    In the case of amino acid sequence variants<br>
having an insertion, one or more amino acid residues are inserteG into a particular site in an amino acid sequence, although random insertion with appropriate screening of the resulting product is also possible. Amino acid deletion variants are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acids from the sequence. Amino acid substitution variants are characterized by at least one residue in the sequence being removed and another residue being inserted m its place. Preference is given to the modifications being in positions in the amino acid sequence which are not conserved between<br><br><br>
Owing to their particular part in protein architecture, three residues are shown in brackets. Gly is the only residue without a side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain. Pro has an unusual geometry which greatly restricts the chain. Cys can form a disulfide bridge,<br>
The amino acid variants described above may be readily prepared with the aid of known peptide synthesis techniques  such  as  for  example,  by  solid  phase<br>
svn thesis (Merrifield, 1964) and similar methods or by recombinant DNA manipulation. The manipulation of DNA sequences for preparing proteins and peptides having substitutions r insertions or deletions, is described in detail in Sambrook ez  al,    (1989), for example.<br>
According to the invention, 'derivatives" of proteins and peptides also comprise single or multiple substitutions, deletions ana/or aaditions of any molecules associated with the protein or peptide, such as carbohydrates, lipids and/or proteins or peptides.<br><br>
The term "derivative" also extends to all functional chemical equivalents of said proteins and peptides.<br>
According to the invention,  a part or  fragment  of a tumor-associated  antigen preferably has  a  functional property of the protein or peptide from which it has been derived. Such functional properties comprise the interaction with antibodies the interaction with other peptides or proteins^ the selective binding of nucleic acids and an enzymatic activity. A particular property is the ability to form a complex with MHC molecules and, where appropriate, generate an immune response, preferably by stimulating cytotoxic or T helper cells. A part or fragment of a tumor-associated antigen of the invention preferably comprises a sequence of at least 6, in particular at least 8, at least 10, at least 12, at least 15, at least 20, at least 30 or at least 50, consecutive  amino  acids  of  the  tumor-associated antigen.  A part  or  fragment  of  a  tumor-associated antigen  of  the  invention  preferably  comprises  a sequence of up to 8, in particular up to 10, up to 12, up to 15, up to 20, up to 30 or up to 55, consecutive amino acids of the tumor-associated antigen. A part or fragment of a tumor-associated antigen is preferably a part of the tumor-associated antigen which corresponds to the non-transmembrane portion,  in particular the extracellular portion of the antigen, or is comprised thereof.<br>
Preferred par LS or fragments of a iiumor-associaLed antigen according to the invention are in particular suitable for the stimulation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vivo but also for the production of expanded and stimulated T-lymphocytes for the therapeutic adoptive transfer ex vivo.<br>
A part or a fragment: of a nucleic acia coaing for a tumor-associated antigen relates according to the invention to the part of the nucleic acid, which codes<br><br>
at least for the tumor-associated antigen and/or for a part or a fragment of said tumor-associated antigen, as<br>
coding for a tumor-associated antigen is preferably that part of the nucleic acid corresponding to the open reading frame,<br>
According to the invention^ particular embodiments ought to involve providing "dominant negative" proteins or peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens. A dominant negative protein or peptide is an inactive protein or peptide variant which, by way of interacting with the cellular machinery displaces an active protein or peptide from its interaction with the cellular machinery or which competes with the active protein or peptide^ thereby reducing the effect of said active protein.<br>
Antisera which contain specific antibodies specifically binding to the target protein can be prepared by various standard processes; see for example, ''Monoclonal Antibodies; A Practical Approach" by Philip Shepherd, Christopher Dean ISBN 0-19-963722-9; 'Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual" by Ed Harlow, David Lane, ISBN: 087 9693142 and 'Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual: Portable Protocol NO" by Edward Harlow, David Lane, Ed Harlow ISBN 0879695447, Thereby it is also possible to generate affine and specific antibodies which recognize complex membrane protei ns in their native form (Azorsa etal., J. Immunol. MeL.hods 22 9: 35-4 8, 1999; Anderson et al. , J. Immunol. 143: 18 99-1904, 1989; Gardsvoll, J. Immunol. Methods 234: 107-116, 2000). This is in particular relevant for the preparation of antibodies which are zo be used therapeutically, .but also for many diagnostic applications. In this respect, it is possible to immunize with the whole protein, with extracellular partial sequences as well as with cells which express the target molecule in physiologically folded form.<br><br><br>
It is known that only a small part of an antibody<br>
molecule, the paratope, is involved in binding of the<br>
antibody to its epitope (of. Clark, W.R. (1986) , The<br>
Experimental Foundations of Modern Immunology, Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, Inc., New York; Roitt, I. (1991), Essential<br>
Immunology,	7th   Edition,    Blackwell   Scientific<br>
Publications, Oxford). The pFc' and Fc regions are, for example, effectors of the complement cascade but are not involved in antigen binding. An antibody from which the pFc' region has been enzymatically removed or which has been produced without the pFc' region, referred to as F{ab')2 fragment, carries both antigen binding sites of a complete antibody. Similarly, an antibody from which the Fc region has been enzymatically removed or which has been produced without said Fc region, referred to as Fab fragment, carries one antigen binding site of an intact antibody molecule. Furthermore, Fab fragments consist of a covalently bound light chain .of an antibody and oart of the heavy-chain or said antibody referreo LO as Fc. Tne r'c fragments are the main determinants of antibody specificity (a single Fd fragment can be associated with up to ren different light chains, without altering the specificity of the antibody) and Fd fragments, when isolated, retain the ability to bind to an epitope.<br>
Located within the antigen-binding part 01 an antiboay are complementary-determining regions (CDRs) which interact  directly  with  the  antigen  epitope  and<br><br><br>
determining regions (CDRl to CDR3) . The CDRs and, in particular, the CDR3 regions and, still more particularly the CDRS region of the heavy chain are responsible to a large extent for antibody specificity*<br>
Non-CDR regions of a mammalian antibody are icnown to be able to be replaced by similar regions of antibodies with the same or a different specificity, with the specificity for the epitope of the original antibody being retained. This made possible the development of '"humanized" antibodies in which nonhuman CDRs are covalently linked to human FR and/or Fc/pFc' regions to produce a functional antibody.<br>
As another example, WO 92/04381 describes the production and use of humanized murine RSV antibodies in which at least part of the murine FR regions have been replaced with FR regions of a human origin. Antibodies of this kind, including fragments of intact antibodies with antigen-binding capability, are often referred to as 'chimeric" antibodies-<br>
According to the invention, the term 'antibody" also includes Ffab' ) -, Fab,. Fv, and Fd fraaments of antiboazes, chimeric anmbodies, in wnich trie Fc and/or FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with homologous human or nonhuman sequences, chimeric F(ab')2-fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with homologous human or nonhuman sequencesr chimeric Fab-fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDRl and/or CDR2 and/or light chain-CDR3 regions have been replaced with  homologous  human  or  nonhuman  sequences,  and<br><br><br>
The invention also comprises proteins and peptides which bind specifically to tumor-associated antigens. Binding substances of this kind may be provided, for example by degenerate peptide libraries which may be prepared simply in solution in an immobilized form or as phage-display libraries. It is likewise possible to prepare combinatorial libraries of peptides with one or more amino acids. Libraries of peptoids and nonpeptidic synthetic residues may also be prepared.<br>
Antibodies may also be coupled to specific	diagnostic<br>
substances for displaying cells and tissues	expressing<br>
tumor-associated antigens. They may also be	coupled to<br>
therapeutically useful substances.<br>
Diagnostic substances include any label that functions to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer); (iii) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility,  by charge,  hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (iv) provide a capture moiety,  e.g.,  affinity,  antibody/antigen,  or ionic ccmplexation.  Suitable as label are structures, such  as  fiuorescenr   labels,   luminescent   labels, chromophore  labels,  radioisotopic  labels,  isotopic labels,  preferably stable  isotopic  labels,  isobaric labels, enzyme labels, particle labels, in particular metal  particle  labels,  magnetic  particle  labels, polymer particle labels, small organic molecules such as biotin,  ligands of receptors or binding molecules such  as  cell  adhesion  proteins  or  lectins,  label-sequences comprising nucleic acids and/or amino acid residues which  can be  detected by use  of binding<br><br><br>
According to the invention, the term 'therapeutically useful substance" means any molecule which may exert a therapeutic  effect.  According  to  the  invention,  a therapeutically   useful   substance   is   preferably selectively guided to a cell which expresses one or more tumor-associated antigens and includes anticancer agents,  radioactive iodine-labeled compounds,  toxins, cytostatic or cytolytic drugs, etc. Anticancer agents comprise, for example, aminoglutethimide, azathioprine, bleomycin sulfate, busulfan, carmustine, chlorambucil, cisplatin,        cyclophosphamide,        cyclosporine, cytarabidine,  dacarbazine,  dactinomycin,  daunorubin, doxorubicin,     taxol,     etoposide,     fluorouracil, interferon-a, lomustine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, mitotane,  procarbazine HCl,  thioguanine,  vinblastine sulfate  and  vincristine  sulfate,  Other  anticancer agents  are described,  for example,  in  Goodman  and Gilman,  'The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", 8th  Edition,  19 90,  McGraw-Hill,  Inc.,  in  particular Chapter 52  iAnrineoplastic Agents  (Paul Calabresi anc Bruce A.  Chabner) ,  Toxins may be proteins  such as pokeweed antiviral protein,  cholera toxin,  pertussis toxin,  ricin,  gelonin,  abrin, diphtheria exotoxin or Pseudomonas   exotoxin. Toxin residues may also be high energy-err.emitting radionuclides such as cobalt-60.<br>
The term 'major histocompatibility complex" or 'MHC" relates to a complex of genes present in all vertebrates. MHC proteins or molecules are involved in<br><br>
signaling between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells in normal immune reactions by binding peptides<br><br>
(TCR) . MHC molecules bind peptides within an intra cellular process d.ng compartment and present these peptides on the surface of antigen presenting cells for recognition by T cells. The human MHC region also termed HLA is located on chromosome 6 and includes the class I and class II region. In one preferred embodiment of all aspects of the invention an MHC molecule is an HLA molecule,<br>
"Reduce" or 'inhibit" as used herein means the ability to cause an overall decrease, preferably of 20% or greater, more preferably of 50% or greater, and most preferably of 75% or greater, in the level, e.g, in the level of protein or mRNA as compared to a reference sample (e * g. , a sample not treated with siRNA) . This reduction or inhibition of RNA or protein expression can occur through targeted mRNA cleavage or degradation. Assays for protein expression or nucleic acid expression are known in the art and include, for example, ELISA, western blot analysis for protein expression, and northern blotting or RNase protection assays for RNA.<br>
The term "patient" means according , to the invention a<br><br>
particular a mammal such as a cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat/ dog, cat or a rodent such as a mouse and rat. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the patient is a human being.<br>
"Abnormal expression" means according to the ■■ invention compared to the state in a healthy individual.<br><br>
According to the invention the term "increased' or 'increased amount" preferably refers to an increase by<br><br>
or at least 100%. The amount of a substance is also increased in a test sample such as a biologica] sample compared to a reference sample if it is detectable in the test sample but absent or not detectable in the reference sample,<br>
According to the invention, the term "disease" refers to any pathological state in which tumor-associated antigens are expressed or abnormally expressed, "Abnormal expression" means according to the invention that expression is altered, preferably increased, compared to the state in a healthy individual. An increase in expression refers to an increase by at least 10%, in particular at least 20%, at least 50% or at least 100%, In one embodiment, the tumor-associated antigen is expressed only in tissue of a diseased individual, while expression in a healthy individual is repressed- One example of such a disease is cancer, wherein the term 'cancer" according to the invention comprises leukemias, seminomas, melanomas, teratomas, lymphomas, neuroblastomas, gliomas, rectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, adrenal cancer, thyroid cancer, blood cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the brain, cervical cancer, intestinal cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer; stomach cancer, intestine cancer,. head and neck cancer, gastroin"cestinal cancer, iympe node cancer, esophagus cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, ear, nose and throat (ENT) cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cancer of the uterus, ovarian cancer and lung cancer and the matastases thereof. Examples thereof are lung carcinomas, mamma carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, colon carcincsmas, renal cell carcinomas, cervical carcinomas, or metastases of the cancer types or tumors described above . The term cancer according to the invention also<br><br>
comprises cancer metastases.<br>
By "tumor" is meant an abnormal Group of cells or tissue that grows by a rapid uneontrolied cellular proliferation and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated the new growth cease. Tumors show partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue, and usually form a distinct mass of tissue, which may be either benign or malignant•<br>
By "metastasis" is meant the spread of cancer cells from its original site to another part of the body- The formation of metastasis is a very complex process and depends on detachment of malignant cells from the primary tumor, invasion of the extracellular matrix, penetration of the endothelial basement membranes to enter the body cavity and vessels, and then, after being transported by the blood, infiltration of target organs, Finally, the growth of a new tumor at the target site depends on angiogenesis. Tumor metastasis often occurs even after the removal of the primary tumor because tumor cells or components may remain and develop metastatic potential. In one embodiment, the term ''metastasis" according to the invention relates to "distant metastasis" which relates to a metastasis which is remote from the primary tumor and the regional lymph node system.<br>
According to the invention, a biological sample may be a tissue sample, including bodily fluids, and/or a cellular sample and may be obtained in the conventional<br><br>
biopsy, and by taking blood, bronchial aspirate, sputum, urine, feces or other body fluids. According to<br><br>
the invention, the term 'biological sample" also includes fractions of biological samples,<br>
According to the invention, the term "immunoreact i ve cel1" means a cell which can mature into an immune cell (such as B cell, T helper cell, or cytolytic T cell) with suitable stimulation. Immunoreactive cells comprise 0034 hematopoietic stem cells, immature and mature T cells and immature and mature B cells. If production of cytolytic or T helper cells recognizing a tumor-associated antigen is desired, the immunoreactive cell is contacted with a cell expressing a tumor-associated antigen under conditions which favor production, differentiation and/or selection of cytolytic T cells and of T helper cells. The differentiation of T cell precursors into a cytolytic T cell, when exposed to an antigen, is similar to clonal selection of the immune system.<br>
The terms 'T cell" and "T lymphocyte" are used interchangeably herein and include T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells which comprise cytolytic T cells.<br>
Some therapeutic methods are based on a reaction of the immune system of a patient, which results in a lysis of antigen-presenting cells such as cancer cells which present one or more tumor-associated antigens. In this connection, for example autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for a complex of a tumor-associated antigen and an MHC molecule are adminisrerec to a patient having a cellular abnormality. The production of such cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro is known. An example of a method of differentiating T cells can be found in WO^A-9633265. Generally, a sample containing cells such as blood cells is taken from the patient and the cells are contacted with a cell which presents the complex and which can cause propagamon oi cytotoxic T lymphocytes (e.g. dendritic cells). The target cell may be a transfected cell such as a COS<br><br>
cell,  These  transfeeted  cells  present  the  desired complex  on  their  surface  and,  when  contacted  with<br><br>
Iymphocytes are then administered to the patient-<br>
In another method of selecting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, fluorogenic tetramers of MHC class I molecule/peptide complexes are used for obtaining specific clones of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Altman et al,, Science 274:94-96, 1996; Dunbar et al,, Curr.   Biol.   8:413-416, 1998).<br>
The present invention also includes therapeutic methods referred  to  as  adoptive  transfer  (Greenberg,  J. Immunol.     136(5) :1917,  1986;  Riddel  et  al. , Science 257:238, 1992; Lynch et al,, EuT.    J.    Immunol.    21:1403-1410,  1991;  Kast  et  al. , Cell     59:603-614,  198 9), wherein  cells presenting the  desired complex  (e.g. dendritic  cells)  are  combined  with  cytotoxic  T lymphocytes of the patient to be treated, resulting in a propagation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The propagated   cytotoxic   T   lymphocytes   are   then administered to a patient having a cellular anomaly characterized by particular abnormal cells presenting the specific complex. The cytotoxic T lymphocytes then lyse the abnormal cells, thereby achieving a desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Furthermore, ceils presenting trie desirec ccmple:-: le. z. . dendritic cells) may be combined with cytotoxic T lymphocytes of healthy individuals or another species (e.g. mouse) which may result in propagation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes with high affinity. The high affinity T cell receptor of these propagated specific T lymphocytes may be cloned and optionally humanizea to a different extent, and tne T ceil receptors thus obtained then transduced via gene transfer, for example using retroviral vectors, into T<br><br>
cells  of  patients.  Adoptive  transfer  may  then  be<br>
carried  out   using   these   genetically   altered   T<br>
70, 2001; Kessels et al,, Nat Immunol. 2:957-61, 2001).<br>
Adoptive transfer is not the only form of therapy which can be applied according to the invention. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes may also be generated In vivo in a manner known per se, One method uses nonproliferative cells expressing the complex. The cells used here will be those which usually express the complex, such as irradiated tumor cells or cells transfected with one or both genes necessary for presentation of the complex (i.e. the antigenic peptide and the presenting MHC molecule). Another preferred form is the introduction of the tumor-associated antigen in the form of recombinant RNA which may be introduced into cells by liposomal transfer or by electroporation, for example, The resulting cells present the complex of interest and are recognized by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes which then propagate.<br>
A similar effect can be achieved by combining the. tumor-associated antigen or a fragment thereof with an adjuvant in order to make incorporation into antigen-presenting cells in vivo possible. The tumor-associated antigen or a fragment thereof may be represented as protein, as DNA (e.g. within a vector) or as RNA. The<br><br>
thereof may be presented without the need for further processing. The latter is the case in particular, if -hese can bind to MHC molecules. Preference is given to administration forms in which the complete antigen is processed in vivo by a dendriric cell, since this may also produce T helper cell responses which are needed for an effective immune response (Ossendorp et al, , Immunol Lett. 74:75-9 2000; Ossendorp et al., J. Exp. Med.    187:693-702, 1998). In general, it is possible to<br><br>
administer an effective amount of the tumor-associated ' antigen  to  a  patient  by  intradermal  injection,  for<br><br>
intranodally into a lymph node (Maloy et al., Proc Natl Acad  Sci   USA   98:3299-303, 2001).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment described according to the invention may also be used for immunization or vaccination to therapeutically treat or prevent a disease described herein. According to the invention, the terms "immunization" or "vaccination" preferably relate to an increase in or activation of an immune response to an antigen. It is possible to us.e animal models for testing an immunizing effect on cancer by using a tumor-associated antigen or a nucleic acid coding therefor. For example, human cancer cells may be introduced into a mouse to generate a tumor, and one or more nucleic acids coding for tumor-associated antigens may be administered. The effect on the cancer cells (for example reduction in tumor size) may be measured as a measure for the effectiveness of an immunization by the nucleic acid.<br>
As part of the composition for an immunization or a vaccination, preferably one or more tumor-associated antigens or stimulating fragments thereof are administered together with one or more adjuvants for<br>
inducing an immune response or for increasina an immune response- An adjuvant is a substance which is incorporated into the antigen or administered together with the latter and which enhances the immune response. Adjuvants may enhance the immune response by providing an antigen reservoir (extracellularly or in macrophages), activating macrophages and/or stimulating particular lymphocytes. Adjuvants are known and comprise in a nonlimiting way monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, SmithKline Beecham), saponins such as QS21 (SmithKline  Beecham),   DQS21   (SmithKline  Beecham;<br><br>
wo 96/33739) ,  QS7, QS17,  QS18 and QS-Ll  (So et al. , Hoi.   Cells  7: 178-186,   1997),   incomplete  Freund s<br>
montanide, alum, CpG oligonucleotides (cf. Kreig et 3.1 . r Nature 374:546-9, 1995) and various water-in-oil emulsions prepared from biologically degradable oils such as sgualene and/or tocopherol. Preferably, the peptides are administered in a mixture with DQS21/MPL. The ratio of DQS21 to MPL is typically about 1:10 to 10:1, preferably about 1:5 to 5:1 and in particular about 1:1. For administration to humans, a vaccine formulation typically contains DQS21 and MPL in a range from about 1 µg to about 100 µg.<br>
Other substances which stimulate an immune response of the patient may also be administered. It is possible,-for example, to use cytokines in a vaccination, owing to their regulatory properties on lymphocytes. Such cytokines comprise, for example, interleukin-12 (IL-12) which was shown to increase the protective actions of vaccines (cf. Science 268:1432-1434, 1995), GM-CSF and IL-18.<br>
There are a number of compounds which enhance an immune response and which therefore may be used in a vaccination. Said compounds comprise costimulating molecules provided in the form of proteins or nucleic acids such as B7-1 and B7-2 (CD80 and CD86, resoectively).<br>
The invention also provides for administration of nucleic acids proteins or peptides. Proteins and peptides may be administered in a manner known per se. In one embodiment, nucleic acids are administered by ex vivo methods, i.e, by remox'-ing cells from a patient, genetic modification of said cells in order to incorporate  a  tumor-associated antigen and reintroduction of the altered cells into the patient. This generally comprises introducing a functional copy<br><br>
of a gene into the cells of a patient in vitro and reintroducing the genetically altered cells  into the<br>
functional control of regulatory elements which allow the gene to be expressed in the genetically altered cells. Transfection and transduction methods are known to the skilled worker. The invention also provides for administering nucleic acids in vivo by using vectors such as viruses and target--controlled liposomes. If according to the invention reference is made to the administration or incorporation into pharmaceutical compositions of nucleic acids this includes embodiments wherein the nucleic acid is present in such vectors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a virus or viral vector for administering a nucleic acid coding for a tumor-associated antigen is selected from the group consisting of adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses^ pox viruses, including vaccinia virus and attenuated pox viruses^ Semliki Forest virus, retroviruses, Sindbis virus and Ty virus-like particles. Particular preference is given to adenoviruses and retroviruses. The retroviruses are typically replication-deficient (i.e. they are incapable of generating infectious particles).<br>
Methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells in vitro   or in   vivo   comprise transfection of nucleic acid<br>
cal cium phosphate precioitates, transfection of nucleic acids associared witn DEA£, transfection or infection with the above viruses carrying the nucleic acids of interest, liposome-mediated transfection, and the like. In particular embodiments, preference is given to directing the nucleic acid to particular cells, In such embodiments^ a carrier used for adrranistering a nucleic acid to a cell (e/g. a retrovirus or a liposome) may have a bound target control molecule. For example, a molecule such as an antibody specific for a surface membrane protein on the target cell or a ligand for a<br><br>
receptor on the target cell may be incorporated into or attached  to  the  nucleic  acid  carrier.  Preferred<br><br>
tumor-associated ant iutigen.If adiministration of a nucleic acid via liposomes is desired, proteins bindinq to a surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be incorporated into the liposome formulation in order to make target control and/or uptake possible, Such proteins comprise capsid proteins or fragments thereof which are specific for a particular cell type antibodies to proteins which are internalized proteins addressing an intracellular site, and the like.<br>
The therapeutic compositions of the invention may be administered in pharmaceutical!y compatible preparations. Such preparations may usually contain pharmaceutically compatible concentrations of salts, buffer substances, preservatives, carriers, supplementing immunity-enhancing substances such as adjuvants, e.g. CpG oligonucleotides, cytokines, chemokines, saponin, GM-CSF and/or RNA and, where appropriate, other therapeutically active compounds,<br>
The therapeutically active compounds of the invention may  be  administered  via  any  conventional  route, including by injection or infusion. The administration may be carried out, for example, orally, intravenously,<br><br>
therapeutically administered by way of a lung aerosol, Antisense nucleic acids are preferably administered by slow intravenous administration .<br>
The compositions of the invention are administered in effective amounts. An 'effective amount' refers to the amount which achieves a desired reacnion or a aesrred effect alone or together with further doses. In the case of treatment of a particular disease or of a<br><br>
particular condition characterized by expression of one or more tumor-associated antigens, the desired reaction<br>
disease. This comprises slowing down the procress of the disease and, in particular, interrupting or reversing the progress of the disease. The desired reaction in a treatment of a disease or of a condition may also be delay of the onset or a prevention of the onset of said disease or said condition. According to the invention, a diagnosis or treatment of cancer may also include the diagnosis or treatment of cancer metastases which have already formed or will form. According to the invention, the term "treatment" comprises therapeutic and prophylactic treatment, i.e. prevention.<br>
An effective amount of a composition of the invention will depend on the condition to be treated, the severeness of the disease, the individual parameters of the patient, including age, physiological condition, size and weight, the duration of treatment, the type of an accompanying therapy (if present), the specific route of administration and similar factors.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably sterile and contain an effective amount of the therapeutically active substance to generate the desired reaction or the desired effect.<br>
The doses administered of the compositions of the invention may depend on various parameters such as the type of administration, the condition of the patient, the desired period of administration, etc, In the case that a reaction in a patient is insuf f icienr with an initial dose, higher' doses (or effectively higher doses achieved by a different, more localized route of administration) may be used.<br>
Generally,  doses of the tumor-associated antigen of<br><br>
from 1 ng to 1 mg, preferably from 10 ng to 100 µg are formulated  and  administered  for  a  treatment  or  for<br><br>
administration of nucieic acids {DNA and RNA) coding for tumor-associated antigens is desired, doses of from 1 ng to 0.1 mg are formulated and administered.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are generally administered in pharmaceutically compatible amounts and in pharmaceutically compatible compositions, The term "pharmaceutically  compatible" refers to a nontoxic material which does not interact with the action of the active component of the pharmaceutical composition. Preparations of this kind may usually contain salts, buffer substances, preservatives, carriers and, where appropriate, other therapeutically active compounds. When used in medicine, the salts should be pharmaceutically compatible. However, salts which are not pharmaceutically compatible may used for preparing pharmaceutically compatible salts and are included in the invention. Pharmacologically and pharmaceutically compatible salts of this kind comprise in a nonlimiting way those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, citric, formic, ma Ionic, succinic acids, and the like. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may also be prepared as alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium - sains, potassium salts or calcium salus.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a pharmaceutically compatible carrier. According to the invention, the term 'pharmaceutically compatible carrier' refers to one or more comparible solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for administrarion to humans. The term "carrier" refers to an organic or inorganic component, of a natural or synthetic nature,<br><br>
in which the active component is combined in order to facilitate   application.   The   components   of   the<br>
such that no interaction occurs which substantial J, y impairs the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain suitable buffer substances such as acetic acid in a salt, citric acid in a salt, boric acid in a salt and phosphoric acid in a salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may, where appropriate, also contain suitable preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, paraben and thimerosal,<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are usually provided in a uniform dosage form and may be prepared in a manner known per se. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form of capsules, tablets, lozenges, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs or in the form of an emulsion, for example-<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral administration usually comprise a sterile aqueous or nonaqueous preparation of the active compound, which is preferably isotonic to the blood of the recipient. Examples of compatible carriers and solvents are Ringer solution and isotonic sodium chloride so] uti on . In addition,, usually sterxle, rixed oils are used as solution or suspension medium.<br>

Material and methods<br>
The techniques and methods mentioned herein are carried out in a manner known per se and are described, for example, in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y, All methods including the use of kits and reagents are carried out according to the manufacturers' information.<br>
RNA extraction, preparation of poly-d{T) primed cDNA and conventional RT-PCR analysis<br>
Total RNA was extracted from native tissue material by using guanidium isothiocyanate' as chaotropic agent (Chomczynski &amp; Sacchi, Anal. Biochem. 162:156-9, 1987). After extraction with acidic phenol and precipitation with isopropanol, said RNA was dissolved in DEPC-treated water.<br>
First strand cDNA synthesis from 4 µg of total RNA was carried out in a 20 µl reaction mixture by means of Superscript II (Invitrogen) , according to the manufacturer's information. The primer used was a dT(18) oligonucleotide. Integrity and quality of the cDNA were checked by amplification of p53 in a 30 cycle PCR ( (SEQ ID NO:33,34)), hybridization temperature 67"C).<br>
An archive of f j_rst strand cDNA was prepared from a number of normal tissues and tumor entities. For expression studies, 0,5 µl of these cDNAs was amplified in a 30 µl reaction mixture, using GOI-specific primers (see below) and 1 U of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) . Each reaction mixture contained 150µM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of each primer and 3 µl of 10 x reaction buffer. The primers were selected so as to be located in two different exons, and elimination of the interference by contaminating genomic DNA as the reason for false-<br><br>
positive results was conrirmea oy testing nonreverse-transcribed DNA as template. After 15 minutes at 95°C<br>
PCR wern carried out (0.5 min at 94°C, 0.5 min at the particular hybridization temperature, 0.5 min at 1?/Q. and final elongation at 72°C for 6 min).<br>
20 fil of this reaction were fractionated and analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.<br>
Preparatiion of randoan hexamer-prined cDNA. and quantitative real-time PCR<br>
The expression of several genes was quantified by real¬time PCR. The PCR products were detected using SYBR Green as intercalating reporter dye. The reporter fluorescence of SYBR Green is suppressed in solution and the dye is active only after binding to double-stranded DNA fragments. The increase in the SYBR Green fluorescence as a result of the specific amplification using GOl^specific primers after each PCR cycle is utilized for quantification. Expression of the target gene is quantified absolutely or relative to the expression of a control gene with constant expression in the tissues to be investigated. Expression was measured after standardization of the samples against 18s RNA as so-called housekeeping gene using the AA-Ct method (PE Biosystems, USA). The reactions were carried out in duplicates and determined in triplicates. The QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized with random primers (Invitrogen; using the protocol described above. Each 5 pi portions of the diluted cDNA were employed in a total volume of 30 ]il for the PCR: sense primer 300 nM, antisense primer 300 nM; initial denaturation 95°C for 15 min; 95°C for 30 sec; annealing for 30 sec; 72°C for 30 sec; 40 cycles. The sequences of the primers used are indicated in the respective examples.<br><br>
Cloning and sequence analysis<br>
Cloning of full-lengths and gene fragments took place<br><br>
corresponding antigenes were arriplified using the proofreading polymerase pfu (Stratagene). After corapletion of the PCR, adenosine was ligated by means of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase to the ends of the amplicon in order to clone the fragments in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions into the TOPO-TA vector. The sequencing was carried out by a commercial service, The sequences were analysed using conventional prediction programs and algorithms-<br>
Cell proliferation analysis<br>
24 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes 1x104 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with varying concentrations of FCS for 4 8 h- Proliferation was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of BrdU into newly synthesized DNA strands using the DELFIA cell proliferation Kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Wallac Victor2 multi-label counter (Perkin Elmer).<br>
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis<br>
Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with FCS in varying concentrations, harvested after 4 8 h and stained with propidiumiodide prior to flowcytometrie<br>
S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle were quantified using CellQuest-Software (Becton Dickinson),<br>
Cell migration<br>
Cell  migration  assays  were  conducted  in  transwe11<br>
with cells cultured in serum-free medium for 12h prior to the experiments. For siRNA experiments cells were<br><br>
transferred  to  serum-free  conditions  24  h  after transfection with siRNA duplexes as    described above.<br>
added to the upper chamber. The bottom chambers contained 8 00 p]. culture rriedium supplemented with either PCS, PDGF-3B (Sigma-Aldrich) or SDF-la/CXCL12 (R&amp;D Systems) as chemoattractants. After 2 4 hours cells that had migrated to the bottom side of the membrane were fixed in ice-cold methanol; membranes were excised, placed on microscope slides and mounted with Hoechst (Dako) for fluorescence microscopy. Cells in five random visual fields (lOOx magnification) were counted for each membrane. All experiments were done in triplicates. Effects on chemokinesis of cells was analyzed using the same experimental setup with (i) no chemoattractant added to the upper and lower chamber and (ii) with chemoattractant added to both the upper and lower chamber.<br>
In vitro invasion assay<br>
In vivo invasion assays were conducted in transwe11 chambers with 8.0 \im pore membranes (BD Biosciences) with cells cultured in serum-free medium for 12h prior to the experiments. Upper chambers were prepared with lOOial of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted to 1 mg/ml in serum free medium. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 5h for gelling. For siRNA experiments cells were transferred to serum-free conditions 24 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes as described above. 1x105 cells in 400 µl serum-free culture medium were added to the upper chamber. The bottom chambers contained 800 µl culture medium supplemented with FCS as chemoattractant.

Example 1: Identl£icat:ion of ISC-468 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-468 (SEQ ID N0:1) encodes a protein of 212 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) and with a molecular weight of 23,6 kDa.<br>
It has been previously described as placenta-specific protein expressed during pregnancy (Fant et al., Mol Reprod Dev.   63:430-6, 2002)<br>
The protein is predicted to have a cleavable signal peptide from aa 1-23, followed by a short putative transmembrane domain (aa 25-47) as analysed by bioinformatics tools (TMpred, SOUSI). The remaining protein is predicted to be extracellular and can therefore be used according to the invention as target structure for monoclonal antibodies.<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO: 3, 4) for ISC-468 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues. As expected, placenta was confirmed as the only healthy tissue expressing   this   gene   (fig.l).   No   significant<br><br>
normal organ tissue. Most surprisingly, when cancer specimen were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in a number of different tumor types, including colon, pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, lung, breast, ovrian, headS&amp;neck, kidney, prostate and liver carcinomas (fig.1 and 2 as<br><br>

The selective and high expression of ISC-468 transcripts in tumors was not previously known and can be utilized' according to the invention for molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR for detecting disseminating tumor cells in the serum and bone marrow and for detecting metastases in other tissues. This molecule can be further used as specific target for therapeutic approaches.<br>
The following peptides, inter alia, were selected for producing ISC-4 68 specific antibodies according to the invention: SEQ ID NO:58, 59, 60, 68, 69, 2. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of I3C-46e-eGFP transfected cells (fig,21A).<br><br>
expressing breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT*549 was analyzed by' immunofluorescence analyses. Staining<br><br>
of either MeOH-fixed (fig,21B) or" non-fixed (fig,21C) cells revealed that ISC-4 68 is localized at the plasma<br><br>
staining was confirmed by RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-468 expression, resulting in the loss of plasma mebrane staining.<br>
Furthermore, ISC-468 specific antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis of ISC-468 expression in clinical samples of normal breast and breast carcinomas. Expression of ISC-468 was not detectable in normal breast specimens (fig.22A,B). In contrast^ breast carcinoma specimens showed strong and homogeneous expression of 130-468 (fig.22C,D). Signals were accentuated at the plasmamembrane of the expressing cancer cells, confirming that ISC-468 is a membrane protein selectively expressed in cancfer cells.<br>
The extracellular domains of ISC-468 can be used according to the invention as target structure for immunodiagnosis and therapy by means of monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ISC-468 can be employed according to the invention as vaccine (RNA, DNA, protein, peptides) for inducing tumor-specific immune responses (T and B cell-mediated immune responses) ,<br>
RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-4 58 expression was achieved by transfeetion of cells with siRNA duplexes<br>
specifically targeting TSC-468 mRNA fSEQ In Nos: 70-73; . Transfecrion of endogenously expressing breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-54 9 resulted in stable and specific reduction of ISC-468 mRNA expression (fig.23),<br>
To gain insight into the physiological role of ISC-46B expression several RNAi-based in vitro cell assays were performed, Transfection of breast carcionoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-54 9 with siRNA duplexes resulted in a distinct reduction of cell proliferation compared to<br><br>
the respective controls, as analyzed in a BrdU-based proliferation  assay  (fig-24),  FACS-based  cell  cycle<br><br>
proliferation 'resulted from a Gl/S arrest (tig.25A,B). Additionally, it could be shown that RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-468 profoundly affects the AKT signaling pathway in endogenously expressing cancer cells by inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (fig,26). Furthermore, proliferation of MCF-7 cells was attenuated when cells were incubated with ISC-468 specific antibodies generated against ISC-468 specific peptides (SEQ ID NO:68,69) compared to an irrelevant control antibody (fig.27). These results indicate that ISC-46B is a critical factor for the proliferation of cancer cells presumably by mediating growth factor-induced activation of the AKT signaling pathway and others, ISC-468 itself might represent a receptor, co-receptor or membrane-bound chaperone for growth-factors^ chemokines or other substances,<br>
Furthermore, the impact of ISC-468 expression on the migratory ability of cancer cells was analyzed- RNAi-induced knock-down of ISC-4 68 expression in breastcarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and BT-549 resulted in distinct impairment of chemotaxis, chemokinesis and invasion of the cells, as assessed in transwell migration assays (fig 28A,B,C) . Chemotaxis, chemokinesis and invasion are critical factors for the metastasis of cancer cells to other organs. Therefore, expression of ISC-4 68 in cancer cells mignu be a positive factor for cancer cell metastasis.<br>
In breast carcinomas, it could be shown that expression of ISC-46B is correlated with the estrogen-receptor state of the tumor. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of ISC-468 expression in 60 breast carcinoma samples revealed that estrogen-recepi:or positive breast carcinomas showed significantly higher levels of ISC-468 expression than receptor-negative tumors (fig.29).<br><br>
Accordingly, expression of ISC-4 68 could be induced in<br>
estrogen-receptor positive breast carcinoma cell line<br>
Example 2: Identification of ISC-507 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-507 (SEQ ID N0:5) encodes a 754 aa protein (SEQ ID NO: 6) with a molecular weight of 85,6 kDa. ISC-507 is member of a family of zinc-binding proteins with disintegrin and metalloprotease activities that can function as adhesion proteins and/or endopeptidases. Members of this family have been described as involved in a number , of biologic processes, including fertilization, neurogenesis, muscle development, and immune response (Seals et al., Genes  Dev,   17(l):7-30, 2003)<br>
ISC-507 has one transmembrane domain (aa 671^687), a large N-terminal extracellular and a shorter C-terminal cytoplasmatic region.<br>
ISC-507 expression has been reported to be specifically restricted to mammalian epididymis, the small gland adjacent to the testicle, which is critically involved in maturation of sperm. According to literature, ISC-507 is transferred from the epididymis to the sperm surface and redistributed in the sperm head during acrosome reaction (Adachi et al., Mol Reprod Dev. G 4 : 4 i 4 -11, 2 00 3).<br>
RT-PCR investigations with ISC-507  specific primers<br>
(SEQ ID NO:7, 8) confirmed selective expression in the testis and absence of ISC-507 from any other normal tissue (tab.2, fig,3)^ except weak expression in prostate and lymph node derived tissues (tab.2, fig*4).<br>
However and most surprisingly, we observed expression of ISC-507 in a significant number of prostate cancers<br><br><br>
The absence from toxicity relevant normal tissues and the frequent and significant expression of ISC-507 in prostate cancers make this protein according to the invention a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic marker, This includes according to the invention the detection of disseminated tumor cells  in  serum,  bone marrow,<br>
by means of RT-PCR. In addition, the extracellular domains of ISC-507 can be used according to the invention as target structure for immunodiagnosis and rherapy by means of monoclonal antibodies. In addition,<br>
ISC-507 can be employed according to the invention as vaccine  (RNA,  DNA,  protein,  peptides)  for  inducing<br>
immune responses) .<br><br>
Antibodies for detecting ISC~507 could be produced with following peptides and proteins: SEQIDN0:51, 52,  53,<br>
According to the invention an antibody which binds to ISC-507 might be useful for therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
purposes.<br>

The RT-PCR analysis reveals expression of ISC-466 transcripts in normal placenta,  and weak expression  in  thymus  and  ovary<br><br>
when cancer cell lines were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in a number of tumor types, including breast cancer (fig.50), lung cancer (fig.5C) , ovarian carcinoma (fig.5D) and head and neck- and kidney carcinomas (fig.SB).<br><br><br>
In contrast to the observation, that ISC-4 66 is involved by colorectal carcinomas (Salahshor et al. , BMC Cancer, 5:66, 2005), our investigations reveal ISC-466 according to the invention as diagnostic and therapeutic marker for head &amp; neck, breast, ovarian, prostate cancer and melanoma.<br>
Example 4: Identification of ISC-518 as therapeutic and<br>
diagnostoc cancer target.<br>
ISC-518  (SEQ ID NO:13)  encodes  a 237  aa  translation<br>
product (SEQ ID NO:14). However, no data with regard to<br>
tissue distribution and no connection to cancer is<br>

Most surprisingly, when cancer specimens were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in lung, ovarian, colon and stomach cancer (f ig. 8A-D) . Expression levels are clearly higher ::han expression in normal ovary.<br><br><br><br>
Example 6: Identification of ISC-489 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
ISC-489 (SEQ ID N0:21) encodes a 363 aa translation product (SEQ ID NO:22). The protein is a newly described member of the family of G-protein coupled receptors. However, no data with regard to tissue distribution and no connection to cancer was publically available.<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO:23,24) for ISC-489 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues. The only normal tissues we found to express this gene were placenta and esophagus (weak expression) . In contrast, no significant expression of ISC-489 was detectable in any other normal organ (fig.9A), Most surprisingly, when cancer specimens were investigated, we found high and significant levels of expression in head and neck, and stomach cancers (fig.9B, 9C).<br>

Example 9: Identification of Mem-030 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
Mem-030  (SEQ ID NO: 35)  encodes  a  592  aa  protein<br>
(SEQ ID NO:36) with a molecular weight of 67,9 kDA,<br>
Mem-030 belongs to the GBP-proteins, which are large<br>
GTPases being able to bind GTP, GDP, and GMP and to<br>
catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, as well as GMP<br>
(Cheng  et  al., J    Biol.      Cham.      2 60:15834-9,  198 5).<br>
GTPases play an important role in cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation, signal transduction, and intracellular<br>
protein transportation and are  interferon inducible<br>
(Boehm et al., J Immunol.   161 (12):6715-23, 1998),<br>
Also, Mem-030 counteracts the proliferative effect of<br>
inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, interleukin 1-b (IL-<br>
Ib),   and  tumor  necrosis  factor-a   (TNF-a)   1  on<br>
77, 2001).<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 37,  38) for Mem-030 was used in real time<br>
■ RT-PCR  analyses  to  amplify  cDNA  derived  from  a<br>
comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues. Mem-<br>
tab.9).<br>
Most  surprisingly,  when cancer derived tissues  and<br><br><br>
Due to bioinformatics and literature analysis, a homologous gene of Mein-030 might be also an attractive therapeutic target (SEQ ID NO:39) and encodes a 586 aa protein (SEQ ID NO:40) with a molecular weight of 66, 6<br>
kDA.<br>
Bioinformatic investigations showed that both proteins represent cell surface molecules. The previously unknown selective overexpression of this surface molecule makes it a target for therapeutic purposes and<br>
for developing diagnostic methods for the detection of tumor cells and therapeutic methods for the elimination of tumor cells.<br><br>
Example 10: Identification of Mem-055 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
(SEQ ID N0:42) with a molecular weight of 27,9 kDA. The protein encoded by this gene is a lysosomal thiol reductase that at low pH can reduce protein disulfide bonds. The enzyme is expressed constitutively in antigen-presenting cells and induced by gamma-interferon in other cell types. This enzyme has an important role in MHC class Il-restricted antigen processing (Arunachalam et al. Froc Natl Acad Sci U S A.   97 (2) :745-50, 2000) ,<br>
The localization of Mem-055 and the protein topology was predicted by analysis -of the putative signal sequences and transmembrane domains with bioinformatic tools (TMPRED, SOUSI). Mem-055 might have an extracellular C-terminus.<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO:43, 44) for Mem-055 was used in real time RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues, Mem-055 show an ubiquitous expression pattern (fig.l3A, tab.10) .<br>
Most surprisingly, when Mem-055 expression within cancer derived tissues was investigated, we found high and significant levels of overexpression in a number of<br>
tumor types (fig.13A, 13E), especially stomach cancers -<br><br><br><br>
Mem-055 is a target structure for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, because of the putative extracellular domain and the unexpected overexpression in different carcinoma types.<br>
Example 11: Identification of Mein-062 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
Mem-062 (SEQ ID NO:45) encodes a 271 aa protein (SEQ ID NO:46) with a molecular weight of 30,7 kDA. By a computer-based screening method Mem-0 62 could previously be identified and was described as testis, prostate and placenta specifically expressed (Bera et al., Biochem  Biophys  Res   Comman. 312 (4 ): 1209-15, 2003)<br>
According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO:47, 48) for Mem-062 was used in RT-PCR analyses. Mem-0 62 surprisingly showed a cancer-testis speciiiic expression pattern (fig.14A, tab.11 No expression was detected in any other normal organ tissue. Most surprisingly, when cancer derived tissues were investigated, we found significant levels of Mem-62 expression (fig.14B), especially in ovarian carcinomas-.<br><br><br>
Alternative splicing results in an alternative transcript (SEQ ID NO:49) and its corresponding translation product (SEQ ID NO:50).<br>
Example 12: Identification of Mein-068 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
Mem-068 (SEQ ID NO:61) is a newly identified cDNA clone.<br>
0 58 could be described as mulriple exon gene on chromosome 9 (SEQ ID NO:62). The deduced protein sequence (SEQ ID NO:63) has 751 aa and forms a protein with a molecular weight of 82,4 kDA.<br>
Accordinq to the invention, a gene-specific primer Dair for Mem-068 was used in RT-PCR analyses, Mem-068 show surprisingly  a  cancer-testis   specific  expression<br><br><br>
According to the transmembrane prediction programme TMpred Mem-0 68 might be expressed at the cell surface, which makes it an interesting target for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.<br>
Example 13: Identification of Mem-071 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
Mern-071 (SEQ ID NO:64) is a new cDNA clone, which is encoded in 2 exons on chromosome 1,<br>
According to the invention, a gene-speciiic primer pair for Mem-071 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor<br><br><br>
The unexpected high incidence of Mem-071 in renal cell carcinomas make this protein according to the invention a highly interesting diagnostic and therapeutic marker.<br>
Example 14:  Identification of Mem-072 as  therapeutic<br>
and diagnostic ca-ncer target<br>
Mem-072 (SEQ ID NO:65) is a newly identified gene, which is encoded in 3 exons on chromosome 16. According to the invention, a gene-specific primer pair for Mem-C72 was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived from a comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues. No expression within alla teate normal vissues could be found (fig.l7A, tab.14). When cancer derived tissues and cancer cell lines were investigated, we<br><br><br>
The selective and high expression of Merri-072 in lung tumors was not previously known and can be utilized according to the invention for molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR for detecting disseminating tumor cells in the serum and bone marrow and for detecting metastases in other tissues. This molecule can be further used as specific target for therapeutic approaches.<br>
EKample 15: Identification of Mein-106 as therapeutic and diagnostic cancer target<br>
