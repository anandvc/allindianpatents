				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]      This invention relates generally to forming semiconductor devices, and more specifically, to forming silicide layers of semiconductor devices.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]       The semiconductor industry continually shrinks device dimensions to create faster devices. One such feature that is decreased is the width of polysilicon lines, which form the gate electrode of transistors. Metal silicide, formed on narrow polysilicon lines, improves contact resistance between the polysilicon line and other subsequently formed conductive lines. The metal silicide is formed by depositing a metal layer on the narrow polysilicon line and annealing the metal layer so that it reacts with the polysilicon line and forms a metal silicide. However, when forming a metal silicide over a narrow polysilicon line, it is difficult to nucleate the metal silicide. Poor nucleation results in large variations of thickness and often in noncontinuous layers, which undesirably increase the line sheet resistance of the layer. Due to the increase in line sheet resistance, devices being formed fail and yield decreases. Therefore, a need exists to form metal silicide over narrow polysilicon lines without decreasing yield.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0003]      The present invention is illustrated by way of example and is not limited by the accompanying figures, in which like references indicate similar elements.<br>

[0009]      Skilled artisans appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help improve the understanding of the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
[0010]      In contrast to the prior art, metal silicide is not nucleated on a narrow polysilicon line. Instead, a thin metal silicide layer is nucleated on a wider polysilicon region that is later etched to form the narrow polysilicon region. In one embodiment, the wider polysilicon region is blanket polysilicon such that it is deposited over all exposed surfaces of the semiconductor substrate. In one embodiment, the wider polysilicon region is blanket polysilicon. The wider polysilicon allows for uniform nucleation. Because the metal silicide layer is thin it can be etched while patterning the underlying polysilicon to form narrow polysilicon lines. Subsequently, a thicker metal silicide is formed over the thin metal silicide layer. In one embodiment, the combined thickness of the thin metal silicide layer and the thicker metal silicide layer is approximately equal to the thickness of the metal silicide formed over the narrow polysilicon lines in the prior art. The resulting structure has a continuous and uniform metal silicide over narrow polysilicon regions, but yield is not sacrificed. A more detailed understanding can be gained from a detailed description of the figures.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 1 is a portion of a semiconductor device 10 having a semiconductor substrate 12, an insulating layer 14, a conductive layer 16, a first metal silicide layer 18 and an antireflective layer 19. The semiconductor substrate 10 is provided 52 as shown in FIG. 5 and can be any semiconductor material or combinations of materials, such as gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon, monocrystalline silicon, the like, and combinations of the above. A portion of the insulating layer 14 will serve as a gate dielectric and hence can be any suitable insulating material such as silicon dioxide (SiO^) or a high-dielectric (hi-k) constant material (i.e., a material having a dielectric constant greater<br><br>
than silicon dioxide), such as hafnium oxide (HfC&gt;2) and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) or combinations of the above, such as silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. (As used in this<br>
*<br>
application, the word "layer" refers to one or more layers. For example, the insulating layer 14 may include a layer of silicon dioxide and a layer of hafnium oxide.) The insulating layer 14 can be thermally grown from a semiconductor substrate including silicon to form silicon dioxide or it may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition, (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), the like or combinations of the above.<br>
The conductive layer 16 is deposited 54 (see FIG. 5) over the semiconductor substrate 12 and may include silicon, (e.g., polysilicon, which may be doped), a metal, the like, or combinations of the above. For example, the conductive layer 16 may include titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN), or both. As will become apparent after further discussion if the overlying metal silicide layer is formed by depositing a metal and then performing an anneal then the conductive layer 16 should include silicon; however, if the metal silicide layer is to be deposited any material can be used. If an anneal is used, it is preferable that the conductive layer 16 has a top portion that includes silicon so that the silicon can react with a metal layer and form a metal silicide. It is not necessary that the top portion be the top most portion of the conductive layer; instead, the top portion must be sufficiently close to the subsequently formed metal layer to enable a reaction between the silicon in the top portion and the metal layer. If the conductive layer 16 is polysilicon, for example, it may be optionally doped 56 (see FIG. 5) using conventional processing to become more conductive (In addition, if the conductive layer 16 is doped the depletion effect in polysilicon may desirably be lowered. A portion of the conductive layer, which may be a gate electrode stack, will serve as a control or gate electrode of the semiconductor device 10 and hence, a skilled artisan can choose a thickness and material for this layer commensurate with its function as a gate electrode. For example, the conductive layer 16 may be approximately 100 nanometers of polysilicon. As will be explained in more detail below, in some embodiments, it may be desirable to make the conductive layer 16 thicker than desirable for the gate electrode because the thickness may decrease during processing.<br>
After forming the conductive layer 16, the metal silicide layer is formed either using a first process 58 or a second process 68, as shown in FIG. 5. In the first process 58, a first metal layer, such as cobalt, nickel or titanium, is deposited 60 on the conductive layer 16, in one embodiment, by sputtering (a form of PVD).   In one embodiment, the first metal layer is<br><br>
at least a monolayer in thickness but less then approximately 8 nanometers. Eight nanometers is preferred as the upper limit of the thickness because if the metal layer is thicker it may be difficult to etch the resulting metal silicide layer while etching the conductive layer 16. In one embodiment, the metal first layer has a thickness between approximately 2 to approximately 7 nanometers or more preferably approximately 3 nanometers or approximately 4 nanometers. Next, a first anneal is performed 62, at a first temperature, which in an embodiment where the first metal layer includes cobalt, is a rapid thermal anneal at approximately 450 degrees Celsius to form a first metal silicide. The first anneal forms an initial silicide phase (first metal silicide) over the conductive portions of the semiconductor device while avoiding such formation over the insulating regions, such as the field oxide and the spacer regions of the semiconductor device 10. After performing the first anneal, an optional wet etch may be used 63 to remove any unreacted metal that may be overlying the insulating regions.<br>
An optional nitrogen implant may be performed 64 after the first anneal and after the optional wet etch 63, if performed. The nitrogen implant helps prevent agglomeration of the first metal silicide layer during subsequent high temperature processing, thereby helping keep the first metal silicide layer uniform and continuous. In one embodiment, the nitrogen implant is performed as a straight implant (i.e., perpendicular to the semiconductor device 10) with a dosage between approximately 1E14 to approximately 5E15 atoms per centimeter squared, or more preferably approximately 1.5E15 atoms per centimeter squared, at an energy between approximately 0.7 KeV to approximately lOKeV, or more preferably approximately 1.5KeV. After the optional implant, a second anneal may be performed 66 at a second temperature, which in an embodiment where the first metal layer includes cobalt is a rapid thermal anneal at approximately 700 degrees Celsius to form a second metal silicide. The second metal silicide has a lower resistivity than the first metal silicide.   In one embodiment, the first temperature of the first anneal is less than the second temperature of the second anneal. The second anneal may not be performed if the first anneal is great enough to form a metal silicide layer with the desired low resistivity. During annealing, the metal layer reacts with silicon in the conductive layer 16 and forms a first metal silicide layer 18. Due to the reaction, the first metal silicide layer 18 should consume substantially the entire metal layer that was formed and some of the conductive layer 16. (Each angstrom of the metal layer will consume approximately 3.6 angstroms of a polysilicon conductive layer when the<br><br>
metal layer is cobalt.) In one embodiment, the first metal silicide layer will have a thickness of less than 25 nanometers after the second anneal.<br>
Alternatively, the process 68 can be performed. In this embodiment, a first metal silicide layer 18 is deposited, which can be performed by CVD, ALD, the like or combinations of the above. Preferably, the first metal silicide layer is less than 25 nanometers in thickness so that it is easily etched during the subsequent patterning process. Since in this embodiment the underlying conductive layer 16 is not consumed to form the first metal silicide layer 18, one advantage of using the process 68 is that a thinner conductive layer 16 can be formed than when using the process 58, where the consumption of the conductive layer 16 may be taken into account when forming the conductive layer 16. An optional nitrogen implant may be performed 69 after depositing 68 the first metal silicide layer over the conductive layer. The nitrogen implant helps prevent agglomeration of the metal silicide layer during subsequent high temperature processing steps thereby helping keep the metal silicide layer uniform and continuous. In one embodiment, the nitrogen implant is performed as a straight implant (i.e., perpendicular to the semiconductor device 10) with a dosage between approximately 1E14 to approximately 5E15 atoms per centimeter squared, or more preferably approximately 1.5E15 atoms per centimeter squared, at an energy between approximately 0.7 KeV to approximately lOKeV, or more preferably approximately l.SKeV.<br>
After forming the first metal silicide layer 18, an ARC (anti-reflective coating) layer 19 is optionally formed. In one embodiment, the ARC layer 19 includes two layers. The first layer may include a DARC (dielectric ARC). In one embodiment the DARC includes an oxide-based film, nitride-based film, the like, or combinations of the above, with a thickness between approximately 10 nanometers to approximately 100 nanometers. However, the film thickness may vary as it depends on optical properties and etch resistance of the material used. A thinner silicon-rich nitride film, which may be approximately 20 nanometers in thickness, may be used if overlying, subsequently formed, photoresist is used as a masking layer. If a non-photoresist hardmask is used instead of the photoresist, the thickness may be approximately greater than approximately 50 nanometers. The first layer may include a BARC (bottom ARC), which in one embodiment is a spin-on organic material, such as Clariant 1C IB with a thickness between approximately 10 nanometers to approximately 1000 nanometers. To provide the best combination of optical properties, the BARC thickness may<br><br>
be chosen to be the same thickness as the subsequently formed photoresist layer, such as Sumitomo 193nm-sensitive PAR-707. Under the first layer of the ARC layer 19, a second 'layer of the ARC layer 19 may include an OARC (organic ARC), such as the Applied Materials APF film with a thickness between approximately 10 nanometers to approximately 100 nanometers. Alternatively, the second layer may be a hardmask, such as silicon nitride, which may have a thickness greater than approximately 50 nanometers in thickness.. The ARC layer 19 may be deposited using CVD, PVD, ALD, spin-on, the like or combinations of the above. The ARC layer 19 is optionally used to help reduce reflection while patterning underlying layers. Alternate patterning methods may also be used, including bi-layer pattern systems.<br>
After forming the first metal silicide layer 18 and the ARC layer 19 if present, the first metal silicide layer 18, the ARC layer 19 (if present) and the conductive layer 16 are patterned 70, as illustrated in FIG. 2 to form the ARC 25 (if present), the first metal silicide layer 24 and the gate or control electrode 22. In one embodiment, a (positive or negative) photoresist layer 20 is formed and patterned over the semiconductor substrate 10 in order to form the ARC 25 (if present), the first metal silicide layer 24 and the gate or control electrode 22. In one embodiment, the first metal silicide layer 18 and the conductive layer 16 are etched using an etch chemistry for the conductive layer 16, such as fluorine-based chemistries like CF4 or SFe , chlorine based chemistries, such as C\i or ECU, or combinations of the above if the first metal silicide layer 18 is cobalt silicide and the conductive layer 16 is polysilicon. The insulating layer 14 may also be patterned at this time to form a gate insulating layer 21, but alternatively may not be patterned. After patterning, the photoresist layer 20 and the ARC 25, if present, are removed. In one embodiment, a combination of dry ash and wet etch processing is performed to remove the photoresist layer 20 and the ARC 25, if present.<br>
[0011]       After removing the photoresist layer 20 and the ARC 25, if present, a source extension 26 and a drain extension 28 may be formed by implanting at zero degrees relative to the normal to the surface of the semiconductor substrate 12 or at an angle. In one embodiment, the doping concentration may be between approximately 1E19 to 5E20 atoms per centimeters cubed of either an n-type (e.g., phosphorus) or p-type (e.g., boron) dopant.<br>
[0012]       After forming the source extension 26 and the drain extension 28, spacers 30 are formed along the sides of the control electrode 22, the first metal silicide 24 and the gate<br><br>
insulator 21 {if patterned, and if not patterned the spacers 30 are formed over the gate insulator 21). The spacers 30 may be formed by depositing an insulating layer, such as silicon nitride (Si^Ny), over the semiconductor device 10 and anisotropically etching the insulating layer using conventional chemistries. Other spacer implementations and structures, such as "L-shaped" spacers, may be used alone or in conjunction with the spacers 30 as illustrated.   After forming the spacers 30, deep source 31 and a deep drain 32 are' formed in the semiconductor substrate 12.<br>
[0013]      The deep source 31 and deep drain 32 may be formed using the spacers 30 and the first metal silicide layer 24 and control electrode 22 as a mask. The same dopants that were used to form the source extension 26 and the drain extension 28 may be used; however, the dopant concentration will be greater than that used to form the extensions 26 and 28. In one embodiment, the doping concentration may be between approximately 5E19 to 1E21 atoms per centimeters cubed of either an n-type (e.g., phosphorus) or p-type (e.g., boron) dopant. The source extension 26 and the deep source 31 form the source region (a current electrode) of the semiconductor device 10 and the drain extension 28 and the deep drain 32 form the drain region (a current electrode) of the semiconductor device 10, which are formed in process 72 in FIG. 5.<br>
[0014]       After forming the current electrodes, a second metal silicide layer 36 and 38 is formed over the first metal silicide and the current electrodes. The second metal silicide layer 36 may be formed by process 76 or process 74 in FIG. 5. For process 76, a second layer metal layer, such as cobalt, nickel or titanium, is deposited. In one embodiment, approximately 4 to 15 nanometers of metal is deposited by sputtering. After being deposited, the metal is annealed 80 at a first temperature and then annealed 82 at a second temperature which is greater than the first temperature. In between the first and second annealing processes 80 and 82, an optional etch process, such as a wet etch, may be performed 81 to remove any unreacted metal from the non-conductive portions of the device such as the field or the isolation oxide and from over the spacers 30. In one embodiment, the first temperature is approximately 450 degrees Celsius and the second temperature is approximately 700 degrees Celsius when using cobalt. During the first anneal, the second metal layer diffuses through the thin first metal silicide layer in the area over the gate electrode 22 and reacts with silicon in the gate electrode 22 so as to form a metal silicide. For example, it has been shown that cobalt will easily diffuse through approximately 7 nanometers of cobalt silicide to form<br><br>
a thicker cobalt silicide. The same process used to form the first metal silicide layer can be used. 'Since the first metal silicide layer is present, the nucleation of the second metal silicide layer is easy, and a uniform metal silicide over narrow polysilicon lines is formed. Alternatively, the second metal silicide layer can be formed by process 74 where the second metal silicide layer may be selectively deposited by CVD, ALD, the like or combinations of the above. The deposited second metal silicide layer is selective to the conductive regions. In one embodiment, the resulting second metal silicide layer 36 is approximately 15 nanometers to approximately 40 nanometers, or more preferably approximately 30 nanometers, in the area over the gate electrode 22. (This measurement includes the total thickness of all the metal silicide over the gate electrode 22.) In one embodiment, the resulting second metal silicide layer 38 and 39 is approximately 15 nanometers to approximately 40 nanometers, or more preferably approximately 20 nanometers, in the areas over the current electrodes, which are the active areas.  The second metal silicide layer 36,38, and 39 is thicker in the area over the control electrode 22 because in this region 36 the second metal silicide layer includes the first metal silicide layer. The second metal silicide layer 38 and 39 over the current electrodes is thinner than the second metal silicide layer 36 over the gate electrode 22 because the former does not merge with any underlying metal silicide layer. Like the first metal silicide layer, when the second metal silicide layer is formed by annealing and reacting with the underlying layer, the metal silicide layer will consume some of the silicon in the underlying layer, as illustrated in FIG. 4. In this embodiment, the underlying layer should include silicon, but it is not necessary if the metal silicide layer is deposited.<br>
[0015]       Titanium silicide, cobalt silicide and nickel silicide are desirable materials for both the first and second metal silicide layer because they have a thin film resistivity approximately in the range of 13-20 |i-ohm-cm.. The metals in these silicides can all be lower temperature refractory metal layers. (Titanium silicide can be viewed alternatively as an intermediate refractory metal, but for purposes herein will be a lower temperature refractory metal.)<br>
[0016]       By now it should be appreciated that there has been provided a method to form uniform metal silicide over thin areas, such as polysilicon lines or gate electrodes. The result is improved yield.<br><br>
[0017]      In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims below. For example, the first and the second silicidation anneal can be replaced by a single high temperature anneal to form the final low resistivity phase prior to a nitrogen implant. In addition, the source and drain regions can be reversed. For example, the drain extension 28 and the deep drain 32 may be the source extension 28 and the deep source 32.   Accordingly, the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0018]      Benefits, other advantages, and solutions to problems have been described above with regard to specific embodiments. However, the benefits, advantages, solutions to problems, and any element(s) that may cause any benefit, advantage, or solution to occur or become more pronounced are not to be construed as a critical, required, or essential feature or element of any or all the claims.
