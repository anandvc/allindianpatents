Background Art<br>
Auditory Events and Auditory Event Detection<br>
The division of sounds into units or segments perceived as separate and distinct is<br>
sometimes referred to as "auditor}' event analysis" or "auditory scene analysis" ("ASA").<br>
The segments are sometimes referred to as "auditory events" or "audio events." Albert S.<br>
Bregman, "Auditory Scene Analysis—The Perceptual Organization of Sound"<br>
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1991, Fourth printing, 2001, Second MIT Press<br>
paperback edition) extensively discusses auditory scene analysis. In addition,<br>
Bhadkamkar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,776 (Dec. 14, 1999) cites publications dating back<br>
to 1976 as "prior art work related to sound separation by auditory scene analysis."<br>
However, Bhadkanikaretal. discourages the practical use of auditory scene analysis,<br>
concluding that "[t]echniques involving auditory scene analysis, although interesting from<br>
a scientific point of view as models of human auditory processing, are currently far too<br>
computationally demanding and specialized to be considered practical techniques for<br>
sound separation until fundamental progress is made."<br>
Crockett and Crocket et a I. in the various patent applications and papers listed<br>
above identify auditory events. Those documents teach dividing an audio signal into<br>
auditory events (each tending to be perceived as separate and distinct) by detecting<br>
changes in spectral composition (amplitude as a function of frequency) with respect to<br>
time. This may be done, for example, by calculating the spectral content of successive<br>
time blocks of the audio signal, comparing the spectral content between successive time<br>
blocks and identifying an auditory event boundary as the boundary between blocks where<br>
the difference in the spectral content exceeds a threshold. Alternatively, changes in<br>
amplitude with respect to time may be calculated instead of or in addition to changes in<br>
spectral composition with respect to time.<br>
The auditory event boundary markers are often arranged into a temporal control<br>
signal whereby the range, typically zero to one, indicates the strength of the event<br>
boundary. Furthermore this control signal is often filtered such that event boundary<br>
strength remains, and time intervals between the events boundaries are calculated as<br>
decaying values of the preceding event boundary. This filtered auditory event strength is<br>
then used by other audio processing methods including automatic gain control and<br>
dynamic range control.<br>
Dynamics Processing of Audio<br>
The techniques of automatic gain control (AGO and dynamic range control<br>
(DRC) are well known and common in many audio signal paths. In an abstract sense,<br>
both techniques measure the level of an audio signal and then gain-modify the signal by<br>
an amount that is a function of the measured level. In a linear, 1:1 dynamics processing<br>
system, the input audio is not processed and the output audio signal ideally matches the<br>
input audio signal. Additionally, imagine an audio dynamics processing system that<br>
automatically measures the input signal and controls the output signal with that<br>
measurement. If the input signal rises in level by 6 dB and the processed output signal<br>
rises in level by only 3 dB, then the output signal has been compressed by a ratio of 2:1<br>
with respect to the input signal.<br>
In Crockett and Seefeldt, auditory scene analysis improves the performance of<br>
AGC and DRC methods by minimizing the change in gain between auditory event<br>
boundaries, and confining much of the gain change to the neighborhood of an event<br>
boundary. It does this by modifying the dynamics-processing release behavior. In this<br>
way, auditory events sound consistent and natural.<br>
Notes played on a piano are an example. With conventional AGC or DRC<br>
methods, the gain applied to the audio signal increases during the tail of each note,<br>
causing each note to swell unnaturally. With auditory scene analysis, the AGC or DRC<br>
gain is held constant within each note and changes only near the onset of each note where<br>
an auditory event boundary is detected. The resulting gain-adjusted audio signal sounds<br>
natural as the tail of each note dies away.<br>
Typical implementations of auditory scene analysis (as in the references above)<br>
are deliberately level invariant. That is, they detect auditory event boundaries regardless<br>
of absolute signal level. While level invariance is useful in many applications, some<br>
auditory scene analyses benefit from some level dependence.<br>
One such case is the method described in Crockett and Seefeldt. There, ASA<br>
control of AGC and DRC prevents large gain changes between auditory event boundaries.<br>
However, longer-term gain changes can still be undesirable on some types of audio<br>
signals. When an audio signal goes from a louder to a quieter section, the AGC or DRC<br>
gain, constrained to change only near event boundaries, may allow the level of the<br>
processing audio signal to rise undesirably and unnaturally during the quiet section. This<br>
situation occurs frequently in films where sporadic dialog alternates with quiet<br>
background sounds. Because the quiet background audio signal also contains auditory<br>
events, the AGC or DRC gain is changed near those event boundaries, and the overall<br>
audio signal level rises.<br>
Simply weighting the importance of auditory events by a measure of the audio<br>
signal level, power or loudness is undesirable. In many situations the relationship<br>
between the signal measure and absolute reproduction level is not known. Ideally, a<br>
measure discriminating or detecting perceptually quieter audio signals independent of the<br>
absolute level of the audio signal would be useful.<br>
Here, "perceptually quieter" refers not to quieter on an objective loudness measure<br>
(as in Seefeldt et al. and Seefeldt) but rather quieter based on the expected loudness of the<br>
content. For example, human experience indicates that a whisper is a quiet sound. If a<br>
dynamics processing system measures this to be quiet and consequently increases the<br>
AGC gain to achieve some nominal oulput loudness or level, the resulting gain-adjusted<br>
whisper would be louder than experience says it should be.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Herein are taught methods and apparatus for controlling the loudness of auditory<br>
events in an audio signal. In an embodiment, the method includes weighting the auditory<br>
events (an auditory event having a spectrum and a loudness), using skewness in the<br>
spectra and controlling loudness of the auditory events, using the weights. Various<br>
embodiments of the invention are as follows: The weighting being proportionate to the<br>
measure of skewness in the spectra; the measure of skewness is a measure of smoothed<br>
skewness; the weighting is insensitive to amplitude of the audio signal; the weighting is<br>
insensitive to power; the weighting is insensitive to loudness; any relationship between<br>
signal measure and absolute reproduction level is not known at the time of weighting; the<br>
weighting includes weighting auditory-event-boundary importance, using skewness in the<br>
spectra; and reducing swelling of AGC or DRC processing level during perceptibly<br>
quieter segments of the audio signal as compared to methods not performing the claimed<br>
weighting.<br>
In other embodiments, the invention is a computer-readable memory containing a<br>
computer program for performing any one of the above methods.<br>
In still other embodiments, the invention is a computer system including a CPU,<br>
one of the above-mentioned memories and a bus communicatively coupling the CPU and<br>
the memory.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention is an audio-signal processor including a<br>
spectral-skewness calculator for calculating the spectral skewness in an audio signal, an<br>
auditory-events identifier for identifying and weighting auditory events in the audio<br>
signal, using the calculated spectral skewness, a parameters modifier for modifying<br>
parameters for controlling the loudness of auditory events in the audio signal and a<br>
controller for controlling the loudness of auditory events in the audio signal.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention is a method for controlling the loudness<br>
of auditory events in an audio signal, including calculating measures of skewness of<br>
spectra of successive auditory events of an audio signal, generating weights for the<br>
auditory events based on the measures of skewness, deriving a control signal from the<br>
weights and controlling the loudness of the auditory events using the control signal.<br>

be better understood by referring to the following discussion and the accompanying<br>
drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like elements.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
FIG. I illustrates a device I for analyzing auditory scenes and controlling<br>
dynamics-gain parameters according to Crockett and Seefeldt. The device includes an<br>
auditory-events identifier 10, an optional auditory-events-characteristics identifier 11 and<br>
a dynamics-parameters modifier 12. The auditory events identifier 10 receives audio as<br>
input and produces an input for the dynamics-parameters modifier 12 (and an input for<br>
the auditory-events-characteristics identifier 11, if present). The dynamics-parameters<br>
modifier 12 receives output of the auditory-events identifier 10 (and auditory-events-<br>
characteristics identifier 11, if present) and produces an output.<br>
The auditory-events identifier 10 analyzes the spectrum and from the results<br>
identifies the location of perceptible audio events that are to control the dynamics-gain<br>
parameters. Alternatively, the auditory-events identifier 10 transforms the audio into a<br>
perceptual-loudness domain (that may provide more psychoacoustically relevant<br>
information than the first method) and in the perceptual-loudness domain identifies the<br>
location of auditory events that are to control the dynamics-gain parameters. (In this<br>
alternative, the audio processing is aware of absolute acoustic-reproduction levels.)<br>
The dynamics-parameters modifier 12 modifies the dynamics parameters based on<br>
the output of the auditory-events identifier 10 (and auditory-events-characteristics<br>
identifier 11, if present).<br>
In both alternatives, a digital audio signal .v[«] is segmented into blocks, and for<br>
each block t, D[t] represents the spectral difference between the current block and the<br>
previous block.<br>
For the first alternative, D[i] is the sum, across all spectral coefficients, of the<br>
magnitude of the difference between normalized log spectral coefficients (in dB) for the<br>
current block / and the previous block / -1 . In this alternative D[i] is proportional to<br>
absolute differences in spectra (itself in dB). For the second alternative, D[t] is the sum,<br>
across all specific-loudness coefficients, of the magnitude of the difference between<br>
normalized specific-loudness coefficients for the current block / and the previous block<br>
/ -1. In this alternative, D[t] is proportional to absolute differences in specific loudness<br>
(in sone).<br>
In both alternatives, if D[t] exceeds a threshold Dmin , then an event is considered<br>
to have occurred. The event may have a strength, between zero and one, based on the<br>
ratio of D[t] minus Dmm to the difference between Dnux and Dmm . The strength A[t]<br>
may be computed as:<br><br>
The maximum and minimum limits are different for each alternative, due to their<br>
different units. The result, however, from both is an event strength in the range 0 to I.<br>
Other alternatives may calculate an event strength, but the alternative expressed in<br>
equation (1) has proved itself in a number of areas, including controlling dynamics<br>
processing. Assigning a strength (proportional to the amount of spectral change<br>
associated with that event) to the auditory event allows greater control over the dynamics<br>
processing, compared to a binary event decision. Larger gain changes are acceptable<br>
during stronger events, and the signal in equation (I) allows such variable control.<br>
The signal A[t] is an impulsive signal with an impulse occurring at the location of<br>
an event boundary. For the purposes of controlling the release time, one may further<br>
smooth the signal A[t] so that it decays smoothly to zero after the detection of an event<br>
boundary. The smoothed event control signal A[t] may be computed from A[t]<br>
according to:<br><br>
Here aevent controls the decay time of the event control signal.<br>
FIG. 3 is a sequence of graphs illustrating the operation and effect of the<br>
invention, according to one embodiment, "b)" in FIG. 3 depicts the event control signal<br>
A[t] for the corresponding audio signal of "a)" in FIG. 3, with the half-decay time of the<br>
smoother set to 250 ms. The audio signal contains three bursts of dialog, interspersed with<br>
quiet background campfire crackling sounds. The event control signal shows many<br>
auditory events in both the dialog and the background sounds.<br>
In FIG. 3, "c)" shows the DRC gain signal where the event control signal A[t] is<br>
used to vary the release time constant for the DRC gain smoothing. As Crocket and<br>
Seefeldt describes, when the control signal is equal to one, the release smoothing<br>
coefficient is unaffected, and the smoothed gain changes according to the value of the<br>
time constant. When the control signal is equal to zero, the smoothed gain is prevented<br>
from changing. When the control signal is between zero and one, the smoothed gain is<br>
allowed to change — but at a reduced rate in proportion to the control signal.<br>
In "c" of FIG. 3, the DRC gain rises during the quiet background sounds due to<br>
the number of events detected in the background. The resulting DRC-modified audio<br>
signal in "'d)" of FIG. 3 has audible and undesirable swelling of the background noise<br>
between the bursts of dialog.<br>
To reduce the gain change during quiet background sounds, an embodiment of the<br>
invention modifies or weights the auditory strength A[i] using a measure of the<br>
asymmetry of the audio signal spectrum. An embodiment of the invention calculates the<br>
spectral skewness of the excitation of the audio signal.<br>
Skewness is a statistical measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. A<br>
distribution symmetrical about the mean has zero skew. A distribution with its bulk or<br>
mass concentrated above the mean and with a long tail tending lower than the mean has a<br>
negative skew. A distribution concentrated below the mean and with a long tail tending<br>
higher than the mean has a positive skew. The magnitude or power spectrum of a typical<br>
audio signal has positive skew. That is, the bulk of the energy in the spectrum is<br>
concentrated lower in the spectrum, and the spectrum lias a long tail toward the upper part<br>
of the spectrum.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an audio processor 2 according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The audio processor 2 includes the dynamics-parameters modifier 12 and the<br>
optional auditory-events-characteristics identifier 11 of FIG. 1, as well as an auditory-<br>
events identifier 20 and a skewness calculator 21. The skewness calculator 21 and<br>
auditory-events identifier 20 both receive the audio signal 13, and the skewness calculator<br>
21 produces input for the auditory-events identifier 20. The auditory-events identifier 20,<br>
auditory-events-characteristics identifier 11 and dynamics-parameters modifier 12 are<br>
otherwise connected as are their counterparts in FIG. 1.<br>
In FIG. 2, the skewness calculator 21 calculates the skewness from a spectral<br>
representation of the audio signal 13, and the auditory-events identifier 20 calculates the<br>
auditory scene analysis from the same spectral representation. The audio signal 13 may<br>
be grouped into 50 percent overlapping blocks of Msamples, and the Discrete Fourier-<br>
Transform may be computed as follows:<br><br>
where M=2*N samples and x[n,t] denotes a block of samples.<br>
The block size for the transform is assumed to be the same as that for calculating<br>
the auditory event signal. This need not be the case, however. Where different block rates<br>
exist, signals on one block rate may be interpolated or rate converted onto the same<br>
timescale as signals on the other block rate.<br>
The excitation signal E[b.t] approximating the distribution of energy along the<br>
basilar membrane of the inner ear at critical band b during time block t is computed;<br><br>
where T[k] represents the frequency response of a filter simulating the transmission of<br>
audio through the outer and middle ear and Ch[k] represents the frequency response of<br>
the basilar membrane at a location corresponding to critical band b.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts the frequency response of a suitable transmission filter T[k]. FIG.<br>
5 depicts a suitable set of critical band filter responses, corresponding to Cb[k]. in which<br>
40 bands are spaced uniformly along the Moore and Glasberg Equivalent Rectangular<br>
Bandwidth (ERB) scale, for a sample rate of 48 kHz and transform size of A/= 2048. A<br>
rounded exponential function describes each filter shape, and 1 ERB separates the bands.<br>
If the auditory event boundaries are computed from the specific loudness<br>
spectrum, per Crocket and Seefeldt, then the excitation signal E[b,t] already exists as<br>
part of the specific-loudness calculation.<br>
Finally the spectral skewness is computed from the excitation signal E[b,t] as:<br><br>
where f.t is the arithmetic mean of the excitation:<br><br>
and s is the variance of the excitation signal:<br><br>
The skewness signal SK[t] of equation (5) fluctuates considerably and requires<br>
smoothing for it to avoid artifacts when modifying the event control signal and<br>
subsequent dynamics processing parameters. One embodiment uses a single pole<br>
smoother with a decay constant aSK having a half-decay time of approximately 6.5 ms:<br><br>
Limiting the skevvness to maximum and minimum SKmax and SKmin, respectively,<br>
may be useful. A constrained skewness 5A""[t] may be computed as:<br><br>
Low values (values close to 0.0) of the skewness signal 5A.'"[/] typically<br>
correspond to characteristically quieter signals, while high skewness values (values close<br>
to 1.0) typically correspond to characteristically louder signals. In FIG. 3, the "e)" graph<br>
shows the skewness signal that corresponds to the audio signal in "a)" of FIG. 3. The<br>
skevvness is high for the louder dialog bursts and low for the background sounds.<br>
The skevvness signal i&gt;7C"[/] passes to the auditory-events identifier 20 of FIG. 2<br>
that weights the spectral difference measure D[i) as:<br><br>
The skewness-modified auditory strength signal ASK[t] is computed in the same<br>
way as A[t] in equation (1):<br>
c<br><br>
The skewness-modified auditory strength signal ASK[t] is smoothed in the same<br>
way as A[(] in equation (2):<br><br>
In FIG. 3, "f)" depicts the skewness-modified event control signal ASk[t] for the<br>
corresponding audio signal in "a)" of FIG. 3. Fewer auditory events appear during the<br>
background sounds while events corresponding to the louder dialog remain.<br>
In FIG. 3, "g)" shows the skewness-modified event-controlled DRC signal. With<br>
fewer auditory events in the background sounds, the DRC gain stays relatively constant<br>
and moves only for the louder dialog sections, "h)" in FIG. 3 shows the resulting DRC-<br>
modified audio signal.<br>
The DRC-modified audio signal has none of the undesirable swelling in level<br>
during the background sounds.<br>
The skewness signal SK"[t] goes low sometimes for perceplually louder signals.<br>
For these loud signals, the value of spectral difference measure D[t] is large enough that<br>
even after weighting by the skewness signal SK"[i] in equation 8, the weighted spectral<br>
difference measure DSK[t] is typically still large enough to indicate an auditory event<br>
boundary. The event control signal A^ll] is not adversely affected.<br>
Claims<br>

7. The method of claim 1 wherein any relationship between signal measure and<br>
absolute reproduction level is not known at the time of weighting.<br>
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the weighting comprises<br>
weighting auditory-event-boundary importance, using skewness in the<br>
spectra.<br>
9. The method of claim I further comprising<br>
reducing swelling of AGC or DRC processing level during perceptibly<br>
quieter segments of the audio signal as compared to methods not performing the<br>
claimed weighting.<br>
10. A computer-readable memory containing a computer program for performing<br>
any one of the methods of claims 1 - 9 .<br>
11. A computer system comprising:<br>
a CPU;<br>
the memory of claim 10 ; and<br>
a bus communicatively coupling the CPU and the memory.<br>
12. A audio-signal processor comprising:<br>
a spectral-skewness calculator for calculating the spectral skewness in an<br>
audio signal;<br>
an auditory-events identifier for identifying and weighting auditory events<br>
in the audio signal, using the calculated spectral skewness;<br>
a parameters modifier for modifying parameters for controlling the<br>
loudness of auditory events in the audio signal; and<br>
a controller for controlling the loudness of auditory events in the audio<br>
signal.<br>
13. A method for controlling the loudness of auditory events in an audio signal,<br>
comprising:<br>
calculating measures of skewness of spectra of successive auditory events<br>
of an audio signal;<br>
generating weights for the auditory events based on the measures of<br>
skewness;<br>
deriving a control signal from the weights; and<br>
controlling the loudness of the auditory events using the control signal.<br><br>
A method for controlling the loudness of auditory events in an audio signal. In an embodiment, the method includes<br>
weighting the auditory events (an auditory event having a spectrum and a loudness), using skewness in the spectra and controlling<br>
loudness of the auditory events, using the weights. Various embodiments of the invention are as follows: The weighting being<br>
proportionate to the measure of skewness in the spectra; the measure of skewness is a measure of smoothed skewness; the weighting<br>
