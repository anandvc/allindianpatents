COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
                 "[l,2]-OXAZINE-3,5-DIONES"<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company of Alfred-Nobel-Str. 50, 40789 Monheim, Germany,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel [l,2]-oxazine-3,5-dione derivatives and their enols, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use as microbicides, pesticides and herbicides.<br>
4-Phenyl-substituted [l,2]-oxazine~3,5-diones were described as herbicides for the first time in WO 01/17972. Furthermore, 4-acyl-substituted [l,2]-oxazine-3,5-diones were described as pesticides and in particular as herbicides and growth regulators, for example in EP-A-39 48 89, WO 92/07837, US 5,728,831.<br>

Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures of<br>
20	varying composition which, if desired, can be separated in a customary manner. The<br>
present invention provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use, and also compositions comprising them. However, hereinbelow, for the sake of simplicity, only compounds of the formula (I) are referred to, although this is meant to be understood as including both the pure compounds and, if<br>
25	appropriate, mixtures with varying proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>
Depending on the position of the substituent G, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present in the two isomeric forms of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B)<br><br>
Le A 35 508-Foreign Countries<br>
5^<br><br>
which is meant to be indicated by the broken line in formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B) can be present either as mixtures or<br>
5	in the form of their pure isomers. Mixtures of the compounds of the formulae (I-A)<br>
and (I-B) can, if desired, be separated in a manner known per se by physical methods, for example by chromatographic methods.<br>
For the sake of improved clarity, hereinbelow only one of the possible isomers is<br>
10	shown in each case. This does not exclude the fact that the compounds may, if<br>
appropriate, be present in the form of the isomer mixtures or in the other respective isomeric form.<br><br>

All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally<br>
occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by<br>
5	conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and<br>
recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic<br>
plants and inclusive of the plant cultivaxs protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
breeders" rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of<br>
plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples<br>
10	which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies,<br>
fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
15	Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds,<br>
20	also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
25	impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br><br>

As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic<br>
5	plants  and plant  cultivars  obtained by  genetic  engineering,  if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
10	Particularly preferably, plants  of the plant cultivars which are in each case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with novel properties ("traits") which are grown by conventional cultivation, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These may be cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
15<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
20	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
25	better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible<br>
which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,<br>
30	in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br><br>
Le A 35 508-Foreign Countries<br>
are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
5	processability  of the harvested products.  Further and particularly emphasized<br>
examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
10	important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and<br>
15	snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the<br>
genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants")- Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of plants to fungi,<br>
20	bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins,<br>
elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The<br>
25	genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination<br>
with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example<br>
30	maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also have very good fortifying action in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
5	In the present context, plant-fortifying (resistance-inducing) substances are to be<br>
understood as meaning those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, they show substantial resistance against these microorganisms.<br>
10<br>
In the present case, undesirable microorganisms are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Accordingly, the substances according to the invention can be used to protect plants for a certain period after the treatment against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period for which protection is<br>
15	provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the<br>
treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of<br>
20	plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants. 25<br>
At certain concentrations and application rates, the active compounds according to the invention can also be used as herbicides, for influencing plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br><br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have<br>
5	very  good antimycotic activity.  They have a very broad antimycotic activity<br>
spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, 10<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
15	forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a<br>
customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting,<br>
dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active<br>
compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound<br>
20	preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the<br>
seeds of the plants.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
25	of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application<br>
rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates<br>
30	are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br><br>
