				<td>BELT TYPE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION, STRADDLE TYPE<br>
VEHICLE, AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A SHEAVE OF THE BELT TYPE<br>
CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission, a straddle type vehicle provided with<br>
the belt type continuously variable transmission, and a method<br>
of manufacturing a sheave of the belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, there is known a straddle type vehicle<br>
provided with a belt type continuously variable transmission.<br>
A belt type continuously variable transmission comprises a<br>
primary sheave, to which a driving force from an engine is<br>
transmitted, and a secondary sheave, to which a driving force<br>
is transmitted through a V-belt from the primary sheave. In<br>
the belt type continuously variable transmission, a ratio of<br>
a diameter, at which a belt is wound round the primary sheave,<br>
and a diameter, at which the belt is wound round the secondary<br>
sheave, is varied whereby a reduction ratio is varied.<br>
Belt type continuously variable transmissions are<br>
usually used in that environment (referred below to as dry<br>
environment) , in which oil, moisture content, etc. do not enter.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
Here, in order to favorably transmit a driving force, a<br>
frictional force of a certain measure is needed between a sheave<br>
and a V-belt. On the other hand, however, when a V-belt is<br>
observed locally, states of contact/non-contact are switched<br>
over between a V-belt and a sheave as the V-belt runs, so that<br>
a lubricating ability of a certain measure is needed between<br>
the sheave and the V-belt. This is because with no lubricating<br>
ability, heat is generated due to friction between the V-belt<br>
and the sheave.<br>
Here, it is thought that a lubricating ability between<br>
a sheave and a V-belt is preserved mainly by powder (abrasion<br>
powder) generated from the V-belt. That is, abrasion powder<br>
generated by contact with a sheave is held on a sheave surface<br>
(portion of the sheave in contact with the V-belt) whereby the<br>
sheave and the V-belt slide relative to each other while<br>
maintaining a frictional force of a certain measure. When a<br>
sheave surface is smooth, however, the abrasion powder cannot<br>
be suitably held on the sheave surface. If so, it becomes<br>
difficult to preserve a lubricating ability favorably between<br>
the sheave and the V-belt. Accordingly, irregularities are<br>
needed on the sheave surface to hold the abrasion powder.<br>
On the other hand, when irregularities are present on<br>
a sheave surface, the irregularities make a V-belt liable to<br>
abrade. Therefore, when irregularities are made excessively<br>
large in magnitude, a V-belt becomes short in service life.<br>
2<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, magnitudes of irregularities on a sheave surface<br>
are preferably limited in a predetermined range.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 3609754 provides a description to<br>
the effect that in a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission provided with a V-belt, that portion of which is<br>
in contact with a sheave surface, being formed from a resin,<br>
an abrasion loss of the V-belt is reduced by making surface<br>
roughness of the sheave surface Ra 0.5 to 3.0 mm.<br>
However, it has been found as results of research made<br>
by the inventors of the present application that even when<br>
surface roughness of a sheave surface is in the predetermined<br>
range (Ra 0.5 to 3.0 mm) described above, an abrasion loss of<br>
a V-belt cannot necessarily be reduced. That is, it has been<br>
found that even when surface roughness of a sheave surface is<br>
in the predetermined range, a certain V-belt is small in<br>
abrasion loss and another V-belt is large in abrasion loss.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been thought of in view of the matter<br>
and has its object to give a preferred index for reduction in<br>
abrasion loss of a V-belt in a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission provided with a V-belt, that portion of which is<br>
in contact with a sheave surface, being formed from a resin,<br>
thus achieving making the belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission long in service life.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
The inventors of the present application have made<br>
researches earnestly in order to attain the object described<br>
above and thought that attention should be paid to the<br>
relationship between groove pitch and surface hardness of a<br>
sheave surface to reduce an abrasion loss of a V-belt.<br>
That is, as schematically shown in Fig. 1, in the case<br>
where a plurality of grooves 3 (In addition, "a plurality of<br>
grooves" referred to in the specification of the present<br>
application only means that a plurality of grooves are formed<br>
taking a cross section in a radial direction of a sheave into<br>
consideration, and includes the case where like, for example,<br>
a spiral groove, a plurality of grooves are continuous mutually<br>
to form a single groove as a whole. ) aligned at a predetermined<br>
pitch P in a radial direction are formed on a sheave surface<br>
1, dimensions of the grooves 3 are defined by depth D and pitch<br>
P. However, a parameter being surface roughness is dependent<br>
only on a depth D of the grooves 3 but irrelevant to pitch P.<br>
Therefore, it is thought that surface roughness alone cannot<br>
adequately define a magnitude of irregularities of the sheave<br>
surface 1.<br>
In examining abrasion of a V-belt, pressure (referred<br>
below to as contact pressure) acted on the V-belt from a sheave<br>
surface is important. The larger contact pressure, the more<br>
liable to abrade a V-belt. Here, in the case where grooves<br>
3 are formed on a sheave surface 1 (see Fig. 1) , contact pressure<br>
4<br>
 <br>
is varied according to a pitch P of the grooves 3. That is,<br>
when the pitch P of the grooves 3 is small, a contact area between<br>
the sheave surface 1 and the V-belt 2 becomes large, so that<br>
contact pressure becomes relatively small. Conversely, when<br>
the pitch P of the grooves 3 is large, a contact area between<br>
the sheave surface 1 and the V-belt 2 becomes small, so that<br>
contact pressure becomes relatively large. In this manner,<br>
it is thought that contact pressure is seriously influenced<br>
by the pitch P of the grooves 3 rather than a depth D of the<br>
grooves 3 (influences of surface roughness).<br>
From this viewpoint, the inventors of the present<br>
application have examined the relationship between groove<br>
pitch and surface hardness of a sheave surface and thought of<br>
the following invention.<br>
A belt type continuously variable transmission according<br>
to the invention comprises a primary sheave, a secondary sheave,<br>
and a V-belt wound round the primary sheave and the secondary<br>
sheave, at least a part of a contact portion thereof in contact<br>
with the primary sheave and the secondary sheave being formed<br>
from a resin, a plurality of grooves aligned in a radial<br>
direction of the sheaves as viewed in a cross section along<br>
the radial direction are formed on a sheave surface of at least<br>
one of the primary sheave and the secondary sheave, and the<br>
equation P ≤ -0.08Kxl0-3 + 0.18 is met where P(mm) indicates<br>
an average pitch of the grooves and K(Hv) indicates surface<br>
5<br>
 <br>
hardness of the sheave surface.<br>
A method of manufacturing a sheave of a belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission according to the invention<br>
is one, which comprises a primary sheave, a secondary sheave,<br>
and a V-belt wound round the primary sheave and the secondary<br>
sheave, at least a part of a contact portion thereof in contact<br>
with the primary sheave and the secondary sheave being formed<br>
from a resin, the sheave being the primary sheave or the<br>
secondary sheave, the method comprising the steps of forming<br>
a plurality of grooves aligned on a sheave surface in a radial<br>
direction of the sheaves as viewed in a cross section along<br>
the radial direction, the grooves meeting the equation P<br>
≤ -0.08K x l0-3 + 0.18 where P (mm) indicates an average pitch of<br>
the grooves and K(Hv) indicates surface hardness of the sheave<br>
surface, and applying plating to that sheave surface, on which<br>
the grooves are formed.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible in a belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission provided with a V-belt,<br>
that portion of which is in contact with a sheave surface, being<br>
formed from a resin to reduce abrasion loss of the V-belt, thus<br>
achieving making the belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission long in service life.<br>

 <br>
invention has been thought of.<br>
As described above, the inventors of the present<br>
application have thought that two parameters, that is, groove<br>
pitch and surface hardness of a sheave surface are important<br>
to abrasion of a V-belt in a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission (referred below to as CVT). Here, as a groove<br>
pitch increases, contact pressure increases and a V-belt<br>
becomes liable to abrade while as a groove pitch decreases,<br>
contact pressure decreases and a V-belt becomes hard to abrade.<br>
On the other hand, while surface hardness of a sheave surface<br>
increases, a V-belt becomes liable to abrade while as surface<br>
hardness decreases, a V-belt becomes hard to abrade. Hereupon,<br>
the inventors of the present application have thought that a<br>
characteristic representative of that degree, to which a V-belt<br>
is susceptible of abrasion, can be approximately represented<br>
by a rightward lowering, straight line in a graph, in which<br>
groove pitch is indicated on an axis of abscissa and surface<br>
hardness is indicated on an axis of ordinates (see Fig. 4).<br>
That is, it is thought that when being present on the straight<br>
line, a V-belt is substantially constant in an abraded state.<br>
The inventors of the present application have performed<br>
tests to examine a state of abrasion of a V-belt in CVT. Figs.<br>
2(a) and 2(b) show data of specimens used in the tests. Fig.<br>
3 is a graph illustrating results of the tests and showing a<br>
belt abrasion loss (strictly, abrasion loss in a width<br>
9<br>
 <br>
direction (left and right direction in Fig. 16) of a V-belt)<br>
versus travel distance.<br>
By the way, it is usually thought in motorcycles that<br>
there is caused no practical problem provided that a belt<br>
abrasion loss is 2 mm or less at a point of time when travel<br>
distance is 20000 km. In addition, when a V-belt abrades, CVT<br>
generates an error in speed change ratio but such error can<br>
be absorbed by making use of a known speed change ratio<br>
correction technique (see, for example, pamphlets of<br>
International Publication WO2004/044457A1, International<br>
Publication WO2005/090828A1, International Publication<br>
WO2006/009014A1, etc. In addition, the techniques disclosed<br>
in these pamphlets are included in the embodiment) even when<br>
a belt abrasion loss is 2 mm or so.<br>
Hereupon, in the case where a belt abrasion loss is 2<br>
mm or less when travel distance is 20000 km, it is determined<br>
that a state of a V-belt is favorable. Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)<br>
show results of determination. "GOOD" in a column of "ABRADED<br>
STATE" in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) indicates that a belt abrasion<br>
loss is 2 mm or less and a state of a V-belt is favorable, and<br>
"NO GOOD" indicates that a belt abrasion loss exceeds 2 mm and<br>
a state of a V-belt is not favorable. In addition, tests on<br>
some specimens were terminated at a point of time when travel<br>
distance was short of 20000 km. A two-dot chain line in Fig.<br>
3  is  a  characteristic  curve  predicted  from previous<br>
10<br>
 <br>
characteristics.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph, in which the relationship between<br>
groove pitch and surface hardness for Specimens Nos. 1 to 5<br>
are plotted. As described above, that degree, to which a V-belt<br>
is susceptible of abrasion, can be approximately represented<br>
by a rightward lowering, straight line. As the result of the<br>
tests, Specimen No. 1 was favorable in belt state. Accordingly,<br>
at least a rightward lowering, straight line passing through<br>
a point of Specimen No. 1 can be drawn as a boundary line, on<br>
which abrasion of a V-belt is permissible.<br>
Here, inclination of the straight line is problematic.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, however, Specimens Nos. 2 and 3 are<br>
favorable in belt state and besides Specimens Nos. 2 and 3 are<br>
more favorable in belt state than Specimen No. 1. In Fig. 4,<br>
since it is thought that as it goes leftwardly of the straight<br>
line, a belt state becomes favorable, it is expected that the<br>
boundary line passing through the point of Specimen No. 1 passes<br>
on the right of respective points of Specimens Nos. 2 and 3.<br>
Therefore, it is estimated that in the case where a straight<br>
line SI passing through respective points of Specimens Nos.<br>
1	and 3 is tentatively drawn, a belt state is favorable in at<br>
least a region below the straight line SI.<br>
Subsequently, Specimens Nos. 1, 4, and 5, which are equal<br>
to one another in surface hardness, will be examined (see Fig.<br>
2	(b) ) . As seen from Fig. 3, a belt state worsens in the order<br>
11<br>
 <br>
of Specimens Nos. 1, 4, and 5 but belt state in Specimens Nos.<br>
1 and 4 are in a favorable range. Therefore, it can be thought<br>
in Fig. 4 that the straight line SI is shifted rightward and<br>
it is thought that a boundary line, on which abrasion of a V-belt<br>
is permissible, passes between points of Specimens Nos. 4 and<br>
5 (see an imaginary line in Fig. 4) . Accordingly, in the case<br>
where a straight line S2 in parallel to the straight line SI<br>
and passing through a point of Specimen No. 4 is drawn, it is<br>
estimated that a belt state is favorable in at least a region<br>
below the straight line S2.<br>
The straight line S2 is represented by P = -0.08Kx10-3<br>
+0.18 where P(mm) indicates groove pitch and K(Hv) indicates<br>
surface hardness of a sheave surface. Therefore, according<br>
to the embodiment of the invention, CVT is designed so as to<br>
meet the equation P ≤ -0.08Kx10-3 + 0.18.<br>
Also, as described above, it is thought that a<br>
lubricating ability between a sheave and a V-belt is preserved<br>
mainly by powder (abrasion powder) generated from a V-belt.<br>
From the viewpoint of favorably holding abrasion powder on a<br>
sheave surface, it is preferable to maintain a groove depth<br>
and a groove pitch on a sheave surface in a predetermined range.<br>
Here, an arithmetical mean roughness Ra and a ten-point mean<br>
roughness Rz are known as a physical quantity representative<br>
of a groove depth.<br>
In case of using the arithmetical mean roughness Ra, even<br>
12<br>
 <br>
when irregularities being large in magnitude are present<br>
locally, whole measured values are less influenced by the<br>
irregularities, so that it is possible to obtain stable results<br>
as a whole. In the case where excessive irregularities are<br>
present here and there on a sheave surface, however, the<br>
irregularities promote abrasion of a V-belt and influences<br>
thereof become relatively large. Therefore, with the<br>
arithmetical mean roughness Ra, it is difficult to correctly<br>
evaluate such influences. On the other hand, in case of using<br>
the ten-point mean roughness Rz, when irregularities being<br>
large in magnitude are present locally, influences thereof are<br>
taken into consideration to some extent. Therefore, in taking<br>
account of abrasion of a V-belt, evaluation adapted to actual<br>
circumstances can be done by using the ten-point mean roughness<br>
Rz rather than the arithmetical mean roughness Ra.<br>
Hereupon, a ten-point mean roughness Rz of a sheave<br>
surface, on which the grooves are formed, is preferable to be,<br>
for example, 0.5 mm ≤ Rz ≤ 10 mm.<br>
The embodiment of the invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a straddle type vehicle according<br>
to the embodiment is a motorcycle 10. The motorcycle 10<br>
comprises a body frame 11, which constitutes a framework, and<br>
a seat 16, on which a rider is seated. The motorcycle 10<br>
comprises a so-called moped type motorcycle.  However, the<br>
13<br>
 <br>
straddle type vehicle according to the invention may comprise<br>
a motorcycle (for example, motorcycle type and scooter type<br>
motorcycles, etc.) other than a moped type motorcycle, or may<br>
comprise a straddle type vehicle (for example, ATV, etc.) other<br>
than a motorcycle.<br>
In the following descriptions, it is assumed that front<br>
and rear, and left and right directions are ones as seen from<br>
a crew seated on the seat 16. The body frame 11 comprises a<br>
steering head pipe 12, a single main frame 13 extending<br>
rearwardly and obliquely downwardly of the steering head pipe<br>
12, left and right seat rails 14L (see Fig. 6), 14R extending<br>
rearwardly and obliquely upwardly of an intermediate portion<br>
of the main frame 13, and left and right seat pillar tubes 15L,<br>
15R connected to a rear end of the main frame 13 and intermediate<br>
portions of the seat rails 14L, 14R.<br>
Upper and left and right sides of the body frame 11 are<br>
covered by a body cover 21. A space 17, which is dented<br>
downwardly and concave-shaped as viewed in side view, is<br>
compartmented upwardly of the body cover 21 and forwardly of<br>
the seat 16. Also, a center tunnel lla, which defines a passage<br>
for the main frame 13, is compartmented below the body cover<br>
21.<br>

A crank pin 59 is provided between a left crank arm 4 6a and<br>
a right crank arm 46b of the crank shaft 46. The other end<br>
of the connecting rod 51 is connected to the crank pin 59.<br>
Formed on the cylinder head 44 are a recess 44a, an intake<br>
port and an exhaust port, which are not shown but communicated<br>
to the recess 44a. An ignition plug 55 is inserted into the<br>
recess 44a of the cylinder head 44. As shown in Fig. 7, an<br>
intake pipe 52a is connected to the intake port and an exhaust<br>
pipe 52 is connected to the exhaust port. As shown in Figs.<br>
5 and 6, the exhaust pipe 52 is extended rearwardly rightward<br>
and obliquely downward from the cylinder head 44 and passes<br>
below the transmission casing 53 of the engine unit 28 to be<br>
extended further rearward to be connected to a muffler 54<br>
arranged on the right side of the rear wheel 26.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, formed on a left side in the cylinder<br>
43 is a cam chain chamber 56, which connects between an interior<br>
of the crank case 35 and an interior of the cylinder head 44.<br>
A timing chain 57 is arranged in the cam chain chamber 56. The<br>
timing chain 57 is wound around the crank shaft 4 6 and a cam<br>
shaft 58. The cam shaft 58 rotates upon rotation of the crank<br>
shaft 4 6 to open and close an intake valve and an exhaust valve,<br>
which are not shown.<br>
18<br>
 <br>
A generator casing 66 is detachably mounted to a left<br>
side of a front half of the first case block 35a to accommodate<br>
therein a generator 63. The transmission casing 53 is mounted<br>
to a right side of the second case block 35b to accommodate<br>
therein the CVT 30.<br>
An opening is formed on a right side of a rear half of<br>
the second case block 35b, the opening being closed by a clutch<br>
cover 60. The clutch cover 60 is detachably fixed to the second<br>
case block 35b by a bolt 61.<br>
The transmission casing 53 is formed independently of<br>
the crank case 35 and comprises an inner casing 53a, which<br>
covers an inside (left) of the CVT 30 in the vehicle width<br>
direction, and an outer casing 53b, which covers an outside<br>
(right) of the CVT 30 in the vehicle width direction. The inner<br>
casing 53a is mounted to a right side of the crank case 35 and<br>
the outer casing 53b is mounted to a right siide of the inner<br>
casing 53a. A belt chamber 67 is formed in the inner casing<br>
53a and the outer casing 53b to accommodate therein the CVT<br>
30.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, a right end of the crank shaft 4 6<br>
extends through the second case block 35b and the inner casing<br>
53a to be extended to the belt chamber 67. A primary sheave<br>
71 of the CVT 30 is fitted into the right end of the crank shaft<br>
46. Therefore, the primary sheave 71 rotates upon rotation<br>
of the crank shaft 46. A right portion (strictly, a portion<br>
19<br>
 <br>
on the right of the bearing 48) of the crank shaft 4 6 is formed<br>
with a primary sheave shaft 4 6c.<br>
On the other hand, a left end of the crank shaft 46 extends<br>
through the first case block 35a to be extended into the<br>
generator casing 66. The generator 63 is mounted to the left<br>
end of the crank shaft 46. The generator 63 comprises a stator<br>
64 and a rotor 65 opposed to the stator 64. The rotor 65 is<br>
fixed to a sleeve 74 that rotates with the crank shaft 46. The<br>
stator 64 is fixed to the generator casing 66.<br>
A secondary sheave shaft 62 is arranged in the rear half<br>
of the crank case 35 to be made in parallel to the crank shaft<br>
46. As shown in Fig. 11, a central portion of the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 62 is supported on the clutch cover 60 with a<br>
bearing 75 therebetween. Also, a left portion of the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 62 is supported on a left end of the second case<br>
block 35b with a bearing 76 therebetween.<br>
A right end of the secondary sheave shaft 62 extends<br>
through the second case block 35b and the clutch cover 60 to<br>
be extended to the belt chamber 67. A secondary sheave 72 of<br>
the CVT 30 is connected to the right end of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 62.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the CVT 30 comprises the primary<br>
sheave 71, the secondary sheave 72, and a V-belt 73 wound around<br>
the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72 . As described<br>
above, the primary sheave 71 is mounted to a right side of the<br>
20<br>
 <br>
crank shaft 46. The secondary sheave 72 is connected to a right<br>
side of the secondary sheave shaft 62.<br>
The primary sheave 71 comprises a stationary sheave half<br>
71a positioned outward in the vehicle width direction and a<br>
movable sheave half 71b positioned inward in the vehicle width<br>
direction and opposed to the stationary sheave half 71a. The<br>
stationary sheave half 71a is fixed to a right end of the primary<br>
sheave shaft 46c to rotate with the primary sheave shaft 46c.<br>
The movable sheave half 71b is arranged on the left of the<br>
stationary sheave half 71a and mounted slidably to the primary<br>
sheave shaft 4 6c. Accordingly, the movable sheave half 71b<br>
rotates with the primary sheave shaft 4 6c and is slidable<br>
axially of the primary sheave shaft 46c. A belt groove is<br>
formed between the stationary sheave half 71a and the movable<br>
sheave half 71b.<br>
A cooling fan 95 is provided on an outer side (right side<br>
in Fig. 10) of the stationary sheave half 71a. A cam surface<br>
111 is formed on a left portion of the movable sheave half 71b<br>
and a cam plate 112 is arranged on the left of the cam surface<br>
111. A roller weight 113 is arranged between the cam surface<br>
111 of the movable sheave half 71b and the cam plate 112.<br>
The secondary sheave 72 comprises a stationary sheave<br>
half 72a positioned inward in the vehicle width direction and<br>
a movable sheave half 72b positioned outward in the vehicle<br>
width direction and opposed to the stationary sheave half 72a.<br>
21<br>
 <br>
The movable sheave half 72b is mounted to the right end of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 62. The movable sheave half 72b rotates<br>
together with the secondary sheave shaft 62 and is slidable<br>
axially of the secondary sheave shaft 62. A compression spring<br>
114 isprovided on the right end of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
62 and the movable sheave half 72b is biased leftward by the<br>
compression spring 114. An axial portion of the stationary<br>
sheave half 72a is in the form of a cylindrical-shaped slide<br>
collar and spline-fitted onto the secondary sheave shaft 62.<br>
A reduction ratio in the CVT 30 is decided by the magnitude<br>
correlation between a force, with which the roller weight 113<br>
pushes the movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave 71<br>
rightward, and a force, with which the compression spring 114<br>
pushes the movable sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave 72<br>
leftward.<br>
That is, when the primary sheave shaft 4 6c is increased<br>
in rotational frequency, the roller weight 113 is exerted by<br>
a centrifugal force to move radially outward to push the movable<br>
sheave half 71b rightward. Then the movable sheave half 71b<br>
is moved rightward, so that the primary sheave 71 is increased<br>
in belt wound diameter. In keeping with this, the secondary<br>
sheave 72 is decreased in belt wound diameter, so that the<br>
movable sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave 72 is moved<br>
rightward against the bias of the compression spring 114.<br>
Consequently, the V-belt 73 on the primary sheave 71 is<br>
22<br>
 <br>
increased in wound diameter while the secondary sheave 72 is<br>
decreased in wound diameter, so that the reduction ratio<br>
decreases.<br>
On the other hand, when the primary sheave shaft 4 6c is<br>
decreased in rotational frequency, a centrifugal force on the<br>
roller weight 113 decreases, so that the roller weight 113 is<br>
moved radially inward along the cam surface 111 of the movable<br>
sheave half 71b and the cam plate 112. Therefore, a force,<br>
with which the roller weight 113 pushes the movable sheave half<br>
71b rightward, decreases. Then the bias of the compression<br>
spring 114 exceeds the force relatively, so that the movable<br>
sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave 72 is moved leftward<br>
and the movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave 71 is<br>
also moved leftward correspondingly. Consequently, the<br>
primary sheave 71 is decreased in belt wound diameter while<br>
the secondary sheave 72 is increased in belt wound diameter,<br>
so that the reduction ratio increases.<br>
Materials for the stationary sheave half 71a and the<br>
movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave 71, and materials<br>
for the stationary sheave half 72a and the movable sheave half<br>
72b of the secondary sheave 72 are not especially limitative.<br>
It is possible to preferably make use of metal such as aluminum,<br>
iron, stainless steel, etc. as materials for the members . Also,<br>
surfaces of the sheave half 71a, etc. may be of course subjected<br>
to surface treatment such as chrome plating, etc.<br>
23<br>
 <br>
According to the embodiment of the invention, the<br>
stationary sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b of<br>
the primary sheave 71 are formed from aluminum or an alloy<br>
partially containing aluminum. Hard chrome plating is applied<br>
to sheave surfaces (surfaces in contact with the V-belt 73)<br>
of the stationary sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half<br>
71b of the primary sheave 71. Consequently, the stationary<br>
sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b have a sheave<br>
surface hardness of about 1000 Hv.<br>
The stationary sheave half 72a and the movable sheave<br>
half 72b of the secondary sheave 72 are formed from stainless<br>
steel (SUS304). In addition, sheave surfaces of the<br>
stationary sheave half 72a and the movable sheave half 72b of.<br>
the secondary sheave 72 are not subjected to chrome plating.<br>
Consequently, the stationary sheave half 72a and the movable<br>
sheave half 72b have a sheave surface hardness of about 400<br>
Hv.<br>
In this manner, according to the embodiment, the<br>
secondary sheave 72 is lower in sheave surface hardness than<br>
the primary sheave 71. However, the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72 may be the same in sheave surface hardness.<br>
As shown in Figs. 12 and 13, according to the embodiment,<br>
spiral-shaped grooves 91 are formed on sheave surfaces (more<br>
specifically, surfaces of the stationary sheave half 71a, the<br>
movable sheave half 71b, the stationary sheave half 72a, and<br>
24<br>
 <br>
the movable sheave half 72b in contact with the V-belt 73) of<br>
the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), a<br>
plurality of grooves 91 aligned at predetermined pitch P in<br>
a diametrical direction are formed on sheave surfaces of the<br>
stationary sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b of<br>
the primary sheave 71 by means of turning process. Also, as<br>
shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), similar grooves 91 are formed<br>
on sheave surfaces of the stationary sheave half 72a and the<br>
movable sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave 72 by means<br>
of turning process.<br>
The grooves 91 according to the embodiment are formed<br>
to be spiral about an axis 92 of the sheave halves 71a, 71b,<br>
72a, 72b. As shown in Figs. 12 (b) and 13 (b), cross sections<br>
of the sheave halves 71a, 71b, 72a, 72b in a radial direction<br>
are formed by the grooves 91 to be concave and convex. As shown<br>
in Fig. 12 (b) , plating 93 is applied to sheave surfaces of the<br>
stationary sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b of<br>
the primary sheave 71. According to the embodiment, the<br>
plating comprises chrome plating. That is, chrome plated<br>
layer 93 are formed on the sheave surfaces of the stationary<br>
sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b. In this manner,<br>
according to the embodiment, in manufacture of the stationary<br>
sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b, the grooves<br>
91 are first formed on the sheave surfaces by means of turning<br>
25<br>
 <br>
process, and then plating is applied to the sheave surfaces.<br>
By the way, grinding as well as turning process is also<br>
conceivable as a way to form a plurality of grooves on a sheave<br>
surface. However, turning process is further preferable as<br>
a way to form the grooves 91.<br>
However, grooves on the sheave surfaces are not limited<br>
to the spiral grooves 91. As shown in, for example, Fig. 14,<br>
a plurality of concentric grooves 91a centered on an axis of<br>
the sheaves may be formed on the sheave surfaces. With a view<br>
to holding abrasion powder suitably, it is preferred that cross<br>
sections of the sheave halves 71a, 71b, 72a, 72b in a radial<br>
direction be formed to be concave and convex by the grooves<br>
on the sheave surfaces.<br>
Here, the pitch P(mm) is represented by P ≤ -0.08Kx10-3<br>
+ 0.18 where K(Hv) indicates surface hardness of a sheave<br>
surface.<br>
The pitch P and the surface hardness K may be P ≤ 0.1<br>
and K ≤ 1000.  In particular, 0.05 ≤ P ≤ 0.1 and 400 ≤ K ≤ 1000<br>
will do. Of course, the pitch P and the surface hardness K<br>
may be the same as those of Specimens Nos. 1 to 4 shown in Figs.<br>
2(a) and 2(b).<br>
Subsequently, an explanation will be given to a structure<br>
of the V-belt 73. As shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the V-belt 73<br>
comprises a plurality of resin blocks 73a arranged in one<br>
direction, and a pair of connecting bodies 73b connecting<br>
26<br>
 <br>
between the resin blocks 73a. As shown in Fig. 16, resin blocks<br>
73a are formed to be substantially trapezoid-shaped so as to<br>
follow both belt grooves of the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72. Recesses 73c dented inward are formed<br>
on both left and right sides of the resin blocks 73a.<br>
The connecting bodies 73b are formed to be endless. As<br>
shown in Fig. 15, the connecting bodies 73b are extended in<br>
a direction, in which the resin blocks 73a are aligned, and<br>
fitted into the recesses 73c of the respective resin blocks<br>
73a. In this manner, the connecting bodies 73b are fitted into<br>
the recesses 73c of the resin blocks 73a whereby the plurality<br>
of resin blocks 73a are connected together through the<br>
connecting bodies 73b. The connecting bodies 73b are formed<br>
from rubber. As shown in Fig. 16, a plurality of lengths of<br>
core wire 73d for reinforcement are embedded in the rubber.<br>
Left and right sides of the resin blocks 73a and the connecting<br>
bodies 73b of the V-belt 73 constitute contact surfaces in<br>
contact with sheave surfaces of the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72.<br>
In addition, with the V-belt according to the invention,<br>
at least a part of a contact portion thereof in contact with<br>
the sheave surfaces suffices to be formed from a resin, and<br>
the V-belt is not limited to the V-belt 73, in which the<br>
plurality of resin blocks 73a are connected by the connecting<br>
bodies 73b.<br>
27<br>
 <br>
As shown in Fig. 10, a sealing groove 68a is formed on<br>
a left side of a peripheral edge of the inner casing 53a and<br>
a right side of a peripheral edge of the second case block 35b<br>
is fitted into the sealing groove 68a. In addition, an O-ring<br>
68 is inserted between the inner casing 53a and the second case<br>
block 35b in the sealing groove 68a. Also, a sealing groove<br>
69a is formed on a right side of the peripheral edge of the<br>
inner casing 53a and a peripheral edge of the outer casing 53b<br>
is fitted into the sealing groove 69a. An O-ring 69 is inserted<br>
between the inner casing 53a and the outer casing 53b in the<br>
sealing groove 69a. The outer casing 53b and the second case<br>
block 35b are clamped by bolts 70 in a state, in which the inner<br>
casing 53a is interposed therebetween.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the centrifugal clutch 41 is mounted<br>
to a left portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62. The<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 comprises a wet multi-disc type clutch<br>
provided with a substantially cylindrical-shaped clutch<br>
housing 78 and a clutch boss 77. The clutch housing 78 is<br>
spline-fitted onto the secondary sheave shaft 62 to rotate<br>
integrally with the secondary sheave shaft 62. A plurality<br>
of ring-shaped clutch plates 79 are mounted to the clutch<br>
housing 78. The clutch plates 79 are aligned at intervals<br>
axially of the secondary sheave shaft 62.<br>
A cylindrical-shaped gear 80 is fitted rotatably around<br>
the left portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62 with two<br>
28<br>
 <br>
bearings 81a, 81b therebetween. The clutch boss 77 is arranged<br>
radially inwardly of the clutch plates 79 and radially<br>
outwardly of the gear 80 to mesh with the gear 80. Therefore,<br>
the gear 80 rotates together with the clutch boss 77. A<br>
plurality of ring shaped friction  plates 82 are mounted<br>
radially outwardly of the clutch boss 77. The friction plates<br>
82 are aligned at intervals axially of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 62, the respective friction plates 82 being arranged<br>
between adjacent clutch plates 79, 79.<br>
A plurality of cam surfaces 83a are formed on a left side<br>
of the clutch housing 78. Roller weights 84a are arranged<br>
between the cam surfaces 83a and the right-most clutch plate<br>
79 opposed to the cam surfaces 83a.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 41 is automatically switched<br>
between a clutch-in state (connected state) and a clutch-off<br>
state (disconnected state) according to the magnitude of a<br>
centrifugal force acting on the roller weights 84a.<br>
That is, when a rotational speed of the clutch housing<br>
78 becomes equal to or larger than a predetermined speed, the<br>
roller weights 84a are exerted by a centrifugal force to move<br>
radially outward, so that the clutch plates 79 are pushed<br>
leftward by the roller weights 84a. Consequently, the clutch<br>
plates 79 and the friction plates 82 are brought into pressure<br>
contact with each other to bring about the clutch-in state,<br>
in which a driving force of the secondary sheave shaft 62 is<br>
29<br>
 <br>
transmitted to an output shaft 85 through the gear 80 and the<br>
speed reducer 42.<br>
On the other hand, when a rotational speed of the clutch<br>
housing 78 becomes less than the predetermined speed, a<br>
centrifugalforce acting on the roller weights 84a decreases,<br>
so that the roller weights 84a move radially inward.<br>
Consequently, pressure contact between the clutch plates 79<br>
and the friction plates 82 is released, so that the clutch-off<br>
state, in which a driving force of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
62 is not transmitted to the output shaft 85 through the gear<br>
80 and the speed reducer 42, is brought about. In addition,<br>
in Fig. 11, a front portion (an upper side in Fig. 11) in the<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 represents the clutch-off state and a<br>
rear portion (a lower side in Fig. 11) represents the clutch-in<br>
state.<br>
The speed reducer 42 is interposed between the<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 and the output shaft 85. The speed<br>
reducer 42 includes a speed change shaft 100 arranged in<br>
parallel to the secondary sheave shaft 62 and the output shaft<br>
85. The speed change shaft 100 is supported rotatably on the<br>
first case block 35a with a bearing 101 therebetween and<br>
supported rotatably on the second case block 35b with a bearing<br>
102 therebetween. Provided on a right end of the speed change<br>
shaft 100 is a first speed change gear 103, which meshes with<br>
the gear 80.<br>
30<br>
 <br>
Provided centrally on the speed change shaft 100 is a<br>
second speed change gear 104, which is smaller in diameter than<br>
the first speed change gear 103. Formed on an outer peripheral<br>
side of a right end of the output shaft 85 is a third speed<br>
change gear 105, which meshes w±th the second speed change gear<br>
104.	The inner peripheral side of the right end of the output<br>
shaft 85 is supported on a left end of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 62 with a bearing 106 therebetween. Accordingly, the<br>
output shaft 85 is supported rotatably on the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 62 with the bearing 106 therebetween. Also, a central<br>
portion of the output shaft 85 is supported rotatably on the<br>
left end of the first case block 35a with a bearing 107<br>
therebetween.<br>
With such construction, the clutch boss 77 and the output<br>
shaft 85 are connected to each other through the gear 80, the<br>
first speed change gear 103, the speed change shaft 100, the<br>
second speed change gear 104, and the third speed change gear<br>
105.	Therefore, the output shaft 85 rotates upon rotation of<br>
the clutch boss 77.<br>
A left end of the output shaft 85 extends through the<br>
first case block 35a to project outside the crankcase 35. A<br>
drive sprocket 108 is fixed to the left end of the output shaft<br>
85. Wound around the drive sprocket 108 is a chain 109 that<br>
transmits a driving force of the output shaft 85 to the rear<br>
wheel 26.  In addition, a mechanism, which transmits a driving<br>
31<br>
 <br>
force of the output shaft 85 to the rear wheel 26, is not limited<br>
to the chain 109 but may comprise other members such as a<br>
transmission belt, a gear mechanism composed of a combination<br>
of a plurality of gears, a drive shaft, etc.<br>
As described above, with the CVT 30 according to the<br>
embodiment, the plurality of grooves 91 are formed on the sheave<br>
surfaces of the sheave halves 71a, 71b of the primary sheave<br>
71 and the sheave halves 72a, 72b of the secondary sheave 72<br>
to be aligned at predetermined pitch P(mm) in the radial<br>
direction and setting is made to meet P ≤ -0.08Kx10-3 +0.18<br>
where K(Hv) indicates surface hardness of the sheave halves<br>
71a, 71b, 72a, 72b. Thereby, it is possible to reduce a belt<br>
abrasion loss of the V-belt 73 while maintaining a lubricating<br>
ability between the respective sheaves 71, 72 and the V-belt<br>
73. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve making the CVT 30<br>
long in service life, thus enabling improving the CVT 30 in<br>
reliability.<br>
The V-belt 73 can be further reduced in belt abrasion<br>
loss by meeting P ≤ 0.1 and K ≤ 1000, so that it is possible<br>
to further achieve making the CVT 30 long in service life.<br>
Further, by meeting 0.05 ≤ P ≤ 0.1 and 400 ≤ K ≤ 1000<br>
and setting suitable lower limits for the groove pitch P and<br>
the surface hardness K, it is possible to make prevention of<br>
abrasion of the V-belt 73 and prevention of abrasion of the<br>
sheaves 71, 72 highly compatible with each other while<br>
32<br>
 <br>
maintaining a lubricating ability between the sheaves 71, 72<br>
and the V-belt 73. In addition, by suppressing abrasion of<br>
the sheaves 71, 72, the grooves 91 on the sheave surfaces are<br>
made hard to be susceptible to aged deterioration and it is<br>
possible to maintain the lubricating ability of the V-beit 73<br>
over a long term.<br>
Also, according to the embodiment, the grooves 91 are<br>
formed by subjecting the sheave surfaces of the respective<br>
sheaves 71, 72 to turning process. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to realize the grooves 91 simply and inexpensively.<br>
As shown in Figs. 17 (a) and 17 (b) , with the CVT 30<br>
according to the embodiment, a distance between the primary<br>
sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72 is short as compared with<br>
magnitudes of the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave<br>
72. Specifically, according to the embodiment, a distance L<br>
between an axis of the primary sheave 71 and an axis of the<br>
secondary sheave 72 is twice a diameter D2 of the secondary<br>
sheave 72 or less. Also, both the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72 are arranged between an axis of the front<br>
wheel 19 and an axis of the rear wheel 26 (see Fig. 5) .<br>
Therefore, according to the embodiment, a ratio of that portion<br>
of the V-belt 73, which contacts with the sheave surfaces of<br>
the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72, to a whole<br>
thereof is large. Accordingly, the CVT 30 is constructed such<br>
that the V-belt 73 is originally liable to abrade since the<br>
33<br>
 <br>
V-belt 73 frequently goes in and out of the sheave grooves.<br>
Since it is possible according to the embodiment to suppress<br>
abrasion of the V-belt 73, there is not caused a problem<br>
especially even when a distance between the primary sheave 71<br>
and the secondary sheave 72 is short.<br>
- Modification of groove configuration<br>
The groove pitch P according to the embodiment is uniform.<br>
However, grooves on a sheave surface according to the invention<br>
are not necessarily uniform.<br>
Grooves on a sheave surface according to the invention<br>
may be varied in groove pitch midway in a radial direction.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 18, groove pitch may change to<br>
W2 f rom Wl midway in a radial direction. Times, in which groove<br>
pitch changes in a radial direction, is not limited to one but<br>
may be twice or more. A manner, in which groove pitch changes,<br>
may be such that groove pitch decreases relatively outward from<br>
a center in a radial direction (see Fig. 18), or increases<br>
relatively. Also, after groove pitch decreases once as it goes<br>
in a radial direction, groove pitch may increase again, or vice<br>
versa.<br>
In addition, in the case where groove pitch is not uniform,<br>
the effect described above can be obtained provided that an<br>
average groove pitch P meets the equation, that is, P<br>
≤ -0.08Kx10-3 + 0.18. The average groove pitch can be defined<br>
by, for example, "radial length of that portion, on which<br>
34<br>
 <br>
grooves are formed,"/"number of grooves in a radial direction<br>
as viewed in a radial cross section".<br>
However, a maximum groove pitch among several groove<br>
pitches preferably meets the equation. For example, while two<br>
groove pitches W1, W2 are present in an example shown in Fig<br>
18, a maximum groove pitch Wl among them preferably meets the<br>
equation Wl ≤ -0.08Kx10-3 + 0.18.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 19, groove pitch may be changed<br>
alternately in a radial direction. Even in such case, the<br>
effect described above can be obtained provided that an average<br>
groove pitch meets the equation. In addition, in this example,<br>
a maximum groove pitch W3 among a plurality of groove pitches<br>
W3, W4 preferably meets the equation W3 ≤ -0.08Kxl0-3 + 0.18.<br>
Also, groove pitch may be changed randomly in a radial<br>
direction. Even in such case, the effect described above can<br>
be obtained provided that an average groove pitch meets the<br>
equation.<br>
In addition, groove pitch may be configured such that<br>
the embodiment and the modification are appropriately combined<br>
together. For example, groove pitch may be uniform in a<br>
predetermined range in a radial direction and groove pitch may<br>
be changed once or twice or more in other ranges . Alternatively,<br>
groove pitch may be uniform in a predetermined range in a radial<br>
direction and groove pitch may be changed alternately in other<br>
ranges. Also, groove pitch may be uniform in a predetermined<br>
35<br>
 <br>
range in a radial direction and groove pitch may be changed<br>
irregularly in other ranges. Groove pitch may be changed<br>
alternately in a predetermined range in a radial direction and<br>
groove pitch may be changed irregularly in other ranges. Also,<br>
groove pitch may be uniform in a predetermined range in a radial<br>
direction, groove pitch may be changed alternately in a further<br>
range, and groove pitch may be changed irregularly in a still<br>
further range.<br>
Also, while projections formed between grooves on a<br>
sheave surface project at acute angles in the embodiment and<br>
the modification, tip ends of the projections may be rounded.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 20, tip ends of projections 91b may be<br>
flat.  In the case where the tip ends of projections 91b are<br>
flat, groove pitch P makes a distance between a position Kl,<br>
in which one 91b of both adjacent projections 91b begins to<br>
descend, and a position K2, in which the other 91b begins to<br>
descend.  In addition, in the case where tip ends of projections<br>
are rounded, or in the case where tip ends of projections are<br>
flat, contact surface pressure on a V-belt is decreased as<br>
compared with the case where tip ends of projections are pointed,<br>
so that it is further preferable.<br>
As described above, "a plurality of grooves aligned in<br>
a radial direction" in the invention means that a plurality<br>
of grooves are aligned in a cross section along a radial<br>
direction, and does not prescribe that the number of grooves<br>
36<br>
 <br>
is plural when a sheave surface is viewed from the front. Also,<br>
as described above, grooves on a sheave surface is not limited<br>
to the spiral-shaped grooves 91 (see Fig. 12 (a)) but may<br>
comprise the concentric grooves 91a (see Fig. 14(a)). Also,<br>
spiral-shaped grooves do not necessarily comprise a single<br>
continuous groove as viewed in front view but may comprise a<br>
plurality (two in an example shown in Fig. 21) of spiral-shaped<br>
grooves as viewed in front view.<br>
Also, grooves aligned in a radial direction and formed<br>
discretely in a circumferential direction as shown in Fig. 22<br>
will do.<br>
As described above, the invention is useful in belt type<br>
continuously variable transmissions, straddle type vehicle<br>
