WO 2907/051184	- PCT/US2006/060330<br>
-TONE-AWAY PROTOCOLS FOR WIRELESS SYSTEMS—<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0001] The subject technology relates generally to communications systems and methods, and more particularly to systems and methods that provide protocols that enable communications transceivers to be tuned to an alternative channel in order to determine alternative frequencies or technologies that facilitate further communications in a mobile wireless communications setting.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0002] Wireless companies are constantly improving next-generation networks that combine voice and data on cellular networks, for example. Collectively, these companies have spent billions on licenses and equipment to provide a broad array of new data-centric services for customers. But emerging technologies could offer a leap past so-called third-generation systems just as they are beginning to emerge. One such technology is based on the IEEE 802.20 standard, a member of the 802 family that includes the better-known 802.1 lb, or Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi LAN (local area network) standard has proliferated in recent years by offering broadband wireless connections for laptops and other mobile devices.<br>
[0003] A new standard could change the direction of wireless networking, though. Whereas Wi-Fi and the newer 802.16 metro-area wireless broadband system are limited by the range of coverage areas ~ from a few hundred feet to 30 miles or so, respectively whereas 802.20 sits on existing cellular towers. It essentially promises the same coverage area as a mobile phone system with the speed of a Wi-Fi connection. This may account for why 802.20, or mobile broadband wireless access (MBWA), has generated interest regarding potential new applications.<br>
[0004] One differentiating factor for these new applications is that they provide full mobility and nationwide coverage through cell-to-cell handoff with access to broadband speeds for any application. Thus, business travelers, for example, can access corporate networks while on the move and send information in real-time back to the office — just as if they were connected to the local area network at their respective office.  In some<br><br><br>
■WO 2007/051184	PCT/US2006/060330<br><br>
cases, users get the same broadband Internet experience they have with a DSL or cable modem connection, but in a cellular mobile environment.<br>
[0005] One aspect for employing mobile broadband wireless access technologies is the concept of an active set and related protocol for managing communications between an access terminal such as a cell phone and an access network such as a base station. A default Active Set Management Protocol provides the procedures and messages used by the access terminal and the access point to keep track of the access terminal's approximate location and to maintain the radio link as the access terminal moves between coverage areas of different sectors. In general, the Active Set is defined as a set of Pilots or Sectors with allocated MACID for an access terminal. The Active Set members can be synchronous or asynchronous with respect to each other. The access terminal can generally switch its serving Sector at any time among these Active Set member Sectors.<br>
[0006] A Synchronous Subset of an Active Set consists of sectors that are synchronous with each other. Moreover, the subset is a maximal subset, i.e., generally all sectors that are synchronous with the sectors in this subset are contained in this subset. The different Synchronous Subsets ASSYNCH can be constructed using a last instance of an Active Set Assignment message, for example. Transmission from the access terminal to two different Synchronous Subsets of the active set is considered independent of each other. For example, the access terminal reports CQI to a Synchronous Subset of sectors independent of any other Synchronous Subset. One area that is of important concern is how communications are handed off between frequencies on a communications channel and/or between communications technologies that may be different between component of a given mobile broadband wireless access system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] The following presents a simplified summary of various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview. It is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.<br>
[0008] Systems and methods are provided that facilitate wireless communications between wireless devices, between stations for broadcasting or receiving wireless<br><br><br>
WO 2007/051184	  PCT/US2006/060330<br>
signals, and/or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, various protocols are provided that can be employed by components such as access terminals and access nodes to determine an optimum, channel for communications. The protocol enables signaling between access components that initiates automated procedures to determine if an alternative frequency and/or technology is available for use in wireless communications. The protocol may include employment of a tune-away attribute and a tune-away control message to control such aspects as tune-away duration times, tune-away periods, timing frame parameters, and whether or not to enable or disable a tune-away sequence. By employing such protocol, optimal communications channels can be selected as wireless devices are mobilized from one point to another. In one embodiment, a method is provided that includes a sector time offset to enable synchronization of tune away between nodes as an access terminal moves between different asynchronous sectors.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, inter-frequency and inter-radio access technology tune-away mechanisms are provided that facilitate communications in a mobile broadband wireless access system. These mechanisms are provided in a connected mode where there are on-going communications of a given channel. In general, in order to support such mobile communications applications without having to employ dual receivers for sampling and locating alternative communications paths, the tune away mechanism allows an access terminal to dynamically cooperate with an access network to determine potential communications paths to continue a particular session.<br>
[0010] As conditions change, the tune away mechanism allows the current communications channel to be tuned to a subsequent frequency in order to determine properties of an alternative communications path such as signal strength of the path. The tune away condition provides a temporary sampling of alternative paths while mitigating disruptions to current communications. Such sampling allows determining which potential frequencies may be employed for future communications as conditions change such as when a mobile device moves from one point to another. In another embodiment, tune away may be employed to facilitate communications between differing communications technologies or protocols employed in wireless applications. For example, an existing wireless protocol may be employed for a current session but as conditions change such as movement away from one access point toward another, it may be desirable to change the actual technology or communications protocol employed<br><br><br>
WO 1007/051184	PCT/US2006/060330<br><br>
to facilitate future communications. In this case, tune away is provided to support inter radio access technology (inter-RAT) applications.<br>
[0011] To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative embodiments are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways in which the embodiments may be practiced, all of which are intended to be covered.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023] Systems and methods are provided for processing wireless signal components for a mobile wireless access broadband service. This can include processes for defining a protocol that controls whether to invoke a tune away component to determine an alternative wireless communications path. This can include defining a protocol that specifies one or more tune away parameters for the tune away component. The process can then automatically select the alternative wireless communications path based in part on the tune away procedure and at least one of the tune away parameters.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/081184	-PCT/US2006/060330<br>
By tuning away in this manner to determine alternative communications channels, both inter-frequency handoff applications and inter radio access technology handoffs can be achieved to support a broad range of wireless applications.<br>
[0024] As used in this application, the terms "component," "mechanism," "system," and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a communications device and the device can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate over local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a wired or wireless network such as the Internet). <br>
[0025] Fig. 1 illustrates a mobile broadband wireless access system 100. The system 100 includes one or more access terminals 110 that communicate between terminals 110 an in accordance with an access network 120, where an access network are the connections and associated electronic components that link a core network to points of presence (POP) and on to Points of Interconnect (POI) switch locations. Such terminals 110 can include substantially any type of communicating device such as a cell phone, computer, personal assistant, hand held or laptop devices, and so forth. In general, the access terminals 110 are in a mobile situation where communicating according to one particular access network 120 may not always be possible. Thus, one or more tune-away mechanisms 130 can be provided to facilitate communications between such terminals 110.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, various protocols are provided for the tune-away component or mechanism 130 that can be employed by components such as the access terminals 110 and the access network 120 to determine an optimum channel for communications. The protocol 130 enables signaling between the access components that initiates automated procedures to determine if an alternative frequency and/or technology is available for use in wireless communications.   The protocol 130 can<br><br><br>
WO 2007/081184	-PCT/US2006/060330<br>
include employment of a tune-away attribute and a tune-away control message to control such aspects as tune-away duration times, tune-away periods, timing frame parameters, and whether or not to enable or disable a tune-away sequence. By employing such protocol 130, optimal communications channels can be automatically selected as wireless devices are mobilized from one point to another. <br>
[0027] The tune-away mechanisms and protocols 130 basically allow the terminals 110 and network 120 to determine alternative communications paths by temporarily tuning away from an existing path and sampling a subsequent path for suitable employment in on-going communications. "For example, a signal strength may be measured on an alternative frequency while tuning away from a current frequency employed for communications. If a suitable signal threshold is detected, the alternative frequency can be automatically selected for future communications. As illustrated, tune-away mechanisms can be provided to support inter-frequency tune-away applications at 140 and/or support inter radio access technology (inter-rat) applications at 150.<br>
[0028] To facilitate inter-frequency handoff between communications channels at 140, an Active Set is extended to include members from one or more frequencies. This implies that the Active Set consists of Sectors from one or more frequencies. The Sector from different frequencies may be synchronous or asynchronous with respect to each other. To facilitate adding another frequency sector into the Active Set, the mobile broadband wireless access system 100 provides the ability for the access network 120 to specify other frequency neighbors in a sector parameters message specified in an overhead messages protocol. This includes the ability for the active terminal 110 to report other frequency Sector Pilot strength in a Pilot Report message specified in an Active Set Management Protocol. Another aspect includes the ability for access network 120 to specify other frequency members in an Active Set Assignment message specified in the Active Set Management Protocol.<br>
[0029] Generally, in order to report other frequency Sector Pilot strength, the active terminal 110 takes measurements at various times and intervals. In an Idle mode where no on-going communications are detected, it is straight-forward since the receiver is available for other frequency measurements. In order to report Pilot strength in Connected Mode, either dual receivers or temporary tune-away mechanism 130 is provided. Since one can not always assume availability of dual receivers, the tune-away<br><br><br>
 WO 2007/081184	-PCT/US2006/060330<br>
mechanism 130 is provided to facilitate determination of alternative communications paths. Furthermore, similar tune-away mechanisms 130 are also provided for inter-RAT handoff 150 and listening for Pages for another technology that may be asynchronous to the mobile broadband wireless access (MBWA) system 100.<br>
[0030] As noted above, the MBWA system 100 supports Idle and Connected Mode Inter-RAT Handoe. The tune-away mechanisms 130 are provided to facilitate handoff from MBWA system to other radio access technologies as well. The system design assumes that the handoff policy for Inter-RAT Handoff reside in the access terminal 110 but other architectures are possible. Tn other words, the trigger for measurement of other technology and the handoff decision algorithm generally reside in the access terminal 110.<br>
[0031] For inter-rat 150 technologies, the same tune-away mechanisms can be employed as provided for the Inter-frequency handoff to measure other radio access technology Pilot signals. In addition, a Sector Parameters message in an Overhead Messages Protocol provides ability to send other technology Neighbor List. These two mechanisms provide the access terminal with the ability to find other radio access technologies in the neighborhood, and measure the Pilots for other technologies.<br>
[0032] In another embodiment, the MBWA system 100 supports reception of Page messages for other radio access technologies. There are typically two distinct mechanisms provided although other configurations are possible. In one case, tune-away mechanism 130 receives pages for other systems. In another case, an inter RAT Protocol in a Session layer provides sending an Inter RAT Blob (binary large object) message from the access terminal 110 or the access network 120. The first case is useful when the MBWA system 100 has no integration in a core network with the other radio access technologies. Hence, one way to get a Page message from the other technology is by listening to its Paging Channel. The tune away mechanism 130 supports tuning away for listening to paging channels at very specific times in other radio access technologies that are both synchronous and asynchronous to the MBWA system 100.<br>
10033] In general, the tune-away mechanism 130 can be employed to sample frequencies by having timing knowledge of both the access terminals 110 and the access network 120.   This can include being able to sample technologies in a manner that<br><br><br>
■WO 2U07/0S1184	- PCT/US2006/U60330<br>
enables mitigating missing pages from a purely random sample since the system can determine sampling times that account for synchronous and asynchronous timing differences between terminals 110 and network 120. For example, this can include providing sampling schedules that are outside of a frequency frame or allow sampling within a sector.<br>
[0034] Fig. 2 illustrates an example timing diagram 200 for a tune-away component. A tune away mechanism or component generally consists of a tune away schedule and tune away control. A Tune Away Schedule N attribute parameter provides a component to communicate tune away schedule(s) between access terminals and access points or nodes. An example tune-away timing schedule is depicted in the diagram 200. In this schedule 200, it is assumed that the first tune away occurred during a Super frame defined by a Super frame Number 210 provided in a Tune Away Schedule N parameter. Furthermore, more refined time of a first tune away is a Start Super frame Offset parameter 220 e.g., microseconds from the beginning of the Super frame identified at 210. A Tune Away Duration 230 is how long in microseconds the access terminal tunes away. A Tune Away Periodicity parameter 240 determines the time between the start of successive tune away in units of microsecond. The access terminal can negotiate one or more tune away schedules if desired. More than one schedule may be needed for example to monitor pages of one system and also tuning away for inter-frequency handoffs.<br>
[0035] The tune-away control mechanism described above provides at least two functions including: Enable/Disable tune-away, and providing time correction to the tune away schedule. The access terminal can Enable or Disable tune away schedules at substantially any time. Furthermore, the access terminal can Enable or Disable more than one schedule at the same time. The time corrections are typically provided for time critical tune-away to receive pages for a system that is asynchronous to MBWA system. In this example, whenever a new sector is added to an active set, the access terminal provides a correction factor, Sector Offset in units of microseconds to correct time so that the access terminal tunes away at the right time in the other system to receive a page. A Tune Away Request parameter and Tune Away Response messages in a Default Connected State Protocol provides a mechanism to reliably enable/disable tune-away or provide time correction for any Sector in the Active Set.<br><br><br>
 WO 2007/081184	-PCT/US2006/060330<br>
[0036] Fig. 3 illustrates example schedule timing considerations 300. At 310, some example schedule considerations arc provided. For instance at 310, if a tune-away begins or ends in middle of a PHY Frame, a general rule is to tune away for an entire Frame. Referring briefly back to Fig. 2, a Super frame begins at 210 and basically starts with a Super frame preamble data packet followed by a series of PHY frames {e.g., 1 Super frame = 1 preamble followed by 12 PHY frames). Super frame boundary considerations can include if a tune-away period causes the access terminal to miss a system information block, the access terminal shall maintain tune-away for the validity period of the system information block which can be set for different times if desired. In one embodiment, the validity period can be set for two super frames although other settings can be employed.<br>
[0037] Figs. 4-8, illustrate tune-away processes and protocols for wireless signal processing. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series or number of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the processes described herein are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the subject methodologies disclosed herein.<br>
[0038] Fig. 4 illustrates one or more inter-frequency protocol considerations 400 for automated tune-away procedures and handoff between frequencies or technologies. The considerations 400 can include one or more message parameters 410. Such parameters can include message data, sector data, local data, registration data, channel data, pilot strength data, and so forth.<br>
[0039] Proceeding to 420, an active set management protocol includes a pilot report message. This message can be employed to operate channels and add pilots from other frequencies such as via the channel fields in the above table. At 430, active set assignments can be provided. In some case, same frequency pilots can be specified in the active set whereas other cases differing pilot frequencies can be specified for the active set.<br>
[0040] Fig. 5 illustrates a connected state protocol 500 for a tune-away component. The connected state protocol 500 includes a Tune Away attribute 510 that provides a<br><br><br>
 WO 2007/081184	-PCT/US2006/060330<br><br>
tune-away schedule. A Tune Away Control message 520 enables or disables tune-away mechanisms, provides time correction to a tune-away schedule, and/or can be employed for Asynchronous Sectors. [0041]       The  tune away attribute can include parameters from the following table:<br><br>

[0043] Fig. 6 illustrates one or more inter radio access technology considerations 600 for connected mode. At 610, an access terminal makes a handoff decision between one technology and a subsequent one. A Handoff Policy is generally implemented at the access terminal, whereas the access node may assist in the Handoff process. This can include providing other RAT Neighbor Lists (e.g.. Level 1/Level 2 systems) and facilitating tune-away detection processes. At 620, the access terminal detects a trigger condition such as detecting that signal quality on a current channel is below a predetermined threshold. To start measuring the other technology a command can be sent to measure a Current Active Set Pilot Strength which can include other triggers as well. To handoff to the other technology, the Current Active Set Pilot Strength is determined, another RAT Pilot Strength is determined, and any other trigger employed to enable the handoff. At 630, one or more other RAT Neighbor Lists may be employed. This can include processing an Overhead Message Protocol, a Sector Parameters Message, or other RAT neighbor lists as described above. At 640, a tune-away procedure can be automatically initiated to measure other Frequency Pilots which is similar in nature to the Inter-Frequency Handoff procedures described above.<br>

latitude parameters, longitude parameters, registration parameters, time and year parameters, and synchronous or asynchronous timing parameters. Other parameters include channel parameters, pilot parameters, power parameters, and technology parameters such as a technology type and technology neighbor list specifications. <br>
[0045] Fig. 8 illustrates a hybrid mode protocol 800 for paging systems that employ automated tune-away processes. In this embodiment, pages are received for other radio access technologies (RAT). This can include concurrent registration one frequency versus some other technology. Systems may be synchronous or asynchronous to a given system.<br>
[0046] The hybrid protocol 800 enables tune away to listen for Pages that may have been sent to a user or system. This includes employment of the Tune Away mechanisms described above.<br>
[0047] This may also include Cross Registration for Paging systems in order to communicate technology and protocol information. Also, support mechanisms can be provided to send/receive other system BLOBs (binary large objects). This can be useful for Registration or Paging messaging aspects. Other features include a New Session Layer Protocol, an Inter RAT Protocol, an InterRATBlob message, and/or an access terminal or an access node used to send other RAT messages. The access network or access terminal sends the following blob message 820 when it has another RAT message to send.<br><br>

The system 900 can employ various standards and protocols to facilitate communications. <br>
[0049] Fig. 10 illustrates a system 1000 that can be utilized in connection with a tune-away. System 1000 comprises a receiver 1002 that receives a signal from, for instance, one or more receive antennas, and performs typical actions thereon (e.g., filters, amplifies, downconverts, ... the received signal and digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples. A demodulator 1004 can demodulate and provide received pilot symbols to a processor 1006 for channel estimation.<br>
[0050] Processor 1006 can be a processor dedicated to analyzing information received by receiver component 1002 and/or generating information for transmission by a transmitter 1014. Processor 1006 can be a processor that controls one or more portions of system 1000, and/or a processor that analyzes information received by receiver 1002, generates information for transmission by a transmitter 1014, and controls one or more portions of system 1000. System 1000 can include an optimization component 1008 that can optimize allocation of resources during a tune-away. Optimization component 1008 maybe incorporated into the processor 1006. It is to be appreciated that optimization component 1008 can include optimization code that performs utility based analysis in connection with assigning user devices to beams. The optimization code can utilize artificial intelligence based methods in connection with performing inference and/or probabilistic determinations and/or statistical-based determination in connection with optimizing user device beam assignments. <br>

system 1000 can employ stored protocols and/or algorithms to increase system capacity. It will be appreciated that the data store (e.g., memories) components described herein can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable ROM (EEPROM), or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation, RAM is available in many forms such as synchronous RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), enhanced SDRAM (ESDRAM), Synchlink DRAM (SLDRAM), and direct Rambus RAM (DRRAM). The memory 1010 of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise, without being limited to, these and any other suitable types of memory. The processor 1006 is connected to a symbol modulator 1012 and transmitter 1014 that transmits the modulated signal.<br>
[0052] Fig. 11 illustrates a system that may be utilized in connection with performing a tune-away and/or allocating resources during a tune-away. System 1100 comprises a base station 1102 with a receiver 1110 that receives signal(s) from one or more user devices 1104 via one or more receive antennas 1J 06, and transmits to the one or more user devices 1104 through a plurality of transmit antennas 1108. In one example, receive antennas 1106 and transmit antennas 1108 can be implemented using a single set of antennas. Receiver 1110 can receive information from receive antennas 1106 and is operatively associated with a demodulator 1112 that demodulates received information. Receiver 1110 can be, for example, a Rake receiver (e.g., a technique that individually processes multi-path signal components using a plurality of baseband correlators,...), an MMSE-based receiver, or some other suitable receiver for separating out user devices assigned thereto, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. For instance, multiple receivers can be employed (e.g., one per receive antenna), and such receivers can communicate with each other to provide improved estimates of user data. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 1114 that is similar to the processor described above with regard to Fig. 10, and is coupled to a memory 1116 that stores information related to user device assignments, lookup tables related thereto and the like. Receiver output for each antenna can be jointly processed by receiver 1110 and/or<br><br><br>
