CATALYST COMPOSITION FOR TREATING HEAVY FEEDSTOCKS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the cracking of heavy feedstocks<br>
such as vacuum gas oils and heavy oils derived from feedstocks such as<br>
tar sands and shale oils. More particularly the present invention relates to<br>
the fluid bed catalytic cracking (FCC) or moving bed catalytic cracking of<br>
heavy feedstocks to produce a high amount of lower olefins and<br>
particularly alpha olefins with gasoline and diesel cuts as co-products and<br>
a reduced amount of coking.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites have been available for many years. Zeolites are alumina<br>
silicate complexes formed of layers of ring structures. The resulting<br>
structure has a controlled pore size which may include or exclude<br>
molecules of different sizes. Different zeolites having different ratios of<br>
aluminum to silica have a different unit structure on a molecular level and<br>
tend to have a different pore size.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,858,556 published February 22, 2005 in the name of<br>
Kuvettu, et al., assigned to the Indian Oil Corporation Limited, discloses a<br>
process for cracking heavier feedstocks in the presence of a stabilized<br>
dual zeolite catalyst having a particle size in the range of 30-100 microns<br>
to produce a gasoline fraction and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fraction<br>
typically lower alkanes (e.g. ethane, propane and butane). The patent<br>
does not suggest using a high pore volume component in the zeolite nor<br>
does the patent teach producing olefins.<br><br><br>
EP application 0 925 831 published June 30, 1999 to Guan et al.,<br>
assigned to China Petrochemical Corporation and Research Institute of<br>
Petroleum Processing, Sinopec teaches a method for cracking heavy oil.<br>
The oil is cracked in a fluid bed cracker in the presence of a catalyst<br>
comprising one or more zeolites and a pillared clay. The present invention<br>
has eliminated the essential feature of a pillared clay from the '831 art.<br>
The zeolites are conventional zeolites and have not been treated with<br>
alkali. The '831 application does not disclose or suggest the subject<br>
matter of the present invention.<br>
United States Patent 3,894,934 issued July 15, 1975 to Owen et al.,<br>
assigned to Mobil oil Corporation teaches cracking a hydrocarbon feed in<br>
the presence of a small pore zeolite and a large pore zeolite in a weight<br>
ratio of 1:10 to 3:1. The small pore zeolite has a pore size not exceeding 9<br>
angstroms (0.9 nanometers) and the large pore size zeolite has a pore<br>
size greater than about 9 angstroms (0.9 nanometers) (Col. 3 lines 30 -<br>
35). The feed has an initial boiling temperature from 400°F to 1100°F<br>
(204°C to 594°C) to produce a gasoline cut and a lower paraffin or olefin<br>
stream which can be used to enhance the octane number of the resulting<br>
gasoline stream. The subject matter of the '934 patent teaches away from<br>
the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
Ogura et al. (Masaru Ogura, Shin-ya Shinomiya, Junko Tateno,<br>
Yasuto Nara, Mikihiro Nomura, Eiichi Kikuchi, Masahiko Matsukata,<br>
Applied Catalysis A: General, 2001, 219, 33-43) found that a<br>
morphological change of ZSM-5 particles by the alkali-treatment could be<br>
observed and many cracks and faults were formed on the outer surface of<br><br>
zeolite grains or particles. Mesopores having a uniform size were formed<br>
in the zeolite particles, although the microporous structure remained under<br>
the conditions used in their work. In addition, they also found that the<br>
catalytic activity for cumene cracking was enhanced by the treatment.<br>
Their result indicated that alkali-treatment led to an increase in the number<br>
of adsorption sites and also in the diffusivity of benzene through zeolite<br>
micropores. The enhancement in catalytic performance can be explained<br>
due to the fact that the adsorptive-diffusive property of ZSM-5 is improved<br>
by alkali-treatment.<br>
Suzuki et al. (Tetsuo Suzuki, Toshio Okuhara, Microporous and<br>
Mesoporous Materials, 2001,43, 83-89) declared that the NaOH-treatment<br>
of MFI zeolite brought about the increases in total surface area and<br>
external surface area. The increase in the surface areas was due to the<br>
formation of the supermicropores having about 1.8nm in diameter, while<br>
the ultramicropores remained almost unchanged in the size and the<br>
volume. The supermicropores would be formed by the dissolution of<br>
tallites of MFI. The rate-determining step of dissolution of MFI zeolite<br>
would be the diffusion process of NaOH aqueous solution into the newly<br>
formed supermicropores.<br>
Groen et al. (J.C. Groen, L.A.A. Peffer, J.A.Moulijn, J.Perez-<br>
Ramirez, Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects, 2004,<br>
241, 53-58) studies are focused on the evolution and optimization of the<br>
porous structure by varying treatment time and temperature, using N2- and<br>
Ar-adsorption. N2-adsorption experiments have shown that optimization of<br>
the alkaline treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite leads to a combined porous<br><br>
material with an increased mesoporosity and preserved microporosity. An<br>
optimal treatment of commercial ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 37) in 0.2M NaOH<br>
at 338 K for 30 min results in a spectacular increase of mesopore surface<br>
area from 40 to 225m2/g (~450%) and a relatively small decrease in<br>
microporosity (25%). The mesopore formation is a result of preferential<br>
dissolution of Si from the zeolite framework. Variation of treatment time<br>
and temperature enables a certain tuning of the mesopore-size and<br>
volume. XRD (X ray diffraction) analysis evidences the long-range<br>
ordering to remain intact, while low-pressure Ar-adsorption confirms the<br>
preserved microporosity in the optimal alkaline-treated zeolite. Controlled<br>
desilication in ZSM-5 by an optimal alkaline treatment opens new<br>
approaches in the development of combined micro- and mesoporosity in<br>
catalyst design.<br>
It is known, ZSM-5 having a lower framework (structure) silica to<br>
alumina (e.g. SiO2/Al2O3) ratio can be obtained from the alkali treatment of<br>
ZSM-5. To synthesize a zeolite having an ultra-low framework Si/AI ratio<br>
is not easy. It will require a longer time, higher temperature with lower<br>
crystallinity and yields. During the desilication process, the lower<br>
SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be obtained through extracting siliceous species from<br>
the framework of ZSM-5. These results have also been reported by Ogura<br>
et al. (Masaru Ogura, Shin-ya Shinomiya, Junko Tateno, Yasuto Nara,<br>
Mikihiro Nomura, Eiichi Kikuchi, Masahiko Matsukata, Applied Catalysis A:<br>
General, 2001, 219, 33-43) and Wang D Zh et al. (Wang D Zh, Shu<br>
Xingtian, He Mingyuan, Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2003, 24(3), 208-<br>
212.).<br><br>
The present invention seeks to provide a catalyst based on mixed<br>
and modified zeolites, preferably alkali modified to reduce the Si/AI ratio<br>
and increase the pore size/volume (meso-large pore BET surface area<br>
(defined as the total BET surface area minus the micro-pore BET surface<br>
area) of greater than 50 m2/g) suitable for cracking a heavy oil feed to<br>
produce a high amount of lower (C2-4) olefins, and a gasoline and diesel<br>
cut which catalyst has a lower propensity for coking.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used in this specification meso-large pore BET surface area<br>
means the total surface area of the zeolite (catalyst) minus the micro-pore<br>
surface area (e.g. the surface area of pores having a diameter less than<br>
about 0.9 nanometers). This may be determined by methods known in the<br>
art such as N2 adsorption at low temperature.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention comprise from 10 to 75<br>
weight % of a mixture of one or more zeolites selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
(i) an alkaline treated shape selective zeolite having a structure<br>
in which the silica to alumina ratio is less than 45 and a meso-large pore<br>
BET surface area of greater than 50 m2/g;<br>
(ii) an olefin selective zeolite having a structure in which the<br>
silica to alumina ratio is less than 70;<br>
(iii) a beta zeolite having a structure in which the silica to<br>
alumina ratio is less than 100; and<br>
(iv) a Y-faujasite type zeolite having a structure in which silica to<br>
alumina ratio is less than 30.<br>
In the present invention, a zeolite which may be treated with alkali<br>
(e.g. typically a shape selective zeolite for olefins) for example, the<br><br>
commercially available NaZSM-5 (it has a framework or structure having a<br>
silica to alumina ratio from 25 to 200, preferably from 35 to 100 was<br>
treated with a weak, typically less than 0.5 M alkaline solution at 20°C to<br>
350°C, preferably at 50°C to 200°C, after this treatment, usual workup<br>
(such as washing, drying, etc) was done, and it afforded the sodium form<br>
of AT Zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio less than 45, in the preferred<br>
case it is less than 40, in the more preferred case it is less than 35. The<br>
resulting alkaline treated sodium form zeolite may be, preferably is, ion<br>
exchanged into the proton form of zeolite, or it may be directly ion<br>
exchanged to rare earth or other metal ion form of zeolite.<br>
While any of the zeolites used in the catalyst of the present<br>
invention may be alkali treated typically the zeolites which may be alkali<br>
treated include MFI-type zeolites, MEL-type zeolites such as ZSM-11,<br>
ZSM12, MTW-type zeolites such as ZSM-12, MWW-type zeolites such as<br>
MCM-22, and BEA-type zeolites such as zeolite beta. MFI-type zeolites<br>
are preferred. Typically the zeolites which may be treated with alkali have<br>
a silica/alumina ratio above 10 (or Si/AI ratio above 5), preferably above<br>
30, and up to 12 rings in a structural unit. Generally these zeolites are<br>
olefin selective zeolites.<br>
MFI-type zeolites are as defined in the ATLAS OF ZEOLITE<br>
STRUCTURE TYPES, W. M. Meier and D. H. Olson, 3rd revised edition<br>
(1992), Butterworth-Heinemarm, and include ZSM-5, ST-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-<br>
11, silicalite, LZ-105, LZ-222, LZ-223, LZ-241, LZ-269, L2-242, AMS-1B,<br>
AZ-1, BOR-C, Boralite, Encilite, FZ-1, NU-4, NU-5, T5-1, TSZ, TSZ-III,<br>
TZ01, TZ, USC-4, USI-108, ZBH, ZB-11, ZBM-30, ZKQ-1B, ZMQ-TB.<br><br>
Preferably, the zeolite which is alkali treated is selected from the<br>
group consisting of ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-35, ZSM-38,<br>
and combination thereof. Most preferably, the zeolite which is alkali<br>
treated is ZSM-5 in this invention.<br>
After treatment with the alkali the zeolite should have a meso-large<br>
pore BET surface area of greater than 50 m2/g, preferably greater than 80<br>
m2/g. The ratio of silica to alumina in the zeolite should be less than 45<br>
preferably less than 40, most preferably less than 35.<br>
The second zeolite which may be used in the present invention is<br>
an olefin selective zeolite having a structure in which the silica to alumina<br>
ratio is less than 70, preferably less than 40. These types of zeolites are<br>
the same as the above groups of zeolites except they have not been<br>
treated with alkali. Preferably the zeolites used as component (ii) will have<br>
a meso-large pore BET surface area less than 40 m2/g, preferably less<br>
than 30 m2/g.<br>
The third zeolite component which may be used in the present<br>
invention may be a beta zeolite having a structure in which the silica to<br>
alumina ratio is less than 100.<br>
The fourth zeolite component may be a Y-faujasite type zeolite<br>
having a structure in which silica to alumina ratio is less than 30.<br>
The above zeolites may undergo further treatment (it is noted that<br>
the first component is alkali treated but the other components may also be<br>
alkali treated). The treatment may be, in any order, selected from the<br>
group of treatments consisting of:<br><br>
(a)	impregnating the zeolite with a phosphorus compound to<br>
provide from 0.2 to 15, typically from 3 to 12, weight % calculated as P2O5<br>
based on the weight of the 2:eolite and either concurrently or subsequently<br>
treating the impregnated zeolite with steam and/or water at a temperature<br>
from 110°C to 800°C at a pressure from 103.3 kPa to 6.89X103 kPa for a<br>
time from 0.1 to 20 hours;<br>
(b)	treating the zeolite with one or more group IVB, VB, VI B and<br>
VIII metal compounds to provide from 0.1 to 10 weight % of the metal<br>
based on the weight of the zeolite; and<br>
(c)	treating the zeolite with one or more rare earth compounds to<br>
provide from 0.1 to 10 weight % of the oxide of the rare earth metal based<br>
on the weight of the zeolite.<br>
The impregnation of zeolites with phosphorus compounds and a<br>
calcination treatment is known to improve olefin selectivity. The<br>
phosphorus compounds may be selected from the group consisting of any<br>
phosphorus-containing compound having a covalent or ionic constituent<br>
capable of reacting with hydrogen ions. Some useful phosphorus<br>
compounds include, for example phosphoric acid and its salts such as<br>
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate,<br>
ammonium hypophosphate, ammonium orthophosphate, ammonium<br>
dihydrogen orthophosphate, ammonium hydrogen orthophosphate,<br>
triammonium phosphate, phosphines, and phosphites. Suitable<br>
phosphorus-containing compounds also include derivatives of groups<br>
represented, by PX3, RPX2, R2PX , RP02, RPO(OX)2, PO(OX)3,<br>
R2P(0)OX, RP(OX)2, ROP(OX)2, and (RO)2POP(OR)2, wherein R is an<br><br>
alkyl radical, preferably C1-6, most preferably C1-4 alkyl radical or phenyl<br>
radical which is unsubstituted or may be substituted with up to three C1-6,<br>
preferably C1-4 alkyl radicals and X is hydrogen atom, R (as defined above)<br>
or a halogen atom, preferably chloride or fluoride. These compounds<br>
include primary, RPH2, secondary, R2PH, and tertiary, R3P, phosphines<br>
such as butyl phosphine; tertiary phosphine oxides, R3PO, such as tributyl<br>
phosphine; primary, RP(O)(OX)2, and secondary, R2P(O)OX, phosphonic<br>
acids such as benzene phosphonic acid; esters of the phosphonic acids<br>
such as diethyl phosphonate, (RO)2 P(O)H, dialkyl phosphinates,<br>
(RO)P(O)R2; phosphinous acids, R2POX, such as diethylphosphinous<br>
acid, primary, (RO)P(OX)2, secondary, (RO)2POX, and tertiary, (RO)3P,<br>
phosphites; and esters thereof such as monopropyl ester, alkyldialkyl<br>
phosphinites, (RO)P2, and dialkyl phosphonite, (RO)2PR esters. Examples<br>
of phosphite esters include tirimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite,<br>
diisopropyl phosphite, butyl phosphite; and pyrophosphites such as<br>
tetrapyrophosphite. The alkyl groups in the mentioned compounds contain<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms. Other suitable phosphorus-containing compounds<br>
include phosphorus halides such as phosphorus trichloride, bromide, and<br>
iodide, alkyl phosphorodichloridites, (e.g. (RO)PCI2), dialkyl<br>
phosphorochloridites, (e.g. (RO)2PCI), alkyl phosphonochloridates, (e.g.<br>
(RO)(R)P(O)CI), and dialkyl phosphinochloridates, (e.g. R2P(O)CI).<br>
Preferably, said phosphorus source is selected from the group consisting<br>
of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and diammonium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, ammonium hypophosphate, ammonium orthophosphate,<br>
ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, ammonium hydrogen<br><br><br><br>
exchanged zeolite. The metal element may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of the nitrate, sulfate, sulfide, chloride, bromide, fluoride,<br>
acetate, carbonate, perchlorate, phosphate of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and<br>
Cu and combinations thereof. The amount of metal, in the form of metal<br>
oxide, is to provide a concentration in said zeolites in the range of from<br>
about 0.1 to about 15, preferably less than 12, typically less than 10 weight<br>
percent of the weight of the zeolite. This corresponds to about 0.1 to 8<br>
weight % based on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
The zeolites of the present invention may also be treated<br>
(impregnated or ion exchanged) with one or more rare earth compounds to<br>
provide from 0.1 to 10 weight % of the oxide of the rare earth metal based<br>
on the weight of the zeolite. This corresponds to about 0.1 to 7 weight %<br>
based on the weight of the total catalyst.<br>
The zeolite components, whether treated or not may be combined<br>
and used in the catalyst of the present invention. The sum of the zeolite<br>
components in combination must be 100 weight %. In zeolite component<br>
systems one zeolite (e.g. component (i)) may be present in an amount<br>
from 10 to 90, typically 15 to 80, preferably from 30 to 55 weight % of the<br>
total zeolite content and the other component (e.g. zeolite (ii)) may be<br>
present in an amount from 90 to 10, typically 85 to 20, preferably from 70<br>
to 45 weight %. While the inventions encompass four component zeolites<br>
blends typically the catalyst comprises 2 or 3 zeolites. In two component<br>
systems zeolites components (ii), or (iii) or (iii) may be present in an<br>
amount from 90 to 30, typically 75 to 45 preferably from 70 to 45 weight %.<br>
In three and four component systems typically two zeolite components<br><br>
(e.g. (i) and (ii)) form a predominant amount of the zeolites while the other<br>
zeolite components (e.g. (iii) and (iv)) are used in amounts typically less<br>
than 20 weight % (e.g. 30 to 45 weight % of zeolite component (i), 30 to 45<br>
weight % of zeolite component (ii) and from 10 to 40 weight % of one or<br>
more of zeolite components (iii) and (iv)).<br>
The catalyst also comprises a matrix component typically selected<br>
from the group consisting of clays, synthetic matrix other than pillared clay,<br>
and mixtures thereof. The matrix should be a substance capable of<br>
calcining or firing to form a hard mass or particles. Kaolin is a readily<br>
available clay which can be fired to form a hard mass or particles although<br>
any clay including montmorillonites, smectites, and illites types of clay<br>
could be used. The matrix may be used in amounts form 15 to 55 typically<br>
30 to 50 weight % of the final catalyst.<br>
The catalyst also comprises a sol or a gel of a binder selected from<br>
the group consisting of oxides of aluminum, silicon and mixtures there of.<br>
The sol or gel may be used in amounts from 10 to 20 weight % of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
The catalyst may also include from 0 to 15, typically less than 10,<br>
preferably less than 8 weight % of an oxide of a group IVB or VB metal.<br>
Some useful oxides include titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide and<br>
vanadium dioxide, preferably titanium dioxide.<br>
The catalyst is prepared by forming a slurry of the above<br>
components. For example the matrix and the binder may be combined<br>
and then the zeolite(s) are added and the resulting slurry/ mixture is<br>
mechanically mixed (e.g. using a stirrer) to form a uniform mixture. The<br><br>
slurry is then formed into particulates having a size from about 0.001 to 0.8<br>
mm, preferably from 0.005 to 0.150 mm. The slurry may be formed into<br>
particulates in any manner. The slurry could be formed into particulates by<br>
spray drying the resulting slurry at a temperature from 100°C to 650°C,<br>
followed by calcining the resulting solid at a temperature from 500°C to<br>
800°C. The slurry could be dried for example at a temperature from 100°C<br>
to 200°C, typically less than 150°C. The resulting solid product could then<br>
be calcined at a temperature from 500°C to 800°C for a time from 1 to 20<br>
hours and subject to a size seduction step - (comminution step (e.g.<br>
crushed, ground, milled, etc. into smaller particulates)). Then the product<br>
could, if necessary be treated with steam, water or both at a temperature<br>
from temperature from 110°C to 800°C, a pressure from 103.3 kPa to<br>
6.89X103 kPa for a time from 0.1 to 20 hours. Optionally the catalyst could<br>
be treated with 0 to 15 weight % of a phosphorus compound calculated as<br>
P2O5 based on the weight of the catalyst (prior to steam/water treatment).<br>
If necessary, the resulting dried catalyst could be ground or milled until it<br>
has the required particle size In another embodiment the gel could be<br>
extruded as particles and subjected to the required treatment in the<br>
required order. The formation of catalyst particulates is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention provides the catalyst made in accordance<br>
with the above teachings.<br>
The catalysts are suitable for cracking and in particular fluid<br>
catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy feeds such as vacuum gas oil from the<br>
treatment of oil sands, shale oils and heavy crudes having a boiling point<br><br>
greater than 300°C, preferably greater than 350°C, preferably greater than<br>
400°C. Some of the properties of suitable heavy feed stocks are set out in<br>
Tables 3 and 7 of the examples below. The catalysts of the present<br>
invention produce a higher amount of light olefins particularly ethylene,<br>
propylene and some butene together with a gasoline and diesel fraction<br>
while producing less coke make.<br>
The process is typically conducted in a continuous manner in a<br>
reactor having at least one side riser to introduce a mixture of fresh and<br>
regenerated catalyst and a regenerator with a cyclone to decoke the<br>
catalyst and separate off gases.<br>
Typically the cracking is conducted at a temperature from 500°C to<br>
800°C and a pressure from 103.3 kPa to 6.89X103 kPa to produce more<br>
than 15% of C2-4 olefins, and gasoline and diesel cuts as co-products, and<br>
having a coke make of less than 18%, preferably less than 12%.<br>
The ratio of water (or steam or hydrogen) to oil may be from 0.45 to<br>
0.60 typically 0.5 to 0.6 preferably about 0.55.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may be regenerated by<br>
heating it to "burn" the coke off, typically at temperatures from 500°C to<br>
800°C, preferably from 600 to 750°C.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by the following non<br>
limiting examples.<br>
Alkaline Treated ZSM 5 (AT - ZSM-5)<br>
The sodium form of ZSM-5 zeolite was treated with 0.2 molar NaOH<br>
at 100°C for about 30 minutes. The treatment extracted silica and reduced<br>
the ratio of SiO/AI2O3 to about 25 (compared to a ratio of about 40 in the<br><br>
untreated ZSM-5 (sodium form). The resulting alkaline treated ZSM-5<br>
zeolite was ion exchanged into the proton form in a conventional manner.<br>
For comparative purposes the starting sodium form of the ZSM-5<br>
catalyst was converted to the proton form.<br>
The alkaline treated ZSM-5 zeolite (sodium form) was analyzed by<br>
x-ray diffraction and the resulting pattern is shown in figure 1. The XRD<br>
pattern indicates that the basic micropore structure of the ZSM-5 zeolite is<br>
preserved in the course of alkaline treatment, i.e. the material's crystal<br>
phase is still ZSM-5 type zeolite, no other detectable zeolite (or crystal)<br>
phase formed.<br>
The alkaline treated ZSM-5 zeolite in proton form was subjected to<br>
N2 adsorption and desorption at 77°K. The N2 adsorption-desorption<br>
isotherms is shown in figure 2. The figure shows a clear appearance of a<br>
characteristic hysteresis loop, which suggests that mesopore or large-pore<br>
structure(s) are formed in the alkaline treated ZSM-5 zeolite.<br>
The BJH pore size distribution curve of the alkaline treated ZSM-5<br>
zeolite (proton form) obtained based on the same N2 adsorption and<br>
desorption experiment, is shown in figure 3. From this pore size<br>
distribution curve, one can infer that the treatment formed meso- to large-<br>
pore structure(s) upon alkaline treatment, and gives us the pore size<br>
distribution information.<br>
There is no obvious difference in the shape of XRD pattern, N2<br>
adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curve between<br>
the sodium form of AT-ZSM-5 and proton form of AT-ZSM-5.<br><br>
Table 1 shows a comparison of the properties of the starting sodium<br>
form of the ZSM-5 zeolite (NaZSM-5), the alkaline treated ZSM-5 zeolite<br>
(e.g. still sodium form, AT-NaZSM-5) and the protonated form of the<br>
alkaline treated ZSM-5 zeolite (AT-HZSM-5). The data in Table 1 indicate<br>
that the alkaline treatment increase the pore size/volume obviously, its<br>
meso-large pore BET surface area increased from 20.7 m2/g to 136.2 m2/g.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
This example discloses the differences of product selectivity and<br>
yields between a catalyst made with alkali treated ZSM-5 (AT-ZSM-5,<br>
proton form) and the catalyst made using ZSM-5 which has not been<br>
alkaline treated but is in proton form (HZSM-5).<br>

100% of steam at 750°C for 6 hours.<br>
Catalytic pyrolysis testing of feedstock is performed in a standard<br>
fluidized bed reactor system. The reactions are carried out at 660°C, the<br>
ratio of catalyst to oil is 15.50 (m/m), and the ratio of water to oil is 0.55<br>
(m/m) (all the examples listed below use the same reaction condition).<br>
The performance of the catalysts is reported in Table 2.<br>

The results show that the catalyst containing AT-ZSM-5 zeolite has<br>
higher ethylene and propylene yields, higher yields of total olefins and<br>

Example 7<br>
This example discloses the differences of product selectivity and<br>
yields of a catalyst prepared with AT-ZSM-5, in-situ phosphorus steam<br>
modification and employing metal oxide additives and a catalyst prepared<br>
using ordinary ZSM-5, ordinary phosphorus modification procedure and<br>
without metal oxide additives.<br><br>
Catalyst 15 (Uses AT-ZSM-5, In-Situ Phosphorus Steaming Modification<br>
And Employs Metal Oxide Additives)<br>
The catalyst uses HZSM-5 zeolite, AT-ZSM-5, beta zeolite and type<br>
zeolite as active components, clay as matrix, and aluminum sol as binder.<br>
A total of 5% (mass) of P2O5 is loaded by directly spraying the<br>
diammonium phosphate (NH4)2HPO4) water solution onto the hot active<br>
component at 580°C in a rotary tube over 3 hours.<br>
The catalyst components and preparation method are as follows:<br>
37% (mass) of kaoline and 6% of TiO2 (anatase) are added to 17% (mass)<br>
of alumina binder, stirring for 30 min, then the 40% (mass) of phosphorus<br>
modified active components (it includes 35% (mass) of phosphorus<br>
modified HZSM-5 (SiO2/AI2O3=38) zeolite, 35% (mass) of phosphorus<br>
modified AT-ZSM-5 zeolite (same with that in Catalyst 1), 30% (mass) of<br>
phosphorus modified beta zeolite (SiO2/AI2O3=25)) are added to the<br>
mixture, and the mixture is mechanically mixed to form a homogeneous<br>
slurry. The slurry is spray dried at an inlet temperature of 500°C and then<br>
the obtained particulates calcined at 600°C for 4 hours. The obtained<br>
catalyst particulates had a size from 0.010 to 0.130 mm. Then the catalyst<br>
is aged with 100% steam at 750°C for 6 hours. The performance of the<br>
catalyst is listed in Table 10 (the same HVGO feedstock as shown in Table<br>
3 was used).<br>
Catalyst 16 (Uses Ordinary ZSM-5, Ordinary Phosphorus Modification<br>
Procedure And Without Metal Oxide Additives)<br>
The catalyst uses HZSM-5 zeolite and beta zeolite as active<br>
components, clay as matrix, and aluminum sol as binder. A total of 5%<br><br>
(mass) of P2O5 is loaded on active components by ordinary incipient<br>
wetness impregnation technique.<br>
The catalyst components and preparation method are as follows:<br>
43% (mass) of kaoline and 17% (mass) of alumina binder, stirring for 30<br>
min, then the 40% (mass) of phosphorus modified active components (it<br>
includes 70% (mass) of phosphorus modified HZSM-5 (SiO2/AI2O3=38)<br>
zeolite, 30% (mass) of phosphorus modified beta zeolite (SiO2/AI2O3=25))<br>
are added to the mixture, and the mixture is mechanically mixed to form a<br>
homogeneous slurry. The slurry is spray dried at an inlet temperature of<br>
500°C and then the obtained particulates calcined at 600°C for 4 hours.<br>
The obtained catalyst particulates have a size from 0.010 to 0.130 mm.<br>
Then the catalyst is aged with 100% steam at 750°C for 6 hours. The<br>
performance of the catalyst is listed in Table 10 (the same HVGO<br>
feedstock as shown in Table 3 was used).<br><br>
These results shown in Table 10 indicate that the catalyst using AT-<br>
ZSM-5, in-situ phosphorus steaming modification and metal oxide<br>
additives shows better light olefin selectivity and more useful products<br><br>
(such as gasoline and LCO) and lower yield of slurry and coke compared<br>
with the corresponding catalyst using the ordinary material and<br>
modification procedure. The conversions are defined as 100% minus the<br>
percentage of obtained slurry (heavy oil).<br><br>
