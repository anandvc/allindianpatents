The invention relates to novel 2-ethyl-4,6-dimethylphenyl-substituted spirocyclic tetramic acid derivatives, to a plurality of processes and intermediates for their preparation and to their use as pesticides and/or herbicides. Moreover, the invention relates to novel selective herbicidal active compound combinations comprising both the 2-ethyl-4,6-dimethylphenyl-substituted spirocyclic tetramic acid derivatives and at least one crop plant compatibility-improving compound, which combinations can be used with particularly good results for the selective control of weeds in various crops of useful plants.<br>
3-Acylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones are described as having pharmaceutical properties (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. .15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones were synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985, 1095). A biological activity of these compounds has not been described.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds of a similar structure (3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones); however, a herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action of these compounds has hitherto not been described. Unsubstituted bicyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) having herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are known.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and lH-aryl-pyrrolidinedione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 93/26954, WO 95/20 572, EP-A 0 668 267, WO 96/25 395, WO 96 35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 97/43275, WO/98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/24437, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/09092, WO 01/17972, WO 01/23354, WO 01/74770 and WO 03/013249).<br>

Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations defined above of substituted ketoenols of the general formulae (I) and (I-a) and safeners (antidotes) from the component (c') listed above, while having very good compatibility with useful plants, have a particularly high herbicidal activity and can be used in various crops, in particular in cereals<br>
(especially wheat), but also in soybeans, potatoes, maize and rice, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
Here, it has to be considered to be surprising that, from the large number of known safeners or antidotes capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a herbicide on the crop plants, it is in particular the compounds of component (c') listed above which are suitable to compensate the damaging effect of substituted cyclic ketoenols on the crop plants almost completely, without negatively affecting the herbicidal activity against the weeds to any considerable extent.<br>
Emphasis may be given here to the particularly advantageous effect of the particularly preferred and most preferred combination partners from component (c'), in particular with respect to sparing cereal plants, such as, for example, wheat, barley and rye, but also maize and rice, as crop plants.<br>

If appropriate, the compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention may<br>
also be used in certain concentrations or application rates to act as herbicides. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds or active compound combinations is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, habitat or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering or painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br><br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such as alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be used as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, for example in order to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the development of resistances in this way. In many cases, synergistic effects result, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared with these formulations, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore exist in the form of a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds by which the activity of the active compounds is increased without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide ranges. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 up to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
They are applied in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound or active compound combinations is distinguished by excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants or their parts in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species or plant varieties and plant cultivars which have been obtained by traditional biological breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast fusion, and the parts of these varieties and cultivars are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars which have been obtained by recombinant methods, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and their parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Plants which are treated particularly preferably in accordance with the invention are those of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with new traits which have been bred either by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may take the form of cultivars, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used in accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or better nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics and/or processibility of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by recombinant methods) to be treated in accordance with the invention include all those plants which, owing to the process of recombinant modification, were given genetic material which confers particular, advantageous, valuable traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics and/or processibility of the harvested products. Further examples of such traits, examples which must be mentioned especially, are better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses and an increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soybeans, potato, cotton, oilseed rape, beet, sugar cane and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), with particular emphasis on maize, soybeans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits which are especially emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against insects, owing to toxins being formed in the plants, in particular toxins which are generated in the plants by the genetic material of Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CryIA(b), CrylA(c), CryUA, CrylUA, CryIJJB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and their combinations; hereinbelow "Bt<br>
plants"). Other traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by the systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Other traits which are especially emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example "PAT" gene). The genes which confer the desired traits in each case may also be present in the transgenic plants in combination with one another. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soybean cultivars and potato cultivars which are commercially available under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soybeans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars and soybean cultivars which are commercially available under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soybean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinothricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include also the varieties commercially available under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Naturally, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously with the compounds according to the invention or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds and mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis may be given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials, such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber products, and paint.<br>
The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by insects are wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood cladding, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wooden' materials comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined upon use in each case by a test series. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C.<br>
Substances which are used as such oily and oil-type solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 280°C, essence of turpentine and the like.<br>

The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>

Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

However, the use of the active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for the nonselective weed control on, for example, industrial terrains and railway tracks and on paths and locations with and without trees. Likewise the active compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity and a broad activity spectrum when used on the soil and on aerial plant parts. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both pre- and post-emergence.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microcapsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insectides, acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, plant nutrients and soil conditioners, is also possible.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be applied as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are applied in the customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied both before and after plant emergence. They can also be incorporated into the soil prior to sowing.<br>
The application rate of active compound can vary within a substantial range. Essentially, it depends on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the application rates are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil area, preferably between 5 g and 5 kg per ha.<br>
The advantageous effect of the compatibility with crop plants of the active compound combinations according to the invention is particularly pronounced at certain concentration ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, from 0.001 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, of one of the compounds which improves crop plant compatibility (antidotes/safeners) mentioned above under (c') are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are generally applied in the form of finished formulations. However, the active compounds contained in the active compound combinations can, as individual formulations, also be mixed during use, i.e. be applied in the form of tank mixes.<br>
For certain applications, in particular by the post-emergence method, it may furthermore be advantageous to include, as further additives in the formulations, mineral or vegetable oils which are compatible with plants (for example commercial preparation "Rako Binol"), or ammonium salts, such as, for example, ammonium sulphate or ammonium thiocyanate.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. Application is in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, dusting or scattering.<br>
The application rates of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be varied within a certain range; they depend, inter alia, on the weather and on soil factors. In general, the application rates are between 0.001 and 5 kg per ha, preferably between 0.005 and 2 kg per ha, particularly preferably between 0.01 and 0.5 kg per ha.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied before and after emergence of the plants, that is to say by the pre-emergence and post-emergence method.<br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners to be used according to the invention can be used for pretreating the seed of the crop plant (seed dressing) or can be introduced into the seed furrows prior to sowing or be used separately prior to the herbicide or together with the herbicide, before or after emergence of the plants.<br>

164.7 mg (0.5 mmol) of the compound of Example I-a-2 (see page 83) and 55.65 mg (0.5 mmol) of triethylamine are initially charged in 8 ml of ethyl acetate and heated under reflux. 59.7 mg of methoxyacetyl chloride in 2 ml of ethyl acetate are added to the mixture. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours. After the reaction has ended, 5 ml of sodium chloride solution are added, the organic phase is extracted with ethyl acetate and the aqueous phase is adjusted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution to pH 7. The mixture is again extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried and the solvent is distilled off.<br>
The product is purified by silica gel column chromatography using ethyl acetate.<br>

Use examples Example A<br>
Herbicidal post-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam in wood fibre pots, covered with soil and cultivated in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. 2-3 weeks after sowing, the test plants are treated at the one-leaf stage. The test compounds, formulated as wettable powders (WP), are, in various dosages with a water application rate of 600 1/ha (converted), with 0.2% of wetting agent added, sprayed onto the green parts of the plants. After the test plants were kept in the greenhouse under optimum growth conditions for about 3 weeks, the effect of the preparations is rated visually in comparison to untreated controls (herbicidal effect in per cent (%): 100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).

Example B<br>
Herbicidal post-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam in wood fibre pots or in plastic pots, covered with soil and cultivated in a greenhouse, during the vegetation period also outdoors outside of the greenhouse, under good growth conditions. 2-3 weeks after sowing, the test plants are treated at the one- to three-leaf stage. The test compounds, formulated as wettable powders (WP) or emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are, in various dosages with a water application rate of 300 1/ha (converted), with wetting agent (0.2 to 0.3%) added, sprayed onto the plants and the surface of the soil. 3-4 weeks after the treatment of the test plants, the effect of the preparations is rated visually in comparison to untreated controls (herbicidal effect in per cent (%): 100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).<br>
Use of safeners<br>
If it is additionally to be tested as to whether safeners can improve the plant compatibility of test substances in the case of crop plants, the following options are used for applying the safener:<br>
-	seeds of the crop plants are, before sowing, dressed with the safener substance (the amount of safener is stated in per cent, based on the weight of the seed)<br>
-	before the application of the test substances, the crop plants are sprayed with the safener at a certain application rate per hectare (usually 1 day before the application of the test substances)<br>
-	the safener is applied together with the test substance as a tank mix (the amount of safener is stated in g/ha or as a ratio, based on the herbicide).<br>
By comparing the effect of the test substances on crop plants without or with safener treatment, it is possible to assess the effect of the safener substance.<br>
