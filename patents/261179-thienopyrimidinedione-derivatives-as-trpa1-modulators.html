Technical Field<br>
The present patent application relates to thienopyrimidinedione derivative as TRPAl modulators with transient receptor potential ankyrinl (TRPAl) activity,<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels or receptors are pain receptors. They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTM1) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPC1 (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRPV3 and is more closely related to TRPV 1 and TRPV2 than to TRPV5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following; the founding member TRPM1 (melastatin or LTRPC1), TRPM3 (KIAA1616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMR1), TRPM5 (MTR1 or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPML1 (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPP1 (PKDK PCI), PKD-REJ and PKD-1L1 are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTM1.<br><br>
It is believed TRPAI is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPA1 is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel, it is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPAI is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson LJ et al. Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAI ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAI receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAI is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals<br>
The difference between TRPAI and other TRP receptors is that TRPAI ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g.. pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required.<br>
WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions.<br>
In efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPA1.<br>

Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in<br><br>
Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett &amp; F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed.. 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as "nociceptors". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and A5 fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, (henna) and proton (pH
Chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).<br>

A genera} approach for the synthesis of thieno{2,3-d]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the general formula (la'), wherein R1, R2, U and V are as defined above is prepared as described in Scheme 2. Synthesis starts from commercially available 1,3-dialkylbarbifuric acid of the formula (5). The known 6-chloro-5-formyl-I,3-dimethyluracil (6) is prepared according to the reported procedure (Singh. J. S. et al, Synthesis 1988. 342-344) by formylation of intermediate (5) with POCl3 and DMF, The treatment of 6-chloro-5-formyl-l,3-dialkyluracil (6) with hydroxylamine in methanol followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxychloride give 6-chloro-5-cyano-l,3-dimethyluracil of formula (7). Treatment of compounds of the formula (7) with alkyl mercaptoacetate of the formula (8) (wherein R is alkyl) in the presence of suitable base affords amino ester of the formula (9) through a coupling reaction followed by insitu cyclization. This conversion is similar to described by Moloi, Y. et al,./. Heterocyclic Chem.. 1990. 717-721. The amino ester (9) on diazotization followed by haiide substitution with copper halide (such as copper bromide or copper iodide) affords an intermediate of the formula (10) where X is halogen. Aryl halide of formula (10) on reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (11) . in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(O) gives allyl derivative of the formula (12) [e.g. a procedure similar to the Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling described by Kotha, et al, Synlett 2005, 12, 1877-1890]. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of allyl thiophene derivative of the formula (12) using copper in the<br><br>
presence of quinoline at elevated temperature gives the allyl thienopyrimidinedione of the formula (14) | procedure is similar to that is reported by Ludo.. \i. ,1. Kermis, et a! in Biorg. &amp; Med.

Functionalized thiophene of the formula (18) is prepared by a one pot 3-component coupling reaction (Gewald's synthesis) using malononitrile, appropriate aldehyde and sulfur powder (Byrn, S. R. et al, ./. Pharm, Sci., 2001, 90, 371). The compound of the formula (18) is converted into compounds of formula (19) by a sequence of transformations well known in the art of organic synthesis. Cyclisation of compounds of the formula (19) with triphosgene gave<br><br>
the compounds of the formula (20). which on selective N-alkylation afforded compounds of the formula (21). Halogenation of formula (21) (e.g.. A'-bromosuccinimide or N-iodosuccinimide in (he presence of BlVelherate or irifluromeihanesulphonic acid) gave compounds of the formula (22), This conversion is according to procedure reported by George, O. L. ct al. ,/. Am. Chem. soc. 2004. 126. 15770-15776.

In one approach N,N'-dimcthyl urea is condensed with acetic anhydride in presence of pyridine as reported by Egg, H. et al in Synthesis, 1982. 1071-1073. Alternatively, intermediate (26) can be prepared by alkylation of 6-methyluracil according to the procedure reported by Siverman. R. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1982.<br><br>

A similar procedure is reported by Tsupak, 15. B. el a) in J. Chemistry heterocyclic compounds, 2003, 39, 953-959|. Cyclisation of the compounds of the formula (27) by. Gewald's synthesis gives expected 5-methylthieno[3,4-d]pyrimidinedione of the formula (28) as described by Tormyshey, V. M. et al in Synlett, 2006, 2559-2164). Reaction of compounds of formula (28) with dialkyl carbonate in the presence of suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent gives the diester of the formula (29). Dealkoxycarbonylation of compounds of the formula (29) using suitable base such as sodium hydride or using DMSO/NaCl/water afforded desired thieno[3.4-d]pyrimidinedione ester of the formula (30). Coupling reaction of ester of the formula (30) with appropriate amines of formula (2) by using suitable base such as sodium hydride in the presence of suitable solvent such as dry toluene or xylene gave compounds of general formula (lb').<br><br><br>
of formula (33) can be converted lo ester of the formula (34) by reaction of (33) with dialkyl carbonate in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride followed by dealkoxycarbonylalion as described in Scheme 4.

An alternative approach for the synthesis of thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidinyl acetamides of the formula (lb') wherein Rl. R2, U and V are as defined above is shown in Scheme 6. Formylarion of uracil derivative (26) with phosphorous oxychloride and dry DMF gave 5-formyl derivative of the formula (35) as described by Shirahashi M. et al, in Yakugaku Zasshi, 1971. 91, 1372. Treatment of 5-formyl derivative (35) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxychloride gave 5-cyano derivative of the formula (36). A similar approach is reported by Hirota. K. et al in Heteocycle, 1998. 47, 871-882). Aminothiophene of the formula (37) is obtained by reaction of intermediate of formula (36) with sulfur powder and morpholine under Gewald's reaction conditions. Amino thiophene (37) on diazotization followed by halide substitution with a metal halide such as copper bromide or copper iodide affords a halide derivative of the formula (38). Aryl halide of the formula (38) can be transformed into allyl thiophene of the formula (39) by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (11) in the presence of Pd(0) catalyst. Allyl thiophene of the formula (39) can be converted into thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidinylacetic acid of the formula (40) by oxidative cleavage of the terminal double bond as described in Scheme  1. The coupling of compounds of formula (40) with amines of the general<br><br>

Scheme 8 depicts synthesis of 2-amino-4-aryl thiazoles of the formula (46) (wherein R4, R5, R6; R7 R8 and R9 are as defined above) which is prepared from acetophenones of the formula (45) using known approaches. Certain di-and tri-substituted acetophenones were not commercially available and they were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid derivative of formula (41) in three steps. Thus, acid of formula (41) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (42) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (42) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula<br>
(44)	by treating with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (43) in the<br>
presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of alkyl magnesium iodide<br>
to Weinreb amide of formula (44) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (45).<br>
Conversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (45) to 2-amino-4-substituted aryl thiazole of the formula (46) can be effected by two approaches as described in Scheme 8. In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula<br>
(45)	can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryJ thiazole (46) in one step by its reaction with<br>
thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanoi (Carroll, K. et a!. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1950. 3722<br>
and Naik, S. J.; Halkar, U. ?.,ARK1V0C. 2005, xiii 141-149).<br><br>
Synthesis of 2-amino-4-arylimidazolamine of the formula (48) (wherein R4, R5, R6, R7 R8 and R9 are as defined above) is described in Scheme 9. Thus, reaction of acetophenone derivative of formula (45) with bromine in acetic acid gives phenacyl bromide, which on reaction with acetyl guanidine in acetonitrile at reflux temperature gives N-acetyl imidazole of the formula (47). The N-deacetyiation of (47) under acidic<br><br>
conditions affords 2-amino-4-arylimidazoles of the formula (48). This is similar to the procedure reported by Thomas, L. et al in .J. Org, Chem.. 1994, 59, 7299-7305.<br><br>
Some of the 5-amino-3-phenylpyrazoies used for the synthesis of compounds of present invention were commercially available. Commercially unavailable 3-amino-l-arylpyrazoles were prepared as shown in Scheme 10. Reaction of phenylhydrazine derivative of formula (49) with acrylonitrile in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium ethoxide or sodium methoxide in refluxing ethanot affords the dihydro derivative of compound of formula (50). Intermediate (50) on oxidation with A'-bromosuccinimide as described by Duffin. G. F. et al, ./. Chem. Soc, 1954, 408-415. gives 3-amino-l-arylpyrazoles derivative of formula (51) (wherein R4, R5.

Pharmacological activity<br>
The illustrative examples of the present invention are screened for TRPA1 activity according to a modified procedure described in (a) Tolh. A. el al. Life Sciences, 2003, 73, 487-498. (b) McNamara C, R. el al, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A., 2007, 104, 13525-13530. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Screening for TRPA1 antagonist using the 45Calcium uptake assay:<br>
The inhibition of TRPA1 receptor activation was measured as inhibition of ally! isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl2 to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPA1 expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 ug / ml of G-418. Rat TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMFM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 ug / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 µM (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 µM (for rat TRPA1) and 5 µCi/ml 4,5Ca+2 for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant. (Toth et al, Life Sciences (2003) 73, 487-498; McNamara CR et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, (2007)104, 13525-13530).<br>
Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. IC50 values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.<br>
The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in 'fable 2 and 3 for human and rat respectively. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 µM and 10.0 µM are given in the tables along with IC50<br><br>
(nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 2 and 3 wherein ;'A': refers to an IC50 value of Jess than 50 nM, "B" refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 500.0 nM.<br>
