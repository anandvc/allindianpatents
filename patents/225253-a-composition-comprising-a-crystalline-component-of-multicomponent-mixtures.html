				<td>APPLICATION FOR LETTERS PATENT<br>
TITLE: CRYSTALLINE MIXTURES OF PARTIAL METHYL ETHERS OF<br>
BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN AND RELATED COMPOUNDS<br>
Cross-reference to Related Applications<br>
This application takes priority from provisional patent application 60/164.949 <br>
November 12, 1999.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to mixtures of partial ethers of cyclodextrins that have the<br>
ability to crystallize and the use of these mixtures to solubilize and stabilize other<br>
compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cyclodextrins are a group of compounds consisting of, or derived from, alpha-,<br>
beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, so called parent cyclodextrins. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-<br>
cyclodextrin are crystalline oligosaccharides consisting of six, seven or eight glucose<br>
residues, respectively, with residues connected by 1 i.o 4 alpha glycosidic bonds to form a<br>
macrocycle. Cyclodextrins have the ability to include other compounds into their<br>
macrocycles. No chemical bonds are formed in this process, called formation of inclusion<br>
complexes. Cyclodextrins function as hosts, while the included compounds are called<br>
guests. Inclusion complexes formed by cyclodextrins have been useful for solubiiizing<br>
and stabilizing guests such as drugs, ingredients of cosmetic and personal care products,<br>
dyes, agricultural chemicals and inorganic nanoparticles.<br>
To improve the ability to form inclusion comolexes, parent cyclodextrins have to<br>
be converted to derivatives. Each glucose residue of a cyclodextrin has one primary (OH-<br>
6) and two secondary (OH-2 and OH-3) hydroxyls that can be substituted (for example,<br>
converted into ethers). The final product obtained by such reactions can be either<br>
chemically distinct cyclodextrin derivatives, or mixtures whose components are partially<br>
etherificd cyclodextrins that differ in number and position of substituents.<br>
Known mixtures of cyclodextrin derivatives exist in stable, noncrystalline (that is,<br>
amorphous) form. Partial methyl ethers of cyclodextrins synthesized under strongly basic<br>
conditions provide widely used amorphous mixtures (U.S. Patent 5,710,268; World<br>
Intellectual Property Organization 94/02516; U.S. Patent 4,746,734; German Patent<br>
294,267). Compositions of matter containing partially methylated derivatives of<br>
cyclodextrins can be synthesized under conditions of very low basicity, (minimal effective<br>
basicity). (See U.S. Patent 5,681,828. U.S. Patent 5,935,941; U.S. Patent 6,001,821;<br>
World Intellectual Property Organization 92/22630.) The components of the latter<br>
mixtures are relatively few in number with substitution of the secondary hydroxyis<br>
predominating. Nevertheless, the mixtures prepared were found to exist in an amorphous<br>
state. Amorphous mixtures of partial 2-hydroxypropyl ethers of cyclodextrins (U.S.<br>
Patent 5,096,893; U.S. Patent 4,870,060) belong to this class and are produced using<br>
strong to moderately strong basicities.<br>
Many chemically individual (and crystalline) cyclodextrin derivatives are known<br>
(A. R. Khan, et al., Chemical Reviews, 98, 1977-1996, 1998; A. R. Hedges, Chemical<br>
Reviews, 98,2035-2044, 1998). Those of significant use include maltosyl-beta-<br>
cyclodextrin, which is produced industrially by enzymatic reaction (U.S. Patent<br>
4,931,389), and heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin produced by reaction in<br>
strongly basic medium in presence of barium salts (U.S. Patent 4,542,211). From the<br>
multitude of research generated compounds made by methods not suited for scale up,<br>
several chemically individual and crystalline methyl and 2-hydroxypropyl ethers of beta-<br>
cyclodextrin are known (K. Takeo et al., Die Starke 28,226-227, 1976; K. Takeo et al.,<br>
Carbohydrate Research, 187,203-221, 1989; C. T. Rao et al., Journal of Organic<br>
Chemistry, 56,1327-1329,1991; J. Jindrich et al., Carbohydrate Research, 266, 75-80,<br>
1995). It was believed that the crystallinity of these particular compounds was dependent<br>
on their being present as separate distinct entities, not as mixtures. The possibility of the<br>
existence of a crystalline lattice, which can accommodate a number of cyclodextrin<br>
derivatives of the kind described herein was not considered.<br>
Water-soluble cyclodextrin derivatives, after their preparation, have to be separated<br>
from water-soluble by-products, i.e., inorganic salts and small molecular weight organic<br>
compounds. This has been done by diffusion-based processes, by demineralization with<br>
ion exchange resins, or by precipitation with organic solvents (A. R. Hedges, Chemical<br>
Reviews, 98,2035-2044, 1998). In diffusion-based processes, the aqueous solution of<br>
product and by-products is brought into contact with a semi-permeable membrane which<br>
may, depending on the method of manufacture, permit only molecules that are smaller<br>
than those of the product to diffuse through. The other side of the membrane is in contact<br>
with water, or at least is covered by water. The smaller molecules of the by-product flow<br>
through the membrane to the aqueous side, where their concentration is lower. Molecules<br>
of water, since they obey the same physical law, flow in the opposite direction. This water<br>
flow leads to undesirable dilution of the desired product and can be prevented, or even<br>
reversed, by an increase of pressure on the product/by-product side. In the dialysis<br>
process, as used in the laboratory, the pressure on the product/by-product side of the<br>
membrane is not large enough to prevent fully the flow of water across the membrane into<br>
the desired product. Sturdy instrumentation that permits pressure large enough to prevent<br>
that flow or even reverse it, is known as reverse osmosis instrumentation. Use of reverse<br>
osmosis instrumentation to remove specific by-products, but not calcium salts, from<br>
cyclodextrin derivatives was disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,831,081.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
The present invention provides means for making certain mixtures of cyclodextrin<br>
derivatives that can be separated into crystalline and noncrystalline (amorphous)<br>
components. The crystallization does not lead to separation of individual compounds.<br>
Rather, both the crystalline and noncrystalline components remain as mixtures of more<br>
than one compound. Crystalline and amorphous states are associated with different and<br>
distinct advantages. The present invention enables access to compositions having the<br>
advantages of both states from one reaction product. The data provided herein show that<br>
components of both crystalline and amorphous states may have similar numbers of<br>
substituents per cyclodextrin residue: it is the position of substituents that is critical for<br>
determining crystallization properties of particular cyclodextrin products.<br>
The invention provides compositions of matter comprising mixtures of partial<br>
ethers of parent cyclodextrins containing a crystalline component and an amorphous<br>
component wherein the crystalline component is comprised of cyclodextrins wherein total<br>
ether substituents are less than two times the number of glucose residues. It is possible to<br>
obtain therefrom a crystalline component containing mixtures of partial ethers of<br>
cyclodextrins. These crystalline cyclodextrins can form new, useful inclusion complexes<br>
with active agents such as drugs, agricultural chemicals, reaction agents, cosmetics, dyes<br>
and catalysts.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
During methylation of beta-cyclodextrin using calcium hydroxide (i.e., base of<br>
minimal effective basicity) and low temperature, it was observed that crystals started to<br>
separate from concentrated solutions of the product. The crystalline phase thus obtained<br>
contained, in a single crystal, a multitude of chemically individual compounds, which<br>
among other aspects, differed by the number of methyls per molecule. This set apart the<br>
present composition of matter from compositions of previous art, in which existence of the<br>
single crystalline phase was associated with chemical individuality. Using these crystals<br>
as a seed, crystallization of other mixtures of partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin<br>
made in conditions of minimal effective basicity was possible. Crystalline phases were<br>
eventually obtained, but with much lower yields, from the corresponding derivatives of<br>
alpha-and gamma-cyclodextrin and from similar mixtures of partial hydroxypropyl ethers<br>
of beta-cyclodextrin, partial carboxymethyl ethers cf beta-cyclodextrin and partial ethyl<br>
ethers of beta-cyclodextrin. In all of these cases, including partial methyl ethers of beta-<br>
cyclodextrin. reaction products contained both crystalline and amorphous phases.<br>
Crystalline mixtures of partial methyl ethers of cyclodcxtrins of the present<br>
invention can be made in forms which vary in extent of overall substitution, in ease of<br>
crystallization, in solubility in water and in capacity to act as hosts in formation of<br>
inclusion complexes. Noncrystalline components of the compositions of matter of the<br>
present invention can also vary in degree of substitution and in their capacity to act as<br>
hosts.<br>
The majority of cyclodextrin derivatives in use at present are amorphous mixtures*.<br>
From the user's point of view, the main advantage of amorphous character of a mixture is<br>
that it confers to its inclusion complexes high solubility. The principal disadvantage of the<br>
amorphous state of a mixture is that untoward properties of the cyclodextrin components<br>
are, given time, fully manifested. Components of amorphous mixtures of partial methyl<br>
and hydroxypropyl ethers of cyclodextrins, which have a high degree of substitution, are<br>
hygroscopic. This invariably leads to stickiness of the whole mixture and to difficulties in<br>
storage and mechanical processing. Another disadvantage is that the word "crystalline"<br>
nearly universally conveys feeling of the purity; the word "amorphous" conveys the very<br>
opposite.<br>
From the view of producer, the amorphous state requires that the crude reaction<br>
product must fulfill all the purity criteria required in final products. None of the<br>
purification methods for use on amorphous compositions are sufficiently cost effective for<br>
large-scale production. Crystalline materials, on the other hand, can be inexpensively<br>
recrystallized until the desired purity is achieved. The effectiveness of recrystallization is<br>
well recognized by regulatory agencies. (Manufacture of pharmaceutical grades of<br>
glucose and sucrose serve as examples.)<br>
In Example 1, a procedure is described for making the crystalline partial methyl<br>
ethers of cyclodextrin using calcium hydroxide. Results show that the level of methylation<br>
of the crystalline components of the mixture do not differ greatly in number of methyl<br>
groups per molecule from those of amorphous components left in mother liquors. The<br>
ease and rapidity with which crystallization of the purified muhicomponent mixture of<br>
partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin occurs suggests that its components are<br>
isomorphous. In Example 1, it also is shown that reverse osmosis instrumentation can be<br>
used effectively to isolate the product.<br>
In Example 2. it is shown that the crystalline phase can be isolated from many<br>
reaction products of cyclodextrins. The products of methylation of beta-cyclodextrin made<br>
using mild bases in addition to calcium hydroxide may also be used in compositions to<br>
provide crystalline products, albeit with lower yields. Results in Example 2 also show that<br>
a number of additional factors impact yields of the crystalline component of the mixtures.<br>
Yields of the crystalline component are improved when lower reaction temperatures and<br>
less alkylation agent are used. These factors are expected to impact crystallization<br>
potential since they diminish the number and variety of individual chemical compounds<br>
present in the reaction product. Surprisingly, there was a difference between alkylating<br>
agents, dimethyl sulfate giving higher yields than methyl iodide. Yields of the crystalline<br>
component were increased when barium ions were added to the reaction mixture. Partial j<br>
methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin were found to crystallize much better than those of<br>
alpha- and gamma-cyclodextrins. Changes in size of substituent (e.g., moving from the<br>
smaller methyl to the larger ethyl, carboxymethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl) substituents also<br>
decreased the ability of derivatives to form crystals. When 2-hydroxypropyl groups were<br>
tested, only components with two or fewer hydroxypropyl groups per cyclodextrin residue<br>
were detectable in crystals obtained.<br>
Results in Example 3 document the structure of components of the crystalline<br>
phase and described some of its properties. A single crystal of a methylation product of<br>
beta-cyclodextrin was grown large enough for all required analyses. That crystal contained<br>
17% of water of crystallization. Analysis of the substitution pattern (J. Reuben,<br>
Carbohydrate Research, 1986, 157,201-213 and references therein) of this crystal revealed<br>
that the only methylation which occurred was that on OH-2 hydroxyls and not all of these<br>
were methylated. Mass spectrum of the same crystal documented that species from one to<br>
seven methyl groups per molecule were present. These results prove that the crystal is<br>
formed by isomorphous 2-O-oligomcthyl beta-cyclodextrins. The absence of methylation<br>
on OH-6 hydroxyls also was documented chemically as shown by ease of formation of<br>
tertiary butyl ethers. Average number of methyls per molecule of the crystalline product<br>
can be manipulated by changes in amount of methylation agent used in preparation.<br>
Increase in that number is accompanied by an increase in solubility in water. When<br>
amounts of methylation agent were increased substantially, species with more methyls than<br>
seven per molecule could be detected in crystalline phase by mass spectrometry. Results<br>
in Example 3 also show that the compositions of matter of the present invention are<br>
different from any partial methyl ethers of cyclodextrin of previous art.<br>
In Example 4, it is shown that both the crystalline and amorphous components of<br>
partial methyl ethers of cyclodextrin preparations are good solubilizers. Hydrocortisone, a<br>
drug that has commonly been used as comparison standard in this field, was solubilized<br>
more efficiently using compositions of the invention than by currently available<br>
cyclodextrin compositions. Hydrocortisone was shown to increase the solubility of<br>
crystalline partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin in water. Example 4 also describes<br>
methods that can be used to produce liquid or solid pharmaceutical formulations. The<br>
same methods are expected to have applications for preparation of personal care products<br>
and formulations used in agriculture.<br>
Results in Example 5 show that the crystalline mixtures containing partial methyl<br>
ethers of cyclodextrin are of low toxicity and that biological activity of guests is unaffected<br>
when using such cyclodextrin derivatives as hosts.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Partly Crystalline Methyl Beta-Cvclodextrin<br>
Calcium oxide, freshly made from calcium hydroxide (23.9 g), was added to water<br>
(400 ml) while cooling. Beta-cyclodextrin hydrate (80 g) was then added while stirring,<br>
followed by dropwise addition of dimethyl sulfate (27.8 ml), which took about two hours.<br>
Stirring at room temperature was continued for four days. The still alkaline reaction<br>
mixture was then saturated with carbon dioxide until pH decreased to 5-6. Thereafter, the<br>
suspension was boiled for a few minutes to expel carbon dioxide and methanol. After<br>
cooling the suspended calcium carbonate was filtered off and the clear filtrate dialyzed<br>
against distilled water. In this particular dialysis, the mechanical pressure on the<br>
product/by-product side of the semipermeable membrane was not large enough to prevent<br>
inflow of water. Nevertheless, by a moderate increase of reverse pressure, it was possible<br>
to decrease inflow, while the removal of calcium salts was not impeded. It also was<br>
possible to obtain separation using a centrifugal filter unit equipped with an ultrafiltration<br>
membrane of nominal molecular weight cutoff of 3000 D. Although this cutoff was higher<br>
than the molecular weight of the product and washing washing was necessary, product was<br>
obtained. Consequently, use of commercially available instrumentation, would be<br>
appropriate for removal of calcium salts (e.g., methylsulfate, sulfate, bicarbonate and<br>
carbonate) which represent the majority of by-products present in the reaction product.<br>
The dialyzed solution of the product can be further purified by treatment with a<br>
solution of sodium carbonate until no calcium carbonate separated. The suspension was<br>
filtered and the filtrate was treated with demineralizing ion exchange resin, filtered again<br>
and evaporated in vacuo to yield 59.7 g of white mass. This white mass was dissolved in<br>
boiling water (60 ml) and left to crystallize. Crystals thus obtained were again<br>
recrystallized at 1:1 w/w (water to crystals), yielding 25.06 g of colorless needles. Mother<br>
liquors, when evaporated to dryness, yielded 30.19 g of white mass. Results of thin layer<br>
chromatography showed that crystals and mother liquors contain partial ethers of<br>
cyclodextrins that do not differ greatly in the number of methyl groups per molecule.<br>
Interestingly, crystals contained less of the beta-cyclodextrin and its monomethyl<br>
derivative than mother liquors. Neither the crystalline component, nor the component<br>
obtained by evaporating of the mother liquor, melted at less than 200 degrees centigrade.<br>
Example 2<br>
Isolation of Crystalline Parts from Various Cvclodextrin Derivatives Prepared in<br>
Conditions of Minimal Effective Basicity<br>
Partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin (1 g), prepared in the conditions<br>
specified in Table 1, were dissolved in water (1 ml) at temperature of boiling water bath.<br>
If, upon cooling, crystals did not appear, the solution was seeded with crystals obtained in<br>
Example 1. After a week of standing at room temperature, the crystals were collected and<br>
weighed. Results in Table 1 show that the yield of crystals improves when methylation<br>
occurs at lower reaction temperatures and with use of less methylation agent. Mother<br>
liquors, when partially evaporated, yielded additional crystals. Beta W7 Ml.8, a<br>
commercial noncrystalline derivative produced by Wacker Biochem Corp., was used as a<br>
control. (Beta W7 Ml.8 is not prepared in conditions of minimal effective basicity.)<br>
Hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin mixtures prepared using calcium hydroxide at room<br>
temperature yielded crystalline components that contained di(2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-<br>
cyclodextrins in addition to the starting beta-cyclodextrin and mono(2-hydroxypropyl)-<br>
beta- cyclodextrins. This was established by thin layer chromatography. Carboxymethyl<br>
substituents may also be present on cyclodextrins in the crystalline component. This was<br>
established by alkylating beta-cyclodextrin using chloroacetic acid, 2 moles per mole of<br>
glucose residue and using calcium hydroxide as a base. Large crystals in low yield were<br>
obtained from the product. Crystalline partial ethyl ethers were obtained by alkylation of<br>
beta-cyclodextrin with ethyl iodide under conditions similar to those used in preparation of<br>
P264 in Table 1. Products of methylation of alpha- and gamma-cyclodextrins were made<br>
using calcium hydroxide. The product, when processed as described above, yielded only<br>
small amounts of fine particles, possibly microcrystals. under these conditions. This<br>
failure to provide larger crystals was probably due to the very high water solubility. When<br>
methanol-propanol mixtures were used, crystals were obtained. The crystallization<br>
occurred slowh. In all the cases, except with partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin,<br>
the yields of crystals were low. Nevertheless, some crystals were obtained. When<br>
conditions of minimal effective basicity were not used, no crystals resulted.<br>
Example 3<br>
Characterization of Crystalline Partial Methvl Ethers of Beta-Cvclodextrin<br>
The crystalline component of P264 (Tablel), after drying at 100 degrees centigrade<br>
in vacuo to remove all of its cystallization in water, was soluble in water at room<br>
temperature to the concentration 15%; at temperature of a boiling water bath, the solubility<br>
was in excess of 50%. The moderate solubility of the crystalline component of P264 in<br>
water at room temperature is not a barrier to achieving a higher total concentration of that<br>
composition in the presence of a suitable drug, as is shown in Example 4. Crystals did not<br>
melt at temperatures of up to 200 degrees centigrade.<br>
When a single crystal of P264 was hydrolyzed, only glucose and 2-O-methyl<br>
glucose were detected in hydrolyzate by I3C-N.M.R. (J. Reuben, Carbohydrate Research,<br>
1986, 157. 201-213). Mass spectrum (FAB in positive ionization mode) of the same<br>
crystal documented the following composition: Beta cyclodextrin not detectable: less than<br>
1% of molecules had one methyl, 3% two methyls, 1:5% three methyls, 41% four methyls,<br>
25% five methyls, 11% six methyls, 3% seven methyls and less than 1% eight methyls.<br>
The absence of substitution on primary hydroxyls (OH-6) in P264 also was<br>
documented chemically. A sample of it was dissolved in trifluoracetic acid and saturated<br>
with isobutylene. This reaction is known to introduce tertiary butyl groups onto primary<br>
hydroxyls. The product isolated form this reaction mixture indeed contained tertiary butyl<br>
groups.<br>
The crystalline component of P258 (Table 1), after drying at 100 degrees<br>
centigrade in vacuo, was soluble in water at room temperature to the concentration 29%; at<br>
temperature of boiling water bath, the solubility was in excess of 50%. Crystals did not<br>
melt at temperatures of up to 200 degrees centigrade. Mass spectrum (FAB in positive<br>
ionization mode) showed that from di- to deca-methyl species were present with<br>
heptamethyl beta-cyclodextrin in the largest quantity. 13C-N.M.R. data shows that about<br>
76% of OH-2 were converted to methyl ether groups (calculated from intensities of C-l<br>
signals).<br>
These results show clear differentiation between the compositions of the present<br>
invention and of the previously known partial methyl ethers of cyclodextrins, both<br>
amorphous and crystalline. The compositions of matter of the present invention differ<br>
from all previously described amorphous materials, since a crystalline state exists therein<br>
and a phase containing the crystalline state can be obtained therefrom. It differs from the<br>
known crystalline heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin, which contains 14 methyls<br>
per molecule, both in terms of number of methyls per moleucle and in effects of<br>
temperature on solubility in water (see Y. Kubota et al., Carbohydrate Research, 192, 159-<br>
166, 1989).<br>
Example 4<br>
Solubilizing Potency of Partial Methvl Ethers of Beta-Cvclodextrins and Their Use in<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
Solubilization potency of cyclodextrin derivatives was compared through<br>
measurement of the solubility of hydrocortisone in 5%(w/w) aqueous solutions of the said<br>
derivatives, which in the case of the crystalline components of P264 and P258 (Table 1).<br>
were used without heat drying. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The concentration limits to which solubilization power of the crystalline<br>
component of P264 can be utilized were investigated in an experiment in which an excess<br>
of hydrocortisone was added to the aqueous system which contained more of the<br>
crystalline component of P264 than it could dissolve. The results in Table 3 show that, in<br>
these conditions, hydrocortisone solubilized additional amounts of the crystalline<br>
component of P264. In other words, the stability and solubility of the inclusion complex is<br>
high enough to lead to dissolution of all host available. Results in Table 3 also show that<br>
the amorphous component of P264, the mother liquors of P264, is a powerful solubilizer as<br>
well.<br>
A solution of a drug suitable for topical or parenteral uses was made by adjusting<br>
the hydrocortisone solution made as in Table 2 to iso;onicity by addition of sodium<br>
chloride. The solution thus made did not deteriorate during storage at room temperature<br>
for several months.<br>
The solutions of hydrocortisone and the crystalline components of P264 and P258,<br>
upon slow evaporation, yield glassy materials, which in some instances were bordered with<br>
traces of apparently crystalline phase products. The inclusion complex of crystalline<br>
partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin is very water soluble. However, with<br>
perseverance the crystalline state could be induced. Tablets suitable for oral or buccal use<br>
were made by direct compression of the residue after evaporation of the above solution of<br>
hydrocortisone inclusion complexes. These tablets dissolved clearly and fully within 2-3<br>
minutes in water.<br>

Bioeffects and Toxicity Issues<br>
The solutions of the crystalline partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin described<br>
above were nontoxic to mice when given as the only source of liquids at 2% concentration<br>
for two days. These solutions have a mildly sweet taste without aftertaste. When given by<br>
intraperitoneal injection, no toxic effects to mice were seen at doses to 6 g per kg; the first<br>
toxic effects were seen at 7 g per kg doses.<br>
To demonstrate that a drug included in crystalline partial methyl ethers of beta-<br>
cyclodextrin retains its potency, the blanching test was used (McKenzie, Archives of<br>
Dermatology, 86, 91-94,1962). An aqueous solution (25 microliters) containing<br>
hydrocortisone (8 mg/ml) and crystalline partial methyl ethers of beta-cyclodextrin (5%)<br>
was applied to the skin of the human forearm. After drying of the droplet by warm air, the<br>
test area was covered by an occlusive bandage overnight. The skin area to which the<br>
solution was applied was then evaluated for signs of blanching comparing the treated areas<br>
of both untreated skin (negative control) and skin to which a hydrocortisone solution (1%)<br>
in ethanol had been applied in a similar manner (positive control, known to produce<br>
blanching). The tested solution produced blanching surpassing that of the positive control.<br>
