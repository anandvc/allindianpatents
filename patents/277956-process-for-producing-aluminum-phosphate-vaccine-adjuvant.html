				<td>This invention relates to process for producing aluminum phosphate<br>
Background<br>
Some vaccines and other medicines contain one or more components called adjuvants which serve to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine antigens, thereby making the vaccine more effective. Studies have shown that many aluminum-containing vaccines elicit higher and more prolonged antibody responses than the same vaccines formulated without the adjuvant. There are several types of aluminum-containing salts ("also referred to as alum") which function as vaccine adjuvants: (i) aluminum phosphate or AIPO4, (ii) aluminum hydroxide or Al(OH)3, and (iii) potassium aluminum sulfate A1K(SO4)2. The effectiveness of each aluminum-containing adjuvant often depends on the characteristics of the specific vaccine and how the manufacturer prepares the vaccine (Baylor et al., "Aluminum salts in vaccines-US perspective," Vaccine 20:S 18-23, 2002). To work as an adjuvant, the antigen typically needs to be adsorbed to the aluminum to keep the antigen at the site of injection.<br>
United States licensed vaccines for children that contain aluminum adjuvants include, without limitation, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, some Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (Hib) vaccines, Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccines, combination DTaP, Tdap, Hepatitis A vaccines, and Human Papillomavirus vaccine.<br>
Prevnar , marketed and sold by Wyeth, is a conjugated pneumococcal vaccine that contains aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant. The antigens in Prevnar® are a mixture of polysaccharides from seven different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, each conjugated to the carrier protein CRM197. Prevnar® is formulated as a clear aqueous liquid containing a colloidal suspension of the antigen - me substance that stimulates the specific protective immune response - adsorbed onto the aluminum adjuvant AIPO4. While methods of producing aluminum phosphate adjuvant have been described, there remains a need in the art for methods that are more efficient and/or sterile, especially on an industrial scale. In addition, it is desirable that any new method produce aluminum phosphate adjuvant with similar physical, chemical and functional characteristics as the aluminum phosphate adjuvant already in commercial use, e.g., in Prevnar®.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention provides improved methods for producing the aluminum adjuvant<br>
AIPO4. These improved manufacturing methods benefit from increased efficiency and/or increased sterility as compared to other methods and are particularly useful on an industrial scale.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method for producing aluminum phosphate which comprises the steps of mixing a solution of aluminum chloride and a solution of sodium phosphate tribasic to produce an aluminum phosphate precipitate, wherein the improvement comprises settling the aluminum phosphate precipitate at a temperature in the range of about 50 °C to about 70 °C.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for producing aluminum phosphate comprising the steps of: (i) mixing a solution of aluminum chloride and a solution of sodium phosphate tribasic to produce an aluminum phosphate suspension and a supernatant; (ii) settling the aluminum phosphate suspension to produce an aluminum phosphate precipitate; and (iii) removing the supernatant, wherein the steps of mixing, settling and removing are performed within a closed system.<br>
These and other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description and from the claims.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
Figure 1 depicts a flow diagram for a method of producing AIPO4.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a flow diagram for an improved method of producing AIPO4.<br>
Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides improved methods for the manufacture of the aluminum adjuvant AIPO4. These methods are especially useful in the industrial-scale manufacture of AlPO4.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a method for producing aluminum phosphate in which aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and sodium phosphate tribasic (Na3PO4) are first prepared separately. The aluminum chloride can be in the form of aluminum chloride hexahydrate. These reagents are then aseptically transferred to a formulation vessel and combined with water (e.g., Water-for-Injection or WFI ). The reaction between these reagents results in the formation of an AIPO4 suspension. The suspension is then transferred into drums for settling at 25 °C. The settling time for this process (i.e., the time required to allow the AIPO4 precipitate to settle in the drums) is approximately 7 to 10 days which represents the slowest step in the overall process.  After settling, the supernatant is removed from<br>
each drum and the precipitated AlPO4 is transferred into a formulation vessel for sterilization-in-place (e.g., &gt; 121 °C, 45 min) and pH adjustment. The final AIPO4 is then transferred into drums for storage. The total batch cycle time of this method on an industrial scale is approximately 10 to 12 days. In addition, the open nature of this process requires that the multiple aseptic manipulations be performed in a clean air environment (e.g., Class 100). This is costly and also necessitates sterility testing. The efficiency of the method depicted in Figure 1 is improved significantly by, inter alia, performing the settling step at higher temperatures. In an improved method that is depicted in Figure 2, after the aluminum chloride, sodium phosphate tribasic and water are mixed to form an AIPO4 suspension, the suspension is allowed to settle at about 50 °C to 70 °C (e.g., 60 °C). The settling time at these higher temperatures is reduced from about 7 to 10 days to between about 2 and 5 days.<br>
Another improvement as compared to the method of Figure 1 involves performing all of the process steps within a closed system. This has the advantage of reducing the risk of contamination (e.g., from bacteria, etc.) thereby increasing the sterility assurance of the final product and reducing the need for sterility testing. Thus, in Figure 2, the supernatant is removed from the formulation vessel (e.g., using a dip tube) and the remaining AIPO4 suspension (still in the same reaction vessel) is sterilized-in-place (e.g., &gt; 121.1 °C, 30 min) before the pH is adjusted. The final AIPO4 product can then be transferred into drums for storage. The total batch cycle time of this method on an industrial scale is approximately 3 to 6 days (i.e., half the cycle time of the method in Figure 1). A reduced cycle time provides an advantage in efficiency. Table 2 provides a side-by-side comparison of some of the differences between the methods depicted in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Based in part on these findings, the present invention provides a method for producing aluminum phosphate which comprises the steps of mixing a solution of aluminum chloride and a solution of sodium phosphate tribasic to produce an aluminum phosphate precipitate, wherein the improvement comprises settling the aluminum phosphate precipitate at a temperature in the range of about 50 °C to about 70 °C. In certain embodiments, the improvement comprises settling the aluminum phosphate precipitate at a temperature in the range of about 55 °C to about 65 °C. In another embodiment, the improvement comprises settling the aluminum phosphate precipitate at a temperature of about 62 °C. In yet another embodiment, the improvement comprises settling the aluminum phosphate precipitate at a temperature of about 60 °C.<br>
As discussed above, these improvements significantly and unexpectedly reduce the aluminum phosphate settling time. For example, in certain embodiments, the settling step may be performed for between about 2 and 5 days as compared to between about 7 and 10 days at lower temperatures. In one set of embodiments, the settling step may be performed for between about 2 and 4 days, e.g., between about 2 and 3 days or between about 3 and 4 days. It will be appreciated that the settling step may be performed for as long as desired within these ranges or even for longer (e.g., 5 or more days) or shorter periods (e.g., less than 2 days). Longer settling periods will generally produce greater yields as compared to shorter settling periods; however, there will also be an efficiency trade-off as a result of the increased duration of the overall manufacturing process. Accordingly, the optimal settling time will need to take both factors into account and will also depend on the exact settling temperature.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for producing aluminum phosphate within a closed system. The use of the closed system significantly improves the sterility assurance of the process. This makes the overall process more efficient since it reduces the number of sterility tests that need to be performed and no longer requires the process to be performed within a clean air environment. As used herein, the term "closed system" means a system in which exposure of the reaction mixture contained inside one or more vessels to the outside environment (e.g., air, oxygen, microbes, and the like) is reduced or prevented. According to this aspect, the inventive method comprises the steps of (i) mixing a solution of aluminum chloride and a solution of sodium phosphate tribasic to produce an aluminum phosphate suspension and a supernatant; (ii) settling the aluminum phosphate suspension to produce an aluminum phosphate precipitate; and (iii) removing the supernatant, wherein the steps of mixing, settling and removing are performed within a closed system.<br>
In certain embodiments, in the mixing step of the above method, the solution of sodium phosphate tribasic is added to the solution of aluminum chloride. The solution of sodium phosphate tribasic is typically added to the solution of aluminum chloride until the pH is in the range of about 5.0 to about 5.4 (i.e., about 5.2 ± 0.2). In certain embodiments, the solution of sodium phosphate tribasic is added to the solution of aluminum chloride until the pH is in the range of about 5.1 to about 5.3.<br>
In certain embodiments, the mixing step of the above method is performed at a temperature in the range of about 20 °C to about 30 °C. In certain embodiments, the mixing step is performed at a temperature of about 25 °C.<br>
In certain embodiments, the mixing step of the above method comprises mixing the solution of aluminum chloride and the solution of sodium phosphate tribasic with an impeller rotating at about 150 rpm to about 350 rpm. In certain embodiments, the mixing step of the above method comprises mixing the solution of aluminum chloride and the solution of sodium phosphate tribasic with an impeller rotating at about 200 rpm to about 300 rpm. In yet other embodiments, the mixing step of the above method comprises mixing the solution of aluminum chloride and the solution of sodium phosphate tribasic with an impeller rotating at about 250 rpm.<br>
In certain embodiments, the settling step of the above method is performed at a temperature in the range of about 50 °C to about 70 °C, i.e., as described in the first aspect of the invention. In certain embodiments, the settling step of the above method is performed at a temperature in the range of about 55 °C to about 65 °C. In another embodiment, the settling step is performed at a temperature of about 62 °C. In yet other embodiments, the settling step is performed at a temperature of about 60 °C. In certain embodiments, the settling step may be performed for between about 2 and 5 days. For example, the settling step may be performed for between about 2 and 4 days, e.g., between about 2 and 3 days or between about 3 and 4 days. It will be appreciated that the settling step may be performed for as long as desired within these ranges or even for longer (e.g., 5 or more days) or shorter periods (e.g., less than 2 days). In certain embodiments, the removing step comprises decanting the supernatant. In certain embodiments, the removing step comprises removing the supernatant using a dip tube.<br>
In certain embodiments, the above method further comprises sterilizing the aluminum phosphate precipitate, wherein the steps of mixing, settling, removing and sterilizing are all performed within a closed system. In certain embodiments, the step of sterilizing comprises heating the aluminum phosphate precipitate to a temperature in excess of about 110 °C. In certain embodiments, the step of sterilizing comprises heating the aluminum phosphate precipitate to a temperature in excess of about 121 °C. In certain embodiments, the above method further comprises adjusting the pH of the aluminum phosphate precipitate, wherein the steps of mixing, settling, removing, sterilizing and adjusting are all performed within a closed system. In certain embodiments, the step of adjusting comprises adjusting the pH of the aluminum phosphate precipitate to be in the range of about 5.6 to about 6.0. In certain embodiments, the step of adjusting comprises adjusting the pH of the aluminum<br>
phosphate precipitate to be in the range of about 5.7 to about 6.0. In certain embodiments, the step of adjusting comprises adjusting the pH of the aluminum phosphate precipitate to be in the range of about 5.8 to about 6.0. In certain embodiments, the step of adjusting comprises adjusting the pH of the aluminum phosphate precipitate to be in the range of about 5.9 to about 6.0.<br>
The inventive methods may be used to produce aluminum phosphate having a variety of concentrations; however, in certain embodiments, the concentration of aluminum phosphate after the above step of mixing is in the range of about 9.0 to 16.5 mg/ml. In certain embodiments, after the above step of adjusting the pH, the aluminum phosphate precipitate includes particles with a size distribution having a D[v, 0.5] (definitions of particular size distribution values are set forth in Example 1 below) in the range of about 3.0 urn to about 9.0 urn, or of about 4.5 urn to about 6.5 µm. In certain embodiments, after the above step of adjusting the pH, the aluminum phosphate precipitate includes particles with a size distribution having a D[v, 0.1] of more than about 1.5 µm, or of more than about 2.0 µm. In certain embodiments, after the above step of adjusting the pH, the aluminum phosphate precipitate includes particles with a size distribution having a D[v, 0.9] of less than about 25 µm, of less than about 24 µm, of less than about 23 µm, of less than about 22 µm, of less than about 21 µm, or of less than about 20 µm.<br>
The present invention will be more specifically illustrated with reference to the following examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited by these examples in any manner.<br>
Examples Example 1 - System/Process Description<br>
This example describes an exemplary system and process for performing some of the methods that are described herein, such as that depicted in Figure 2. In this example, the preparation and batching of the manufacturing process of AIPO4 are controlled via a Media Preparation System (MPS or Media Preparation Skid). The MPS consists of 3 batching vessels (50-L, 200-L, and 800-L), filter housings, and piping with sanitary connections. The manufacturing process utilizes both 200-L (V12) and 800-L (V13) vessels. AIPO4 is thereby produced in 800-L (total volume) batches yielding 350-Kg aluminum phosphate precipitate. The final precipitate is downloaded to 50-L drums.<br>
Raw materials used in this process included:<br>
•	Sodium phosphate tribasic (20.4 Kg)<br>
•	WFI™ (for sodium phosphate tribasic dissolution) (107.4 L)<br>
•	Aluminum chloride hexahydrate (10.1 Kg)<br>
•	WFI™ (for Aluminum chloride hexahydrate dissolution) (91.6<br>
L)<br>
•	5N Sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment)<br>
The first step in the process was to weigh out 20.4 Kg of sodium phosphate tribasic into<br>
the raw material holding container and put it aside. Next, 10.1 Kg of Aluminum chloride<br>
hexahydrate was weighed out into a raw material holding container and put aside.<br>
The automated recipe for aluminum phosphate was initiated and the system underwent a<br>
pressure test.  Vessels V12, V13, and the associated transfer lines were then pre-rinsed<br>
with WFI™.   After the WFI™ rinse, particulate control filters were placed in-line on<br>
both the "filtration side" and "clarification side" of the transfer line between V12 and<br>
V13.  Prior to sampling bulk, a pre-sterilized sample port with C-Flex was connected to<br>
vessel V13.<br>
The system then underwent another pressure hold test. Upon completion of the pressure<br>
hold, the system was flushed with clean steam.   After the steam flush, the previously<br>
installed filters were flushed with a total of 50-L of WFI.<br>
A target of 162.0-L of WFI was then added to V12.  The WFI was then transferred to<br>
V13.  An additional 100-L of WFI was added to V12 and then transferred to V13. The<br>
final critical reaction temperature of 25 °C was established in V13.<br>
A target of 63.0-L of WFI was added to vessel V12.  The agitator associated with V12<br>
was started and was controlled to a target of 350 rpm.   The pre-weighed aluminum<br>
chloride was added to V12 (after a dissolution temperature of 35-45 °C was reached).<br>
After the initial dissolution of the aluminum chloride, V12 was brought up to a target of<br>
91.6-L of WFI and mixed for 5-35 minutes prior to visual verification that the aluminum<br>
chloride had dissolved. Vessel V13 then began agitating the WFI with a setpoint of 250<br>
rpm. The aluminum chloride was then transferred from V12 to V13.<br>
A target of 150-L of WFI was added to V12. The WFI was then transferred to V13 and<br>
additional 150-L of WFI was added to V12 and again transferred to V13. The final<br>
critical reaction temperature of 25 °C was established in V13.<br>
A target of 70-L of WFI was added to V12.   The agitator associated with V12 was<br>
started and was controlled to a target of 350 rpm. The pre-weighed sodium phosphate tribasic was added to V12 (after a dissolution temperature of 35-45 °C was reached). After the initial dissolution of the sodium phosphate tribasic, V12 was brought up to a target of 107.4-L of WFI and mixed for 5-35 minutes prior to visual verification that the sodium phosphate tribasic had dissolved.<br>
The sodium phosphate tribasic was then transferred from V12 to V13 and mixed with the aluminum chloride until a target pH of 5.20 was achieved. After one hour, the pH was again adjusted to a target pH of 5.20 by adding sodium phosphate tribasic. Once the pH was stabilized, the agitator slows to 150 rpm and the temperature setpoint was changed to 60 °C. The agitator was turned off after mixing for one hour. The remaining sodium phosphate tribasic was drained from V12, then particulate filters were removed and replaced with CIP caps, and V12 and the transfer lines underwent the CIP procedure. The aluminum phosphate settled in V13 to below the diptube at a target temperature of 60 °C. Once settling was complete (below the diptube), the supernatant was decanted from V13 via the diptube. The sample valve for V13 was then manually sterilized for 15 min at &gt; 121.1 °C. Once the sample valve had been sterilized and cooled to below 60 °C, two 25 mL bioburden samples were taken.<br>
The aluminum phosphate in V13 was then sterilized for 30 min at &gt; 121.1 °C followed by sterilization of the base addition line (15 in at a temp of &gt; 121.1 °C). Using the sterile connection device, a 1-L bottle of 5N NaOH was connected to the base addition line. One the aluminum phosphate had cooled to a target temperature of 25 °C, the pH of the aluminum phosphate was adjusted to a target of 5.95. Up to 16 pre-cleaned and sterilized 50-L drums were connected to their respective fill stations locations. The transfer lines were then sterilized for 15 min at &gt; 121.1 °C. The sample valve for V13 was then sterilized for 15 min at &gt; 121.1 °C. Once the sample valve had been sterilized and cooled to less than 60 °C, two 30-mL bulk samples were taken for particle size, pH, aluminum concentration, and sterility.<br>
After the samples were taken, the aluminum phosphate was downloaded to the 50-L drums. Once the download was complete, V13 and the transfer lines underwent a full chemical CIP. All of the 50-L drums were then sampled for aluminum concentration and sterility (however, in practice only first and last drums are sampled for sterility). Magnetic stabilizers were affixed to each drum and the drums were stored in a 2-8 °C chill room.<br>
Example 2 - Assaying the Physical, Chemical, and Functional Characteristics of<br>
AIPO4<br>
Three lots of AIPO4 produced according to the process of Figure 1 and three lots of material produced according to the process of Figure 2 (and Example 1) were analyzed to ensure the material produced by both processes were comparable. The assays used were selected based on the physical, chemical and functional characteristics of AIPO4. These characterization studies were performed in addition to the release testing and all lots met the release criteria for AIPO4. The data from the equivalency studies are summarized as follows:<br>
Particle size analysis: Particle size analysis of bulk adjuvants and the formulated vaccine were performed by laser light scattering on a Malvern particle size analyzer (Mastersizer, Serial 2.15). A suspension of powder in a solvent {e.g., isopropanol) was measured with a low angle laser beam, and the particle size distribution was calculated. The volume median diameter D[v,0.5] is the diameter where 50% of the distribution is above and 50% is below the median. Preferably, two determinations of mean particle size should not differ by more than 5% relative. The shape of the curves in the two determinations should also preferably be the same. D[v,0.9] is the diameter where 90% of the volume distribution is below this value. D[v,0.1] is the diameter where 10% of the volume distribution is below this value. The span is the width of the distribution based on the 10%, 50% and 90% quantile (Span = [D[v,0.9]-D[v,0.1]}/D[v,0.5]). Prior to each measurement, the instrument was standardized by using beads of a known molecular size representing 2 µm and 10 µm. It was determined that the particle sizes of AIPO4 (before and after formulation into Prevnar ) made by both processes were comparable and within the specifications that are listed in Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1 - PARTICLE SIZE<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Protein binding assay: The percent protein bound to AIPO4 was determined by measuring the total protein concentration prior to contact with the aluminum pellet and<br>
after treatment with the aluminum pellet. The protein content in the pellet was measured following resuspension in saline. The average percent binding of the carrier protein CRM197 formulated with AIPO4 from the process of Figure 1 (97.5 ± 0.8) and formulated with AIPO4 from the process of Figure 2 (96.1 ± 1.4) were comparable. The average percent binding of Prevnar® formulated with the AIPO4 from the process of Figure 1 (91.5 ± 1.6) and formulated with AIPO4 from the process of Figure 2 (91.7 ± 1.9) were also comparable.<br>
Nephelometry assay: The vaccine Prevnar® was analyzed for antigenicity by nephelometry using citration as a method to solubilize the aluminum pellet. Based on previous work, it is known that only conjugated polysaccharides bind to aluminum and not free polysaccharides or activated saccharides. The antigenicity associated with the pellet reflects polysaccharide that is conjugated. Nephelometry measurements were conducted with the Beckman Array 360 System using antibodies and raised in rabbits. Binding of individual Prevnar   conjugates to AIPO4 was measured using nephelometry, and the data for material made using the processes of Figures 1 and 2 were found to be comparable.<br>
Zeta potential'electrophoretic mobility: The zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility were determined using a Zetasizer. The zeta potential of AIPO4 from the process of Figure 1 was an average of 4.7 ± 0.2 mV (5.1 ± 0.1, 3.5 ± 0.2 and 5.5 ± 0.2 mV). The zeta potential of AIPO4 from the process of Figure 2 was an average of 3.3 ± 0.3 mV (3.6 ± 0.3, 2.6 ± 0.4, and 3.7 ± 0.1 mV).<br>
Settling time: Settling time was monitored by measuring the change in the optical density over 30 minutes in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV160-IPC) at a wavelength of 645 nm. The settling time/rate (A645/min) of AIPO4 from the process of Figure 1 was 0.024, 0.025 and 0.023. The settling time/rate (A645/min) of AIPO4 from the process of Figure 2 was 0.027, 0.026 and 0.026.<br>
Table 2 compares some of the parameters that are used in the methods of Figures 1 and 2. As shown, the settling time of the aluminum phosphate precipitate was reduced from about 7-10 days to about 2-5 days by increasing the settling temperature from 25 °C to 60 °C. This represents a significant improvement in efficiency. As described in Example 1, aluminum phosphate samples produced by both methods have similar physical, chemical and functional characteristics.<br>

Example 3 - Media Simulation<br>
Media simulation studies were performed on the Media Preparation Skid (MPS) of Example 1 using Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB). These studies demonstrated to a high degree of assurance that the sterilizing operations for the MPS maintained sterility and protected against microbial ingress during the manufacture, pH adjustment, sampling and then transfer of sterile solutions into drums. Each media study trial consisted of sterilizing, sterile adjustment of the pH using 5N sodium hydroxide and sterile transfer of the TSB into sixteen drums. The sterile transfer occurred after a &gt; 10 hour sterile hold. The sterile hold established the total amount of time that the system can be held after the sterilization operations have been performed (11 hours). TSB was collected into a 1L bottle from all sixteen fill station locations and underwent complete incubation. Samples taken from locations #1 and #16 are representative of the entire solution transfer process<br>
into drums. Because of the closed system design of the Media Preparation Skid of Example 1 and the successful results of this study, sterility testing need only be performed on the first and last drums during commercial production, rather than on every drum, as was needed with the method depicted in Figure 1.<br>
