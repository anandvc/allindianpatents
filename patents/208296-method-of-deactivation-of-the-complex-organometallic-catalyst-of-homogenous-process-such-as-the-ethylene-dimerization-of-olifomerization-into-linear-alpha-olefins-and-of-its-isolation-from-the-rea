Complete Description<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention is related to deactivation of complex organometallic catalyst (COC) of homogeneous processes (e.g., dimerization of ethylene into butene-1 or oligomerization of ethylene into linear alpha-olefins C4-C30 (LAO) ) and its subsequent isolation from the reaction mass.<br>
The invention can be applied in chemical and petrochemical industry, i.e., at plants producing butene-1 or LAO by homogeneous catalytic process using COC. Butene-1, the product of ethylene dimerization, is used as a starting  material for synthesis of crystalline polybutene-1, ethylene-butene and propylene-butene plastics (including    linear    low-density    polyethylene)    and    elastomers,    oligobutene    oils, butylaromatic hydrocarbons, butadiene, butene alpha-oxide, alpha- and beta-butanols, methylethylketone, dimers and co-dimers of butene-1 with other monomers, and other products. LAO C4-C30, products of ethylene oligomerization, are used as a starting material   for   production   of   household   detergents,   floating   reagents,   emulsifiers, components of lubricants, coolants and drilling liquids, plasticizers, different types of additives, synthetic low curing oils, polymers and co-polymers, monomers, depressors for petroleum and petroleum products, higher aikylamines, higher aluminumorganic compounds, heat carriers, synthetic fat alcohols and acids, as well as for production of components of different composites based on LAO (C20-C30) - mastics, hermetics, coatings.<br>
In the USA patents 3879485, 3911942, 3969429, British patents 1447811, 1447812, and German patents 2274583, 2462771, a method of ethylene dimerization into butene
According to the inventions described in the USSR inventor's certificates 784172, SU 1042701A, 1148149; Italian unaccepted application 24498 A/79; and German patent DE 4338414 CI,, ethylene oligomerization into LAO C4-C30 is performed in organic solvent at 60-80°C and at ethylene pressure 2.0-4.0 MPa. Toluene, benzene or heptane are used as a reaction medium.<br>
According to these documents, ethylene, oligomerization into LAO is performed using COC containing Zr-salt of an organic acid - ClmZr (OCOR) 4-m or ClmZr (OS03R') 4-m<br><br>
and aluminumorganic compound (AOC) - (C2H5)nAICI3-n, where R and R'- are alkyl,<br>
alkene or phenyl; n smoothly varies from 1 to 2.<br>
In optimum conditions, ethylene di- and oligomerization are homogeneous processes:<br>
no catalyst deposits are formed, and the content of soluble products of ethylene<br>
conversion (in particular polyethylene) is insignificant.<br>
In continuous blending reactors, the reaction mass at the exit of reactor contains a<br>
mixture of a solvent and products of ethylene conversion (butene-1 and LAO for di- and<br>
oligomerization,    respectively),    with    dissolved    nonconverted    ethylene,    catalyst<br>
components, active centers and the products of their spontaneous thermodeactivation.<br>
If di- or oligomerization occurs under the action of living active centers outside the reactor out of control (and, in some , cases, due to throttling), ethylene concentration decreases, temperature drastically increases (or decreases in case*of throttling), and relative concentration of butene-1 or LAO, respectively, increases.<br>
The presence of living active centers, low concentration or absence of ethylene, and relatively high concentration of butene-1 or L.AO in the solution (up to 8 mol/l) cause secondary reactions of butene-1 and LAO, in particular, isomerization of butene-1 into cis- and trans-butenes-2; isomerization of other LAO into olefins with the double bond between intramolecular carbon atoms; concurrent di-, tri- and oligomerization of butene-1 or LAO, their conversion into isoolefins.<br>
Duration of contact of LAO-containing oligomerizate with the ,lliving" catalyst in the absence of ethylene appeared to be the most crucial factor. Table 1 shows that, in the absence of ethylene, LAO R-CH=CH2 oligomerizes under the action of catalyst to form isoolefins. This is confirmed by a decrease in the content of double bonds in the reaction mass and by formation of oily oligomers with the average molecular weight of 350-800. Degree of conversion for olefins with vinyl double bonds increased with increasing duration of LAO contact with the "living" catalyst.<br>
The catalysts contain AOC (C2H5)nAiCI3-n which are strong Lewis acids. In the systems under consideration, cationic active centers easily form on the AOC. These active centers are responsible for isomerisation, di-, tri-t and oligomerization of LAO, as well as alkylation of the aromatic solvent.<br>
Diffusion of water and alcohol traces into the reaction mass containing LAO and the "living" catalyst causes a considerable  heating of the reaction mass  and drastic<br><br>
acceleration of the cationic processes involving LAO. In steady-state conditions, the cationic reactions and heating of the reaction mass occur in a frontal mode.<br>
All the above-mentioned secondary reactions of butene-1 and LAO proceed at high speed.<br>
Apparatuses for ethylene throttling, collectors of the reaction mass, and columns for isolation of narrow fractions of butene-1 and LAO from the reaction mass provide favorable conditions for secondary reactions of butene-1 and LAO under the action of the "living" catalyst.<br>
Butene-1 or LAO secondary reactions are accompanied by consumption of olefins with vinyl double bonds, and by contamination of butene-1 and LAO with the products of their conversion. This decreases selectivity of the catalyst and the process.<br>
Evidently, secondary reactions of butene-1 or LAO are undesirable. To prevent the secondary reactions, it is necessary to deactivate the "living" catalyst immediately after its removal from the reactor.<br>
Methods of deactivation of the catalyst containing ClmZr(OCOisoC3H7)4-m and (C2H5)nAICI3-n by the addition of stoichiometric amount of carboxylic acid are know (US patent 4 486 615, German patent 4 338 415).<br>
The former method (USA patent 4 486 615) is characterized by formation of considerable amount of HCI, which causes intense corrosion of the equipment. Besides, a considerable amount of chemically contaminated waste water forms during isolation of the deactivated catalyst by counterflow water flushing of the oligomerizate.<br>
Zr- and Al- containing products of catalyst deactivation by carboxylic acids according to the latter method (German patent 4 338 415) are isolated from, the reaction mass by passing it through the layer of an adsorbent (silicagel, kaolin, aluminum oxides, zirconium dioxides, sawdust).<br>
In this case, deactivation of the catalyst by alkohols results in formation of considerable amount of HCI, which also causes corrosion of the equipment. Moreover, the process is accompanied by the formation of lange amount of waste water during regeneration of the adsorbent.  Regeneration  of the adsorbent requires complicated technological<br><br>
design because it is performed at 60°C, which restricts the number of appropriate materials for adsorbers.<br>
Methods, in which water-alkali or water-ammonia solutions are used as deactivating systems are similar to the suggested one: (1) Pheldblum V.Sh. Dimerization and disproportionatJon of olefins. Moscow: Khimiya, 1978; (2) Application N 3-220135 of 24.01.1990. Japan; (3) R.Zh.Khim, 1993. 15AI7P. These solutions are also used for isolation of the deactivated catalyst from the oligomerizate. Water-alkali or water-ammonia isolation of the worked-out deactivated catalyst is followed by additional flushing of the oligomerizate with demineralized water.<br>
Alkali and ammonia are intended mainly for neutralization of HCI formed during hydrolysis of Cl-containing products of COC reactions. This method is also accompanied by the formation of considerable amount of chemically contaminated water waste.<br>
On the other hand, slow and inefficient mixing of water- and oleophases in stirrer-equipped apparatuses or in widespread orifice mixers causes formation of cationic active centers, cationic oligomerization of LAO, and toluene alkylation with linear alpha-olefins. In all known methods, deactivation and isolation of the deactivated catalyst is performed in two stages before separation of the oligomerizate into narrow fractions. The aim of this invention is to increase the purity of LAO, that is, to increase the selectivity of the catalyst and the processes of dimerization and oligomerization of ethylene. Another purpose of the invention is to simplify the stage of deactivation and isolation of the catalyst and to eliminate water wastes, thus providing ecological safety.<br>
General Description of the Invention<br>
According to the developed method, THESE PURPOSES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY mixing of the reaction mass with a solution of metal hydroxide in a protic solvent and isolation of the deactivated catalyst from the organic phase in one stage at 60-100°C and ethylene pressure of 2-4 MPa.<br>
This temperature range is chosen because the deactivation of "living" catalyst, as well as di- and oligomerization proceed under the similar conditions.<br>
According to the invention, deactivation of the catalyst by a solution of metal hydroxide in protic solvent is weakly sensitive to temperature: deactivation rate and selectivity with respect to U\0 are almost independent from temperature.  However,  an elevated<br><br>
ethylene pressure is required in oder to improve the selectivity of the process with respect to LAO.<br>
The chosen ethylene pressure range (2-4 MPa) ensures high selectivity and high rate of COC deactivation.<br>
Deactivation rate and selectivity with respect to LAO are strongly dependent on the<br>
efficiency of mixing. Therefore, meanical mixing is combined with ultrasonic treatment<br>
of the mixture of metal-hydroxide solution with organic phase in the protic solvent using<br>
a three-dimensional grid with a magnetostrictor placed in the mixer and connected to a<br>
UZG-2.5 ultrasound generator. The ultrasonic treatment ensures sharp increase in<br>
dispersion   of   liquid   droplets   up   to   complete   homogenization   of   the   mixture<br>
(N.N. Kruglitzkii et al, "Ultrasound in chemical technology",  Kiev. UKRNI1TY,  1970;<br>
Collection of papers 'Thermal and salt stability of dispersed systems", Kiev. Naukova<br>
Dumka, 1971). More efficient mixing and high stability of the resultant dispersed mixture<br>
of oligomerizate and water-alkali solution provide higher rate of catalyst deactivation<br>
and improved selectivity of the process.<br>
The protic solvent is subsequently isolated from the reaction mass by rectification and<br>
adsorptive purification, while deactivated catalyst remains in the organic phase. The<br>
isolated protic solvent is fed back for preparation of the alkali solution. This prevents<br>
waste formation, thus providing ecological safety of the process.<br>
Water, alcohol or ammonia are usually used as the protic solvent for preparation of the<br>
alkali solutions for COC deactivation.<br>
Alkali content varies from 1 to 40 wt %, preferably, from 5 to 10 wt %.<br>
Hydroxides chosen from a group of lithium, sodium, potassium, beryllium, magnesium,<br>
calcium, ammonia or aluminum hydroxides are used as alkalies. The latter is water<br>
insoluble, and, therefore, is used in the form of suspension.<br>
In spite of great efforts to study reactions between the COC components during<br>
ethylene di- or oligomerization and in model conditions, the composition of the products<br>
is still unknown. Thus, mechanism of catalyst deactivation cannot be exactly described.<br>
The available data allow us to suggest tentative mechanism of the process.<br>

Comparison of these diagrams shows that the suggested method is characterized by<br>
less complicated technological design and is free of waste water. It requires 10 times<br>
less amount of alkalihydroxide solutions for deactivation. Furthermore, no need in<br>
demineralized  water (for oligomerizate  flushing)  and  gaseous  carbonic  acid  for<br>
neutralization of wastes. These are very important advantages of the method.<br>
The method under patenting can be used in homogeneous di- or oligomenzat.on,<br>
metathesis   telomerization, hydrogenation, alkylation using soluble COC conta.n.ng<br>
titanium zirconium, hafnium, nickel, molibdenum, tungsten and other transition metals.<br><br>
Detailed   Description<br>
The active center of ethylene oligomerization is known to involve Zr-organic compound, which contains sigma Zr-carbon bond, for example,-&gt;Zr-CH2-CH3. Alcohol, water, or ammonia-alkali deactivation of "living" COC is accompanied by alcoholysis or hydrolysis of these bonds:<br>
~&gt;Zr-CH2-CH3 + H20 -— &gt; -&gt;Zr-OH + C2H6<br>
Since there are only few active centers in COC, the deactivating agent will be consumed predominantly in reactions with COC components. Let us consider a probale mechanism of water-alkali deactivation of COC which involves Zr (OCOisoC3H7)4 and (C2H5)1.5AICI1.5 (Al/Zr = 13). Taking into account the results of model experiments on hydrolysis of the components in toluene, it can be tentatively described as follows:<br>
Zr (OCOisoC3H7) 4	+ 4NaOH       — &gt;	Zr(OH)4	+	4Na0C0isoC3H7<br>
13(C2H5)1.5AICI1.5+	19.5H20         —&gt;	19.5C2H6	+	13(H0)1.5AICI1.5<br>
13(H0)1.5AICI1.5	+  19.5NaOH ---&gt;	13AI(OH)3	+	19.SNaCI<br>
13AI(OH)3	+  13NaOH     —&gt;	13NaAI02	+	26H20<br>
By summarizing left and right parts of these equations, we obtain the following overall reaction:<br>
Zr(OCOisoC3H7)4   +	13(C2H5)1.5AICI1.5+	36.5NaOH     —&gt;<br>
Zr(OH)4	+	4NaOCOisoC3H7    +	19.5C2H6     +	19.5NaCI       +<br>
+	13NaAI02     +	6.5H20<br>
This equation shows stoichiometry of the reactions occuring in the deactivator. Sodium hydroxide is the main deactivating agent. To ensure complete deactivation, it is reasonable to use a 10-20 % over-stoichiometric amount of sodiurrvhydroxide. Water is not consumed during the COC deactivation; therefore, minimum amount of water is required to dissolve sodium hydroxide. This allows to reduce engergy consumption for desiccation of the reaction mass.<br>
After isolation of the protic solvent, the oleophase contains hydrocarbon-insoluble sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, sodium aluminate, sodium zirconate, aluminum and zirconium hydroxychlorides, aluminum and zirconium hydroxides, alumina, zirconia, and sodium isobutyrate in the form of highly dispersed suspension. They can be isolated either by filtration and inertial-gravity sedimentation before separation of the oleophase into narrow fractions or after its separation by atmospheric-vacuum distillation in several columns at 60-300X.<br><br>
Studies under model and operating conditions show that LAO are stable in a range of 60-300cC even in the presence of products of alcohol, water or ammonia-alkali COC deactivation. This provides the background of our approach.<br>
During atmospheric-vacuum distillation of the oleophase, concentration of the deactivated catalyst (in the form of suspension) gradually increases by a factor of 10-to-20. After completion of distillation, the deactivated catalyst together with polyethylene traces and waxy LAO get into the bottoms.<br>
According to the invention, the products of deactivation of the worked-out catalyst are separated by extraction. Waxy olefins from the bottoms are extracted by hydrocarbon low-boiling solvent choosen from the group: hexane, heptane, gasoline, benzene, toluene, butene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, while the products of the catalyst deactivation are flushed with the same solvent and delivered in the form of suspension into settling tank, filter or centrifuge, where they are separated from the hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
For economical reasons, the solvent used or formed during oligomerization can be used as the extractant. Among the abovementioned solvents, toluene exhibits the best extracting ability with respect to waxy LAO.<br>
Then, the isolated insoluble products of catalyst deactivation are calcined (high-temperature oxidative mineralization) in a spray (flame) drying chamber. Calcining is followed by recovery of sodium, aluminum, and zirconium. In particular, recovery of Zr by a metallurgical technique is reasonable to perform when its content in a dry slime is above 3 wt %, as in the described method of catalyst deactivation. _<br>
The extract together with flushing hydrocarbon solution are subjected to distillation in order to isolate waxy LAO. The hydrocarbon solvent is recycled for extraction of waxy LAO from the bottoms, while waxy LAO are fed for utilization or storage.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
1.1 Ethylene oligomerization was performed on Zr(OCOisoC3H7)4 (0.382 mmol) (0.0348 g of Zr) + (C2H5)1.5AICI1.5 (Al/Zr = 13) system in toluene (0.25 I) at 80°C and ethylene pressure of 2.0 MPa for 60 min. 187.5 g of ethylene was consumed and about 250 ml of LAO was formed.<br>
1.2.	The catalyst deactivation in the oligomerizate (about 500 ml) was performed with water-alkali solution containing 15 ml of water and 3.4 g of sodium hydroxide (18.5 wt %) in the reactor, under the above-mentioned conditions, with intense stirring of the oligomerizate and deactivating solution for 20 min, using the shielded electromagnetic stirrer and the ultrasonic generator in the bottom of the reactor. 20 minutes after loading of alkali water solution into reactor, the oligomerizate was sampled for various analyses. The reaction mass cooled to 20-25°C, and ethylene throttling was carried out. During throttling, almost total amount of the formed butene-1 was removed from the reactor together with ethylene. Then the reaction mass was discharged from the reactor. No stratification of the reaction mass into oleo- and water phases was observed.<br>
1.3.	The obtained reaction mass (about 500 ml) containing the products of the catalyst deactivation was charged into the still of the highly efficient column for the atmospheric-vacuum distillation of the oligomerizate. Initially, azeotropic desiccation of the oligomerizate was performed at 60-700°C. 14.2 ml of water was taken from the Florentine, which is about 94.6 wt % of starting amount of water loaded in the reactor.<br>
1.4.	After drying, hexene-1, toluene, octene-1, decene-1 and C12-C18 LAO-fractions<br>
were isolated from the oligomerizate. After completion of distillation, 30 g of hot<br>
milky-white homogeneous bottoms was unloaded from the column still. The<br>
isolated bottoms contained waxy LAO, Zr-,, Al-containing compounds, sooium<br>
chloride and sodium -i-sobutyrate.<br><br>
1.5.	The bottoms (about 30 g) was charged in the glass reactor with thermostating jacket equipped with spiral-shaped power-driven stirrer. 280 ml of toluene was charged there. After mixing the mass at 80°C for 20 minutes, a solution of waxy LAO and suspension of the catalyst deactivation products yielded. A deposit after settling was separated from the waxy LAO solution by decanting. Then 100 ml of fresh toluene was added to the deposit. The resulting suspension was stirred for 20 minutes under the same conditions. The deposit was separated from the flushing solution on the centrifuge, the centrifugate obtained was united with the LAO toluene solution separated formerly.<br>
1.6.	The products of the catalyst deactivation were dried in a desiccator in air media at 300°C for 60 minutes. 3.82 g of the precipitate was obtained. To perform Zr analysis, 0.0111 g of the precipitate was sampled and dissolved in 3 ml of the standard analytical solution. Calorimetry method showed that 0.0111 g of the precipitate contain 95-10'6 of Zr, that is, 3.82 g of the precipitate contain 0.0327 g of Zr (94 mas% with respect to the stalling Zr(0.0348 g) which was loaded in the reactor as Zr(OCOisoC3H7)^). Zr Loss is 6 mas%, due to high adhesion of Zr hydroxide, which sticks to the reactors, flasks and pipettes walls.<br>
Analysis of Al and CI show that the precipitate contains 0.13 g of Al (97.2 mas% with respect to the starting Al (0.1342 g) which was introduced in the reactor as (CiHsJi.sAlClj.s) and 0.253 g of chlorine (95.6 mas% with respect to the starting chlorine (0.266 g) loaded in the reactor as (C2HS),.5A1CI,.5.<br>
1.7.	The united solution of waxy LAO in toluene (about 370 ml) was loaded in the still of atmospheric-vacuum rectification column, and toluene was almost completely distilled off at 111°C and ambient pressure. The rest of toluene from waxy olefins was distilled off in vacuum, using a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen. Totally, 361 ml (95%) of toluene was distilled off. 24.1 g of waxy LAO was unloaded from the still (about 12.85 mass% with respect to the ethylene consumed during oligomerization).<br>
1.8.	Table 2 presents the LAO group composition, which were isolated from oligomerizate obtained while deactivating the catalyst under ultrasound irradiation of the mixed liquids and in reference conditions (without ultrasound irradiation). The Table shows that ultrasound irradiation of the mixed oligomerizate and sodium hydroxide water solution increases the catalyst and the process selectivity. This is confirmed by reduction of olefins with vinylene and vinylidene double bonds content in LAO fractions, and by complete absence of alkylation.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
2.1. Ethylene dimerization was performed on Ti(OnC.,H9).rAl(C2Hs)3 system in diethyl ether. 0.2 1 of diethyl ether, 0.1875 g (0.55 inmol) of titanium tetrabutoxide and 3.11 g (27.2S mmol) of triethylaluminum (Al/Ti= 49.6) were loaded in the reactor of 1.1. 1 volume. 435 g (7.76S mol) of ethylene was consumed during 250 minutes at 40°C and ethylene pressure of 8.0 atm. Average speed of dimerization was 8.5 g of C2H./l-min (0.52 kg of C4Hs/l hour). Butene-1 yield is 2.32 kg/g of Ti(OnC4H9)j or 14100 mol of butene-1 with respect to a mol of Ti(OnC4H9)4. There were no cis- and trans-butenes-2, as well as polyethylene, in the products. In addition to butene-1. 9.1 g of hexenes and octenes (2.1 mas% with respect to butene-1) was formed.<br>
2.2 Deactivation of the catalyst was performed in the reaction mass (about 900 ml) with water-alkali solution containing 15 ml of water and 0.15 g (3.75 mmol) of sodium hydroxide (0.99 mas% with respect to water), in the reactor under the same conditions, with intense stirring of the reaction mass with the shielded electromagnetic stirrer and the equipment for irradiation of the resulting mixture with ultrasound, installed in the bottom of the reactor, during 20 minutes. 20 minutes after loading of alkali water solution into the reactor, gas phase was sampled for chromatography.<br>
2.3.	The reaction mass containing diethyl ether, butene-1, hexenes and octenes, water and<br>
products of the catalyst decomposition, was transferred by the ethylene pressure, available in the<br>
reactor, into the still of metallic reaction column equipped with dephlegmator and florentine vessel.<br>
First, ethylene throttling was carried out at 20-30°C, then - azeotropic desiccation of the reaction<br>
mass at 0-5°C. 11.0 ml of water was removed from the Florentine, that is 73.3 mas% with respect<br>
to the loaded water.<br>
2.4.	Then butene-1, diethyl ether and hexenes were isolated. After distillation was<br>
completed, bottoms containing octenes, a small amount of the unknown resin-like product and<br>
products of the catalyst deactivation (supposedly, Ti, Al, and Na hydroxides, as well as sodium<br>
aluminates) were left in the column still.<br><br>
2.5.	100 nil of n-heptane wns charged in the column slill. After the mixture was being<br>
mixed at 200° C for 20 minutes with a flexible stirrer which was introduced in the slill through the<br>
side sleeve, a solution of resin-like products and a suspension of products of the catalyst<br>
deactivation were formed. The deposit and the solution were unloaded into the glass. The<br>
hydrocarbon layer was separated by decanting, and the precipitate was flushed with 40 mi of n-<br>
heptane. The precipitate was separated from the flushing solution on the centrifuge, the centrifugate<br>
was joined to the foimerly separated n-heptane solution.<br>
2.6.	The products of the catalyst deactivation were dried and calcined in a muffle at 600°C in air during 60 minutes. 1.53 g of the deposit was obtained, which contained 0.0246 g of Ti (92.8 mas% with respect to Ti loaded as TiCOnC^H.)^), and 0.70 g of Al (95.1 mas% with respect to Al loaded in the reactor as AJ(C&gt;Hs)3).<br>
2.7.	The united n-heptane solution (about 130 ml) was loaded in the still of off at 98° and ambient pressure. The rest of n-heptane was distilled off in vacuum using a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen. Totally, 128 ml (91.4%) of n-heptane was distilled off. 1.1 g of hot oily substance was removed from the still (0.25 mas% with respect to the consumed ethylene).<br>
Example 3 - 14:<br>
The reagents and ethylene to LAO oligomerization conditions were the same as in Example 1. The catalyst in the oligomerizate was deactivated with water, alcohol, and ammonia alkali solutions just in the reactor, with mechanical stirring of the mixing solutions, with additional solution homogenization using ultrasound similar to Example 1.<br>
In Examples 3-14 the solvent for alkali, origin and concentration of alkali were changed (Table 3). The subsequent steps of the reaction mass separation into fractions, isolation and treatment of products of the catalyst (Zr(OCOisoC3H7)4-(C2H5)i.5AlCli.5 deactivation were similar to ones in Example 1. Table 3 presents a degree of Zr, Al and CI isolation with respect to loading of these elements as the catalyst components. Though more water was expended, magnesium, calcium and beryllium hydroxides were not totally dissolved, and Al hydroxide was completely<br><br>
