fiber materials<br>
The present invention relates to the field of reactive dyes and concerns<br>
processes for mono-, di- or trichromatic dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic<br>
10 polyamide fiber materials and dye mixtures which are useful for these processes.<br>
EP 1 275 700 A2 describes a process for trichromatic dyeing and printing of<br>
synthetic polyamide fiber materials which is characterized in that it utilizes a red-<br>

The process of the present invention can be implemented using the customary<br>
dyeing and printing processes described in the literature and known to one<br>
skilled in the art (see for example H.-K. Rouette, Handbuch der Textilveredelung,<br>
Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH, Frankfurt am Main).<br>
The dyeing liquors and print pastes may contain further additives as well as the<br>
dyes of the general formulae (I) to (IX) and water. Additives are for example<br>
wetting agents, antifoams, leveling agents and agents which influence the<br>
properties of the textile material, such as softeners, flame retardants and soil,<br>
water and oil-repellent or water-softening agents. Especially print pastes may<br>
also comprise natural or synthetic thickeners, for example alginates and cellulose<br>
ethers.<br>
The dye quantities in the dyebaths and print pastes can vary within wide limits,<br>
depending on the desired depth of shade. The amounts in which the dyes of the<br>
general formulae (I) to (IX) are present range in general from 0.01 % to 15% by<br>
weight each and especially from 0.1 % to 10% by weight each, based on weight<br>
of fiber and the print paste respectively.<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably a dyeing process which is<br>
carried out by the exhaust method in particular. The dyeing pH is preferably in<br>
11<br>
the range from 3 to 7 and especially in the range from 4 to 6. The liquor ratio<br>
can be within wide limits and is for example between 1:5 and 1:50 and<br>
preferably between 1:5 and 1:30. The dyeing temperature is preferably in the<br>
range from 70 to 110°C and especially in the range from 80 to 105°C.<br>
To enhance the wetfastnesses of the dyed material, unfixed dye can be removed<br>
in an aftertreatment. This aftertreatment is carried out in particular at a pH from<br>
8 to 9 and temperatures of for example 75 to 85 °C.<br>
The process of the present invention, whether it is carried out as a dyeing<br>
process or as a printing process, is notable for uniform color buildup, good<br>
exhaustion and fixing performance and good hue consistency on the part of the<br>
dyes of the general formulae (I) to (IX). A particular advantage is the<br>
compatibility of the dyes mentioned, which is very good. The dyeings and prints<br>
obtained are also notable for good fastnesses, especially good rub-, wet-,<br>
wetrub- and lightfastnesses.<br>
The process of the present invention is useful for dyeing and printing natural and<br>
synthetic polyamide fiber materials. Natural polyamide fiber material chiefly<br>
refers to wool, and here the process of the present invention is especially useful<br>
for machine-washable wool. Synthetic polyamide fiber materials are for example<br>
those composed of nylon-6 or nylon-6,6.<br>
The polyamide fiber materials mentioned can be present in a wide range of<br>
processing forms, for example as fiber, yarn, woven fabric or formed-loop<br>
knitted fabric, but especially in the form of carpets.<br>
Dye mixtures a), b) and c), utilized in the process of the present invention, are<br>
novel and likewise form part of the subject matter of the present invention.<br>

electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions is preferably below 10% by<br>

The present invention also provides processes for preparing the dye mixtures of<br>
the present invention.<br>
These dye mixtures of the present invention are obtainable for example by<br>
mechanically mixing the individual dyes in the desired ratio. The individual dyes<br>
required for this purpose are known or can be prepared by known processes.<br>
Alternatively, the dye mixtures of the present invention can be prepared by<br>
chemical synthesis. This is done for example by diazotizing a mixture of diazo<br>
components in the desired ratio and then coupling onto a coupling component. If<br>
desired, further dyes can be added to the resulting reaction solution in the<br>
desired ratio. The necessary diazotization and coupling reactions are known and<br>
form part of the tool kit of a person skilled in the art.<br>
For example, a red-dyeing dye mixture according to the present invention can be<br>
prepared by a mixture of a diazo component of the general formula (X)<br>
and of a diazo component of the general formula (XI)<br>
where R5, R6, Y2 and Y3 are as defined above, being conjointly diazotized and<br>
coupled onto the coupling component of the formula (XII)<br>
where M is as defined above.<br>
This reaction provides a dye mixture of the dyes of the general formulae (III) and<br>
(IV) which is in accordance with the present invention. When this dye mixture<br>
shall additionally comprise a dye of the general formula (VIII) it can be added to<br>
the as-coupled reaction solution in the desired ratio.<br><br>
A yellow-dyeing dye mixture according to the present invention can be prepared<br>
for example by a mixture of a diazo component of the general formula (XIII)<br>
and of a diazo component of the general formula (XIV)<br>
D1 -NH2 (XIV)<br>
where M and D1 are as defined above, being conjointly diazotized and coupled<br>
onto the coupling component of the general formula (XV)<br>
where R7, R8 and Y4 are as defined above.<br>
This reaction provides a dye mixture of the dyes of the general formulae (V) and<br>
(VI) which is in accordance with the present invention. When this dye mixture<br>
shall additionally comprise a dye of the general formula (IX) it can be added to<br>
the as-coupled reaction solution in the desired ratio.<br>
Finally, the preparation of a blue-dyeing dye mixture according to the present<br>
invention is accomplished for example by reacting a compound of the general<br>
formula (XVI)<br>
where B1 and M are as defined above, with 1,3,5-trichlorotriazine in a<br>
conventional manner to form a compound of the general formula (XVII)<br>
and further in a conventional manner reacting with a mixture in the desired<br>
mixing ratio of the compounds of the general formulae (XVIII) and (XIX)<br>
where V1 and V2 are as defined above.<br>
This reaction provides a dye mixture of the dyes of the general formulae (I) and<br>
22<br>
(II) which is in accordance with the present invention. When this dye mixture<br>
shall further comprise a dye of the general formula (VII), it can be added in the<br>
desired ratio to the reaction solution obtained in the course of the reaction with<br>
the compounds of the general formulae (XVIII) and (XIX).<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (X) to (XIX) that are needed to prepare<br>
dye mixtures according to the present invention are known or preparable by<br>
known processes.<br>
