Molded Plastic Body and Method for Producing the Same<br>
The invention relates to a molded plastic body according to the preamble of claim 1 and a<br>
method for producing a molded plastic body according to the preamble of the independent claim.<br>
Generic molded bodies are used for example in the kitchen and bathroom, in particular as<br>
sinks, working surfaces, shower trays or the like. In these applications it is especially important that<br>
the molded bodies can be easily and thoroughly cleaned, and have high resistivity to mechanical and<br>
thermal loads and especially to cyclic thermal loads in conjunction with water or water vapor.<br>
DE 38 32 351 Al discloses molded plastic bodies according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Matched to the mass of the monomer in the binder solution, in the prior art a so-called crosslinking<br>
agent is added which causes three-dimensional crosslinking of the polymer chains among one<br>
another and thus increases the hardness and solvent resistance of the molded body which has been<br>
produced. The upper limit of the proportion of crosslinking agent is approximately 4% by weight<br>
relative to the monomer proportion.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
2<br>
A higher proportion of the crosslinking agent, depending on the particle size of the inorganic<br>
particulate filler, leads to different results which are however undesirable. If for example the<br>
proportion of crosslinking agent is increased when using a filler with a very small particle size, this<br>
leads to the molded bodies tearing in the course of shaping polymerization. For coarser fillers<br>
conversely an increase of the proportion of crosslinking agent leads to much more visible, in<br>
particular white regions on the surface or directly under the surface, with a distribution which is<br>
moreover irregular, and the associated molded body does not meet the quality requirements imposed<br>
on appearance.<br>
DE 199 49 461 Al discloses a curable casting mass which contains a proportion of 2.5% by<br>
weight of the crosslinking agent (relative to the monomer content of the binder solution) in the<br>
binder solution formed from the monomer (MMA) and polymer (PMMA). Tn some of the described<br>
embodiments another crosslinking agent which is different from the crosslinking agent in the binder<br>
solution is not added to the binder solution, but to a dye pigment dispersion. The molded parts<br>
produced accordingly do not have the properties which can be achieved by this invention, especially<br>
with respect to attainable smoothness of the surface and the outstanding cleanability which can be<br>
achieved thereby.<br>
DE 195 21 638 Al discloses a process for producing highly-filled plastics with a sparkle<br>
effect, with a filler suspension with a content of crosslinking monomers given at preferably 0.1 to<br>
5% by weight relative to the monomer content.<br>
JP 09 067497 A and JP 63 068655 A likewise disclose reaction mixtures which contain<br>
crosslinking agents and which however also are not castable in the uncured state.<br>
The object of the invention is to make available a generic molded plastic body and the<br>
pertinent production process which overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. In particular the<br>
molded body should have good usage properties, especially good care properties and high resistance<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
3<br>
to mechanical and thermal loads, and high visual quality. The pertinent production process should<br>
easily and economically yield molded bodies of high mechanical and visual quality.<br>
This object is achieved by the molded body defined in claim 1 and by the production<br>
process defined in the independent claim. Special embodiments of the invention are defined in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
In a molded plastic body which is produced from a cured reaction mixture, the castable<br>
reaction mixture in the uncured state having an inorganic particulate filler with a portion of 50 to<br>
90% by weight relative to the reaction mixture, a crosslinking agent, and a binder solution with a<br>
proportion from 10 to 50% by weight relative to the reaction mixture, the binder solution having a<br>
monomer and a polymer dissolved therein, the object is achieved in that the proportion of the<br>
crosslinking agent is more than 10% by weight relative to the proportion of the monomer in the<br>
binder solution. The molded body is produced preferably in a casting mold.<br>
It is quite surprising that on the basis of aproportion of the crosslinking agent of<br>
approximately 3% by weight relative to the monomer portion, upon an increase especially the visual<br>
properties of the molded bodies produced are first degraded in order to again distinctly improve<br>
when the proportion is increased further. Especially for an increase beyond 10% by weight, molded<br>
bodies are surprisingly obtained which with respect to wear resistance, scratch resistance and ease<br>
of cleaning combine an optimum of these properties. According to the invention a uniform<br>
distribution of small polymer regions is achieved which no longer exhibit the negative properties of<br>
spot formation and still adequately stabilize the molded body which has been produced in order to<br>
prevent tearing during and after forming. Moreover a closed surface is formed which in addition<br>
also combines haptically distinct advantages over molded bodies from the prior art and a resistant<br>
surface with high visual appeal. The surface has improved resistance to falling objects and/or higher<br>
scratch resistance, and is also more resistant to hot surfaces.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
4<br>
The attainable usage properties also depend on the grain size of the filler used. Fillers with a<br>
grain size less than 0.05 mm can be referred to as fine fillers for many applications. When using<br>
these fine fillers the surface is generally smooth and can be especially easily cleaned. However the<br>
visibility of scratches is increased, in a hot pot test dulling can occur and the abrasion resistance is<br>
less compared to molded bodies with coarser fillers. When using coarser filler there is conversely<br>
generally higher resistivity to mechanical and thermal stresses, but brightening in hot/cold cycle test<br>
and in the water vapor test can occur, for example under the action of hot water. Moreover<br>
roughened areas can occur in the region of the sink bottom. Ease of cleaning of molded bodies<br>
produced in this way is generally less. Nor does a combination of fine and coarse fillers lead directly<br>
to an optimum result.<br>
Both for fine and also coarse fillers however a further improvement of usage properties can<br>
be achieved when the proportion of the crosslinldng agent is more than 10% by weight, preferably<br>
more than 20 and in particular between 20 and 30% by weight, each relative to the proportion of<br>
monomer in the binder solution. Preferably a crosslinking agent is used which polymerizes more<br>
quickly than the other polymerizable binder solution. In this way an especially hard surface with<br>
correspondingly good usage properties is produced. The crosslinking agent is preferably a<br>
bifunctional or multifunctional monomer or polymer, in particular a bifunctional or multifunctional<br>
acrylatc or methacrylate, such as for example ethylene glycol dimethacrylate or trimei:hylolpropane<br>
trimethacrylate. Another possible crosslinking agent is pentaerythritol triacrylate or pentaerythritol<br>
tetraacrylate or glycerin dimethacrylate. Research has shown that the crosslinking agent bisphenol-<br>
A-ethoxylate(2)dimethacrylate in spite of a proportion of binder solution which is high according to<br>
the invention does not deliver the desired results, for which reason in one preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention this crosslinking agent is not suited, but other crosslinldng agents are preferred, in<br>
particular trimethylol propane trimethacrylate or one of the aforementioned crosslinking agents. It<br>
can also be advantageous to use a combination of two or more such crosslinking agents. The<br>
overall designation acrylate can thus comprise both acrylates and also methacrylates.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
5<br>
The proportion of the binder solution is between 10 and 45%, in particular between 15 and<br>
40%, and preferably between 20 and 35% by weight, each relative to the reaction mixture. At these<br>
percentages the crosslinking agent with its proportion which is high according to the invention is not<br>
attributed to the binder solution. Monomers can be in particular styrene, acrylic acid or methacrylic<br>
acid or its esters. In one special embodiment the binder solution has a mixture of methyl<br>
methacrylate and polymethyl methacrylate, or a mixture of methyl methacrylate and a polymer, in<br>
particular a mixture of methyl methacrylate and a homopolymer or copolymer of methyl<br>
methacrylate, the copolymer preferably containing the comonomer ethylmethacrylate or butyl<br>
methacrylate.<br>
The ratio of the proportions by weight of the polymer to the monomer in the binder solution<br>
is between 1:1 and 1:10, in particular between 1:2 and 1:7 and preferably between 1:3 and 1:5. As a<br>
rule, the size of the filler particles used and the required proportion of the binder solution in<br>
particular interact with one another such that when the proportion is increased coarser filler particles<br>
of the proportion of binder solution tend to be able to be reduced.<br>
The proportion of particulate inorganic filler is preferably between 55 and 85% by weight,<br>
in particular between 60 and 80% by weight and preferably between 65 and 75% by weight, each<br>
relative to the reaction mixture. In this case it is preferably a mineral inorganic filler, in particular a<br>
crystalline filler such as for example silica sand.<br>
Preferably the filler particles have a Mohs hardness of more than 5, in particular more than 6<br>
and preferably approximately 7. This applies in any case to the overwhelming proportion of the<br>
filler particles used. For technical and economic reasons the use of silicon dioxide with a Mohs<br>
hardness of approximately 7 is preferred. Alternatively or in addition also other and in particular<br>
harder filler particles can be used which are obtained naturally or synthetically. Examples here<br>
include the corresponding glass, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, or carbon in the diamond<br>
modification.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT7EP2005/011627<br>
6<br>
With respect to the hard layer near the surface, due to the high proportion of crosslinking<br>
agent comparatively soft fillers with a Mohs hardness of less than 5 are possible, especially those<br>
with a Mohs hardness of 3 to 4, such as for example calcium carbonate or the like.<br>
Preferably use is made of naturally obtained silica sands. Especially those silica sands are<br>
advantageous which are of high chemical purity, in particular with a low content of iron oxide, and<br>
moreover which occur with a very narrow particle size range, for example between 0.05 and 0.3<br>
mm, with a predominant mass proportion between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm. These silica sands are<br>
offered for example by the DORFNER company under the trade name GEBA, see<br>
http://wvvw.dorfher.de. The reaction mixture cures with unswollen filler particles and in the uncured<br>
state cannot be cast, so that all the crosslinking agent which has been added to the binder solution is<br>
available for crosslinking of the binder solution.<br>
Preferably the reaction mixture moreover has a substance which prevents settling of filler<br>
particles, in particular a thixotroping agent. In this way warping of the polymerized molded body<br>
will be prevented. The proportion of the substance which prevents settling of filler particles is less<br>
than 1% by weight, relative to the reaction mixture, in particular less than 0.5% by weight, and<br>
preferably approximately 0.15% by weight.<br>
fn one special embodiment of the invention the reaction mixture moreover has dye<br>
pigments. In particular the ease of cleaning of the molded bodies can thus be improved for example<br>
in that in the entry areas of public buildings due to the coloring of the molded bodies dirt is not<br>
overly conspicuous. Conversely, in areas with increased hygiene requirements, such as for example<br>
hospitals or swimming pools, dirt can be clearly visible due to the coloring of the molded plastic<br>
bodies.<br>
The dye pigments can be uniformly or unevenly distributed depending on the application.<br>
The dye pigments can also be prepared in a dye pigment dispersion which is later added to the<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
binder solution and mixed with it. In one embodiment of the invention the dye pigment dispersion<br>
does not contain any crosslinking agent, but the entire crosslinking agent is added to the binder<br>
solution as long as it does not contain any dye pigments or in any event as long as it is not mixed<br>
with a dye pigment dispersion. In addition to inorganic dye pigments, also organically based dye<br>
pigments can be used, for example also an additional filler material in particle form with a size up to<br>
a few millimeters which is formed by polymerization with other included inorganic filler particles.<br>
Moreover by adding dye pigments it is possible to assign signal effects to the molded plastic bodies<br>
which have been produced, for example molded plastic bodies that are colored as required, such as<br>
for example tiles, in commercial areas can mark stop lines, walkways and driveways or the like, or<br>
also a floor area with increased slip resistance can be delineated from a bordering floor area with<br>
normal slip resistance in a recognizable manner.<br>
Preferably the filler particles after polymerization on the surface of the usage side are coated<br>
with a closed layer of polymerized mass. This improves especially the cleanability.<br>
Studies of molded plastic bodies produced according to the invention have shown that a<br>
high proportion of crosslinking agent in the binder solution does not effect shrinkage of the binder<br>
matrix away from casting mold surface, but that rather the casting'mold surface is perfectly<br>
reproduced by the produced molded body. The surface roughness which can be ascertained on the<br>
produced molded body corresponds to the surface roughness of the casting mold surface and can be<br>
set exactly, for example by working the casting mold surface in a specific manner in order to<br>
prepare the surface topography desired on the molded body. In one embodiment the casting mold<br>
surface is provided with a defined surface structure. The casting mold surface is shaped exactly. The<br>
differences in contour of the casting mold surface along a curved path and the contour of the molded<br>
body along the corresponding curved path are less than 5 μm, in particular less than 2 μm, and<br>
preferably less than 1 μm.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/0J1627<br>
8<br>
The high proportion of the crosslinking agent in the binder solution on the surface of the<br>
molded body does not cause the protrusion of filler particles near the surface which is known in the<br>
prior art and which is to some extent even required with respect to the desired hardness by the<br>
shrinking back of the surrounding binder matrix which leads to a surface topography, but the<br>
reaction mixture is tensioned in the cured state over the filler particles near the surface and thus<br>
results in the extremely smooth surface. Thus for example for the molded bodies according to the<br>
invention, on a section between two filler particles near the surface, aside from topographies of the<br>
casting mold surface, at the filler content according to the invention, as is described for example in<br>
the embodiment of formulation 3 explained below, the maximum "height difference" is less than 5<br>
urn, in particular less than 3 urn and preferably less than 2 μrn, in particular less than 1% of the<br>
length of the section.<br>
The high degree of crosslinking is also confirmed by the low swelling, especially of the<br>
layers of the produced molded body near the surface. Thus in a swelling test according to accepted<br>
practice in polymer chemistry, especially when embedded in methyl methacrylate at atmospheric<br>
pressure and room temperature for an interval of 20 hours with the visible side layer of the molded<br>
plastic bodies according to the invention only a volumetric increase of less than 10% occurs, relative<br>
to the initial volume, while in molded bodies from the prior art the volumetric increase under the<br>
same conditions is generally more than 20%. The measurement of the volume increase for highly<br>
filled materials, as in this case, yields greater relative increases compared to measurement of the<br>
mass increase.<br>
By preference glossy particles which induce a metallic gloss in the produced molded bodies<br>
are added to the reaction mixture. In this connection in particular glossy particles are used which do<br>
not have their own color, but for example due to coatings and the interference which occur thereby<br>
cause color phenomena for the viewer. This is associated not only with outstanding visual<br>
appearance, but also usage properties are improved. Suitably coated mica flakes are especially<br>
preferred with respect to the layer material and/or layer thickness.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	'	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
9<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing a molded plastic body as described<br>
above, the process being characterized in that more than 10% by weight of a crosslinking agent<br>
relative to the proportion of the monomer in the binder solution are added to the not yet cured<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
By preference the mold is filled with the reaction mixture as a dispersion and then the<br>
polymerization process is started from the mold part which forms the usage side. Starting takes<br>
place conventionally by heating up the pertinent mold part. The reaction mixture is polymerized<br>
proceeding from the usage side to the opposite side of the molded body to be produced. Preferably<br>
the mold part which forms the usage side is located underneath, but also any other configuration of<br>
the mold part which forms the usage side would lead to the effect according to the invention.<br>
By choosing the particle size and the proportion of filler particles in conjunction with the<br>
proportion of the bifunctional or multifunctional monomer or polymer, settling of the filler particles<br>
caused by gravitation is largely avoided. Unnecessary, a specific proportion of a substance which<br>
prevents settling of the filler particles, in particular a thixotropy agent, is added.<br>
The crosslinking agent is preferable mixed with the binder solution directly and is uniformly<br>
distributed in it. Curing of the reaction mixture by polymerization of the binder solution takes place<br>
preferably in a mold, and especially in the production of three-dimensional molded bodies it can be<br>
a closed mold. Simple two-dimensional molded bodies such as for example tiles or surfaces can also<br>
generally be produced in open molds.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will be 'apparent from the dependent<br>
claims and the following description in which several embodiments of the invention are<br>
described in connection with the drawings. The features referred to in the claims and in the<br>
specification are essential for the invention individually or in any combination.<br><br>

so-called syrup with monomer components 5a, for example methyl methacrylate, and polymer<br>
components 5b, for example polymethyl methacrylate. In the uncured state the reaction mixture 2 is<br>

weight which is known from the prior art, in particular the visual quality of the produced molded<br>
plastic bodies 1 decreases with an increasing proportion of crosslinking agent and reaches an<br>
undesirable minimum at approximately 6% by weight. Surprisingly, as the proportion of the<br>
crosslinking agent 4 continues to increase the quality increases again and exceeds the quality of<br>
known molded plastic bodies in many applications for values above 10% by weight.<br><br>

a natural colored silica sand with a particle size from 0.05 to 0.3 mm, as sold by the DORFNER<br>
company under the trade name GEBA with a proportion of 19.526% and a crosslinking agent<br>
proportion of 2.95%.<br>
Formulations 2, 3, and 4 have the same filler, GEBA, with an essentially identical<br>
proportion by weight of approximately 68%, formulation 2 having the conventional proportion of<br>
crosslinking agent, formulation 3 the proportion of crosslinking agent according to the invention<br>
and formulation 4 having no crosslinking agent in order to obtain comparison values for the results<br>
which can be achieved with formulation 3 according to the invention. Aside from the filler,<br>
formulations 2 and 5 are similar, in order to obtained comparison values for different fillers at<br>
conventional proportions of crosslinking agents.<br>
The reaction mixture 2, besides the binder solution 5 which for its part has monomer<br>
portions 5a, in particular methyl methacrylate, and polymer portions 5b, and the filler 3, consists of<br>
a series of loading materials, including the crosslinking agent 4, a so-called internal separating agent<br>
for improved release of the cured molded body from the mold, pigments for coloring, antisettling<br>
agents for homogenization of the fillers in the reaction mixture to be cured and peroxides for<br>
uniform controlled starting of polymerization. In this connection, except for the pigments and the<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
13<br>
antisettling agents, the loading materials are added to the binder solution. The percentages for the<br>
crosslinking agent and the peroxides in the aforementioned formulations relate to the monomer.<br>
FIG. 5 shows in table form the results of the formulations of FIG. 4 with respect to<br>
important usage properties.<br>
This clearly indicates that formulation 3 according to the invention optimally combines the<br>
positive properties of formulations 1 and 2 with one another. The hot pot test (HTT) based on<br>
standard EN 13310 upon visual inspection does not show any detectable damage. The<br>
corresponding applies to the water vapor test (WDT) based on standard EN 13310.<br>
In the hot/cold cycle test based on standard EN 13310 there is no visible brightening and no<br>
perceptible roughening. Decorative cracks as a result of hot/cold cycles (HKZ) at the most appear<br>
slightly. The soiling test (AST) does not reveal any dirt residue; this confirms the good result<br>
relating to roughening after the hot/cold cycle test. The DE value of 0.46 corresponds to an only<br>
very slight color change. Finally the Taber abrasion test (TAT) according to DIN 53799 [DIN -<br>
German Industrial Standard] also yields a very low and thus good value; the level of the numerical<br>
value corresponds to the weight loss by abrasion per 100 revolutions.<br>
Formulation 1 yields a single-color black molded body with a smooth surface. Formulation<br>
2 yields a molded body with a granite appearance with a black ground shade. Formulation 3 yields a<br>
molded body with a novel surface in the color black. Formulation 3 yields a molded body with a<br>
smooth acrylic surface in the color black. Formulation 5 yields a molded body with granite<br>
appearance with a surface in the color black.<br>
One special feature of the molded body according to the invention consists in that the<br>
surface is very hard and thus has high scratch resistance. Moreover, especially smooth surfaces are<br>
formed, particularly when using fillers with an average and great grain size.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
14<br>
FIG. 6 shows in table form other results of the formulations of FIG. 4, this time relating to<br>
roughness before and after a scratch test and the Rockwell hardness. For hardness measurements<br>
sample pieces were produced without fillers, so that the hardness measurements are not adulterated<br>
by filler particles, but actually the hardness of the polymerized surface layer is determined. The<br>
hardness measurements were taken by means of a hardness measuring device ASTM 785-03 of<br>
ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, in West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959, USA. Here<br>
the Rockwell scale "£" was used which employs an indenter body ball with a diameter of 3.175 mm<br>
at a preliminary force of 10 kg and a main force of 100 kg. The measurements were taken according<br>
to a so-called "Procedure A" as is stated in the instruction "Standard Test Method for Rockwell<br>
Hardness of Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials" of ASTM International for D-785-03.<br>
As a result of the hardness test, for formulation 3 according to the invention a very good<br>
value of 17.0 arises, conversely for formulation 2 with a proportion of crosslinking agent of 3.05%<br>
by weight the value is 1.0, and the sample piece according to formulation 4 without a proportion of<br>
the crosslinking agent with -30.0 has the lowest value. Within the framework of these tests the<br>
crosslinking agent was trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM).<br>
FTG. 6 furthermore shows results of roughness measurements for determining the<br>
smoothness of the surface, For the measured parameters surface roughness Rt, maximum surface<br>
roughness Rmax and averaged surface roughness Rz, it holds that the measured values are smaller,<br>
the smoother the surface. The surface roughness Rt arises from the difference of a local maximum<br>
to a local minimum of a section of definable length of the measured sections. There are no<br>
standardized measurement conditions for this characteristic. The determination of the averaged<br>
surface roughness Rz and the maximum surface roughness Rmax was conversely carried out<br>
according to DIN 4768 or DIN EN ISO 11562, edition: 1998-09. The averaged surface roughness<br>
Rz is determined by averaging over five individual surface roughnesses so that the effect of outliers<br>
on the measured value is reduced. The maximum surface roughness Rmax is the greatest individual<br>
surface roughness within the overall measured distance, with a length which can be defined.<br><br>
WO 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
15<br>
The roughness was measured after producing the sample piece as "roughness before the<br>
scratch test". Then for sample pieces of formulations 2,3 and 4 without a filler and in sample pieces<br>
of formulations 1 and 3 with a filler a scratch test was run, the pertinent scratching device<br>
corresponding to DIN 53799 Tl0 or DIN 13310, and the scratching diamond having a 90° conical<br>
ground surface with 90 urn edge diameter. In the sample pieces of formulations 2,3 and 4 without<br>
fillers there was minor roughness, as expected, before the scratching test. This smooth surface is<br>
however greatly roughened by the scratch test for formulations 2 and 4 with a conventional<br>
proportion of crosslinking agent or without crosslinking agents, as follows from the high numerical<br>
values for parameters Rt, Rmax and Rz of more than 20. Conversely the sample piece according to<br>
formulation 3 according to the invention shows only relatively little roughening by the scratching<br>
test with measured values for Rt, Rmax and Rz of under 10 each.<br>
A corresponding result is also shown by the sample pieces of formulations 1 and 3 with<br>
fillers. Here for the sample piece of formulation 1 before the scratch test even smaller measured<br>
values for roughness arise, only because in formulation 1 a much finer filler is used, see FIG. 4.<br>
Formulation 3 according to the invention before the scratch test likewise yields very smooth<br>
surfaces with results for Rt, Rmax and Rz of a maximum 2, conversely formulations 2 and 4 which<br>
are comparable with respect to the filler used with a conventional proportion of crosslinking agent<br>
or without a portion of crosslinking agent have much higher roughness values of approximately 10<br>
or more, for which reason a comparable scratch test could no longer be conducted, and accordingly<br>
in FIG. 6 with respect to formulations 2 and 4 no measurement results for roughness after the<br>
scratch test are listed.<br>
It is striking here that proceeding from formulation 4 (no crosslinking agent) when the<br>
proportion of the crosslinking agent increases (formulation 2), the roughness first increases. It is<br>
quite surprising that as the proportion of the crosslinking agent continues to increase (formulation<br>
3), the roughness all at once decreases drastically and thus much smoother surfaces are formed. This<br><br><br>
 2006/048214	PCT/EP2005/011627<br>
16<br>
result corresponds to that behavior of the quality shown schematically in FIG. 2 over the proportion<br>
of the crosslinking agent<br>
Formulation 3 according to the invention after the scratch test also shows low roughness<br>
values of less than 3, conversely the comparison formulation 1 has much greater roughness in spite<br>
of the much finer filler used there.<br>
FIGS. 7a and 7b show the topography of the molded bodies which have been produced in<br>
cross section, FIG, 7a for a molded body 10 according to the prior art and FIG. 7b for a molded<br>
body 1 according to the invention. For the known molded body 10 shrinkage of the surface 16 of the<br>
molded body 10 away from the casting mold surface 20, as a result of shrinkage of the binder<br>
matrix and thus molding of the filler particles 13 to the surface of the molded body 10, and for this<br>
reason protrusion of the filler particles 13, occur. A topography forms on the surface 16 which is not<br>
decisively determined by the casting mold surface 20 and which is dependent on the size of the filler<br>
particles 13 and the distance of two adjacent filler particles 13. for fillers on the order of 100 and<br>
200 urn the maximum height difference 18 on the section between the two adjacent filler particles<br>
13 can be up to 13 um or up to 7% of the distance between the adjacent filler particles. For<br>
otherwise identical molded bodies 1 according to the invention which however have a high<br>
proportion of the crosslinking agent (FIG. 7b), this maximum height difference 18 on the distance<br>
between two adjacent filler particles 4 is less than 2 urn or less than 1% of the distance between the<br>
adjacent filler particles; this results in perfect reproduction of the casting mold surface 20.<br><br>
