Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Other objects and aspects of the invention will become<br>
20 apparent from the following description of the embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, which is set forth hereinafter.<br>
As  illustrated  in  Figs.  1  and  2,  the  powder distribution  apparatus  100  of  the  present  invention<br>
25 includes a housing 110 provided with an opening 112 to input tablets and a pulverization chamber 114; a pulverization block 120 for being joined with the housing 114, grinding tablets in the pulverization chamber 114; a distribution nozzle  140 connected to the pulverization<br>
30 chamber 114, for forming an outlet of the powdered medicine; and a distribution unit for distributing the powder pulverized in the pulverization chamber 114 to the distribution nozzle 140.<br>
The pulverization chamber  114  is  provided with a<br>
35  narrow bottom portion 116 with smaller sectional area than<br>
5<br><br>
that of the opening 112 as going down, and the opening is covered with a cover 118. On the side of the housing 110 is an operation panel (not shown) with a plurality of function buttons thereon, the panel equipping a press circuit board 5  and operating the powder distribution apparatus 100.<br>
The pulverization block 120 joined to the narrow bottom portion 116 of the pulverization chamber 114 includes a cutter 122 which being placed in the narrow bottom portion 116,   cuts up tablets and a motor 12 8 which<br>
10 being placed under the cutter 122, rotates the cutter 122 forward or backward. In accordance with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable to form the cutter blades 124 of the both ends in opposite direction to each other to pulverize tablets effectively.<br>
15 In the first embodiment of the present invention, there is one single cutter illustrated in the pulverization chamber 114, but to improve the pulverization efficiency, it is possible to form multi-cutters piled one over another as well as equipping a plurality of diverging shafts (not<br>
20 shown) and attaching a plurality of cutters 122 at each diverging shaft. The cutter 122 is connected to the driving shaft 126 separately. However, it"s also possible to attach it detached or attached by inserting it to the driving shaft 126 with force or combine it with bolts.<br>
25 The distribution nozzles 140 are arrayed radially centering around the housing 110, one end being linked to the pulverization chamber 114 and the other end being formed exposed to the outside of the housing 110. In a first embodiment Df the present invention, the exposed end<br>
30  of the housing 110 is provided with a powder distribution<br>
guiding part 142 r    the inner part of which formed like a<br>
shoehorn to descend the powdered medicine down. Each powder<br>
distribution guiding part is inserted with a predetermined<br>
medicine wrapper 160.<br>
35       Between   the  pulverization  block   120   and   the<br>
6<br><br><br>
\    distribution nozzles 140 is a distribution unit 150 for<br>
distributing   the   pulverized   medicine   through   the<br>
distribution nozzles 140.  The distribution unit 150 placed<br>
       between the cutter  122  and the motor  12 8  includes a<br>
.5 rotation disk 152 whose external circumferential surface is i neighboring the distribution nozzles 140, and a transmission member which being laid between the driving shaft 126 and the rotation disk 152, transmits or blocks the rotatory power by the rotating direction of the cutter<br>
10 122 to or from the rotating plate 152. The first preferred embodiment of the present invention employs a one-way clutch bearing 156 as a transmission member.<br>
In the central region of the rotation disk 152 is a boss block 154 for being combined with the driving shaft<br>
15 126. By inserting a fixing pin (not shown) to the boss block 154, it can be joined to the driving shaft 126. Another method for combining the rotation disk 152 to the driving shaft 126 is to combine the two separably, make spline bond, set the rotation disk to the driving shaft<br>
20  with heat, or in the method of insert-and-fix with strength.<br>
A predetermined width of a gap d is formed between the<br>
surface of the rotation disk 152 and the protrusion 144<br>
projected downward from the end of the narrow bottom<br>
portion 116.  The powdered medicine in the pulverization<br>
25  chamber 114 is ejected through the gap Gi as the rotation<br>
disk 152 is rotated by the driving motor 128. Therefore, it<br>
is desirable to form the gap G\   narrowly to distribute the<br>
powder to respective distribution nozzles 14 0 homogeneously.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 3A an 3B, the one-way clutch<br>
30 bearing 156 rotates the shaft inside in one direction only and suppresses it rotating in reverse. The one-way clutch bearing 156 of the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of rolling members 158 and a bearding body 157 provided with holding grooves 159 for<br>
35  accommodating the rolling members 158.  With the depth of<br>
7<br><br>
each holding groove 159 of the bearing body 157 molded one side deeper than the other side, when a rolling member is located in the deeper side, the rotatory power of the driving shaft 126 installed inside is not transmitted to 5 the bearing body 157. But if it is in the shallower region of the holding groove the rotatory power of the driving shaft 126 is transmitted to the bearing body 157. Therefore, when the rotatory power of the driving shaft 12 6 is transmitted to the bearing body 157, the rotation disk 152<br>
10  rotates together with the cutter 122.<br>
In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the operation procedure of the apparatus for distributing powder with this structure will be described hereinafter. <br>
15 First, a plurality of medicine wrappers are inserted to the powder distribution guiding part 142 of each distribution nozzle 140. The cover 118 is opened and the tablets to be pulverized are inputted to the pulverization chamber 114, then the cover 118 is closed.  Pressing an<br>
20 operation button, and when the motor 128 begins to rotate in one direction, the cutter 122 connected to the driving shaft 126 of the motor 128 rotates and crashes up the tablets inside the pulverization chamber 114. At this moment, because the rolling member 158 of the one-way<br>
25 clutch bearing 156 comes to be in the deep region of the holding groove 159, the bearing body 157 cannot receive the rotatory power of the driving shaft 126. Conclusively, in the procedures of pulverizing tablets into powder, the cutter 122 does rotate while the rotation disk 152 does not.<br>
30 After a predetermined time passes, when the pulverization procedures are completed, the operation button should be pressed and the motor 12 8 should be rotated in reverse to that direction of the prior rotation above.   Then the rolling member of the one-way clutch<br>
35  bearing 156 gets to be in the shallow part of the holding<br>
8<br><br>
groove 159 and the rotatory power of the driving shaft 12 6 is transmitted to the bearing body 157, thus the rotation disk 152 can rotate along with the cutter 122. Due to the centrifugal force of the rotation disk 152 that rotates 5 together with the cutter 122, the pulverized powder in the pulverization chamber 114 is inputted to the medicine wrappers 150 via the respective distribution nozzles 140 after passing through the gap G1 between the protrusion 144 and the rotation disk 152.<br>
10 As shown above, the present invention integrates the jobs of pulverizing and moderately distributing the powdered medicine to be conducted in one apparatus by guiding the pulverized medicine to the distribution nozzles 140 inserted with medicine wrappers 150 by the centrifugal<br>
15  force.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is employing a one-way clutch bearing 156 as a transmission member. Besides, it is possible to equip a fixed clutch for connecting the connection shaft and the driving shaft 12 6<br>
20 of the motor 128 so as to rotate them integrated, after setting up an extra connection shaft for driving the cutter 122, and an operative clutch bearing that being installed integratedly movable up and down on the roatation plate 152 along the line of shaft, engages with the fixed clutch<br>
25 member so as to be moved integratedly while descending. At this time, after a separate lever is made exposed on the housing 110, the operative clutch can be engaged with or disconnected from the fixed clutch with the lever.<br>
Also, in the first embodiment of the present invention,<br>
30 the pulverization of tablets and the distribution of the powder are conducted with the operations of the functional buttons. However, they can be performed with a single process integrating a series of procedures by using a predetermined MICOM or a timer and operates a button once.<br>
35       The first embodiment of the present invention inserts<br>
9<br><br>
medicine wrappers upwards. However, in case the exposed end of the distribution nozzle is formed horizontally, it"s possible to insert the wrapper inward in the direction towards the inside of the radius. Also, to prevent medicine 5 wrappers inserted to the powder distribution guiding part 142 from coming out of it, a separate medicine wrapper secession preventive (not shown) may be provided. Here, on the bottom surface of the wrapper secession preventive is provided with a motor holding groove (not shown) for being<br>
10 inserted with the motor 128, and the side of it stretches the region neighboring the powder distribution guiding part 142. Thus, the medicine wrappers 150 are supported by both bottom and side of the wrapper secession preventive and do not come out of the apparatus.<br>
15 As illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus 200 for distributing powder includes: a cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 for crashing tablets; and distribution nozzle 240 combined with the cylindrical<br>
20 pulverization chamber 214 rotatably, for distributing the powder pulverized in the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 at a predetermined amount.<br>
In  accordance with the  second embodiment  of  the present  invention,  the  apparatus  200  for  distributing<br>
25 powder includes: a cover 218 for closing the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214; a first spring 211 for supporting the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 upwards; a pressing plate 215 for surrounding the housing 210; a first and a second heat wires 272, 274 for sealing<br>
30 medicine wrappers; a shaft 271 for fixing the first heat wires 272 movably; a second spring 213; and a pulverization unit 220.    Also, the pulverization unit 220 includes a<br>
cutter 222, cutter blades 224, driving shaft 226 and a motor 228.  The second embodiment of the present invention<br>
35  further includes an upper motor housing 282 and lower motor<br><br>
housing 284 for covering the motor 228.   Also, a third<br>
 spring 217 is fixed on the lower part of the upper motor housirrg 2"l32 and the location where it is fixed determines the position the second heat wire 274. seals up a medicine 5  wrapper.<br>
In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, the operation of the apparatus 2 00 for distributing powder with the above structure will be described hereinafter.<br>
10 First of all, a plurality of medicine wrappers are inserted to the powder distribution guiding part 242 of the distribution nozzles 240. Then the distribution noz-zles 240 combined with the cutter blades 224 and the driving shaft 226 are joined to  the motor 228.  The housing 210 combined<br>
15 with the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214, pressing plate 215 and the cover 218 is placed on the distribution nozzle 240. The cover 218 is opened and tablets to be pulverized are inputted through the opening 212, and then the cover 218 is closed.  The motor 228 rotates in one<br>
2 0 direction by pressing the functional button, and the cutter 222 connected to the driving shaft 226 of the motor 228 rotates along, crashing up the tablets inside the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214. The operation of the one-way clutch bearing is similar to that of the first<br>
25 embodiment. The second embodiment takes feature in that it does not rotate the distribution nozzles 240 while the cutter 22 rotates by pushing the cover 218 lightly with the hand and contacting the bottom of the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 with the distribution nozzles 240.<br>
30 When predetermined time passes and the pulverization of medicine is completed, the motor 228 is made to rotate in reverse to the direction of the prior rotation by operating functional buttons. This operation is also similar to that of the first embodiment.  However, when<br>
35  withdrawing the hand pushing the cover 218 lightly in the<br>
11<br><br>
second embodiment, the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 gets aparted from the bottom of the distribution nozzle 240 thus forming a predetermined length of gap G2 due to the restitution force of the first spring 211. At this moment, 5 the motor rotates backward and thus the distribution nozzle 240 comes to be separated with the cutter 222 and gets to rotate in reverse to the direction the cutter 222 had rotated. The medicine pulverized in the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214  is  inputted to the medicine<br>
10 wrappers by the centrifugal force via the powder distribution guiding part 242 after passing through the gap G2 between the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 and the distribution nozzle 240.<br>
When the distribution of the powder is completed, the<br>
15 housing 210 combined with the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214, the pressing plate 215 and the cover 218 is detached from the distribution nozzle 240. The distribution nozzle 240 joined with the cutter blade 224, the driving shaft 226 and medicine wrappers, is separated from the<br>
20 motor 228. Then, pushing the pressing plate 215, the medicine wrappers are sealed up at where the first heat wire 272 and the second heat wire 274 meet. Although not illustrated in the drawings, the first heat wire 2 72 and the second heat wire 274 are charged with electricity and<br>
25  when sealing the medicine wrappers, it maintains quite high temperature.   Also,  one characteristic of the present invention is that it can distribute the powdered medicine in an equal amount incomparably precisely than doing it manually, because it distributes the powder into the powder<br>
30 distribution guiding part 242, which has the same size of insertion area, by making use of the centrifugal force that occurs while rotating the distribution nozzle 240.<br>
In the second embodiment, it is desirable to use an shaft joint 290 that prevents the nozzle shaft from coming<br>
35  out while the driving shaft 226 rotates,  because the<br><br>
distribution nozzle 240 connected to the cutter blade 224 should be detached from the driving shaft 226 of the motor 228 at any time when medicine is prepared. Referring to the cross-sectional view of the magnified part of Fig. 5, 5 plumbs 292 are stretched out by the centrifugal force while the motor 228 rotates. They are inserted to the grooves 296 formed at the corresponding positions on the internal surface of the driving shaft 226 which is connected to the distribution nozzle 240, protecting the distribution nozzle<br>
10  240 from getting aparted.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention as well, the procedures pulverizing tablets and distributing the powder at a moderate amount can be performed through a single  process  including  a  series  of  procedures  by<br>
15 operating a function button once using a MICOM or a timer. Also, as the powder distribution guiding parts 242 of the distribution nozzle 240 are arrayed radially, it is desirable to use medicine wrappers arranged in a circle.<br>
Referring to Figs. 6A and 6B,	a perspective and a<br>
20 plane figures of a small tablet distribution funnel 300, respectively, in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. The small tablet distribution funnel 300 includes a funnel 310, a handle 330, and a tablet distribution guiding parts 320-325 in the shape of a number<br>
25 of rice scoops. Here, the number of tablet distribution guiding parts can be formed freely like six, nine, twelve, etc.<br>
When inputting a number of tablets onto the funnel 300 after putting medicine wrappers on a plurality of<br>
30 tablet distribution guiding parts 320-325, the powdered medicine is distributed to corresponding medicine wrappers through the tablet distribution guiding parts 320-325. Referring to Fig. 6B, in case of designing the sizes of the funnel  310  and the  tablet  distribution  guiding parts<br>
35  320-325 of the small tablet distribution funnel 300 in<br>
13<br><br>
consideration of the sizes of the distribution nozzle 240 and the cylindrical pulverization chamber 214 of the second embodiment, medicine wrappers can be sealed up with the small tablet distribution funnel 300 of the present 5 invention by using the first and the second heat wires 272, 274 of the powder distribution apparatus 200 whose housing 210 and distribution nozzle 240 are separated in the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fi. 7  illustrates  a cross-sectional  view of  an<br>
10 automatic powder distribution apparatus 400 in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The automatic powder distribution apparatus 400 of the present invention includes: a tablet induction block 402 for being provided  with  tablets   from  the  automatic   tablet<br>
15 distribution system and guiding them to the powder distribution apparatus 400; a pulverization chamber cover 404 for preventing the powder from flying in the air during the pulverization; a pulverization chamber 406 for pulverizing tablets; a cutter blade 428 for pulverizing<br>
20 tablets; a rotation disk 422; a first motor 436; and one-way clutch bearings 424, 426. Also, the automatic powder distribution system 400 of the present invention further includes: a rotation disk 420 for distributing powdered medicine; a partitioned box 420 for containing the powder<br>
25 dispersed in the direction of the centrifugal force while the rotation disk 420 rotates, of which the central direction is open and the other directions are closed; a weight plumb 416; a horizontal shaft 418 for connecting the partitioned box 420 and the weight plumb 416, forming a<br>
30 circumference when looked down; a partitioned box support 414 for propping the horizontal shaft 418 and rotating with the horizontal shaft 418 at the center at as much an angle as allowed; an electro-magnet 413; an electro-magnet support 412 for propping the electro-magnet 413; a bearing<br>
35  430;  a first motor 436; a first motor housing 434 for<br>
14<br><br>
covering the first motor 436; a second motor 44 0; a funnel 432; and a transfer system 438.<br>
The  operation  procedures  of  the  automatic  powder distribution system 400 with above structure in accordance 5  with a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter.<br>
First of all, tablets are provided from the automatic tablet distribution system and inputted to the pulverization chamber 406 through the tablet induction<br>
10 block 402, and then the pulverization chamber cover 404 is put on. The functional buttons being operated, the first motor 436 rotates forward and crashes tablets with the cutter blade 428.<br>
After  the  pulverization  finishes,  the  powdered<br>
15 medicine is distributed to the partitioned box 420 through the gap G3 between the pulverization chamber 406 and the rotation disk 422, by rotating the first motor 436 backward and thus rotating the rotation disk 422 connected thereto. The fourth embodiment of the present invention makes it<br>
20 possible to rotate the first monitor 436 both forwards and backwards with the one-way clutch bearing 424, 426. Also, the partitioned box 420 is a container for holding the pulverized powder that has dispersed in the direction of centrifugal force while the rotation disk 422 rotates.  The<br>
25 partitioned box 42 0 includes a plurality of compartments which are arrayed radially when looked down. The partitioned box 420 is open in the central direction but closed in other directions and it is a circular structure formed with a plurality of compartments placed closely to<br>
30 each other. In case of manufacturing a big apparatus, it is desired to make 90 compartments. Here, in case one makes 15 doses of medicine for five-day usage he can put the powder in six compartments into one medicine wrapper. In the present invention, the partitioned box 420 is designed to<br>
35  maintain the horizon to the rotation disk 422 by the<br>
15<br><br>
gravity of the weight plumb 416 connected thereto with the horizontal shaft 418.<br>
After the distribution of the pulverized medicine into the partitioned box 420, the rotating cylinder 410 is moved 5 one click aside with the driving shaft 450 of the first motor 436 at the center by rotating the second motor 440. The rotating cylinder 410 includes partitioned box supports 414 as many as the number of compartments on the circumference.   When they rotate one click aside,  one<br>
10  compartment is moved and gets located above the funnel 432.<br>
By  charging  electricity on  the  electromagnet  413<br>
connected to the electromagnet support 412 and moving the<br>
weight  plumb  416  towards  the  electromagnet  413,  the<br>
compartment above the funnel 432 is rotated downwards and<br>
15 the powder contained therein is moved onto the funnel 432. For instance, in case one uses a big apparatus with a partitioned box of 90 compartments and divides medicine into 15 doses for five-day usage with, he can install several electromagnets 413 so as to rotate six compartments<br>
20 at once, move all the medicine therein onto the funnel 432 at a time and put it into one medicine wrapper. Also, the 15 doses of medicine for 5-day usage can be sealed up by clicking six times on the funnel 432, putting all the powdered medicine of the six compartments onto the funnel<br>
25  432, and delivering it to the transfer system 438.<br>
Although it"s not described in the detailed description of the invention, if a sleeve cuff ring is used instead of the one-way clutch bearing in the embodiments of the present invention, it"s possible to distribute powdered<br>
30 medicine in the same apparatus by pulverizing tablets by rotating the cutter blade for a certain time and rotating the distribution nozzle in the same direction the cutter blade rotates.<br>
