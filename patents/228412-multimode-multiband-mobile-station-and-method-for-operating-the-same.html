				<td>A multimode/multiband mobile station and a method for operating the same are provided. A transmission module transmits multimode/multiband signals through transmitters. A reception module receives radio signals for different services of the same frequency band among multimode/multiband signals through receivers for the same frequency band, and receives radio signals of different frequency bands among the multimode/multiband signals through receivers for the different frequency bands.

MULTEMODE/MULTIBAND MOBILE STATION AND METHOD FOR<br>
OPERATING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a wireless transceiver, and in particular, to a mobile station supporting multi-modes and multi-bands.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, various access standards used for wireless networks have been being developed (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband CDMA (WCDMA), The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)-801.16, etc.). However, a rapid increase of the wireless access standards results in inconvenience to mobile stations (or terminals), such as cell-phones, personal data assistant (PDA) devices and mobile laptop computers, and difficulty in manufacturing the mobile stations. In addition, subscribers' expectation on existing networks cannot be satisfied with mobile stations supporting only a few available standards.<br>
To deal with this, mobile stations are transited to a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) architecture, thereby providing a single hardware platform for multiple wireless interface technology. Due to continuous development of semiconductor process technology, a mobile station (or wireless terminal) can be changed to a communication transceiving system having a specific standard or a specific purpose by performing software reconstruction of a signal processing function, which takes a high proportion in the operation of the mobile station, on a single hardware platform, thereby providing various wireless standards in one system. There are many types of software reconfigurable hardware, e.g., a fixed functional block having changeable parameters and a flexible interconnection function. The software reconfigurable hardware can be implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).<br><br>
PCTYKR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005<br>
-2-<br>
For an-SDR design, a board space, material costs, current consumption for battery persistency, and a low level of the number of components should be considered. In addition, expectation to obtain a capability of roaming between various standards requires an SDR receiver to perform a quicker search and handoff. However, in general, greater power is necessary for quicker processing. For conventional development of mobile stations, various types of hardware are necessary for satisfying various wireless standards. For a design of conventional receivers, a zero-intermediate-frequency (ZIF) architecture in which an entire receiver front end is implemented using analog elements is used.<br>
In the conventional ZIF architecture, a direct type down converter uses a narrowband device unsuitable for broadband applications. Besides, for a receiver design, parts are digitalized at an intermediate frequency (IF).<br>
Thus technology for mobile stations implemented by optimizing software reconfigurable hardware components in a receiver front end is necessary. In particular, a receiver in which the reconfigurable components can be used before conversion to a digital signal at an IF level is necessary.<br>
In common, mobile communication services are provided in different communication service methods for countries (regions) over the world, using several frequency bands for each communication service method. For example, the mobile communication service methods are provided using the CDMA technique, the GSM technique and the WCDMA technique for the countries (regions), wherein the CDMA technique uses frequency bands of 800MHz, 1800MHz and 1900MHz, the GSM technique uses frequency bands of 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz and 1900MHz, and the WCDMA technique uses frequency bands of 850MHz, 1900MHz and 2000MHz.<br>
The conventional mobile stations are constructed to use signals of one or two frequency bands, corresponding to desired communication services among the mobile communication services. As a result, each mobile station can use only one or two mobile communication services among the various mobile communication<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 - 3 -<br>
services in the countries over the world. AccOrdingly;when a subscriber goes to another region in which a different communication service is provided for a travel or a business trip, it is inconvenient since his/her own mobile station cannot be used.<br>
Thus subscribers want a mobile station with which all kinds of mobile communication services of the countries over the world can be provided. Mobile station manufacturers are trying to produce mobile stations so that all kinds of mobile communication services of the countries over the world can be used through one mobile station in response to the request of the subscribers. To use all kinds of mobile communication services of the countries over the world and frequency bands for the services, a mobile station supporting multi-modes and multi-bands is required.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a wireless communication system 100 in which a multimode/multiband mobile station (or wireless terminal) 111 communicates with base stations operating based on various wireless interface standards. In FIG. 1, it is assumed that a base station (BS) 101 is a portion of a first wireless network operating based on a first wireless interface standard (e.g., CDMA 2000). It is also assumed that a base station (BS) 102 is a portion of a second wireless network operating based on a second wireless interface standard (e.g., GSM). The mobile station (MS) 111 can communicate with the BS 101 by being configured through a first software load and communicate with the BS 102 by being reconfigured through a second software load. The software load can be manually selected by a user input or automatically selected by detecting a signal from the BS 101 or the BS 102.<br>
The present invention is not limited to only actual mobile devices. In addition, the present invention is generally applied to other types of wireless terminals such as a fixed wireless terminal. However, description about only a mobile station will now be provided for simplicity and clearness. Though, the terminology "mobile station" used in claims and the description inclusively means an actual mobile device (e.g., wireless phone or wireless laptop) or a fixed wireless terminal (e.g., device monitor having wireless capability).<br>
FIG. 2 is a block' diagram of the multimode/multiband mobile station (MS) 1ll according to a preferred first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the MS 111 includes an antenna array 201, a switchplexer<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -8-<br>
205, a reconfigurable receive path 210a, a reconfigurable receive path 210b and a reconfigurable software-defined radio (SDR) modem block 260. The SDR modem block 260 is typically a multi-purpose device or a semi-custom device, necessarily having characteristics changed by loading new software. The MS 111 also includes a transmit path 270 and a plurality of band pass filters (BPFs) 275, e.g., a BPF 275a, a BPF 275b and a BPF 275c. The MS 111 further includes a plurality of power amplifiers (PAs) 280, e.g., a PA 280a, a PA 280b and a PA 280 c.<br>
The present embodiment implements a more efficient search algorithm using the same dual receive paths 210a and 210b, thereby more easily performing a roaming operation. Thus, even if a user moves to several areas in which different wireless standards are supported, the user can use the same mobile station. The dual path structure makes remote reconfiguration of an intermediate frequency (IF) filter and a digital IF possible. Since the reconfigurable receive paths 210a and 210b are actually the same, only the reconfigurable receive path 210a will now be described in detail. However, the description of the reconfigurable receive path 210a is applied to the reconfigurable receive path 210b with the same effect.<br>
The reconfigurable receive path 210a includes an input end 212 comprised of selectable low noise amplifiers (LNAs), a switch 215, a broadband image rejection (IR) mixer 216, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and frequency controlled oscillator block 218, configurable blocking BPF 220, a programmable variable gain amplifier (VGA) 225 and a configurable anti-alias BPF 230. The reconfigurable receive path 210a further includes a programmable analog/digital converter (ADC) 235, an IF mixer 240, a numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) 245, a digital channel filter block 250, a re-sampler 252, a digital/analog converter (DAC) 255 and a configuration controller 229.<br>
The configuration controller 229 controls configuration of the reconfigurable receive path 210a. According to a selected wireless interface, the<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005<br>
-9-<br>
configuration controller 229 performs reconfiguration of the reconfigurable blocks included in the reconfigurable receive path 210a by transmitting a command or configuration parameters to them. For simplicity, there are not shown connection lines between the configuration controller 229 and other components included in the reconfigurable receive path 210a.<br>
The input end 212 comprised of selectable LNAs is, for example, comprised of an LNA 212a, an LNA 212b and an LNA 212c. The input end 212 comprised of selectable LNAs receives an incoming radio frequency (RF) signal from the switchplexer 205. Each of the LNA 212a, the LNA 212b and the LNA 212c is optimized to amplify the RF signal within a selected frequency range. For example, the selectable LNA 212a can amplify a signal within a range of 2.0 to 2.1 GHz with a minimum consumption power, another selectable LNA 212b can amplify a signal within a range of 1800 to 1900 MHz with a minimum consumption power, and the other selectable LNA 212c can amplify a signal within a range of 860 to 960 MHz with a minimum consumption power. By using LNAs, each optimized to a specific frequency band, the multimode/multiband capability of the MS 111 is intensified.<br>
The switch 215 selects only one input signal among the selectable LNAs and provides the input signal to a.n input end of the broadband IR mixer 216. To reduce power consumption, LNAs not selected by the switch 215 may be turned off. The broadband IR mixer 216 receives a programmable reference signal from the VCO and frequency controlled oscillator block 218 and down converts the RF signal selected by the switch to an IF level, e.g., 10 MHz. The broadband IR mixer 216 performs near-zero intermediate frequency (NZIF) down conversion. It is preferable that the IR is performed by only the broadband IR mixer.<br>
Interferers are removed by filtering an IF" signal output from the broadband IR mixer 216 using the configurable blocking BPF 220. After filtering further proceeds using the configurable anti-alias BPF 230, the programmable VGA 225 adjusts the IF signal level to an optimized predetermined for ADC 235, after further filtering by configurable anti-alias bandpass filter(BPF) 230. In the<br><br>
PCT7KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -10-<br>
present embodiment, the ADC 235 samples the IF signal at a rate of 40 Msps.<br>
The digital IF sample generated by the ADC 235 is down-converted to a baseband by the IF mixer 240 and the NCO 245. Baseband In-phase I and Quadrature-phase Q signals output from the IF mixer 240 are filtered by the digital channel filter block 250. The filtered baseband I and Q signals are re-sampled by the re-sampler 252 and then matched to a rate of the SDR modem block 260. If the SDR modem block receives an analog input, the DAC 255 converts the digital I and Q signals to analog signals.<br>
The NZIF down conversion allows a digital intermediate frequency (DIF) design of a low sampling rate for converting a current. The broadband IR mixer 216 is an advanced linear mixer, corresponding to an important block in an RF design. According to the new architecture, measurement using a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement for a digital signal processing (DSP) function, i.e., a search function, through a receiver is possible, and current consumption can be optimized as well.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart 300 illustrating a search mode operation performed by the multimode/multiband mobile station 111 according to the preferred first embodiment of the present invention. It is assumed that the receive path 210b receives a signal based on a first wireless interface standard and the receive path 210a1 searches for a signal of a second wireless interface standard based on a set search algorithm. The switchplexer 205 selects one of input ends of the LNAs 212a to 212c, the input end belonging to a frequency band matched to the second wireless interface standard, in step 305. The switch 215 connects an output of the selected LNA to an input of the broadband IR mixer 216 in step 310. The VCO and frequency controlled oscillator block 218 oscillates a frequency corresponding to. a channel for a frequency band matched to the search algorithm, and the IR mixer 216 down converts the LNA output using the channel for the frequency band matched to,the search algorithm in step 315. The blocking BPF 220 is also configured to filter the down-converted signal using a predetermined channel bandwidth in step 320.<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -11-<br>
The digital IF section (i.e.,. the IF mixer 240, the NCO 245, the filter block 250, the re-sampler 252 and the DAC 255) is reconfigured for each mode (e.g., GSM, general packet radio system (GPRS), Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE)),-CDMA, WCDMA or 802.11) in step 325. The received signal strength (RSS) can be measured by installing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in the output end of the digital channel filter block 250 in step 330. If the signal strength at the output end of the digital channel filter block 250 exceeds that of the signal received by the receive path 210b, the VCO and frequency controlled oscillator block 218 is locked to the selected channel in step 335. The modem 260 performs mode identification and reconfigures the anti-alias BPF 230.<br>
In the multirnode/multiband mobile station according to the preferred first embodiment of the present invention, LNAs for bands are included in each of the receive path 210b receiving a signal of the first wireless interface standard and the receive path 210a receiving a signal of the second wireless interface standard. The multimode/multiband mobile station performs communication by selecting one input of the LNAs for bands included in the dual receive paths.<br>
Based on the configuration according to the preferred first embodiment of the present invention, the multimode/multiband mobile station (or terminal) for using in wireless networks operating under various wireless interface standards can be provided.<br>
A multimode/multiband mobile station according to a preferred second embodiment of the present invention is configured to perform communication by selecting one input of LNAs for bands but using combined LNAs for frequency bands common to every wireless interface standard.<br>
A multimode/multiband mobile station according to the preferred second embodiment of-the present invention will now be described in detail. FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a multimode/multiband mobile station according to the preferred second embodiment of title present invention. FIG. 4 shows an example<br><br>

Referring to FIG. 4, the multimode/multiband mobile station according to the preferred second embodiment of the present invention includes a transmission module 410, a reception module 420, a duplexer module 430, a switch and power amplifier module 440, a first antenna switch 450 and a second antenna switch 460.<br>
The transmission module 410 includes transmitters for services and frequency bands and transmits a signal corresponding to a relevant communication service and frequency band through each transmitter. The transmission module 410, for example, can be configured by including a WCDMA2000 transmitter 411, a WCDMA1900 transmitter 412 and a WCDMA850 transmitter 413 for transmitting radio signals based on the first wireless interface standard of a frequency division duplex (FDD) technique and a DCS1800/PCS1900 transmitter 414 and a GSM850/GSM900 transmitter 415 for transmitting radio signals based on the second wireless interface standard of a time division duplex (TDD) technique.

For example, when the first switch control signal for receiving a signal of<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -35-<br>
the GSM85O band is received, the first antenna switch 650 makes a GSM850 signal received through the first antenna transferred to the WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 by connecting the first antenna to the third duplexer 633. When the first switch control signal for receiving a signal of the DCS 1800 band, the first antenna switch 650 also makes a signal received through the first antenna transferred to the DCS 1800 receiver 624 through the transmission/reception and band selection switch 641 by connecting the first antenna to the transmission/reception and band selection switch 641.<br>
The transmission/reception and band selection switch 641 makes a desired GSM receiver selected by connecting the first antenna switch 650 to a GSM receiver of a corresponding band in response to the second switch control signal SWC2. For example, when the second switch control signal for receiving a signal of the GSM900 band among GSM reception signals is received, the transmission/reception and band selection switch 641 makes a signal received through the first antenna switch 650 transferred to the GSM900 receiver 625 by connecting the first antenna switch 650 to the GSM900 receiver 625.<br>

RO/KR 13.05.2005 -36-<br>
The controller 982 controls to operate only receivers corresponding to a mode and band to be received among the receivers 621 to 628 for modes and bands in response to the SPI signal received from the modem controller 991. For example, if a signal to be received is the WCDMA2000 band, the controller 982 controls to operate only the WCDMA2000 receiver 621 and WCDMA2000(D) receiver 626 in response to the SPI signal received from the modem controller 991. If the signal to be received is the GSM850 band, the controller 982 controls to operate only the WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 in response to the SPI signal received from the modem controller 991.<br>
If the signal to be received is the WCDMA/GSM combined band, the controller 982 outputs a control signal to control an LNA gain of a WCDMA/GSM combined receiver to a WCDMA or GSM gain. For example, if the signal to be received is one of WCDMA/PCS1900 bands, the controller 982 outputs a signal LCI to control a gain of the LNA 22 of the WCDMA/PCS1900 combined receiver 622 to a gain corresponding to one of the WCDMA 1900 and PCS1900 bands.

Each of the receivers 621 to 628 for modes and bands low-noise-amplifies a signal corresponding to its own band in response to a control of the controller 982. In particular, the WCDMA/PCS1900 combined receiver 622 and the WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 control the LNA gain to the gain corresponding to the WCDMA and the gain corresponding to the GSM in response to the signals LCI and LC2 received from the controller 982 and simultaneously low-noise-amplify a WCDMA signal' and a GSM' signal, respectively.<br>

Referring to FIGs. 11A and 11B, when a WCDMA signal is received, the WCDMA/PCS1900- combined receiver 622 and the WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 control the LNA gain by three levels based on reception strengths PI and P2 of the WCDMA signal as shown in FIG. 11A. When a GSM signal is received, the WCDMA/PCS1900 combined receiver 622 and the WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 control the LNA gain by three levels based on reception strengths P3 and P4 of the GSM signal as shown in FIG. 11B. The reception strengths PI, P2, P3 and P4 can vary according to a modem algorithm.<br>
The signal low-noise-ampHfied by the receivers 621 to 628 for modes and bands is input to the first mixer 680 or the second miser 690, which is a wideband mixer.<br>
The controller 982 controls the first local frequency L01 provided to the first mixer 680 and the second local frequency L02 provided to the second mixer 690 to local frequencies corresponding to corresponding reception modes and bands. Accordingly, the first mixer 680 down converts a signal input from one of the WCDMA2000 receiver 621, WCDMA/PCS1900 combined receiver 622 and WCDMA/GSM850 combined receiver 623 corresponding to the main band using the first local frequency L01. The second mixer 690 down converts a signal input from one of the DCS1800 receiver 624, GSM900 receiver 625 and WCDMA diversity receivers 626 to 628 corresponding to the sub-band using the second local frequency L02.<br>
The main band signal down converted by the first mixer 680 is input to the first baseband processing unit 984, and the first baseband processing unit 984 outputs the down converted main band signal as the first baseband signal in response to a control of the controller 982. The sub-band signal down converted by-the second mixer 690 is input to the second baseband processing unit 986, and the' second baseband processing unit 986 outputs- the down converted sub-band signal as the second baseband signal in response to a control of the controller 982.<br><br>

FIG. 12 is a block diagram illustrating the baseband signal processing operation of the multimode/multiband mobile station according to the preferred second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the first baseband processing unit 984 includes an A/D converter 1, a digital automatic gain controller (AGC) 2, a channel filter 3, a DC offset compensator 4 and a D/A converter 5.<br>
The A/D converter 1 receives the main band signal down converted by the first mixer 680 and converts the down converted main band signal to a digital signal. The digital AGC 2 controls a gain of the converted main band digital signal. The channel filter 3 may be a low pass filter (LPF), receiving the main band digital signal and filtering it to pass only a corresponding channel signal. The DC offset compensator 4 compensates for a DC offset of the filtered channel signal. The D/A converter 5 converts the DC-offset-compensated channel signal to an analog signal and outputs the converted analog signal as the first baseband signal.<br>
According to the preferred second embodiment of the present invention, the main band signal can be the WCDMA2000, WCDMA1900, PCS 1900, WCDMA850 or GSM850 band, and the controller 982 controls the first baseband processing unit 984 in response to the SPI signal received from the modem controller 991. Accordingly, each of the A/D converter 1, digital AGC 2, channel filter 3, DC offset compensator 4 and D/A converter 5 of the first baseband processing unit 984 operates with changing its characteristic according to a reception band characteristic under the control of the controller 982.<br>
For example, when the reception band is the GSM85O band, each of the A/P converter 1, digital AGC 2,^channel5.filter 3; DC offset compensator 4 and D/A converter 5 of the first baseband processing unit 984 operates according to a GSM850 band characteristic under the control of the controller 982. When the<br><br>
PCT/US2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -39-<br>
reception band is the WCDMA850 band, each of the A/D converter I, digital AGC 2, channel filter 3, DC offset compensator 4 and D/A converter 5 of the first baseband processing unit 984 operates according to a WCDMA850 band characteristic under the control of the controller 982.<br>
The second baseband processing unit 986 operates in a method similar to the first baseband processing unit 984 and the sub-band signal, i.e., a DCS1800, GSM900, WCDMA2000(D), WCDMA1900(D) or WCDMA850(D) band signal, as the second baseband signal.<br>
Since the first baseband processing unit 984 processes the WCDMA2000, WCDMA1900, PCS 1900, WCDMA850 or GSM850 band, the first baseband signal output from the first baseband processing unit 984 can be a WCDMA signal or a GSM signal.<br>
Also, since the second baseband processing unit 986 processes the DCSI800, GSM900, WCDMA2000(D), WCDMA1900(D) or WCDMA850(D) band, the second baseband signal output from the second baseband processing unit 986 can be a GSM signal or a WCDMA diversity signal.<br>
The baseband processing unit 980 outputs the first and second baseband signals to the modem module 990 by classifying them into the WCDMA baseband signal, GSM baseband signal and WCDMA diversity signal.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 9, the modem module 990 receives a baseband signal corresponding to the WCDMA through an IIQl path and receives a baseband signal corresponding to the GSM or WCDMA diversity through an I2Q2 path.<br>
Thus, if,.the . first baseband signal output from "the^first baseband processing unit 9.84-is a.WGDMA signal, the baseband processing;unit,980 outputs the first baseband signal to'the II Ql path, and if the first baseband signal is a GSM signal, the baseband processing unit 980 outputs the GSM baseband<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -40-<br>
signal to the I2Q2 path through the multiplexer1988.<br>
The baseband processing unil 980 also outputs the second baseband signal (GSM or WCDMA diversity signal) output from the second baseband processing unit 986 to the I2Q2 path through the multiplexer 988.<br>
The multiplexer 988 outputs the GSM baseband signal output from the first baseband processing unit 984 or the GSM or WCDMA diversity baseband signal output from the second baseband processing unit 986 to the I2Q2 path.<br>
A WCDMA modem 992 of the modem module 990 demodulates the WCDMA baseband signal received through the I1Q1 path.<br>
A demultiplexer 993 of the modem module 990 receives the GSM or WCDMA diversity baseband signal through the I2Q2 path, outputs the GSM baseband signal to a GSM modem 94 if the GSM baseband signal is received, and outputs the WCDMA diversity baseband signal to a WCDMA diversity modem 998 if the WCDMA diversity baseband signal is received.<br>
The GSM modem 994 demodulates the received GSM baseband signal. The WCDMA diversity modem 998 demodulates the received WCDMA diversity baseband signal.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to detailed embodiments thereof, various changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, while an example in which a combined receiver receiving a WCDMA 1900MHz signal and a PCS 1900MHz signal together and a combined receiver receiving a WCDMA850MHz signal and a GSM850MHz signal together are used has been described in a preferred embodiment of the invention, 'signals of the same frequency band for different services, i.e.,¦different ^wireless interface standards, in the invention are not limited to the specific signals described above. Therefore, the scope of the invention is defined not by the detailed description of the<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000743<br>
RO/KR 13.05.2005 -41 -<br>
invention but by the appended claims and details.<br>
As described above, in a multimode/multiband mobile station according to an embodiment of the present invention, power consumption of software-defined radio (SDR) processing components can be reduced without requiring a high processing rate of digital intermediate frequency (DIF) receiver components, and a sampling rate at an intermediate frequency (IF) can be lowered with maintaining a digital signal processing (DSP) function at an IF level.<br>
For a multimode/multiband mobile station according to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to design a broadband image rejection (IR) mixer at an RF analog front end of each receiver to satisfy multiple frequency bands with low current consumption. In addition, there is a possibility of configuring a digital IF filter, and a digital IF section can operate at a relatively low sampling rate, thereby reducing the current consumption.<br>
In a multimode/multiband mobile station according to an embodiment of the present invention, the number of receivers can be reduced by using one combined receiver of the same frequency band for different services. In addition, the multimode/multiband mobile station can use a duplexer of the conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) technique (e.g., WCDMA) in a time division duplex (TDD) technique (e.g., GSM850 or PCS1900).<br>
A multimode/multiband mobile station according to an embodiment of the present invention can be implemented with less mixers by using combined mixers, one for receivers of a main reception band and the other for receivers of a sub reception band.<br><br>
