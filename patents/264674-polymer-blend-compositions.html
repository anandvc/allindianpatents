				<td>POLYMER BLEND COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Compositions having a polymer blend are disclosed herein<br>
[0002] Polymer blends are widely employed in a range of applications For example, substitution of metal parts with parts made from plastic materials (polymer compositions) results m parts having lighter weight and similar or improved performance properties In many applications, such as parts used under an automobile hood, plastic matenals with a high heat resistance are required Frequently though, plastic materials having a high heat resistance are difficult to mold Blending polymers is one approach to achievmg a plastic matenal with a desired set of physical properties such as high heat resistance and processabihty Polymer blends may comprise miscible polymers, immiscible polymers, or a combination of miscible and immiscible polymers Blends comprising immiscible polymers have two or more phases and such blends may be compatible or mcompatible Incompatible blends of immiscible polymers can suffer from phase separation as demonstrated by delamination or the formation of skin-core layered structures during polymer processing operations, especially injection molding The term, "delamination," as used when referring to such materials, descnbes visually observed separation of a surface layer giving a flaking or onion skm effect Incompatibility may also result in poor mechanical properties and marginal surface appearance (streaking, pearlescence, etc) Compatible blends of immiscible polymers typically do not show any delamination and can result in acceptable end-use properties<br>
[0003] Miscible polymer blends, on the other hand, may offer desirable end-use properties and the advantage of tailoring product properties intermediate of the individual components across the miscible composition range Miscible blends do not suffer from delamination and generally have consistent physical properties<br>
[0004] So while a miscible blend of two polymers is generally desirable it can be difficult to achieve Blends of two polymers of a same or similar class might be expected to have a better chance of miscibility However, polymers from the same class are frequently immiscible and form multiphasic compositions For example, ACUDEL 2000 from Solvay is an immiscible blend of two polysulfones - PPSU and PSU In addition, many such examples of immiscible blends of polymers in the same class exist in the literature Thus, polymer miscibility is difficult to predict, even within the same class of polymers<br>
[0005] For the foregoing reasons there remams an unmet need for non-delaminated polymer blends, l e , blends free of delamination, which are either miscible blends or immiscible, but nonetheless compatible, blends More particularly, there remains an unmet need to develop blends havmg high heat resistance, and methods of forming such polymer blends<br>

 [0031] The term oxydiphthalic anhydndes includes denvatives of oxydiphthalic anhydrides which may also be used to make the pre-polymer Examples of oxydiphthalic anhydnde derivatives which can function as a chemical equivalent for the oxydiphthalic anhydnde in polyethenmide formmg reactions include oxydiphthalic anhydnde derivatives of the formula (VIII)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 and R2 of formula VIII can be, independently at each occurrence, any of the following hydrogen, a C1-C8 alkyl group, an aryl group R1 and R2 can be the same or different to produce an oxydiphthahc anhydride acid, an oxydiphthalic anhydride ester, and an oxydiphthahc anhydride acid ester<br>
[0032] Derivatives of oxydiphthahc anhydrides may also be of the following formula (IX)<br>

wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 of formula (IX) can be, independently at each occurrence, any of the following hydrogen, a C1-C8 alkyl group, an aryl group R1, R2, R3, and R4 can be the same or different to produce an oxydiphthahc acid, an oxydiphthahc ester, and an oxydiphthahc acid ester<br>
[0033] Diamino diaryl sulfones (DAS) have the general formula (X)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Ar1 and Ar2 independently are an aryl group containing a single or multiple rings Several aryl rings may be linked together, for example through ether linkages, sulfone linkages or more than one sulfone linkages The aryl rmgs may also be fused In one embodiment Ar1 and Ar2 mdependently compnse 5 to 12 carbons In one embodiment Ar1 and Ar2 are both phenyl groups<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, the pre-polymer is an ODPA/DAS polyethenmide comprising more than 1, specifically 10 to 1000, or, more specifically, 30 to 500 structural units of formula (XI)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Ar1 and Ar2 are defined as above<br>
[0035] In one embodiment, the pre-polymer has a total reactive end group concentration of 0 5 to 20 mole% resin Reactive end groups are defined as anhydrides and their chemical equivalents and amines In some embodiments, a pre-polymer has a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 100,000 grams per mole (g/mole) as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)<br>
[0036] The pre-polymer can have different ratios of carbon (C) atoms to non-carbon atoms such as nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) For instance, in one embodiment, the pre-polymer can have a ratio of C atoms/N+O+S atoms of 2 8 to 4 2 In one embodiment, the number of oxygen atoms is greater than or equal to 2 5 times the number of nitrogen atoms In another embodiment, the number of oxygen atoms is 2 5 to 5 0 times more than the number of nitrogen atoms In another embodiment, the number of<br>

[0037] The pre-polymer may be made by any suitable process, such as the process descnbed inUS Patent Number 4,835,249 In this method, reactant monomers are dissolved in a solvent and then polymerized to an extent where the polymer precipitates from solution and can eventually be isolated by filtration or other related separation technique<br>
[0038] When the pre-polymer is an ODPA/DAS pre-polymer the pre-polymer is made usmg a slurry/precipitation method comprising stirring a diamine and a dianhydride m a solvent to form a slurry, heatmg the slurry to a temperature sufficient for the diamine and dianhydride to react wherem the temperature is below the meltmg point of the dianhydride, below the meltmg pomt of the diamine, or below the meltmg points of the dianhydride and diamine, and reacting the diamine and dianhydride to form a polyethenmide having sufficient molecular weight to precipitate from the solvent<br>
[0039] In the above process, it is important that the reaction temperature is kept below the meltmg pomt of the minimally soluble monomers so that the polymers precipitate as fine powder from the slurry that is easily stirred It can be useful to remove water, or other volatile by-products from the reaction mixture by distillation or other means In one embodiment azeotropic distillation of water is employed In some embodiments water can be removed by chemical absorption using, for example, molecular sieves In other instances water can be removed usmg a stream of a gas, for example nitrogen, passing over or through the reaction mixture In addition, a combination of two or more water removal methods may be employed<br>
[0040] In one embodiment, the polymerization is conducted entirely below the melting point of the minimally soluble monomer(s) This may be useful when the boiling point temperature of the solvent and the meltmg pomt of the minimally soluble monomer(s) are greater than 100 °C, to allow removal of water from the polymerization<br>
reaction at atmospheric pressure<br>
[0041] It can be useful to conduct the polymerization under pressure, for example at 1 to 300 pounds per square inch (psi) (21 1 kilograms force per square centimeter (kgf/cm2)), or, more specifically, 1 psi (0 070 kgf/cm2) to 100 psi (7 0 kgf/cm2) This can be done for a variety of reasons, one bemg to raise reaction temperature and mcrease the rate of imidization In order to prevent sticking or clumping of the precipitated polymer it is still important to maintain temperature below the melting point of the mmimally soluble monomer(s) even when pressure is increased In some embodiments, it may be useful to remove water from the reaction while pressure is maintained at atmospheric pressure In some embodiments it can be useful to remove water in a multi step process employing pressures greater than or equal to atmospheric pressure<br>
[0042] After the consumption of equal to or greater than 50 weight percent (wt%) of the initial charge of the monomers it can be useful m some embodiments to isolate the precipitated polymer In other embodiments the precipitated polymer may be isolated when equal to or greater than 90 wt% of the initial charge of monomers are consumed This can be done usmg a variety of methods, for example, filtration, centnfugation, floatation, freeze-drying, and combinations compnsmg one or more of the foregoing methods In some embodiments equal to or greater than 95 wt% of the isolated precipitated polyethenmide, based on the total weight of the isolated precipitated polyethenmide, passes through a 2 millimeter (mm) mesh screen In some embodiments the isolated precipitated polyethenmide is a free flowing powder with an average particle size of 10 to 5000 micrometers<br>
[0043] The solvent used to form the slurry is chosen such that one or more of the initial monomers is minimally soluble "Minimally soluble" is defined as 1 to 50 wt% of the monomer is undissolved at the start of the reaction (at the initial reaction conditions) In addition, the solvent should be chosen such that the resultant polymer is largely insoluble, that is to have a polymer solubility of less than or equal to 10 wt %, or, even more specifically, less than or equal to 5 wt%, or, even more specifically, less than or<br>
equal to 1 wt % In some embodiments the solvent compnses an aprotic polar solvent In some embodiments, the solvent is insoluble in water, that is less than or equal to 5 wt%, or, more specifically, less than or equal to 1 wt%, based on the total amount of solvent, of the solvent dissolves in an equal amount of water at room temperature In some embodiments, the solvent has a high auto ignition temperature, for example greater than or equal to 70 °C, to reduce the potential fire hazard during the process and during any subsequent isolation<br>
[0044] In addition, a solvent free of nitrogen atoms, phosphorus atoms, sulfur atoms or a combmation comprising two or more of the foregomg may be useful m some embodiments Solvents without these more polar atoms may be easier to remove from the polymer and being less effective solvents are more likely to have monomers and polymers that are minimally soluble or insoluble<br>
[0045] Examples of useful solvents for forming the pre-polymer include halogenated aromatics, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene and bromobenzene, aryl ethers such as phenetole, anisole and veratrole, alkylaromatics such as xylenes and toluene, nitro aromatics such as nitrobenzene, polyaryl species such as naphthylene and alkyl substituted fused aromatic systems, aryl sulfone, high molecular weight alkane compounds such as mineral oils, and combinations comprising one or more of the foregomg solvents In some embodiments the solvent or combmation of solvents has an atmospheric boiling pomt of 150 to 250 °C<br>
[0046] The reaction to form the pre-polymer may be run at any level of reactants versus solvent In some mstances the weight % solids can be 5 to 50 % by weight of reactants to solvent at the start of the polymerization reaction In other mstances, concentrations of 15 to 40% by weight may be useful In still other instances higher concentrations of reactants to solvent may be used to gam reactor efficiency<br>
[0047] Polyethenmide pre-polymer may be made usmg the precipitative process by reaction of more or less equal molar amounts of dianhydnde (or chemical equivalent of a dianhydnde) with a diamine In some embodiments the amount of dianhydnde and diamine differ by less than 5 mole%, this helps to give polymers of sufficient molecular weight (Mw), for example greater than or equal to 1,000 g/mol, to precipitate from the reaction medium and have useful mechanical properties such as stiffness, impact strength and resistance to tearing or cracking<br>
[0048] Polyethenmide polymers and polyethenmide pre-polymers may have varying levels of amme and anhydnde end groups depending on the amounts of diamine and dianhydnde used in the polymenzation reaction and the degree of completeness of the polymerization reaction A vanety of amine, anhydnde, and anhydride denvatives such as carboxyhc acids, carboxylate salts, amide-acids and amide-carboxylate salts are examples of possible end groups As used herein it will be understood that the term "amme end groups" compnses end groups that are amines, and any related end groups that are denved from amine end groups As used herein it will also be understood that the term "anhydnde end groups" comprises end groups which are anhydndes and anhydnde derivatives such as carboxyhc acid, carboxylate salts, amide-acids and amide-carboxylate salts All types, more than one type or essentially one type of these end groups may be present In general, total reactive end group concentrations of a polyethenmide can be 0 05 to 0 3 mole% resin In contrast, the total reactive end group concentrations of a pre-polymer can be 0 5 to 20 mole% As used herein, the term "reactive end group" refers to any of the vanous possible end groups that can give nse to volatile species dunng melt processmg Most reactive end groups will be amme or anhydride In one embodiment, the pre-polymer has a total reactive end group content of 1 to 10 mole%, or, more specifically, 5 to 10 mole%<br>

Discussion<br>
[0084] Examples 1-3 (which are based on pre-polymers) when compared to Comparative Example 4 (which is not based on a pre-polymer) show the unexpected behavior of polyethenmide blends when a pre-polymer was used to make the blends Blends of PEI 1 and PEI 3 exhibited two phase morphology and delammation even at low levels of PEI 3 (15 weight %) In contrast, despite the two phase resm morphology, blends of pre-polymer and PEI 3, even at 40 weight %, did not show delammation after heat aging at 280°C for 240 hours Surprisingly, melt mixmg with a reactive pre-polymer overcame the problem of delammation in an immiscible, incompatible blend and resulted m an immiscible, but compatible blend of practical importance<br>
[0085] Examples 5-7 (which are based on pre-polymers) when compared to Comparative Examples 8 and 9 (which are not based on pre-polymers) illustrated the unexpected behavior of polyethenmide blends when a pre-polymer was used to make the blends Blends of PEI 1 and PEI 2 showed two phase morphology at low levels of PEI 2<br>
(15 weight %)  Despite the multiphasic resin morphology, the blends of PEI1 and PEI2 did not show any delamination In contrast, blends of pre-polymer and PEI 2 showed a monophasic morphology with a single Tg at the same levels of PEI 2 (15 weight%) and even at a high level of PEI 2 (40 weight%) No delamination after heat aging at 280°C for 240 hours was observed in any of these blends<br>
[0086] The blend of Example 7 also demonstrated excellent properties More particularly, the blend of Example 7 exhibited tensile strength of 120 MPa, flexural strength of 170 MPa, HDT of 240°C under a load of 1 8MPa, and a coefficient of thermal expansion of 45 ppm/°C from 30-200°C<br>
