				<td>The present invention relates to a benzimidazo[2,1-b]benzazepine compound<br>
The invention concerns a novel histamine receptor antagonist and the use of an histamine receptor antagonist for the reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP), in particular for the prevention and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and/or secondary ischaemia, in particular caused by brain injury, more in particular caused by traumatic (TBI) and non-traumatic brain injury.<br>
TBI is a significant problem in developed countries. In the USA each year about 500,000 head injuries are severe enough to require hospitalisation. Mortality is high, and approximately 80,000 of these TBI-patients face a life-long debilitating loss of function, 5,000 develop epilepsy and 2,000 live in a persistent vegetative state. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in young adults today at an estimated cost in 1989 of over $25 billion per year.<br>
Primary irreversible damage after brain trauma includes hemorrhage, contusion, neuronal necrosis and diffuse axonal injury. This damage, together with possible cardiovascular and respiratory depression, can induce acute secondary features including edema (vasogenic and/or cellular), secondary bleeding, alterations of cerebral blood volume (CB V), disturbed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ischaemia. Edema, bleeding and an increase of CBV will increase the total brain volume and consequently the intracranial pressure (ICP). This in turn can lead to further progression of ischaemia, infarction, and, in severe cases, herniation of the brain stem with possible acute respiratory depression and death. Therapy in TBI should therefore be directed to the interruption of the pathologic cascade and the reduction of the brain volume and ICP. Prevention of a life threatening secondary increase in ICP, which often occurs e.g. in the post-acute phase after trauma or after cardiac resuscitation, is also a target for pharmacological treatment.<br>
At present, the clinical tools for ICP reduction are limited. Standard treatment schedules include surgical drainage of the ventricles, blood pressure management,<br><br><br>

mannitol infusion, hyperventilation and high dose barbiturate therapy. Side effects of the non-surgical treatments include brain ischaemia, rebound effects on ICP and an (Figure Removed)<br>
increased risk for bacterial infections and sepsis. Also, various compounds with different mechanisms of actions (e.g. bradykinin antagonism, calcium antagonism, oxidative stress inhibition, glutamate receptor blockade and anti-epilepsy) have been tested in phase II and III clinical trials or are still under investigation (focus on outcome, not on ICP). Up to date no compound has been approved for the acute treatment of intracranial pressure (K.K. Jain, Chapter 4 : Neuroprotection in Acute Trauma, 'Neuroprotection in CNS Disorders: Commercial Opportunities'. A Jain PharmaBiotech Report : 65-73, 2000). Obviously, there is a need for pharmaceuticals and/or therapies for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or secondary ischaemia, in particular caused by brain injury, more in particular caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI).<br>
The inventors have now found that substituted tetracyclic imidazole derivatives according to the general Formula (I) show histamine HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonist activity. Furthermore, the compounds have been shown to be particular useful for the reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP), in particular for the prevention and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and/or secondary ischaemia, in particular caused by brain injury, more in particular caused by traumatic (TBI) and non-traumatic brain injury.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have found that compounds that antagonize the histamine HI- and/or H2-receptors (commonly called anti-histaminics) are also usefull for the reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP), in particular for the prevention and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and/or secondary ischaemia, in particular caused by brain injury, more in particular caused by traumatic (TBI) and non-traumatic brain injury.<br>
Characteristical to all compounds is that they are able to acutely reduce the intracranial pressure when administered to the bloodstream of a mamal, in particular by intraveneous administration. Advantageously and very important, said compounds<br>
reduce the ICP while having little or no effect on the blood pressure, in particular a blood pressure-lowering effect, which is a most desired property of a potential drug.<br>
Hithertoo, histamine HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonists have not been developed for lowering the ICP, in particular for post-traumatic lowering of the ICP. Mohanty et al. in Journal of the Neurological Sciences. 1989,90:87-97 observed that histamine played a role in the forming of traumaticaly induced brain edema. Increased brain water content and elevated plasma and brain histamine levels -wets prevented by prior treatment with the histamine H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine. However, meypyramine (an histamine HI-receptor antagonist) failed to reduce the increased brain water content and the histamine levels in the plasma and brain remained high. The effect on the ICP, in particular the action of histamine antagonists after a rise of the ICP for acutely reducing an increased ICP was not researched nor was the effect on the blood pressure.<br>
Without being restricted theretoo, it is the opinion of the inventors that, in view of the fact that the histamine receptor antagonists show the ability to reduce a normal ICP in the absence of brain edema and in view of the fact that the histamine receptor antagonists do not or only marginally influence the blood pressure, an effect attributed to peripheral vasodilatation, the mechanism of action is not one that acts purely on the reduction of brain edema nor via vasodilation, effects which are known in the prior art to occur for anti-histaminics.<br>
Hence, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a substituted tetracyclic imidazole derivatives for use as an histamine antagonist, in particular as an histamine HI-antagonist, more in particular as an antagonist showing both histamine HI- and H2-antagonist activity, according to the general Formula (I)Fhe pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the<br>

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to Formula (I) are able to form. Said acid addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulruric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfomc acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>

The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates which the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
Among the acid addition salts, the compound 3-[2-[4-(l l,12-dihydro-6#-benzimidazo [2,1-6] [3]benzazepin-6-yl)-2-(phenylmethyl)-l -piperidinyl]ethyl]-2,10-dimethyl pyrimido[l,2-a]benzimidazol-4(10#)-°ne (E)-2-butenedioate (2:3) hydrate (1:1) including all stereoisomeric forms thereof is the most preferred compound.<br>
Particulary preferred compounds are the (A)[(2ot, 4/3)(A)] enantiomer, the<br>
(B)[(2a, 4/3)(A)] enantiomer and a mixture thereof, of the compounds<br>
3-[2-[4-(l 1,12-dihydro-6ff-benzimidazo[2,1 -b] [3]benzazepin-6-yl)-2-(phenylmethyl)-<br>

butenedioate (2:3) hydrate (1:1).<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide, particularly those A/-oxides wherein one or more nitrogens of the piperidinyl radical in Formula (1) are TV-oxidized.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used herein defines all possible isomeric forms which the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R*,R*] indicates centers with the same chirality and [.K*,.?&gt;*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as iS-[JZ* 5*]. If "a" and "/3" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "/3", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
When the bond at c is a single bond, compounds of Formula (I) and some of the intermediate compounds have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure. When R1 is other than hydrogen, the monocyclic N-ring in Formula (I) has a further stereogenic center. This may lead to 8 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formiila (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable cliiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
Some of the compounds of Formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invemtion. For instance, compounds of Formula (I) wherein R5 is H may exist in their corresponding tautomeric form.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the JV-oxide form thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COORX, where Rx is a l, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, l, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, d-ealkyl, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an aniino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) can generally be prepared by a succession of steps, each of which is known to the skilled person. The preparation of said compounds is disclosed in a co-pending application, which is included herein by reference.<br>
Apart form their use for reducing the ICP, the compounds according to Formula (I) and derivatives thereof are also useful for the treatment of other histamine HI- and H2-mediated diseases, in particular for immunomodulation in a mamal, for the suppression of hypersensitivity and/or inflammatory reactions, for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases such as rhinitis, urticaria, asthma, anaphylaxis and the likeand for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers, dyspepsia, various reflux indications and the like. The invention is therefor also concerned with the use of an histamine receptor antagonist according to Formula (I) and derivatives thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for immunomodulation in a mamal, for the suppression<br>
of hypersensitivity and/or inflammatory reactions and for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases and gastrointestinal conditions.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is to provide for a new use for histamine HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonists, in particular for acutely lowering the intracranial pressure (ICP), in particular an elevated ICP, more in particular a critically elevated ICP and/or preventing an elevated ICP and secondary ischaemia caused by brain injury. Most advantageously, the histamine HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonists do not or to a minimum extend lower or raise the blood pressure.<br>
According to the invention, the histamine HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonists are either compounds and derivatives thereof according to Formula (I) or blown histamine Hl-and/or H2-receptor antagonists, being a discrete and limited group of medications readily recognized in the art.<br>
Hithertoo, histamine HI-receptor antagonists are commonly used for immunomodulation in a mamal and for the suppression of hypersensitivity and/or inflammatory reactions. In particular, the histamine Hl-receptor antagonist is selected from the group of acrivastine, alimemazine, antazoline, astemizole, azatadine, azelastine, brompheniramine, buclizine, carbinoxamine, carebastine, cetirizine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, cinnarizine, clemastine, clemizole, clocinizine, clonidine, cyclizine, cyproheptadine, descarboethoxyloratidine, dexchlorpheniramine, dimenhydrinate, dimethindene, dimethothiazine, diphenhydramine, diphenylpyraline, doxylamine, ebastine, efletirizine, epinastine, fexofenadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, levocabastine, loratidine, meclizine, mequitazine, methdilazine, mianserin, mizolastine, niaprazine, noberastine, norastemizole, oxatomide, oxomemazine, phenbenzamine, pheniramine, picumast, promethazine, pyrilamine, temelastine, terfenadine, trimeprazhie, tripelennamine and triprolidine, derivatives thereof and mixtures of any two or more of the foregoing.<br>
Hithertoo, histamine H2-receptor antagonists are commonly used for mamals suffering from certain gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers, dyspepsia, various reflux indications and the like. In particular, the histamine H2-receptor antagonist is selected<br>
firom the group of ranitidine, cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, tiotidine, zolantidine, derivatives thereof and mixtures of any two or more of the foregoing.<br>
Also, histamine receptor antagonists may exhibit both histaminic HI- and/or H2-receptor antagonist activity, such as ritanserine or the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof.<br>
While all compounds show a marked depression of the ICP, the following compounds have been shown also to have no or little effect on the lowering of the blood pressure : ketotifen, chlorcyclizine, promethazine, pyrilamine, diphenylhydramine, chlorpheniramine and zolantadine.<br>
In vitro studies can be used to evaluate the histamine antagonist activity of the present compounds using appropriate receptor modelling studies.<br>
In vivo studies can be used to evaluate the biological activity of the present compounds. To this extent, a clinically relevant rat model for traumatic brain injury (Closed Head Injury-model) was developed and used to test the compounds according to the invention (K. Engelborghs et al., Temporal changes in intracranialpressure in a modified experimental model of closed head injury, J. Neurosurg. 89: 796-806, 1998 ; K. van Rossem et al., Brain oxygenation after experimental closed head injury, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 471: 209-215, 1999 ; K. Engelborghs et al., Impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in an experimental model of traumatic brain injury, L Neurotrauma. 17(8): 667-677,2000). In one study intracranial hypertension was induced by a cortical cold lesion in rabbits.<br>
The bistamine receptor antagonist according to the invention, including the compounds according to Formula (I) and the currently known histamine HI-, H2- and H1/H2-receptor antagonists may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular  <br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. Most preferably, -for ease of quick administration - the aforementioned pharmaceutical composition is formulated as an injectable or perfusable solution or suspension.<br>

Experimental part<br>
Of some compounds the absolute stereochemical configuration of the stereogenic carbon atom(s) therein was not experimentally determined. In those cases the stereochemically isomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" isomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by a person skilled in the art, using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br><br>
For example, for the compound pyrimido[l,2-a]benzimidazol-4(10F)-one, 3-[2-[4-(ll,12-dihydro-6//-benzimidazo[2,l-ft][3]benzazepin-6-yl)-2-(phenylmethyl)-l-piperidinyl]ethyl]-2,10-dimethyl, the 8 possible stereochemical isomeric forms are 15     defined as follows ;<br>

(Figure Removed)Radioligand receptor binding studies were performed in vitro for radioligand binding ofthe selected compounds using a preparation of a tissue which was enriched in a particular receptor, i.e. the histamine HI- or H2-receptor. For the<br>
eceptor, the tissue used were CHO-cells, permanently transfected with the human histamine HI -receptor. Only diphenhydramine was tested against guinea pig cells from the cerebral cortex . Competitive inhibition of [3H] Pyrilamine by the tested compounds was conducted by incubating a low (nM) concentration of the radioligand with a small sample of the tissue preparation (0.2-5 ml; 1-5 mg tissue) in a buffered medium and various concentrations of the compounds, dissolved in DMSO, spanning at least 4 orders of magnitutude around the pICso value, derived from the inhibition curve. The histaminic H2-antagonist activity was tested in much the same way as the histaminic HI-antagonist activity, using guinea pig striatum cells and [125I]APT as the radioligand in a concentration of 0.1 nM. Incubation was done during 150 min at 22°C.<br>

Several compounds showed a pICso value of 6 or more for histaminic HI-antagonist activity. These compounds are listed in Table 9. Furthermore is observed that a commercially available typical histamine HI-antagonist (diphenhydramine) exhibits only a slighty higher histaminic HI-antagonist activity as the bulk of the compounds according to our invention. Furthermore is shown that the commercially available H2-antagonists (ranitidine and cimetidine) exhibit histamine H2-activities in the range of the (moderately high) H2-activities of the compounds according to our invention. A selection of the compounds in Table 9, including commercially available compounds, was also tested in in vivo experiments for their ability to reduce ICP.<br>

RC.2. In vivo pharmacology Closed Head Injury (CHD Model<br>
A clinically relevant rat model for traumatic brain injury was used to test the compounds according to the invention and the commercially available compounds. This model mimics several clinical features of traumatic brain injury, such as increased ICP, decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, morphologic alterations including diffuse axonal injury, neuronal necrosis and contusion, impairment of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and reduction of brain oxygenation and was applied for screening drugs with ICP-lowering effects. Trauma was induced hi intubated, isofiurane anesthetized (1.5% isofiurane in a mixture of 30 % 62 and 70 % N2O) Sprague-Dawley rats (380-400 g) stereotaxically positioned on a table mounted on 4 springs. A 400 g steel cylinder, protected with a 9 mm diameter silicon disc, was dropped on the unprotected skull from a height of either 70 cm or 50 cm (respectively 'severe' and 'moderate' head injury). The impact area was centered between bregma and lamda. ICP was recorded using a Codman microsensor probe inserted in the parietal cortex. In both severe and moderate head injuries the ICP increased immediately after trauma and remained elevated for several days. The severe head injury mode was used for the evaluation of pharmacological effects immediately after trauma (screening procedure). When survival and recovery from anesthesia was envisaged, the moderate head injury mode was applied. In pharmacological studies, animals with a pathological ICP between 12.5 and 35 mm Hg were included. The changes in ICP, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cerebral perfusion pressure CPP (HVIABP-CPP) were expressed as percentage of the initial value at onset of the treatment,<br>
Screening procedure for the compounds according to the invention On a weekly base, 4 treated groups of 3 rats were compared with 3 saline treated animals. Since conventional statistical methods require a larger amount of animals, a sequential procedure was used. Sequential methods operate in different stages. At each stage, a group of animals was selected as homogeneous as possible. Animals were randomly allocated to either drugs or saline. The procedure allowed to make the decision of rejecting the drug, accepting the drug as active or to continue with a new group of animals hi a next stage. Given the biological relevant level of activity that must be detected, the expected fraction of false positive and negative results was<br>
(1)	known and fixed. A sequential two-sample grouped rank test was used. A three stage sequential design with a relatively small number of animals at each stage showed to be optimal. Despite the variability in the individual data, the procedure consistently accepted reference treatments such as mannitol as active, while controls were rejected. Clinically relevant i.v. doses of mannitol (3 g over 45 min) consistently reduced the ICP (mean reduction about 20 %).<br>

Further studies<br>
Table 11 shows the changes in some relevant physiological variables recorded during treatment after severe CHI in rats. Treatment was started at 20 min after severe head injury and involved administering a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/min during 10 minutes, followed by 0.1 mg/kg/min during 50 min.<br>

Compound 1: (B)[(2a, 4/3)(A)] Compound 2 : (A)[(2a, 4/3)(A)] Racemate (comp. 1 and comp. 2): (2a, 4/3)(A), i.e. the racemic mixture of Compound 1 and<br>
Compound 2<br>
ICP: Intracranial pressure MABP : Mean arterial blood pressure CPP : Cerebral perfusion pressure ETCOj: End tidal CO2<br>
The significant effect of compound 2 on MABP is much less pronounced when the compound is given at a continuous infusion of 0.1 mg/kg.min. In this case a blood pressure peak is not present and increases in MABP larger than 20 % are not observed (median MABP increase at the end of the infusion is 9 %, n=6). The maximal reduction of ICP at this dose is comparable to the one observed when the infusion is preceded by the 'loading dose' of 5 mg/kg over 10 min, but the time required to obtain this effect is longer (median: 30 min).<br>
Effect of ranitidine and diphenhvdramine on the ICP<br>
Ranitidine was infused for 6 min at a dose of 2 mg/kg/min in the rat CHI-model after inflicting severe head injury. Solvent (NaCl + H2T) was given at the same rate. In each group, 6 rats were treated. Ranitidine was observed to yield a statistically significant larger reduction in ICP than in the solvent-treated group (7.7 % versus 0.5% reduction, which was significant at p=0.013). The percentage of reduction are calculated as % change of the ICP recorded at the onset of the treatment and at the end of the infusion. No significant change in blood pressure was observed.<br>
Diphenhydramine was infused for 10 min at a dose of 1 mg/kg/min in the rat CHI-model after inflicting severe head injury. Three rats were treated. Diphenhydramine was observed to yield a 34 % reduction in ICP without any significant effect on the blood pressure.<br>
Comparative experiments with agonists,<br>
For comparison, two commercially available EC-agonists (dimaprit and impromidine) were also tested by infusion into non-traumatized rats, using a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/rnin for 10 minutes for dimaprit and increasing doses up to 3.75 mg/kg/hour for impromidine. No effects were observed. When dimaprit was dosed at the high dose of 2 mg/kg/min for 10 minutes, and impromidine was doses as a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg blood pressure anc ICP were observed to drop, but recovered after the treatment.<br>
It was therefor concluded that histamine HI-and/or H2-receptor antagonists exhibited the effect of lowering the ICP and having in the meantime hardly any significant effect on the blood pressure.<br>
Experiments with commercially available HI- and H2-antaeonists A number of commercially available HI- and H2-antagonists was infused for 10 min at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/min in the rat CHI-model after inflicting severe head injury. Solvent (NaCl + H2T) was given at the same rate. In each group, 6 rats were treated. The results of the behavior of the ICP and BP in the first 15 minutes are summarized in Table 12.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Results of a blinded, completely randomized study of the effect of a 10 min infusion of Compound 1 at different doses (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg/min) in the rat CHI model indicate that during treatment Compound 1 invokes a sustained dose-dependent decrease of ICP (Figure 1). Starting at 1 mg/kg/min Compound 1 yields a statistically significant larger reduction in ICP than in the solvent-treated group. In the 10 min<br>
period following tlie infusion a highly significant dose-dependent effect on ICP remains present (Figure 2).<br>
Effects of Compound 2, Compound 1 and Racemate fComp. 1 and Comp. 2 on brain hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation.<br>
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the rat brain 'in vivo' allows to quantify non-invasively saturation of brain haemoglobin with oxygen (HbSat) and total brain haemoglobin concentration ([HbTot]). The latter is a measure for cerebral blood volume (CBV). Changes in the redox state of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase (CytOx), an indicator for tissue oxygenation, can also be monitored.<br>
All compounds 2,1 and the racemate (Comp. 1 and Comp. 2) do not have a significant effect on [HbTot] when given 24 h after moderate head injury at a i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg.min during 10 min, followed by 0.1 mg/kg.min during 45 min. Only compound 2 induces a small but statistically significant reduction of HbSat. HbSat is not affected by compound 1 and the racemate (Comp. 1 and Comp. 2). At the applied dose all compounds do not have an effect on the redox state of CytOx. These results indicate that in the applied experimental conditions a vasoconstrictive effect on cerebral blood vessels, if present, is limited and tissue oxygenation is not jeopardised.<br>
Influence of anaesthesia on the effects of Compound 2<br>
The effects of treatment with Compound 2 (i.v. infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.min during 30 min) at 24 h after moderate trauma were studied using different anesthetics (isoflurane, chloralhydrate, pentobarbital). When chloralhydrate (400 mg/kg i.p) is used as anesthetic, ICP decreases to 75% of initial value and MABP gradually increases to 110% of initial value (medians, n=6). These effects are comparable with those observed under isoflurane anesthesia. When pentobarbital (60 mg/kg i.p.) is used, Compound 2 induces a significant gradual increase in MABP up to 141 % of initial value at the end of the infusion, whereas ICP decreases to 64% of initial value (medians, n=6). These results indicate that the same pattern of effects on ICP and MABP are observed under various types of anesthesia. The fact that the compound reduces the ICP significantly under pentobarbital anesthesia is important, as barbiturates are often applied in<br>
traumatic brain injury patients. Barbiturates also reduce the ICP .and an important additional effect can be obtained with the compound.<br>
The effect of repeated application of Compound 1 and of mannitol on elevated ICP in<br>
traumatized rats.<br>
Compound 1 was given 2 times with intermittent periods of 20 min at a i.v. dose of 1<br>
mg/kg/min during 10 min, starting a first time 20 min after induction of severe head<br>
injury.<br>
Mannitol was given i.v. in the same time windows as Compound 1 at a dose of 0.125<br>
g/kg/min. The control animals received the solvent (containing 10 % HP-P-CD, pH 4)<br>
only.<br>
Infusion with Compound 1 results in rapid reduction of ICP (Figure 3). This effect is<br>
amplified after termination of each infusion period. Blood pressure drops during<br>
Compound 1 treatment but is restored again after this episode. This is in contrast with<br>
mannitol, that induces a lowering of ICP and an increase in blood pressure during each<br>
infusion followed by a decrease in blood pressure after termination of each treatment.<br>
Only in the Compound 1- treated animals a clear dissociation between the changes in<br>
blood pressure and ICP can be observed. In contrast, the mannitol treated animals<br>
exhibit more or less parallel changes in blood pressure and intracranial pressure. This<br>
indicates that the pharmacological effect of Compound 1 is different from that of<br>
mannitol.<br>
Effect of Compound 1 on cold lesion-induced rise of ICP in rabbits<br>
Cryo-lesions were induced in adult rabbits to obtain a pathological ICP that is caused<br>
by tissue oedema. A 8 mm stainless steel rod was placed at predetermined coordinates<br>
on the exposed skull of deeply anaesthetised rabbits and cooled for 10 min with liquid<br>
nitrogen. One day later the animals were re-anaesthetised and ICP and blood pressure<br>
continuously recorded as described for the rat. After a stabilisation period of 15 min,<br>
Compound 1 was infused for 10 min at a dose of 2 mg/kg/min. Solvent (preclinical<br>
formulation containing 10% HP-P-CD, pH 4) was given for 10 min at a rate of 2<br>
ml/min.<br>
During infusion of the Compound 1, the blood pressure drops and although there is no<br>
immediate decrease in ICP, the ICP rise that is observed in the solvent-treated animals<br>
tends to be antagonised (Figure 4). When drug infusion is terminated, blood pressure comes back to the initial value and a significant ICP reduction is seen that persists during the entire recording period.<br>
These results indicate that the compound reduces the ICP also in non-rodent species and in pathologic conditions different from closed head injury.<br>
The effect of Compound 1 and on ICP in non-traumatized animals.<br>
Rats<br>
The effect of Compound 2, Compound 1 and Racemate (comp. 1 and comp. 2) on ICP,<br>
MABP and CPP was tested in anaesthetised non-traumatised rats. The compounds were<br>
administered i.v. and the same dose was given as in traumatized rats (0.5 mg/kg/min<br>
during 10 minutes, followed by 0.1 mg/kg/rnin during 50 min). The results were<br>
comparable with those obtained in the traumatized animals.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The results obtained in traumatized animals, animals with cold lesion, and non-traumatized animals indicate that the compounds are active in various conditions, even in normal conditions. Their field of application probably includes various pathological conditions in which intracranial hypertension is present.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
