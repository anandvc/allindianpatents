PROCESS WITH WHICH TO SET A WIPER ANGLE<br>
Prior Art<br>
The invention emanates from a process with which to set a wiper angle according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
The expectation with regard to today's windscreen wiper systems is that they should have the largest possible wiping area, which should preferably cover the entire windscreen. This is achieved in that at least one wiper lever of the windscreen wiper system has a stand-by position or a point of return in the vicinity of the lateral boundary and runs approximately parallel to the same. The lateral boundaries of the windscreen are formed by so-called A-columns of the car body. The wiper lever usually fulfils these conditions on the driver's side of the vehicle.<br>
Moreover, progressively longer wiper levers with progressively longer wiper blades are being used, which gives rise to very large distances to the A-columns in the point of return of the wiper lever as a result of wiper angle tolerances. This means that in the case of a wiper field definition for a wiper lever that is approximately 1000 millimetres long and has a standard wiper angle tolerance of +/-1.5 degrees, an non-wiped area that is 52 millimetres broad is to be taken into consideration, in an unfavourable case, in the region of the A-columns, which leads to problems in the case of today's view field requirements.<br>
In the case of the customary windscreen wiper systems of today, the wiper lever sits with a mounting part on a drive shaft, which is driven by a driving crank and a ball pin as well as a lever mechanism of a wiper motor. Moreover, in the case of established windscreen wiper systems, the ball pin is designed as an eccentric<br><br>
ball pin and is mounted on the driving crank. The wiper angle is then measured at the end of the production line. The effective radius of the driving crank is altered by twisting the eccenter till the wiper angle reaches the required value. The eccentric ball pin is secured afterwards by means of a counter nut.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
According to the invention, the windscreen wiper system is first mounted at the car body without the eccentric ball pin. After this, a rivet spigot of the eccentric ball pin is inserted into a corresponding bore of the driving crank and set according to the optimal wiper angle in that the actual radius between the articulated axis of the eccentric ball pin and the drive shaft's axis is altered by turning the eccentric ball pin around a spigot axis of the rivet spigot. The rivet spigot is eventually affixed in the driving crank. The process in accordance with the invention takes not only tolerances of the individual parts of the windscreen wiper system into consideration but also tolerances conditioned by the vehicle. It is, thereby, possible to achieve wiper angle tolerances of +/- 0.5 degrees.<br>
In accordance with a design of the invention, it is proposed that the rivet spigot of the eccentric ball pin be moulded, caulked or riveted into the driving crank after setting the wiper angle. The part thus becomes simpler and the register nut can be done away with which is more cost-effective on the whole.<br>
There is, moreover, the possibility that the effective radius, with which the eccentric ball pin is set using a setting and caulking device, is determined in a servo loop on the basis of the tolerance position of the wiper angle of the wiper system that has already been built into similar vehicles and the tolerance position of individual parts of the windscreen wiper system. These empirical values permit sufficiently precise conclusions regarding an actual installation case so<br><br>
that a very low wiper angle tolerance can be maintained, even using these methods.<br>
Drawing<br>
Other advantages emanate from the following description of the drawing in which an exemplary embodiment is presented. The drawing, the description and the claims contain numerous features in combination. The expert would appropriately consider the features even individually and compile same into further purposeful combinations.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic set-up of a windscreen wiper system while Figure 2 illustrates a drive shaft with a driving crank and an eccentric ball pin and Figure 3 illustrates an enlargement of the eccentric ball pin.<br>
Description of the Exemplary Embodiment<br>
If required, a windscreen wiper system cleans a windscreen 10 that has two so-called A-columns 12, 14 as lateral boundaries. It has two wiper levers 16, 18 whose wiper blades 20, 22 cover wiping areas 24, 26 on the windscreen 10. In Figure 1, the wiper levers 16, 18 take up a stand-by position in the vicinity of the lower rim of the windscreen 10. During a wiping movement, they cover a wiping angle of cpi, q&gt;2 that extends between the indicated stand-by position and a point of return 28, 30 of the wiper Ievers16, 18.<br>
The wiper levers 16, 18 are driven by a wiper motor 34 through a transmission system 36, an engine crank 38 and a lever transmission system. The drive parts are mounted at a blank 32 that is affixed to the car body. The lever transmission system for the wiper lever 16 on the passenger side of the vehicle includes a toggle link 40 and an engine crank 52 that drives an actuating lever 46 of a four-<br><br>
bar lever mechanism 44. A guide 48 and a coupling element 50 that are connect to the wiper lever 16, are also a part of this. A lifting motion superimposes a swivel motion of the wiper lever 16 through the four-bar lever mechanism 44, so that the wiping area 24 extends relatively far into the upper corner of the windscreen 10 on the passenger's side.<br>
The lever mechanism for the wiper lever 18 on the driver's side comprises of a toggle link 42 that is hinged to a driving crank 54 through an eccentric ball pin 60. This sits in a torque-proof manner on a driving shaft 56 that pivots at a bearing housing that is not illustrated and on which a mounting part 58 of the wiper lever 18 sits. The point of return 30 of the wiper lever 18 lies close to the allocated A-column 14 of the car body and runs in an approximately parallel manner to the same. A wiper angle q&gt;2 is set in order to ensure that the areas between the wiping area 26 and the A-column 14 that are not wiped are not too large and to ensure that the wiper blade does not hit against the A-column 14. For this purpose, the windscreen wiper system is first mounted on the vehicle without the eccentric ball pin 60 and the effective radius 78 (Fig. 2) between an articulated axis 66 of the ball pin 62 and the axis 76 of the drive shaft 56 is then adjusted till the optimal wiper angle of cp2 is achieved. For this purpose the rivet spigot 64, whose spigot axis 68 is moved in a radial manner around an eccentricity 70 and runs parallel to the articulated axis 66, is rotated around the spigot's axis 68. When the correct setting is found, the rivet spigot 64 is fixed relative to the driving crank 54 by advantageously shaping, caulking or riveting the same to this. The ball pin 62 thereby lies with its contact collar 74 at the driving crank 54. The toggle link 42 is hinged to the ball pin 62, whereby the centre of the ball 72 is simultaneously the centre of the articulation.<br>
The eccentric ball pin 60 in Figure 2 is directed to the interior of the vehicle. It can, alternatively, also point outwards. Likewise, the crank 54 that is located in<br><br>
the region of the external end of the drive shaft 56 in Figure 2 can alternatively be provided at the inner end of the drive shaft 56.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
