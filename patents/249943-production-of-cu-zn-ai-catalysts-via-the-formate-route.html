PRODUCTION OF Cu/Zn/Al CATALYSTS<br>
VIA THE FORMATE ROUTE<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing Cu/Zn/A1<br>
catalysts, to a catalyst which can be obtained by the process,<br>
and to its use for methanol synthesis and the reformation of<br>
methanol and the low-temperature conversion of carbon monoxide.<br>
Cu/Zn/A1 catalysts which catalyze the conversion of CO, CO2 and<br>
H2 to methanol have been known for some time. The atomic ratios<br>
between copper and zinc can vary in these known catalysts,<br>
except that copper is generally present in excess. Moreover,<br>
part of the zinc component can be replaced by calcium, magnesium<br>
and/or manganese. The aluminum oxide used as a thermally<br>
stabilizing substance can also be replaced partly by chromium<br>
oxide.<br>
For example, DE 1 965 007 discloses a catalyst for low-<br>
temperature methanol synthesis. For the preparation of the<br>
catalyst, the corresponding basic carbonates are first<br><br>
precipitated from a solution of suitable zinc and copper salts<br>
by adding alkali metal carbonates. The basic carbonates are<br>
removed from the aqueous phase, dried and calcined in order to<br>
obtain the corresponding oxides. The zinc oxides and copper<br>
oxides are subsequently mixed with aluminum oxide to prepare a<br>
suspension of the oxides which contains not more than 20%<br>
solids. This is subsequently homogenized, the homogenization<br>
being performed until the dispersed oxides do not settle out<br>
over the course of 2 hours. After the homogenization, the<br>
mixture is dried, tableted and calcined. In order to convert the<br>
oxidic form to the catalyst, it is then reduced in a hydrogen<br>
stream.<br>
DE 2 302 658 A discloses a process for preparing a precursor for<br>
a catalyst which can be used for methanol synthesis. To prepare<br>
the catalyst precursor, a first precipitate which comprises a<br>
divalent metal, for example zinc, and a trivalent metal, for<br>
example aluminum, is first prepared in the form of a compound<br>
which can be decomposed thermally to the corresponding oxides.<br>
Suitable compounds are, for example, carbonates or bicarbonates.<br>
In addition, a second precipitate which comprises copper<br>
compounds which can be decomposed thermally to oxides is<br>
prepared. The two precipitates are mixed. This is followed by<br>
the customary stages of drying and calcination in order to<br>
obtain the oxides from the metal compounds and possibly to bring<br>
about the formation of a spinel structure. The solid is then<br>
tableted. In order to convert the precursor to an active<br>
catalyst, the tablets are reduced in a hydrogen stream.<br>
DE 2 056 612 A describes a process for preparing methanol, the<br>
conversion being effected over a catalyst which comprises zinc,<br>
copper and aluminum. The catalyst belongs to a mixed crystal<br>
series of the formula (CuxZny) Al2 (OH) 16.CO3.4H2O in which x and y<br>
can assume numerical values from 0.5 to 5.5, and the sum of x<br>
and y is equal to 6. The mixed crystal compound is precipitated<br><br><br>
from an aqueous solution which comprises copper, zinc and<br>
aluminum salts by adding alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal<br>
bicarbonates or mixtures thereof. The atomic ratio of the sum of<br>
the divalent metals copper and zinc to the trivalent aluminum in<br>
the mixed crystal series is constant and is 6:2. For the<br>
preparation, copper, zinc and aluminum are dissolved in water in<br>
the form of suitable salts, preferably of the nitrates, in a<br>
quantitative ratio which corresponds to the desired composition<br>
of the catalyst. This solution is heated to temperatures of from<br>
50 to 100°C, preferably from 70 to 100°C, and treated with an<br>
aqueous solution of a precipitant, for example of an alkali<br>
metal carbonate, at an appropriate temperature. The precipitate<br>
formed is filtered off, washed and dried. The dried compound is<br>
calcined at temperatures in the range from 200 to 500°C over<br>
from 12 to 24 h. The calcined product is shaped to tablets and<br>
then converted to the active form of the catalyst by reduction<br>
in a hydrogen stream.<br>
US 4,279,781 describes a catalyst for methanol synthesis, which<br>
comprises copper oxide and zinc oxide and also a metal oxide for<br>
the thermal stabilization, for example aluminum oxide. The ratio<br>
of copper oxide and zinc oxide is, calculated as the weight of<br>
the metals, from 2:1 to 3.5:1. The catalyst is prepared by<br>
coprecipitation of soluble zinc, copper and aluminum salts, for<br>
example of the nitrates. This achieves intimate mixing of the<br>
catalyst constituents. In order to obtain the active form, the<br>
catalyst precursor is reduced in a hydrogen stream.<br>
EP 0 125 689 A2 discloses a catalyst for methanol synthesis,<br>
which comprises, as catalytically active substances, copper<br>
oxide and zinc oxide and, as a thermally stabilizing substance,<br>
aluminum oxide. The catalyst features a particular pore radius<br>
distribution, the proportion of the pores having a diameter of<br>
from 20 to 75 A (mesopores) being at least 20% and the<br>
proportion of the pores having a diameter of more than 75 A<br><br><br>
(macropores) being at most 80%. The desired pore radius<br>
distribution can be achieved by using colloidally distributed<br>
aluminum oxide or hydroxide in the preparation of the catalyst.<br>
For the preparation of these catalysts, the catalytically active<br>
copper oxide-zinc oxide component is precipitated from aqueous<br>
solutions of the corresponding salts, for example the nitrates,<br>
sulfates, chlorides, acetates, with alkaline substances in the<br>
presence of a colloidally distributed aluminum oxide or<br>
hydroxide. The precipitation product can subsequently be dried,<br>
calcined, compressed to shaped bodies and optionally reduced.<br>
EP 0 152 809 A2 discloses a catalyst for synthesizing alcohol<br>
mixtures comprising methanol and higher alcohols, said catalyst<br>
comprising copper oxide and zinc oxide in the form of an oxidic<br>
precursor which can be converted by a reduction of at least a<br>
portion of the copper oxide to a catalytically active component,<br>
and also aluminum oxide as a thermally stabilizing substance,<br>
and at least one alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal oxide.<br>
The oxidic precursor has a proportion of pores having a diameter<br>
between 14 and 7.5 nm of from 20 to 70% of the total volume. The<br>
alkali metal content is from 13 to 13 0 x 10~6 gram atom of<br>
alkali metal per gram of the oxidic precursor. The aluminum<br>
oxide component was obtained from a colloidally distributed<br>
aluminum hydroxide. For the preparation of the catalyst,<br>
generally solutions of the nitrates of copper and zinc are used,<br>
and the precipitation is preferably performed with an aqueous<br>
K2CO3 solution. The concentration of the solution is preferably<br>
from 5 to 20% by weight. Instead of the nitrates, it is also<br>
possible to proceed from the corresponding metal formates or<br>
acetates. The precipitation can also be performed with the aid<br>
of a potassium hydrogen carbonate solution. The precipitation<br>
can be performed batchwise or continuously. Preference is given<br>
to performing the precipitation by continuously combining the<br>
solution of the nitrates of copper and zinc which comprises the<br>
aluminum hydroxide distributed in colloidal form with aqueous<br><br><br>
K2CO3 solution. After the precipitation, the washed precipitate<br>
of the catalyst is calcined and alkalized by treatment with a<br>
solution of an alkali metal compound. The alkalized catalyst<br>
precursors are, after drying, compressed to shaped bodies in a<br>
manner known per se, for which lubricants such as graphite can<br>
be added. In order to convert the catalyst precursor to an<br>
active form, it is reduced with hydrogen.<br>
WO 03/053569 A1 discloses a catalyst for methanol synthesis,<br>
which comprises copper oxide and zinc oxide as catalytically<br>
active substances and aluminum oxide as a thermally stabilizing<br>
substance. To prepare the catalyst, the corresponding<br>
hydroxocarbonates or hydroxides are precipitated from a solution<br>
which comprises the Cu and Zn salts and a portion of the Al<br>
salts with an alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal aluminate<br>
solution. Either the solution of the Cu and Zn salts or the<br>
alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal aluminate solution<br>
comprises an aluminum hydroxide sol. The precipitate obtained is<br>
removed from the precipitation solution, washed, dried and<br>
optionally calcined. In the preparation of the catalyst, the<br>
starting materials are preferably the copper and zinc nitrates,<br>
which are preferably precipitated with sodium carbonate or<br>
sodium aluminate.<br>
JP 2001-144779 describes a copper-zinc catalyst for the reaction<br>
of carbon monoxide and water to give carbon dioxide and water,<br>
which is prepared by mixing a solution which comprises copper<br>
formate and zinc formate with an aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
metal material. The resulting precipitate is subsequently<br>
filtered, washed, dried and calcined. The calcined solid is<br>
slurried by adding water and applied to the surface of a<br>
honeycomb carrier. The binder used may be aluminum oxide sol or<br>
zirconium oxide sol. These are added to the slurry of the<br>
calcined precipitate. The aluminum oxide is therefore not<br>
distributed homogeneously in the catalyst but rather arranged<br><br><br>
merely between the catalyst particles. It thus merely has the<br>
task of acting as a binder between the copper- and zinc-<br>
containing catalyst particles and the honeycomb carrier, and is<br>
not an active part of the catalyst.<br>
For the preparation of Cu/Zn/A1 catalysts for the methanol<br>
synthesis, copper nitrates and zinc nitrates are usually used in<br>
industrial processes owing to their good water solubility. In<br>
the precipitation, wastewaters which comprise large amounts of<br>
sodium nitrate are therefore obtained. On introduction into<br>
surface waters, this would lead to overfertilization. Before<br>
introduction into surface waters, the content of water-soluble<br>
nitrogen in the wastewater obtained in the preparation of the<br>
methanol synthesis catalyst must therefore be reduced<br>
drastically.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a process<br>
for preparing Cu/Zn/Al catalysts which firstly enables a<br>
significant reduction in the salt burden, especially of alkali<br>
metal nitrates, in the wastewater, and which secondly provides<br>
catalysts for the methanol synthesis which have at least a<br>
comparable activity to a catalyst prepared from metal nitrates.<br>
This object is achieved by a process having the features of<br>
claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the process form the<br>
subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
In the process according to the invention for preparing Cu/Zn/Al<br>
catalysts, a first aqueous solution which comprises at least<br>
copper formate and zinc formate is first prepared. In addition,<br>
a second solution which comprises a precipitant is prepared. A<br>
precipitant is understood to be a reagent which directly or<br>
indirectly provides ions, for example hydroxyl ions and/or<br>
carbonate ions, with which the metals, especially copper, zinc<br>
and aluminum, can be precipitated. The first solution and/or the<br>
second solution comprises an aluminum hydroxide sol/gel mixture.<br><br><br>
An aluminum hydroxide sol is understood to mean a finely<br>
dispersed distribution of aluminum hydroxide in water, in which<br>
polyacids have already formed by condensation of aluminum<br>
hydroxide, but still no particles are perceptible with the naked<br>
eye in the aqueous phase, i.e. a clear solution is present. An<br>
aluminum hydroxide gel is understood to mean a dispersion of<br>
aluminum hydroxide in water where relatively large agglomerates<br>
of polyacids have already formed, such that particles can be<br>
perceived even with the naked eye, for example as opacity of the<br>
aqueous phase.<br>
In a precipitation step, the first solution and the second<br>
solution are combined to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate<br>
is removed from the aqueous phase, and the aqueous phase forms<br>
wastewater which is sent to a workup.<br>
The precipitate is washed until it has an alkali metal content<br>
of less than 500 ppm based on the catalyst calcined at 600°C.<br>
Subsequently, the precipitate is dried, optionally calcined and<br>
ground.<br>
In the process according to the invention, no nitrate-containing<br>
wastewaters are obtained. As a result of the use of copper<br>
formate and zinc formate as water-soluble copper and zinc salts,<br>
the wastewater comprises formate ions which can be worked up in<br>
a simple manner. Through the use of formates, the contamination<br>
of the wastewater with organic material is kept relatively low.<br>
This is an advantage over the use of higher carboxylic acids,<br>
such as acetic acid, since they increase the organic<br>
contamination in the wastewater through the greater number of<br>
C-H bonds. As a further advantage, formic acid, which is<br>
required for the preparation of the copper formates and zinc<br>
formates, can be prepared inexpensively, so that the process<br>
according to the invention is also advantageous from cost<br>
aspects.<br><br><br>
For the process according to the invention, it is essential that<br>
at least a portion of the aluminum is introduced into the<br>
precipitation solution in the form of an aluminum hydroxide sol<br>
and another portion as an aluminum hydroxide gel. When the<br>
addition of the aluminum hydroxide sol/gel mixture into the<br>
solution of the metal salts is dispensed with, the weight-time<br>
yield falls (WTY, [kg of methanol/{kg of catalyst x hour}]).<br>
After the removal, the precipitate is washed carefully, such<br>
that its alkali metal content, based on the oxidic catalyst<br>
calcined at 600°C, falls to values of less than 500 ppm,<br>
preferably less than 400 ppm, especially to values in the range<br>
from 100 to 300 ppm. The washing water obtained can be combined<br>
with the formate-containing wastewater and optionally worked up.<br>
After the washing, drying and optionally calcining, the oxidic<br>
form of the catalyst still has a residual formate content of<br>
less than 5% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 4% by weight,<br>
especially preferably 1 - 2% by weight. The formate content can<br>
be determined, for example, by oxidative titration or by<br>
quantitative chromatographic processes, for example HPLC.<br>
As well as the copper formate and the zinc formate, the first<br>
aqueous solution may also comprise customary promoters, for<br>
example calcium, magnesium, manganese, cerium, lanthanum, and<br>
also ruthenium or palladium. As well as the promoters mentioned,<br>
it is also possible for other promoters to be used. The<br>
promoters are preferably likewise introduced in the form of<br>
their formates, preferably into the first aqueous solution.<br>
Their proportion in the oxidic form of the catalyst is,<br>
calculated as the oxide, preferably less than 10% by weight,<br>
especially less than 5% by weight. When noble metals, such as<br>
ruthenium or palladium, are used as promoters, they are present<br>
preferably in amounts of less than 1% by weight.<br><br><br>
As already mentioned, in the process according to the invention,<br>
the first and/or the second solution comprises an aluminum<br>
hydroxide sol/gel mixture. The starting material used for the<br>
aluminum hydroxide sol /gel may, for example, be a commercially<br>
available product. The aluminum hydroxide sol/gel mixture can,<br>
though, also be obtained by adding a little ammonium hydroxide<br>
to a dilute aluminum salt solution while avoiding heating in<br>
order to delay the conversion to coarsely dispersed hydroxo<br>
derivatives. In a further variant, a small amount of acid can be<br>
added to an alkali metal aluminate solution to form the aluminum<br>
hydroxide sol/gel. The aluminum hydroxide sol/gel is preferably<br>
present in the first aqueous solution. The conversion products<br>
formed from the aluminum hydroxide sol/gel serve both as<br>
supports and as thermally stabilizing substances. Without being<br>
bound to this theory, the inventors suspect that the aluminum<br>
hydroxide sol/gel mixture, in the course of heating, forms a<br>
three-dimensional network in whose gaps the copper crystals<br>
which belong to the active species and are present after the<br>
reduction are arranged. As a result, further growth of the<br>
copper crystals during the methanol synthesis becomes more<br>
difficult, which increases the stability of the catalyst and its<br>
lifetime in industrial processes.<br>
Zinc oxide is assumed firstly to exert an important influence on<br>
the formation of the active species and secondly to contribute<br>
to the stability of the catalyst through its partially<br>
needlelike structure. Moreover, the zinc oxide acts as a<br>
scavenger of poisons by reacting with any sulfur compounds which<br>
occur.<br>
The oxides of calcium, of magnesium, of manganese, of cerium and<br>
of lanthanum which may be present as promoters likewise have a<br>
stabilizing action.<br><br><br>
The first solution, which comprises a mixture of different metal<br>
salts, is preferably prepared by<br>
preparing an aqueous copper formate solution by<br>
dissolving a copper salt without residue by adding<br>
formic acid,<br>
preparing an aqueous dispersion or solution of a<br>
zinc salt,<br>
preparing an aqueous aluminum salt solution, and<br>
combining the copper formate solution, the<br>
dispersion or solution of the zinc salt and the<br>
aluminum salt solution.<br>
When the Cu/Zn/A1 catalyst is still to be modified by promoters,<br>
they may, for example, be added to the first solution. The<br>
promoters may be added in the form of suitable salts, for<br>
example as carbonates, oxides or hydroxides. In principle, these<br>
salts may be added at any time, i.e. to the copper formate<br>
solution, to the dispersion or solution of the zinc salt, or<br>
else after combination of the copper formate solution and of the<br>
dispersion or solution of the zinc salt. Particularly expensive<br>
promoters, such as noble metals, are preferably added to the<br>
suspension in a later process step, for example before the spray<br>
drying, or sprayed onto the dry powder in ultrafinely<br>
distributed form after the spray-drying.<br>
In the preparation of the copper-zinc formate solution,<br>
preference is given to adding sufficient formic acid that, based<br>
on the amount of copper salt and zinc salt used, taking account<br>
of the stoichiometry, the formic acid is present in an excess of<br>
at least 10 mol%, preferably from 10 to 20 mol%, especially<br>
preferably from 14 to 16 mol%. After the addition of the formic<br>
acid, the pH of the copper formate solution is preferably less<br>
than 3, preferably less than 2.5.<br><br><br>
In a preferred process version, the solution or dispersion of<br>
the zinc salt is combined with the copper formate solution.<br>
After the copper formate solution or dispersion and the zinc<br>
salt solution or dispersion have been combined, both the copper<br>
and the zinc are present in the form of their formates in<br>
solution. The resulting solution preferably has a pH in the<br>
range from 3.0 to 4.0, especially preferably from 3.5 to 3.7.<br>
Subsequently, the aluminum salt solution is added to the<br>
copper/zinc solution.<br>
The aluminum salt solution is preferably added to the<br>
copper/zinc solution in several portions. In this case, at least<br>
one first portion of the aluminum salt solution is prepared by<br>
dissolving at least a first portion of the aluminum salt in<br>
water with addition of formic acid.<br>
In the preparation of the first portion of the aluminum salt<br>
solution, the procedure is preferably first to dissolve sodium<br>
aluminate, for example, in water and then to add sufficient<br>
formic acid that the pH is in the range of less than 5,<br>
preferably from 4.5 to 2, especially from 4 to 3. Preferably<br>
sufficient formic acid is added to obtain a clear solution.<br>
Preference is given to preparing a second portion of the<br>
aluminum salt solution by dissolving a second portion of the<br>
aluminum salt in water. In this case, no formic acid is added to<br>
the second portion of the aluminum salt solution. To complete<br>
the first solution, which comprises the mixture of all metal<br>
salts before the precipitation, the first portion of the<br>
aluminum salt solution and the second portion of the aluminum<br>
salt solution, preferably offset in time, are preferably added<br>
to the aqueous copper/zinc solution.<br>
The second portion of the aluminum salt solution is prepared,<br>
for example, by dissolving NaAlO2 in water. The pH of the<br>
aqueous NaAlO2 solution is, depending on the alkali excess in<br><br><br>
the reactant, in the range from 11 to 14, preferably from 12 to<br>
13.<br>
The proportions of the first and second portion of the aluminum<br>
salt solution may, based on the aluminum content, be selected<br>
within the range from 0:100 to 100:0, preferably from 1:99 to<br>
99:1, more preferably from 30:70 to 70:30 and especially<br>
preferably at about 50:50.<br>
The aluminum salt solutions are prepared preferably at<br>
temperatures of less than 40°C, especially preferably less than<br>
30°C. This temperature should also not be exceeded when the<br>
aluminum salt solution is added to the copper/zinc solution or<br>
to the copper formate solution or to the dispersion or solution<br>
of the zinc salt. In this way, the formation of coarsely<br>
dispersed polymeric aluminum compounds is suppressed. Coarsely<br>
dispersed polymeric aluminum compounds are understood to mean<br>
complex aluminum hydroxo compounds which form particles which<br>
are visible to the eye and sink relatively rapidly. Preference<br>
is therefore given to preparing the solutions in a tank which is<br>
equipped with an appropriate cooling device.<br>
Aluminum salts which can be used in a suitable manner in the<br>
process according to the invention are, for example, aluminum<br>
di- and triformate, Al(NO3)3 hydrates or NaAlO2. The aluminum<br>
salt solutions preferably have an aluminum concentration in the<br>
range from about 0.4 to about 1.1 mol/1, especially preferably<br>
from about 0.9 to 1.1 mol/1. The upper value of the range<br>
specified is determined by the solubility limit of the aluminum<br>
salt, while the lower limit arises from economic considerations.<br>
The copper salts used are preferably those salts whose anions<br>
are oxides, hydroxides and carbonates or their derivatives<br>
obtained by reduction, and can no longer be detected separately<br>
by means of distinguishable elements in the first solution or in<br><br><br>
the oxidic form of the catalyst. The copper salt is preferably<br>
selected from CuO, Cu(OH)2 and Cu (OH)2.CuCO3 .<br>
The zinc salt selected is preferably likewise a zinc compound<br>
whose anion is not disruptive in the first solution or in the<br>
oxidic precursor of the catalyst, and is preferably not<br>
detectable as a distinguishable element. The zinc salt selected<br>
is preferably ZnO.<br>
The concentration of the copper formate solution is preferably<br>
selected such that, after the copper formate solution and zinc<br>
salt solution or dispersion have been combined, the<br>
concentration of the copper is set within a range of from about<br>
0.1 to about 0.5 mol/1, especially preferably from 0.3 to about<br>
0.5 mol/1. The upper limit is determined by the solubility limit<br>
of the copper salt, while the lower limit arises from economic<br>
considerations, since the processing of dilute solutions gives<br>
rise to relatively large volumes, which influences, for example,<br>
the dimensioning of the apparatus in which the process according<br>
to the invention is performed.<br>
The concentration of the zinc salt is preferably selected such<br>
that, after the copper formate solution and zinc salt solution<br>
or dispersion have been combined, the concentration of the zinc<br>
is preferably within the range from about 0.1 to about<br>
0.2 mol/1, preferably from 0.15 to about 0.2 mol/1. The upper<br>
limit arises here too from the solubility of the zinc salt, and<br>
the lower limit from economic considerations.<br>
The aluminum salt solution is preferably added to the<br>
copper/zinc solution. The pH of the first solution, which<br>
preferably comprises the total amount of Cu, Zn and Al, is then<br>
preferably adjusted to a value in the range from 4.0 to 5.0,<br>
more preferably from 4.2 to 4.4.<br><br>
The precipitation reagent used is preferably an alkali metal<br>
base. The alkali metal bases used are preferably alkali metal<br>
carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates or alkali metal<br>
aluminates. The alkali metal used is preferably sodium. When,<br>
for example, a sodium carbonate solution is used as the<br>
precipitation reagent, the sodium carbonate solution preferably<br>
has a concentration of from 80 g/1 to 200 g/1, preferably from<br>
170 to 180 g/1.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, the precipitation reagent used is hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide is added to the first solution or<br>
dispersion, which comprises copper, zinc and aluminum in the<br>
form of their formates or hydroxoformates. The hydrogen peroxide<br>
oxidizes the formate to carbonate, so that the metals are<br>
precipitated in the form of their hydroxocarbonates, carbonates<br>
or hydroxides. In the oxidation of the formate anion, first the<br>
hydrogencarbonate anion and then the carbonate anion are formed<br>
with rising pH. The metal ions used are precipitated as<br>
hydroxocarbonates in a sequential precipitation in the series of<br>
Al-Cu-Zn. The use of a carbonate-containing alkali metal<br>
solution can thus be dispensed with. In addition to hydrogen<br>
peroxide, it is also possible to use other suitable oxidizing<br>
agents, for example ozone.<br>
To prepare the oxidic catalyst precursor, first and second<br>
solution are first combined to obtain a precipitate. The<br>
precipitation is preferably performed in such a way that, during<br>
the precipitation, a pH in the range from 3.5 to 7.5, preferably<br>
from 6.0 to 7.0, especially preferably 6.5 ± 0.1, is maintained.<br>
The temperature during the precipitation is preferably kept<br>
within a range from 2 5 to 95°C, especially preferably from 50 to<br>
75°C.<br><br><br>
After the mixing, the precipitate formed is preferably aged. To<br>
this end, the suspension obtained in the mixing of first and<br>
second solution can, for example, be transferred to an aging<br>
vessel in which the suspension can be moved, for example, with a<br>
suitable stirrer.<br>
The aging is performed preferably over a period of from<br>
10 minutes to 10 hours, especially preferably from 1 to 5 hours.<br>
During the aging, the suspension is preferably heated, the aging<br>
being effected especially at a temperature of more than 60°C,<br>
especially preferably within the range from 65 to 80°C.<br>
The combination of first and second solution is preferably<br>
performed in such a way that the solutions are introduced in<br>
parallel into a mixing vessel and mixed there. Rapid mixing is<br>
effected therein, for example by means of a suitable stirrer.<br>
However, preference is given to performing the precipitation as<br>
a continuous precipitation. To this end, an appropriately<br>
dimensioned mixing vessel is provided, into which first and<br>
second solution are fed continuously and the resulting mixture<br>
is removed continuously. The volume of the mixing vessel is<br>
preferably selected such that first and second solution can be<br>
fed continuously into the mixing vessel and the mixture can be<br>
removed continuously, the residence time of the mixture being<br>
preferably within the range from about 0.1 second to 10 minutes,<br>
more preferably from about 1 to 120 seconds, especially<br>
preferably from 1 to 20 seconds.<br>
The residence time of the mixture in the mixing vessel depends<br>
greatly upon the dimensioning of the mixing vessel and the flow<br>
rate. The dimensioning of the mixing vessel and the feed and<br>
removal rates of the solutions or suspension can be selected in<br>
a suitable manner correspondingly by the person skilled in the<br>
art.<br><br><br>
After the precipitation and any aging step performed, the<br>
precipitate is removed from the aqueous phase, for which<br>
customary processes can be used, for example a filtration. The<br>
precipitate is subsequently washed and dried. The precipitate is<br>
preferably calcined after drying. Depending on the process used,<br>
the calcination is effected at temperatures of preferably from<br>
140°C to 1000°C, especially preferably from 170°C to 350°C, for<br>
a period of at least 0.1 second, preferably at least 4 minutes,<br>
more preferably from 20 minutes to 8 hours, especially<br>
preferably from 30 minutes to 4 hours. Depending on the<br>
calcination conditions selected, the formate remaining in the<br>
filtercake, in the course of calcining, is largely eliminated<br>
oxidatively under air or by an intramolecular redox reaction<br>
under inert gas. In the latter case, the Cu (HCO2)2.H2O is<br>
suspected to be decomposed first to H2 and CuC2O2. The copper<br>
oxalate then reacts further to give CO2 and elemental copper.<br>
The calcination can be performed in customary apparatus. In an<br>
industrial manufacture, owing to the better heat transfer, both<br>
pulsation reactors and fluidized bed reactors, such as the<br>
commercially preferred rotary tube ovens, are used. Pulsation<br>
dryers enable very short drying times in the region of less than<br>
1 second, generally within the range from 0.1 second to<br>
4 minutes, and very high temperatures of up to 1000°C may be<br>
employed.<br>
The calcined powder can optionally be ground and then processed<br>
by means of customary tools, for example to tablets or<br>
extrudates. However, it is also possible to slurry the powder,<br>
to grind it to a very fine particle size and to coat suitable<br>
support bodies, for example honeycombs, with the resulting<br>
suspension. It is possible here to employ customary processes.<br>
The particle size is suitably adjusted such that the mean<br>
particle size D50 is in the range from 10 nm to 10 µm,<br>
especially preferably from 100 nm to 5 µm. The mean particle<br><br><br>
size can be determined, for example, by laser light scattering.<br>
Suitable catalysts can be prepared, for example, with particle<br>
sizes in which the D50 value is in the range of about 2-3 µm.<br>
A particular advantage of the process according to the invention<br>
is that the formate-containing wastewater obtained after the<br>
removal of the precipitate can be worked up by comparatively<br>
simple means. For this purpose, the formate-containing<br>
wastewater is preferably subjected to an oxidative treatment,<br>
which oxidizes the formate ions in the aqueous solution,<br>
depending on the pH, essentially to carbonate,<br>
hydrogencarbonate, carbon dioxide and water. The content in the<br>
wastewater of formate, for example in the form of sodium<br>
formate, in an industrial implementation of the process<br>
according to the invention, is typically in the range from 0.2<br>
to 1.5 mol/1, especially preferably from 0.8 to 1.0 mol/1,<br>
although it is also possible for higher or lower formate<br>
concentrations to be present. The oxidative treatment of the<br>
wastewater allows the formate concentration to be lowered to<br>
values of less than 0.1 mol/1, preferably from 0.01 to<br>
0.075 mol/1, especially preferably from 0.02 to 0.04 mol/1. This<br>
corresponds to a lowering in the amount of formate present in<br>
the wastewater by more than 95%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, hydrogen peroxide is added to the<br>
formate-containing wastewater for oxidative treatment. The<br>
hydrogen peroxide is preferably added to the formate-containing<br>
wastewater in the form of a solution whose hydrogen peroxide<br>
concentration is in the range from about 9 to 20 mol/1 (up to<br>
approx. 60% by weight). In the case that the relevant transport<br>
regulations are complied with, the concentration of the hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution used can be increased up to above 90% by<br>
weight. Preference is given to adding the hydrogen peroxide in<br>
excess, in which case the amount added, based on the formate<br>
present in the wastewater, is selected within the range from 160<br><br><br>
to 200 mol%, especially preferably from 160 to 170 mol%. As well<br>
as hydrogen peroxide, it is also possible to use other oxidizing<br>
agents, for example ozone or sodium hypochlorite solution. In<br>
the selection of the oxidizing agents, for example, production<br>
costs and environmental legislation play a role. Depending on<br>
the legal limits and the further purification stages available,<br>
it is under some circumstances not necessary to oxidize the<br>
entire amount of the formate ions. It may actually be sufficient<br>
to considerably reduce the concentration of the formate ions by<br>
a chemical oxidative treatment and to feed the wastewater thus<br>
treated optionally, for example, to a biological clarification<br>
stage.<br>
The treatment of the formate-containing wastewater with hydrogen<br>
peroxide is performed preferably at from 20 to 95°C, especially<br>
preferably at from 50 to 80°C, within a pH range of 4 - 8,<br>
especially preferably from 5.0 to 6.5.<br>
In one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the<br>
oxidative treatment of the formate-containing wastewater is<br>
effected actually before the removal of the precipitate. To this<br>
end, after the aging step, for example, a suitable amount of<br>
hydrogen peroxide can be added to the suspension and the<br>
precipitate can be removed only after the substantial oxidative<br>
degradation of the formate ions. Alternatively, in the course of<br>
the process with time, the hydrogen peroxide solution can also<br>
be added actually to the Cu-, Zn-, Al-containing formate<br>
solution, in which case the precipitation reagent, carbonate<br>
ions, is generated from formate ions by oxidation.<br>
The oxidative workup of the wastewater by adding a suitable<br>
oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, is quite simple to<br>
perform in apparatus terms and also enables the treatment of<br>
wastewaters which have a relatively high concentration of<br>
formate ions. However, it is also possible that the oxidative<br><br><br>
treatment is effected solely by a biological treatment of the<br>
formate-containing wastewater. If appropriate, the formate-<br>
containing wastewater can be diluted to a suitable concentration<br>
for this purpose.<br>
The oxidative treatment of the formate-containing wastewater is<br>
preferably performed in such a way that the formate<br>
concentration in the wastewater after the oxidative treatment is<br>
less than 0.1% by weight.<br>
When the Cu/Zn/A1 catalyst obtained using the formates is<br>
compared with catalysts which have been prepared starting from<br>
the nitrates, the catalyst obtained by the process according to<br>
the invention exhibits a better to comparable activity and a<br>
comparable selectivity. The long-term stability of the catalyst<br>
prepared using the formates, which has been determined in the<br>
methanol synthesis test at 250°C, is also somewhat better than<br>
or at least comparable with the stability of a catalyst which<br>
has been prepared starting from the metal nitrates. The<br>
invention therefore also provides a catalyst which can be<br>
prepared by the above-described process.<br>
The inventive catalyst contains, in its oxidic form, less than<br>
5% by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 4% by weight,<br>
especially preferably between 1 and 2% by weight of formate,<br>
calculated as formic acid. Gentle calcination allows<br>
preservation of the formate structure which, according to the<br>
lock-and-key principle which is frequently encountered in<br>
catalysis, can play an important role for the attainment of a<br>
high activity. A gentle calcination at about 170°C for 4 minutes<br>
forms a catalyst which exhibits a very high activity at 250°C.<br>
The inventive catalyst features a high mesopore volume. The<br>
proportion of mesopores having a radius of from 3.75 to 7.0 nm<br>
in the total pore volume is preferably more than 30%, preferably<br>
from 30 to 80%. The total pore volume includes the volume of the<br><br><br>
pores having a radius of from 3.75 to 7500 nm. The pore volume<br>
can be determined by the mercury intrusion method. The total<br>
pore volume, determined on 6 x 4 mm tablets, is preferably<br>
100 mm3/g - 700 mm3/g, preferably 250 mm3/g - 450 mm3/g.<br>
The proportion of the copper, calculated as CuO and based on the<br>
weight of the oxidic catalyst form, taking account of the<br>
ignition loss at 600°C, is selected preferably between 55 and 69<br>
by weight, especially preferably 60 and 63 by weight.<br>
The proportion of the zinc, calculated as ZnO and based on the<br>
weight of the oxidic catalyst form, taking account of the<br>
ignition loss at 600°C, is selected preferably between 20 and<br>
33% by weight, especially preferably between 25 and 31% by<br>
weight.<br>
The proportion of aluminum, calculated as Al2O3 and based on the<br>
weight of the oxidic catalyst form, is selected preferably<br>
between 5 and 20% by weight, especially preferably between 8 and<br>
11% by weight.<br>
The percentages for the proportions of the copper, zinc and<br>
aluminum are based on a catalyst calcined at 600°C for three<br>
hours.<br>
The inventive catalyst also has, in the oxidic form, an alkali<br>
metal ion content, especially sodium ion content, of preferably<br>
less than 500 ppm, especially preferably less than 300 ppm,<br>
especially from 100 ppm to 300 ppm.<br>
In its oxidic form, the inventive catalyst preferably has a<br>
specific surface area of more than 90 m2/g, especially<br>
preferably more than 100 m2/g.<br>
The inventive catalyst can in principle be molded as shaped<br>
bodies with any shape. For example, it can be configured in the<br>
form of rings, 3-20 hole shaped bodies, tablets with a smooth or<br><br><br>
undulating surface, or honeycombs. The dimensioning of the<br>
shaped bodies corresponds to the customary values. For the<br>
preparation of the shaped bodies, the pulverulent catalyst,<br>
optionally with addition of a lubricant, such as graphite, is<br>
compressed, for example to tablets of, for example, 6x4 mm.<br>
Before use, the catalyst is converted from the oxidic form to<br>
the active form. To this end, the copper oxide is at least<br>
partly reduced to elemental copper. For this purpose, the oxidic<br>
form of the inventive catalyst is preferably reduced in a<br>
hydrogen stream. The activation can be effected directly within<br>
the synthesis reactor and is preferably done by reducing first<br>
with the aid of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, comprising a<br>
small amount of hydrogen. The nitrogen typically contains<br>
initially about 2.0% by volume of H2. In this case, the<br>
temperature is raised, for example, from 100 to 235°C over a<br>
period of 16 hours. Thereafter, the hydrogen content is<br>
increased, and reduction is effected, for example, with 20% by<br>
volume of H2 (remainder N2) within the temperature range from<br>
235 to 270°C over a period of 3 hours. The reductive treatment<br>
can be completed with 99.9% H2 at from 270°C to 300°C over a<br>
period of about 3 hours. Typically, activation is effected with<br>
a superficial velocity of from about 3000 to 4000 liters of<br>
reduction gas per hour and liter of catalyst.<br>
In the reduced state, the size of the copper crystals is<br>
preferably from about 4 to 12 nm, preferably from 5 to 7 nm.<br>
The inventive catalyst is suitable especially for use in<br>
methanol synthesis. The invention therefore also provides for<br>
the use of the above-described catalyst for synthesizing<br>
methanol from CO, CO2 and H2. The synthesis is typically<br>
performed at a temperature of from about 200 to 320°C,<br>
preferably at from 210°C to 280°C, at a pressure of from about<br>
40 to 150 bar, preferably at from about 60 to 100 bar, and at a<br><br><br>
superficial velocity of from about 2000 to 22 000, preferably<br>
from 8000 to 12 000, liters of synthesis gas per hour and liter<br>
of catalyst, and the synthesis gas may contain from about 5 to<br>
25% by volume, preferably from 6 to 12% by volume, of CO, from<br>
about 4 to 10% by volume of CO2, from about 10 to 30% by volume<br>
of N2 plus CH4 (inert gases) and, as the remainder, H2.<br>
The inventive catalyst is also suitable for use in methanol<br>
reformation and in the low-temperature conversion of carbon<br>
monoxide to carbon dioxide. The latter reaction, also referred<br>
to as the low-temperature shift (LTS), is effected at<br>
temperatures in the range from about 175 to 250°C, preferably<br>
from 205 to 215°C, and steam/gas ratios in the range from about<br>
0.4 to 1.5 (1 (STP)/1 (STP)). Typical feed gas mixtures contain<br>
about 3% by volume of CO, 17% by volume of CO2, 2% by volume of<br>
N2 and 7 8% by volume of H2, which are passed through the reactor<br>
with superficial velocities of from about 2000 to 12 000 1 of<br>
dry gas (i.e. without water) per liter of catalyst and hour.<br>
Good catalysts achieve, at a superficial velocity of 11 200 h-1<br>
and a ratio of steam to gas of about 1.5, CO conversions of from<br>
70 to 85%.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail hereinafter with<br>
reference to examples.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
(a) Preparation of the copper solution<br>
5054 g of a suspension of Cu(OH)2.CuCO3 (Cu content: 27.7% by<br>
weight, corresponding to 1400 g of Cu) are dispersed in a 10 1<br>
beaker and admixed in portions with a total of 2399 ml of 85%<br>
formic acid (D = 1.1856 g/cm3) until the CO2 evolution has<br>
ended. The copper solution has a pH of 2.35 and a temperature of<br>
55°C.<br><br><br>
(b)	Preparation of the Cu/Zn solution (precursor to first<br>
solution)<br>
In a 5 1 beaker, a ZnO dispersion is prepared from 7 81 g of ZnO<br>
and 4000 ml of H2O. The suspension is combined with the copper<br>
solution obtained in (a) . With continued dispersion, a further<br>
890 ml of formic acid and 33.6 1 of demineralized water are<br>
added in portions. The blue, initially still slightly opal<br>
solution is stirred until it is completely clear.<br>
(c)	Preparation of the sodium carbonate solution (second<br>
solution)<br>
24 000 ml of Na2CO3 solution which has a concentration of<br>
approx. 180 g of CO3/100 ml are prepared, and the solution is<br>
heated to 7 0°C.<br>
(d)	Preparation of the aluminum solution I<br>
A 5 1 stirred apparatus provided with a cooling device is<br>
initially charged with 2193 ml of demineralized water and<br>
246.7 g of NaAlO2 are added. The solution is heated to a<br>
temperature of not more than 30°C, and then 350 ml of formic<br>
acid are added in portions. The milky solution has a pH of<br>
approx.4.0.<br>
(e)	Preparation of the aluminum solution II<br>
A stirred apparatus provided with a cooling device is initially<br>
charged with 2193 ml of water, and 246.7 g of NaAlO2 are added<br>
in portions. It is ensured that the temperature of the solution<br>
does not exceed 30°C. The mixture is stirred until a clear<br>
solution is obtained.<br>
(f)	Precipitation<br>
The solution obtained in (b) is transferred to a first reservoir<br>
tank of a mixing apparatus. Subsequently, the aluminum solution<br><br><br>
I obtained in (d) is introduced into the tank and stirred there<br>
at room temperature until the combined solutions are completely<br>
clear. Water can optionally be added in order to eliminate the<br>
opalescence of the solution. Before the start of precipitation,<br>
the solution is heated to 70°C. Approx. 30 minutes before the<br>
start of precipitation, the aluminum solution II obtained in (e)<br>
is transferred into the tank, which forms a milky, white-bluish<br>
suspension.<br>
The Na2CO3 solution obtained in (c) is introduced into a second<br>
reservoir tank and heated to 70°C.<br>
The solutions present in the first and second tank are<br>
simultaneously fed to a mixing apparatus and, after a residence<br>
time of about 20 s, pass from there into an overflow vessel. The<br>
pumping rates are adjusted such that the pH during the<br>
precipitation is about 6.5 ± 0.1. From the mixing apparatus, the<br>
mixture passes into an overflow vessel. From the overflow<br>
vessel, the suspension formed passes into an aging vessel, where<br>
it is kept at approx. 65°C with stirring. The precipitation has<br>
ended after approx. 35 minutes. Subsequently, the unit is<br>
flushed with approx. 600 ml of demineralized water and the<br>
temperature in the aging vessel is increased to 70°C. After the<br>
flushing operation has ended, the suspension is aged with<br>
stirring. The commencement of the aging is defined by the end of<br>
the flushing operation. The aging times employed in the examples<br>
are specified in table 2.<br>
After the aging has ended, the suspension is filtered and washed<br>
with demineralized water until the residual content of sodium in<br>
the filtercake has fallen to less than 350 ppm, and the<br>
resulting solid is dried by spray-drying using a one-substance<br>
nozzle in countercurrent. The feed established is a suspension<br>
with a dry substance content of 30% by weight. The heating gas<br>
entrance temperature is 330 - 350°C, the product exit<br><br><br>
temperature 110 - 120°C. The dried powder is subsequently<br>
calcined at about 320°C for 50 minutes either in porcelain<br>
dishes in a staged oven or in a batchwise laboratory rotary tube<br>
oven.<br>
(g) Treatment of the wastewater<br>
The wastewater obtained in the filtration and the washing is<br>
treated by adding hydrogen peroxide, the pH being kept between 5<br>
and 6.5 with sulfuric acid and the temperature of the wastewater<br>
at approx. 7 0°C. The formate concentration of the wastewater is<br>
adjusted to values between 2.8% by weight and 0.09% by weight.<br>
The selectivity, defined as mol of formate converted/mol of<br>
hydrogen peroxide used, is approx. 60%.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE<br>
(a)	Preparation of a copper/zinc nitrate solution<br>
781.25 g of zinc oxide are added to 9.79 kg of a copper nitrate<br>
solution which contains 1400 g of copper. 2 077 g of nitric acid<br>
(58%) are then added and the mixture is stirred until the solids<br>
have dissolved completely.<br>
(b)	Preparation of an aluminum nitrate solution<br>
246.7 g of Na2AlO2 are dissolved in 1.5 1 of demineralized<br>
water. 1365 g of nitric acid (58%) are then added and the<br>
mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained. The<br>
aluminum nitrate solution obtained is added to the copper/zinc<br>
nitrate solution and the Cu/Zn/Al solution is heated to 60°C.<br>
(c)	Preparation of the aluminum sol<br>
246.7 g of Na2AlO2 are dissolved in 1.5 1 of demineralized water<br>
with stirring over 30 minutes. The resulting solution is added<br>
to the Cu/Zn/Al solution and the mixture is heated to 60°C.<br><br>
(d) Precipitation<br>
The mixture obtained in (c) is introduced into the first<br>
reservoir tank of a mixing apparatus. 25 1 of an aqueous<br>
solution which contains 172 g of Na2CO3 per liter are introduced<br>
into the second reservoir tank of the mixing apparatus. The two<br>
solutions are pumped simultaneously into a mixing vessel and the<br>
mixture is passed from there into an aging vessel.<br>
After the end of precipitation, the mixing vessel is flushed<br>
with demineralized water, the temperature in the aging vessel is<br>
increased to 7 0°C and the precipitate is aged for 1 or 4 hours.<br>
After the aging has ended, the suspension is filtered and washed<br>
with demineralized water until the residual content of sodium in<br>
the filtercake has fallen to less than 350 ppm, and the<br>
resulting solid is dried in countercurrent by spray-drying using<br>
a one-substance nozzle. The heating gas entrance temperature is<br>
330 - 350°C, the product exit temperature 110 -120°C. The dried<br>
powder is subsequently calcined at about 320°C for 50 minutes<br>
either in porcelain dishes in a staged oven or in a batchwise<br>
laboratory rotary tube oven.<br>
The precipitation examples performed and the calcination<br>
conditions employed thereafter are compiled in tables 2a + b.<br>
Likewise included in these tables are the chemical compositions<br>
and the physical parameters of the resulting oxidic catalyst<br>
precursors.<br>
The determination of the physical parameters is undertaken in<br>
the following manner:<br>
Determination of the Cu crystal size:<br>
The size of the Cu crystals is determined by means of X-ray<br>
powder diffractometry (XRD). The Cu (111) reflection in the<br>
region of ~ 43.3°(2D) is analyzed. The half-height width and the<br>
integral intensity of the reflection are calculated with the<br><br>
pseudo-Voigt function. The Cu crystal size is calculated with<br>
the aid of the Scherrer function on the basis of the calculated<br>
half-height width.<br>
For preparation for the X-ray determination of the crystal size,<br>
the oxidic catalysts are reduced as follows:<br>
2 - 5 g of tablets having a size of 6 x 4 mm are heated in a<br>
tube reactor from room temperature to a maximum temperature at a<br>
heating rate of 2°C/min with a reduction gas (98% N2, 2% H2) .<br>
Catalysts which have been prepared from the formates are heated<br>
to a maximum temperature of 80 - 120°C. Catalysts which have<br>
been prepared using the nitrates are first heated to 175°C<br>
overnight. Subsequently, within less than 2 hours, the maximum<br>
temperature is established: 180°C for catalysts from a) the<br>
formate/carbonate route; 240°C for catalysts from b) the<br>
nitrate/carbonate route. While maintaining the maximum<br>
temperature, the hydrogen content of the reduction gas is<br>
finally increased to 100% within one hour and then the sample is<br>
reduced for a further 3 hours.<br>
Determination of the specific surface area<br>
The BET surface area is determined by the one-point nitrogen<br>
method on the pulverulent oxidic catalyst and on 6 x 4 mm<br>
tablets on the basis of DIN 66132.<br>
Determination of the ignition loss<br>
When the ignition loss is to be determined on tablets, they are<br>
first ground to a powder. The sample to be determined is weighed<br>
into a weighed porcelain crucible which had been heated<br>
beforehand at 600°C in a muffle furnace for 3 hours and then<br>
cooled to room temperature in a desiccator. The crucible is<br>
heated to 600°C in a muffle furnace for 3 hours and then cooled<br>
to room temperature in a desiccator. The cooled crucible is<br><br><br>
weighed again and the ignition loss at 600°C is determined from<br>
the difference.<br>
Determination of the side crushing strength<br>
The side crushing strength is determined to DIN EN 1094-5, 1995-<br>
09 edition, feuerfeste Erzeugnisse fur Isolationszwecke<br>
[Refractory products for insulation purposes] - part 5:<br>
Bestimmung der Kaltdruckfestigkeit geformter Erzeugnisse<br>
[Determination of the cold compressive strength of molded<br>
products] . The determination is performed with a commercial<br>
instrument such as Schleuninger 6-D or ERWEKA TBH 310 MD<br>
according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions.<br>
For a representative sample amount of 100 tablets, the pressures<br>
acting on their cylinder layer in the bursting operation are<br>
determined and evaluated with the instrument's own statistics<br>
program for mean, standard deviation and minimum and maximum<br>
hardness. The distribution of the tablet hardness (N) is shown<br>
in graphic form.<br>
Determination of the pore volume<br>
The pore volume is determined by the mercury intrusion method on<br>
the basis of DIN 66133 on the pulverulent oxidic catalysts and<br>
on 6 x 4 mm tablets.<br>
Determination of the formate content<br>
Approx. 10 to 20 g of the calcined catalyst powder are taken up<br>
in 25 + x ml of H2SO4 (25%) and dissolved with heating to<br>
approx. 70°C in a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The amount x ml of<br>
H2SO4 (25%) is determined by the minimum amount of sulfuric acid<br>
which may be additionally required to achieve complete<br>
dissolution of the amount weighed in. The mixture is made up to<br>
approx. 100 ml with distilled water. Addition of approx. 2.5 to<br>
25 ml of NaOH (30%) adjusts the solution to a pH of from 8 to<br><br><br>
10. The solution is then heated to 70°C for at least a further<br>
5 minutes. Subsequently, 20 ml of KMnO4 solution (0.2 N) are<br>
added and the solution is heated to gentle boiling for at least<br>
30 min. The hot solution is acidified with H2SO4 (25 - 50 ml)<br>
and 20 ml of oxalic acid (0.2 N) are added in order to reduce<br>
manganese dioxide and excess KMnO4 to Mh2+. The oxalic acid<br>
solution added has to correspond exactly to the oxidation<br>
equivalents of the permanganate solution in its content of<br>
reduction equivalents. The clear solution is ultimately titrated<br>
with 0.2 N KMnO4 until a slight pink coloration is observed.<br>
Calculation:<br>
Every ml of 0.2 N KMnO4 solution consumed corresponds to 4.5 mg<br>
of formate. The percentage content of formate in the sample is<br>
found to be:<br>
[% formate] = [(ml of 0.2 N KMnO4 solution consumed) x (4.5 mg<br>
of formate/ml of 0.2 N KMnO4 solution) x 100)/(weight of sample<br>
in mg)]<br>
The method affords verified results for formate concentrations<br>
in the solution to be titrated between 0.08 and 0.5% by weight<br>
with deviations of 
+ /- 2% in the case of use of a 0.02 N permanganate solution.<br>
Owing to the dependence of the method accuracy on the formate<br>
concentration which is unknown per se, it may be necessary to<br>
align the sample weight first to an expected value in order to,<br>
after the first result is present, repeat the titration with an<br>
adjusted sample weight, which then gives rise to formate<br>
concentrations within the abovementioned range for the solution<br>
to be titrated.<br>
The formate contents of the samples from examples 3 and 5 are<br>
reported in table 1.<br><br><br>
The physical properties of the catalysts prepared are reported<br>
in table 2. Table 2a is based on the pulverulent catalysts,<br>
while the values from table 2b are based on catalysts which have<br>
been compressed to tablets having the dimensions of 6 x 4 mm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Methanol activity tests<br>
The oxidized tablets are quartered, and a screen fraction of<br>
from 2.5 to 3.5 mm is filled into a crude reactor and, after<br>
activation, subjected to a standardized activity test with<br>
periodically alternating temperatures. In the evaluation, the<br>
weight-time yields (WTY) in kg (methanol)/(kg (catalyst) x h)<br>
are determined as the mean for one period at constant<br>
temperature in each case. In a test reactor system consisting of<br>
6-16 individual tubes, in a test tube, the catalyst C79-7 from<br>
Sud-Chemie AG, Munich, Germany is used as a standard and the WTY<br>
determined for the other samples is in each case determined<br>
relative to the value for the standard. This process has the<br>
advantage that small variations, for example, in the synthesis<br>
gas composition are the same for all specimens, and the results<br>
from different test runs can thus be compared with one another.<br>
By-products are determined with the aid of gas chromatography<br>
analysis of condensate samples to which an internal standard has<br>
been added in each case. The values determined are likewise<br>
reported relative to the values which are obtained for the<br>
standard.<br>
The results of the methanol activity test are listed in table 3.<br><br><br><br>
