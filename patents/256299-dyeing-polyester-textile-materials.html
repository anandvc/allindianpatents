After dyeing in a process according to the invention, conventional washing and drying steps may be employed.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to the fiber material and textile material dyed with a dye mixture comprising a transition metal coordination compound, according to formula (I)<br>
The textile material dyed using a mixture comprising a transition metal coordination compound and a disperse dye provides dyed textile materials having good light fastness. Since the the textiles have light fasnesses under warm and humid conditions like they occur in closed cars or motor vehicles, this textile material dyed according to the invention is suitable for example as upholstery material in car manufacturing or any other application wherer improved light fastness is desired for example for an article of clothing or fo a sun blind or textiles for textiles for out door furnitures.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE<br>
17.5 parts of the pigment and disperse dye mixture (96% C.L Solvent Brown 53 and 4% C.L Disperse Red 86; this is the dye mixture from example 23a of table 1) with 32.5 parts of a commercial dispersing agent based on lignin sulphonates, and pulverized to a powder. 1.2 parts of this dye preparation are added to 2000 parts of demineralized water of 70°C, which contains 40 parts of ammonium sulfate; the pH value of the dye bath is set at 5 with 85% formic acid. 100 parts of washed polyester fiber fabric are placed in this dye bath, the container is closed, heated to 130°C over the course of 20 minutes, and dyeing continues for a further 60 minutes at this temperature. After cooling, the polyester fiber fabric is removed from the dye bath, rinsed, soaped and cleansed by reduction with sodium hydrosulphite in the usual way. After thermo-fixation (180°C, 30 min), a brownish pink dyeing is obtained with very good all-round fastness, especially fastness to light and sublimation, in particular excellent wet fastness.<br>
The dyed swatches were exposed to light by the fakra standard test. FAKRA is a test according to ISO 105/B02: Exposure in Xenotest 450 equipped with a Xenon arc source; black standard temperature 45 °C, relative humidity 45 ± 5 %. The number of cycles is indicated in tables as times this cycle: 2 cycles fakra means two cycles of this Fakra test; in DIN 75202/H: one cycle FAKRA is 54 hours exposure.<br>
Afterwards the adjacent fabrics are assessed by the Grey Scale Change ISO A03. This 5-step Grey Scale consists of 5 pairs of swatches of grey and white cloth which illustrate the perceived color differences corresponding to fastness ratings 5,4-5,4, etc. The fastness rating is that number of the Grey Scale which has a perceived color difference equal in magnitude to the perceived color difference between the original adjacent fabric and the treated adjacent fabric. An improvement of a value by 1 signifies an improvement of 20%<br>
The results are summarized in table 1, table 2, table 3 and table 4.<br>
In tables the amount of the dyes is given in percent of the polyester fiber material dyed in the respective dying bath. The ratio of the different components is also given as<br>
percentage of the total amount of dyestuff used in the dying bath. Eventually an additional UV Absorber is applied, for example a UV-absorber of formula A-S used in weight-% of dyed PES fiber material. The amount of the UV absorber is given in percent of the weight of the fabric treated. The results of the fakra test is given as explained above <br>
