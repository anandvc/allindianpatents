				<td>:2: FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a CAPD (Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis) Bag.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to a novel CAPD bag system in which the primary bag is made out of from a pair of Soft PVC Sheet, RF sealed from all four sides and is having a novel medication port, a reinforced Y tubing, a special connector with hood ribs support, a drainage bag provided with a novel sampling port free of tackiness. The system has novel breakaway valve and is so designed that there are no chances of contamination of fluid and convenient for the patient to remain infection free.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is performed for removal of toxic substances and metabolites normally received by the kidney. It is one of the most widely used method of treating the patients those possess kidney disorder. It is preferred method of treating the kidney patients over hemodialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis. The continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) procedure is intended to be a patients self case technique and is directed towards more freedom of movement to the patient during dialysis. CAPD generally aids in maintaining the fluid and electrolyte balance in the human body. The process of CAPD is accomplished by percutaneous or surgical implementation of a catheter in patients abdomen. In CAPD system, a dialysis<br><br>
:3:<br>
solution is introduced in the peritoneal cavity of the patient, allowed to remain there for few hours and then drained from the peritoneal cavity of e patient The basic principle of the dialysis is creating osmotic gradient across the peritoneal membrane. The dextrose in the CAPD solution makes it hypermolar which assists in the transfer of the toxic substances and metabolites present in high concentration in the blood plasma across the peritoneal membrane into the dialysite. The solution normally in CAPD bag does not contain potassium but the same can be added through medication port in case it is required.<br>
To achieve the above the several steps involved are connecting a dialysis solution to catheter connected to the patients peritoneal cavity in clamping the tubing between dialysis solution container and the patients peritoneal cavity to allow the dialysis solution to flow from he container to peritoneal cavity thereafter reclamping the tubing, allowing the dialysis solution to remain within the patients. Peritoneal cavity for desired hours, in clamping the tubing and draining the solutions from the patients peritoneal cavity back to dialysis solution container, disconnecting the dialysis solution container from the catheter tube and connecting to the catheter tube a fresh dialysis solution container and repeating the above steps again.<br>
US Patent No. 187008 describes equipment for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The equipment includes a flexible foldable plastic dialysis solution container having a transfer port A flexible tube having a line connector at its distal end extending from the transfer port for connecting to a liner connector carried by the<br><br>
:4:<br>
patients tube. The flexible tube carries a frangible member which normally blocks fluid flow but permits fluid flow after the frangible member is broken. A particulate filter and normally operable clamp are in series with the flexible tube. Peritoneal dialysis is carried out by connecting the liner connector from a fresh dialysis solution bag to the patient's tube liner connector breaking the frangible member and opening the clamp on the flexible tubing. After the dialysis solution is introduced into patients peritoneal cavity and remains there for a predetermined time the solution is drained back into the flexible bag, the liner connector are disconnected,<br>
US Patent no. 5037385 describes a wholly transplantable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system comprising a first port including tubing and second port including a pump and a further tubing serially interconnected for location as a shunt for a flow path for solution.<br>
US Patent no. 5642201 describes a peritoneal dialysis system of the continuous flow type which includes reverse osmosis unit which prepares sterilized and filtered water, dialysis concentrate and dextrose to provide dialysis fluid in dialysis production unit.<br>
US Patent no. 6245038 describes method, apparatus and kits for performing peritoneal dialysis. In this patent subcutaneous and transcutaneous systems are described.<br>
US Patent no. 629066 describes periotoneal dialysis apparatus including holder device for holding a container for dialysis fluid to be introduced into peritoneal chamber of<br><br>
:5:<br>
subject, a catheter device insertable through abdominal wall and a conduit device fluidly connecting the container to the catheter device. The apparatus has an agitator to enhance the rate of solute removal.<br>
US Patent no. 6497676 describes an automated peritoneal dialysis system and method for monitoring and controlling automated peritoneal dialysis therapy based on intra peritoneal process measured at a peritoneal near the end of patients catheter during fill, dwell and drain phase of automated peritoneal dialysis therapy.<br>
The existing peritoneal dialysis systems, the dialysis bags provided in the systems are not leakage proof. The existing dialysis bag assemblies are such that the shape of the dialysate bag does not allow total drainage of the diaiysate thus resulting in wastage of the solution. Further no protective container assembly is provided in the system. The breakaway valves used and designed for use in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system are not easily breakable. Also there is no surety that the flow of the fluid will be smooth and continuous after breaking the breakaway valve. Very often the breakaway valves blocks the flow of fluid due to the broken parts coming in the way. The medication ports used in the system and apparatus so far for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis are liable to get contaminated due to the latex being touched by hand. The needle also puncture the surface of the port. Also in some conditions if not used with due care there could be outflow or leakage of the fluid from the medication port. During the connections and disconnection of the transfer set from<br><br>
:6:<br>
the dralysate assembly, the touch of the human hands can cause contamination and infection in the patient.<br>
Therefore there always existed a need to improve upon the existing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system and apparatus which does not have the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a CAPD bag system Which has a protective container assembly.<br>
