Mumbai 400 001 Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to internal combustion engine and more particularly this relates to EGR Cooler, EGR Valve &amp; Water Distribution Rail assembly and mounting arrangement thereof on engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Water distribution rail is used to circulate coolant to various ports of engine for cooling. Water distribution rail is connected to coolant ports of the cylinder head and EGR cooler is used to cool EGR gases using coolant. These cooled EGR gases are used along with intake air to control emission. The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve mounting is integrated along with the EGR cooler on the hot steam side.<br>
Conventionally, separate mountings are provided for mounting EGR cooler, EGR valve &amp; water distribution rail. Conventionally water distribution rail is having round shape for coolant flow &amp; it is mounted on cylinder head ports &amp; EGR coolers are mounted separately. Coolant flows through hoses &amp; pipes from water distribution rail to EGR cooler &amp; EGR valve. In such cases, the number of mountings, overall weight &amp; dimensions of the engine compartment increase.<br>
Separate mountings for EGR cooler, EGR valve &amp; water distribution rail and the complication of too many ports and other components gives rise to manufacturing, assembly &amp; servicing problems.<br>
Thus to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies it is desirable to provide a common mounting for the EGR cooler, EGR valve &amp; the water distribution rail.In order to overcome the above drawbacks the said invention is devised.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide EGR Cooler, EGR Valve &amp; Water Distribution Rail assembly and mounting arrangement thereof on engine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide EGR Cooler, EGR Valve &amp; Water Distribution Rail assembly and mounting arrangement thereof on engine which is light in weight, compact in nature &amp; ease of assembly.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide EGR Cooler, EGR Valve &amp; Water Distribution Rail assembly and mounting arrangement thereof on engine which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
EGR Cooler, EGR Valve &amp; Water Distribution Rail assembly in accordance with this invention basically comprises of water distribution rail, EGR cooler, EGR valve, EGR pipes, Plurality of coolant hoses, Plurality of connecting pipes, clamps and fasteners.<br>
Wherein said water distribution rail is preferably having rectangular cross section and is provided with plurality of ribs on its outer surface to provide additional strength. Said water distribution rail is provided with plurality of through holes adopted to mount directly on the cylinder head of an engine. Said rail is provided with plurality of openings for coolant inflow and an opening for coolant flow to EGR cooler. Said rail is also provided with plurality of tapped openings to accommodate the mounting fasteners of EGR cooler.<br><br>
Said EGR cooler is provided with plurality of through holes on its outer surface for its mounting. Said EGR cooler is provided with tapped opening at one end to accommodate EGR valve and other end is also provided with tapped opening for mounting EGR pipe. Said EGR valve is mounted on EGR cooler.<br>
Said Water Distribution Rail is mounted on cylinder head of engine through the mounting fasteners. EGR cooler EGR valve and EGR pipe assembly is mounted on said water distribution rail through mounting fasteners. Said coolant hoses and pipes are connected between water distribution to EGR valve and from EGR valve to exit. Said coolant connecting pipe is supported through clamps.<br>
This arrangement helps in reducing the number of components used for mountings, sub-assemblies, water distribution rail, EGR valve &amp; EGR cooler. The rectangular shape of water distribution rail is designed to compact space without compromising the flow dynamics &amp; pressure drop. This provides compact space to integrate EGR cooler mounting along with water distribution rail for an internal combustion engine. O-ring sealing is provided between EGR cooler coolant inlet &amp; the water distribution rail. This reduces the additional flange mountings &amp; assembly. EGR valve mounted on the hot steam side &amp; mounting is integrated to EGR Cooler. The coolant inlet is connected from water distribution rail &amp; out let is connected to the EGR cooler coolant outlet.<br>
A Water distribution rail used for coolant flow, is mounted on Engine with the help of mounting bolts to circulate coolant through the engine, EGR valve &amp; EGR cooler. Coolant then passes to the cylinder head in the opening provided and reaches the water distribution rail. From the water distribution rail, plurality of branches is connected to the top water jacket of the cylinder head. Thus coolant from the water distribution rail is uniformly divided and fed into the cylinder head so that all the individual cylinders are uniformly cooled. EGR cooler is used to cool exhaust gases, which will be re-circulating to the engine along with the intake air, is<br><br>
mounted on the water distribution rail with the help of mounting bolts. Mounting for EGR valve is integrated with EGR cooler &amp; the coolant inlet is connected through hose between EGR valve &amp; water distribution rail. The coolant outlet from EGR valve is connected to EGR cooler outlet with the help of the tube. Coolant from water distribution rail is fed to the EGR cooler &amp; the outlet is connected to the thermostat.<br>
