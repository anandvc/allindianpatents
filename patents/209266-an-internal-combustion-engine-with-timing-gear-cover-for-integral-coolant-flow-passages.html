				<td>ENGINE TIMING GEAR COVER WITH INTEGRAL COOLANT FLOW PASSAGES<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine and in particular to an engine timing gear cover having integral coolant flow passages.<br>
2.        Description of Related Art<br>
The timing gear cover of the present invention is bolted to one end face of a cylinder block and provides a cover for the timing gear. The timing gear is disposed in a timing gear chamber that is formed by the face of the cylinder block and the timing gear cover The timing gear cover is further formed with integral fittings for coupling the timing gear cover to a radiator for both discharging cooiani to the radiator as well as receiving coolant from the radiator. The timing gear cover defines a water pump inlet chamber connected to the inlet coolant fitting that receives coolant from the radiator. The timing gear cover aiso forms a water pump outlet chamber that receives coolant from the water pump. The water pump outlet chamber communicates with a coolant inlet in the cylinder block for directing the coolant to the block. Coolant flows through the cylinder block and to the cylinder head in a known fashion and is discharged from the cylinder head to a hot coolant chamber also infpnraliv formed in the timinn gear cover The hot coolant chamber communicates with the discharge coolant fitting in the cover for discharge of the coolant to the radiator. The discharge coolant fitting also houses the thermostat.<br>
The timing gear cover is bolted to the cylinder block ana is not bolted to the cylinder head. Accordingly, a resilient seal is placed between the cylinder head and timing gear cover to ensure a leak proof coupling therebetween.<br>
The water pump Is mounted to the front of the timing gear cover. The water pump receives coolant through an opening in the timing gear cover to the water pump inlet chamber. The outlet of the water pump is directed through another opening in the timing gear cover to the water pump outlet chamber for flow of coolant to the cylinder block.<br>
The timing gear cover also includes a coolant bypass from the hot coolant<br><br>
chamber to the pump-inlet chamber to allow coolant circulation through the engine prior to the thermostat openinn A novel aspect of the timing aear cover is the placement of the water pump Not chamber between the water pump outlet chamber and the timing gear chamber. As a result, any leak of coolant from the higher-pressure water pump outlet chamber win flow into the lower pressure water pump inlet chamber: The coolant doss not flow into the timing-gear chamber where the coolant would contaminate the engine lubricating oil. Tnis arrangement of the coolant chambers in the timing gear cover improves the reliability of the engine by eliminating or minimizing the likelihood of coolant leaks into the lubricating oil.<br>
The integration of the thermostat housing into the timing gear cover with an integral bypass is another novel aspect of the invention.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying Prawinqs<br>
Fig, 1 is an exploded perspective view of tne front portion of an internal combustion engine.<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the rear or inside surface of the timing gear cover.<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged perspective view of the water pump.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, the front portion of an internal combustion engine is shown. The engine is an inline, multiple cylinder engine. Shown is the front face 12 of the cylinder block 14 as well as the front face 16, of the cylinder head 18, The terms "front" and "rear" are used for purposes of explanation oniy and are not intended as limitations. Also shown are a timing gear cover 20 and a water pump 22. The timing gear cover is mounted to the block 14 by a plurality of bolts 24 that extend through apertures 26 in the timing gear cover and into threaded apertures 28 in the block 14. The water pump 22 includes a pump housing 30 that is mounted to the cover 20 by a some of the bolte 24 fhat extend through apertures 32 in the housing 30 and through apertures 26 in the timing gear cover and into the threaded<br>
2<br><br>
apertures 28 in the block.<br>
The timing gear cover 20 is shown in both Flg; 1 and Fig, 2, The timing gear cover is somewhat pan shaped, having a front wall 36 and an upstanding sidewall 
The engine crankshaft extends through the aperture 48 in the timing gear cover. The ol! pump (not shown) is placed in the circular boss 50 surrounding the aperture 48. The oil pump inlet is shown at 52.<br>
The timing gear cover is integrally formed with a coolant inlet fitting 54 for connection to a hose to receive coolant from a radiator. The cover is atso integrally formed with a coolant discharge fitting 53. The coolant discharge fitting 56 also serves as the thermostat housing and is the connection for a radiator hose to deliver coolant from the engine to the radiator=<br>
The coolant inlet fitting 54 directs coolant into a water pump inlet chamber 58 that is defined" by the upstanding intermediate walls 40, 42 as well as the cover front wall 36 and the front face of the engine block, Coolant flows from the chamber 58 through an aperture 60 into the water pump mounted to the opposite side of the wall 36. The pump returns the coolant through the opening 62 in the wall 36 and into a water pump outlet chamber 64. The chamber 64 is formed by the upstanding intermediate wall 42 as well as th© upstanding sidewall 38, together with the front wall 36 and the block front face 12. Coolant flows from the chamber 64 into the engine block through the opening 66 in the front face of the block. The coolant then flows through the block, around the cylinders and then upward, into the cylinder head 18 in a conventional manner.<br>
Coolant flows from the cylinder head 18 through an opening 68: and into a hot coolant chamber 68 in the cover 20. From the chamber 68 the coolant flows through the discharge fitting 56, past the thermostat (not shown) and back to the radiator. A<br>
3<br><br>
resilient gasket 70 is mounted to the timing gear coven in , seal groove surrounding the opening in to the chamber 68. The resilient gasket 70 is made of rubber or synthetic material capable of withstanding (he high cooiani tomperatures without degradation. The resilient gasket 70 is required as the timing gear cover is bolted solely to the engine block, and is not bolted to the cylinder head,<br>
A coolant bypass port 72 is formed in ths wall between the hot coolant chamber 68 and the pump inlet chamber 58. This bypass allows coolant to circulate through the engine when the thermostat is closed.<br>
The timing gear 20 includes a timing'gear chambsr 74 defined gomraWy by the upstanding sidewaHs 38 and the upstanding intermediate wall 40. The timing gear chamber 74 communicates with the engine lubricating oil used to lubricate the timing gear and chain. The timing gear cover is configured such that the lower pressure water pump inlet chamber 58 completely surrounds and separates the higher pressure water pump outlet chamber 64 from the timing gear chamber 74-Thus, any coolant leaking from the higher pressure chamber 64 will Row into the water pump inlet chamber rather than flowing into the timing gear chamber where the coolant would contaminate the lubricating oif. The arrangement of me coolant chambers in the timing gear cover improvesjhe reliability of the origins 10 by reducing or eliminating trie possibility of coolant leaking into the lubricating oil.<br>
The water pump housing 30 includes a drain fitting 76 to enable coolant to be drainad from the engine block and head. By placing the drain fitting 76 in the water pump housing, fewer machining operations in the block 12 are required. The drain fitting can be added to the smaller water pump housing at a lower cost.<br>
The water pump 22 is shown in grsstor dQtaii in Fig. 3. ThG pump incfudos an impeller 78 having a plurality of vanes SO. The impeller 78 rotates in a clockwise direction as shown in Fig. 3 to move the coolant outward from the impeller and throush the chamber 82 in tho pump housing 30. The coolant then flows through the opening 63 in the timing gear cover to the water pump outlet chamber 64.<br>
The timing gear cover provides an integral one-piece rtuctun forming Mh the inlot and outlet Mings for coolant flow to and from the "nof". oodaift flow path through the cover is designed for high reliability by isolating the<br>
4<br><br>
higher-pressure pump outlet chamber from the timing gear chamber.<br>
