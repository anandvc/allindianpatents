DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of a building equipped with an escape system constructed and operative in accordance with, a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 1, there is provided an evacuation system for a building preferably comprising a plurality of selectably lowerable, multiple-platform, generally vertical transporters 100, each arranged for selectable communication with multiple floors of a building 102. Control outputs preferably provided by a central controller 104 or alternatively by multiple . controllers, each assignable to a given, transporter 100, selectably lower multiple-platforms 106 of the transporters 100 from multiple floors to at least one egress level 108 at which egress of persons may safely occur.<br>
It is. appreciated that a given building, such as building 102, may include one or more transporters 100. In the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 1, multiple transporters 100 are shown in various operative orientations. For example, a transporter designated by reference numeral 110 is shown hi a deployment orientation and a transporter 120 is shown in apre-evacuation egress orientation.<br>
Human control inputs to controller 104 or directly to transporters 100 may be provided, for example, by one or more of an operator 122 at the controller 104, an operator 124 on the ground, an operator hi a fire engine 126 and a remote operator 128, communicating via a data network, such as the Internet or an emergency network.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, each of the transporters 100 preferably comprises a plurality of stackable platforms 106, arranged to be supported on multiple generally vertical supports, the plurality of platforms 106 being arranged in mutually spaced relationship, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for transporter 110, each hi communication with a. different floor of building 102 for evacuation loading. The plurality of platforms 106 are preferably arranged in a mutually collapsed relationship when not in use, as clearly seen inFig.2A.<br>
Following egress of evacuated persons from platforms 106, the platforms 106 are arranged hi a side by side relationship, as shown clearly in Fig. 2P.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 1, each of the plurality of platforms 106 preferably comprises a bottom support surface 132 and a peripheral enclosing element 134, such as a wall element formed of fabric or rigid sheets or a combination . thereof, preferably a heat resistant, fire resistant and/or smoke impermeable material. Preferably, the interior of peripheral enclosing element 134 is pressurized so as to reduce, insofar as possible, the ingress of smoke and noxious gases thereto. Pressurization is preferably provided by an electrically operated fan, such as a centrifugal blower, 135, which is preferably associated with an air filter 136, such as an activated carbon filter.<br>
Enclosing element 134 may constitute a protective railing or restraining . band rather than..a complete, wall.. Enclosing element-134 is preferably.designed.to..,., provide low aerodynamic drag to reduce wind forces on the platform 106. Preferably at least one building mounted stabilizing element cooperates with each transporter for stabilizing the transporter against lateral forces, such as wind forces. In the illustrated embodiment, vertical guides 137, such as rails or cables, are provided at suitable locations along building 102.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 1, where a plurality of transporters 100 are provided, the controller 104 is preferably operative to individually control individual transporters 100 such that multiple platforms 106 of different transporters may be simultaneously positioned in communication with different groups of multiple floors of the building for simultaneous evacuation loading. The multiple floors may or may not be contiguous.<br>
The transporters may also be employed for lifting persons, such as<br>
firefighters or other rescue personnel, and/or equipment, from the egress level or other<br>
building levels to multiple levels of the building.	.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H, 21,23, 2JC, 2L, 2M, 2N, 20, 2P, 2Q, 2R and 2S, which illustrate .typical operation of the evacuation system of Fig. 1.

Selectable pivotal orientation of deployment frame 168 preferably is provided by a pair of hydraulic'pistons 174.<br>
Turning to the platform deployment assembly, mounted onto transporter top frame 158 is a stacked platform selectable release assembly (not shown), which preferably comprises a wireless control communicator (which is similar to wireless control communicator 192 of PCT application PCT/EL2003/00080986 incorporated herein by reference) which, inter alia, governs the operation of a stacked platform selectable release motor/brake assembly (similar to motor/brake assembly 194 PCT application PCT/EL2003/00080986) which operates a rotatable shaft (similar to rotatable shaft 196 of PCT application PCT/IL2003/00080986), onto ends of which are mounted pulleys 198. Preferably cables 200 are wound onto pulleys 198. These cables are<br>
coupled to the lowest platform 106 such that deployment of platforms 106 is governed by the motor/brake assembly.<br>
Fig. 2A shows a plurality of stacked platforms 106 held tightly below transporter top frame 158 by cables 200. Each of the stacked platforms 106 preferably includes a pair of building mounted guide riding roller assemblies (not shown in Fig. 2A), which are adapted for vertically slidable operative engagement with building mounted vertical rails or guides, such as vertical guides 137. As will be described hereinbelow in greater detail, each of the stacked platforms 106 includes a selectably positionable evacuation bridge (not shown in Fig. 2A).<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2B, which illustrates the mechanism of ...Fig. 2A following lateral and downwardly yertical.displacement of transporter top frame . 158 and stacked platforms 106 provided by rotation of deployment frame 168 about axes 170 and 171 produced by maximum retraction of pistons 174 to an orientation, shown in- Fig. 2B, wherein locating pins 202 on deployment frame 168 are seated in sockets 203 on static frame 172.<br>
Fig. 2B additionally illustrates initial engagement of building mounted guide riding roller assemblies 204 with vertical, guides 137, resulting inter alia from lowering of platforms 106 together with transporter top frame 158 produced by playing out of cables 150, 152, 154 and 156 by winch/brake assembly 144. It is seen that assemblies 204 preferably include at least three rollers 206 mounted on a generally peripheral support 208.

It is seen that peripheral enclosing element 134 is beginning to be unfolded in an accordion-like manner.<br>
It is also seen that foldable support elements 220 and 222 interconnect the transporter top frame 158 with the platform 106 lying therebelow and similar support elements interconnect the individual stacked platforms 106 with each other and support their weight and the weight of loads applied thereto. When the platforms 106 are in a stacked orientation as shown in Figs. 2A &amp; 2B, the foldable-support'elements<br>
220 and 222 are folded, however, when the platforms 106 are fully deployed at then-intended spaced mutual orientations, the support elements are unfolded and tensioned and define the spacing between vertically adjacent platforms 106.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig.. 2D, which illustrates a topmost platform 106 of a transporter 100 being fully deployed, and its peripheral enclosing element 134 being fully tensioned, with the remaining platforms 106 and peripheral enclosing elements 134 being in a stacked not-yet fully deployed orientation.

It is appreciated that the peripheral enclosing element 134 is maintained in . its.open orientation.hy.structural locking .thereof..<br>
Fig. 2E illustrates transporter 100 when all of the platforms 106 have been fully deployed and peripheral enclosing elements 134 of each platform .106 are fully tensioned. Normally deployment of each platform 106 and tensioning of its peripheral enclosing element takes place sequentially from the top to the bottom of the transporter. It is seen mat each peripheral enclosing element 134 includes egress opening 230 and has associated therewith a selectably positionable evacuation bridge. It is appreciated that the peripheral enclosing element 134 of each platform 106 is maintained in its open orientation by structural locking thereof.<br>
Fig. 2F shows the fully deployed platforms 100 being lowered, preferably by action of winch/brake assembly 144 (Fig. 2E) into a desired vertical position relative to building 102, such that each of platforms 106 is properly aligned with a separate building floor, here designated by reference numeral 236.

Reference is now made to Fig. 2G, which illustrates a platform 106 deployed in proper vertical alignment with a building floor 236, such that evacuation bridge 232 is positioned opposite an emergency evacuation door 238. An authorized individual, such as an evacuation team leader, typically employs an evacuation emergency key 240 to open emergency evacuation door 238. Fig. 2H shows the evacuation team leader positioning evacuation bridge 232, while Fig. 21 shows evacuation of persons from building floor 236 onto platform 106 within peripheral<br>
enclosing element 134. It is appreciated that evacuation of multiple building floors onto multiple platforms 106 of one or more transporters 100 may take place simultaneously.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2J, which shows the evacuation team leader folding up the evacuation bridge 232. It is appreciated that the evacuation team leader may then secure the evacuation bridge to the peripheral enclosing element 134 to serve as a security gate. Fig. 2K illustrates an optional structure wherein passageways, typically including trap doors 242 and ladders 244, enable people to move between platforms 106 in a transporter 100.<br>

Fig. 2N illustrates the next lowest platform 106 being lowered to the egress level 108 as the lowest platform slides along displacement track 250 out of engagement with and away from vertical guides 137, on rollers 252, as foldable support elements 220 and 222 pivot &gt; to accommodate the transverse displacement It is appreciated that alternatively, displacement track may not be inclined, and motion of the lowest platform 106 along displacement track 250 may then be achieved by mounting a motor on platform 106, by having an operator use a pulley to pull the platform along the track, by force applied by the descent of the above platform 106 and the support elements 220 and 222 thereof, or in any other suitable way.<br>
Fig. 20 shows the sequential lowering and concomitant transverse displacement of the platforms 106, with the lowest platform 106 coming to rest at the end of inclined track 250, at a location defined by stoppers 254. Fig. 2P shows all of the platforms 106 at the egress level 108, preferably prior to egress of persons therefrom. Preferably, all of the platforms reach the egress level 108 within a time duration of less than two minute between the operative orientations shown in Figs. 2M - 2P.

Preferably thereafter egress of persons from all of the platforms 106 via egress openings 230 takes place generally simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 2Q. It is<br>
 <br>
noted that during lowering of the platforms 106, the support elements 220 and 222 effectively block the opening of egress openings 230 and thus prevent inadvertent opening thereof.<br>
It is appreciated that the transporter 100 may be employed for raising rescue personnel or firefighters to selected floors of building 102, as shown in Figs. 2R and 2S.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 3A - 3E, which illustrate an alternative mode of operation of the structure of Figs. 1 - 2S.

Fig. 3B shows the platforms 306 in engagement with an inclined track 350 at an egress level 308. Typically, inadvertent motion of platforms 306 along track 350 is stopped by mechanical stoppers or in any other suitable way.<br>
Fig. 3C shows deployment of the platforms 306 under control of rescue personnel by sequentially raising and unfolding the platforms'. It is appreciated that at this stage the rescue personnel may remove the cable connecting the platforms 306.
