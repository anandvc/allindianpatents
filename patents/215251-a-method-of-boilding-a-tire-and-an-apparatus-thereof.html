Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting the same, Figure 1 shows a plan view of a tire building apparatus 10. The tire building apparatus 10 is designed to build a number of tires simultaneously in a step-by-step process. Preferably, the tire building apparatus 10 partially builds five tire carcasses simultaneously at peak performance.<br><br>
The tire building apparatus 10 includes three turrets 16,18, 20. The first turret 16 has two drum shafts 26,28 that extend from the turret in generally opposite directions. Drums 34,36 are mounted on the ends of the drum shafts 26,28 of the first turret 16. The first turret 16 is rotatable in a manner such that drums 34,36 rotate between a first station I and a second station II. At an initial point of tune, drum 34 is located at the first station I, while drum 36 is located at the second station II. When the first turret 16 rotates, drum 34 moves to the second station II and drum 36 moves to the first station I.<br>
The second turret 18 has two drum shafts 50,52 that extend from the turret in generally opposite directions. Drums 58,60 are mounted on the ends of the drum shafts 50,52 of the second turret 18. The second turret 18 is rotatable in a manner such that drums 58,60 are moved between a third station III and a fourth station IV. At an initial point of time, drum 58 is located at the third station III, while drum 60 is located at the fourth station IV. When<br>
the second turret 18 rotates, drum 58 is moved to the fourth station IV and drum 60 is moved to the third station III. The first turret 16, the drum shafts 26, 28 of the first turret, the second<br><br>
turret 18, and the drum shafts 50,52 of the second turret are preferably in general alignment with one another.<br>
The third turret 20 has two drum shafts 74,76 that extend from the turret in generally opposite directions. Drums 82,84 are mounted on the ends of the drum shafts 74,76 of the third turret 20. The third turret 20 rotates in a manner such that drums 82,84 are moved between<br>
*<br>
a fifth station V and a sixth station VI. At an initial point in time, drum 82 is located at the fifth station V, while drum 84 is located at the sixth station VI. When the third turret 20 rotates, drum 82 is moved to the sixth station VI and drum 84 is moved to the fifth station V. The third turret 20 and the drum shafts 74,76 of the third turret are preferably in a generally axial alignment with the first turret 16 and second turret 18.<br>
At the first station I, there are means for applying a tire component to drums 34,36, such as a liner by an applicator 100 that is fed by a liner conveyor 102. The first station I also has a means for applying a tire component to drums 34,36, such as a sidewall by an applicator 108 that may be fed by a sidewall conveyor 110. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the liner applicator 100 and the sidewall applicator 108 are positioned on opposite sides of the axis x-x. The liner applicator 100 first applies the liner to one of the drums 34,36, and then the sidewall applicator 108 applies the sidewalls.<br>
At the second station II there is located toeguard applying means such as toeguard applicator 116 for applying a toeguard to the drums 34,36. Also, means for applying other tire components such as plies and a wedge to the drums, by a first ply applicator 122, a second ply applicator 124, and a wedge applicator 130 located at the second station II. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the toeguard applicator 116 and the first ply applicator 122 are on one side of the axis x-x, and the second ply applicator 124 and the wedge applicator 130 are on the opposite side of the axis. The toeguard is preferably applied first at the second station II, and then the first ply is applied. Thereafter, the second ply and the wedge are applied.<br>
At the fifth station V there are located means for applying another tire component such as a breaker to the drums 82,84, by a first breaker applicator 136 and a second breaker applicator 138. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first breaker applicator 136 is on one side of the axis x-x, and the second breaker applicator 138 is on the opposite side of the axis x-x. Preferably, the first breaker is applied to either of the drums 82,84 by the first breaker applicator 136, and then the second breaker is applied by the second breaker applicator 138.<br><br>
At the sixth station VI there are located means for applying additional tire components such as a tread, by a tread applicator 144. At the sixth station VI there may also be located means for applying other tire components such as a spiral overlay, with a spiral overlay applicator 150 if high-performance tires are being produced by the tire building apparatus 10.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, a first transfer unit 156 is located between the first<br>
*<br>
turret 16 and the second turret 18. The first transfer unit 156 picks up the tire components after they are assembled in the form of a band 158 on one of the drums 34,36 at the first station I and second station II and transfers the band from the first station I to one of the drums 58,60 at the third station III. The first transfer unit 156 also contains a bead loading apparatus 160 for applying beads to the band 158 as the band is transferred from the first station I to the third station III. The first transfer unit 156 preferably has a cylindrical or substantially cylindrical support structure 164 fitted with radially movable shoes 166 that grip the band 158. The support structure 164 is moved axially of the apparatus 10 over one of the drums 34,36 and the movable shoes 166 are moved radially inward to grip the band 158. The first transfer unit 156 then transports the band 158 from one of the drums 34,36 to one of the waiting drums 58,60 at the third station III, where the support structure 164 surrounds the waiting drum and places the band over the drum. The band 158 is then released by the movable shoes 166, and the first transfer unit 156 moves away from the drum.<br>
At the third station III, the band 158 is shaped on one of the drums 58,60 of the second turret 18 as the turret rotates the band to the fourth station IV.<br>
A second transfer unit 170 is located between the second turret 18 and the third turret 20. The second transfer unit 170 is axially movable to transfer a complete breaker and tread package from the fifth station V and to place it around the band 158 waiting at the fourth station IV. The second transfer unit 170 preferably operates in the same manner as the first transfer unit 156 as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Although five tires may be built simultaneously on the tire building apparatus 10, Figures 3-9 follow the production of one tire on the tire building apparatus to illustrate the timing and steps involved in the process. Figure 3 shows the beginning step of tire construction on the tire building apparatus 10. First, the inner liner is applied at the first station I to the drum 34 by liner applicator 100. Then the sidewall is applied by sidewall applicator 108. Next, the sidewall is automatically spliced, or in some cases manually spliced by a worker. After the sidewall is spliced, the first turret 16 is rotated moving the drum 34 from the first station I to the second station II. At approximately the same time, the first breaker is applied to drum 82<br><br>
at the fifth station V of the third turret 20 by the first breaker applicator 136. Next, the second breaker is applied on top of the first breaker on drum 82 by the second breaker applicator 138. After the second breaker is applied, the third turret 20 is rotated, moving drum 82 from the fifth station V to the sixth station VI.<br>
Figure 4 shows the tire building apparatus 10 with drum 34 rotated to the second station<br>
*<br>
II and drum 82 rotated to the sixth station VI. At the second station II, the liner is stitched. After the stitching of the liner, the toeguard is then applied by the toeguard applicator 116. The first ply is then applied by the first ply applicator 122. The second ply is applied by the second ply applicator 124. Finally the wedge is applied by the wedge applicator 133. After the wedge is applied, the first turret 16 is rotated, moving the drum 34 with the band 158 comprised of liner, sidewall, toeguard, plies, and wedge back to the first station I to await transfer to the third station III. The drum 34 may be expanded before or after application of any component to the place the component in tension and remove trapped air. At the sixth station VI, the spiral overlay may be applied by the spiral overlay applicator 150 on top of the breakers if required, or the drum 82 may sit idle for a period of time until a tread is applied on top of the breakers. The tread is then applied by the tread applicator 144, and then the tread is manually spliced if required. The third turret 20 is then rotated, moving drum 82 back to the fifth station V to await transfer to the fourth station IV.<br>
Figure 5 shows the first transfer unit 156 moved into position to remove the band 158 from the drum 34 and move it to the drum 58 at the third station III. Beads may be applied to the band 158 at the first station I or at the third station III by a bead loading apparatus 160 connected to the first transfer unit 156.<br>
Figure 6 shows the next step of the production of a tire carcass as the second transfer unit 170 is moved into position to pick up the breaker and tread package from drum 82 at the fifth station V.<br>
Figure 7 shows the first transfer unit 156 in position to place the band 158 on the drum 58 at the third station III. After the band 158 is transferred to the drum 58 at the third station III, the second turret 18 is rotated, moving the drum 58 to the fourth station IV. As the second turret 18 is rotated, the drum 58 inflates to shape the band 158 and turns up part of the band around the beads. Further turn-up may be required as the drum 58 remains at the fourth station IV awaiting the breaker and tread package to complete the shaping and turn-up. A stitching device of the type commonly used in the art then may be used to stitch the sidewall.<br><br>
'Figure 8 shows the second transfer unit 170 in position for placing the breaker and tread package onto the band 158 at the fourth station IV. The second turret 18 is then rotated, moving the drum 58 back to the third station III after the second transfer unit 170 moves back to a neutral position as shown in Figure 9. At the third stationIII, the breaker and tread package is stitched. The tire carcass, now ready to be vulcanized, is removed from the tire building apparatus 10 by a tire remover 180 at the third station III. A tire carcass is removed from the tire building apparatus 10 approximately once every 35-40 seconds.<br>
Figure 10 shows an alternate embodiment of the present invention where an injection molded tread is placed directly over the breaker at the sixth station VI. The injection molded tread either is removed from the injector body 184 directly by a pick-up apparatus 188 or is stored and then loaded onto the pick-up apparatus. The pick-up apparatus 188 may use a pick-up shoe to grasp the injection molded tread, or, as shown in Figure 10, the pick-up apparatus may have a vacuum ring 190 that grasps and holds the injection molded tread in place. The pick-up apparatus 188 then transfers the injection molded tread to the sixth station VI and places the tread, onto the drum 82 holding the breakers. If the pick-up shoe is used in the pick-up apparatus 188, then the shoe simply releases the injection molded tread. If the vacuum ring 190 is used in the pick-up apparatus 188, then air in the vacuum ring is removed to create a vacuum that holds the injection molded tread in place, and the tread is removed by allowing air into the vacuum ring, thereby eliminating the vacuum and releasing the tread.<br>
The preferred embodiments have been described, hereinabove. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above methods may incorporate changes and modifications without departing from the general scope of this invention. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<br>
