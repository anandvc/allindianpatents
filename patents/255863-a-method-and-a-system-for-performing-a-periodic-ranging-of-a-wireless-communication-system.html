BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
 The present invention relates generally to a system and a method for a<br>
periodic ranging in a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system,<br>
and more particularly to a system and a method for performing a periodic ranging<br>
of a Mobile Station(MS) that remains in a sleep mode.	<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is the next<br>
generation communication system, research is being performed to provide users<br>
with services having various Qualities of Service (QoSs) at a high speed. In<br>
particular, in the current 4G communication system, research has been actively<br>
pursued to support a high speed service capable of ensuring mobility and QoS in<br>
a BWA communication system such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN)<br>
system and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system.<br>
A representative communication system of the 4G communication system<br>
is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 802.16a<br>
communication system and an IEEE 802.16e communication system. The IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system and the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
utilize an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme/an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme to support a<br>
broadband transmission network for a physical channel of the wireless MAN<br>
system. The IEEE 802.16a communication system considers only a single cell<br>
structure and stationary subscriber stations (SSs), which means the system does<br>
not accommodate the mobility of the SSs at all. However, the IEEE 802.16e<br><br>
communication system accommodates the mobility of an SS in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system. Here, an SS having mobility is referred to as a Mobile<br>
Station (MS).<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically illustrating a conventional IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system has a multi-cell structure, i.e., a cell 100 and a cell 150.<br>
Further, the IEEE 802.16e communication system induces a Base Station(BS)<br><br>
110 that controls the cell 100, a BS 140 that controls the cell 150, and a plurality<br>
of MSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153. The transmission|reception of signals<br>
between the BSs 110 and 140 and the MSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153 is<br>
accomplished using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme.	<br>
In FIG. 1, the MS 130 is located in a boundary area (or a handover area)<br>
cell 150 controlled by the BS 140 while communicating with the BS 110, a<br>
serving BS of the MS 130 changes from the BS 110 to the BS 140.<br>
Because the IEEE 802.16e communication system accommodates the<br>
mobility of an MS, power consumption of the MS is an important factor in the<br>
entire system. Accordingly, a sleep mode operation and an awake mode operation<br>
corresponding to the sleep mode operation between the MS and the BS have been<br>
proposed to minimize the power consumption of the MS. More specifically, the<br>
MS periodically performs a ranging operation for compensating for a timing<br>
offset, a frequency offset, and power with the BS in order accommodate changes<br>
in channel conditions with the BS.<br>
Further, because the IEEE 802.16e communication System accommodates<br>
the mobility of an MS, a periodic ranging of the ranging operation is growing<br>
more important.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating a conventional sleep<br>
mode operation in the IEEE 802.16e communication system. However, before a<br>
description of FIG. 2 is given, it should be noted that the sleep mode has been<br>
proposed in order to minimize power consumption of an MS in an idle interval, in<br>
which packet data are not transmitted, when the packet data are transmitted. That<br>
is, in the sleep mode, the MS and a BS simultaneously transit to the sleep mode,<br>
thereby minimizing the power consumption of the MS in the idle interval in<br>
which the packet data is not transmitted.	<br><br><br>
More specifically, the packet data is burst when generated. Accordingly, it<br>
is unreasonable that the same operation is performed in both an interval in which<br>
the packet data are not transmitted and an interval in which the packet data are<br>
transmitted. Therefore, the sleep mode operation as described above has been<br>
proposed.<br><br>
When packet data to be transmitted is generated while both the MS and<br>
the BS are in the sleep mode, the MS and the BS must simultaneously transit to<br>
the awake mode and must transmit/receive the packet data. <br>
The sleep mode operation described above is proposed not only in terms<br>
of power consumption but also as a scheme for minimizing interference between channel signals. However,because traffic has a large influence on the packet data<br>
character, the sleep mode operation must be performed in consideration of the<br>
traffic characteristic, the transmission scheme characteristic, etc., of the packet<br>
data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a reference numeral 211 identifies the generation<br>
pattern of packet data and includes a plurality of ON intervals and OFF intervals.<br>
The ON intervals are burst intervals in which packet data (or traffic) is generated<br>
and the OFF intervals are idle intervals in which the traffic is not generated. The<br><br>
MS and the BS are transited to a sleep mode and an awake mode according to the<br>
traffic generation pattern as described above, such that the power consumption of<br>
the MS can be minimized and interference between channel signals can be<br>
prevented.<br>
Reference numeral 213 identifies the mode transition of a BS and an MS,<br>
and includes a plurality of awake modes and sleep modes In the awake modes,<br>
traffic is generated and packet data is exchanged. In the sleep modes, the traffic is<br>
not generated and the packet data is not exchanged between the MS and the BS.<br>
Reference numeral 215 identifies the MS power level. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2, when the MS power level is K in the awake mode, the MS power level is<br>
M in the sleep mode. When the MS power level K in the awake mode is<br>
compared with the MS power level M in the sleep mode, the M has a value much<br>
smaller than that of the K. That is, because the packet data s not exchanged in the<br>
sleep mode, the power of the MS is not consumed as much.<br>
In order to transit to the sleep mode, an MS must receive a mode<br>
transition approval from a BS. The BS approves a mode transition to a sleep<br>
mode of the MS and transmits packet data. Further, the BS must inform the MS<br>
that packet data to be transmitted to the MS exists during a listening interval of<br>
the MS. Herein, the MS must awake from the sleep mode and confirm if there is<br>
packet data to be transmitted from the BS to the MS. The listening interval will be<br>
described later in more detail.	<br><br>
As a result of the confirmation by the MS, when there is the packet data<br>
to be transmitted from the BS to the MS, the MS transits to the awake mode and<br>
receives the packet data from the BS. However, when there is no packet data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS to the MS, the MS may return to the sleep mode or<br>
maintain the awake mode.	<br>
 Parameters required for supporting the sleep mode operation and the<br>
awake mode operation will be described herein below.	<br>
(1)	Sleep Identifier (SLPID)	<br>
The SLPID proposed by the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
corresponds to a value allocated through a Sleep-Response, (SLP-RSP) message<br>
when the MS transits to the sleep mode, which is used as a Specific value for only<br>
MSs staying in the sleep mode. That is, the SLPID is an identifier for<br>
differentiating MSs in the sleep mode including a listening interval. When the<br>
corresponding MS transits to the awake mode, an SLPID is (restored to the BS and<br>
may be reused for an MS intended to transit to the sleep mode through the SLP-<br>
RSP message. The SLPID has a size of 10 bits and it is possible to support 1024<br>
MSs performing the sleep mode operation using the SLPID.<br>
(2)	Sleep interval<br>
The sleep interval, which is requested by the MS, may be allocated by the<br>
BS according to the request of the MS. The sleep interval is a time interval for<br>
which the MS transits to the sleep mode and then maintains the sleep mode until<br>
the listening interval starts. The sleep interval may be defined as a time for which<br>
the MS stays in the sleep mode.<br>
The MS may continuously stay in the sleep mode when there is no data to<br>
be transmitted from the BS to the MS, even after the sleep interval. In such a case,<br>
the MS increases and updates the sleep interval by a preset initial-sleep window<br>
value and a final-sleep window value. The initial-sleep window value represents<br>
an initial minimum value of the sleep interval and the final-sleep window value<br>
represents a final maximum value of the sleep interval. The initial-sleep window<br>
value and the final-sleep window value may be expressed by the number of<br>
frames. The initial-sleep window value and the final-sleep window value will be<br>
described later in more detail.	<br><br>
The listening interval, which is requested by the MS, may be allocated by<br><br>
the BS according to the request of the MS. That is, the listening interval is a time<br>
interval for which the MS awakes from the sleep mode momentarily,<br>
synchronizes with a downlink signal of the BS, and receives downlink messages<br><br>
such as traffic indication (TRF-IND) messages. The TRF-IND message identifies<br>
. if there is a TRF-IND, i.e., packet data, to be transmitted to the MS. The TRF-<br>
IND message will be described later in more detail.<br><br>
The MS continuously waits to receive the TRF-IND message for the<br>
listening interval. If a bit representing the MS in an SLPID bitmap included in the<br>
TRF-IND message has a value indicating a positive indication, the MS<br>
continuously maintains the awake mode. As a result, the MS transits to the awake<br>
'	<br>
mode. However, if the bit has a value indicating a negative indication, the MS<br>
transits to the sleep mode again.<br>
3) Sleep interval update algorithm<br>
When the MS shifts to the sleep mode, the MS determines the sleep<br>
interval from a preset minimum window value as a minimum sleep mode period.<br>
After the MS awakes from the sleep mode for the listening interval and confirms<br>
an absence of packet data to be transmitted from the BS, the MS sets the sleep<br>
interval to have a value corresponding to twice that of the previous sleep interval,<br>
and remains in the sleep mode. For example, when the minimum window value is<br>
2, the MS sets the sleep interval to 2 frames, and remains in the sleep mode for<br>
the 2 frames. After the 2 frames pass, the MS awakes from the sleep mode and<br>
determines if the TRF-IND message has been received. When the TRF-IND<br>
message has not been received, i.e., when there is no packet data transmitted from<br>
the BS to the MS, the MS sets the sleep interval to be 4 frames, which is twice as<br><br>
many as 2 frames, and remains in the sleep mode for the 4 frames. Accordingly,<br>
the sleep interval may increase from the minimum window value to the maximum<br>
window value, and an update algorithm for the sleep internal is the sleep interval<br>
update algorithm.<br>
Messages defined in the IEEE 802.16e communication system for<br>
supporting the sleep mode operation and the awake mode operation as described<br>
above will be described herein below.<br>
(1) Sleep Request (SLP-REQ) message	<br>
The SLP-REQ message is transmitted from an MS to a BS, which is a<br>
message used when the MS requests a mode transition to a sleep mode. The SLP-<br><br>
REQ message includes parameters, i.e., information elements (IEs), required<br>
when the MS operates in the sleep mode. A format of the SLP-REQ message is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><br>
The SLP-REQ message is a dedicated message transmitted based on a<br>
connection ID (CID) of an MS.<br>
The Management message type IE represents the type of message being<br>
transmitted. For example, when the Management message type has a value of 45,<br><br>
the transmitted message is the SLP-REQ message.<br>
The initial-sleep window value IE represents a requested start value for<br>
the sleep interval (e.g., measured in frames), and the final-sleep window value<br>
represents a requested stop value for the sleep interval. That is, as described<br>
above for the sleep interval update algorithm, the sleep interval may be updated<br>
within a range from the initial-sleep window value to the final-sleep window<br>
value.<br>
The listening interval represents a requested listening interval, which may<br>
also be expressed by the number of frames.	<br>
(2) SLPRSP message<br>
The SLP-RSP message is a response message for the SLP-REQ message,<br>
which can used to indicate whether to approve or deny the mode transition to the<br>
sleep mode requested by the MS, or as an unsolicited instruction. The SLP-RSP<br>
message includes IEs required when the MS operates in the sleep mode. A format<br>
of the SLP-RSP message is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The SLP-RSP message is a dedicated message transmitted based on a<br>
basic CID of the MS.<br>
The Management message type IE represents the type of a message<br>
currently being transmitted. For example, when the Management message type<br><br>
has a value of 46, the transmitted message represents the SLP-RSP message.<br>
Further, the Sleep-approved has a value expressed by one bit. When the<br>
Sleep-approved has a value of 0, it implies that the request for the mode transition<br>
to the sleep mode has been denied (SLEEP-MODE REQUEST DENIED).<br>
However, when the Sleep-approved has a value of 1, it implies that the request for<br><br>
the mode transition to the sleep mode has been approved (SLEEP-MODE<br>
REQUEST APPROVED). Further, when the Sleep-approved has the value of 0, it<br>
implies that the BS has denied the mode transition to the sleep mode requested by<br>
the MS.	<br><br>
Accordingly, the MS having experienced the denial transmits the SLP-<br>
REQ message to the BS or waits for receiving an SLP-RSP message representing<br>
an unsolicited instruction from the BS when the situation requires. When the<br>
Sleep-approved has the value of 1, there exist the Start frame value, the initial-<br>
sleep window value, the final-sleep window value, the listening interval and the<br>
aforementioned SLPID. However, when the Sleep-approved has the value of 0,<br>
there exist the After-REQ-action value and the REQ-duration.<br>
The Start frame value represents the number of frames, not including the<br>
frame in which the SLP-RSP message has been received, until the MS enters the<br>
first sleep interval. That is, the MS transits to the sleep mode after the frames<br>
corresponding to the start frame value have passed from a frame directly after the<br>
frame in which the SLP-RSP message has been received.<br>
The SLPID is used for differentiating MSs staying in the sleep mode,<br>
which allows the total 1024 MSs staying in the sleep mode to be distinguished<br>
from one another.<br>
As described above, the initial-sleep window value represents a start<br>
value for the sleep interval, which is measured in frames the listening interval<br>
represents a value for a listening interval, and the final-sleep window value<br>
represents a stop value for the sleep interval. The After-REQ-action value<br>
represents an operation, which must be done by the MS having experienced the<br>
denial for the mode transition to the sleep mode.<br>
3) TRF-IND message	<br>
The TRF-IND message is a message transmitted from the BS to the MS<br>
during the listening interval, which represents the existence of packet data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS to the MS. The TRF-IND message has a format as shown<br>
in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
The TRF-IND message is a broadcasting message transmitted through the<br>
 broadcastirrg scheme, differently from the SLP-REQ message and the SLP-RSP<br>
message. The TRF-IND message represents if there is packet data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS to a predetermined MS. The MS decodes the broadcasted<br><br>
TRF-IND message during the listening interval and determines whether to transit<br>
to an awake mode or to return to the sleep mode again.<br>
When the MS transits to the awake mode, the MS confirms frame sync.<br>
When the frame sync does not coincide with a frame sequence number expected<br>
by the MS, the MS can request retransmission of packet data lost in the awake<br>
mode. When the MS has failed to receive the TRF-IND message during the<br>
listening interval or the TRF-IND message having received in the MS does not<br>
include a value representing a positive indication, the MS may return to the sleep<br>
mode.<br>
The Management message type IE is information representing the type of<br>
a message currently being transmitted. For example, when the Management<br>
message type has a value of 48, the transmitted message represents the TRF-IND<br>
message.<br>
The SLPID bit-map represents a set of indication indices. Each of the<br>
indication indices has one bit allocated to one of SLPIDs assigned to MSs in<br>
order to identify the MSs, respectively, which have transited to the sleep mode.<br>
That is, the SLPID bit-map represents a group of bits, each of which is allocated<br>
to an MS in the SLPID values (with a maximum value of'-1') assigned to the<br>
MSs currently staying in the sleep mode. The SLPID bit-map may be allocated a<br>
dummy bit for a byte alignment.<br>
A bit allocated to the MS represents if there is packet data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS to a corresponding MS. Further the MS in the sleep<br>
mode reads an SLPID and a mapped bit in the TRF-IND message received during<br>
the listening interval, which have been allocated in the mode transition to the<br>
sleep mode. If the allocated bit has a positive indication value, i.e., 1, the MS<br><br>
continuously maintains the awake mode. As a result, the MS transits to the awake<br>
i I<br>
mode. However, if the allocated bit has a negative indication value, i.e., 0, the MS<br>
transits to the sleep mode again.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram schematically illustrating a conventional ranging<br>
process in the IEEE 802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 3, the MS 300 is pewered on,monitors all frequency bands having been already set in the<br>
MS 300, and detects a reference signal, e.g., a pilot signal, having the highest<br>
Carrier-to-interference and Noise-Ratio (CINR). The MS 300 determines a BS<br>
320 having transmitted the pilot signal having the highest CINR as the BS 320 (or<br>
serving BS 320) to which the MS 300 currently belongs. The MS 300 receives the<br>
preamble of the downlink frame transmitted from the serving BS 320 and<br>
acquires system synchronization with the BS 320.<br>
As described above, when the system synchronization is acquired<br>
between the MS 300 and the serving BS 320, the serving BS 320 transmits a<br>
DownLink (DL)-MAP message and an Uplink (UL)-MAP message to the MS 300<br>
in steps 311 and 313. The DL-MAP message has a format as shown in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, the DL-MAP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the Management Message Type representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, the PHYsical (PHY) Synchronization set according to a modulation<br>
scheme and a demodulation scheme applied to a physical channel in order to<br>
acquire synchronization, the DCD count representing a count corresponding to<br>
the configuration variation of a Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) message<br>
 including a downlink bust profile, the Base Station ID represerrting a Base Station<br>
identifier, and the 'Number of DL-MAP Elements n' representing the number of<br>
elements existing after the Base Station ID. In particular, the DL-MAP message<br>
includes information for ranging codes allocated to each ranging in an OFDMA<br>
communication system. The MS 300 may detect information for downlink bursts<br>
included in the downlink frame through the DL-MAP message. Accordingly, the<br>
MS 300 may receive data, that is, data frames, in the burst by differentiating the<br>
downlink bursts of the downlink frame.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the UL-MAP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the Management Message Type representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, the Uplink Channel ID representing a used uplink channel identifier, the<br>
UCD count representing a count corresponding to the configuration variation of<br>
an Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD) message including an uplink bust profile,<br><br>
and the 'Number of UL-MAP Elements n' representing the number of elements<br>
existing after the UCD count. The uplink channel identifier lis uniquely allocated<br>
by a Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer.<br><br>
The MS 300 having synchronized with the BS 320, i.e., the MS 300<br>
having recognized downlink and uplink control information and actual data<br>
message to the BS 320 in step 315. The BS 320 having received the RNG-REQ<br>
message transmits a Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) message, which includes<br>
information for compensating for a frequency, a time and transmit power for the<br>
ranging, to the MS 300 in step 317.<br>
In FIG. 3, for convenience of description, the ranging process is ended<br>
through one-time RNG-REQ message transmission process and one-time RNG-<br>
RSP message transmission process corresponding to the RNG-REQ message<br>
transmission. However, according to the actual ranging process, the RNG-REQ<br>
message transmission process and the RNG-RSP message transmission process<br>
corresponding to the RNG-REQ message transmission may be repeated several<br>
times until the transmit power/timing/frequency compensation for the uplink is<br>
completed. The ranging process is periodically performed.<br><br>
As shown in Table 6, the RNG-REQ message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the Management Message Type representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, the Downlink Channel ID representing a downlink channel identifier<br>
included in the RNG-REQ message received in the MS 300 through the UCD<br>
message, and the Pending Until Complete representing a priority of a transmitted<br><br>
ranging response. The Pending Until Complete has a value of 8 bits. When the<br><br>
Pending Until Complete has a value of '00000000', the previous ranging response<br>
has a high priority. However, when the Pending Until Complete does not have the<br>
value of '00000000', the current ranging response has a high priority.<br><br>
As shown in Table 7, the RNG-RSP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the Management Message Type representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, and the Uplink Channel ID representing an uplink channel identifier<br>
included in the RNG-REQ message.<br>
The completion of the transmission/reception operations of the RNG-<br>
REQ message and the RNG-RSP message, i.e., the completion of the ranging<br>
process, may be determined by a Ranging Status parameter value of the TLV<br>
(Type, Length, Value) Encoded Information as shown in Table 7. The Ranging<br>
Status parameter has one of the values as shown in Table 8.<br><br>
The ranging process is performed through at least one-time exchange of<br>
the RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP message as described above. More<br>
specifically, the exchange of the RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP message<br>
may be repeated until the transmit power/timing/frequency compensation is<br>
completed. Further, the exchange of the RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP<br>
message of more than twice is controlled by the value of the Ranging Status in the<br><br>
RNG-RSP message transmitted from the BS.<br>
When the Ranging Status in the RNG-RSP message transmitted from the<br>
BS has a value of 1, the MS determines that it is necessary to additionally<br>
exchange the RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP message. More specifically,<br>
the MS determines that the ranging process continues, performs the transmit power/timing/frequency compensation with the BS, and then transmits the RNG<br>
REQ message to the BS. The BS having received the RNG-REQ message from<br>
the MS sets the Ranging Status of the RNG-RSP message to have a value of 1<br>
again when an additional compensation is required according to status of the<br>
transmit power/timing/frequency compensation by the MS.: The BS transmits the<br>
RNG-RSP message to the MS and enables an additional exchange the RNG-REQ<br>
message and the RNG-RSP message to be performed.<br>
However, when the additional compensation is not required according to<br>
the status of the transmit power/timing/frequency compensation by the MS, i.e.,<br>
the ranging process has succeeded, the BS sets the Ranging Status of the RNG-<br><br>
RSP message to have a value of 3 and prevents the RNG-REQ message and the<br>
RNG-RSP message from being additionally exchanged.<br>
Hereinafter, the ranging will be described in detail.<br>
The ranging may be classified into an initial ranging, a maintenance<br>
ranging, i.e., a periodic ranging, and a bandwidth request ranging. The MS may<br>
compensate for the transmit power through the ranging operation before<br>
transmitting data through an uplink, and may compensate for the timing offset<br>
and the frequency offset.<br>
First, the initial ranging will be described.<br>
The initial ranging is performed when a BS acquires synchronization with<br>
an MS, which represents a ranging performed in order to match the exact time<br>
offset between the MS and the BS and compensate for the transmit power. That is,<br>
the MS is powered on, receives a DL-MAP message and an UL-MAP message,<br>
and acquires synchronization with the BS. The MS performs the initial ranging to<br>
compensate for the time offset and the transmit power with the BS.<br>
Second, the periodic ranging will be described.<br><br>
The periodic ranging is performed when the MS having compensated for<br>
the time offset and the transmit power with the BS through the initial ranging<br>
compensates for channel conditions, etc., with the BS.<br>
Third, the bandwidth request ranging will be described.<br>
The bandwidth request ranging is performed when the MS having<br>
compensated for the time offset and the transmit power with the BS through the<br>
initial ranging requests a bandwidth allocation in order to actually perform<br>
communication with the BS.<br>
As described above, because the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
accommodates the mobility of the MS, the periodic ranging of the MS becomes a<br>
vital factor for data transmission/reception. According to the periodic ranging,<br>
which is an operation for measurement and compensation of parameters required<br>
when the MS performs reliable communication with the BS the BS must allocate<br><br>
uplink resources so that the MS can perform the periodic ranging, i.e., the MS can<br>
transmit an RNG-REQ message to the BS. More specifically, the BS must<br>
allocate the uplink resources to the MS for the periodic ranging of the MS and<br>
notifies information for allocation of the uplink resources of the MS through the<br><br>
UL-MAP message.<br>
Thereafter, the MS transmits the RNG-REQ message to the BS through<br>
the allocated uplink resources and performs the periodic ranging operation with<br>
the BS. The BS compensates for the transmit power, timing offset, and frequency<br>
offset according to the RNG-REQ message received from the MS and transmits<br>
the RNG-RSP message to the MS in response to the RNG-REQ message, thereby<br>
ending the periodic ranging.<br>
However, because the sleep mode operation and the ranging operation,<br>
particularly, the periodic ranging operation, have been proposed to operate<br>
independently from each other in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, the<br>
sleep mode operation and the periodic ranging operation do not have a correlation<br>
between themselves. That is, even an MS staying in the sleep mode must perform<br>
the periodic ranging in order to perform reliable communication with the BS.<br>
However, because the MS staying in the sleep mode cannot receive a message<br>
transmitted from the BS, it is impossible to receive resources for the periodic<br><br>
ranging. Accordingly, it is necessary to propose a scheme for the periodic<br>
ranging of the MS staying in the step mode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the<br>
following description, a detailed description of known functions and<br>
configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may obscure the<br>
subject matter of the present invention.	<br>
The present invention proposes a periodic ranging scheme for an Mobile<br>
Station(MS) that remains in a sleep mode of an Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 802.16e communication system, which is a<br>
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system. That is, the present<br>
invention allocates uplink sources for a periodic ranging, even to the MS staying<br>
in the sleep mode, thereby proposing a scheme that enables the MS to perform the<br><br>
periodic ranging in the sleep mode and perform reliable communication.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system is a BWA communication<br>
system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme<br>
and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access(OFDMA) scheme. In<br>
addition, the IEEE 802.16e communication system is a communication system capable of transmitting data at a high speed by transmitting physical channel—<br>
signals through multiple sub-carriers and accommodating the mobility of an MS<br>
by supporting a multi-cell structure. The present invention utilizes the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system as one example, but it is apparent to those who<br>
skilled in the art that the present invention can be applied to all communication<br>
systems supporting a sleep mode operation and a periodic ranging operation.<br>
Messages for supporting the periodic ranging operation in the sleep mode<br>
of the present invention will be descried herein below.<br>
(1) Sleep-Response (SLP-RSP) message<br>
As described in the prior art, the SLP-RSP message is a response message<br>
for an Sleep-Request(SLP-REQ) message. However, the present invention uses a<br>
new SLP-RSP message obtained by adding a predetermined field to an existing<br>
SLP-RSP message used in the IEEE 802.16e communication system. The SLP-<br>
RSP message proposed by the present invention has a format as shown in Table 9.<br><br><br><br>
The SLP-RSP message is a dedicated message transmitted based on a<br>
basic connection ID(CID) of the MS. The SLP-RSP message shown in table 9 has<br>
the same Information Elements(IEs) as those of the SLP-RSP message of table 2<br>
described in the prior art, i.e., those of the conventional SLP-RSP message used<br>
in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, except for the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging. Accordingly, the detained description for the same IEs will be omitted.<br>
The Next Periodic Ranging is an IE representing the frame number at<br>
which an MS must transit back to the awake mode, after transiting into the sleep<br>
mode from the awake mode, in order to perform the periodic ranging, i.e., in<br>
order to receive an uplink burst from the base station. More specifically, when the<br>
MS arrives at the frame number corresponding to the Next Periodic Ranging IE<br>
during a sleep interval, the MS must transit from the sleep mode to the awake<br>
mode in order to perform the periodic ranging.<br>
As described above, the Next Periodic Ranging IE informs the MS in the<br>
sleep mode of a point in time at which the MS is to transit to the awake mode.<br>
Accordingly, the Next Periodic Ranging IE may indicate the frame number at<br>
which the MS in the sleep mode must transit to the awake mode or the frame<br>
offset until the MS transits to the awake mode from the current point in time, i.e.,<br>
the current frame.<br>
When the Next Periodic Ranging IE indicates the frame number at which<br><br>
the MS staying in the sleep mode is to transit to the awake mode, the frame<br>
number is expressed by an absolute value. Further, when the Next Periodic<br><br>
Ranging IE indicates the frame offset until the MS staying in the sleep mode<br>
transits to the awake mode, it is noted that the frame offset is only a relative value<br>
of frame number. So, they have the same meaning.<br>
Accordingly, when the Next Periodic Ranging IE indicates the frame<br>
offset until the MS staying in the sleep mode transits to the awake mode, the MS<br>
adds a value indicated by the Next Periodic-Ranging IE to a frame number at<br><br>
which the SLP-RSP message has been received, thereby calculating the frame<br>
number at which the MS must transit to the awake mode. It is apparent that<br><br>
whether the Next Periodic Ranging IE indicates the frame number, i.e., absolute<br>
value, in which the MS is to transit to the awake mode or the frame offset, i.e.,<br>
relative value, up to a frame in which the MS is to transit to the awake mode may<br>
be adaptively determined according to a variety of circumstances in IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system.<br>
Further, the Next Periodic Ranging IE may be inserted into the SLP-RSP<br>
message as an essential IE as shown in table 9 or as an optional IE by means of a<br>
TLV (Type, Length, Value) encoding scheme, etc.	<br>
When the MS has already stayed in the awake mode, the MS only has to<br>
perform the periodic ranging in a frame having a frame number corresponding to<br>
the Next Periodic Ranging IE. When the MS still remains in the sleep mode, even<br>
after performing the periodic ranging, the MS may transit from the awake mode<br>
to the sleep mode again.<br>
(2) Ranging-Response(RNG-RSP) message<br>
As described in the prior art, the RNG-RSP message is a response<br>
message for an Ranging-Request(RNG-REQ) message. However, the present<br>
invention uses a new RNG-RSP message that is obtained by adding the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE as described in table 9 to a TLV Encoded Information field<br>
of an existing RNG-RSP message used in the IEEE 801.16e communication<br>
system. The RNG-RSP message of the present invention has the same IEs as<br>
those of the conventional RNG-RSP message used in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system as described in Table 7, except for the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging IE. Accordingly, the detailed description for the same IEs will be omitted.<br>
The Next Periodic Ranging IE added to the TLV Encoding parameter of the<br>
RNG-RSP message is shown in Table 10.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 10, because the Next Periodic Ranging IE is a TLV<br><br>
 Encoding type parameter, it is inserted into the RNG-RSP message and<br>
transmitted to the MS, only when the situation requires. That is, when the<br>
Ranging Status as described in table 8 of the prior art, from among the parameters<br>
of the RNG-RSP message, has been set to have a value of 3(success) in a point in<br>
time at which the periodic ranging is completed, a BS inserts the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging IE into the RNG-RSP message and transmits the RNG-RSP message to<br>
the MS. The MS having received the RNG-RSP message including the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE is aware of the completion of the periodic ranging operation,<br>
and detects the Next Periodic Ranging IE included in the RNG-RSP message in<br>
order to identify a frame in which the next periodic ranging starts.<br>
In table 10, the Next Periodic Ranging IE has indicated the frame number,<br>
i.e., absolute value, in which the MS is to transit to the awake mode. However,<br>
it is apparent that whether the Next Periodic Ranging IE indicates the frame offset,<br>
i.e., relative value, up to the frame in which the MS is to transit to the awake<br>
mode as described in table 9 may be adaptively determined according to a variety<br>
of circumstances in IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
When the MS stays in a sleep interval, after the periodic ranging<br>
operation has been completed, the MS may transit from the awake mode to the<br>
sleep mode again. Thereafter, the MS performs the periodic ranging according to<br>
the Next Periodic Ranging IE detected from the RNG-RSP message. When the<br>
MS stays in the sleep mode when the periodic ranging is performed, the MS<br>
transits to the awake mode and performs the periodic ranging operation. However,<br>
when the MS stays in the awake mode, the MS performs the periodic ranging<br>
operation in the awake mode.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram schematically illustrating a periodic ranging operation<br>
of an MS that remains in the sleep mode in the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4,<br>
the MS 450 transmits an SLP-REQ message to a BS 400 in order to transit from<br>
an awake mode to the sleep mode in step 401. Because the SLP-REQ message is<br><br>
the same as that described in Table 1 of the prior art, the detailed description will<br>
be omitted here.<br>
The BS 400 having received the SLP-REQ message from the MS 450<br>
determines whether to approve a mode transition to the sleep mode of the MS 450<br>
based on circumstances of the BS 400 and the MS 45,0. As a result of the<br>
determination,the BS 400 transmits an SLP-RSP message to the MS 450 in step <br>
403. The SLP-RSP message includes the IEs as described in Table 9, including<br>
the Next Periodic Ranging IE newly proposed by the present invention.<br>
When the MS 450 receives the SLP-RSP message from the BS 400, the<br>
MS 450 detects the Next Periodic Ranging IE included in the SLP-RSP message<br>
and prepares for the periodic ranging operation according to the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging IE.	<br>
As described in the prior art, the MS 450 performs a conventional sleep<br>
mode operation in the IEEE 802.16e communication system while increasing a<br>
sleep interval through a sleep interval update algorithm. When the MS 450 has<br>
arrived at a frame in which the periodic ranging must be performed in the sleep<br>
mode, i.e., when the MS 450 has arrived at a frame corresponding to the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE, the MS 450 staying in the sleep mode transits to an awake<br>
mode in step 405. The MS 450 must perform the periodic ranging operation in the<br>
awake mode in step 407.	<br>
The periodic ranging operation is performed through at least one-time<br>
exchange of the RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP message in steps 411, 413,<br>
415, 417, 419, 421, 423, and 425. When the MS 450 receives an uplink burst for a<br>
l<br>
periodic ranging corresponding to the Next Periodic Ranging IE from the BS 400<br>
in step 405, the MS 450 transmits the RNG-REQ message to the BS 400 through<br>
the received uplink burst in step 411. The BS 400 having received the RNG-REQ<br>
message transmits the RNG-RSP message including ranging response information<br>
to the MS 450 in step 413. The ranging response information includes<br>
information regarding the frequency, time, and transmit power, which must be<br>
compensated by the MS 450 through the RNG-REQ message. When it is<br>
necessary to additionally compensate for the frequency, time, and transmit power,<br>
the BS 400 sets the Ranging Status of the RNG-RSP message to have a value of 1,<br>
which indicates that the ranging process continues.<br><br>
The MS 450 having received the RNG-RSP message including the<br>
Ranging Status having the value of 1 detects parameters required for<br>
compensating for the frequency, time, and transmit power from the RNG-RSP<br>
message. The MS 450 compensates for the frequency, time, and transmit power.<br>
Further, the MS 450 transmits the RNG-REQ message to the BS 400 in order to<br>
continuously perform the unfinished compensation for the frequency, time, and<br>
The BS 400 having received the RNG-REQ message from the MS 450<br>
performs the periodic ranging operation while repeating the exchange of the<br>
RNG-REQ message and the RNG-RSP message as described above, in steps 417,<br>
419, 421, and 423. When the BS 400 determines that the compensation for the<br>
frequency, time, and transmit power by the MS 450 is not necessary any more, the<br>
BS 400 sets the Ranging Status of the RNG-RSP message, which corresponds to<br>
the RNG-REQ message received from the MS 450, to have a value of 3 to<br>
indicate that the ranging process has succeed. Further, the BS 400 adds the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE representing a frame in which the next periodic ranging must<br>
be performed to the RNG-RSP message, and transmits the RNG-RSP message to<br>
the MS 450 in step 425.<br>
The MS 450 having received the RNG-RSP message including the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE and the Ranging Status having the value of 3 identifies the<br>
completion of the periodic ranging, and prepares to perform a periodic ranging in<br>
the frame corresponding to the Next Periodic Ranging IE. When the MS 450<br>
remains in the sleep interval in a state in which the periodic ranging has been<br>
completed, the MS 450 may transit from the awake mode to the sleep mode.<br>
When the MS 450 remains in the sleep mode in the frame corresponding<br>
to the Next Periodic Ranging IE, the MS 450 transits from the sleep mode to the<br>
awake mode and performs the periodic ranging operation. However, when the MS<br>
450 stays in the awake mode, the MS 450 performs the periodic ranging operation<br>
in the awake mode.<br>
More specifically, when the MS 450 stays in the awake mode at a point in<br>
time at which the periodic ranging operation starts, the MS 450 must decode the<br>
DL-MAP message or the UL-MAP message as describediln Tables 4 or 5, in order<br>
to understand if a data burst for the MS 450 exists in a downlink frame. When the<br>
MS 450 understands that the BS 400 has allocated a Periodic Ranging<br><br>
Opportunity, i.e., an uplink burst, for the periodic ranging to the MS 450 in the<br>
course of decoding the DL-MAP message and the UL-MAP message, the MS 450<br>
recognizes the Periodic Ranging Opportunity allocated by the BS 400.<br>
When the MS 450 stays in the sleep mode at the point in time at which<br>
the periodic ranging operation starts, the MS 450 transits to the awake mode at<br>
the DL-MAP message or the UL-MAP message in order to recognize the Periodic<br>
Ranging Opportunity allocated by the BS 400.<br>
Accordingly, the Next Periodic Ranging IE proposed by the present<br>
invention is applied regardless of the sleep mode or the awake mode of the MS<br>
450, before the point in time at which the periodic ranging operation is performed<br>
or at the point in time at which the periodic ranging operation starts in step 427.<br>
That is, the periodic ranging operation in the sleep mode proposed by the present<br>
invention maintains compatibility with the general IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system as much as possible and can be taken into consideration together with the<br>
sleep mode.<br>
Further, the MS 450 must recalculate a frame in which the MS 450 is to<br><br>
transit to the awake mode according to the most recent Next Periodic Ranging IE<br>
received through the SLP-RSP message or the RNG-RSP message. For example,<br>
when the MS 450 transits to the sleep mode, after transiting to the awake mode<br>
during the operation in step 427, the MS 450 must recalculate a frame in which<br>
the MS 450 is to transit to the awake mode again, in order to perform the periodic<br>
ranging using the Next Periodic Ranging IE of the SLP-RSP message received in<br>
the MS 450.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a message exchange operation<br>
between an MS and a BS, based on the periodic ranging operation of the MS<br>
staying in the sleep mode in the IEEE 802.16e communication system according<br>
to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, when the MS 500 staying in the awake mode<br>
attempts to transit to the sleep mode, the MS 500 transmits the SLP-REQ<br>
message to the BS 550 in step 511. The BS 550 having received the SLP-REQ<br>
message determines whether to approve a mode transition to the sleep mode of<br>
the MS 500, based on the circumstances of the BS 550 and the MS 500. As a<br><br>
result of the determination, the BS 550 transmits the SLP-RSP message the MS<br>
500 in step 513. The SLP-RSP message includes the IEs as described in Table 9,<br>
particularly, the Next Periodic Ranging IE. The MS 500 having received the SLP-<br>
RSP message from the BS 550 starts a sleep mode operation according to the<br>
SLP-RSP message in step 515. Further, the MS 500 detects a point in time at<br>
which the periodic ranging operation is to be performed from the Next Periodic<br>
When the MS 500 arrives at a frame corresponding to the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging IE while the MS 500 operates in the sleep mode, the MS 500 transits<br>
from the sleep mode to an awake mode in order to perform the periodic ranging<br>
operation with the BS 550 in step 517. Further, the MS 500 identifies the Periodic<br>
Ranging Opportunity, i.e., an uplink burst, which has been allocated to the MS<br>
500, through an UL-MAP message broadcasted from the BS 550 in step 523. The<br>
MS 500 transmits an RNG-REQ message to the BS 550 through the uplink burst<br>
detected from the UL-MAP message in step 525.	<br>
The BS 550, having received the RNG-REQ message from the MS 500,<br>
transmits an RNG-RSP message including information, which is required for<br>
compensating for a frequency, a time, and transmit power by the MS 500, to the<br>
MS 500 in response to the RNG-REQ message in step 527. When the BS 550<br>
determines that it is necessary to additionally compensate for the frequency, time,<br>
and transmit power by the MS 500, the BS 550 sets the Ranging Status of the<br>
RNG-RSP message to have a value of 1 (continue) and transmits the RNG-RSP<br>
message to the MS 500.<br>
After receiving the RNG-RSP message including the Ranging Status<br>
having the value of 1, the MS 500 determines that the periodic ranging has not<br>
ended, i.e., is in progress, and transmits the RNG-REQ message to the BS 550 in<br>
step 529. Because the exchange operations in steps 531 and 533 of the RNG-REQ<br>
message and the RNG-RSP message after step 529 are the same as steps 525 and<br>
527, the detailed description will be omitted here.<br>
When the BS 550 determines that it is not necessary to compensate for<br>
the frequency, time, and transmit power by the MS500, during the periodic<br>
ranging operation, through the exchange of the RNG-REQ message and the<br>
RNG-RSP message as described above, i.e., when the BS 550 determines that it is<br>
necessary to end the periodic ranging operation, the BS 550 transmits the RNG-<br><br>
RSP message to the MS 500 in step 535, which includes the Next Periodic<br>
Ranging IE and the Ranging Status having a value of 3 (success).<br>
The MS 500 understands the ending of the periodic ranging operation by<br>
receiving the RNG-RSP message including the Next Periodic Ranging IE and the<br>
Ranging Status having the value of 3. When the MS 500 stays in a sleep interval<br>
519, even-after-thc periodic ranging operation has been completed,the MS 500<br>
transits from the awake mode to the sleep mode again in step 537.<br>
When the MS 500 arrives at a frame calculated corresponding to the Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE received through the RNG-RSP message, the MS 500<br>
transits from the sleep mode to the awake mode again in step 537. Herein, when<br>
the MS 500 stays in the awake mode instead of the sleep mode, the MS 500<br>
performs the periodic ranging operation in the frame calculated corresponding to<br>
the Next Periodic Ranging IE. Because operations after steps 539 and 541 in FIG.<br><br>
5 are the same as the periodic ranging operation as described above, the detailed<br>
description will be omitted here.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating an operation process of an MS<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the MS<br>
operating in a sleep mode in step 611 determines if a sleep interval has ended in<br>
step 613. When the sleep interval has ended, the MS determines if the current is<br>
a listening interval in step 615.	<br>
When the current interval is not the listening, interval, step 623 is<br>
performed. However, when the current interval is the listening interval, in step<br>
617, the MS determines if a traffic indication (TRF-IND) message has been<br>
received from a BS. When the TRF-IND message has not been received from the<br>
BS, the MS returns to step 615.<br>
When the TRF-IND message has been received from the BS, the MS<br>
determines if a bit representing the MS has been included in an SLPID bitmap of<br>
the TRF-IND message received from the BS in step 619. When the bit<br>
representing the MS has not been included in the SLPID bitmap, step 623 is<br>
performed.<br>
When the bit representing the MS has been included in the SLPID bitmap,<br>
the MS determines if the bit representing the MS has a value implying a positive<br>
indication, i.e., 1, in step 621. When the bit representing the MSS does not have<br><br>
the value of 1, i.e., the bit representing the MS has a value implying a negative<br>
indication, e.g., 0, step 623 is performed.<br>
In step 623, the MS transits to the sleep mode again and then the<br>
procedure ends. However, when the bit representing the MS has the value of 1,<br>
step 625 is performed. Because the bit representing the MS has the value of 1<br>
awake mode in step 625. Thereafter, the procedure ends.	<br>
As a result of the determination in step 613, when the sleep interval has<br>
not ended, the MS determines if the current frame number is identical to a frame<br>
number corresponding to a Next Periodic Ranging IE received through the SLP-<br>
RSP message in step 627. When the current frame number is not identical to the<br>
frame number corresponding to the Next Periodic Ranging IE, the procedure<br>
returns to step 613. However, when the current frame number is identical to the<br>
frame number corresponding to the Next Periodic Rarging IE, step 629 is<br>
performed.<br>
As described in Tables 9 and 10, the Next Periodic Ranging IE may<br>
indicate the frame offset up to a Periodic Ranging Opportunity from a reception<br>
of the SLP-RSP message or the RNG-RSP message including the Ranging Status<br>
having the value of 3. In this case, the MS adds the Next Periodic Ranging IE<br>
value to a frame number at which the SLP-RSP message or the RNG-RSP<br>
message has been received, and calculates and understands a frame number at<br><br>
which the MS is to transit to the awake mode. Accordingly, when the current<br>
frame number is identical to that calculated/understood by the MS, step 629 is<br>
performed. However, when the current frame number is not identical to that<br>
calculated/understood by the MS, the procedure returns to; step 613.<br>
In step 629, because the MS has arrived at the frame corresponding to the<br>
Next Periodic Ranging IE, the MS performs a periodic ranging operation. The<br>
periodic ranging operation represents an operation for compensating for the<br>
frequency, time, and transmit power while repeating transmission of the RNG-<br>
REQ message to the BS and reception of the RNG-RSP message for the RNG-<br>
REQ message from the BS as described above.<br>
In step 631, the MS determines if the periodic ranging operation has<br>
been completed. Herein, the MS can determine if the periodic ranging operation<br>
has been completed by confirming if the Ranging Status of the RNG-RSP<br><br>
message received from the BS has a value of 3. When the periodic ranging<br>
operation has not been completed, the procedure returns to step 629.<br>
When the periodic ranging operation has been completed, the MS detects<br>
i<br>
and stores a Next Periodic Ranging IE included in an RNG-RSP message finally<br>
received from the BS in step 633.<br>
In step 635, the MS determines if the MS stays in a sleep interval after<br>
the periodic ranging operation. When the MS does not stay in the sleep interval,<br>
step 625 is performed. However, when the MS stays in the sleep interval, in step<br>
623, the MS transits from the awake mode to the sleep mode. Thereafter, the<br>
procedure ends.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a sleep response operation process of<br>
a BS for a sleep request of an MS according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 7, in step 711, the BS determines if an SLP-REQ<br>
message is received from the MS. When the SLP-REQ message is received from<br>
the MS, n step 713, the BS having received the SLP-REQ message from the MS<br>
determines whether to approve the sleep request of the MS, i.e., whether to<br>
approve a mode transition to a sleep mode of the MS, according to the<br>
circumstances of the BS and the MS. When the BS approves the sleep request of<br>
the MS, step 715 is performed.<br>
In step 715, the BS sets a SLEEP-APPROVED to have a value of 1,<br>
which represents an approval for the sleep request of the MS, in an SLP-RSP<br>
message, which is a response message for the SLP-REQ message, and sets a Next<br>
Periodic Ranging IE.<br>
In step 719, the BS transmits the SLP-RSP message to the MS. Thereafter,<br>
the procedure ends.<br>
However, when the BS does not approve the sleep request of the MS, in<br>
step 717, the BS sets the SLEEP-APPROVED to have a value of 0, and sets an<br>
AFTER-REQ-Action value and a REQ-Duration.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating a periodic ranging operation process<br>
of a BS with an MS according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in step 811, the BS determines if the BS has arrived at a<br><br>
periodic ranging period. When the BS has arrived at the periodic ranging period,<br>
in step 813, the BS performs the periodic ranging operation with the<br>
corresponding MS, i.e., the BS performs exchange operations of an RNG-REQ<br>
message and an RNG-RSP message with the corresponding MS.<br>
In step 815, the BS determines if the BS has arrived at a point in time at<br>
compensate for the frequency, time, and transmit power any more by the MS.<br>
When the BS has not arrived at the point in time at which the periodic ranging<br>
operation is to be completed, the procedure returns to step 813.<br>
When the BS has arrived at the point in time at which theperiodic ranging<br>
operation is to be completed, in step 817, the BS transmits the RNG-RSP message<br>
including a Next Periodic Ranging IE to the MS. Herein, the Ranging Status of<br>
the RNG-RSP message for completing the periodic ranging operation is set to<br>
have a value of 3 as described above.	<br>
In step 819, the BS ends the periodic ranging operation with the MS, and<br>
then ends the procedure.<br>
As described above, the present invention supports a sleep mode<br>
operation and an awake mode operation, and also a periodic ranging operation in<br>
a BWA communication system using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme, i.e., an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. More specifically, the present invention supports<br>
a periodic ranging operation of an MSS operating in a sleep mode in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system, thereby ensuring backward compatibility and<br>
providing reliable communication with minimum power consumption.<br>
Consequently, the present invention can improve a Quality of Service(QoS).<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br><br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
