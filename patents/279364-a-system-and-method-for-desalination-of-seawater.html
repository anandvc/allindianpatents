				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to desalination systems and methods, in particular a<br>
method using multi-effect evaporators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Distillation of water, being a commonly used method of desalination, is a<br>
process in which various soluble materials such as salt, contaminants etc. are eliminated<br>
from water containing these materials, leaving clean, usually drinkable water. One<br>
known method for achieving such distillation relies on water evaporation, much like salt<br>
and scale being accumulated on the bottom of an electric kettle after water has<br>
evaporated. In this process during evaporation of the water, soluble materials that are<br>
not volatile remain in a solid state residue, usually in the form of salt and scale, and are<br>
disposed of. The vapor can then be condensed back into the state of liquid, resulting in<br>
contaminant free water.<br>
One of the problems in the above process is scale formation on the surfaces of<br>
the evaporation equipment, caused by compounds of the seawater such as, for example,<br>
calcium carbonate and sulfate. These and other scale formation compounds are usually<br>
removed from the seawater by means of different pre-treatment processes.<br>
Also, disposal of the residual brine, i.e. concentrated solution of salts remaining<br>
after the distillation process, may cause an ecological problem. Moreover, the disposal<br>
of brines presents significant costs and challenges for the desalination industry, which<br>
increase the time required for permits and construction of new plants and result in<br>
higher cost of water treated thereby.<br>
One way to deal with brines from seawater desalination is making use of zero<br>
liquid discharge (ZLD) systems. A ZLD system evaporates brine leaving a salt residue<br>
for disposal or reuse.<br>
<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order to understand the invention and to see how it may be carried out in<br>
practice, embodiments will now be described, by way of non-limiting examples only,<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically illustrates one example of a system according to the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 schematically illustrates another example of a system according to die<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRD7TION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 schematically show two examples of a system for seawater<br>
desalination according to the present invention, designated as 10 and 30, respectively.<br>
The system 10 comprises a pre-treatment sub-system 11, a multi-effect<br>
evaporator 13 with its associated feed heater 21, a concentrator 17 (not shown)<br>
combined with a crystallizer 19 (not shown) in one common multi-effect<br>
concentrator/crystallizer installation 15, which has a succession of corresponding<br>
primarily concentrating (PC) effects and primarily crystallizing (PCR) effects. The<br>
concentrator 17 and the crystallizer 19 may further be two distinct separate installations.<br>
Similarly, the system 30 comprises a pre-treatment sub-system 31, a multi-<br>
effect evaporator 33 with its associated feed heater 41, the evaporator 33 (not shown)<br>
incorporating a concentrator 37 (not shown) in one common multi-effect installation 35,<br>
having a succession of corresponding primarily desalinating (PD) effects and primarily<br>
concentrating (PC) effects, and a crystallizer 39.<br>
Each of the systems 10 and 30 further comprises three condensers 12, 14 and<br>
16. The condenser 12 is a falling film condenser and the condensers 14 and 16 are<br>
forced circulation condensers. The construction of the condensers 12, 14 and 16 is<br>
known per se.<br>
The systems 10 and 30 further comprise a steam supply system 50 (not shown)<br>
for supplying vapor to the systems, as will be explained below.<br>
Witii reference to Fig. 1, in operation of the system 10, seawater W first enters<br>
the pre-treatment sub-system 11 where predetermined scale forming components, such<br>
as carbonate, are removed therefrom and it is fed as feed water WF, via the condenser<br>
12 and the feed heater 21, to the multi-effect evaporator 13, where main desalination<br>
process takes place and three main products are produced: main desalted water WM (not<br>
shown) which constitutes a majority of total water product Wtotal outcoming from the<br>
multi-effect evaporator 13, main brine BM proceeding to further treatment in the<br>
desalination system, and a first condensate return R1 flowing back to the steam supply<br>
system 50 and then is supplied as a vapor V1 to the multi-effect evaporator 13.<br>
The condensers 12 and 14 produce additional desalted water WA12 and WA14,<br>
which is produced from a vapor V1' and withdrawn as a part of the total water product<br>
Wtotal- The vapor V1' satisfies V1'=V1+D, in which D refers to energy losses in the<br>
system.<br>
Further treatment of the main brine Bm is performed in the multi-effect<br>
concentrator/crystallizer installation 15, in which concentration process, and subsequent<br>
crystallization process, take place in the corresponding PC and PCR effects of the<br>
concentrator/crystallizer installation 15, resulting in the production of:<br>
(i) salts generally designated S, and a bitterns solution BS which are men<br>
withdrawn from the system as products having a potential of being used in<br>
the desalination plant or outside thereof;<br>
(ii) additional desalted water Wa1 and Wa2, which is then fed to the multi-effect<br>
evaporator 13 together with an additional desalted water WAi6 coming from<br>
the condenser 16. Wai, Wa2 and WA16 constitute together additional desalted<br>
water WA, which is brought in the evaporator 13 to the same temperature as<br>
the main water product Wm, and from where it is then withdrawn as a part of<br>
the total water product Wtotal so that Wtotal= Wm +WA+WA12+WA14; and<br>
(iii) second condensate return R2 flowing to the steam supply system 50 and then<br>
is supplied as a vapor V2 to the concentrator/crystallizer installation 15.<br>
The additional desalted water W16 discharged from the condenser 16 is produced<br>
from a vapor V2', which satisfies V2'=V2+D, in which D refers to energy losses in the<br>
system.<br>
WA1, which is a majority of the additional desalted water WA is obtained as a<br>
result of the concentration process which takes place in the concentrator 17 [or PC<br>
effects 17 of the of the multi-effect concentrator/crystallizer installation 15], during<br>
which a brine Bc (not shown) more concentrated than the main brine Bm is produced.<br>
<br>
The brine Bc is then used in the crystallization process, resulting in the production of<br>
the salts S, the bitterns solution BS and some more additional desalted water WA2.<br>
To operate as described above, the multi-effect evaporator 13 has evaporator<br>
inlets 13a to 13c. The inlet 13a is adapted for receiving therein the feed water Wf, the<br>
second inlet 13b is adapted for receiving therein the vapor V1 for use in the desalination<br>
process, and the third inlet 13c is adapted for receiving therein the additional desalted<br>
water Wa coming from the multi-effect concentrator/crystallizer installation 15. The<br>
evaporator 13 further comprises four evaporator outlets, namely, the outlet 13d for<br>
discharging therefrom the main product Wtotal, the outlet 13e for discharging<br>
therefrom the main brine Bm, the outlet 13f for discharging therefrom the first<br>
condensate return R1 and the outlet 13g for discharging therefrom vapor V1' to the<br>
condensers 12 and 14.<br>
The concentrator/crystallizer installation 15 has two inlets, 15a and 15b, for<br>
receiving therein the main brine Bm and the vapor V2, respectively. It further has five<br>
outlets 15c to 15g, for discharging therefrom vapor V2' that goes to the condenser 16,<br>
the additional desalted water Wa, the bitterns solution BS, salts S and the second<br>
condensate return R2, respectively. The outlet 15f refers to a group of outlets for<br>
discharging therefrom of different kinds of salts.<br>
In one specific example of the system 10, salts S produced as a result of the<br>
crystallization process in the multi-effect concentrator/crystallizer installation 15 from<br>
the brine product Bc are industrial salt NaCl and calcium sulfate CaSO4.<br>
In such system 10, the pre-treatment sub-system 11 is adapted to remove from<br>
the seawater W mostly sulfate ions SO42-. For this purpose, the pre-treatment system 11<br>
may comprise de-carbonization columns 18, where acid is added to the seawater feed W<br>
and most of the sulfate ions SO42- are removed. The sulfate ions may be substituted with<br>
anions such as chloride Cl-. Alternatively, the sulfate may be regenerated with a salt,<br>
such as Potash KC1 or common salt NaCl. In this case, the solution of the respective<br>
sulfate will be created, from which a saleable commodity may be recovered by means<br>
known per se. During the pre-treatment process the alkalinity is further removed from<br>
the seawater feed together with the sulfate.<br>
One particular example of the multi-effect evaporator 13 that may be used in the<br>
system 10 is of so-called 'forward feed flow' type, in which the feed water and the vapor<br>
both move downstream during the process. The evaporator may for example be of the<br>
<br>
kind described in detail in PCT/IL2006/000302, which in its entirety is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. This evaporator 13 in the described example is adapted to desalt the<br>
water flowing therethrough so that the main brine BM released from the evaporator 13<br>
has a salt concentration of approximately 10%. The evaporator according to the present<br>
invention may comprise tubes as described in the above publication or fluted oval tubes.<br>
The concentrator 17 [or PC effects 17 of the multi-effect<br>
concentrator/crystallizer installation 15] used in the system 10 may be of any<br>
appropriate type known in the art, capable to concentrate the main brine Bm of the<br>
above salt concentration, to the extent that the brine product Bc released therefrom has a<br>
salt concentration of approximately 20%-22%, allowing it to be further used in the<br>
production of salt products, in particular those indicated above, in the crystallizer 19.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, in the operation of the desalination system 30,<br>
seawater W first enters the pre-treatment sub-system 31 where predetermined scale<br>
forming components are removed therefrom, and is fed as feed water Wf, via the<br>
condenser 12 and the feed heater 41, to the combined multi-effect<br>
evaporator/concentrator installation 35. In this installation 35, the following processes<br>
take place:<br>
the feed water Wf undergoes a desalination process in the PD effects 33, which<br>
results in the production of main desalted water Wm constituting a majority of total<br>
water product WTOtal outcoming from the multi-effect installation 35, and of main<br>
brine Bm (not shown); and<br>
the main brine Bm undergoes concentration in the PC effects 37 of the multi-<br>
effect installation 35, to produce brine Bc and additional desalted water WA1, which is<br>
then withdrawn as a part of the total water product Wtotal.<br>
The condensers 12 and 14 produce additional desalted water Wa12 and Wa14,<br>
which is withdrawn as a part of the total water product Wtotal.<br>
The evaporator/concentrator installation 35 further produces a first condensate<br>
return R1 which flows back to the steam supply system 50 and then is supplied as a<br>
vapor V1 to thereto.<br>
The brine Bc from the multi-effect installation 35 flows to the crystallizer 39, in<br>
which a crystallization process takes place, resulting in the production of:<br>
<br>
(i) salt S and bitterns solution BS, which are then withdrawn from the system<br>
as products having a potential of being used in the desalination plant or<br>
outside thereof;<br>
(ii) additional desalted water Wa2, which is then fed to the multi-effect<br>
installation 35, constituting together with an additional water WA16 from the<br>
condenser 16 an additional water WA, so that Wa=Wa2+WA16, where it is<br>
brought to the same temperature as the main water product Wm, and from<br>
where it is then withdrawn as a part of the total water product WTOtal so that<br>
Wtotal= Wm + WA1 + WA12+WA14+ WA'; and<br>
(iii) second condensate return R2 flowing to the steam supply system 50 similarly<br>
to be then supplied to the crystallizer 39 as a vapor V2.<br>
To operate as described above, the multi-effect installation 35 has multi-effect<br>
installation inlets 35a to 35c. The inlet 35a is adapted for receiving therein the feed<br>
water Wf, the second inlet 35b is adapted for receiving therein the vapor V1 for use in<br>
the desalination process, and the third inlet 35c is adapted for receiving therein the<br>
additional desalted water WA' coming from the crystallizer 39. The installation 35<br>
further comprises four multi-effect installation outlets, namely, the outlet 35d for<br>
discharging therefrom the main product Wtotal, the outlet 35e for discharging<br>
therefrom the brine product Bc, the outlet 35f for discharging therefrom the first<br>
condensate return R1 and the outlet 35g for discharging therefrom vapor Vc that goes to<br>
the condensers 12 and 14.<br>
The crystallizer 39 has two crystallizer inlets, 39a and 39b, for receiving therein<br>
the brine product Bc and the vapor V2, respectively. It further has five crystallizer<br>
outlets 39c to 39g, for discharging therefrom vapor Vc that goes to the condenser 16,<br>
the additional desalted water Wa2, the bitterns solution BS, salts S and the second<br>
condensate return R2, respectively. The outlet 39f refers a group of outlets for<br>
discharging therefrom of different kinds of salts, is desired.<br>
In one particular example of the system 30, the salt S produced by the<br>
crystallizer 39 is industrial salt NaCl.<br>
The pre-treatment sub-system 31 in such system 30 is adapted to remove<br>
substantially all calcium ions from the seawater W. For this purpose, the pre-treatment<br>
system 31 may comprise a reactor 43 and a clarifier 44. During the pre-treatment<br>
process calcium ions from the seawater W react with soda ash Na2CO3 in the reactor 43<br>
and hardly-soluble calcium carbonate CaCO3 is created and then precipitates and<br>
removed from the seawater W in the clarifier 44. Optionally, a soluble base, such as<br>
caustic soda NaOH, in an amount substantially equivalent to the content of bicarbonate<br>
ion HCO3- in the seawater W, may be added thereto, thereby saving about one fourth of<br>
the required amount of soda ash. During the above process sulfates is removed together<br>
with calcium carbonate.<br>
The multi-effect evaporator/concentrator installation 35 may have a<br>
configuration similar to that of the multi-effect evaporator 13, with a difference being<br>
mainly in that its PD effects 33 (not shown) are followed by the PC effects 37 (not<br>
shown). In the present example, the brine BM produced by the PD effects 33 may have<br>
salt concentration of approximately 10%, and the brine Bc which produced therefrom<br>
by the PC effects 37 may have salt concentration of approximately 20%-22%.<br>
An additional difference between the PD and PC effects in the installation 35<br>
may be in that at least a part of the pipes and tubes in the PC effects 37 may be made of<br>
material different from the material of the pipes and tubes in the PD effects, to better<br>
withstand increased salt concentration of the brine passing therethrough.<br>
The pre-treatment processes of sub-systems 11 and 31 of the systems 10 and 30<br>
in the examples described above prevent scale and corrosion of the equipment used in<br>
the systems 10 and 30. Removing both calcium carbonate and sulfate in the sub-system<br>
31, in addition, allows the multi-effect evaporator 33 to run smoothly even though brine<br>
having a high salt concentration flows therein.<br>
Table 1 summarizes, in a non-limiting manner, parameters which the systems 10<br>
and 30 may have, in accordance with the examples described above with reference to<br>
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
Table 1<br>
<br>
As summarized in Table 1, there are differences between consumptions of the<br>
cooling water supplied to the condensers 14 and 16 and the steam supplied to different<br>
parts of the two systems 10 and 30. In particular, in the system 10 the steam<br>
consumption is 76,560 kg/hr and cooling water consumption is 4,482,000 kg/hr. In the<br>
system 30 the steam consumption is 61,100 kg/hr and cooling water consumption is<br>
2,222,000 kg/hr. The main reason for this difference is the configurations of the multi-<br>
effect evaporators 13 and 33. The evaporator 33 consumes less steam. Consequently,<br>
less cooling water is required.<br>
Based on the above Table 1, water and brine rates may be approximately<br>
calculated for the systems 10 and 30.<br>
System 10<br>
Main desalted water discharged from the evaporator 13 is calculated as follows:<br>
Additional desalted water discharged from the concentrator and the crystallizer:<br>
<br>
System 30<br>
Main desalted water Wm and additional desalted water WA1 discharged from the multi-<br>
effect installation 35 is calculated as follows:<br>
<br>
Desalted water discharged from the crystallizer is calculated as follows:<br>
<br>
Total water recovery is calculated as follows:<br>
<br>
As shown above, both systems 10 and 30 are adapted for recovering of almost<br>
95% of the water content of the feed seawater W. It can be further roughly estimated<br>
from the above calculations, that water recovery is divided between different parts of<br>
the system as follows: evaporator/PD effects - about 65% (66.6%) of the total recovery,<br>
crystallizer/PCR effects - about 15% (11.3%) of the total recovery, and concentrator/PC<br>
effects - about 15% of the total recovery (95-65-11.3 = 18.7%).<br>
The remaining 5% are salts and bitterns solution, whose contents are determined<br>
by the kind of the pre-treatment that is applied to the feed water W.<br>
Those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains will readily appreciate<br>
that numerous changes, variations, and modification can be made without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention, mutatis mutandis.<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A system for desalination of seawater W having an original water salinity and a<br>
original water concentration of scale forming components, the system comprising:<br>
