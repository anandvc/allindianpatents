FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates generally to Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies, and<br>
more particularly, to a versatile system for emergency rate reduction (SOS) in a DSL system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies utilize existing telephone subscriber lines to<br>
provide high bandwidth digital communications to end users. Diagram 100 of FIG. 1 provides<br>
an illustration of general system. Certain varieties of DSL technology - in particular,<br>
asymmetric DSL (ADSL) or Very high rate DSL (VDSL) - are capable of adapting transmission<br>
parameters based on channel conditions and end-user demands. ADSL or VDSL technologies<br>
utilize a discrete multitone (DMT) line code - one that assigns a number of bits to each tone (or<br>
sub-carrier), individually. DMT code may then be adjusted to channel conditions; by<br>
determining the number of bits assigned to each tone during training and initialization of<br>
modems at each end of a subscriber line.<br>
VDSL2 (ITU-T G.993.2) is an advanced DSL technology that is usually deployed in shorter<br>
loops, and uses wider frequency bandwidth when compared with ADSL. Correspondingly,<br>
VDSL2 generates a greater degree of crosstalk interference in a line's cable bundle. VDSL2<br>
transceivers on adjacent lines may be seriously affected - especially by far-end crosstalk<br>
(FEXT), since such FEXT emanates within those receivers' frequency bands. This is illustrated<br>
in reference to diagram 200 of FIG. 2. When an adjacent pair of transceivers starts initialization,<br><br>
an initial pair already in operation suffers from a suddenly increased crosstalk level. VDSL2<br>
crosstalk occurs in a wideband environment. As such, crosstalk is higher at higher frequencies;<br>
and crosstalk in VDSL2 is often worse than that in, for example, ADSL. Correspondingly,<br>
increments of interference may be much greater than noise margins - causing unacceptable noise<br>
margins and bursts of CRC errors that force modems to retrain, which leads to disruptions of<br>
service. Such issues are commonly identified in laboratory test and field trials.<br>
In a conventional system, data signals transmitted over twisted-pair phone lines may be<br>
significantly degraded by crosstalk interference that is generated on one or more adjacent<br>
twisted-pair phone lines in the same (or an adjacent) cable bundle. Correspondingly, suddenly<br>
increased crosstalk or other interferences - arising from using twisted-pair phone lines for high<br>
data transmission rate technologies (i.e., ADSL or VDSL) - may substantially inhibit proper<br>
transmission of data signals.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to provide a system that effectively and efficiently removes or<br>
reduces crosstalk interference effects in the operation of high data transmission rate technologies,<br>
on an immediate and real-time basis.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a system, including various methods and apparatus, for<br>
mitigating the effects crosstalk noise - especially sudden increases in such noise - due to, for<br>
example, initialization of VDSL2 modems in adjacent pairs. The present invention introduces an<br>
emergency rate adjustment system (SOS) that provides for immediate and real-time adjustment<br>
of operational data rates to mitigate crosstalk noise. The SOS provides simple request and<br>
response - or synchronous message or signal - mechanisms, over which few, if any, parameters<br>
are exchanged.<br>
When crosstalk noise in a DSL system increases suddenly, a burst of CRC errors may occur<br>
in a receiver within the DSL system - causing the DSL modems to reset or retrain. The SOS of<br>
the present invention maintains modem connections without a reset/retrain, and thus avoids<br>
interruption of end-user services. A receiver initiates an SOS operation request to a transmitter<br>
at the other end and, upon receiving this request, the transmitter initiates a switch to a known<br><br>
adjustment transmission reference. For example, the receiver may initiate a switch to a pre-<br>
determined bit/gain table. The transmitter sends a synchronous signal to synchronize switching<br>
between the transmitter and the receiver. In other embodiments, a new adjustment bit/gain table<br>
may be produced during initialization, and stored in both transmitter and receiver - thus<br>
requiring no exchange of a bit/gain table during SOS. The new adjustment transmission<br>
reference (e.g., bit/gain table) provides information necessary to adjust transmission performance<br>
to a level that ensures a stable communication link (e.g., VDSL2 link); providing enough margin<br>
to successfully operate even in worst-case crosstalk noise. The SOS minimizes or eliminates<br>
crosstalk-related CRC errors to such an extent that the transmission link may be maintained, at<br>
an adjusted lower - even if sub-optimal - data rate.<br>
The system of the present invention provides processes and constructs for producing an SOS<br>
adjustment transmission reference (e.g., bit/gain table). The system of the present invention<br>
comprehends and may accommodate various system requirements - such as minimum data rate.<br>
The system of the present invention does all of this in a simple and elegant manner; requiring<br>
minimal - or even no - data exchange during SOS operation. The present invention provides<br>
reliable communication for SOS information; as well as measures to maintain certain<br>
performance parameters (e.g., delay, INP) at approximately equal levels before and after SOS.<br>
The present invention thus provides a system for realizing emergency rate reduction (SOS).<br>
A receiver initiates a rate reduction request, and communicates the request to a transmitter at the<br>
other end. The transmitter initiates an operational switch to an adjustment transmission reference<br>
(i.e., a new bit/gain table), and sends a synchronous signal to synchronize the operation switch<br>
for both the transmitter and the receiver. The adjustment transmission reference may be<br>
calculated using a formula - predefined or determined in real time - from a current bit/gain table,<br>
or may be a predefined bit/gain table.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use<br>
the invention. The general principles described herein may be applied to embodiments and<br>
applications other than those detailed below without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention as defined herein. The present invention is not intended to be limited to the<br>
embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and<br>
features disclosed herein.<br>
The present invention provides a system for mitigating the effects of sudden noise increase -<br>
especially sudden increases in crosstalk noise - due to, for example, initialization of VDSL2<br>
modems in adjacent pairs. The present invention introduces an emergency rate adjustment<br>
(SOS) system that provides simple request and response - or synchronous message or signal -<br>
mechanisms, over which few, if any, parameters are exchanged.<br>
When crosstalk noise in a DSL system increases suddenly, a burst of CRC errors may occur<br>
in a receiver - causing modems to reset or retrain. The SOS of the present invention maintains<br>
modem connections without a reset/retrain, and thus avoids interruption of end-user services. A<br>
receiver initiates an SOS operation request to a transmitter at the other end and, upon receiving<br>
this request, the transmitter initiates a switch to a known adjustment transmission reference. For<br>
example, the transmitter may initiate a switch to a pre-determined bit/gain table. The transmitter<br><br>
sends a synchronous signal to synchronize switching between the transmitter and the receiver. In<br>
other embodiments, a new adjustment bit/gain table may be produced during initialization, and<br>
stored in both transmitter and receiver - thus requiring no exchange of a bit/gain table during<br>
SOS. In yet another embodiment, an appropriate coarse adjustment of the bit/gain table may be<br>
determined by the receiver in the real time, and communicated to the remote transmitter with a<br>
short reliable message. A new adjustment transmission reference (e.g., bit/gain table) provides<br>
information necessary to adjust transmission performance to a level that ensures a stable<br>
communication link (e.g., VDSL2 link); providing enough margin to successfully operate even<br>
in worst-case crosstalk noise. The SOS system minimizes or eliminates crosstalk-related CRC<br>
errors to such an extent that the transmission link may be maintained, even if at an adjusted<br>
lower (and possibly sub-optimal) data rate.<br>
The system of the present invention provides processes and constructs for producing an SOS<br>
adjustment transmission reference (e.g., bit/gain table). The system of the present invention<br>
comprehends and may accommodate various system requirements - such as minimum data rate.<br>
The system of the present invention does all of this in a simple and elegant manner; requiring<br>
minimal - or even no - data exchange during SOS operation. The present invention provides<br>
reliable communication for SOS information; as well as measures to maintain certain<br>
performance parameters (e.g., delay, INP) at appropriate levels after SOS.<br>
In the G993.2 standard, On-line reconfiguration (OLR) allows changes to PMD without<br>
interruption of service and without errors. Types of OLR include bit swapping, and seamless<br>
rate adaptation (SRA). Bit swapping reallocates bits and power among allowed sub-carriers,<br>
without modification of total data rate or higher layer features of the physical layer. In ADSL<br>
and VDSL2, a bit/gain table contains information of number of bits per tone, and corresponding<br>
gain values. For each tone, two bytes are used: 4 bits for the number of bits carried by each tone,<br>
and 12 bits for the corresponding gain of the tone.<br>
Bit swapping reconfigures the bit and gain (bi, gi) parameters, without changing total data<br>
rate or any other PMD or PMS-TC control parameters. In the G.993.2 standard, a bit swapping<br>
protocol is provided. More specifically, when a particular receiver determines that a bit swap is<br>
needed, it sends a bit swap request over an overhead channel (typically referred to as the EOC-<br><br><br>
VDSL overhead channel). A bit swap acknowledge command specifies a specific symbol count<br>
on which a corresponding swap will be implemented. The acknowledge command is used to<br>
simplify detection of the implementation of a new bit distribution. The acknowledgement,<br>
however, slows down swapping speed, and may cause failure if the acknowledgement is not<br>
received. Bit swap can only move some data bits, from a limited number of deteriorated tones to<br>
other tones with extra SNR margin, while keeping total data rate unchanged. Bit swap is not,<br>
however, adequate to compensate for sudden increase of noise at many tones.<br>
The mechanism of SRA - as defined in ADSL and VDSL2 - is such that a receiver monitors<br>
real time noise margin, and compares it with predefined upshift and downshift noise margins. If<br>
a real time noise margin exceeds a range of downshift and upshift noise margin for a time period,<br>
exceeding some predefined time interval, the receiver determines an adjustment transmission<br>
reference (i.e., a new bit/gain table) and requests an SRA operation via an EOC message to the<br>
transmitter. Upon receiving the SRA request, and the new bit/gain table, the transmitter sends an<br>
SRA synchronous signal - indicating the switching of the bit/gain table - to the receiver, and<br>
both sides switches to the new bit/gain table synchronously.<br>
VDSL2 uses up to 4k tones. If the bit/gain table needs to be adjusted for each bin, the<br>
information to be exchanged during SRA can exceed 8K bytes - which can take quite a long<br>
time to go through EOC message channels. SRA for ADSL and VDSL2 also limits the number<br>
of bins with changed bit/gain to 128. To change all 4k tones, SRA has to be executed 32 times.<br>
When a sudden increase of a crosstalk, generated by adjacent devices (e.g., modem pairs),<br>
increases noise level much higher than the noise margin, bit error rate can increase dramatically<br>
and render communication links unreliable. Due to the manner in which an overhead channel is<br>
multiplexed into a transmission frame, reliability and error rates of the overhead channel are<br>
essentially the same as that of data transmission. Therefore, the EOC channel (as part of the<br>
communication links) also becomes unreliable. A high bit error rate severely impacts SRA and<br>
causes it to fail, due to errors during exchange of the new bit/gain table, and<br>
request/acknowledgement through the EOC channel. When the noise level increases<br>
significantly, loss of margin results in high error rates on the overhead channel. It thus becomes<br>
very difficult, if not impossible, to pass messages when SNR margin becomes negative.<br><br><br>
In contrast, the present invention discloses an emergency rate adjustment (SOS) system that<br>
sustains service and avoids service disruptions due to retraining. A receiver may initiate a<br>
request for switching to a non-disruptive, lower bit-rate configuration known to both sides in the<br>
event of a sudden and sustained increase in noise such as crosstalk. In certain embodiments of<br>
the present invention, transceivers on both sides may store multiple bit/gain tables; one for<br>
normal operation and the other(s) for SOS operation.<br>
During initialization, a receiver may produce multiple (e.g., two) bit/gain tables: one based<br>
on current channel parameters for normal usage; and other table(s) for an adjusted performance<br>
level (e.g., more conservative as compared to the first table). The adjusted performance table<br>
may be produced based on current channel parameters, in addition to some predefined rule(s)<br>
(e.g., predefined virtual noise). The rule(s) provide for an adjusted performance table, and<br>
corresponding link, having sufficient noise margin for operation even in worst case conditions<br>
(e.g., all adjacent transceiver pairs in a bundle start initialization).During an exchange phase of<br>
initialization, the bit/gain tables are exchanged between receiver and transmitter, and stored in<br>
both. The adjusted performance table(s) may be updated later.<br>
In other embodiments, both sides (receiver and transmitter) store a formula or process for<br>
calculating new bit/gain tables from a current bit/gain table. The formula may be predefined in<br>
CO-MIB, and exchanged during initialization, to then be stored in both CO and CPE. The<br>
formula may also be calculated during initialization by a receiver, and then communicated to a<br>
transmitter. When the receiver initiates an SOS operation, both transmitter and receiver calculate<br>
a new bit/gain table from this predefined formula; and then switch to operation using the new<br>
table synchronously. Both sides use the same formula, rendering the new tables in both sides<br>
identical.<br>
If a predefined formula is utilized, VTU-O and VTU-R may use the formula to generate an<br>
adjustment bit/gain table, and switch to operation with it. The parameters of the formula may be<br>
predefined by an operator, or during initialization, or decided at the time of an SOS operation.<br>
Several illustrative embodiments of such are described below. Because actual crosstalk may not<br>
be flat, and actual crosstalk effects are highly dependent on frequency, a flat rate adjustment (i.e.,<br><br><br>
reduction) may be too conservative in some applications - causing a disproportionate bit rate<br>
reduction.<br>
In order to better match actual crosstalk characteristics, one or more (multiple) frequency<br>
break points may be defined. Each break point includes a starting frequency of the frequency<br>
band, within which the same bit reduction value (br) is applied to all used bins. Different br<br>
values may be defined for different frequency bands to better address crosstalk spectrum in the<br>
bundle. Specifically, at the nth break point, (fn, brn) may be defined - wherein is the starting bin<br>
index, and brn is the bit reduction for bin (fn) to (fn+1 - 1). The break points may be determined<br>
by types of services (e.g., ADSL, ADSL2+, or VDSL2) provided in a given line (i.e., cable).<br>
From PSD defined in standards for those services, an operator may determine a likely crosstalk<br>
spectrum. Typically, crosstalk on DSL may have band edges at 138KH, 276KHz, 552K,<br>
104MHz, 2.208MHz; or in the case of VDSL2, and number of band edges. Break points may<br>
also be determined by, for example: channel noise measurement history; transceivers during the<br>
Channel Analysis &amp; Exchange phase of Initialization; or operator experience and measurement<br>
history of the line.<br>
The value brn may be determined by crosstalk (near end crosstalk - NEXT, and far end<br>
crosstalk - FEXT) as calculated for the data rate setting of the line, and the types of DSL services<br>
and number of pairs provided in a given line. The value brn may be determined by bit loading<br>
numbers of a band, if brn is determined during the Channel Analysis &amp; Exchange phase of<br>
Initialization. The value brn may be determined by operator experience and/or measurement<br>
history of the line, or any other proper ways.<br>
The values of function (fn, brn) may be exchanged through MIB in the handshake (e.g., as<br>
determined by operator experience, or calculated by crosstalk module), or during Initialization<br>
procedure(s). If there are two or more (fn, brn) - for example, (fn, brn) exchanged in MIB, and<br>
another (fn, brn) generated during Initialization procedure - the final (fn, brn) may be generated in<br>
a manner similar to, for example, the generation of transmit PSDMASK. The values of function<br>
(fn, brn) may be exchanged between CO and CPE in handshake phase, or during an Initialization<br>
procedure. The values of function (fn, brn) may be exchanged between CO and CPE in Channel<br><br><br>
Analysis&amp; Exchange phase, or another phase during the initialization procedure. These values<br>
may be updated at a later time (e.g., during "Showtime").<br>
If there is no minimum date rate limit when SOS initiates, certain embodiments may employ<br>
a pre-defined b, reduction value br of each band (brn),to generate a new bit/gain table - using,<br>
for example, a process of the form: for each tone index i, compute new bi value as bi' = bi- br, if<br>
bi'
minimum data rate requirements; levels below which minimum service may not be provided,<br>
rendering the connection useless. If a predefined minimum data rate has to be kept when SOS is<br>
initiated, minimum data rate needs to be taken into consideration when generating a new bit/gain<br>
table. If minimum data rate is taken into consideration, and predefined br values are applied<br>
(based on process above) to generate a new bit/gain table, minimum data rate requirements may<br>
still not be satisfied due to on-line Reconfiguration (OLR) of DSL (e.g., seamless rate adaptation<br>
(SRA)) and bit swap (BS).<br>
If the SOS rate calculated - based on predefined br values and bitloading at the time of SOS<br>
activation - is lower than a minimum rate threshold, certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention may be implemented to decrease br values. In certain embodiments, for example, one<br>
br value at a time may be decreased, followed by calculation of the rate. If the rate is still too<br>
low, the next br may be decreased. For example, decrease br1 first, then br2, etc., until the last br;<br>
and then return to br1 and repeat, if necessary, until the rate is not below, and close to, the<br>
threshold. Some of these adjustment process embodiments may provide even finer granularity<br>
by applying a decreased br value, bin by bin within the group, until the threshold requirement is<br>
satisfied. Some embodiments may, for example, apply a decreased br from a first bin (or a last<br>
bin) and repeat, bin by bin, until the threshold is satisfied. In these adjustment process<br>
embodiments, granularity is down to a single bit.<br>
If the SOS rate calculated - based on predefined br values and bitloading at the time of SOS<br>
activation - is much higher than a minimum rate threshold, and the SOS rate needs to be kept<br>
close to the threshold for better robustness, certain embodiments may increase br values, for<br>
example, one br value at a time, and calculating rate. If the rate is still too high, the next br is<br>
increased. For example, increase br1 first, then br2, etc., until the last br, and then return to br1<br><br><br>
and repeat, if necessary, until the rate is close to the minimum threshold. If reducing bitloading<br>
at higher frequencies is preferred, the order of the process above may be reversed. Namely,<br>
increase br starting from the highest group to lower groups. Granularity is reduced by not<br>
increasing all br values together. For even finer granularity, some of these adjustment process<br>
embodiments may apply the increased br value, bin by bin, within the group until the threshold is<br>
satisfied. Some embodiments may, for example, apply an increased br from the first bin (or the<br>
last bin) and repeat, bin by bin, until the threshold is satisfied. In these adjustment process<br>
embodiments, granularity is down to a single bit.<br>
A br value may be determined in real time by a receiver, and communicated to a transmitter.<br>
In certain embodiments, br values may be adapted - based upon line conditions - when SOS is<br>
initiated. Instead of using pre-defined br values, a receiver computes br values, based on a quick<br>
estimate of channel conditions at that time, and communicates those br values to a transmitter via<br>
a robust message protocol. Minimum data rate may also be maintained by, for example, a<br>
process similar to the second process described above - performed, for example, by the receiver<br>
when it computes br values.<br>
To trigger and possibly transmit a few messages, a reliable communication link is essential.<br>
Because noise margin at the time of SOS initiation is typically negative, regular communication<br>
links may be unreliable. For a robust message protocol, an EOC channel may be used to<br>
transmit a message carrying br information. Using repeating, PN, or other orthogonal sequences<br>
to encode this EOC message may enhance robustness and ensure that the message can be<br>
received correctly. Also a robust channel dedicated to transmitting SOS information may be<br>
defined. Referring now to frame structure 300 of FIG. 3, other embodiments may provide a sync<br>
frame 302 to transfer SOS information. In order to communicate SOS information more reliably<br>
(with negative noise margin), coding schemes may be provided in the sync frame.<br>
Certain embodiments of such coding schemes may take the following form(s). In a sync<br>
frame 302, a 4-QAM signal may be transmitted at each bin - with the 4-QAM signal at each bin<br>
being selected by 2 bits from a PN sequence. Because 2m bits of SOS information is<br>
transmitted, a first m bins - with each bin carrying 2 bits - may be used to transmit a total of 2m<br><br><br>
bits. The value of m is very small, because only a very limited amount of SOS information needs<br>
to be transmitted.<br>
At each bin, 2 bits of SOS information is combined (i.e., exclusive-OR) with 2 bits from a<br>
regular PN sequence, to select one of four QAM signals. VDSL2 may use numerous bins. After<br>
the first m bins, the same 2m bits are applied to the next m bins, and so on, until all bins are used.<br>
2m bits may be applied to each group of m bins by simply repeating, or by some form of coding.<br>
For example, if 8 bits are to be transmitted, 4 bins are needed to transmit them. If VDSL uses<br>
2048 bins, those 8 bits are transmitted 512 times - as either repeated or coded bits. This may<br>
provide approximately 27dB SNR improvement - rendering communication much more reliable.<br>
Since crosstalk tends to be less severe at lower frequencies, signals at lower bins are usually<br>
more reliable for a receiver. When combining signals in multiple groups, a receiver may assign<br>
greater weight to lower bins for even more reliable detection.<br>
In order to ensure a link surviving suddenly increased wideband noise, such as crosstalk, an<br>
adjustment bit/gain table comprehends target noise margin and BER, even for worst-case<br>
conditions - i.e., all other adjacent transceiver pairs on the same line initialize while the primary<br>
pair is operating. If there is a minimum data rate threshold during such an SOS condition, the<br>
adjustment bit/gain table - or the adjustment process - must take that threshold into<br>
consideration. The link rate of an adjustment bit/gain table may be low. Nonetheless, the loop<br>
may not always be in worst-case condition. SRA may then be implemented after SOS to adapt<br>
the rate to an appropriate level, with proper noise margin. When noise decreases, SRA may<br>
adaptively increase data rate, and an optimal loop rate may be realized. As such, SRA may have<br>
optimal robustness, due to a very low BER provided by the SOS system.<br>
During initialization, an SOS configuration may be determined. In instances where two<br>
bit/gain table are utilized, configuration may be defined utilizing pre-defined, dedicated bit/gain<br>
tables, separate from those used during normal data mode. Alternatively , they may be defined<br>
using a predefined adjustment process (i.e., formula) for deriving actual bit/gain tables. This<br>
configuration information must be communicated between two modems during initialization. In<br>
embodiments where a formula is used to calculate adjustment bit/gain table(s), only the formula<br>
need be exchanged through CO-MIB - requiring significantly less memory than exchanging<br><br><br>
entire bit/gain tables. Parameters for a formula may be pre-defined, or selected in real-time by a<br>
receiver - in which case selected parameters must be communicated to the transmitter.<br>
After SOS is initiated, data rate may be reduced. Reduction in data rate may increase delay<br>
at an interleaver, as well as impulse noise protection (INP). If the delay is to be kept<br>
approximately constant after SOS, while satisfying INP requirements, an interleaver's depth Dp<br>
may be reduced. An illustrative embodiment of such a process is described below:<br>
- Compute data rate reduction ratio before and after SOS as DRRR = Lp/Lp'<br>
i. The new Dp' is obtained by rounding (Dp/DRRR), up or down. Other<br>
interleaver &amp; FEC parameters Ip, Rp, NFEC and qp remain unchanged.<br>
- Determine if Dp' is co-prime with Ip. Because Ip is unchanged, Dp' has to be<br>
co-prime with Ip.<br>
- If Dp' is not co-prime with Ip, Dp' is increased by 1 until it becomes co-prime<br>
with Ip.<br>
With this approach, the ratio of Lp/Dp remains approximately constant. Thus, delay and INP are<br>
approximately constant before and after SOS. Because Dp' is calculated using the same formula<br>
at both sides (i.e., receiver and transmitter), it does not need to be communicated therebetween.<br>
In instances where changing Dp is optional, such change(s) may be exchanged during<br>
handshake. If this feature is not supported, Dp will not be changed. In such instances, with<br>
reduced Lp, INP and delay may increase. After SOS, data rate is reduced, and has smaller Lp.<br>
INPmin is not violated during that time.<br>
Change in Lp - based on non-erasure decoding - impacts INPP, as described below.<br>
According to current standards, when erasure decoding is not used, INPP is computed by:<br><br><br><br>
If interleave and FEC parameters Dp I, Rp, NFEC and qp are stable, then decreasing Lp may cause<br>
increasing in INP_no_erasurep. As such, INPP (after SOS) &gt; INPP (before SOS) &gt; INPmin. In<br>
this case, there is no problem in meeting the required INPmtn.<br>
A consideration of interleave delayp is also useful. According to current standards, INPP may<br>
be expressed:<br><br>
Thus, if interleaver and FEC parameters such as Dp I, Rp, NFEC and qp remain unchanged,<br>
decreasing Lp may cause increased interleave delayp.<br>
Following these illustrative formulas, both INP and delay are directly proportional to Dp, but<br>
inversely proportional to Lp. With the present invention, Dp and Lp vary proportional to one<br><br>
another. As a result, the ratio of Dp and Lp remains approximately the same and, thus, INP and<br>
delay are approximately the same before and after SOS.<br>
