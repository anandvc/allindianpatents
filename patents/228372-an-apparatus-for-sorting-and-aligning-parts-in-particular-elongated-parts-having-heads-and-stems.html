				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a part sorting and aligning apparatus.<br>
Machines are commercially available which extract parts from a pile and place them<br>
in a row for further processing. For elongated parts with heads and stems, such as engine<br>
valves or bolts, separating conveyors are commercially available from Spectrum Automation<br>
Company, and step feeders are available from companies such as Koeberlein. But, after the<br>
parts are separated, the parts must be oriented and aligned prior to further processing or<br>
machining. Typically, this is accomplished by placing the valves into a "V" channel and<br>
vibrating them until they fall into a correct orientation for movement onto a conveyor. Valves<br>
which are not correctly aligned fall back into the original pile for later pickup. Currently, parts,<br>
such as engine valves, are separated using a vibratory separator. But, the use of a vibratory<br>
separators increases maintenance expenses, and increases set up expenses because minor<br>
changes in part characteristics requires a new vibratory machine set up. Also, many parts<br>
which do not fall back into the machine have to be manually picked up from around the<br>
machine.<br>
A prong sorting apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,998,119, issued 29 August<br>
1961 to Winberg. The '119 apparatus includes a tilted rotary hopper with a flat bottom disk<br>
or wheel surrounded by a skirt. A plurality of pegs are arranged on the bottom. The pegs<br>
engage and pick up prongs from a hopper positioned adjacent to the hopper. A single rail<br>
pick-off or transfer member receives successive prongs from the pegs for transporting the<br>
pegs to another location. The pegs and the transfer member of the '119 apparatus are not<br>
capable of picking up or transferring elongated parts with heads and stems, such as engine<br>
valves. It would be desirable to have a part sorting and aligning apparatus which can pick<br>
up and align engine valves and which does not require a vibratory machine.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a part sorting and aligning<br>
apparatus which can pick up and align elongated parts with heads and stems, such as<br>
engine valves.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide such a part sorting and aligning<br>
apparatus which does not require a vibratory machine.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by the present invention, which comprises a<br>
part sorting and aligning apparatus which can pick up and align elongated parts with heads<br>
and stems, such as engine valves. The part sorting and aligning apparatus includes a tilted<br>
rotary wheel positioned adjacent a supply of valves. The wheel is rotated by a motor acting<br>
through a speed reducer. Part pickup members are pivotally mounted on the wheel via<br>
bearings, and include a weighted bar so that gravity maintains the pickup members and the<br><br>
valves in a desired orientation as the wheel rotates. The pickup members are arranged in a<br>
plurality of arrays which are spaced apart and evenly distributed over the outer portion of the<br>
wheel. Pairs of pick-off rails are positioned to pick the valves off of each pickup member of<br>
each array so that the valves slide down the rails and away from the wheel.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a part sorting and aligning apparatus 10 is designed for<br>
picking parts, such as engine valves 12, out of a pile of valves, aligning or orienting the<br>
valves and conveying the valves to another location. The apparatus 10 includes a tilted disk<br>
or wheel 14 mounted for rotation adjacent to a valve holding member or hopper 16. The<br>
wheel 14 is rotated by a motor 18 which is coupled to a central shaft 20 of the wheel via a<br>
speed reducer 22. A cylindrical annular rim 24 projects axially away from the motor side of<br>
the wheel 14. The rim is received by guides 26 which are supported by a base 28. The<br>
motor can be an electric motor, a hydraulic motor or the equivalent.<br>
A plurality of valve pickup members or hooks 30 are mounted for rotation on the<br>
wheel 14, preferably in a plurality of arrays 32 spaced apart around the surface of the wheel<br>
14. Preferably, as best seen in Fig. 1, each array 32 extends from an outer point near an<br>
outer edge of the wheel member 14 to an inner point positioned radially inwardly from the<br>
outer point, and each array 32 forms an array line which is at an angle with respect to a<br>
radial line R extending from the outer point to a center of the wheel 14.<br>
As best seen in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, each pickup member or hook 30 is received by a<br>
corresponding bore 40 which extends axially through the wheel 14. Each pickup member 30<br>
includes a cylindrical shaft 42 received by a bearing 44 which is mounted in the bore 40.<br>
Each pickup member 30 also includes a pair of arms 46, 48 which extend away from the<br><br>
shaft 42 and form a generally V-shaped structure with a slot 50 therebetween, as best seen<br>
in Fig. 5. A cylindrical locking collar 52, (such as are commercially available from most<br>
bearing manufacturers) is mounted on the end of the shaft 42 opposite the arms 46, 48. The<br>
collar 52 has an outer diameter which is larger than a diameter of the shaft 42. The upper<br>
end of a weight bar 54 is attached, such as by welding to the end of shaft 42. Since the<br>
bearing 44 permits the pickup members 30 to freely rotate wiih respect to the wheel 14, the<br>
weight of the bar 54 tends to cause the bar 54 to hang vertically downwardly from its upper<br>
end as the wheel 14 rotates. This helps to maintain the pickup member 30 oriented so that<br>
the slot 50 extends generally vertically, and so that the valves 12 held by the pickup<br>
members 30 will also hang in a substantially vertical orientation, as seen in Figs. 1 and 4.<br>
Hopper 16 includes a bottom wall 56 and three side walls 58, 60 and 62, and is open<br>
towards the wheel 14. As best seen in Figs. 6-8, the bottom wall 56 has an opening 64<br>
against which is slidably mounted a plate 66. As best seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the ends of the<br>
plate 66 are supported by L-shaped support members 68 and 70 which are attached to the<br>
bottom of wall 56 outwardly from the ends of the opening 64. The plate 66 is also held<br>
between the surface of the wheel 14 and three stop members 72, 74 and 76, which are<br>
attached to the bottom of wall 56 near the side of opening 64 opposite from wheel 14. A pair<br>
of springs 78 and 80 are coupled between the plate 66 and the middle stop 74 and are<br>
biased to urge the plate 66 towards a centered position. The distance between the<br>
members 68 and 70 is larger than the length of plate 66 so that the plate 66 can slide back<br>
and forth therebetween. .<br>
The plate 66 has three pairs of slots 82, 84 and 86 which are oriented and spaced<br>
apart so that the arms 46, 48 of the hooks 30 can move therethrough as the wheel 14<br>
rotates. If each array 32 includes fewer or more than three hooks, then the plate 66 should<br>
have a corresponding number of slot pairs. Preferably, as best seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the<br>
slots have a narrow upper end and a wider lower end. This feature, together with the sliding<br>
action of the plate 66 helps assure that the hooks 30 can easily enter and move upwardly<br>
through the slots.<br>
A part transfer or pick-off assembly 90 is also positioned adjacent the wheel 14.<br>
Preferably, the transfer assembly 90 includes a plurality of pairs of rails 92, 94 and 96. Each<br>
pair of rails has an upper end 102, 104,106 positioned adjacent an upper part of the wheel<br>
14 and (as best seen in Fig. 9) slightly below the bottom of the corresponding pickup<br>
member 30 when the pickup member 30 is at or slightly past the top of its arc as the wheel<br>
14 rotates. Each pair of rails extends away from its upper end 102, 104, ,106, downwardly,<br><br>
away from the wheel 14 and generally in a direction of rotation of the upper part of the which<br>
14, as best seen in Figs. 1, 2 and 9. As best seen in Fig. 9, each pair of rails includes an<br>
inner rail 98 and an outer rail 100 spaced apart from and parallel to the inner rail 98. The<br>
opening or slot between rails 98 and 100 receives a valve 12 and positioned so that adjac<br>
pairs of rails will engage and pick the valves 12 off of the pickup members 30 as each pick<br>
member 30 is moved into a position adjacent to the upper ends 102, 104 and 106 of the re-<br>
pairs 92, 94 and 96.<br>
As the motor 18 rotates the wheel 14, the arms 48, 50 of each pickup member or<br>
hook 30 move through the slots 82, 84 and 86 in the plate 66 so that pickup members 30<br>
engage and pick up valves 12 as they move generally upwardly. The valves 12 remain in<br>
substantially vertical orientation as the wheel 14 rotates clockwise, viewing Fig. 1.<br>
Eventually, as each valve 12 and hook 30 are near the top of their arc as the wheel 14<br>
rotates, each valve 12 will be picked off of its hook 30 by a corresponding pair of the rails<br>
94, 96. Whereupon the valves 12 slide down between the rail pairs and away from the<br>
wheel 14.<br>
While the present invention has been described in conjunction with a specific<br>
embodiment, it is understood that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. For example, the<br>
present invention could be used to pick up and orient parts with heads and stems, other th<br>
engine valves. Accordingly, this invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives,<br>
modifications and variations which fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
