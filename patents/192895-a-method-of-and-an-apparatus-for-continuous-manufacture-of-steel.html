This invention relates to a method of, and an apparatus for. continuous manufacture of steel as against conventional techniques involvine the manufacture of steel in cyclic or batch processes. which are discontinuous.<br>
Apart from the method proposed herein bein« continuous. it is simple, with considerably less handling equipment and infrastructure, and consequent low capital investment compared to the current methods in practice.<br>
The method of continuous manufacture of steel. according to this invention, comprises the steps of causing molten iron to flow in a defined, enclosed channel; regulating the flow of the molten metal in the channel to the full width thereof and to the desired depth; introducing additives into the molten metal during its flow in the channel; allowing the molten  metal to fall freely into an  enclosed  chamber<br><br>
communicatine with the end or the channel; blowing oxygen into the freely falling stream of molten metal, at different levels thereof, whereby the stream of molten metal is broken and gets converted into falling droplets; injecting other gases and introducing additives into the chamber to react or combine with the molten metal to form the desired final composition of steel: collecting the slag and molten metal in a receiver to settle one above the other; and removing the slag and metal by tapping the same separately and continuously therefrom, the waste gases being allowed to escape to atmosphere after they are cleaned.<br>
Thi.s invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings the single Figure in which illustrates, schematically, one of possible embodiments of the  apparatus according to this invention and the method by which it is carried out.<br><br>
The embodiment comprises a defined, enclosed channel for permitting the flow of molten iron therethrough.<br>
Means are provided for regulating the flow of molten iron in the channel to the full width thereof and the desired depth.   In the embodiment illustrated such means comprise the controller B.<br>
First inlet means A are provided for the channel C for permitting additives such as ferro-alloys or lirne to be introduced into the molten metal during its flow in the channel.<br>
An enclosed chamber D, communicates with the end of the channel, for enabling the molten metal to fall freely thereinto.<br>
Second inlet means E are provided for the chamber D for<br><br>
biowing; oxygen into the tailing stream of molten iron, through a plurality of nozzles N disposed at different levels on the wall of the chamber. This causes the falling stream of molten metal to be broken into droplets of molten iron.<br>
The nozzles N are so positioned that the oxygen is blown in an upward direction to meet and break the descending stream of molten metal. Thus broken, the droplets of the molten metal float and pass through a rich and pure oxygen atmosphere, thereby considerably increasing the surface area and duration of contact between the impure metal (iron) and oxygen; affording the best conditions for a thorough reaction; and thus ensuring that the full quantity of the molten metal comes directly into contact with the oxygen, so that impurities are burnt off quickly and efficiently.<br>
Third  inlet means F are provided for the said  chamber<br><br>
ror injecting other gases, such as xnert gases, and introducing additives such as powdered fluxes or lime through the nozzles/ports M to to react or combine with the liquid metal to form the desired final composition of steel. In this case also the nozzles/ports are positioned such that the gases and additives travel upwardly in the chamber to meet the descending droplets of the molten metal.<br>
Droplets of the molten metal, now refined, along with the slag fall into a receiver H where the purified metal P (steel) settles at the bottom under the foaming slag S. Falling metal droplets pass through the slag layer and are thus further refined. The purified metal at the bottom and the slag above are tapped continuosily and separately at different levels and<br>
orientations of the receiver R.<br>
Outlet means 0 are provided for the escape of waste<br><br>
gases to atmosphere, after they are cleaned o± dust and other harmful impurities.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
.A method of continuous manufacture of steel, comprising the steps of causing molten iron to flow in a defined, enclosed channel; regulating the flow of the molten metal in the channel to the full width thereof and to the desired depth; introducing additives into the molten metal during its flow in the channel; allowing the molten metal to fall freely into an enclosed chamber communicating with the end of the channel; blowing oxygen into the freely falling stream of molten metal, at different levels thereof, whereby the stream of molten metal is broken and gets converted into falling droplets; injecting other gases and introducing additives into the chamber to react or combine with the molten metal to form the desired final composition of steel; collecting the slag and molten metal in a receiver to settle one above the other; and removing the slag and metal by tapping the same separately and continuously therefrom, the waste gases being allowed to escape to atmosphere after they are cleaned.<br><br>
2.A method as claimed in Claim i wherein the oxygen xs blown and the gases/additives are injected/introduced into the chamber in an upward direction to meet the descending stream or droplets of molten metal.<br>
3.A method of continuous manufacture of steel substantially as herein described with reference to. and as illustrated by, the accompanying drawings.<br>
4. An apparatus for the continuous manufacture of .steel, comprising a defined, enclosed channel for permitting the flow of molten iron; means for regulating the flow of the molten metal in the channel to the full width thereof and the desired depth; first inlet means provided for the channel for p)ermitting additives to be introduced into the molten metal during its flow in the channel; an enclosed chamber, communicating with the end of the channel, for enabling the molten metal to fall freely thereinto; second inlet means provided for the chamber for blowing oxygen into the falling stream<br><br>
of molten iron, through a plurality of nozzles disposed at different levels on the wall of the chamber, thereby breaking the falling stream into droplets of molten metal; third inlet means provided for the said chamber for injecting other gases and introducing additives into the chamber to react or combine with the molten metal to form the desired final composition of steel; a receiver whereinto the molten droplets fall along with the slag, the molten metal settling down with the slag afloat thereon, the said molten metal and slag being taken out of the said chamber by tapping the same separately and continuoslly therefrom; and outlet means for the escape of waste gases to atmosphere.<br>
5.An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the nozzles and ports are positioned  such that the oxygen, gases/additives are blown upwardly into the descending stream or droplets of the molten metal.<br>
6.An apparatus for the continuous manufacture of steel<br><br>
substantially as herein described with reference to. and as illustrated by, the accomnpanying drawings.<br><br></td>
