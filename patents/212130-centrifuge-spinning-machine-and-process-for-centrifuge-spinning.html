DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a centrifuge spinning machine for the manufacture of yarn  and a process for the centrifuge spinning of yarn <br>
A centrifuge or pot spinning machine and a process of the generic type are known, for example from DE 42 08 039 Al and DE 43 24 039 Al. Centrifuge spinning machines of this type comprise as a rule a plurality of spinning stations, which in each case feature a spinning pot (centrifuge) capable of being offset in rotation. Fibre band is fed to such spinning stations by means of a fibre band drawing device, for preference a drafting device, said fibre being spun to form a thread under the effect of the spinning pot rotating about its mid-axis. The thread in this situation runs through a tubular thread guide and emerges at its outlet, forming a yarn shank.<br>
The thread in this situation is deposited on the inner wall of the spinning pot, in layers, as what is referred to as spinning cake. This deposit of spinning cake occurs as a result of a relative movement between the thread guide and the spinning pot in the axial direction. This relative movement, also designated as jig or traversing movement, is created by means of a drive device for the thread guide and/or the spinning pot .<br>
At the conclusion of the spinning period, or after a<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
predetermined quantity of yarn is accumulated in the spinning pot respectively, the material which has been spun up to that time is wound onto a rewinding bobbin which is held ready on the thread guide.<br>
From DE 41 02 549 Al a ring spinning device is known, with a drive device to create a relative axial movement between a runner circulating on a spinning ring and a yarn carried arranged on a spindle bearing plate. The drive device comprises, for example, a raising carriage, which is capable of being displaced by means of a spindle arrangement. The drive for the spindles is effected for preference by an electric motor.<br>
With these known drive devices, it is of disadvantage that a relatively complicated arrangement is to be provided for, which requires a relatively large area for the structure. In addition to this, the free-lying drive spindle requires a relatively high degree of maintenance, since it is strongly inclined to produce lint, especially in the environment of a spinning plant in which fibre fly is prevalent.<br>
The invention is based on the objective of creating a device and a process with which, in a simple manner, a relative movement can be attained between a thread guide and a spinning pot.<br>
According to the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a centrifuge spinning machine, Due to the fact that an actuating element of the drive device is directly connected in terms of effect with the thread guide, it is possible to advantage to do without the arrangement of intermediate transfer elements. As a result of this, on the one hand a reduction is achieved in the mass<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
which is to be driven, so that the energy involvement for creating a relative movement between the thread guide and the spinning pot can be minimised. This causes the effectiveness of the entire centrifuge spinning device to be increased. In addition to this, due to the direct engagement of the actuating element of the drive device on the thread guide, it is possible for the space to be reserved for the structure of the drive device to be reduced to the minimum necessary. In addition to saving space for the structure, a substantial simplification of assembly is also achieved.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made for the drive device to be an electric motor, the rotor of which is connected in terms of effect to the thread guide, whereby for preference the rotor is a cylinder, which accommodates the thread guide as a positive fit. As a result of this, the transfer of the drive energy of the electric motor onto the thread guide is possible in a particularly easy manner, since the rotor of the electric motor takes effect directly on the thread guide. In particular, this makes possible a very precise positioning of the thread guide, since, due to the absence of intermediate transfer elements, tolerance errors, slippage errors, or similar problems can be avoided.<br>
An advantageous embodiment can be attained if the rotor of the electric motor, features internal toothing, which engages with an outer toothing arrangement of the thread guide. As a result, a reliable positive-fit connection is achieved between the rotor and the thread guide. By means of the outer thread of the thread guide and the corresponding inner thread of the rotor, the relative movement of the thread guide in relation to the spinning pot can be adjusted so as to<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
be precisely capable of reproduction.<br>
In addition to this, provision is made, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, for the electric motor to be a stepped motor.  As a result of this, by means of an appropriately defined actuation of the stepped motor, and exact axial displacement of the thread guide respectively, precise positioning is attained relative to the spinning pot. Corresponding to the actuation of the stepped motor, a proportional displacement of the thread guide takes place, so that the spinning cake deposited on the inner circumference of the spinning pot is characterised by a uniform deposit of thread.<br>
According to the invention, the objective is further attained by means of a process.  Due to the fact that the thread guide, in order to attain the axial movement, is subjected to a drive force directly by means of the drive device, a very precise relative movement of the thread guide to the spinning pot can be achieved. This direct engagement of the drive force on the thread guide leads to a minimisation of the positioning errors during the relative movement of the thread guide. This allows for the quality of the spinning cake obtained to be optimised to a high degree.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the invention are derived from the other features set forth in the Sub-Claims .<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail hereinafter on the basis of an embodiment represented in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
_ 5 _<br>
These show:<br>
Fig. 1 A centrifuge spinning station according to the invention, in a side view, and partially in section,<br>
Fig. 2  The twist securing device for the thread guide, in an enlarged scale.<br>
The figures show a spinning station in a centrifuge or pot spinning machine. Centrifuge spinning machines as a rule comprise a plurality of spinning stations 10 of this kind, which are arranged either in a row or in a ring, lying next to one another. Each spinning station 10 is provided with a centrifugal spinning device 12, which is shown in Figure 1 in a schematic longitudinal section. The centrifugal spinning device 12 comprises a spinning pit (centrifuge) 14, mounted on bearings such as to be rot a table and capable of being driven, in the interior 16 of which a thread guide 18 engages. The longitudinal axis 22 of the thread guide 18 coincides in this case with the axis of rotation 24 of the spinning pot 14.<br>
By means of the thread guide 18, a roving yarn 26' , stretched in a stretching device 32, is guided into the spinning centrifuge 14, and is subsequently spun under the effect of the rotaing spinning centrifuge 14 to form a thread 26. The thread 2 6 emerging from the thread guide outlet 36, forming a thread shank 28, is in this situation deposited on the inner wall 30 of the spinning centrifuge 14, as what is referred to as spinning cake 20.<br>
A drive device 38 is allocated to the thread guide 18, by means  of which a relative axial movement  of the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
thread guide 18 and therefore of its outlet 36 to the spinning centrifuge 14 can be predetermined. The relative movement of the thread guide 18 is effected in this context on the one hand in a jigging or transverse manner, and, on the other, the thread guide 18 is constantly being displaced somewhat downwards, so that the spinning cake 20 attains what is referred to as a cop winding.<br>
The drive device 38 is for preference designed as a stepped motor 40, which is capable of actuation by means of a control device 42. The stepped motor 40 comprises a fixed-position bearing-mounted stator 44 and a rotor 4 6 arranged inside the stator. The structure and mode of effect of stepped motors 4 0 are generally known, so that there is no need to go into further details of these in the present description.<br>
The rotor 46 is designed as a cylinder 48, which has an inner thread 50. The inner thread 50 engages with an outer thread 52 of the thread guide 18. The engaging threads 50 and 52 lead to a positive-fit effect connection between the drive device 38 and the thread guide 18. The thread guide 18 itself is secured against rotation by means of a rotation securing device 58, which is represented in greater detail in Fig. 2.<br>
Function of the centrifuge spinning device:<br>
During the operation of the spinning station 10, the spinning centrifuge 14 is rotated about the axis of rotation 24 at high revolution speed by means of an electric motor drive device 64. In addition to this, roving yarn 26', which was stretched beforehand, for example in a stretching device 32, is fed into the spinning centrifuge 14 by means of a thread guide 18 .<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
The roving yarn emerging from the thread guide outlet 36 is deposited on the inner wall 30 of the spinning centrifuge 14, under the effect of the rotation flow circulating in the spinning centrifuge 14, and in this situation is spun to form a thread 26. The thread 26, forming a circumferential thread shank 28 between the thread guide outlet 36 and the inner wall 30 of the spinning centrifuge 14, is deposited on the inner wall 30 of the spinning pot 14, and forms there what is referred to as spinning cake 20.<br>
To form spinning cake 20 with the best possible respooling capacity, the thread 26 in this situation is deposited, in the manner of a cop winding, on the inner wall 30 of the spinning pot 14. This means that the thread guide 18 is, in a manner inherently known, constantly jigged to and fro by a specific and consistent lifting movement, and, in this situation, is simultaneously deposited steadily somewhat downwards in relation to the rotating spinning pot 14. As a result of this, the outlet 36 of the thread guide 18 is displaced relative to the inner wall 30 of the spinning pot 14, so that the deposit area of the thread shank 28 varies accordingly. The thread deposit technique described, which leads to the formation of a spinning cake 20 which has good respooling properties, is specified by means of the control device 42, which provides for a corresponding manually predetermined actuation of the drive device 38, or for actuation programmable by means of a computer unit.<br>
Corresponding to the actuation of the drive device 38, in this case the stepped motor 40, a rotation of its rotor 46 takes place, i.e of the cylinder 48, so that, because of the positive fit connection between the inner thread 50 of the rotor 46 and the outer thread 52 of the<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
thread guide 18, secured against rotation by means of a rotation securing device 58, an axial displacement of the thread guide 18 takes place. The rotation securing device 58 can, as indicated in Fig. 2, consist of a longitudinal groove 60 in the area of the outer thread 52 of the thread guide 18 and securing element 62. The securing element 62, fixed, for example, to be rotationally-resistant on the stator 44 of the stepped motor 40, engages in this case into the longitudinal groove 60.<br>
Due to the fact that the drive device 38 partially encompasses the thread guide 18, only an extremely small installation space is required for the arrangement of the drive device 38. In addition, this also has the advantage that the actuator element, in this case the rotor 4 6, is directly connected for the purpose of effect to the thread guide 18. As a result, an arrangement of intermediate transfer elements is not necessary. The drive force can therefore be applied directly and precisely. At the same time, the advantage is attained that the drive device 38 takes over the mounting of the thread guide 18. The latter is mounted in a partially floating manner by the drive device 38, so that it is possible to do without the additional arrangement of further bearings or similar devices.<br>
A cover 54 is also allocated to the centrifuge spinning device 12, said cover being supported on the one hand on the drive device 3 8 and, on the other, on the upper end of the thread guide 18. The cover 54 comprises an essentially flexible cylindrical casing 56, which surrounds the thread guide 18 above the drive device 38. The casing 5 6 is formed, for example, by what is referred to as a folding bellows.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The cover 54 guarantees a seal for the positive-fit connection between the thread guide 18 and the drive device 38. As a result, the situation can in particular be avoided that, during the operation of the centrifuge spinning devices 12, the fibre fly or similar substances, which are more or less necessarily created, will be able to exert any negative effect on the function of the drive device 38. Due to the flexibility of the casing 56, the cover 54 can without further ado follow the lifting movement of the thread guide 18. The seal is therefore guaranteed during each operational phase of the centrifugal spinning device 12.<br>
According to further embodiments of the invention, not shown, the positive-fit connection between the drive device 38 and the thread guide 18 can also be designed in such a way that the drive device 38 can, for example, be designed as a travelling wave motor, the actuating element of which is in a non-positive contact with the thread guide 18. As a result of this, likewise in a simple manner, a direct transfer of the drive energy onto the thread guide 18 is possible.<br><br>
