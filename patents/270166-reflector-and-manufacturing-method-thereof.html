				<td>REFLECTOR AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reflector and a method of manufacturing\a<br>
reflector of a light source such as a fluorescent lamp or a backlight of a liquid crystal<br>
display (LCD).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventional methods of manufacturing a reflector of a light source can be<br>
classified into a method using a whiter pigment/dye additive and a method including<br>
generating air bubbles in a film.<br>
Korean Patent No. 611599 entitled "White Film For Surface Light Source<br>
Reflection Member" discloses a white film including air bubbles, for a reflection<br>
member of a surface light source in which a coating layer including a light stabilizer is<br>
formed at at least one side of the white film. Since the white film exhibits a low<br>
degradation in brightness over a period of time despite heavy usage and can maintain<br>
a high quality image for a long time, it can be preferably used for an edge light of an<br>
LCD screen, a reflector of a surface light source of a direct type light, and a member<br>
used for a reflector.<br>
An edge light type that uses a cold cathode ray tube as an illumination light<br>
source and the light that can be illuminated form a edge of a light guide plate is widely<br>
used as an illumination member of a liquid crystal screen (Japanese Patent Publication<br><br>
No. 63-62104). To illuminate the liquid crystal screen, in order to efficiently use light,<br>
a reflector is installed around the cold cathode ray tube. Also, to efficiently reflect light<br>
diffused by the light guide plate toward the liquid crystal screen, a reflector is installed<br>
under the light guide plate.<br>
For a large screen such as an LCD television, since high screen brightness<br>
cannot be provided using the edge light method, a direct type light method is used.<br>
According to the direct type light method, the cold cathode ray tubes are arranged<br>
parallel to each other above a reflector. A flat shape or one obtained by molding a<br>
portion of the cold cathode ray tube in a semicircular groove shape is used as the<br>
reflector.<br>
Also, since the surface light source reflection member such as the reflector or<br>
the reflector used for a surface light source of an LCD device needs a high reflection<br>
function, a film containing a white pigment with a white pigment or white dyes, a film<br>
including micro-bubbles, or a metal plate or plastic plate to which the film is added. In<br>
particular, a film including micro-bubbles is widely used because it can provide good<br>
improvement of brightness or regularity (uniformity). Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
hei 6-322153 and Japanese Patent Publication No. hei 7-118433 each disclose a film<br>
including micro-bubbles. These publications concern technologies related to 1)<br>
mono-axial extension or biaxial extension after adding film forming resin and<br>
incompatible resin, 2) mono-axial extension or biaxial extension after adding<br>
organic/inorganic particles, 3) extrusion sheet molding using foaming gas, and 4)<br>
foaming by injecting gas in an extrusion sheet.<br><br>
Recently, micro-foaming polyethylene terephthalate (MCPET) products of<br>
Furukawa are widely used as a material for reflectors for backlights of LCD devices.<br>
The MCPET products have a high light reflectance by micro-foaming polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) resin of a pet bottle material to form a plurality of micro-bubbles in<br>
a sheet. The following Korean patent applications are related to the above-described<br>
MCPET products.<br>
(1)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0073384 entitled "Backlight Unit";<br>
(2)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0082948 entitled "LCD Module";<br>
(3)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0089231 entitled "LCD Device<br>
Backlight Assembly";<br>
(4)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0100558 entitled "LCD Device And<br>
Manufacturing Method Thereof;<br>
(5)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0046746 entitled "Backlight Unit";<br>
(6)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0078310 entitled "Optical Film And<br>
Backlight Unit Having The Same";<br>
(7)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-7005358 entitled "Optical Reflector<br>
And Manufacturing Method Thereof;<br>
(8)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0010677 entitled "Backlight<br>
Assembly And Display Device Having The Same"; and<br>
(9)	Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0016992 entitled "Backlight Unit And<br>
LCD Device".<br><br>
Products commercialized using the above conventional material for a reflector<br>
for a surface light source and major characteristics thereof are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
FIG. 1 illustrates the structure of each of the commercialized products of Table 1.<br>
The conventional products shown in FIG. 1 and Table 1 obtain a desired reflectance by<br>
added pigment/dyes, forming air bubbles inside, and extending pores through<br>
extension after adding an additive.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the principle of diffuse reflection of a reflector. Total reflection<br>
is a total of mirror reflection and diffuse reflection. Mirror reflection of light occurs<br>
when light is directly reflected from a surface of a reflector so that a reflected wave<br><br>
proceeds in a particular direction. Diffuse reflection occurs when light incident on<br>
micro-bubbles, white pigments, and crystalline particles in a reflector is reflected in all<br>
directions and externally emitted. A degree of the diffuse reflection is determined by<br>
the numbers of the micro-bubbles, the white pigments, and the crystalline particles in<br>
the reflector. In an LCD, it is advantageous to have a higher diffuse reflectance.<br>
The conventional products of Teijin Dupont, Toray, and Mitsui using the white<br>
pigment/dyes additive have reflectors which are manufactured using an additive such<br>
as CaCo3 or BaS04 having a relatively superior reflectance. The reflectors are<br>
manufactured to be thin because of the material costs of the white pigment/dyes<br>
additive. That is, when the thickness of the reflector increases, the amount of the<br>
white pigment/dyes additive included in the reflector increases accordingly, which<br>
radically increases the overall material cost. When the reflector is manufactured to be<br>
thin, the overall size of the reflector is limited. That is, when the overall size of the<br>
reflector only is increased in a state in which the reflector is thin, the reflector is twisted<br>
or warped by heat when used for a long time or may not have a sufficient structural<br>
strength so that it cannot be applied to a large screen TV over 42 inches.<br>
To address the above problem, the foaming product of Furukawa can be<br>
manufactured to be thick and applied to a large screen TV over 42 inches. However,<br>
in order to foam PET, a gas absorption process that is performed in a high-pressure<br>
gas tank for 48 hours is needed, thereby increasing production costs. Also, it is<br>
difficult to reduce a production time for the foaming product.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

provided by extending a crystalline plastic material exhibiting a superior extensibility to<br>
allow amorphous particles provided in a amorphous region to be extended in a<br>
predetermined direction so as to form a plurality of extension layers in the amorphous<br>
region. According to the present invention, since a reflector having a superior<br>
performance with a very improved reflectance can be provided due to a high diffuse<br>
reflectance by the extension layers in the amorphous region without a foaming process<br>
or an additional additive to increase the reflectance, the manufacturing process of the<br>
reflector is simplified and the manufacturing cost thereof is reduced so that productivity<br>
can be greatly improved.<br>
The reflector manufactured according to the present invention is very suitable<br>

BEST MODE<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail by explaining<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the attached drawings. Like<br>
reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements. Also, the term "sheet" used<br>
in the present specification can be either a sheet of a plate member type or a roll<br>
member type that is wound in a roll type and can be continuously supplied.<br><br>
Also, in the present specification, the term "one direction" refers to a direction in<br>
which a sheet is extended and the term "thickness direction" refers to a direction along<br>
the thickness of a sheet, which is perpendicular to the "one direction". These<br>
directions are indicated in FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the principle of reflection of a reflector manufactured of<br>
crystalline plastic according to an embodiment of the present invention. The reflector<br>
includes a crystal region and an amorphous region which are mixed. In detail, the<br>
reflector is manufactured by low-temperature extension of crystalline plastic at an<br>
extension temperature below a crystallization temperature Tc. The crystalline plastic<br>
maintains a semi-transparent state before extension. Referring to FIG. 3, while the<br>
crystal region and crystals of the reflector material (neat PP) before extension diffusely<br>
reflect light, the amorphous region in which amorphous particles are irregularly<br>
arranged transmits light so that the overall reflector is in a semi-transparent state.<br>
However, when the reflector is low-temperature extended in a predetermined direction<br>
at a temperature below the crystallization temperature Tc, the amorphous particles in<br>
the amorphous region existing in a transformable state at a temperature below the<br>
crystallization temperature are oriented so that a plurality of orientation layers<br>
(indicated as lines in FIG. 3) are formed in the amorphous region. When the<br>
extension is performed at a temperature below the crystallization temperature Tc,<br>
diffuse reflection occurs in the crystal region in a reflection capability state.<br>
Furthermore, incident light is reflected by the orientation layers in the amorphous<br>
region where no reflection has occurred, thus obtaining a high reflectance. The<br><br>
orientation layers are arranged in the predetermined direction (please refer to FIG. 3)<br>
and a thickness direction (shown in FIG. 3) perpendicular to the direction so that most<br>
of the incident light can be reflected by the reflector. Also, it is preferable to<br>
appropriately extend the crystalline plastic such that the reflectance of the reflector<br>
used in the present embodiment can be about 95% or more.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for describing a method of manufacturing a reflector by low<br>
temperature extension of crystalline plastic, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. First, pellets constituting an amorphous state of a crystalline plastic<br>
material are input to an extruder. The crystalline plastic material is preferably a<br>
polyester family such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN (polyethylene<br>
2,6-naphthalate), or PNT (polybutylene terephthalate), or a polyolefin family such as<br>
PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), HDPE (high density polyethylene), LDPE (low<br>
density polyethylene), or LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene).<br>
When resin in the polyolefin family is used, it is preferable to add a UV<br>
(ultraviolet) stabilizer to prevent yellowing after UV exposure. The UV stabilizer<br>
includes an organic based light stabilizer such as a hindered amine family, a salicylic<br>
acid family, a benzophenone family, a benzotriazole family, an anoacrylate family, a<br>
triazine family, a benzoate family, or an oxalic acid anilide family, and an inorganic<br>
based light stabilizer such as sol-gel. Detailed examples of the UV stabilizers are<br>
shown below.<br><br>

2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-metacryloxyethylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole,<br>
2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-t-butyl-5'-acryloylethylphenyl)-5-chloro-2H-benzotriazole,<br><br>
Cyanoacrylate family: ethyl-2-cyano-3,3'-diphenylacrylate<br>
Others: Nickelbis(octylphenyl)sulfide,<br>
[2,2'-thiobis(4-t-octylphenolato)-n-butylaminnickel,<br>
nickelcomplex-3-5-dit-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilphosphomonoethylate,<br>
nickeldibutyldithiocarbamate, 2-4-di-t-butylphenyl-3',5'-dit-butyl-4'-hydroxybenzoate,<br>
2,4-dit-butylphenyl-3', 5'-dit-butyl-4'-hydroxybenzoate,<br>
2-ethoxy-2'-ethyloxalicacidbisanylide,<br>
2-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2-one)-5-[(hexyl)oxy]-phenol<br>
It is preferable to use at least one of the hindered amine family, the<br>
benzophenone family, and the benzotriazole family, and more preferably, a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
In the present invention, of the above-described UV stabilizers, the type of the<br>
UV stabilizer that is added varies according to the specification of a reflector or the<br>
amount of the UV stabilizer can be appropriately determined within a range of 0.05<br>
wt% through 5 wt%. When the amount of the UV stabilizer is not greater than 0.05<br>
wt%, a yellowing removal effect is degraded, which is not preferable. When the<br>
amount of the stabilizer is not less than 5 wt%, the overall cost increases and strength<br>
is degraded, which is not preferable. The UV stabilizer is mixed with a crystalline<br>
plastic base member at an appropriate addition rate and the compound is extruded by<br>
an extrusion molder to mold an extrusion sheet.<br><br>
The extrusion sheet exhausted from the extrusion molder is cooled down at a<br>
temperature below the crystallization temperature of the crystalline plastic by passing<br>
through a cooling roll.<br>
After passing through the cooling roll, the extrusion sheet is input to an<br>
extension chamber to extend the amorphous region such that amorphous particles in<br>
the amorphous region can be oriented in one direction. In the extension process, the<br>
reflector may be manufactured in a variety of forms according to the required product<br>
specifications such as the purpose of use, reflectance, thickness, and manufacturing<br>
costs of the reflector plate.<br>
In the method of manufacturing a reflector according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, without the extrusion molder process and cooling roll process<br>
described with reference to FIG. 4, the reflector can be manufactured with only the<br>
operations of preparing a sheet in a roll member formed of crystalline plastic from the<br>
start and inputting the prepared sheet to the extension chamber at a temperature<br>
below the crystallization temperature Tc to extend the prepared sheet. The reflector<br>
exhausted from the extension chamber is slit according to the purpose of use/product<br>
specification. However, when a sheet in a separate plate shape is input to the<br>
extension chamber, the slitting process can be omitted. Then, the reflector is stacked<br>
according to a packaging standard, thus completing the reflector manufacturing<br>
process.<br>
Table 2 below shows the comparison of major characteristics between an SPP<br>
(stretched polypropylene) reflector manufactured using a low temperature extension<br><br>
method according to an embodiment of the present invention and conventional<br>
products. The SPP product manufactured using the method of the present invention<br>
uses PP (polypropylene) as the crystalline plastic material.<br><br>

of about 1 to several micrometers in size generated around the additive due to the<br>
extension. The UX film obtains a desired reflectance according to the numbers of the<br>
BaS04 particles and pores.<br>

extension direction of a PP material reflector manufactured by low temperature<br>
extension at a temperature below a crystallization temperature, according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 8 is a 1,000 times magnified SEM image<br>
of the same. FIG. 9 is a 10,000 times magnified SEM image of a section parallel to<br>
the extension direction of the PP material reflector manufactured by low temperature<br>
extension at a temperature below a crystallization temperature, according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, very fine and irregular spaces less than 1 (am in size<br>
generated as a boundary between crystal and amorphous regions are broken in a<br>
process of forming a plurality of orientation layers in the amorphous region by the low<br>
temperature extension. Such phenomenon is observed only in the image of a section<br>
perpendicular to the extension direction. These spaces can contribute to the diffuse<br>
reflectance of the reflector of FIG. 7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, compared to the MCPET product of FIG. 6, spaces similar<br>
to micro-bubbles are not observed and a plurality of orientation layers formed in the<br>
amorphous region are observed. The structure in which the orientation layers formed<br>
in the amorphous region are oriented in one direction becomes a major factor to<br>
determine the reflectance of a reflector of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a structure in which pores are not observed and the<br>
amorphous region is oriented can be clearly shown. Although pores can be observed<br>
in every section of the conventional reflectors shown in FIGS. 1, 5, and 6, in the<br><br>
reflector of the present invention, pores are not observed at all in a section parallel to<br>
the extension direction. The orientation layers in a line shape formed in the<br>
amorphous region of the reflector of the present invention manufactured of the<br>
crystalline plastic material using the low temperature extension method is a major<br>
factor in determining the reflectance of the reflector of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 10 is a graph showing results of a test of the crystallization temperature<br>
of PP used as the crystalline plastic in an embodiment of the present invention. A circle<br>
indicates the crystallization temperature of the PP of 120°C. The crystallization<br>
temperatures of materials, for example, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PE<br>
(polyethylene) used as reflector materials in the present invention are 160.8°C and<br>
70°C, respectively. Thus, in the present invention, the reflectance is improved by low<br>
temperature extending the crystalline plastic at a temperature below the crystallization<br>
temperature to orient the amorphous region.<br>
FIG. 11 is a graph showing the analysis of flowability of a crystalline plastic<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention using differential scanning<br>
calorimetry (DSC). A melting temperature Tm is a temperature at which the<br>
crystalline plastic becomes liquid. The crystallization temperature Tc is a temperature<br>
at which crystallization is complete so that the crystalline plastic is in a completely solid<br>
state. A glass transition temperature Tg is a temperature at which an amorphous<br>
portion of the crystal plastic is melted. In a conventional method of manufacturing a<br>
reflection film, a sheet having a particular thickness is extruded and, before the sheet is<br>
completely hardened, that is, the temperature is dropped from the melting temperature<br><br>
Tm to the crystallization temperature Tc, the sheet is extended in a predetermined<br>
direction or in a direction perpendicular to the predetermined direction to manufacture a<br>
reflector. In contrast, using the low temperature extension manufacturing method<br>
according to the present invention, a sheet of a crystal material hardened at a<br>
temperature below Tc is extended.<br>
FIG. 12 is a photographic image showing the comparison of characteristics of a<br>
reflector product formed of PP material according to extension temperatures of 140°C,<br>
150°C, 160°C, and 120°C from the left. The PP material extended at temperatures of<br>
140°C, 150°C, and 160°C which are above the crystallization temperature (PP: 120°C)<br>
is formed to be wide, thin, and semitransparent like a conventional film. In contrast,<br>
the PP material extended at 120°C on the right side of the image is formed to be<br>
relatively very small, white, and semitransparent. That is, when the PP material is<br>
extended at the temperatures of 140°C, 150°C, and 160°C above the crystallization<br>
temperature without an additive, the crystalline plastic is not suitable for use as a<br>
reflector. Thus, to obtain a reflectance satisfying the specification of the reflector, an<br>
additive needs to be added by several tens of percent. In contrast, according to the low<br>
temperature extension of the present invention, that is, extension at a temperature<br>
below Tc, the amorphous particles in the amorphous region are oriented in a<br>
predetermined direction and the orientation layers are formed so that a reflector<br>
exhibiting superior reflectance can be obtained. Thus, according to the present<br>
invention, sufficient reflectance can be obtained without the addition of a separate<br>
additive..<br><br>
FIG. 13 is a photographic image showing the results of different extensions of<br>
PP material at temperatures of 60°C, 80°C, and 100°C from the left, respectively. The<br>
tensile forces applied for each extension temperature are shown in Table 3 below.<br><br>
A reflector having a suitable final thickness to obtain a desired reflectance can<br>
be manufactured by appropriately selecting the extension temperature and the tensile<br>
force as an extension condition of an extension chamber according to the size and<br>
thickness of the original crystalline plastic material before the extension.<br>
FIG. 14 is a graph showing the total reflectance of a conventional MCPET<br>
product and reflectors formed of SPP (polypropylene) having various thicknesses<br>
manufactured according to an embodiment of the present invention. Table 4 below<br>
shows the initial thickness of the SPP (polypropylene) materials before the extension<br>
and the final thickness of the reflectors after the extension .<br><br><br><br>
Referring to FIG. 14, the conventional MCPET product of Furukawa has a<br>
thickness of 0.94 mm and a total reflectance of 97.9% in the wavelength range of 550<br>
nm at which visual cells are most excited. However, since each of the reflectors<br>
manufactured using the low temperature extension method according to the present<br>
invention with only a 0.5 mm thickness has a total reflectance higher than that of the<br>
conventional MCPET reflector, the thickness can be greatly reduced compared to the<br>
conventional product. Thus, a BLU (back light unit) of an LCD including the reflector<br>
of the present invention can be made compact. Also, since a high total reflectance of<br>
over 98% can be obtained with only a thickness of 0.5 mm, the reflector of the present<br>
invention can be used for not only TVs but also computer? monitors. Referring to the<br>
graph of FIG. 14, the SPP 1.2 mm product of the present invention can obtain a total<br>
reflectance of 100.3%, and thus the brightness of an LCD product including the SPP<br>
1.2 mm product can be greatly improved.<br>
FIG. 15 is a graph showing the diffuse reflectance of the conventional MCPET<br>
product and the reflectors having various thicknesses manufactured according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In order that the entire area of an LCD screen has a uniform brightness, a<br>
reflector having a superior diffuse reflectance is needed. Referring to FIG. 15, a<br>
reflector SPP (stretched polypropylene) having a thickness of 0.8 mm or more that is<br><br>
low-temperature extended using the reflector manufacturing method of the present<br>
invention has a diffuse reflectance higher than that of the conventional MCPET<br>
(Furukawa) 0.94 mm product. Also, it can be seen that even an SPP 0.5 mm product<br>
has a diffuse reflectance that is almost similar to that of the conventional MCPET<br>
product, in the wavelength range of 550 nm.<br>
Thus, a reflector manufactured using the low temperature extension method<br>
according to the present invention can obtain a significantly higher reflectance at the<br>
same thickness than a conventional MCPET product having maximal reflectance.<br>
Even when the thickness is reduced from 0.94 mm to 0.5 mm, the substantially same<br>
reflectance can be obtained.<br>
The above-described embodiment of the present invention can be modified as<br>
follows.<br>
Although in the above embodiment the orientation layers are arranged in a<br>
single predetermined direction only by performing mono-axial extension in one<br>
direction, the orientation layers can be arranged together in the predetermined<br>
direction and a direction perpendicular to the predetermined direction by performing<br>
biaxial extension for the extension in both the predetermined direction and the direction<br>
perpendicular to the predetermined direction (for example, biaxial extension).<br>
Also, although in the above embodiment a plurality of orientation layers are<br>
arranged in the amorphous region as the crystalline plastic is extended, the orientation<br>
layers can be arranged in a thickness direction in which the crystalline plastic is<br>
pressed using a deep drawing process. That is, any structure in which orientation<br><br>
layers are formed in an amorphous region using a variety of methods is within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to preferred embodiments using specific terminologies, the embodiments<br>
and terminologies should be considered in descriptive sense only and not for purposes<br>
of limitation. Therefore, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
