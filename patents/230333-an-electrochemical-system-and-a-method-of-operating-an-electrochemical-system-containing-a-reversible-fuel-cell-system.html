and their operation.<br>
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which can convert energy stored in<br>
fuels to electrical energy with high efficiencies. There are classes of fuel cells<br>
that also allow reversed operation, such that oxidized fuel can be reduced back<br>
to unoxidized fuel using electrical energy as an input. The ability to generate<br>
electricity and regenerate fuel makes these fuel cells suitable for electrical<br>
energy storage.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present inventor; have realized that regenerative or reversible<br>
operation of fuel cells can be applied beyond mere energy storage to produce<br>
fuel for uses outside the fuel cell system. A reversible fuel cell is used to<br>
reversibly store electrical energy. When electrical energy is needed from the<br>
storage system, the fuel cell Dperates in a fuel cell or discharge mode. In this<br>
mode, fuel is oxidized in the fuel cell, electricity is generated, and part or all of<br>
the reactant product is stored, if desired. The system is then recharged in an<br>
electrolysis or charge mode. In this mode, the system is recharged by supplying<br>
electrical power to the fuel cell, electrolyzing the stored and/or supplied reactant<br>
product, thereby regenerating the fuel. The regenerated fuel and optionally the<br>
regenerated oxidant are stored and available for energy generation in the fuel<br>
cell mode. The system cyclically or alternatively switches operation between the<br>
fuel cell and electrolysis mooes for any suitable number of cycles. If more<br>
electrical energy and reactant product than needed to regenerate the fuel is<br>
supplied to the reversible fuel cell over a predetermined number of operating<br>
cycles, then excess or additional fuel can be generated during the electrolysis<br>
mode during some or all of these cycles. In other words, more fuel is generated<br>
when the system operates in the electrolysis mode than the fuel needed to<br>
operate the system in the fuel cell mode. This excess fuel can be used outside<br>
the energy storage system.<br>
Figure 1 shows an energy source 100 connected via a conduit 110 to an<br>
energy storage system 120. The energy storage system 120 is connected via<br>
conduit 130 to the energy consumer 140. The energy storage system 120<br>
supplies the required power to the energy consumer 140 at all times or at<br>
predetermined times, if desired The energy supplied to the consumer comes<br>
from the energy source 100, or from the energy storage system 120, or a<br>
combination of the two. The system shown in Figure 1 decouples the amount of<br><br><br>
power drawn by the energy consumer 140 from the amount of energy drawn<br>
from the energy source 100.<br>
Examples of the energy source 100 include, but are not limited to the<br>
electrical grid, electrical generators and renewable energy sources. Preferred<br>
renewable energy sources include photovoltaic sources, such as solar cell<br>
arrays, wind power sources, such as wind turbines, tidal power sources in which<br>
power is generated from forces of ocean, sea or lake tides, and geothermal<br>
power sources in which power is generated from geothermal heat.<br>
The energy storage system 120 is preferably a reversible or regenerative<br>
fuel cell system, as will be described in more detail below with respect to Figure<br>
2. Examples of the energy consumer 140 include, but are not limited to<br>
residential households, commercial building, such as factories, hospitals and<br>
office building, electrical subgrids, and remote transmitters.<br>
The system 120 will draw more power from the energy source 100 than<br>
what is supplied to the energy consumer 140 in the electrolysis mode and the<br>
additional power is stored in the form of regenerated fuel. In the fuel cell mode<br>
the system 120 provides electrical power or energy to the consumer 140 instead<br>
of or in addition to the power provided to the consumer 140 from the energy<br>
source 100. As used herein, the terms "electrical power" and "electrical energy"<br>
refer to features of electricity provided by the energy source 100 and to features<br>
of electricity provided to the consumer 140.<br>
Figure 2 shows details cf the energy storage system 120. The system<br>
120 is preferably an electrochemical system which contains a power<br>
management system 160, a reversible fuel cell system 190, a fuel storage device<br>
210 and an optional reactant product storage device 230. The system also<br>
contains electrical connection conduits or wires 150, 170 and 180, as well as a<br>
fuel conduit 200 and a reactant product conduit 220 which allow the fuel and<br><br><br>
reactant product to pass between the reversible fuel cell system 190 and the fuel<br>
storage 210 and product storage 230 devices, respectively.<br>
The power management system 160 may be any suitable controller<br>
device, such as a computer or microprocessor, and preferably contains logic<br>
circuitry which decide how :o route the power streams. Energy from the<br>
electrical energy source 10C can be directed fully to the electrical energy<br>
consumer 140, fully to the reversible fuel cell system 190, or can be partitioned<br>
between the electrical energy consumer 140 and the reversible fuel cell system<br>
190. It is also possible to feed electrical energy back towards the electrical<br>
energy source 100, which can be applied for example where the electrical<br>
energy source 100 is the electrical grid. The power management system 160<br>
also controls from where power is supplied to the electrical energy consumer<br>
140. Power can be supplied from the electrical energy source 100, the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 190, or a combination thereof.<br>
The reversible fuel cell system 190 may comprise one or more reversible<br>
fuel cells or one or more fuel cell/electrolyzer pairs. A reversible fuel cell is a<br>
single electrochemical device which generates reactant product and electrical<br>
energy or power in the fuel cell mode and which generates fuel from reactant<br>
product and electrical energy in the electrolysis mode. A fuel cell/electrolyzer<br>
pair includes two separate devices, where a non-reversible fuel cell device<br>
generates energy, and the other electrolyzer device regenerates fuel.<br>
Examples of the fuel cells, and electrolyzers include but are not limited to<br>
high temperature fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and also<br>
include proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM). Reversible or regenerative<br>
SOFC's (SORFCs) are well suited to combine energy generation and fuel<br>
regeneration in a single device. However, other fuel cells, such as molten<br>
carbonate fuel cells, may also be used in the system 190. Preferably, the<br>
system 190 contains at least one stack of reversible fuel cells or stacks of fuel<br><br><br>
cell/electrolyzer pairs.<br>
The fuel and reactant product storage devices 210 and 230 may comprise<br>
any suitable gas, liquid or soiid storage devices. Preferably, these devices 210,<br>
230 comprise gas or liquid tanks which are opened and closed with a valve.<br>
The system 120 operates as follows. Power from the electrical energy<br>
source 100 enters through conduit 110 and conduit 150 to the power<br>
management system 160. When the reversible fuel cell system 190 operates in<br>
the fuel cell mode and provides electrical energy, fuel is fed from the fuel storage<br>
device 210 to the reversible fuel cell system 190 via the fuel conduit 200. In the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 190, the chemical energy of the fuel is converted to<br>
electrical energy, which is ther supplied to the power management system 160.<br>
Optionally, all or part of the reactant product from the reversible fuel cell system<br>
are transferred to the product storage device 230 via the reactant product<br>
conduit 220. Products that are not stored are released.<br>
When the reversible fuel cell system 190 operates in the electrolysis<br>
mode, electrical energy from the power management system 160 is provided to<br>
system 190 and the reactant pnduct from the product storage device 230 and/or<br>
from outside the electrochemical energy storage system 120 is provided via the<br>
reactant product conduit 220 to the system 190. The fuel is regenerated in the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 190 and provided to the fuel storage 210 via the fuel<br>
conduit 200.<br>
Any suitable fuels, oxidizers and reactant product may be used. One<br>
preferred example for the fuel is hydrogen which is reacted with oxygen from<br>
ambient air to produce a water reactant product. However, other fuels and<br>
oxidants can be used. For example, a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, may<br>
be used as a fuel to produce water and carbon dioxide reactant product. Other<br>
hydrocarbon gases, such as natural gas propane, hexane, etc., may also be<br><br><br>
used as fuel. Furthermore, these hydrocarbon materials may be reformed into a<br>
carbon containing fuel, such as carbon monoxide, or previously supplied carbon<br>
monoxide may also be used as fuel.<br>
If surplus energy is available from the electrical energy source 100 and an<br>
excess reactant product is supplied to the reversible fuel cell system 190, then<br>
the system 190 can generate more fuel than what is needed by the system 190<br>
in the fuel cell mode. This excess fuel may be removed from the system 120<br>
and provided for any suitable end use outside the system 120.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the system 120 when the excess reactant product is<br>
supplied to the system 120 and the excess fuel is removed from the system.<br>
The system 120 is identical to the system 120 illustrated in Figure 2 with the<br>
exception of the fuel remova device 240 and the reactant product delivery<br>
device 250. Excess fuel is povided out of the system 120 through the fuel<br>
removal device 240, while the excess reactant product is replenished through<br>
reactant product delivery device 250. The devices 240 and 250 may comprise<br>
any suitable devices which may deliver fuel and reactant product.<br>
For example, the fuel removal device 240 may be a gas or liquid conduit<br>
such as a pipe or hose which delivers fuel, such as hydrogen or methane, from<br>
the reversible fuel cell system 190 and/or from the fuel storage device 210<br>
outside the system 120. Alternatively, the device 240 may comprise a movable<br>
gas or liquid storage container, such as a gas or liquid tank, which is physically<br>
removed from the system 120 after the container is filled with fuel. If the device<br>
240 comprises a container, then the device 240 may be used as both the fuel<br>
storage device 210 while it remains in the system 120, and as a fuel removal<br>
device 240, when it is removed from the system 120.<br>
The reactant product delivery device 250 may be one or more gas or<br>
liquid conduits which deliver reactant product, such as water and/or carbon<br><br><br>
dioxide to the system 120. For example, the device may comprise a water pipe<br>
or hose which delivers water to the product storage device 230 or directly to the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 130. The device 250 may comprise two conduits<br>
when the reactant product comprises two separate components, such as water<br>
and carbon dioxide. Alternatively, the device 250 may comprise a movable gas<br>
or liquid storage container, such as a gas or liquid tank, which is physically<br>
delivered to the system 120 filled with reactant product. If the device 250<br>
comprises a container, then the device 250 may be used as both the reactant<br>
product storage device 230 whiIe it collects reactant product during the fuel cell<br>
mode, and as a reactant product delivery device 250 when it provides reactant<br>
products during the electrolysis mode.<br>
The reactant product delivery device 250 is adapted to supply excess<br>
reactant product to the reversible fuel cell system 190 operating in the<br>
electrolysis mode, in addition tc or instead of the reactant product generated by<br>
the reversible fuel cell system h the fuel cell mode. In other words, the device<br>
250 supplies the reactant product 250 in excess of the amount generated by the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 190 operating in the fuel cell mode. In one example, if<br>
the reactant product is water, than the water generated by the system 190 in the<br>
fuel cell mode is stored in the storage device 230 and the device 250 provides<br>
additional water to the device 230. In another example, the water generated by<br>
the system 190 in the fuel cell mode is discarded and the 250 provides water to<br>
the device 230 and/or to the system 190 in excess of the amount produced by<br>
the system 190 in the fuel cell mode.<br>
In either example, the excess reactant product allows the system 190 to<br>
generate an amount of fuel in the electrolysis mode in excess of the amount of<br>
fuel required to operate the system 190 in the fuel cell mode over a<br>
predetermined number of operating cycles. Thus, while anomalies, such as<br>
breakdowns, early shut downs, etc., may occur during individual fuel cell mode<br>
and electrolysis mode cycles, when the system 190 is operated cyclically over a<br><br><br>
predetermined number of such cycles, such as over 10 cycles, for example over<br>
100 to 1,000 cycles, the systen 190 produces the excess fuel.<br>
The reversible fuel cell system 190 may generate more fuel in the<br>
electrolysis mode than it consumes in the fuel cell mode over the predetermined<br>
number of cycles under several conditions. In a first preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the reversible fuel cell system operates at a higher current<br>
level in the electrolysis mode than in the fuel cell mode over the predetermined<br>
number of cycles.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the reversible fuel cell<br>
system 190 includes a SORFC stack. It is desirable for the energy storage<br>
system 120 to operate at high round-trip efficiencies, which is the ratio of energy<br>
provided to the electrical energy consumer 140 to the electrical energy from<br>
source 100. In order to achieve high round-trip efficiencies, the SORFC is<br>
preferably operated at comparably low current densities thereby minimizing<br>
losses in the SORFC. Theoretically, the round-trip efficiency increases with<br>
decreasing current density. However, the SORFC should be maintained at an<br>
elevated operating temperature which typically ranges between 600°C and<br>
1000X. The losses within the SORFC can be used to provide make-up heat to<br>
keep the SORFC at the desirec temperature. If the current and thereby the<br>
losses become too small, the desired operating temperature cannot be<br>
maintained. Therefore, a practical low limit for the current density exists in the<br>
electrolysis mode and in the fuel cell mode. This current density limit depends<br>
on the thermal losses from the system and the heat generated at a specific<br>
current.<br>
Operation of a fuel cell at low current implies a fuel cell voltage close to<br>
the open circuit voltage (OCV), which is the fuel cell voltage at zero current.<br>
Operation below OCV implies power generation, while operation above OCV<br>
implies fuel regeneration/electrolysis. When the fuel cell is operated in the<br><br><br>
electrolysis mode, additional constraints on the minimum allowable current<br>
density can exist. In the example of water electrolysis at high temperature,<br>
operation of the fuel cell only slightly above OCV is an endothermic reaction.<br>
There is a minimum voltage for electrolysis, termed the thermal neutral voltage at<br>
which the electrolysis reaction is thermally neutral. In order to thermally sustain<br>
the SORFC without the use of thermal storage during electrolysis, electrolysis<br>
should be performed above the thermal neutral voltage. On the other hand,<br>
power generation can be performed very close to OCV. As a result the desired<br>
minimum current density for electrolysis is significantly larger than the desired<br>
minimum current for power generation in the fuel cell mode. The difference<br>
between the minimum currents depends on the thermal management system<br>
and the choice of fuel and oxidizer. In a SORFC without additional fuel<br>
generation, the current in power generation and electrolysis mode also should be<br>
balanced with respect to the available time for power generation and<br>
electrolysis. If, for example, energy is generated for 16 hours per day while fuel<br>
is regenerated for 8 hours per day, the current during regeneration has to be<br>
twice as large as the power generation current in order to balance fuel consumed<br>
and regenerated.<br>
The two constraints for current densities outlined above generally lead to<br>
different values for the minimum current density in the fuel cell and electrolysis<br>
modes. As a result of the higher current density in the electrolysis than in fuel<br>
cell mode, the energy storage system 120 typically has additional/unused fuel<br>
regeneration capacity. If additional or excess power or electrical energy and<br>
reactant product is available during fuel regeneration in the electrolysis mode,<br>
this excess fuel generation capacity can be utilized to generate additional fuel,<br>
which can be used outside the electrical energy storage system.<br>
Thus, the system 120 may be used as a regenerative power supply to<br>
remote residences or comnercial operations or to residences or commercial<br>
operations connected to the power grid. The electrical power generator has to<br><br><br>
be sized to meet the peak load of the user. This sizing requirement allows a<br>
surplus of fuel to be generated during charge times. Examples include, but are<br>
not limited to systems sized to meet high electrical power peak demands which<br>
occur during less than 100 percent of the system operation in the fuel cell mode<br>
or systems with relatively low energy consumption (i.e., below the maximum<br>
possible energy consumption) during the fuel cell mode.<br>
Thus, in one preferred aspect of the first embodiment, the reversible fuel<br>
system 190 is operated at a load lower than a peak load that the reversible fuel<br>
cell system is capable of providing at least during a portion of a time that the<br>
reversible fuel cell system operates in the fuel cell mode. Thus, the reversible<br>
fuel system 190 is operated for at least a portion of its fuel cell mode at a current<br>
density below its peak or maxirrum possible current density. In contrast, the<br>
reversible fuel system 190 is operated at a higher current density, such as at a<br>
peak current density, in the electrolysis mode to produce the excess fuel.<br>
Since the systems 120, 190 are designed and sized for a desired energy<br>
storage, the size of the fuel cell stack and the size of the balance of plant are<br>
based on the desired energy storage. Thus, the size of the fuel cell stack is<br>
based on the minimum number of fuel cells that operate in the fuel cell mode to<br>
provide the desired peak power, rather than on the number of fuel cells or<br>
electrolyzers that are required for the electrolysis mode. Thus, extra fuel cells or<br>
stacks may be required ensure that the system 120 provides the desired peak<br>
power in the fuel cell mode during a worst case scenario. However, the energy<br>
generation capability of all of the fuel cells may not be used in the fuel cell mode<br>
outside of the worst case scenario. In contrast, the fuel regeneration capability<br>
of all fuel cells may be used during electrolysis mode to regenerate the fuel<br>
needed for future fuel cell models) and to generate excess fuel for use outside<br>
the system 120.<br>
In another preferred aspect of the first embodiment, the reversible fuel<br><br><br>
cell system 190 is electrically connected to an electrical energy source 100 which<br>
comprises a photovoltaic energy generation system which provides electrical<br>
energy to the reversible fuel cell system during daytime to generate and store<br>
fuel. The photovoltaic energy generation system also provides electrical energy<br>
to the consumer 140, as illustrated in Figure 1. The reversible fuel cell system<br>
190 generates electrical energy during night time from the stored fuel and<br>
provides this electrical energy to the consumer 140 during night time. Often, the<br>
night time load on the reversible fuel cell system 190 is lower than a peak load<br>
that the reversible fuel cell system is capable of providing, at least during a<br>
portion of the night time period. Thus, the reversible fuel system 190 is operated<br>
in the fuel cell mode during at least a portion of the night time period at a current<br>
density below its peak current density. In contrast, the reversible fuel system<br>
190 is operated at a higher current density, such as at a peak current density, in<br>
the electrolysis mode during the day time period to produce the excess fuel.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, the reversible fuel cell system 190<br>
operates for a longer duration in the electrolysis mode than in the fuel cell mode<br>
over the predetermined number of cycles. This difference in operating time may<br>
be used to produce the excess fuel. For example, the system 190 may operate<br>
during one portion of the electrolysis mode to regenerate sufficient fuel for the<br>
entire next fuel cell mode period, and then operate for the remainder of the<br>
electrolysis mode period to produce the excess fuel.<br>
Examples of the second embodiment include system 190 operation where<br>
charging and discharging follows a day/night cycle. Such a system often<br>
operates with a photovoltaic electrical energy source 100 described above. If the<br>
night time discharge period is shorler than the day time charge period, a surplus<br>
or excess fuel can be generated.<br>
Another example is where the system 190 is used to provide emergency<br>
backup power when the electrical energy source 100 is unable to provide<br><br><br>
electrical energy to the consumer 140. For example, the system 190 may be<br>
used as a backup power source for a time when an electrical grid energy source<br>
100 stops providing electrical energy. In this example, the system 190 operates<br>
at least 90 to 99 percent of the time in the electrolysis mode and occasionally<br>
operates in the fuel cell mode when the source 100 does not provide electrical<br>
energy. Thus, the system 190 is used as an electrolyzer which provides fuel for<br>
non-system uses and as an emergency backup power generator. This mode of<br>
operation reduces the cost of the emergency backup energy generation system.<br>
If desired, the first and second embodiments may be combined, and the<br>
system 190 may operate in the electrolysis mode for a longer time period and at<br>
a higher current density than in the fuel cell mode.<br>
In a third preferred embodiment, the reversible fuel cell system 190 is<br>
electrically connected an electrical energy source 100 which comprises a<br>
renewable energy source. Any suitable renewable energy source may be used.<br>
An excess capacity of the renewable energy source is used to provide electrical<br>
energy to the reversible fuel cell operating in the electrolysis mode to generate<br>
the excess fuel. Different renewable energy sources have different types of<br>
excess capacities.<br>
In one example, the renewable energy source 100 may comprises a<br>
photovoltaic system, such as a solar cell array. The photovoltaic system<br>
contains extra capacity during a first portion, such as the first 95 to 99.9 percent,<br>
of its designed lifespan. In other vords, the capacity of the photovoltaic system<br>
decreases as the system ages during its life span. Thus, a photovoltaic system<br>
is often designed to provide a desired amount of electrical energy based on the<br>
remaining second portion of its expected lifespan, to prevent the photovoltaic<br>
system from providing an insufficient amount of electrical energy in the second<br>
portion of its expected life span, therefore, the photovoltaic system is designed<br>
and sized to provide electrical enegy in excess of that required by the consumer<br><br><br>
and that required by the reversible fuel cell system 190 to regenerate fuel for<br>
operation in the fuel cell mode. The excess capacity of the photovoltaic system<br>
during the first portion, such as the 95 to 99.9 percent, of its life span may be<br>
used to provide electrical energy to the reversible fuel cell system 190 to<br>
generate the excess fuel.<br>
In another example, the photovoltaic system 100 is designed and sized to<br>
provide a sufficient amount of electrical energy required by the consumer and<br>
required by the reversible fuel cell system 190 to regenerate fuel for operation in<br>
the fuel cell mode over a predetermined number of day and night cycles, even if<br>
a large amount of days are cloudy. In other words, the photovoltaic system 100<br>
is designed to provide a sufficient amount of electrical energy in a worst case<br>
weather scenario, such as when a predetermined percent, X, of day time periods<br>
are cloudy. However, the worst case weather scenario occurs occasionally.<br>
Thus, when less than X percent of day time periods are cloudy, and the system<br>
190 is fully recharged for operation in the next fuel cell mode period or periods,<br>
the photovoltaic system 100 may be used to provide electrical energy to system<br>
190 to generate excess fuel during the excess sunny portions of the day time<br>
periods. For example, the photovoltaic system 100 is designed and sized to<br>
provide a sufficient amount of electrical energy required by the consumer and<br>
required by the reversible fuel cell system 190 in the winter, when the number of<br>
sunny days is at a minimum and/or when the day length is shortest compared to<br>
the night length. Thus, there is no sufficient sunlight during X percent of the time<br>
during winter. The photovoltaic system 100 has excess capacity in the summer,<br>
when there is no sufficient sunlight during only X-Y percent of the time. The<br>
photovoltaic system 100 may be used to provide electrical energy to system 190<br>
to generate excess fuel during Y percent of the time during the summer.<br>
In another example, the renewable energy source 100 may comprise a<br>
wind turbine system which is designed to provide a minimum amount of electrical<br>
energy at a predetermined wind speed. Such systems often contain rotatable<br><br><br>
blades coupled to a generator which generates electricity when the wind rotates<br>
the blades. This system 100 contains extra capacity during periods when the<br>
wind speed exceeds a predetermined wind speed.<br>
The wind turbine system 100 is designed and sized to provide a sufficient<br>
amount of electrical energy required by the consumer and required by the<br>
reversible fuel cell system 190 to regenerate fuel for operation in the fuel cell<br>
mode over a predetermined number of cycles, even if a there is no wind or the<br>
wind speed is low during a large portion of a predetermined number of cycles. In<br>
other words, the system 100 is designed to provide a sufficient amount of<br>
electrical energy in a worst case weather scenario, such as when a<br>
predetermined percent, X, of the lime there is no wind or the wind speed is lower<br>
than desirable. However, the worst case weather scenario occurs occasionally.<br>
Thus, when less than X percent of the time period has little or no wind and the<br>
system 190 is fully recharged for operation in the next fuel cell mode period or<br>
periods, the system 100 may be used to provide electrical energy to system 190<br>
to generate excess fuel during the excess windy portions of the time period. For<br>
example, if X-Y percent of the time period has no wind or insufficient wind, then<br>
the system 100 may be used tc provide electrical energy to system 190 to<br>
generate excess fuel during Y percent of time period.<br>
In another example, the renewable energy source 100 may comprise a<br>
tidal energy generation system which is designed to provide a minimum amount<br>
of electrical energy at a predetermined tidal force. Such a system 100 contains<br>
movable members, such as plates, located under a body of water, such as a<br>
sea, ocean or lake. The movable members are connected to a generator. The<br>
movable members are moved by the tides and the movement causes the<br>
generator to generate electricity. This system contains extra capacity during<br>
periods when the tidal force exceeds the predetermined tidal force.<br>
The tidal energy generation system 100 is designed and sized to provide<br><br><br>
a sufficient amount of electrical energy required by the consumer and required<br>
by the reversible fuel cell system 190 to regenerate fuel for operation in the fuel<br>
cell mode over a predetermined number of cycles, even if a there is no tide or<br>
the tidal force is low during a large portion of a predetermined number of cycles.<br>
In other words, the system 100 is designed to provide a sufficient amount of<br>
electrical energy in a worst case tidal scenario, such as when a predetermined<br>
percent, X, of the time the tidal force is lower than desirable. However, the worst<br>
case tidal scenario occurs occasionally. Thus, when less than X percent of the<br>
time period has insufficient tidal force and the system 190 is fully recharged for<br>
operation in the next fuel cell mode period or periods, the system 100 may be<br>
used to provide electrical energy to system 190 to generate excess fuel during<br>
the excess high tidal force portions of the time period. For example, if X-Y<br>
percent of the time period has insufficient tidal force, then the system 100 may<br>
be used to provide electrical energy to system 190 to generate excess fuel<br>
during Y percent of time period.<br>
In another example, the enewable energy source 100 may comprise a<br>
geothermal energy generation system which is designed to provide a minimum<br>
amount of electrical energy at a predetermined geothermal energy. Such a<br>
system 100 uses the heat and/of steam emitted from the earth and converts the<br>
heat and/or steam into electrical energy. This system contains extra capacity<br>
during periods when the geothermal energy exceeds a predetermined, worst<br>
case thermal energy supply scenario. For example, ambient losses for the<br>
geothermal energy differ between warm summer ambient temperatures and cold<br>
winter ambient temperatures.<br>
Thus, as described above, co-production of fuel in an energy storage<br>
device using a fuel regenerating device can be realized in any situation where<br>
the fuel consumed during discharge is less than the fuel regenerated during<br>
charging periods, preferably over a predetermined number of charge and<br>
discharge cycles. The system 90 generates fuel during the entire electrolysis<br><br><br>
mode time period. From about to about 99 percent of the generated fuel, such<br>
as about 10 to about 30 percent of the generated fuel is excess fuel which may<br>
be used for non-system 120 uses, while the remaining fuel may be used to<br>
operate the system 190 in the fuel cell mode.<br>
It is preferred, but not recuired to use the system 120 with a renewable<br>
energy source 100 in remote locations that are not connected to the power grid.<br>
In this case, the reversible fuel cell system 190 of the electrical energy storage<br>
system 120 may be used to generate fuel for air, land or water vehicles. A<br>
vehicle fuel infrastructure is not required in this case and the system 120 may be<br>
used to supply the necessary fuel to power the vehicles at the remote location.<br>
For example, the vehicles may be powered by hydrogen, methane or other<br>
hydrocarbon fuel. Furthermore, since the system 190 may be used to generate<br>
electricity and an environmentally clean fuel, such as hydrogen, without emission<br>
of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide, the system 190 improves the<br>
environment and reduces the emission of greenhouse gases for transportation<br>
and other uses.<br>
The excess generated fuel may be used for any suitable application<br>
outside the system 120. For example, the excess fuel may be provided to power<br>
an airborne vehicle, such as a rocket, airplane, helicopter or blimp, a water<br>
based vehicle, such as a ship or submarine, a land based vehicle, such as a car,<br>
truck, motorcycle, tank or train, a chemical reaction in a chemical manufacturing<br>
process, such as a semiconductor manufacturing or chemical production<br>
process, or a heating system of a building, such as a commercial building,<br>
including office buildings, factories and hospitals and a residential building.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the equilibrium<br>
operating temperature of the reversible fuel cell system 190, such as a fuel cell<br>
stack, in the electrolysis mode is selected independently from the equilibrium<br>
operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in the fuel cell mode to optimize the<br><br><br>
amount and/or cost of the fuel produced in the electrolysis mode. Thus, in this<br>
embodiment, the equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in the<br>
electrolysis mode is preferably, but not necessarily different from the equilibrium<br>
operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in the fuel cell mode.<br>
In one preferred aspect, the equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel cell<br>
stack in the electrolysis mode may be selected to optimize or maximize the<br>
amount of fuel produced. In another preferred aspect, the equilibrium operating<br>
temperature of the fuel cell stack in the electrolysis mode may be selected to<br>
optimize or minimize the unit cost of the fuel produced. In this aspect, in certain<br>
situations, depending on different fuel cell stack design and operating variables,<br>
one or more minima may be observed on a curve of unit fuel cost versus amount<br>
of fuel produced. The equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in<br>
the electrolysis mode may be optimized to operate at or near one of the minima<br>
on this curve. In another preferred aspect, the equilibrium operating temperature<br>
of the fuel cell stack in the electrolysis mode is selected to maximize the amount<br>
of fuel produced during some time periods, such as during periods of high fuel<br>
demand or price, and at other time periods it is selected to minimize the fuel unit<br>
cost, such as during periods of low fuel price or demand. Thus, the equilibrium<br>
operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in the electrolysis mode may be<br>
higher or lower than that h the fuel cell mode depending on the desired<br>
optimized condition, such as fuel amount or fuel unit cost.<br>
Preferably, the equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel cell stack in<br>
the electrolysis mode is obtained by adjusting the current density provided to the<br>
fuel cell stack for a given reactant product flow rate. For example, the power<br>
management system 160 may be used to control the current density provided to<br>
the fuel cell stack (i.e., the reversible fuel cell system 190). As discussed above,<br>
the system 160 may be any suitable control system, such as a computer or<br>
microprocessor. Alternatively, the system 160 may comprise a manual current<br>
density control system, such as a manually rotated knob, lever, dial or one or<br><br><br>
more push buttons.<br>
Alternatively, the equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel cell stack<br>
may be adjusted by other methods. For example, the current density may be<br>
held constant while the reac:ant product flow rate may be adjusted manually or<br>
automatically by a controller, such as by a manual or automatic valve. If desired,<br>
both the current density and the reactant product flow rate may be adjusted to<br>
select the desired temperature.<br>
The selection of an optimum equilibrium operating temperature of the fuel<br>
cell stack in the electrolysis mode independent of the equilibrium operating<br>
temperature of the fuel cell stack in the fuel cell mode provides an operational<br>
advantage. As noted above, in order to thermally sustain the SORFC without the<br>
use of thermal storage during electrolysis, electrolysis should be performed<br>
above the thermal neutral voltage. Thus, the thermal losses keep the fuel cell<br>
stack at a desired temperature. If the fuel cell stack is used to generate fuel for<br>
use outside the system during electrolysis, the total amount of heat generated in<br>
the electrolysis mode is the same. However, some of the heat is used to<br>
generate the excess fuel rather than being lost, which reduces the thermal<br>
losses and provides an operational cost advantage for the fuel cell stack that is<br>
used to generate excess hydrogen.<br>
As discussed above, the reversible fuel cell system 190 may comprise any<br>
suitable system, such as a SORFC system, a PEM system or fuel<br>
cell/electrolyzer pairs and may be used with any suitable electrical energy source<br>
100 described above, such as a power grid or a renewable energy source. A<br>
SORFC stack is the preferred reversible fuel cell system 190.<br>
A single SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The SORFC contains an anode electrode 11, an electrolyte 13 and a cathode<br>
electrode 12. An anode gas chamber 14 is formed between the electrolyte 13<br><br><br>
and an anode side interconnect (not shown for simplicity). A cathode gas<br>
chamber 15 is formed between the electrolyte 13 and a cathode side<br>
interconnect (also not shown for simplicity).<br>
A reaction product gas mixture 17 may contain primarily water if hydrogen<br>
is used as a fuel. Alternatively, the reaction product gas mixture 17 may contain<br>
primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide if a carbon containing gas or liquid is<br>
used as a fuel. The reaction product gas mixture 17 is introduced into the<br>
cathode gas chamber 15. A direct current power source (not shown) is<br>
connected to the anode electrode 11 and the cathode electrode 12 in such a way<br>
that when electrical current is. flowing, the anode electrode 11 takes on a positive<br>
voltage charge and the cathode electrode 12 takes on a negative voltage<br>
charge. When the electric current is flowing, the gas mixture 17 gives up oxygen<br>
ions 16 to form cathode discharge mixture 19 consisting primarily of hydrogen<br>
and optionally carbon monoxide if mixture 17 contained carbon dioxide. Oxygen<br>
ions 16 transport across the electrolyte 13 under the electrical current. The<br>
oxygen ions 16 are converted into the oxidant, such as oxygen gas 18 on the<br>
anode electrode 11 under the influence of the electrical current. The oxygen gas<br>
18 is discharged from the anode chamber 14, while the electrolysis product (e.g.,<br>
hydrogen and optionally carbon monoxide) is collected from the cathode<br>
chamber.<br>
A single SORFC 20 operating in the fuel cell mode is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
SORFC 20 is the same as SORFC 10, except that the cathode and anode<br>
designations of its electrodes are reversed. Cathode electrode 21 is the same<br>
electrode as that identified as the anode electrode 11 in Fig. 4 when operating in<br>
the electrolysis mode. Anode electrode 22 is the same electrode as that<br>
identified as the cathode electrode 12 in Fig. 4 when operating in the electrolysis<br>
mode. Solid oxide electrolyte 23 is the same electrolyte as that identified as<br>
electrolyte 13 in Fig. 4 when operating in the electrolysis mode. Cathode gas<br>
chamber 24 is the same gas chamber as that identified as the anode gas<br><br><br>
chamber 14 in Fig. 4 when operating in the electrolysis mode. Anode gas<br>
chamber 25 is the same gas chamber as that identified as the cathode gas<br>
chamber 15 in Fig. 4 when operating in the electrolysis mode.<br>
A fuel gas 27 is introduced into the anode gas chamber 25. Oxygen gas<br>
28 is introduced into the cathode chamber 24. The fuel may comprise hydrogen,<br>
a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, and/or carbon monoxide. Water may be<br>
added to the fuel if desired. An electrical fuel cell load (not shown) is applied to<br>
the SORFC 20 and the oxygen gas 28 forms oxygen ions 26 under the influence<br>
of the electrical load. Oxygen ions 26 transport across the electrolyte 23 under<br>
the influence of the electrical current. On the anode electrode 22, the oxygen<br>
ions 26 combine with hydrogen and optionally carbon, if present, from gas<br>
mixture 27 to form gas mixture 29 containing water vapor and optionally carbon<br>
dioxide, if a carbon containing gas is present in the fuel 27. Gas mixture 29 is<br>
discharged from the anode chamber and stored as the reaction product. In the<br>
process described above, the SORFC 20 has made electrical energy or power,<br>
which is output through its electrodes.<br>
An optional Sabatier reactor subsystem 30 to be used when the fuel<br>
comprises methane is shown in Fig. 6. The reactor tube 31 contains a catalyst,<br>
such as a platinum family metal on an alumina support. Preferably, the catalyst<br>
comprises ruthenium. A gas mixture 32 consisting primarily of hydrogen and<br>
carbon monoxide is introduced into reactor tube 31 and contacts the catalyst<br>
therein. The gas mixture 32 undergoes an immediate exothermic reaction and<br>
produces gas mixture 33 consisting primarily of methane and water vapor. Gas<br>
mixture 33 is then discharged from the reactor tube 31. When the Sabatier<br>
reactor is used with the SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode, the<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide discharge mixture 19/32 is provided from the<br>
SORFC into the Sabatier reactor 30.<br>
Because the reaction within reactor tube 31 is highly exothermic, a heat<br><br><br>
exchanger 34 located in or adjacent to tube 31 is used to capture the generated<br>
heat. Gas mixture 35, consisting primarily of carbon dioxide and water, flows<br>
through heat exchanger 34 to absorb the exothermic reaction heat. When the<br>
Sabatier reactor is used with the SORFC 10 operating in the electrolysis mode,<br>
the water vapor and carbon dioxide inlet mixture 17/35 is heated in the Sabatier<br>
reactor by the reaction of the outlet or discharge mixture 19/32. The water vapor<br>
and carbon dioxide inlet mixture 17/35 is then provided from the Sabatier reactor<br>
into the SORFC 10.<br>
The SORFC system 50 of a preferred embodiment operating in a fuel cell<br>
mode is shown of Fig. 7 as a simplified schematic. The system 50 as shown<br>
operates with methane as a fuel. However, if desired, a hydrogen fuel may be<br>
used instead, as discussed above. A single SORFC 20 previously shown in Fig.<br>
5 as a cross section operatng in the fuel cell mode is shown again in Fig. 7.<br>
While a single SORFC is shown, it should be understood that the system 50<br>
contains a plurality of SORFC stacks. A hydrogen recovery unit 51 transfers<br>
hydrogen gas from within a first gas mixture stream into a second gas stream.<br>
The hydrogen recovery unit 51 can be a device which recovers hydrogen based<br>
on absorption/adsorption processes or based on an electrochemical proton<br>
exchange process. The electrochemical exchange process is preferred.<br>
An enthalpy recovery unit 52 transfers water vapor from first gas stream to<br>
a second gas stream. The enthalpy recovery unit 52 can be a device which<br>
transfers water vapor based on cyclic desiccant beds or a rotating desiccant<br>
wheel. The desiccant wheel (i.e., "enthalpy wheel") is preferred. An optional<br>
purge valve 53, such as a normally closed powered open solenoid valve may be<br>
used if pure oxygen is used. A heat exchanger 54 is a counter flow gas-gas heat<br>
exchanger. The SORFC power output, such as output electrode(s), is connected<br>
to a power distribution sys:em. The oxidizer (i.e., oxygen or air) enters the<br>
system 50 through the oxidizer inlet or conduit 55, while the fuel enters the<br>
system through the fuel inlet or conduit arrangement 56/57. The fuel exhaust<br><br><br>
exits through conduit arrangement 58/59.<br>
A method of operating the system 50 in the fuel cell mode is now<br>
described. Within the SORFC system 50 shown in Fig. 7, oxidizer, such as pure<br>
oxygen reactant gas from an oxygen storage vessel, such as a liquid oxygen<br>
tank, or air, is delivered to the cathode chamber of SORFC 20 through inlet<br>
conduit 55. If oxygen reactant is highly pure, then it is normally dead headed<br>
within the cathode chamber of SORFC 20. However, even the purest of gases<br>
will include trace non reactant gas species. As a result the cathode chamber of<br>
SORFC 20 should be occasionally purged of these non reactant species.<br>
Oxygen purge valve 53 is used to accomplish this purging.<br>
High purity hydrocarbon inlet stream, such as a methane stream, is<br>
introduced into the SORFC system 50 from a hydrocarbon storage vessel, such<br>
as a tank (not shown for clarity), through conduit 56 into the hydrogen recovery<br>
unit 51. As noted above, a hydrogen fuel inlet stream may be used instead.<br>
Within the hydrogen recovery unit 51, hydrogen gas is transferred from the fuel<br>
exhaust outlet stream in conduit 58 into the methane stream. This hydrogen<br>
supports a uniform methane reformation process within the anode chamber of<br>
SORFC 20. The methane and hydrogen mixture next is introduced into the<br>
enthalpy recovery unit 52, where a portion of the water vapor is transferred from<br>
the fuel exhaust outlet stream in conduit 58 into the methane and hydrogen inlet<br>
stream. Preferably, the enthaipy recovery unit also transfers heat from the outlet<br>
stream to the inlet stream. From the enthalpy recovery unit 52, the methane,<br>
hydrogen and water vapor mixture is introduced into the heat exchanger 54,<br>
where the gas mixture temperature is increased near to the operational<br>
temperature of 600C to 1000C using the high temperature waste heat from the<br>
outlet stream in conduit 58 From heat exchanger 54, the hot mixture of<br>
methane, hydrogen, and water vapor is delivered to the anode chamber of<br>
SORFC 20 through conduit 157. Some steam reformation of the methane will<br>
occur in the heat exchanger 54 and conduit 57 but the amount is suppressed by<br><br><br>
the existence of the hydrogen The completion of the steam reforming of the<br>
methane is accomplished in the anode chamber of the SORFC 20.<br>
Within the anode chamber of the SORFC 20, the steam reforming of<br>
methane and the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in the fuel cell reactions<br>
converts the discharged gas mixture (i.e., fuel exhaust) in conduit 58 to carbon<br>
dioxide, additional water vapor and excess hydrogen. If hydrogen rather than<br>
methane is used as a fuel, ther no carbon dioxide is produced. The discharged<br>
gas mixture in conduit 58 passes through heat exchanger 54, releasing waste<br>
heat, and then through the enthalpy recovery unit 52 to supply a portion of the<br>
water vapor to support the input methane reformation. The discharged gas<br>
mixture in conduit 58 is then directed to the hydrogen recovery unit 51 where<br>
virtually all but trace quantities of the hydrogen is transferred to the inlet fuel<br>
stream. Using the preferred electrochemical proton exchange process as the<br>
hydrogen recovery unit 51, provides an exact measure of the hydrogen content<br>
within the discharged gas mixture in conduit 58 which is used to adjust the input<br>
methane flow rate. The outlet mixture in conduit 59 from hydrogen recovery unit<br>
51 contains only carbon dioxide and water which are stored separately (not<br>
shown).<br>
The SORFC system 6C of a preferred embodiment operating in an<br>
electrolysis mode is shown of Fig. 8 as a simplified schematic. A single SORFC<br>
10 previously shown in Fig. 4 as a cross section operating in the electrolysis<br>
mode is shown again in Fig. 8. The hydrogen recovery unit 51 transfers<br>
hydrogen gas from within a first gas mixture stream into a second gas stream.<br>
The hydrogen recovery unit 51 can be a device which recovers hydrogen based<br>
on absorption/adsorption processes or based on an electrochemical proton<br>
exchange process. The electrochemical exchange process is preferred.<br>
If methane is used as a fuel, then the system 60 also includes the<br>
Sabatier reactor subsystem 30, described with respect to Fig. 6, which converts<br><br><br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen into methane and water vapor. If methane is<br>
used as a fuel, then the reactant product comprising carbon dioxide and water<br>
enter the system 60 through inlet or conduit 61, which may be the same or<br>
different than conduit 56, shown in Fig. 7. If hydrogen is used as a fuel, then<br>
water is used as a reactant product. The generated oxygen exits through outlet<br>
or conduit 65, while the methane and water exit through outlet or conduit<br>
arrangement 63/64. Conduits 63/64 and 65, respectively, may be the same or<br>
different conduits as conduits 38/59 and 55, respectively, shown in Fig. 7.<br>
Thus, the system 60 operating in the electrolysis mode is the same<br>
system as system 50 operating in the fuel cell mode, except that the inlet and<br>
outlet streams are steered through the optional Sabatier reactor subsystem 30<br>
instead of through the heat exchanger 54 and the enthalpy recovery unit 52,<br>
which remains inactive in the electrolysis mode. The inlet and outlet streams<br>
may be steered using valves and parallel conduits (not shown for clarity).<br>
Furthermore, the electrode designations in the SORFC 10 of system 60 are<br>
reversed compared to SORFC 20 of system 50, as explained in detail with<br>
respect to Figs. 1 and 2 above.<br>
A method of operating the system 60 in the electrolysis mode is now<br>
described. If methane is used as a fuel, then carbon dioxide and water are<br>
introduced into the SORFC system 60 through conduit 61 into hydrogen recovery<br>
unit 51. Carbon dioxide may the introduced from a carbon dioxide storage vessel<br>
or from a conduit. If hydrogen is used as a fuel, then the carbon dioxide is<br>
omitted. Within the hydrogen recovery unit 51, hydrogen gas is transferred from<br>
the outlet stream in conduit 63 into the carbon dioxide and water inlet stream.<br>
This extra hydrogen eventually assures that all the carbon bearing gases are<br>
converted into methane within the Sabatier reactor subsystem 30. The carbon<br>
dioxide, water, and hydrogen inlet mixture next is introduced into the Sabatier<br>
subsystem 30 heat exchanger where it is heated by the exothermic reaction.<br>
From the Sabatier subsystem 30, the carbon dioxide, hydrogen and water vapor<br><br><br>
mixture is delivered to the cathode chamber of SORFC 10 through conduit 62.<br>
Within the cathode chamber of SORFC 10, the carbon dioxide and water vapor<br>
are reduced by electrolysis 1o carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Excess water<br>
and some unreacted carbon dioxide will be discharged from the cathode<br>
chamber of SORFC 10 along with the carbon monoxide and hydrogen through<br>
conduit 63.<br>
The discharged gas mixture in conduit 63 passes through the Sabatier<br>
subsystem 30 to convert all the carbon oxides to methane and water with the<br>
excess hydrogen. If hydrogen is used as a fuel, then the Sabatier subsystem 30<br>
is omitted and the discharged water vapor comprises the reactant product. The<br>
discharged gas mixture in conduit 63 is then directed to the hydrogen recovery<br>
unit 51 wherein virtually all but trace quantities of the hydrogen is transferred to<br>
the inlet carbon dioxide and water stream. Using the preferred electrochemical<br>
proton exchange process as the hydrogen recovery unit 51, provides an exact<br>
measure of the hydrogen content within the discharged gas mixture in conduit 63<br>
which is used to adjust the input carbon dioxide flow rate. The outlet mixture in<br>
conduit 64 from hydrogen recovery unit 51 contains only methane and water<br>
which are stored separately (not shown). If desired, the water may be<br>
discharged and fresh water from a water pipe may be used for the SORFC<br>
reactions.<br>
In the meantime, pure oxygen gas is generated in the SORFC 10 anode<br>
during the electrolysis process. The oxygen is discharged from the SORFC 10<br>
anode through conduit 65 and on to discharge, direct metabolic use and/or to<br>
liquefied storage (not shown).<br>
The Sabatier reactor which generates methane is advantageous because<br>
it operates at a temperature of about 400-900 °C degrees, which is a suitable<br>
temperature for heating the inlet stream being provided into the SORFC to or<br>
near to a desired SORFC operating temperature. However, other reactors which<br><br><br>
generate hydrocarbon gases other than methane may be used instead of the<br>
Sabatier reactor.<br>
For example, reactors which convert an exhaust gas which contains<br>
hydrogen and carbon oxides such as carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide,<br>
and optionally water, to methanol may be used instead. The methanol reactors<br>
typically, but not necessarily, contain a copper catalyst which converts hydrogen,<br>
carbon oxides and/or water vapor to methanol. These reactors may be catalyst<br>
bed type reactors, such as ARC reactors, quench converters, tube cooled<br>
converters, isothermal reactors where a continuous catalyst bed surrounds a<br>
spiral wound heat exchanger, and other suitable reactor types.<br>
The following exothermic reactions are involved in the synthesis of<br>
methanol: CO + 2H2 = CH3OH; CO2 + 3H2 = CH3OH and CO + H2O = CO2 +<br>
H2. The use of a SORFC operating in the electrolysis mode to generate<br>
methanol is advantageous because the SORFC exhaust gas contains a similar<br>
composition to synthesis gas that is used as a source gas for methanol<br>
production. The synthesis gas is usually specially prepared in a separate<br>
catalytic steam reforming of natural gas in conventional methanol synthesis<br>
process.<br>
If desired, additional reactors may be present downstream of the Sabatier<br>
or methanol reactors to further purify the methane or methanol if desired.<br>
Alternatively, the additional reactors may be used to convert methane or<br>
methanol to other hydrocarbon gases, such as ethane, propane, octane, formic<br>
acid, formaldehyde and/or other suitable hydrocarbon gases. These<br>
hydrocarbon gases may be used as a fuel for the SORFC in the fuel cell mode<br>
and/or may be removed from the SORFC system for other use, sale or storage.<br>
Thus, the SORFC system may be used to generate various hydrocarbon fuels<br>
for storage or sale when the system is not generating power in the fuel cell<br>
mode. Alternatively, suitable reactors may be used to convert the hydrogen and<br><br><br>
carbon oxide containing SORFC electrolysis mode exhaust to the other<br>
hydrocarbon gases, such as ethane, propane, octane, formic acid, formaldehyde<br>
and/or other suitable hydrocarbon gases.<br>
The SORFC systems described herein may have other embodiments and<br>
configurations, as desired. Other components, such as fuel side exhaust stream<br>
condensers, heat exchangers, heat-driven heat pumps, turbines, additional gas<br>
separation devices, hydrogen separators which separate hydrogen from the fuel<br>
exhaust and provide hydrogen for external use, fuel preprocessing subsystems,<br>
fuel reformers and/or water-gas shift reactors, may be added if desired, as<br>
described, for example, in L.S. Application Serial Number 10/300,021, filed on<br>
November 20, 2002 (corresponding to Indian Patent Application No. 1093/<br>
KOLNP/2004), in U.S. Provsional Application Serial Number 60/461,190, filed<br>
