DESCRIPTION<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a novel method of manufacturing a silylalkoxymethyl<br>
halide, the product being obtained easily and with a high yield.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Silylalkoxymethyl halides are publicly known. Among these compounds,<br>
trimethylsilylmethoxymethyl chloride and phenyldimethylsilylmethoxymethyl chloride in<br>
particular are very important in the synthesis of bio-active substances and natural products<br>
with complex structures as reagents that protect functional groups containing active hydrogen.<br>
[0003] Some examples of synthesis by several methods have already been reported for<br>
silylalkoxymethyl chlorides such as trimethylsilylmethoxymethyl chloride and<br>
phenyldimethylsilylmethoxymethyl chloride (See to Bruce H. Lipshutz et al., Tetrahedron<br>
Letters (Great Britain), Volume 21 (1980), pp. 3343-3346; Denis Guedin-Vunong et al.,<br>
Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France (France), No. 2 (1986), pp. 245-252; Arthur G.<br>
Schultz et al., Organic Preparations and Procedures International (US), Volume 27 (1995),<br>
pp. 572-574; and G. J. P. H. Boons et al., Tetrahedron Letters (Great Britain), Volume 31<br>
(1990), pp. 2197-2200). These synthesis examples involve chloromethylation of the<br>
corresponding silyl alcohol using hydrogen chloride gas in the presence of a formaldehyde<br>
polymer.<br>
[0004] However, there is a substantial problem to execute this procedure on an industrial<br>
basis. Specifically, the generation of by-product water cannot be avoided during<br>
chloromethylation using hydrogen chloride gas, and this water reacts with the product,<br>
resulting in product decomposition. The result is either a major reduction in the yield of the<br>
target silylalkoxymethyl chloride or a complete failure to obtain the target silylalkoxymethyl<br>
chloride.<br>
[0005] In the aforementioned references, the by-product water is removed from the<br>
system by introducing a dehydrating agent, such as magnesium sulfate, immediately after the<br><br>
reaction. However, the implementation of this procedure on an industrial basis is<br>
cumbersome and complicated, and the product decomposition also proceeds during the time<br>
required to carry out the dehydration treatment. Moreover, the dehydrating agent must be<br>
separated from the product by, for example, filtration, which lengthens the process time,<br>
increases the amount of waste, raises the production costs, and lowers the yield.<br>
[0006] In addition to the preceding, hydrogen chloride gas is a gaseous reagent and thus<br>
is much more difficult to handle than ordinary liquid reagents. It is difficult, in particular, to<br>
measure the amount used in the reaction, making it necessary to use a large excess of the gas<br>
and thereby raising the costs and increasing the amount of waste.<br>
[0007] A. G. Shipov et al., Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii (formerly the USSR), Volume 59<br>
(1989), pp. 1204-1205, describes a method for manufacturing alkoxymethyl chloride by the<br>
reaction of an aryl alcohol or alkyl alcohol with formula (3)<br>
R-OH (3)<br>
wherein R is phenylmethyl or an alkyl group having 1, 5, 8, 10 or 12 carbon atoms, with<br>
paraformaldehyde in chlorotrimethylsilane. However, this reference does neither describe nor<br>
suggest the use of a silyl alcohol as a starting material.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0009] This invention solves the problems noted above, and its object is the introduction<br>
of a high yield method of manufacturing silylalkoxymethyl halide. The method does not<br>
require the use of difficult-to-handle hydrogen chloride gas, it does not generate by-product<br>
water, it does not require a dehydrating agent, it generates little solid waste, and it requires<br>
less time for manufacturing silylalkoxymethyl halide than current methods.<br>
[0010] As a result, in accordance with the invention, it has been discovered that a<br>
silylalkoxymethyl halide represented by formula (1):<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl group, or a halogen atom, R4 is divalent<br>
hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and X is a halogen atom, could be<br>
synthesized at good efficiencies by reacting<br>
(a)	a silyl alcohol compound represented by formula (2):<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or a halogen atom, and R4 is divalent<br>
hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, with<br>
(b)	formaldehyde or a polymer thereof, and<br>
(c)	a halosilane.<br>
It was also discovered that high purity silylalkoxymethyl halide could be obtained in high<br>
yields by distilling out, under the application of reduced pressure, hydrogen halide generated<br>
as a by-product in the reaction, excess halosilane, and the reaction product of water and<br>
halosilane; and thereafter adding<br>
(d)	a tertiary amine, and<br>
distilling the silylalkoxymethyl halide.<br>
[0011] The method of the invention enables a high yield and industrially facile and<br>
efficient synthesis of a silylalkoxymethyl halide represented by formula (1):<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or a halogen atom, R4 is divalent<br>
hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and X is a halogen atom, without using<br>
either hydrogen chloride gas or a dehydrating agent, and it does so while making it possible<br>
to reduce the amount of solid waste.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0012] According to the method, the (a) silyl alcohol compound represented by formula<br>
(2):<br><br>
is the primary starting material. R1, R2, and R3 in formula (2) are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or a<br>
halogen atom, while R4 is a divalent hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. R1, R2,<br>
and R3 can be specifically exemplified by alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, and isohexyl; cycloalkyl groups such as<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl; aryl groups such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, and<br>
naphthyl; and halogen atoms such as the chlorine atom and fluorine atom. R4 is specifically<br>
exemplified by methylene; alkylene having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as ethylene, propylene,<br>
and butylene; cycloalkylene having 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as cyclopentylene and<br>
cyclohexylene; and arylene having 6 to 10 carbon atoms such as phenylene and naphthylene.<br>
When the compound represented by formula (1) prepared in accordance with the invention is<br>
used as a reagent for protecting active hydrogen-containing functional groups, R', R2, and<br>
R3 are preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, or phenyl, and R4 preferably is methylene,<br>
ethylene, or propylene, and more preferably ethylene. The silyl alcohol compound<br>
represented by formula (2) can be specifically exemplified by trimethylsilylmethanol, 2-<br>
trimethylsilylethanol, 3-trimethylsilylpropanol, 2-triethylsilylethanol, 2-<br>
triisopropylsilylethanol, and 2-dimethylphenylsiIylethanol. These silyl alcohol compounds<br>
can in some cases be acquired as reagents, and when necessary can also be synthesized by<br>
known procedures.<br>
[0013] The (b) formaldehyde or polymer thereof is a generally known formaldehyde<br>
equivalent. Usable here are, inter alia, gaseous formaldehyde, trioxane (the trimer), and<br>
paraformaldehyde (a polymer). Granular paraformaldehyde is particularly preferred from the<br>
standpoints of reactivity and ease of handling. Aqueous formalin solutions are undesirable<br>
due to the negative effects exercised by their water fraction. The formaldehyde or polymer<br><br>
thereof may be used in a small excess, and preferably in the range of 1 to 1.5 equivalents,<br>
with respect to the (a) silyl alcohol compound with formula (2).<br>
[0014] The (c) halosilane functions to react with the silyl alcohol compound and thereby<br>
produces the hydrogen halide required by the halomethylation reaction, and at the same time<br>
functions to scavenge the water generated as a by-product. When the compound represented<br>
by formula (1) prepared in accordance with the invention is used as a reagent for protecting<br>
active hydrogen-containing functional groups, the halosilane is preferably a chlorosilane or a<br>
bromosilane, and more preferably is a chlorosilane. Specific examples are tetrachlorosilane,<br>
methyltrichlorosilane, chlorotrimethylsilane, and chlorotriethylsilane. Chlorotrimethylsilane<br>
is most preferred when one considers its ease of acquisition and ease of separation of the<br>
product after water scavenging. The (c) halosilane is desirably used in excess relative to the<br>
(a)	silyl alcohol compound represented by formula (2), wherein 2 to 20 equivalents is<br>
preferred, and 3 to 5 equivalents is more preferred, in each case referred to the (a) silyl<br>
alcohol compound represented by formula (2).<br>
[0015] The reaction among the (a) silyl alcohol compound represented by formula (2),<br>
(b)	formaldehyde or polymer thereof, and the (c) halosilane proceeds readily merely upon<br>
mixing the individual components. However, a procedure in which one component is added<br>
dropwise to a mixture of the other components is desirable, in order to avoid an overly<br>
vigorous reaction. More preferably, the reaction is appropriately carried out by adding the (a)<br>
silyl alcohol compound represented by formula (2) dropwise to a mixture of (b)<br>
formaldehyde or polymer thereof, and the (c) halosilane. The reaction temperature is<br>
preferably low, in order to avoid product decomposition and the range of 0 to 10°C is most<br>
preferred. The reaction does not require solvent, but a solvent inert with respect to the<br>
individual components such as toluene, xylene, and heptane can be used when necessary.<br>
[0016] The target material is obtained after the reaction by distilling out, under the<br>
application of reduced pressure, the hydrogen halide, excess halosilane, and water/halosilane<br>
reaction product. Purification by distillation is desirably carried out in order to provide an<br>
additional increase in target material purity. Improvements in the silylalkoxymethyl halide<br>
purity and reaction yield can be obtained by the addition of (d) tertiary amine to this<br><br>
distillative purification, in order to neutralize the hydrogen halide not completely distilled out<br>
under reduced pressure, and thereby more effectively inhibit product decomposition. This<br>
tertiary amine is preferably triethanolamine or diisopropylethylamine, and is more preferably<br>
diisopropylethylamine.<br>
[0017] Silylalkoxymethyl halide represented by formula (1) prepared by the method in<br>
accordance with the invention can be exemplified by (trimethylsilyl)methoxyethyl chloride,<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride, 3-(trimethylsilyl)propoxymethyl chloride, 2-<br>
(triethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride, 2-(triisopropylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride, and 2-<br>
(dimethylphenylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride.<br>
Examples<br>
[0018] The invention is described by the examples provided below, but the invention is<br>
not limited to these examples. In these examples, the gas chromatograms and mass spectra of<br>
the reaction products were measured using a GCMS-QP5050A (Shimadzu Corporation). The<br>
reaction product was identified by agreement between the measurement results obtained for<br>
the reaction product using the GCMS-QP5050A, and the measurement results for a<br>
commercially acquired 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride reference material (from<br>
Tokyo Kasei). The purity of the purified 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride was<br>
calculated from the results of gas chromatographic measurement (GCMS-QP5050A) of the<br>
reference material and reaction product by comparing the respective peak area ratios.<br>
[0019] Practical Example 1<br>
13.5 g (0.45 mol) of paraformaldehyde and 125.0 g (1.15 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane were<br>
introduced into a 300-mL four-neck flask fitted with a thermometer and stirrer. 54.4 g (0.46<br>
mol) of 2-trimethylsilylethanol was added dropwise over 30 minutes while stirring and<br>
cooling with an ice bath. After wanning the reaction mixture to room temperature, the<br>
pressure was reduced to 100 mmHg using an aspirator, and the hydrogen chloride was<br>
removed. The low boiling fraction was distilled off, and additional vacuum distillation was<br>
carried out to provide 34.0 g of 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride. The<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride product had a purity of 76%, and the yield was 33%.<br><br>
[0020] Comparative Example 1<br>
6.0 g (0.2 mol) of paraformaldehyde and 23.7 g (0.2 mol) of 2-trimethylsilylethanol were<br>
introduced into a 100-mL four-neck flask fitted with a thermometer and stirrer. Hydrogen<br>
chloride gas was bubbled in while stirring and cooling with an ice bath, but the end point of<br>
the reaction was unclear. While the production of 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride<br>
while on the ice bath was confirmed, the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxyrnethyl chloride produced<br>
underwent decomposition when the mixture was warmed to room temperature, and no target<br>
material whatever was obtained.<br>
[0021] Practical Example 2<br>
6.0 g (0.2 mol) of paraformaldehyde and 108.6 g (1 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane were<br>
introduced into a 200-mL four-neck flask fitted with a thermometer and stirrer. 23.7 g (0.2<br>
mol) of 2-trimethylsilylethanol was added dropwise over 30 minutes while stirring and<br>
cooling with an ice bath. After warming the reaction mixture to room temperature, the<br>
pressure was reduced to 100 mm Hg using an aspirator, and the hydrogen chloride was<br>
removed. After then adding 5 drops of diisopropylethylamine, the low boiling fraction was<br>
distilled off, and additional vacuum distillation was carried out to provide 22.9 g of<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride. The purity of the obtained<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride was very high, i.e., 98%, and the yield was 68%.<br>
[0022] Practical Example 3<br>
A reaction was carried out under the same conditions as in Practical Example 2, but using<br>
36.1 g (0.2 mol) of 2-dimethylphenylsilylethanol in place of the 2-trimethylsilylethanol. 33.4<br>
g of 2-(dirnethylphenylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride was obtained. The purity of the<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride was very high, i.e., 99%, and the yield was 73%.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
