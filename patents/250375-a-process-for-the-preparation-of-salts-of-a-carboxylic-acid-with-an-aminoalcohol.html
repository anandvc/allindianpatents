				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention refers to a process for the preparation of salts of a carboxylic acid with an aminoalcohol i.e. enantiomerically pure l-substituted-3-aminoalcohols, particularly of (5)-( )- and (R)-(+)-3-N-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol, which can be obtained by asymmetrically hydrogenating salts of the corresponding aminoketones and a carboxylic acid, particularly of 3-N-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanone and a carboxylic acid, in the presence of a catalyst comprising a transition metal and a diphosphine ligand.<br>
(S)-( )-3-N-Methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol is an intermediate for the preparation of (S)-(+)-methyl-[3-(l-naphthyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)-propyl]-amine (duloxetine), an agent for the treatment of depression and urinary incontinence (Huiling et al. Chirality 2000, 12, 26-29, Sorbera et al. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(9), 907-916).<br>
Several processes for racemic (WO2004/005239) and asymmetric (Sorbera et al. below) hydrogenation of thienyl aminoketone are known, as well as processes for chiral resolution of the resulting 3-iV-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol (WO-A 2004/005220, WO-A 2004/005307). Furthermore, processes for direct asymmetric hydrogenation using transition metal-ligand complexes are disclosed in EP-A 0 647 648, EP-A 0 926 152, EP-A 0 945 457, EP-A 0 955 303 and WO-A 02/40492.<br>
Huiling et al. describe a preparation of (S)-( )-3-N-methylamino-l -(2-thienyl)- 1-propanol from thiophene. Thiophene is converted with 3-chloropropanoyl chloride in the presence of tin tetrachloride in benzene to 3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanone, which is reduced with sodium borohydride in ethanol to 3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol. Kinetic resolution by transesterification using vinyl butanoate and lipase B from Candida antarctica as catalyst in hexane yielded (S)-3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)- 1-propanol, which is converted to (S)-3-iodo-l-(2-thienyl)-1-propanol using sodium iodide in acetone. Subsequent treatment with methylamine in tetrahydrofuran afforded (S)-( )-3-N-methylamino-l -(2-thienyl)-1 -propanol.<br>
Sorbera et al. describe another preparation of (S)-( )-3-N-methylamino-l -(2-thienyl)-1-propanol from thiophene, which is essentially the same as the one described by Huiling et al. except that 3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanone is asymmetrically reduced to (5)-3-chloro-<br>
l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol using borane and catalytic amounts of (/?)-3,3-diphenyl-l-methyltetrahydro-3//-pyrrolo[l,2-c][l,3,2]oxazaborole in THF. This asymmetric reduction afforded (5)-3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol in a yield of 86% from 3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-1-propanone (Wheeler et al. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 1995, 36, 213-223).<br>
The drawbacks of the preparations of (£)-( )-3-N-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol above, are the use of toxic or carcinogenic compounds such as tin tetrachloride and benzene and/or the use of expensive compounds such as borane or sodium iodide, the latter being in addition difficult to dispose of. The disclosed asymmetric hydrogenation processes with diphosphines are not satisfying in regard of the hydrogenation of 3-jV-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-1 -propanone.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an ecological and economical process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure l-substituted-3-aminoalcohols, particularly of (S)-( )- and (^)-(+)-3-W-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol. It is another object of the present invention to provide new salts of 3-//-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanone and organic acids.<br>
These objects are achieved by the process of claim 1.<br>
Provided is a process for the preparation of salts of a carboxylic acid with an aminoalcohol of the formula<br>
(Figure Removed) wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of 2-thienyl, 2-furanyl and phenyl, each optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms and/or one or more Ci-4-alkyl or Ci-4-alkoxy groups, and wherein R2 is Ci-4-alkyl or phenyl, each optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms and/or one or more Ci-4-alkyl or Ci-4-alkoxy groups, comprising asymmetrically hydrogenating a salt of a carboxylic acid with an aminoketone of the formula<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, in the presence of a transition metal complex of a diphosphine ligand.<br>
In Sakuraba et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1995, 43, 748-753, and JP-A 50-70412 the asymmetric hydrogenation of HC1 salts of 3-A-methylamino-l-phenyl-l-propanol and 3-amino-l-phenyl-1-propanone is disclosed. EP-A-457559 discloses the preparation of HC1 salts of 3-dimethyl-amino-1 -(2-thienyl)-1 -propanone and (S)-(-)-Af,7V-dimethyl-3 -(2-thienyl)-3 -hydroxypropane-amine as well as the oxalate salts of (5)-(+)-A^,A^dimethyl-3-(l-napthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)-propanamine and (.S)-(-)-AV-dimethyl-3-(l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propananiine. The latter two ones being aromatic ethers of the compounds of formula I. Direct preparation of the respective organic acid salts is not disclosed in the prior art. Surprisingly, these compounds can be used in the hydrogenation reaction as well without increasing the amount of by-products. Using organic acids is favourable, since they are less acidic than HC1 and therefore the risk of decomposition while concentrating during recovery of the products is reduced. The compounds obtainable by the present process can be used directly without exchange of the anion.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the diphosphine ligand is<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Asymmetric hydrogenation of l-substituted-3-7V-alkylamino-l-propanone hydrochlorides with diphosphine-transition metal complexes is not possible without generating the free amines by neutralizing the acidic salts. Due to the fact that the free l-substituted-3-./V-alkylamino-1-propanones tend to decompose, the resulting l-substituted-3-A/-alkylamino-l-propanols are contaminated with by-products. Exchanging the hydrochloric acid with a carboxylic acid allows<br>
direct hydrogenation of the resulting, optionally purified, salt of a l-substituted-3-./V-alkylmino-1-propanone in high yields, high purity and high enantiomeric excess (ee). Avoiding decomposition of the free aminoketone in the presence of base is another advantageous feature of the present invention.<br>

Particularly preferred carboxylic acids are monocarboxylic acids.

The present invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 3-Af-methylammo-l-(2-thienyI)-l-propanone hydrochloride (PRON-HCI)<br>
A mixture of 2-acetylthiophene (25.5 g, 200 mmol), methylamine hydrochloride (14.9 g, 220 mmol), paraformaldehyde (8.2 g, 280 mmol) and ethanol (100 mL) is heated in an autoclave at 120 to 130 °C for 9 h. The obtained light brown solution is cooled to 20 °C and part of the ethanol (50 mL) is removed by distillation in vacuo. Ethyl acetate (200 mL) is added to the residue to afford a thick suspension, which is cooled to 0 °C and kept for 45 min at that temperature. The obtained precipitate is isolated by filtration and dried, yielding 29.3 g 3-W-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanone hydrochloride (PRON-HCI, 71%) as a slightly yellow powder.<br>
Comparative example 1: Preparation of racemic 3-Ar-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol (PROL-HC1)<br>
Sodium hydroxide (4.0 g of a 50% aqueous solution) is added to a mixture of PRON-HCI (10.3 g, 50 mmol) and ethanol (35 mL) at 4 °C in about 5 min. Neat sodium borohydride (0.95 g, 25 mmol) is added in several portions in about 30 min to afford a beige suspension which is stirred at 4 °C for additional 4 h. Acetone (10 mL) is added dropwise in 5 min and the mixture is stirred for additional 10 min before water (20 mL) is added. The mixture is concentrated about 5 times in vacuo and the obtained residue is extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) (2x20 mL). The collected organic phases are concentrated in vacuo affording 7.2 g racemic 3-W-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol (PROL-HC1 84%) as an orange oil which crystallizes spontaneously after a few h. 'H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz): 7.35 (1 H, dd, J = 4.8, 1.0), 6.94 (1 H, dd, J = 4.8, 3.6), 6.90 (1 H, dd, J = 3.6, 1.0), 4.90 (1 H, t), 3.7 (2 H, m), 2.56 (2 H, m), 2.25 (3 H, s), 1.79 (2 H, q); 13C-NMR (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz): 150.9, 126.3, 123.7, 122.3, 67.8, 48.5, 38.7, 36.0.<br>

syringe. The autoclave is then closed and purged several times with nitrogen, heated up to 50 °C, then hydrogen is added until the pressure reaches 30 bar. After 5 h at that temperature under stirring, the autoclave is cooled to room temperature. Once cold, the clear yellow-brownish solution is transferred into a 50 mL round bottom flask and concentrated to dryness affording a beige solid (0.23 g, 92%, ee: about 97% by HPLC).<br>

Example 3: Preparation of PRON-diketegulac<br>
A sticky suspension of 675 g (2.13 mol) PRON-HCI in 5.5 L MTBE and 0.9 L water is stirred at a temperature of 0 to 5 °C in a 10 L vessel. Within 0.5 h 576 g (2.88 mol) of a 20% NaOH-solution are added and the reaction mixture is stirred for another 30 min at the same<br>
temperature. After phase separation and washing of the organic phase with water (1.3 L) and extracting the aqueous phase with MTBE (2x1.3 L), the combined organic layers are cooled in a 10 L vessel to below 10 °C. After addition of a solution of 590 g (-)-DAG (2.02 mol) within 15 min a yellowish mixture is obtained and crystallization occurs spontaneously or after addition of a crystallization aid, such as a small crystal of the product.

A suspension of 738 g of the product of example 3, 5.3 L MTBE and 2.7 L methanol are heated under reflux. After addition of further 1.8 L methanol at the same temperature a clear yellowish solution is obtained. During cooling to 0 to 5 °C within 3 h, the product precipitates. After further stirring at 0 to 5 °C for 2 h, filtration, washing with MTBE (21 L) and drying in vacuo at 50 to 55 °C, the product (538 g of white solid) is obtained.<br>
