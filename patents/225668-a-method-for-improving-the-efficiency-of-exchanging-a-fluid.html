				<td>RAPID AEROGEL PRODUCTION PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an improved method for preparing an<br>
aerogel product, e.g. bead, composite or monolith, in which the time required to<br>
perform solvent exchange and drying, is substantially reduced.<br>
Aerogel products, after wet gel formation, are conventionally prepared by a<br>
process of liquid CO2 extraction of whatever solvent(s) is utilized to form the wet<br>
gels followed by a supercritical CO2 extraction. More particularly, a sol-gel<br>
technique is used to prepare wet gels in a solvent such as ethanol or ethyl acetate.<br>
The wet gels are placed into a suitable mold and then aged, commonly overnight. As<br>
practiced by the assignee of this application in making sample quantities of aerogel<br>
products, and as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,805 to Coronado et<br>
al., the solvent must next be removed to form a desired aerogel monolith. To do this,<br>
the wet gels are quickly placed into an extractor that is filled with liquid carbon<br>
dioxide and a relatively long solvent exchange process begins during which the<br>
temperature and pressure are maintained below critical conditions. Once the solvent<br>
exchange is complete, the extractor is sealed and the sealed extractor is heated to<br>
above the critical point of the CO2. After a short thermal stabilization period, the<br>
extractor is slowly depressurized while it is heated to maintain the temperature inside<br>
the aerogels sufficiently high to avoid condensing the CO2 as the pressure is<br>
decreased to 1 atmosphere.<br>
The time required to perform these steps is highly dependent upon the physical<br>
size of the extractor, and the physical size of the extractor determines the maximum<br>
physical size of an aerogel monolith piece which can be produced. For example, to<br>
prepare five high quality crack-free aerogel monolith panels each of which is 5" x 9"<br>
x 1", (12.7 cm x 22.9 cm x 2.5 cm) a 40 liter extractor is used and the extractor time<br>
required to produce the monolith panels is about 40 hours. This total time begins<br>
with about 5 to 20 minutes to quickly place the wet gels into the extractor. After the<br>
extractor is filled with liquid CO2, it takes about 30 hours to replace the solvent in<br>
the gels using liquid CO2. The solvent exchange step takes so long because it must<br>
rely on the diffusivity of the solvent and the liquid CO2 and the solute solubility of<br>
liquid CO2. It is performed by adding CO2 into the top of the extractor while<br>
draining it out of the bottom until close to 100% of the solvent used to prepare the<br>
gels has been extracted. Then it takes about 2 to 2.5 hours to heat the extractor to<br>
above the critical point of CO2 (7378 kPa and 31.06°C). It takes this long because<br>
the heating must be done at a sufficiently low rate to avoid causing damage to the<br>
resulting aerogels. Next there is a thermal stabilization period of about ½ hour.<br>
Finally, the depressurization commonly takes about 6 hours.<br>
In total, it currently takes about 40 hours of extractor time to produce a single.<br>
batch of five 5" x 9" (12.7 x 22.9 cm) flawless 1" (2.5 cm) thick aerogel panels in a<br>
40 liter extractor.<br>
The length of time for aerogel drying is also dependent upon the pore size<br>
distribution, tortuosity of the pores and thickness of the aerogel products being pre-<br>
pared since it is the thickness, i.e. the smallest dimension, that determines the<br>
distance required for heat and mass diffusion during the drying. The times needed<br>
for solvent exchange and depressurization steps vary approximately proportionally<br>
to the thickness squared.<br>
Quite simply, this time period has been found to be far too long for aerogel<br>
products to be cost competitive with alternative products, e.g. other types of insula-<br>
tion. Moreover, the time is highly dependent upon the physical size of the extractor,<br>
and larger extractors would require an even greater operating time for a single batch<br>
of the same sized and shaped gels so that the initial capital investment for large scale<br>
production of large aerogel monoliths is too high. In addition to the physical size<br>
and shape of wet gels to be dried, the solvent exchange step depends upon the total<br>
amount of solvent that must be extracted. The heating step requires heat to be<br>
applied on the extractor walls and then travel through liquid CO2 to reach the gels<br>
while avoiding a temperature gradient that is so steep that it causes thermal shock or<br>
damage to the still wet gels. And the depressurization is conducted very slowly to<br>
supply an adequate amount of heat, again through the extractor walls, to heat the<br>
immediate layers of CO2 that in turn has to transmit the heat throughout the entire<br>
aerogel volume and the extractor to minimize the possibility of thermal and fluid<br>
dynamic-induced damage.<br>
The present invention is the result of research focused on reducing the<br>
processing time for preparing aerogel products once wet gels have been placed inside<br>
an extractor for supercritical drying.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to substantially reduce the time needed<br>
for supercritical drying of wet gels to form an aerogel product.<br>
It is a further object to rapidly produce aerogel products while avoiding<br>
creating surface tension induced failures within the aerogels.<br>
It is a still further object to produce aerogel products while maintaining the<br>
temperature within the wet gels sufficiently spatially uniform to avoid thermal-<br>
induced stress fractures within the gels.<br>
It is a still further object to produce aerogel products while maintaining the<br>
fluid surrounding the wet gels at substantially the same temperature and pressure as<br>
the fluid within the wet gels.<br>
These and still further objects will be apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of this invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to methods of preparing aerogel products by an<br>
improved supercritical drying process.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the preparation and/or loading<br>
of gels at process temperature to eliminate extractor time to reach the process<br>
temperature after the loading.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to maintaining the extractor wall<br>
temperature at the process temperature to eliminate the time to heat the solid mass<br>
of the extractor that will be well insulated thermally.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of gaseous CO2 to pre-<br>
pressurize an extractor that is loaded with wet gels for flash-free fast injection of<br>
supercritical CO2 without causing any flow-induced damage to the gel structures.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of CO2 the temperature<br>
of which is about the supercritical extraction process temperature and the gel<br>
temperature to pre-pressurize an extractor loaded with wet gels without causing any<br>
temperature gradient induced damage to the gel structures during pre-pressurization.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of gaseous CO2 injected<br>
into an extractor as a means of displacing the bulk of the free solvent before<br>
supercritical CO2 is injected into the extractor.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of supercritical CO2<br>
injected into an extractor to displace the bulk of the solvent before supercritical CO2<br>
is injected into the extractor.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of supercritical CO2<br>
injection as a means of direct heat exchange into the supercritical CO2 in the<br>
extractor during depressurization to prevent condensation of supercritical CO2. This<br>
eliminates most of the solvent remaining in the gels as the supercritical CO2 is<br>
removed from the gel by depressurization to just below critical pressure.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of a non-reacting, non-<br>
condensing gas as a means of direct heat exchange into gaseous CO2 and gas<br>
exchange with gaseous CO2 inside the gels during depressurization to prevent<br>
condensation of CO2. This significantly shortens the duration of depressurization<br>
compared to the conventional slow depressurization in that heat is supplied indirectly<br>
through the extractor wall.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of a liquid pump<br>
followed by a heat exchanger to increase the pressure and temperature of CO2 in a<br>
pipe to supercritical conditions to feed into an extractor.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of a liquid pump<br>
followed by a heat exchanger to increase the pressure and temperature of CO2 in an<br>
extractor to supercritical conditions.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of continuous flow<br>
supercritical CO2 extraction right from the outset to perform solvent exchange and<br>
extraction.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of a non-reacting, non-<br>
condensing gas to remove most of the gaseous CO2 during depressurization to sig-<br>
nificantly reduce the total amount of heating required during depressurization to<br>
prevent condensation of the remaining CO2. The use of the non-reacting, non-<br>
condensing gas also enables direct heating of aerogels by a non-reacting non-<br>
condensing gas during the depressurization.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of a non-reacting non-<br>
condensing gas as a direct heating medium during depressurization. The gas takes<br>
the heat energy to the gel pieces where the heat energy is needed to significantly<br>
reduce depressurization time.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to an aerogel drying process the<br>
duration of which is substantially equipment scale/size insensitive.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of pressure fluctuation<br>
to enhance the solvent exchange procedure for the wet gels such as water/ethanol<br>
exchange for wet gels made from water glass and acid catalysts.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of pressure fluctuations<br>
to enhance the supercritical fluid/solvent exchange process, in that high frequency<br>
fluctuations increase the effective mass and heat diffusivity at the interface between<br>
the supercritical fluid phase and the solvent, and low frequency fluctuations increase<br>
the effective mass transport and heat transfer rates through the gel structure.<br>
More particularly, this invention is directed to the use of pressure fluctuation<br>
to reduce the time required for depressurization and still avoid condensation of the<br>
super-critical fluid into a liquid by low frequency pressure fluctuations that increase<br>
the effective mass transport and heat transfer rates through the gel structure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention is directed to an improved process for the<br>
manufacture of any aerogel product, including beads, monoliths and composites.<br>
As used herein, an "aerogel" includes (unless context requires a narrower<br>
mean-ing) not only a conventional aerogel, but also similar structures that have a<br>
micro-porous or nanoporous lattice structure from which a solvent has been removed,<br>
such as a xerogel, silica gel, zeolite, or water glass. The term "beads" refers to<br>
aerogel bodies of generally spherical shape having a diameter, that is typically in the<br>
range of tenths of millimeters to about a centimeter. The term "monolith" refers to<br>
a single aerogel body having a minimum dimension, i.e. thickness, with the other two<br>
dimensions being larger than the thickness, or to a cylindrical object having a<br>
diameter. The thickness or diameter is typically in the range of millimeters to tens<br>
of centimeters. The term "composite" refers to an aerogel that has been formed with<br>
another substance, e.g. glass fibers, in the gels.<br>
The term "solvent" refers to the liquid dispersion medium used to form the<br>
gels and that is removed to form aerogels in accordance with this invention. It is a<br>
non-supercritical fluid at the pressure and temperature of interest.<br>
The term "gas" denotes a fluid where the pressure is below the supercritical<br>
pressure for that fluid and the temperature is higher than the vapor pressure at the<br>
temperature.<br>
The term "fluid" refers to any of a gas, a vapor, and a liquid.<br>
The term "supercritical fluid," refers to a fluid having a pressure above the<br>
critical pressure and a temperature above the critical temperature required to make<br>
a particular fluid supercritical.<br>
The term "pulse" refers to a brief disturbance of pressure in a fluid by the<br>
application of vibrational energy, generally in the form of separate and discrete<br>
pulses, for example a shock wave or a cycle of a continuous wave, or a discrete<br>
period of application of a continuous wave. The pulse (or wave) preferably has a<br>
sinusoidal wave form, but other wave forms, e.g. saw-tooth, square, Gaussian, and<br>
harmonics of any of these, may be used. The frequency or the amplitude of a series<br>
of pulses can be ramped.<br>
While the process of the present invention is generally described hereinafter<br>
referring to supercritical carbon dioxide as the supercritical extraction fluid, all such<br>
references are intended to include alternative supercritical extraction fluids unless<br>
otherwise specified as specific to carbon dioxide. All references to "critical tempera-<br>
ture," "critical pressure," and "critical conditions," refer to the temperature and<br>
pressure conditions that apply for the specific supercritical fluid being discussed.<br>
AEROGEL MATERIALS<br>
Aerogels are open pore materials with about 80 or more vol. % porosity and<br>
pore sizes ranging from about 0.5 to 500 nanometers. Aerogels may be prepared<br>
from any gel-forming materials from which the solvent used for gelation can be<br>
removed by drying without destroying or substantially shrinking the pore structures<br>
during the drying. The drying can be accomplished through supercritical extraction,<br>
atmospheric drying, freeze drying, vacuum evacuation, or the like. Preferably, aero-<br>
gels are produced by supercritical extraction of the solvent (or any liquid replace-<br>
ment for the solvent) that was used to prepare the starting gels. Preferably aerogels<br>
possess a porosity of at least 85 vol. %, more preferably about 90 vol. % and higher.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, aerogels include xerogels which are<br>
prepared by air evaporation, i.e. by slow direct drying, without a supercritical extrac-<br>
tion step. This is typically accomplished by including a surfactant or pore surface<br>
modifier in the gel-forming mixture. Either additive sharply reduces the surface<br>
tension and thus the force exerted on the gel by the evaporation fluid, and/or imbues<br>
a springback force to reverse pore shrinkage during drying. The drying time is also<br>
very long for xerogels. U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,100 to Smith et al. describes a composite<br>
form of a xerogel-like material. For a detailed discussion regarding the production<br>
of both aerogels and xerogels, see Aerogels: Proceedings of the First International<br>
Symposium, Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany, Sep. 23-25, 1985, J. Fricke,<br>
ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg (1986).<br>
The aerogels of the present invention may be organic, inorganic, or a mixture<br>
thereof. The wet gels used to prepare the aerogels may be prepared by any of the gel-<br>
forming techniques that are well-known to the art including alcogel, hydrogel,<br>
templating, and the like. These techniques are all merely different forms of polym-<br>
erization depending on the solvent or method used for attaining particular micro-<br>
structures. Suitable materials for forming inorganic aerogels are oxides of most of<br>
the metals that can form oxides such as silicon, aluminum, iron, copper, zirconium,<br>
hafnium, magnesium, yttrium, etc. Suitable materials for forming organic aerogels<br>
are polyacrylates, polystyrenes, polyacrylonitriles, polyurethanes, polyimides,<br>
polyfurfural alcohol, phenol furfuryl alcohol, polyfurfuryl alcohol, melamine for-<br>
maldehydes, resorcinol formaldehydes, cresol formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol dialdehyde, polycyanurates, polyacrylamides, various epoxies,<br>
agar, and the like.<br>
Without being bound to a specific type of aerogel or its method of preparation,<br>
for the sake of convenience the alcogel route of forming inorganic aerogels is used<br>
below to illustrate the invention. The invention is applicable to other aerogels and<br>
preparation methods.<br>
Generally the principal synthetic route for the formation of an inorganic<br>
aerogel is the hydrolysis and condensation of an alkoxide. The most suitable metal<br>
alkoxides are those having about 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably about 2 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, in each alkyl group. Specific examples of such compounds include tetra-<br>
ethoxysilane (TEOS), tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), tetra-n-propoxysilane, aluminum<br>
isopropoxide, aluminum sec-butoxide, cerium isopropoxide, hafnium tert-butoxide,<br>
magnesium aluminum isopropoxide, yttrium isopropoxide, zirconium isopropoxide,<br>
and the like.<br>
Suitable materials for use in forming the aerogels to be used at low<br>
temperatures are the non-refractory metal alkoxides based on oxide-forming metals.<br>
Preferred such metals are silicon and magnesium as well as a mixture thereof. For<br>
higher temperature applications, suitable alkoxides are generally refractory metal<br>
alkoxides that will form oxides, e.g. such as zirconia, yttria, hafnia, alumina, titania,<br>
ceria, and the like, as well as mixtures thereof such as zirconia and yttria. Mixtures<br>
of non-refractory metals with refractory metals, such as silicon and/or magnesium<br>
with aluminum, may also be used.<br>
Major variables in the inorganic aerogel formation process include the type of<br>
alkoxide, solution pH, and alkoxide/alcohol/watcr ratio. Control of these varia-bles<br>
can permit control of the growth and aggregation of the aerogel species through-out<br>
the transition from the "sol" state to the "gel" state during drying at supercritical<br>
conditions. While properties of the resulting aerogels are strongly affected by the<br>
pH of the precursor solution and the molar ratio of the reactants, any pH and any<br>
molar ratio that permits the formation of gels may be used in the present invention.<br>
Generally, the solvent will be a lower alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 4, although other liquids can be used as is known in the<br>
art. Examples of other useful liquids include but not limited to: ethyl acetate,<br>
acetone, dichloromethane, and the like.<br>
For silica aerogel-containing low temperature insulation, the currently<br>
preferred ingredients are tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), water and ethanol (EtOH) and<br>
the preferred ratio of TEOS to water is about 0.2-0.5:1, the preferred ratio of TEOS<br>
to EtOH is about 0.02-0.5:1, and the preferred pH is about 2 to 9. The natural pH of<br>
a solution of the ingredients is about 5. While any acid may be used to obtain a<br>
lower pH solution, HC1, H2SO4 or HF are the currently preferred acids. To generate<br>
a higher pH, NH4OH is the preferred base.<br>
After identification of the aerogel to be prepared, a suitable metal alkoxide-<br>
alcohol solution is prepared. While techniques for preparing specific solutions are<br>
described below, the preparation of aerogel-forming solutions in general, and having<br>
specific compositions, is well known in the art. See, for example, S.J. Teichner et al,<br>
"Inorganic Oxide Aerogel," Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 5, 1976,<br>
pp 245-273, and L.D. LeMay, et al., "Low-Density Microcellular Materials," MRS<br>
Bulletin, Vol. 15, 1990, p 19.<br>
While a single alkoxide-alcohol solution is generally used, a combination of<br>
two or more alkoxide-alcohol solutions may be used to fabricate mixed oxide<br>
aerogels. After formation of the alkoxide-alcohol solution, water is added to cause<br>
hydrolysis so that a metal hydroxide in a "sol" state is present. The hydrolysis<br>
reaction, using tetraethoxysilane as an example, is:<br>
Si(OC2H5)4 + 4 H2O - Si(OH)4 + 4 (C2H5OH) (1)<br>
To form an aerogel monolith, this sol state alkoxide solution is then aged for a<br>
sufficiently long period (commonly overnight) that a condensation reaction, as shown<br>
in Eq. 2:<br>
Si(OH)4 ? SiO2 + 2 H2O (2)<br>
occurs and forms precursors which after supercritical drying in accordance with this<br>
invention become aerogels.<br>
EXTRACTION OF SOLVENT-WETTED GELS<br>
The wet gels that form an aerogel product of this invention may be prepared<br>
by any gel-forming procedure as previously described. The present invention is<br>
independent of the gel-forming technique and specific gel-forming materials, and is<br>
believed to be widely applicable to the solvent extraction and drying of such gels.<br>
Drying of the cast wet gels is slow, and requires prolonged operations under<br>
high pressure and controlled temperature. As noted above, this significantly raises<br>
the cost of aerogels, and prevents their use in numerous otherwise desirable<br>
situations. A good description of the most advanced techniques of the current art<br>
may be found in M. J. van Bommell and A. B de Haan, J. Materials Sci. 29 943-948,<br>
(1994).<br>
The wet gels are formed in or placed into a suitable mold and then aged, com-<br>
monly overnight. In prior art methods, the gels at room temperature are placed into<br>
an extractor at room temperature. In one embodiment of the invention, the wet gels,<br>
either before or after molding, are brought to a temperature above the critical<br>
temperature of the extraction fluid, most commonly CO2 (though other extraction<br>
fluids may be used), by any suitable means that does not cause thermal damage to the<br>
gels. For example, if the wet gels have been prepared at room temperature, they may<br>
be placed in a solvent bath and gradually heated to the appropriate temperature. The<br>
maximum heating rate is determined by the thermal conductivity of the particular gel<br>
formulation, and should be determined experimentally so that cracking is avoided.<br>
Alternatively, the gels may be prepared in a suitable solvent at a temperature about<br>
or above the critical temperature. Still further alternatively, the gels may be placed<br>
in a solvent bath that has been heated to somewhere below the critical temperature,<br>
and then the gels and the solvent bath are heated to above the critical temperature.<br>
In a second embodiment of the method of the invention, the wet gels are<br>
inserted into a heated unpressurized extractor, the walls of which are maintained at<br>
a temperature above the critical temperature of CO2. So long as no problem with<br>
unwanted drying of the gels occurs during loading, then only wet gels need be<br>
loaded, i.e. without additional solvent. If the wet gels would suffer damage due to<br>
drying during loading, then they can be loaded with solvent, preferably inside a<br>
container that is inserted into the extractor. Alternatively, the wet gels can be loaded<br>
into an extractor that has previously been filled with saturated vapor of the solvent<br>
to prevent drying of the wet gel surfaces. The loading process for gel monoliths is<br>
generally performed either by lowering the gel monoliths into a vertical chamber or<br>
by horizontally inserting them into a horizontally-positioned extractor, i.e. by open-<br>
ing the lid or one side of the extractor. The loading process for beads is generally<br>
per-formed by introducing the beads in solvent or a carrier gas, pouring by gravity<br>
or pumping into the extractor through a valve or opening. If the wet gels are not<br>
loaded with additional solvent, the extractor is then filled with extra solvent in liquid<br>
or gaseous form and at a temperature about or above the critical temperature to be<br>
used in the eventual supercritical extraction as described further below.<br>
The next step is the removal of the solvent, both any free solvent surrounding<br>
the wet gels and that solvent contained within the gels. In the prior art, this has been<br>
done either by extraction of the solvent with liquid CO2 (or other suitable fluid.) or<br>
as described in M. J. van Bommell et al, supra, with supercritical CO2.<br>
In the method of the invention, the removal begins in any of several ways in<br>
which the wet gels are al a temperature that is about or above the process temperature<br>
but at a pressure below the eventual process pressure. The solvent removal from the<br>
gels is then completed by addition of a supercritical fluid, e.g. CO2.<br>
For example, if the gels in the extractor are surrounded by solvent outside the<br>
wet gels, that solvent (referred to as "free solvent") can be drained by opening a<br>
valve at the bottom of the extractor. If the gels and solvent are in a container within<br>
the extractor, it is preferred that the container be opened both on top and bottom to<br>
enhance fluid flow. Then the extractor is pressurized by injecting into the extractor<br>
gaseous CO2 at a temperature above the critical temperature and at a pressure that is<br>
below the critical pressure. The gaseous CO2 is above the critical temperature and<br>
it has a much lower density than the liquid solvent. The gaseous CO2 is fed prefer-<br>
ably from the top and will form a bubble space gradually expanding from the top to<br>
squeeze the free solvent toward the bottom of the extractor where it is discharged.<br>
The free solvent is preferably continually separated from the gas and recovered.<br>
Once the bulk of the solvent has been discharged, the gaseous CO2 injection stops.<br>
At this point in the process, the temperature inside the extractor is substantially the<br>
same as that which will be used in the eventual supercritical solvent extraction<br>
process and the pressure is slightly below the critical pressure. Now the supercritical<br>
extraction of the solvent from within the gels is performed by feeding supercritical<br>
CO2 (or other supercritical extraction fluid) into the extractor, either from the top or<br>
the bottom, to remove by diffusion the solvent inside the gels. Supercritical CO2 has<br>
a solute diffusivity that is about 10 times higher than that of liquid CO2 while having<br>
a viscosity that is only about one tenth that of liquid CO2. Thus the diffusion/infil-<br>
tration/extraction is more rapid with supercritical CO2 than with liquid CO2. As the<br>
supercritical CO2 feeding continues, the extractor pressure increases beyond the<br>
critical pressure and all of the CO2 inside the extractor turns supercritical.<br>
Once the extractor has become filled with supercritical CO2, supercritical CO2<br>
containing extracted solvent is continually drained from the bottom of the extractor,<br>
since it is of higher density than pure supercritical CO2. The supercritical CO2 injec-<br>
tion docs not create any violent fluid motion since the extractor is already near, i.e.<br>
within about 1380 kPa, preferably about 345 kPa, and most preferably about 69 kPa<br>
of the supercritical process pressure. For supercritical CO2 the pressure must be<br>
above 7,378 kPa. Preferably it is about 7,585 to 12,411 kPa. The injection process<br>
does not create any thermal shock because the temperatures of the solvent, gels, and<br>
the supercritical CO2 are all practically identical.<br>
An alternative when the gels are in free solvent in the extractor avoids the<br>
initial draining of the solvent. Rather, the clearance volume of the extractor is di-<br>
rectly pressurized by injecting gaseous CO2 at about or above the critical temperature<br>
but below the critical pressure, into the clearance space below the top of the extractor<br>
and above the top surface of the solvent covering the wet gels. The CO2 injection<br>
continues until the pressure builds beyond the critical pressure and all of the CO2<br>
turns supercritical. At this point injection of supercritical CO2 begins and a valve<br>
at or near the bottom of the extractor is opened to allow discharge of the solvent. In<br>
this case the supercritical CO2 that forms an expanding "bubble" from the top, simul-<br>
taneously removing mostly free solvent along with a small amount of the solvent<br>
within the wet gels, by forcing the solvent out the bottom of the extractor. After the<br>
supercritical pressure is reached, then the solvent is drained by the further infusion<br>
of supercritical CO2 into the top of the extractor at substantially the same tempera-<br>
ture as the gels/sol-vent. This process does not create any violent fluid motion since<br>
the clearance volume above the solvent is already pressurized to just below the<br>
critical pressure and the wet gels are immersed in the solvent when supercritical CO2<br>
is first present within the extractor. The injection process does not create any<br>
thermal shock because the temperatures of the solvent, gels and the supercritical CO2<br>
are all substantially the same.<br>
An alternative to the addition of gaseous CO2 into the clearance volume is the<br>
direct injection of supercritical CO2 into that space while the space is at about the<br>
desired supercritical temperature. In this case, the supercritical CO2 will initially<br>
expand into the clearance space and cool down until the pressure builds up to and<br>
beyond the critical pressure Since the wet gels arc immersed in and protected by the<br>
solvent when the supercritical CO2 is added and it expands into the clearance<br>
volume, there will be no thermal or fluid dynamic shock.<br>
A further alternative when the wet gels (either by themselves or on a carrying<br>
tray) are loaded into an extractor without excess solvent is the use of gaseous CO2<br>
to pre-pressurize the extractor to just below the critical pressure, followed by<br>
injection of supercritical CO2 into the extractor. The gaseous CO2 pre-pressurization<br>
does not create any violent fluid motion since it occurs gradually. The supercritical<br>
CO2 injection does not create any violent fluid motion since the extractor is already<br>
substantially at the process pressure. The supercritical CO2 injection does not create<br>
any thermal shock because the temperatures of the solvent, gels and the supercritical<br>
CO2 are all practically identical.<br>
Several steps are proposed here to accelerate the process of preparing an<br>
aerogel. First, during or after the gel being prepared, the temperature of the gel is<br>
raised to near, preferably above, the critical temperature of the extracting super-<br>
critical fluid by the point in time when the gel is to be placed into the extractor.<br>
Likewise, the extractor, and the extracting fluid, and any excess solvent required to<br>
prevent drying, should also be near or preferably at least just above the critical<br>
temperature. Then the wet gel and solvent can be pressurized as rapidly as the gel<br>
can withstand the pressure gradient. A temperature is sufficiently near the critical<br>
temperature for purposes of this invention if it is not more than about 10°C,<br>
preferably not more than about 5°, and more prefer-ably not more than about 2°C<br>
below the critical temperature.<br>
Second, the extracting fluid can be introduced directly in the supercritical<br>
state, or rapidly compressed (with due control of heating) to create extracting liquid<br>
in the supercritical state in the extractor. Then the extraction of the solvent is<br>
performed with supercritical rather than liquid CO2. Because of its increased<br>
diffusivity, extraction with supercritical CO2 is faster than with liquid CO2.<br>
In large scale production, these steps can save significant time compared to<br>
the prior art, by reducing the time required to prepare the system to begin the process<br>
of extracting the alcohol from the wet aerogel with supercritical carbon dioxide.<br>
EXTRACTION OF SOLVENT / INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY BY PULSATIONS<br>
As described above, the current state-of-the art extraction process is<br>
performed by circulating an extraction fluid, either liquid or supercritical, past the<br>
solvent-wet gels, and (in an industrial-scale operation) separating the supercritical<br>
gas from the extracted solvent followed by re-introducing it into the process.<br>
Because the pores in the gels are small, liquid flows through the gels very slowly if<br>
at all. Instead, the primary method of solvent removal from the gels is by diffusion<br>
of solvent out of the gels and into the stream of circulating extraction fluid and<br>
diffusion of the extraction fluid into the gel. The inter-diffusion is inherently and<br>
relatively slow even using supercritical CO2 instead of liquid CO2, and the time<br>
required tends to increase with the square of the thickness of the aerogel body being<br>
produced. In laboratory situations, a few hours may be needed for the exchange. In<br>
production, however, ten to thirty hours may be required to reliably produce multiple<br>
crack-free aerogels of reasonable thickness such as 1 inch. This makes the process<br>
expensive to be commercially viable for wide scale applications.<br>
The efficiency of the solvent exchange procedures with an extraction fluid may<br>
be enhanced by increasing the fluid's effective mass diffusivity. More particu-larly,<br>
improved solvent exchange efficiency may be obtained by cycling or pulsing the<br>
extractor pressure. For example, high frequency low amplitude pressure fluctua-<br>
tions can be used to promote mixing and mass diffusion. Alternatively, low frequen-<br>
cy high amplitude pulsations can be used to effectively pump out higher solvent<br>
concentration solution (e.g. solution of ethanol in supercritical CO2) from inside the<br>
gels and pump in lower solvent concentrated solution into the gel if the extraction<br>
fluid is compressible which is the case with supercritical fluids such as CO2. Prefer-<br>
ably two different pulsations arc used simultaneously for compressible fluids. The<br>
pressure cycling/pulsations result in an active pumping and/or enhanced diffusion<br>
and mixing process that is more effective than passively relying on simple diffusion<br>
of solvent from the gels into the supercritical fluid at slowly changing or constant<br>
pressure conditions.<br>
The fluid exchange process is considered to be satisfactorily performed by the<br>
method of extraction when the solvent content in the extraction fluid at the discharge<br>
of the extractor is less than a predetermined level, the exact value of which will<br>
depend upon the specific process being performed, the properties of the fluids<br>
involved (the diffusivities ands viscosities), pore size distribution, physical size and<br>
shapes of the gels being processed, as well as the frequencies and amplitudes of the<br>
pulsations used. Generally however, satisfactory levels will be less than about SO<br>
ppm, preferably less than about 20 ppm, and most preferably less than 1 ppm,<br>
provided that the discharge solvent content is representative of the solvent content'<br>
within the gels.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a theory, it is applicants' belief that high<br>
frequency pulsing accelerates fluid exchange within an aerogel because pulsing<br>
rapidly dilutes the solvent that is near the boundary between the extraction fluid<br>
phase and the liquid solvent phase, inside the gels. This applies to both liquid/liquid<br>
and liquid/-supercritical fluid exchanges.<br>
For mixtures of supercritical fluid and solvent, there is a single phase region,<br>
called a "mixed fluid supercritical region," wherein the mixture with the dissolved<br>
solvent is supercritical. It has unexpectedly been discovered that the single phase<br>
region of supercritical conditions for many solvent/supercritical fluid mixtures<br>
occurs sufficiently near the critical point of the supercritical fluid to use that super-<br>
criticality of the mixed fluid to enhance the rate of extraction of the solvent from<br>
within the gels, thereby reducing the overall process time.<br>
Using the example of ethanol as the solvent and CO2 as the supercritical fluid,<br>
a mixture containing about 50% of each is a single phase and supercritical at<br>
pressures above about 7,585 kPa) and at temperatures above about 35°C. This is near<br>
the usual operating pressures and temperatures for maintaining CO2 in the<br>
supercritical state. Therefore, at the initial moment of contact between the wet gels<br>
and the super-critical fluid, inter-diffusion begins at the interface between the<br>
solvent ethanol inside the wet gels and the supercritical CO2 outside the gels will<br>
begin. The inter-diffusion is enhanced by transmitting a high frequency fluctuation<br>
through the super-critical CO2- As the mixing at the interface continues, the thick-<br>
ness of the mixing region increases. Soon the external portion of the mixing layer<br>
will reach a threshold of "turning supercritical." Since a supercritical fluid is readily<br>
compressible like a gas, as opposed to poorly compressible like a liquid, when the<br>
mixed fluid turns supercritical it is in corn-pressed form both within the extractor<br>
generally and within the gel specifically, more of the molecules will on average move<br>
into the gel. When the gas re-expands, molecules - not necessarily the same<br>
molecules - move out of the "mixed fluid super-critical region" of the gel. Then,<br>
when the next pulse compresses the supercritical fluid, a fresh load of supercritical<br>
CO2 is pushed into the mixed fluid supercritical layer that has by now increased in<br>
thickness. Therefore, to the extent that there is mixing or mutual inter-diffusion<br>
between the solvent liquid and the supercritical mixed fluid, then molecules of the<br>
solvent liquid are mixed into the supercritical mixed fluid and the new mixed fluid<br>
remains supercritical and is removed from the aerogel. This solvent removal is<br>
supplemental to the solvent removal due to pure diffusion, and is much faster.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the mechanism of<br>
diffusion enhancement by high frequency pressure pulses at the interface region of<br>
the solvent (liquid ethanol) and the supercritical mixed fluid phase (containing CO2<br>
and ethanol) is believed to be due to differences in wave propagation speed and<br>
acoustic impedance within the solvent vs. within the supercritical mixed fluid phase.<br>
The pressure wave will first travel through the supercritical phase outside the gel,<br>
then through the mixed fluid supercritical phase near and in the gel, and then arrive<br>
at the interface with the solvent liquid in the gel. Due to the impedance discontinu-<br>
ity, the pressure wave will be split into two waves at the interface: a transmitted<br>
wave and a reflected wave. The fluid particles at two sides of the interface region<br>
will tend to move at different speeds due to different wave propagation speeds. To<br>
accommodate the impedance discontinuity-induced wave phenomena and the particle<br>
velocity discrepancies between the two sides, the interface region between the<br>
portion of the gel still containing solvent liquid and the rest of the gel containing<br>
supercritical mixed fluid will be perturbed and well mixed, thereby promoting<br>
enhanced diffusion across the interface region. This pulse-enhanced diffusion is<br>
much faster than natural diffusion.<br>
As the enhanced diffusion process proceeds, the interface region moves in the<br>
direction of the remaining solvent liquid region of the gel until that region complete-<br>
ly disappears and the entire gel structure contains only supercritical phase fluid.<br>
Once this happens, the whole gel structure participates in the mass transport<br>
enhanced mostly by slower pulses that generate longer distance pumping effect. The<br>
pumping action of the slower pressure pulses rapidly lowers the solvent concentra-<br>
tion inside the gel at a rate much faster than simple diffusion process relying on<br>
concentration gradient. When the concentration of the solvent in the supercritical<br>
phase at the innermost portion of the gel, or the highest local concentration of the<br>
solvent inside the gel, reaches a low level, e.g. less than about 50 ppm, preferably<br>
less than about 20 ppm, and most preferably less than 1 ppm, the solvent extraction<br>
process is considered finished and depressurization can begin.<br>
For low frequency high amplitude pulses are used, they serve to enhance<br>
solvent removal in the following manner. During the expansion period with low<br>
frequency (long wavelength) fluctuations, supercritical mixed fluid having a higher<br>
concentration of dissolved solvent will flow out of the aerogels enhancing the rate<br>
of solvent removal from the gel while during the compression period the supercritical<br>
fluid having a lower concentration of solvent will be forced back into the gel replen-<br>
ishing the gel with fresh supercritical fluid charge at a lower solvent concentration<br>
and at the process temperature of the extractor. For example, the density of super-<br>
critical CO2 will nearly double when the pressure increases from 7585 to 10,340 kPa<br>
at 40°C. In other words, after a compression swing of this amount, fully 50% of the<br>
molecules inside the "mixed-fluid supercritical" layer inside the gel will come from<br>
the fresh supercritical CO2 stream outside the gel, thereby lowering the concentration<br>
of the solvent in the "mixed fluid supercritical layer" and supplying heat to the<br>
"mixed-fluid supercritical" layer that had undergone an expansion-related<br>
temperature drop. During the subsequent expansion stroke, the heat provided during<br>
compression will prevent condensation of the expanding fluid and fully 50% of the<br>
molecules inside the "supercritical** layer will come out of the gel into the super-<br>
critical fluid to be swept away. The low frequency high amplitude compression and<br>
expansion cycles can be repeated until the entire aerogel body is engulfed by "mixed-<br>
fluid supercritical" region and until the innermost part of the aerogel contains mostly<br>
supercritical fluid with only trace amount of solvent.<br>
Also as the pressure increases during the low frequency compression period<br>
and as the fluid is pushed into the gel, the solubility of the supercritical fluid<br>
increases almost as a linear function of the supercritical fluid density, thereby<br>
promoting the diffusion/solvation process inside the gel. Once the solvent has<br>
dissolved into the supercritical fluid and the pressure has decreased, the density of<br>
the supercritical fluid lowers causing the fluid to expand out of the gel. The increase<br>
in solute solubility of a supercritical fluid such as supercritical CO2 with compres-<br>
sion is an additional factor enhancing diffusion of solute from within the gels.<br>
Moreover, it has been found useful to gradually increase the wavelength (decrease<br>
the frequency) of the pressure pulses as the front between the supercritical fluid and<br>
the normal solvent moves into the aerogel and therefore the distance to travel from<br>
the mixing layer to the surface of the gel increases.<br>
Therefore, there is independent utility in each of high-frequency pulses, low-<br>
frequency pulses, and ramping upward (gradual increase) of the wavelength of at<br>
least the low frequency pulses. The combination of two different frequency of<br>
pulses, with optional ramping, is expected to be especially effective.<br>
The amplitude of the high frequency pulses at a given frequency is less<br>
critical. Higher amplitudes will tend to accelerate the exchange process - ideally<br>
linearly, but in practice at less than linearly due to dissipation. The amplitude at a<br>
given frequency also has an upper limit, above which the gradient of pressure during<br>
a pulse is large enough to damage the structure of the gel. Because the pores of<br>
aerogels are so small, the frictional force exerted on the gel structure by passage of<br>
fluid is surprisingly large. For many aerogels, the upper limit will be in the range of<br>
34.5 kPa or so. A pressure amplitude range of about 0.7 to 27.6 kPa will be typical<br>
for most aerogel materials. The maximum permitted pressure amplitude is dependent<br>
on the frequency or wavelength of the sound waves. This is because as the frequency<br>
increases, the rate of gas movement increases, and this can place a higher pressure<br>
gradient across local regions of the aerogel than is found at lower frequencies of the<br>
same amplitude.<br>
For a supercritical CO2 extraction (generally performed at pressures of about<br>
7585 to 12,411 kPa), suitable high frequency pulses will have a frequency in the<br>
range of about 1 to about 100,000 Hz, more typically 2,000 to 50,000 Hz, and in<br>
many cases in the range of about 5000 to 30,000 Hz. Corresponding maximum<br>
allowable pressure amplitudes, which will decrease as the frequency increases and<br>
which will depend on the pore structure of the gel, will typically be in the range of<br>
about 0.07 to about 137.9 kPa, more typically about 2.1 to 34.5 kPa, and often 3.4 to<br>
20.7 kPa.<br>
For the slower pulses, the frequency can be in the range of about 0.0001 to<br>
about 10 Hz, more typically in a range of about 0.001 to about 1 Hz. Pressure<br>
amplitudes generally range from about 69 kPa to up to 6,895 kPa, more preferably<br>
689.5 kPa to 4,137 kPa, provided that the material can tolerate the pressure gradient,<br>
and allowing for the pressure amplitude of the high frequency pulses when used<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Specific pressure amplitude/frequency combinations have to be determined for<br>
particular compositions of aerogels by routine experimentation taking into considera-<br>
tion the specific porosity, pore size distribution, compressive and tensile strengths<br>
of the aerogel lattice structure and physical size and shape. The aerogels are not<br>
damaged during the active extraction process either by fluid dynamic erosion,<br>
pressure difference induced stress, or otherwise. Also, the resulting temperature<br>
swing is not so large as to cause stress failures or loss of supercriticality of the fluid<br>
inside the gel.<br>
Other frequencies or wavelengths be used. It is specifically contemplated that<br>
higher frequencies, for example in the range of 100,000 to 10 million Hz (used in<br>
ultrasound and lithotripsy), may prove to be as useful or more useful than the<br>
presently explored range of about 1 to about 100,000 Hz. Such faster cycles require<br>
lower amplitudes to avoid creating excessive pressure gradients.<br>
In selecting a pulse amplitude, it should also be recalled that an excessive<br>
pressure drop, starting from a particular pressure and temperature, can cause a phase<br>
change of a supercritical fluid into a conventional liquid or gas. If the amplitude is<br>
sufficiently large, it can also cause re-condensation of the solvent into a separate<br>
liquid phase due to a reduction in solubility when the density is reduced by pressure<br>
reduction even though the extraction fluid remains supercritical. If the phase of the<br>
extraction fluid changes from supercritical to a gas, most of the solvent will<br>
recondense due to a drastic reduction in solubility.<br>
If appropriately limited, however, a moderate degree of lowering of the<br>
pressure or density will not cause re-condensation of the solvent, since most super-<br>
critical fluids have very high solute solubility for the usual solvents used to form<br>
aerogels. It should be noted that during pressure fluctuations, the shape and size of<br>
the gel lattices and their pores do not undergo any appreciable dimensional changes<br>
because the pressure will remain sufficiently balanced isometrically provided that (i)<br>
the speed of the change is slow enough to be quasi-steady for the slower pressure<br>
fluctuations, and (ii) the amplitudes of the faster fluctuations are much smaller than<br>
the mean pressure and lower than the threshold pressure to cause structural changes.<br>
There is hydrostatic quasi-equilibrium inside the entire gel volume and during the<br>
cycling that status does not change.<br>
The pressure fluctuation process relies, in one mode, on the fact that super-<br>
critical CO2 behaves like a gas in terms of compressibility. So when compressed<br>
more supercritical CO2 can be packed into the same pore volume as before and when<br>
expanded, the solvent laden supercritical CO2 tends to come out of the gels.<br>
Pulses suitable for the practice of the invention may be generated by any<br>
means or method that gives the required frequency and amplitude of pulsations in<br>
pressure inside the extractor. The source of the pulses can be inside the extractor;<br>
outside the reactor (and typically in intimated contact with it); or forming a part of<br>
the reactor. The pulses may be generated by one or more of a piezoelectric device,<br>
an electromechanical device, a piston, a mechanical device, a diaphragm, a bellows,<br>
an inflatable device, or by variation of the input pressure or the backpressure of a<br>
fluid or a gas flowing through the extractor. For example, a piezo-electric device can<br>
be the driver for a hydrophone, and an electromechanical device can be a solenoid,<br>
as is used in a loudspeaker. A mechanical device could include a striking hammer,<br>
as is used to strike a bell. An inflatable device could be an expandable balloon or<br>
bellows, either within the extractor or exterior to it and connected by a port. An<br>
inflatable device could be inflated by a gas or liquid. Likewise, a piston could be<br>
internal, or external via a port, and could be moved by pressure or by mechanical<br>
force. Each of these ways of generating a series of pressure waves is well known.<br>
For example, back pressure can be varied under electronic control by opening and<br>
partially closing the exit port or the entrance port of an extractor (or other closed<br>
vessel) while applying a constant pressure to a fluid entering or exiting through<br>
another port. Coupling of a source of pulsation to the extractor may be by any<br>
conventional method.<br>
DEPRESSURIZATION PROCESS / INCREASE EFFICIENCY BY PULSATIONS<br>
Once the solvent has been exchanged for supercritical fluid throughout the<br>
entire volume of the aerogel, the next step to complete the preparation of the aerogel<br>
is to release the pressure in the extractor so that the aerogel can be returned to atmos-<br>
pheric pressure. This is a slow process in current conventional practice because if<br>
the pressure is simply released in an uncontrolled manner, the supercritical fluid will<br>
return to a liquid state damaging the aerogels. The supercritical fluid remaining<br>
inside the gels as a result of the solvent exchange procedure will approximately fol-<br>
low isentropic expansion during an uncontrolled depressurization. In other words,<br>
supercritical CO2 will tend to cool as it expands unless sufficient heat is supplied to<br>
the interior of the gels to prevent the supercritical CO2 from turning into liquid CO2<br>
that will damage the aerogels that have been prepared.<br>
Depressurization is typically performed in multiple stages. In a first stage, the<br>
extractor is depressurized to just below the critical pressure while maintaining the<br>
temperature above the critical temperature. This may be done in any conventional<br>
manner, but requires supplying heat to the aerogel so that the CO2 remains a gas as<br>
the pressure crosses through the critical pressure. After the pressure is below the<br>
critical pressure, it is then reduced very gradually until reaching atmospheric<br>
pressure. Since aerogels are efficient insulators, this second stage of the depressur-<br>
ization process is necessarily a slow process. Generally this is done at a rate of about<br>
103 kPa/minute or below, depending on the aerogel sample size, pore distri-bution,<br>
initial pressure, etc.<br>
The difficulty with heat transfer into the gel during depressurization is com-<br>
pounded by the fact that the CO2 must move out of the gel while the heat has to flow<br>
up-steam of the CO2 flow! Moreover, the low solid content of an aerogel structure<br>
through which that heat must flow into the interior of the gels means that solid<br>
conductivity of the heat is also extremely low. The problem is compounded by the<br>
fine lattice structure and torturous heat conduction pathways. However, for a more<br>
rapid depressurization, the heat must be delivered into the interior of the gel faster<br>
than is currently possible.<br>
Two techniques have now been discovered to speed up the depressurization<br>
process. The first technique employs low frequency pressure fluctuations to help de-<br>
liver the necessary heat into the interior of the gel. As a first stage, the process<br>
entails reducing the pressure from above the critical value for the extraction fluid to<br>
just below the critical pressure without condensing the extraction fluid into a liquid.<br>
As the mean pressure is reduced by opening a discharge valve, supercritical CO2, is<br>
pumped into the extractor at a gradually decreasing pressure. While the pressure is<br>
being steadily reduced, a superimposed low frequency pulsation of the pressure is<br>
performed. During the compression portion of the pulse, the relatively warm<br>
supercritical fluid from outside the gel is packed into the interior of the gel, thereby<br>
delivering necessary heat to allow speeding up this first stage of the depressurization<br>
process. Then during the expansion portion of the pulse, the supercritical fluid is<br>
removed from the gels. Thus there is improved heat transfer into the gels.<br>
As a second stage the pressure is reduced from just below the critical pressure<br>
to atmospheric pressure. As the mean pressure is reduced by opening a discharge<br>
valve, heated gas, e.g. CO2 gas, not supercritical CO2, is pumped into the extractor<br>
at a gradually decreasing pressure which is just above the extractor pressure.<br>
Simultaneously, a low frequency pulsation is superimposed to pack in (due to the<br>
compression) warmer CO2 into the interior of the gels, thereby delivering necessary<br>
heat during the superimposed compression cycle and removing the CO2 during the<br>
superimposed expansion cycle to speed up the second stage of the depressurization<br>
process.<br>
An alternative technique for more rapidly performing the depressurization<br>
begins with exchanging the supercritical fluid, e.g. CO2, with an inert gas that will<br>
not turn liquid at the temperatures and pressure ranges encountered during the<br>
depressurization of the reactor to atmospheric temperature. To achieve this, an<br>
injection of a non-reacting non-condensing (NRNC) gas is used. The timing and<br>
method of the NRNC gas injection may be performed in a variety of ways.<br>
Method 1 - Complete exchange of the supercritical CO2 with a non-reacting<br>
non-condensing gas while maintaining the temperature and pressure within the<br>
supercritical region of CO2 until all of it is replaced. This is a good method when the<br>
solvent concentration in the supercritical CO2 inside the gels is so low that<br>
recondensation will not cause harm to the gels as the NRNC gas is injected.<br>
The gas exchange is diffusive, and like solvent extraction, will suffer from the<br>
slowness of a diffusion-limited process. While diffusion of a gas is faster than of a<br>
liquid, it can still require too long to exchange the CO2 for a NRNC gas. Thus, pre-<br>
ferably the inert gas is exchanged for the supercritical gas with the use of pressure<br>
pulses, as described above for the solvent extraction. High frequency pulses accel-<br>
erate gas exchange in the pores. Low frequency, long wavelength pulses pump the<br>
CO2 out from within the gels as well as pump fresh NRNC gas into the gels. The<br>
wavelength can be matched to a characteristic dimension of the aerogels in the<br>
extractor. The inert gas can also be heated, thereby allowing depressurization to<br>
proceed more rapidly even while the gases are being exchanged.<br>
Method 2 - Gas exchange after the supercritical CO2 has been depressurized<br>
to a constant mean pressure just below the critical pressure while pressure pulsations<br>
occur. This method is preferred if the solvent concentration at the end of the solvent<br>
exchange process is still not as low as desired and a final draw down of the solvent<br>
is wanted. In this method, right after the supercritical CO2 is depressurized to just<br>
below the critical pressure in a conventional manner, the CO2 gas is replaced by a<br>
non-reacting, non-condensing gas (NRNC). This process requires that once the<br>
pressure is reduced to below the supercritical range, any residual solvent is at a<br>
sufficiently low concentration as to not cause damage to the aerogels due to either<br>
condensation or sudden reduced solvent solubility of the extraction fluid. Thus at<br>
the beginning of the depressurization process, the fluid in the extractor begins as<br>
supercritical CO2, then it becomes gaseous CO2, then a mixture of gaseous CO2 and<br>
a NRNC gas, and finally NRNC gas after the exchange is completed.<br>
The NRNC gas is preferably heated to about the critical temperature of the<br>
supercritical C02 to maintain a uniform temperature inside and outside of the gels.<br>
This initiates a gas exchange procedure that removes first the gaseous CO2 from<br>
within the aerogel structures and from within the extractor. The NRNC gas will form<br>
a bubble pushing the remaining CO2 out of the extractor. The exchange can be<br>
performed entirely by diffusion into a flowing stream of the NRNC gas.<br>
Preferably, the gas exchange is conducted at a substantially constant mean<br>
pressure just below the critical pressure. This may be performed by continually add-<br>
ing a heated non-reacting non-condensing gas at the same or higher pressure than is<br>
in the extractor until the CO2 is sufficiently removed that there is no longer any risk<br>
of damage from CO2 condensation within the aerogels. To speed up this gas-to-gas<br>
exchange step of the depressurization process, low frequency pressure pulses around<br>
the mean pressure are applied. The low frequency pulses pump the CO2 out from<br>
within the gels as well as pump fresh NRNC gas into the gels. The two mechanisms<br>
will work in tandem with each other. First, by enhancing inter-diffusion between<br>
CO2 gas and NRNC gas, and second, by the pumping effect. After the highest con-<br>
centration of CO2 within the gels drop below a level (e.g., SO ppm, preferably 20<br>
ppm, most preferably 10 ppm) that could pose a threat of condensation related dam-<br>
ages, then the extractor pressure may be reduced to atmospheric pressure without<br>
needing to provide heat transfer to the inside of the aerogels without further pressure<br>
pulsations.<br>
There are several advantages to performing the gas exchange before depressur-<br>
ization. By replacing the CO2 with a heated non-reacting, non-condensing gas, the<br>
de-pressurization can proceed rapidly since the NRNC gas cannot liquefy during<br>
depressurization, no matter how fast it occurs. Of course, even in this case the<br>
depressurization must not be so rapid that the physical strength of the aerogel to<br>
tolerate the pressure differential between inside and outside the gels is exceeded.<br>
Since the risk of phase change during rapid depressurization is precluded, thermal<br>
stress is not a problem since the temperatures both inside and outside the gels will<br>
fall simultaneously, i.e. the temperature will remain uniform spatially but not<br>
temporally. The time needed for the gas exchange is limited only by the gas-to-gas<br>
diffusion inside the gels.<br>
Method 3 - Gas exchange from the start of the depressurization process until<br>
the end as the pressure floats down, preferably with pressure pulses being used<br>
throughout the entire process. While this method does not require aay waiting time<br>
at a fixed pressure to exchange gases, the depressurization in later stages cannot be<br>
as fast as the other two methods because the possibility of damage caused by<br>
recondensation of the extraction fluid, e.g. CO2, remains. This third method entails<br>
simultaneous gas exchange and gradual pressure reduction. In this case, a heated<br>
non-reacting, non-condensing (NRNC) gas is injected into the extractor and exchang-<br>
ed with the super-critical CO2 inside the aerogels to avoid condensation of the CO2.<br>
The NRNC gas serves as the primary means of supplying heat to the aerogels evenly<br>
and quickly to prevent condensation of the remaining CO2 within the aerogel pores.<br>
The pressure of the gas is floated down along with the pressure of the extractor. This<br>
gradual reduction of pressure can be accomplished by means of a compressor with<br>
appropriate intake and discharge valves to divert excess non-reacting, non-condens-<br>
ing gas flow into a suitable gas storage tank. Interdiffusion of the NRNC gas and the<br>
CO2 through the aerogel thickness determines how fast the heat and gases can be<br>
transmitted or interdiffused to the interior of the aerogels. The speed of the simul-<br>
taneous gas exchange and depressurization is mainly limited by gas-to-gas diffusion<br>
inside the gels and the rate of heat transfer from the gases outside the gels to the CO2<br>
inside the gels. Since there is a close coupling of gas diffusion/exchange and heat<br>
diffusion, the process of heating the remaining CO2 in the interior of gels is more<br>
efficient than simple heat diffusion through the gels.<br>
Suitable non-reacting, non-condensing gases useful herein for any of the above<br>
mentioned three depressurization methods include, but are not limited to, nitrogen,<br>
helium, argon, and dry air. The gas must not unintentionally react with the gels or<br>
the solvent and it must not condense into a liquid at the temperatures and pressures<br>
of use. Preferably the gas is nitrogen, dry air, or helium. Nitrogen will generally be<br>
used because it is relatively inexpensive. When dry air is available, it will be even<br>
less expensive than nitrogen. Helium, with its much higher thermal and mass<br>
diffusivity than either of the other two gases is the preferred gas when the rate of<br>
heat transfer and gas inter-diffusion through a gel block becomes crucial, such as<br>
when large wet gel monoliths are to be dried quickly. Suitable but less preferred<br>
gases for CO2 exchange include hydrogen, oxygen, methane, ethane, neon and argon.<br>
The frequency ranges of suitable pulses described above for the exchange of<br>
a supercritical fluid for a solvent liquid also apply to gas/supercritical fluid ex-<br>
change. The pressure amplitudes acceptable for a particular frequency and aerogel<br>
will tend to increase, since the fluids are on average less dense and have much lower<br>
viscosity which decreases the stress on the aerogel at a particular pressure amplitude<br>
for a given frequency.<br>
The pressure cycling/pulsations produce an active gas exchange process that<br>
is more effective than relying solely on the passive method of simple inter-diffusion<br>
of gases inside aerogels at slowly changing or constant pressure conditions. The<br>
process does not involve any changes in the pore matrix shape or size -- there is<br>
quasi-hydro-static equilibrium inside the entire gel volume and during cycling that<br>
status will not change.<br>
In short, use of the preferred embodiment of Method 2 of the aerogel drying<br>
process of this invention has reduced the time of extraction and drying from the<br>
nearly 40 hours required for a conventional liquid CO2 aerogel process to produce<br>
high quality aerogels of 1 inch (2.54 cm) thickness to less than 8 hours and with<br>
optimization is expected to decrease the time to 4 hours or less.<br>
ALTERNATIVE AEROGEL PREPARATIONS<br>
The invention is applicable to aerogels that are prepared by a process that does<br>
not include supercritical fluid extraction and depressurization as described above.<br>
More particularly, it is applicable to aerogels prepared by a liquid-liquid<br>
extraction process at atmospheric conditions as is used to wash salt-laden water from<br>
hydro-gels made from water glass or to exchange water for an alcohol for hydrogels<br>
made from water glass. Water glass (sodium silicate) contains the essential compon-<br>
ent to form silica aerogels and is one of the least expensive precursors capable of<br>
making silica aerogels, generally costing less than 10% of that of tetra-ethoxysilane.<br>
Adding a catalyst such as sulfuric acid to water glass produces a wet gel that also<br>
contains salt and water which must be removed to make pure aerogels. A long and<br>
laborious salt washing step using fresh water is required to remove the salt from the<br>
water glass derived hydrogel. And even after the salt is removed, since water is<br>
effectively immiscible with common solvent exchange fluids such as CO2 or super-<br>
critical CO2, the water in the wet gel must then be replaced with a solvent like<br>
ethanol that is miscible with or highly soluble in CO2 or other fluids for supercritical<br>
extraction. Direct drying of a water glass hydrogel gives a dense, collapsed struc-<br>
tures unless a xerogel drying process is utilized.<br>
Use of high frequency pulses to promote the diffusion enables washing of the<br>
salt from inside the hydrogel into the water to the outside in a much more expe-<br>
ditious manner than simple diffusion-limited water soaking. High frequency pulses<br>
can also be used to expedite the exchange of water with ethanol. Then the ethanol<br>
can be re-moved from the wet gels to form aerogels by conventional processing.<br>
More preferably, however, it is removed by the more rapid supercritical processing<br>
and rapid gas exchange processes described above for supercritical extraction pro-<br>
cessing. The operating parameters for pulse frequency, amplitude, method of genera-<br>
tion and the like are substantially the same as described. Specific preferred condi-<br>
tions will depend upon the specific system and equipment available for use. Since<br>
such conditions can be determined by routine trial and error based upon the princi-<br>
ples of pulsation described, further details are not necessary. This process of liquid-<br>
liquid extraction via pulsation opens up new possibilities of speeding up the process<br>
and render it inexpensive for making aerogels with significantly lower raw materials<br>
costs.<br>
Xerogels are formed by slow direct drying of wet gels containing one or more<br>
special additives that enable the drying to occur without substantial reduction in<br>
porosity and without the supercritical extraction step described above. This type of<br>
drying of the wet gels to form xerogels can also be enhanced by use of the pulsation<br>
technique described herein. More specifically, when a wet gel containing a solvent<br>
liquid (e.g. water) is exposed to a drying gas (e.g. air), the vapor pressure in the dry<br>
air is lower than the vapor pressure of the liquid solvent contained in the pores of the<br>
gel. Therefore, the solvent liquid will begin to evaporate. As the evaporation front<br>
moves inward, a layer of pores will form that are filled with vapor of the solvent<br>
liquid starting from the saturation concentration at the liquid interface and gradually<br>
decreasing toward the surface of the gel. The vapor pressure of the solvent is much<br>
higher within the pores than outside the gel. The normal drying process relies on<br>
simple diffusion of high concentration vapor from inside the gel into the outside.<br>
Since the liquid is surrounded or bathed in the high vapor concentration gas inside<br>
the gel, the rate of drying is relatively slow. When pressure pulses are used as<br>
described herein, however, during compression low frequency pulses will effectively<br>
pump in largely fresh air from outside into the pores of the gel where there are high<br>
concentration vapor. During expansion the concentrated vapor inside the pores will<br>
be pumped out. So, instead of having to wait for the concentration gradient to work<br>
its way through passive diffusion, the slow frequency pulsation will much more<br>
quickly remove the high concentration vapor from within the gels. As a result, the<br>
remaining liquid is exposed to a low concentration vapor pressure at the interface<br>
with the drying gas within the gel structure. High frequency small amplitude pulsa-<br>
tions of the drying gas to promote the vaporization may also be used, either alone or<br>
in combination with the low frequency pulses. Use of the high frequency pulses will<br>
be akin to "ocean spray" effect by creating disturbances of particles at the liquid-gas<br>
interface thereby increasing the surface area of the liquid vapor interaction and<br>
enhancing the vaporization.<br>
Frequencies and amplitudes for the pulsations will depend on properties such<br>
as density, viscosity, diffusivity, saturation vapor pressure at the process tempera-<br>
ture of the liquid, gas; gel pore dimensions, distribution, tortuosity of the open pores,<br>
size and shape of the gels, etc.<br>
The use of the pressure pulsation techniques described herein make previous<br>
diffusion-limited exchange processes much more rapid which should lead to new<br>
synthetic pathways for the preparation of aerogels and similar materials. The pulsa-<br>
tion methods are useful in any of the nine possible exchange types, i.e. each of<br>
liquid, gas, and supercritical fluid with each of liquid, gas and supercritical fluid.<br>
TEST CELL FOR OBSERVING EXTRACTIONS<br>
A convenient way to optimize the sequence or sequences of pulses is to set up<br>
a pressurizable cell with windows, as an analog of the extractor. Standard pieces of<br>
solvent-filled aerogels can be made, placed in the cell, surrounded with supercritical<br>
fluid, and observed under the influence of pulses. Any evaluation method that does<br>
not require opening the test cell to measure the rate of efflux of the solvent from the<br>
gel may be used. For example, a change in the refractive index is potentially measur-<br>
able for any solvent or supercritical fluid or combination. Alternatively, the concen-<br>
tration of solvent in the exiting supercritical fluid can be measured. This is an<br>
advantageous method, especially if correlated with other methods, because it requires<br>
no special apertures or sensors in the extractor.<br>
A more direct method is to place a dye in the solvent used to prepare the wet<br>
gels or in the supercritical fluid and to observe the rate of removal of the dye from<br>
the gels, or the penetration of the dye into the gels, under various pulsing conditions.<br>
Optimizing the rate of change of the boundary location by varying the frequency or<br>
amplitude of the pulses becomes a rapid and straightforward procedure, readily<br>
giving a significantly improved exchange procedure by minimal experimentation.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Two wet gel samples were prepared from tctra-ethoxysilane (TEOS) esscn-<br>
tially as described in the art. A red dye soluble in ethanol but not in CO2 was dis-<br>
solved into ethanol. During the gel preparations, the ethanol-dye solution was used<br>
in place of conventional pure ethanol. This resulted in red-colored wet gel samples.<br>
To evaluate the effect of sonic pulses on the enhancement of diffusion process, two<br>
wet gel samples were processed as follow after overnight curing. The first was<br>
simply immersed in a jar containing pure ethanol and the diffusion of the red dye was<br>
monitored. The second was also immersed in a jar of pure ethanol, but then the jar<br>
was placed in a small sonic cleaning bath with a 1.25 cm thick sponge pad placed<br>
between the bath and the jar to attenuate the sonic amplitude and to prevent pre-<br>
mature breakage of the gels by the sonicator. The sonic cleaning bath generated<br>
fixed-wavelength pulses at 20 kHz. The diffusion of the red dye out of the gels into<br>
the ethanol was observed and periodically photographed. A UV spectrometer<br>
measured the frequency of the UV light transmitted through the ethanol.<br>
The results show that the dye was extracted more rapidly in the sample that<br>
was sonicated. Extraction to approximate equilibrium was obtained in about 45<br>
minutes in the pulse-treated gel, but has not reached completion after 16 hours in the<br>
absence of pulsation. UV spectrometer plots confirmed that the sonically enhanced<br>
diffusion was approximately 20 times faster than the natural diffusion.<br>
The diffusion enhancement by pressure pulsation technique is not limited to<br>
supercritical fluids or gas-to-gas exchanges. Liquid-liquid extractions can also be<br>
accelerated by pulsation. Although liquids (here, ethanol) are relatively incom-<br>
pressible in comparison with supercritical CO2 or gases), it was found that use of a<br>
fixed-wavelength source of pulsation at 20 kHz decreased the extraction time by a<br>
factor of about three in early stages, and probably in excess of twenty or more at later<br>
stages to accomplish an extraction in about 45 minutes that required about 16 hours<br>
without pulsation.<br>
