FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus, systems, and methods for<br>
reducing inverter losses, in particular voltage source inverter losses. More particularly it<br>
relates to managing the thermal properties and current distortion of power switches in<br>
voltage source inverters when supplying voltage to an electric motor producing a large<br>
amount of torque at low output frequencies.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Many applications (e.g., motor drive systems for electric or hybrid motor vehicles) utilize<br>
a voltage source inverter (VSI). Typically, the VSI supplies voltage to a multi-phase<br>
electric motor (e.g., an alternating current (AC) motor), which in turn, drives the wheels<br>
of the electric or hybrid motor vehicle.<br>
Thermal management issues concerning power switches within the VSI arise when the<br>
VSI supplies voltage to the electric motor when the electric motor is producing large<br>
amounts of torque at low output frequencies (including zero output frequency). That is,<br>
the VSI is applying a low (or zero) voltage across the motor phases while receiving a<br>
constant input voltage (i.e., a direct current (DC) voltage). When operating at low<br>
output frequencies, the average voltage supplied by the VSI is small compared to the<br>
input voltage; however, the current the VSI supplies may be at the switch-rated current<br>
for the VSI.<br>
These thermal management issues typically arise when the electric motor is producing<br>
large amounts of torque at low or zero output frequencies because of slowly changing<br>
AC currents in the VSI. That is, a power switch in the VSI may be required to<br>
continuously carry the peak phase current or at least carry the peak phase current for<br>
an extended period of time, which causes constant high power dissipation inside the<br>
power switch and represents a worst-case operating condition for a VSI switch.<br>
A conventional solution for this situation is to time-limit the VSI operation at zero output<br>
frequency and full output current. Unfortunately, this solution is problematic for some<br>
applications (e.g., electric and hybrid motor vehicles) because it limits the time during<br>
which large amounts of torque may be applied by the electric motor (e.g., during vehicle<br>
start).<br><br>
Another close prior art to the present invention is US2005024902. It recites a method<br>
for thermal management in a voltage source inverter. The method includes sensing a<br>
low output frequency condition, determining a zero vector modulation responsive to the<br>
sensed low output frequency condition, and applying the determined zero vector<br>
modulation to reduce thermal stress in the voltage source inverter. The step of<br>
determining the zero vector modulation responsive to the sensed low output frequency<br>
condition includes mapping an output voltage requirement to a space vector structure<br>
and determining state switching space vectors based on the mapped output voltage<br>
requirement. The step of determining the state switching space vector includes<br>
determining active state switching space vectors associated with the state switching<br>
space vectors, determining duty cycles for the active state switching space vectors<br>
based on the active state switching space vectors, and determining a duty cycle for at<br>
least one zero state switching space vector based on the determined duty cycles of the<br>
active state switching space vectors and a switching period.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to apparatus, systems, and methods for reducing inverter<br>
losses when the electric motor is producing large amounts of torque at low output<br>
frequencies (including a zero output frequency). Furthermore, other desirable features<br>
and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent<br>
detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Apparatus are provided for reducing losses in an inverter coupled to a motor. One<br>
apparatus comprises a sensor couplable to the motor and configured to sense an<br>
operating frequency and an amount of torque produced by the motor. The apparatus<br>
also comprises a controller coupled to the sensor and configured to determine a zero<br>
vector modulation (ZVM) based on the sensed frequency and torque.<br>
Various embodiments of the invention also provide a system for reducing losses in an<br>
inverter coupled to a motor. A system comprises means for sensing a threshold torque<br>
of the motor. A system comprises means for sensing a threshold output frequency of the<br>
motor and means for sensing a threshold torque of the motor. The system also<br>
comprises means for determining a ZVM for the inverter based on the sensed threshold<br>
output frequency and the threshold torque.<br>
Methods for reducing losses in an inverter coupled to a motor are also provided. One<br>
method comprises the steps of sensing that the motor is<br><br>
operating below a threshold frequency and sensing that the motor is producing<br>
torque above a threshold torque amount. The method also comprises the step<br>
of determining a ZVM for the inverter based on the sensed frequency and<br>
torque.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background,<br>
summary, or the following description of exemplary embodiments.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a conventional motor<br>
drive system 100 including a voltage source inverter (VSI) 110 and an<br>
alternating current (AC) motor 120. VSI 110 includes a power supply (Vbalt),<br>
a plurality of diodes (e.g., diodes D11- D23), and a plurality of switches (e.g.,<br>
switches 111 - 123). FIG. 1 also shows VSI 110 as having a plurality of<br>
nodes (e.g., nodes N11 - N15) for illustrative purposes.<br>
[0020] As illustrated in FIG. 1, Vbalt includes a positive terminal (+)<br>
coupled to node Nn, and a negative terminal (-) coupled to node N12. The<br>
cathode of diode D11 is coupled to node Nn, and the anode is coupled to node<br>
N13. The cathode of diode D12 is coupled to node N11, and the anode is<br>
coupled to node N14. The cathode of diode D13 is coupled to node N11, and the<br>
anode is coupled to node N15. Similarly, the cathode of diode D21 is coupled<br>
to node N13, and the anode is coupled to node N12. The cathode of diode D22<br>
is coupled to node N14, and the anode is coupled to node N12. The cathode of<br>
diode D23 is coupled to node N15, and the anode is coupled to node N12.<br>
[0021] Diodes D11 - D23 are each coupled in parallel with a respective one<br>
of switches 111-123. This combination of a diode coupled in parallel with a<br>
switch is known as a "power switch" configuration. Each power switch is<br>
capable of conducting current in two directions, and is also capable of<br>
stopping voltage in one direction. Two series-coupled power switches form<br>
what is generally known as an "inverter branch." As FIG. 1 illustrates, VSI<br>
110 comprises three inverter branches (e.g., inverter branches 150, 250, and<br>
350).<br><br>
[0022] Switches 111 - 123 control the flow of current within a portion of<br>
each respective branch of VSI 110. In one embodiment (see FIG. 2), switches<br>
111 - 123 are software controlled switches utilizing high frequency pulse<br>
width modulation (PWM) techniques. As used herein, reference to an "upper<br>
switch" refers to one or more of switches 111-113, and reference to a "lower<br>
switch" refers to one or more of switches 121-123.<br>
[0023] AC motor 120 includes three terminals (e.g., terminals I1 - I3)<br>
coupled to VSI 110. Terminal I1 is coupled to node N13, terminal I2 is coupled<br>
to node N14, and terminal I3 is coupled to node N15. AC motor 120 is<br>
energized with a voltage supplied from VSI 110 and produces a mechanical<br>
output based on the supplied voltage.<br>
[0024] VSI 110 includes six current bi-directional, voltage uni-directional<br>
power switches (e.g., switches 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, and 123). During<br>
operation, one switch in each inverter branch is open and the other switch is<br>
closed. In this configuration, closing a switch allows current to flow within a<br>
portion of the inverter branch, whereas opening the switch prevents current<br>
from flowing within that portion.<br>
[0025] For example (see FIG. 1), closing switch 111 allows current to<br>
flow from power supply Vbalt to terminal I1 via node N13. Alternatively,<br>
closing switch 111 may also allow current to flow in the opposite direction<br>
from terminal I1 to supply Vbatt (via node N13), depending on the operating<br>
conditions of AC motor 120.<br>
[0026] A high frequency PWM technique is utilized to control the output<br>
voltage magnitude, phase angle, and the frequency. That is, while the power<br>
switches are controlled to operate at a substantially constant switching<br>
frequency (fsw), the switch duty cycles are modulated to produce three-phase<br>
voltages of desired magnitude, phase, and frequency.<br>
[0027] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a<br>
system controller 200 for managing the thermal properties and current<br>
distortion of the power switches in VSI 110 when AC motor 120 is producing<br><br>
large amounts of torque at low speeds. System 200 includes one or more<br>
sensors 210 coupled to AC motor 120. The sensors employed may be either,<br>
or a combination of, physical hardware sensors or their virtual software or<br>
mathematical equivalents.<br>
[0028] The one or more sensors 210 are configured to sense the torque AC<br>
motor 120 is producing (or a current-mapped representation of the torque) and<br>
the rotational frequency of AC motor 120. The torque AC motor 120 is<br>
producing and the rotational frequency at which it is operating is transmitted<br>
from sensor(s) 210 to system controller 220.<br>
[0029] System controller 220, in addition to being coupled to sensors 210,<br>
is coupled to VSI 110. System controller 220 is configured to receive the<br>
sensed torque and rotational frequency data of AC motor 120 and to<br>
selectively apply a zero vector modulation (discussed below) to VSI 110.<br>
More specifically, if AC motor 120 is producing torque greater than a<br>
threshold amount of torque and is operating at a rotational frequency below a<br>
threshold rotational frequency, then system controller 220 applies the zero<br>
vector modulation.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a more detailed view of<br>
system controller 220, which comprises a plurality of switch controllers 211 —<br>
223 configured to control switches 111 - 123, respectively. System controller<br>
220 is a control device configured to receive data from sensor 210, process the<br>
received data, and transmit control signals to switch controllers 211 - 223<br>
based on the processed data.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, system controller 220 includes hardware<br>
and/or software configured to receive PWM signals from a pulse-width<br>
modulator (not shown). The PWM signals include instructions for operating<br>
one or more power switches (discussed below) and for producing individual<br>
power switch control signals based on the received PWM signals, as is known<br>
in the art.<br><br>
[0032] For example and with reference to FIGS. 1-3, system controller<br>
220 is implemented as a processing unit comprising one or more memory<br>
devices 2210 (e.g., a programmable read-only memory (PROM), an erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory (EPROM), an electrically erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like) storing software<br>
to enable system controller 220 to conduct various operations. System<br>
controller 220 also comprises a database 2220 (e.g., a look-up table) including<br>
a space vector structure (see e.g., Table 1 below) defining a switching space<br>
vector associated with the switches within each inverter branch (discussed<br>
below) for any given switching combination.<br>
[0033] Switch controllers 211 - 223 are control devices configured to<br>
receive control signals from system controller 220 and supply control signals<br>
to an associated power switch. In one embodiment, switch controllers 211-<br>
223 include hardware and/or software configured to supply power switch<br>
control signals to their respective power switch in response to the control<br>
signals supplied from system controller 220. That is, switch controller 211<br>
provides power switch control signals to the power switch comprised of<br>
switch 111 and diode D11. Similarly, the remaining switch controllers each<br>
provide a power switch control signals to their respective power switches.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br>
[0034] Table 1 is representative of database 2220 (e.g., a look-up table)<br>
associated with VSI 110 and system controller 220 (see FIGS. 1 - 3,<br>
respectively). The switching space vectors V0 - V7 in Table 1 are associated<br>
with the power switches within each inverter branch for any given switching<br>
combination. Inverter branches 150, 250, and 350 each represent two current<br>
bi-directional, voltage uni-directional power switches with one switch within<br>
the inverter branch open, while the other switch within the inverter branch is<br>
closed. Switching space vectors V0 - V7 are created when the three phase-to-<br>
neutral voltages sum-up to zero by allowing each of switching space vectors<br>
V0 - V7 to be associated with a specific inverter switch state.<br>
[0035] As illustrated in Table 1, a VSI comprising three inverter branches<br>
(each inverter branch including two power switches) provides eight possible<br>
switching space vector combinations (i.e., V0 - V7). In an example, and with<br>
reference to FIGS. 1-3 and Table 1, a "0" represents the upper switch of the<br>
indicated inverter branch as being the open switch, while the lower switch<br>
within that inverter branch is the closed switch. A "1" represents the lower<br>
switch of the indicated inverter branch as being the open switch, while the<br>
upper switch within that inverter branch is the closed switch. In this example,<br>
switching space vector V1 indicates that inverter branch 150 is configured with<br>
switch 111 closed and switch 121 open. Furthermore, inverter branch 250 is<br>
configured with switch 122 closed and switch 112 open, and inverter branch<br>
350 is configured with switch 123 closed and switch 113 open.<br>
[0036] Table 1 additionally includes a status column indicating either a<br>
"zero" state or an "active" state for each switching configuration. An active<br>
state indicates that the associated switch configuration results in a net voltage<br>
being applied to the load (e.g., AC motor 120). A zero state indicates that the<br>
associated switch configuration results in the load being effectively shorted.<br>
[0037] FIG. 4 is a hexagonal space vector structure diagram 400<br>
illustrating potential combinations of inverter switch states of system<br><br>
controller 220 (see FIG. 2 and Table 1) in accordance with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 4, the active states (V1 - V6) from Table<br>
1 are utilized to form the vertices of hexagonal space vector structure diagram<br>
400, and the zero states (V0, V7) are located at the center of hexagonal space<br>
vector structure diagram 400. The area lying between the different active<br>
states within the hexagon boundaries are labeled as "s=1, s=2, s=3, ..., s=6"<br>
and are referred to as "space vector" areas. Space vector areas are based on<br>
one of the switching space vectors V0 - V7 that define each respective area.<br>
[0038] During use, any voltage requirement falling within the boundaries<br>
of hexagonal space vector structure diagram 400 may be produced by a<br>
combination of the switching space vectors on a per-cycle basis. Producing<br>
the voltage requirement is accomplished by adjusting a combination of one or<br>
more active state and/or one or more zero state duty cycles within a period<br>
(which is discussed below with reference to FIG. 5). In one example, and with<br>
reference to FIG. 4, a voltage requirement falling within space vector area<br>
"s=l" may be produced by adjusting a combination of active states V1 and V2<br>
and zero states V0 and V7 of duty cycles within a given period Ts to achieve<br>
the required voltage.<br>
[0039] FIG. 5 is an exemplary space vector area diagram 500 illustrating a<br>
portion of hexagonal space vector structure diagram 400 (see FIG. 4) and a<br>
reference vector V* that represents a desired magnitude and phase of the<br>
output voltage of hexagonal space vector structure diagram 400. In one<br>
embodiment (see FIGS. 4 and 5), mapping the reference vector V* to the<br>
space vector area diagram 500 enables the space vector area to be determined<br>
(e.g., the space vector area s=l of FIG. 4). In this embodiment, determination<br>
of the space vector area allows determination of duty cycles t1 - t6 associated<br>
with active state switching space vectors V1 - V6 (which define the space<br>
vector area within a given switching period Ts). Once duty cycles t1 - t6 for<br>
active state switching space vectors V1 - V6 are determined, duty cycles t0 and<br>
t7 for zero state switching space vectors V0 and V7 may then be determined.<br><br>
[0040] In one example with reference to FIG. 5, the total duty cycle t0 + t7<br>
of zero state switching space vectors V0 and V7 is equal to the duration of the<br>
period Ts less the duty cycles t1 and t2 for the switching space vectors V1 and<br>
V2. This example may be expressed as the following mathematical equation:<br><br>
[0041] In this example, zero state switching space vector V0 and/or V7<br>
may be used during the switching period Ts to achieve the completion of the<br>
switching period Ts without affecting the average value of the output voltage<br>
delivered to the load. In one embodiment, utilization of zero state switching<br>
space vector V0 and/or V7 allows optimization of PWM sequencing to achieve,<br>
for example, minimal switching losses, minimal voltage distortion, minimal<br>
current distortion, and the like. Furthermore, utilization of the zero state<br>
switching space vectors V0 and/or V7 allows distribution of conduction losses<br>
among VSI power switches in the inverter branch carrying the largest current.<br>
[0042] At low output frequencies the reference vector V* has a small<br>
magnitude. In one embodiment, the zero vector duty cycle "dz" for reference<br>
vector V* may be mathematically expressed as:<br><br>
[0043] When PWM is utilized so that the highest phase current is not<br>
switched, power dissipation for the power switch carrying the largest amount<br>
of current (Imax), is equal to the maximum conduction power (Pcond) losses (i.e.,<br>
(Pcond) is a function of (Imax))- The power dissipation may be reduced when<br>
conduction loss of the switch carrying the peak current for the duration of the<br>
zero vector duty cycle "d" is greater than the amount of energy needed to turn<br>
the switch ON and OFF (Esw) at the peak current and the switching frequency<br>
fsw.<br><br>
[0044] In an example, and with continued reference to FIG. 5, zero vector<br>
duty cycle "dz" is the duty cycle dz for zero state switching space vector V7. In<br>
this example, the expression may be mathematically expressed as:<br><br>
[0045] Utilization of either zero state switching space vectors V0 or V7<br>
and/or utilization of a combination of zero state switching space vectors V0<br>
and V7 is referred to as "zero vector modulation" (ZVM). The zero state<br>
switching space vectors V0 or V7 are selected periodically at a ZVM frequency<br>
fZvm and a zero vector modulation duty cycle dzvm to reduce power dissipation<br>
in the switch carrying the largest current. A fzvm of 100 Hz utilizing a ZVM<br>
duty cycle dzvm of 0.5 are examples of ZVM implementation.<br>
[0046] When ZVM is utilized, average power dissipation for a ZVM<br>
period (Tzvm) for the power switch experiencing the greatest amount of stress<br>
may be mathematically expressed as:<br><br>
where ZVM duty cycle dzvm is the complementary zero state duty cycle d0 for<br>
zero state switching space vector V0 for the embodiment in FIG. 5 (i.e., the<br>
power dissipation for the switch carrying the largest current is reduced).<br>
However, the total losses for the inverter branch carrying the largest current<br>
are increased and the increase may be mathematically expressed as:<br><br>
[0047] Based on equations 4 and 5, utilizing a smaller complementary<br>
ZVM duty cycle dzvm results in a reduction of power dissipation of the power<br><br>
switch experiencing the greatest amount of stress while producing a relatively<br>
small increase in total inverter loss.<br>
[0048] In an example with reference to FIG. 5, a ZVM frequency fzvm of<br>
10 Hz utilized with a duty cycle d7 for zero state switching space vector V7 of<br>
0.7, and utilizing a ZVM duty cycle dZVm of 0.65 for zero state switching space<br>
vector V0 results in negligible switching losses within a metal oxide<br>
semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) inverter. In this example,<br>
ZVM reduces power dissipation within the power switch carrying the largest<br>
amount of current, thereby allowing control of the junction temperatures.<br>
[0049] FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 600 for providing<br>
improved thermal management in a VSI (e.g., VSI 110) utilizing ZVM<br>
according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Method 600 begins<br>
by monitoring AC motor 120 (step 610).<br>
[0050] AC motor 120 is monitored to determine if AC motor 120 is operating at a frequency less than a threshold frequency (step 620). In one<br>
embodiment, the threshold frequency is in the range of about 3 Hz to about 5<br>
Hz. Other embodiments contemplate that the threshold frequency may be less<br>
than 3 Hz or greater than 5 Hz. If AC motor 120 is operating at a frequency<br>
greater than the threshold frequency, a ZVM is not applied to VSI 110 (step<br>
625).<br>
[0051] AC motor 120 is also monitored to determine if AC motor 120 is<br>
producing an amount of torque greater than a threshold amount of torque (step<br>
630). In one embodiment, the threshold amount of torque is in the range of<br>
about 50% to about 70% of the maximum torque AC motor 120 is capable of<br>
producing. Other embodiments contemplate that the threshold amount of<br>
torque may be less than 50% or greater than 70% of the maximum torque AC<br>
motor 120 is capable of producing. If AC motor 120 is producing an amount<br>
of torque less than the threshold amount of torque, a ZVM is not applied to<br>
VSI 110 (step 635).<br><br>
[0052] If AC motor 120 is operating at a frequency less than the threshold<br>
frequency and is producing an amount of torque greater than the threshold<br>
amount of torque, a ZVM is determined for VSI 110 (step 640). In one<br>
embodiment, a desired output voltage (magnitude and phase), or desired<br>
output voltage vector (e.g., a "reference vector") associated with the sensed<br>
low output frequency condition is mapped to a space vector area within a<br>
space vector structure diagram. In an example with reference to FIGS. 4 and<br>
5, a voltage requirement falling within space vector area "s=l" may be<br>
produced by adjusting a combination of the duty cycles for active state<br>
switching space vectors V1 and V2 and zero state switching space vectors V0<br>
and V7 within a given period Ts to achieve the required voltage. In this<br>
example and with reference to Table 1, each active and zero state switching<br>
space vector comprises three associated inverter branch configurations (e.g.,<br>
inverter branches 150, 250, and 350) defined in Table 1.<br>
[0053] The determined ZVM is then applied to VSI 110 to reduce thermal<br>
stress of VSI 110 (step 650). In one embodiment, the space vector area<br>
including the reference vector is defined by two active state switching space<br>
vectors and a zero vector. A combination of the use of active state switching<br>
space vectors for a pre-determined time (e.g., the active state duty cycle)<br>
within an operating period produces the reference vector. The remaining time<br>
(e.g., the operating period less the active state duty cycle) is allocated for the<br>
use of a combination of zero state switching space vectors.<br>
[0054] In an example with reference to FIG. 5, the duty cycles t1 and t2 for<br>
the switching space vectors V1 and V2 are determined based on the reference<br>
vector V*. The total duty cycle t0 + t7 of zero state switching space vectors V0<br>
and V7 is equal to the duration of the period Ts less the duty cycles t1 and t2 for<br>
the switching space vectors V1 and V2. In this example, either zero state<br>
switching space vectors V0 or V7, or a combination of both zero state<br>
switching space vectors V0 and V7 may be used during the switching period Ts<br>
to achieve the completion of the switching period Ts without affecting the<br><br>
average value of the output voltage delivered to the load. Power is then<br>
delivered to the load (e.g., AC motor 120) based on the duty cycles of the<br>
active and zero state switching space vectors that are associated with the<br>
specific inverter branch configurations discussed with reference to Table 1.<br>
[0055] AC motor 120 is further monitored to determine if a ZVM should<br>
be applied to VSI 110 (step 660). AC motor 120 may be further monitored<br>
after a ZVM has been applied to determine if the operating frequency and<br>
torque conditions remain and the ZVM should continue to be applied, or to<br>
determine that the operating frequency and/or torque conditions no longer<br>
exist and the ZVM should cease to be applied. Furthermore, AC motor 120<br>
may be further monitored prior to a ZVM being applied to determine if the<br>
operating frequency and torque conditions exist so that a ZVM should be<br>
applied to VSI 110, or to determine that the operating frequency and/or torque<br>
conditions continue not to exist and a ZVM should continue to not be applied.<br>
[0056] FIG. 7 is a graph 700 illustrating the conditions when a ZVM is<br>
applied to VSI 110 in accordance with the various exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention. The vertical axis of graph 700 represents the amount of torque<br>
(as a percentage) AC motor 120 is capable of producing, and the horizontal<br>
axis of graph 700 represents the operating frequencies of AC motor 120.<br>
[0057] Graph 700 indicates that a ZVM is applied to VSI 110 when the<br>
amount of torque AC motor 120 is producing is greater than a threshold<br>
amount of torque (e.g., 50 - 70% of the torque AC motor 120 is capable of<br>
producing) and the operating frequency of AC motor is less than a threshold<br>
operating frequency (e.g., 3-5 Hz). Graph 700 also indicates that a ZVM is<br>
not applied to VSI 110 when the amount of torque AC motor 120 is producing<br>
is less than the threshold amount of torque and/or the operating frequency of<br>
AC motor is greater than the threshold operating frequency.<br>
[0058] Although specific ranges of threshold torque values and threshold<br>
operating frequencies have been discussed, the invention contemplates the use<br>
any torque values and/or operating frequencies, whether expressed as a<br><br>
percentage and/or an absolute value. That is, the invention is not limited to the<br>
exemplary values discussed above.<br>
[0059] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>

any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled<br>

departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims<br>
