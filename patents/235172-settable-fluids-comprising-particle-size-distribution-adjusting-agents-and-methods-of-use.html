SETTABLE FLUIDS COMPRISING PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION-ADJUSTING AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to subterranean operations, and more particularly, to settable fluids comprising particle-size distribution-adjusting agents, and methods of using such settable fluids.<br>
Hydraulic cement compositions are commonly utilized in subterranean operations, particularly subterranean well completion and remedial operations. For example, hydraulic cement compositions are used in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings, such as casings and liners, are cemented in well bores. In perforating primary cementing, hydraulic cement compositions are pumped into the annular space between the walls of a well bore and the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened substantially impermeable cement therein that substantially supports and positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surface of the pipe string to the walls of the well bore. Hydraulic cement compositions also are used in remedial cementing operations such as plugging highly permeable zones or fractures in well bores, plugging cracks and holes in pipe strings, and the like.<br>
Set-delayed cement compositions are often utilized in circumstances where an operator finds it desirable to prepare a volume of a cement composition that remains in a pumpable state for a long period of time (e.g., for about two weeks or more), and that can be selectively activated to set into a hard mass at a desired time. For example, in circumstances where very large volumes of cement are utilized (such as in offshore platform grouting), the equipment required for mixing and pumping the requisite large volumes of cement composition may be very expensive, and may be difficult to assemble at the desired location. The storage of the requisite amount of dry cement prior to use may be another problem. As another example, the use of a set-delayed cement composition may also be desirable in circumstances where a relatively small volume of cement composition is used, such as a small construction job, for example, or a plugging and squeezing operation performed in the petroleum industry, for instance. In such circumstances, the cost to transport the cement composition to a job site, and to mix and pump it on location may be undesirable relative to the revenue generated from performing<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
3-<br>
the cementing operation. Set-delayed cement compositions may be useful in circumstances such as those described above, as they can be prepared at a convenient location, then transported to and stored at a job site until use. At a desired time, the set-delayed cement composition may be mixed with a set activating agent; the resulting mixture may then be placed into a desired location (e.g., into a subterranean formation) and permitted to set therein. In some formulations, an excessive amount of set-activating agents have been injected into the set-delayed cement compositions, thereby "overactivating" the cement composition, after which a retarder is then added to the cement composition, in an attempt to fine-tune the eventual set time of the cement composition.<br>
Operations involving conventional set-delayed cement compositions may encounter a number of difficulties. For example, the cement composition may thicken or gel with time, increasing the cement composition's viscosity, and thus impairing its pumpability. Another difficulty is mat the activation process may be quite complicated, as exemplified by operations wherein the cement composition's set-time is first delayed until shortly before use, after which the cement composition is over-activated and again retarded<br>
Another problem that may occur with conventional set-delayed cement compositions is that the addition of set-activating agents may cause premature localized setting of the cement, e.g., localized regions within the bulk cement slurry wherein the set-activating agent becomes concentrated, thereby causing premature setting of a portion of the bulk cement Such premature localized setting of the cement composition may be likely to occur when the cement composition is inadequately mixed. Premature localized setting of the cement composition may lead to pumping problems (e.g., hardened cement particles may damage pump impellers), and may also cause problems such as setting of the bulk cement while in storage tanks.<br>
An additional difficulty posed by conventional set-delayed cement compositions is that the performance of the set-activating agents commonly used to selectively activate the cement compositions may be unpredictable. This may cause problems such as premature setting of the cement before placement (where the activating agent imparts an unexpectedly strong activating effect), or delayed setting of the cement after placement (where the activating agent imparts an unexpectedly weak activating effect). Both are undesirable.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to subterranean operations, and more particularly, to settable fluids comprising particle-size distribution-adjusting agents, and methods of using such settable fluids.<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
6<br>
The settable fluids of the present invention generally comprise a cement, water, a set retarder, and a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent. Optionally, other additives suitable for use in a settable fluid may be added. Generally, the settable fluids of the present invention have a density in the range of from about 4 to about 25 pounds per gallon In certain exemplary embodiments, the settable fluids of the present invention have a density in the range of from about 10 to about 25 pounds per gallon<br>
Any cements suitable for use in subterranean applications are suitable for use in the present invention Furthermore, any cements suitable for use in surface applications, e.g., construction cements, are suitable for use in the present invention In certain exemplary embodiments, the improved settable fluids of the present invention comprise a hydraulic cement A variety of hydraulic cements are suitable for use including those comprised of calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and/or sulfur, which set and harden by reaction with water. Such hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to, Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, high alumina content cements, silica cements, and high alkalinity cements.<br>
The water present in the settable fluids of the present invention may be from any source provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds that adversely affect other compounds in the settable fluids. For example, a settable fluid of the present invention can comprise fresh water, salt water (eg., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated salt water), or seawater. The water may be present in an amount sufficient to produce a pumpable slurry. Generally, the water is present in the settable fluids of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 25% to about 150% by weight of cement ("bwoc") therein. In certain exemplary embodiments, the water is present in the settable fluids of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 40% to about 55% bwoc therein.<br>
The particle-size distribution-adjusting agent in the settable fluids of the present invention may be any compound that desirably affects the particle-size distribution of the settable fluid such that the settable fluid's rheology remains desirably stable for a chosen period of time. Among other benefits, the presence of the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent in the settable fluids may forestall the onset of gelation for a desired period of time. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the settable fluids of the present invention are capable of remaining stable in a slurry state for several weeks or more<br><br>
WO2005/K8776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
7<br>
before being activated by the addition of an activator composition. Among other benefits,<br>
the presence of the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent in the settable fluid tends to<br>
cause smaller particles in the settable fluid to agglomerate, thereby tending to narrow the<br>
distribution range of the size of the particles in the settable fluid. One example of a<br>
suitable particle-size distribution-adjusting agent is a cationic polymer. Examples of<br>
cationic polymers suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited<br>
to,	cationic        polyacrylamides,        cationic        hydroxyethyl	cellulose,<br>
poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride), and cationic starches. In an exemplary embodiment, the cationic polymer used in the settable fluids of the present invention is a cationic starch. A commercially available example of a cationic starch is available under the tradename "REDDBOND 5330 A," from National Starch Co. of Bridgewater, Connecticut Generally, the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent may be present in the settable fluid in an amount sufficient to adjust the particle-size distribution of the settable fluid to a desired range. More particularly, the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent may be present in the settable fluid in an amount in the range of from about 0.01% to about 4% bwoc.<br>
The settable fluids of the present invention further comprise a set retarder. Generally, any set retarder may be used with the settable fluids of the present invention. In certain exemplary embodiments, the set retarders used in the present invention comprise phosphonic acid derivatives, such as those that are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,832, the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein. Commercially available examples of a suitable set retarder include those available from Monsanto Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri under the tradename "DEQUEST." In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a sodium salt of a phosphonic acid commercially available from Monsanto Corporation of St Louis, Missouri under the tradename "DEQUEST 2006" is used. Generally, the set retarder is present in the settable fluids of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 5% bwoc.<br>
Optionally, the settable fluids of the present invention may further comprise a yield stress reducing agent The use of such yield stress reducing agents may be particularly beneficial in certain exemplary embodiments where a densified settable fluid is used. Among other benefits, the use of a yield stress reducing agent may facilitate pumping of<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
8<br>
the densified settable fluid, inter alia, by reducing the force required to move the densified settable fluid from a static position. While the present invention is not limited by any particular theory, it is believed that the yield stress reducing agent, inter alia, increases the repulsive force between cement particles, thereby preventing them from approaching each other. An example of a suitable yield stress reducing agent is a sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate that is commercially available under the tradename "MELADYNE" from Handy Chemicals, Ltd., of Beachwood, Ohio. Another example of a suitable yield stress reducing agent is a sulfite adduct of an acetone formaldehyde condensate, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Oklahoma, under the tradename "CFR-3." Another example of a suitable yield stress reducing agent is a sulfonated naphthalene condensate, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Oklahoma, under the tradename "CFR-6." One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to identify a suitable yield stress reducing agent for a particular application.<br>
Optionally, the settable fluids of the present invention may further comprise an expanding additive. The expanding additive may be any component suitable for incorporating gas into the settable fluid. Where the expanding additive is a gas, gasification of the settable fluid may be achieved at the surface in one preferred embodiment, and the gasified settable fluid may be then introduced into the subterranean formation and permitted to set therein into a resilient, ductile, and tough gasified cement mass. Alternatively, the settable fluid may be gasified during, or after, its placement in the subterranean formation, by the inclusion of a particular expanding additive within the settable fluid. Where an expanding additive in particulate form is used, aluminum powder, gypsum blends, and deadburned magnesium oxide are preferred. Preferred expanding additives comprising aluminum powder are commercially available under the tradenames "GAS-CHEK®" and "SUPER CBL" from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Oklahoma; a preferred expanding additive comprising a blend containing gypsum is commercially available under the tradename 'MICROBOND" from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Oklahoma; and preferred expanding additives comprising deadburned magnesium oxide are commercially available under the tradenames "MICROBOND M" and "MICROBOND HT" from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Oklahoma. Such preferred expanding additives are described<br><br>
wu zmi3flN*776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
in commonly-owned U.S. Pat Nos. 4,304,298; 4,340,427; 4,367,093; 4,450,010; and 4,565,578, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to determine the appropriate amount of expanding additive to include in the settable fluids of the present invention for a particular application.<br>
Where the settable fluids of the present invention are to be foamed (e.g., to reduce the density of the settable fluid, or to improve its mechanical properties), the settable fluid is foamed in one exemplary embodiment by direct addition of the expanding additive into the settable fluid. For instance, where the settable fluid is foamed by the direct injection of gas into the composition, the gas utilized can be air or any suitable inert gas, such as nitrogen, or even a mixture of such gases. In certain exemplary embodiments, nitrogen is used Where foaming is achieved by direct injection of gas, the gas may be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to foam the composition, generally in an amount in the range of from about 0.01% to about 60% by volume of the composition. In another preferred embodiment, the settable fluid is foamed by gas generated by a reaction between the cement slurry and an expanding additive present in the settable fluid in particulate form. For example, the composition may be foamed by hydrogen gas generated in situ as the product of a reaction between die slurry and fine aluminum powder present in the settable fluid. To stabilize the foam, surfactants optionally may be added to the settable fluid. Surfactant compositions suitable for use in the present invention are described in U.S. Pat Nos. 6,063,738 and 6,367,550, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Additional additives may be added to the settable fluids of the present invention as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. Examples of such additives include, inter alia, fluid loss control additives, salts, vitrified shale, fly ash, fumed silica, bentonite, fixed-density weighting agents, and the like. An example of a suitable fluid loss control additive is commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Lie, of Duncan, Oklahoma, under the tradename "HALADI8&gt;9."<br>
To ready the settable fluids of the present invention for use (e.g., surface use, or placement in a subterranean formation, for example), an activator composition of the present invention may be added. The activator compositions of the present invention generally comprise a mixture of at least one alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
10<br>
a trialkanolamine. A wide variety of alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides are suitable for use in the present invention. In certain exemplary embodiments, me alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. A wide variety of trialkanolammes are suitable for use in the present invention. In certain exemplary embodiments, the triallcanolarnine is selected from the group consistmg of: triethanolamine ("TEA"), tripropanolamine, and triisopropanolamine. In certain exemplary embodiments, the trialkanolamine is TEA. Such combination has been found to provide a synergistic effect, resulting in settable fluids mat achieve desirably high compressive strengths at a faster rate than would be achieved had the TEA or alkali metal hydroxide been added individually. In certain exemplary embodiments, the alkali metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide. Generally, the activator composition may be added to a settable fluid of the present invention in an amount sufficient to enable the settable fluid to achieve a desired compressive strength and a desired thickening time. More particularly, the activator composition may be added to the settable fluid in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to 5% bwoc. Generally, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide may be present in the activator composition in an amount in the range of from about 50% to about 99.9% by weight Generally, the trialkanolamine may be present in the activator composition in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 50% by weight<br>
The activator composition may be added in a variety of ways. For example, the activator composition may be added to the settable fluid while the latter is still in storage. In certain other exemplary embodiments, the activator composition may be injected into the settable fluid at the same time that the settable fluid is injected into the subterranean formation. Among other benefits, the injection of the activator composition while the settable fluid is injected into the formation may assist in minimizing the development within the settable fluid of localized regions having a high activator concentration.<br>
In certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the settable fluid may be formulated as a "densified" settable fluid (e.g., formulated with a significantly higher density than that which is calculated to be necessary for its intended use) before the addition of the activator composition. Such a densified settable fluid may be provided in a variety of ways, such as through the addition of high-density particles, or by formulating the settable fluid with less water than necessary for its intended use. Among<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/0O53M<br>
11<br>
other benefits, me employment of a densified settable fluid will facilitate the addition of an activator composition m the form of a dilute solution. For example, if a settable fluid having a 16.4 lb/gallon density is required, a densified settable fluid having a density of, say, 17.0 lb/gallon or higher may be provided and activated with an activator composition diluted with sufficient water to ultimately provide the desired 16.4 lb/gallon slurry. Among other benefits, the addition of the activator composition in a dilute solution to a densified settable fluid may minimize the possibility of developing localized zones having excessive activator concentration due to inadequate mixing.<br>
In one embodiment of the methods of the present invention, the settable fluids of the present invention may be used as a drilling fluid. A drilling fluid of the present invention comprising a cement, a set retarder, and a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent may be used to drill a subterranean formation, e.g., by circulating the drilling fluid while drilling a well in contact with a drill bit and a subterranean formation. In an exemplary embodiment, the drilling fluid is used to drill a well bore in a subterranean formation, after which casing is placed within the well bore. In this exemplary embodiment, an activator composition of the present invention is men mixed with the drilling fluid, and the drilling fluid is permitted to set behind the casing. Accordingly, an exemplary method of the present invention comprises the step of drilling a well bore in a subterranean formation using a drilling fluid comprising a cement, a set retarder, and a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent Additional steps include, but are not limited to, placing a casing string within the well bore; mixing an activator composition of the present invention with the drilling fluid; and permitting the drilling fluid to set behind the casing string.<br>
In another embodiment, the settable fluids of the present invention may be used as a displacement fluid. For example, a displacement fluid of the present invention comprising a cement, a set retarder, a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent, and an activator composition of the present invention may be placed in a well bore that has been drilled (with a drilling fluid) in a subterranean formation so as to partially or completely displace the drilling fluid from the well bore. Generally, after the displacement fluid has been placed in the well bore, a cement composition is subsequently placed in the well bore so as to partially or completely displace the displacement fluid therefrom. Any portion of the displacement fluid that is not displaced by the cement composition, and that<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	12	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>
inadvertently remains within the well bore, will develop sufficient compressive strength so as not to adversely affect the integrity of the resultant cement sheath. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to determine the appropriate balance of set retarder and activator composition such that the displacement fluid will not set for a desired period of time, and will then develop compressive strength thereafter. Accordingly, an exemplary method of the present invention comprises the steps of: placing a displacement fluid comprising a cement, a set retarder, a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent, and an activator composition in a well bore in a subterranean formation so as to displace a second fluid therefrom. Additional steps include, but are not limited to, placing a casing string within the well bore; placing a cement composition within the well bore so as to displace at least a portion of the displacement fluid therefrom; permitting the cement composition to set therein; and permitting any undisplaced displacement fluid to set therein.<br>

The above example demonstrates, inter alia, that the settable fluids of the present invention comprising particle-size distribution-adjusting agents may maintain their original theological properties during a storage period of at least about two weeks.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Two sample settable fluids were prepared comprising Class H cement and water, such that the density of each settable fluid was 16.5 pounds per galloa A particle-size distribution-adjusting agent was then added to one sample settable fluid (Sample Composition No. 4). The particle size distribution of each sample composition was measured according to the following procedure. First, cement was added to a circulating stream of water, at which point the particle-size distribution of the mixture was measured. For Sample Composition No. 4, a known amount of the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent was then added to the circulating stream, and the particle-size distribution was again measured; additional amounts of the particle-size distribution-adjusting agent were added, and additional particle-size distribution measurements were taken, until no further change in particle size was observed.<br><br>
WO 2005/068776	PCT/GB2004/005311<br>

The particle sizes in the sample settable fluids were measured on a Malvern Particle Size Analyzer, available from Malvern Instruments Ltd., of Worcestershire, UK. For a given particle size, the Particle Size Analyzer identifies the volume percentage of particles in the sample that are beneath that particle size. The Particle Size Analyzer also provides a median particle size. Another parameter reported by the Particle Size Analyzer is the "Span," which describes the width of the distribution independent of the median particle size. The Particle Size Analyzer also reports the "Uniformity" of the particle-size distribution, which is a measure of the absolute deviation from the median particle size, and which is also independent of the median particle size. The lower the value reported for the Uniformity," the smaller the absolute deviation from the median particle size, and thus the more uniform the settable fluid<br>
Sample Composition No. 3 did not further comprise a particle-size distribution-adjusting agent<br>
Sample Composition No. 4, a settable fluid of the present invention, further comprised 0.233% bwoc of REDIBOND 5330 A.<br>
