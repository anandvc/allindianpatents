				<td>Process for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic ac1d derivatives, and a novel catalyst system for asymmetric transition metal catalysis<br>
The present invention relates to a process for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic ac1d derivatives, for instance alpha-substituted c1nnamic ac1d derivatives, to the corresponding chiral ac1ds or esters, and also a novel catalyst system with a spec1fic ligand system consisting of a chiral phosphorus ligand and an achiral phosphine ligand for asymmetric catalysis.<br>
Acrylic ac1d derivatives, for instance alpha-substituted c1nnamic ac1d derivatives, constitute valuable intermediates for the preparation of Pharmaceuticals, for instance for delta-amino-gamma-hydroxy-omega-arylalkanecarboxamides, which have renin-inhibiting properties and can be used as an ant ihyper tensive in pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Catalysts, and also processes for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations of unsaturated compounds, have already been described in the literature.<br>
For example, WO 02/0250-0 states that the asymmetric hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic ac1ds with homogeneous, asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts is known per se and that spec1fically ruthenium and rhodium catalysts are very effective therefor. The ligands used are chiral di-tertiary diphoaphines. With these systems, it is possible according to WO 02/02500 to attain optical yields of up to 80% ee. As an improvement to these catalysts, WO 02/02500 proposes the use of a bidentate ligand with a ferrocenyl basic structure.<br>
Adv. Synth. Catal. 2003, 345, p. 160-164 discloses further diphoBphine ligands based on a ferrocenyl-aryl basic structure, known as the walphos ligand family, which are used in the rhodium- or ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins and ketones. The walphos iigands are used in combination with a ruthenium or a rhodium source, for instance Ru( methyl allyl)2COD, [ (NBD) 2Rh] BF4 or [ (COD) 2Rh] BF4, for example for the hydrogenation of c1nnamic ac1d derivatives, in which optical purities of up to 95% ee are achieved.<br>
A disadvantage in this process is in particular the high costs of the walphos ligand, since the synthesis of the ligand is distinctly more complicated. WO 02/04466 discloses further catalysts which have a monodentate ligand. However, it has been found that the monophos catalyst systems described therein are less active for c1nnamic ac1d derivatives in particular, as a result of which longer hydrogenation times are required, and lead to poorer enantiomeric excesses. WO 2004/03520B describes mixtures of monophosphorus compounds as ligand systems for asymmetric transition metal catalysis. It is known from Example 8 of the application that a mixture of chiral phosphonite or phosphite ligands and an achiral monophosphorus ligand leads to distinctly poorer results with regard to optical purity than when a mixture of chiral monophosphorus compounds is used.<br>
Since there is still a great need for improved processes with improved catalyst systems in the field of asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic ac1d derivatives, it is an object of the present invention to find a process for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic ac1d derivatives, and also a novel catalyst system which enables, in a simple, inexpensive manner, the preparation of the desired compoundB in optical purities, higher compared<br>
to the prior art, of up to 100% ee, and in higher yields of up to 100% of theory.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for transition ,metal-catalyzed, asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic ac1d derivatives of the formula (I)<br>
in which Rl is H or an optionally substituted -alkyl, -aryi or -heteroaryl radical, R2 is an optionally substituted.lkyl, C5-C2o-aryl or -heteroaryl radical, and R3 is H or. a d-C6-alkyl radical, which comprises hydrogenating compounds of the formula (I), <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
optionally in a solvent, in the presence of one or more H donors, using a catalyst system which comprises a transition metal from the group of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium and a combination of a chiral phosphorus ligand of the formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Cn, together with the two oxygen atoms and the phosphorus atom, forms an optionally substituted ring having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and R4 is an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy radical or NR5R6 where R5 and R6 may each independently be H or an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl radical, or, together with the nitrogen atom, may form a ring, and an achiral phosphine ligand of the formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R is an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl radical, to the corresponding compounds of the formula (IV)<br>
in which Rl, R2 and R3 are each as defined above.<br>
The substrates used are acrylic ac1d derivatives of the formula (I) in which Rl is H or an optionally substituted C1-C20-alkyl radical or an optionally substituted C5-C20-aryl or C5-C20-heteroaryl radical, and R2 is an optionally substituted C1-C20-alkyl radical or an optionally substituted C5-C20-aryl or C5-C20-heteroaryl radical.<br>
Alkyl radicals should be understood to mean linear, branched or cyclic alkyl radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, where the alkyl chain may optionally contain one or more double or triple bonds or may be interrupted by one or more heteroatoms from the group of N, 0 and S.<br>

The inventive catalyst system can be prepared analogously to WO 02/04466.<br>
Preference is given to reacting the chiral ligand and<br>
the achiral ligand with a catalyst precursor comprising<br>
the transition metal.<br>
Examples of suitable catalyst precursors are: (COD = 1, 5-cyclooctadiene, NBD = norbornadiene) [Rh(COD)2Cl]2, [Rh(COD)2]BF4, [Rh (NBD) 2] BF4, Ru(OAc)3,<br>

is from 100:1 to 1 000 OOO-.l, preferably from 1000:1 to<br>

In the process according to the invention, for example, the substrate of the formula (I) , the ligands of the formulae (II) and (III) , and the precursor which comprises the transition metal are dissolved in the solvent in a suitable apparatus, for instance in an autoclave. Then, the apparatus is preferably purged with inert gas, for example with N2/ if the exclusion<br>
of oxygen is desired. Then, rhe mixture is heated to the desired reaction temperature. However, preferably only -he substrate is dissolved first in the solvent, then the apparatus is purged, preferably with inert gas. After heating to the appropriate reaction temperature, a suspension of the ligands of the formula<br>
(II)	and  (III)  in degassed solvent and  also  the<br>
precursor which comprises the transition metal are then<br>
charged to the substrate solution.<br>
Afterward, the hydrogen donor is added at the appropriate reaction temperature. Preference is given to injecting H2 to the desired pressure. After the reaction has ended and the reaction solution has optionally been cooled, the desired end product is isolated by customary methods depending on the state of matter.<br>
It is also possible first to prepare the catalyst complex, for example by reacting the ligands (II) and<br>
(III)	with a precursor in a degassed solvent at room<br>
temperature, by stirring the reaction mixture for a<br>
certain time. Subsequently, the volatile compounds are<br>
distilled off to obtain a solid catalyst complex which<br>
is then added to the substrate solution.<br>
The process according to the invention and in particular the use of the spec1fic catalyst system make it possible to hydrogenate the acrylic ac1d derivatives firstly in a substantially less expensive manner compared to the prior art and secondly in distinctly higher enantioselectively, as a result of which the end products have a distinctly higher optical purity.<br>
The present invention further provides a catalyst system for asymmetric transition metal catalysis, which comprises a transition metal from group VIII, IX or X and a combination of a chiral phosphorus ligand of the formula (Ha) , (lib) , (lie) or (lid) and an achiral phosphine ligand of the formula (III)<br>
in which R is an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl<br>
The inventive catalyst system is suitable for asymmetric transition metal catalysis, in particular for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsarurated compounds.<br>
The ratio of chiral ligand of the formulae (Ha) - (lid) to achiral ligand of the formula (III) may in this case be from 10:1 to 1:5.<br>
The ratio is preferably from 5:1 to 1:2, more preferably from 2.5:1 to 1.2:1.<br>
Suitable transition metals are elements of groups VIII, IX or X; preference is given to using ruthenium, rhodium or iridium.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the inventive catalyst system for the transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds.<br>

The autoclave was purged 5x with N2 and heated to 55°C. Afterward, it was purged 3x with H2 and subsequently pressurized  to  80 bar of  H2  without  stirring.  At 80 bar/55°C and 100 rptr. of the stirrer, the mixture was then hydrogenated overnight. After 18 h, the autoclave was cooled and the desired product was isolated. Yield: 50,35 g (96.6% of theory) Optical purity: 95.3% ee<br>
