COMPLETE SPECIFCATION <br>
(Section   10;   Rule   13)<br>
1)   "A FUEL SAVING DEVICE/",<br>
2) ME, UDAY J. KARANDIKAR<br>
(Indian	National)    having<br>
address      at 4/295, Old Belapur<br>
.Road,      Ganpaiipada,      Vitawa,<br>
Thane - 400 605, INDIA.<br>
The following specification describes and  ascsrtains the nature  of the invention &amp; the maimer ia which, it is performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a fuel saving device.<br>
Conventionally, a number of systems are available for the purpose of saving fuel. These systems are either imported or assembled in India.. These conventional systems use bipolar magnetic systems, that is, both north and south poles are used. The magnets used are feron type neodymiuni bars.<br>
However, the conventional systems used have several disadvantages, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
Complete oxidation of the molecules of fuel does not take place since the entire surface area of molecules is not exposed for oxidation. Due to this, the fuel is not used completely on account of which not much fuel is saved. This decreases the efficiency of the conventional fuel saving systems.<br>
Secondly, the Neodymium bar magnets used have magnetic properties which are not effective above 80"' C, In a tropical country like India, where summer temperatures reach around 40° C, engine temperatures rise almost upto 110' 0 to 120"' C. Under such circumstances, the conventional fuel savers become completely ineffective.<br>
The present invention has been developed with a goal to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional fuel saving systems and provide a better alternative.<br>
The principal objective of the present invention is to generate extra power using -the same amount of fuel and tkm save fuel.<br>
The second objective is to increase the life of the gas burners and vehicle engines to which it is attached.<br><br>
Anothsr objective is that the device should be stable and effective at high temperatures (that is, above 80° C).<br>
The present invention will now be explained in detail with the help of figure I of accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 shows the assembly drawing (Model RM for Rickshaws and Motorbikes) of the present invention, It illustrates assembly sealing plate (1). glass filled nylon alloy assembly mounting (2), Barium Tiianate Multiaxial (BTMA) Resonator Mounting Space (3), Barium Titanate Multiaxial (BTMA) Resonators (4), Field Concentrator (5), V-groove for fuel tube (6) and clamping screws (?).<br>
The present invention has been developed using the Barium Titanate Multiaxial Resonance Theory. According to this theory, when fuel molecules of Hydro-carbon are deciusisred and exposed to a multiaxial field, nuclear spin resonance is generated in the molecules. This makes them spin around their own axis. The spinning caused in the fuel molecules exposes the entire surface area of every molecule to the atmospheric oxygen during the combustion process, leading to complete oxidation. Thus complete combustion of all the individual molecules takes place and the unexposed area which could be as high as 38% is made fully available for oxidation.<br>
The construction of the present invention 'Purosaver Fuel Savers' is explained below.<br>
The present invention uses Monopolar assembly of BTMA Resonators mounted on Glass Filled Nylon Alloy Mounting. The Monopolar Resonator assembly consists of multiaxial mounting spaced apart at a certain distance for achieving nuclear resonance spin of hydrocarbon molecules. They are also fitted with field concentrators on the side of fuel line to enhance and concentrate the field available for resonance.<br><br>
For models upto 600 c,c. (Model RM), the miit contains 3 slots with one resonator blank followed by one resonator filled with field concentrator alternating with opposite slots.<br>
For models for 600 c.c. to 3000 c.c. (Mode! CL), the unit contains 4 slots -with one resonator blank and one filled alternating with opposite slots.<br>
Whereas, for models for 3000 c.c. and above (Model BT), the unit contains 5<br>
slots with one resonator blank and one filled alternating with opposite slots.<br>
The above arrangement creates a node for resonance in the fuel molecules, transferring maximum energy for dechistsring making.all the available molecular surface area accessible for complete oxidation.<br>
The present invention 'Purosaver Fuel savers has many advantages over conventionally suitable fuel saving systems, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
Due to the use of Barium Titanate Multiaxiii Resonance Theory which generates nuclear spin resonance in the declustered Hydrocarbon molecules, complete combustion of all individual molecules takes place and the unexposed area which could be as high as 38% is made fully available for oxidation. Thus using the same amount of fuel, upto 25% extra power is generated for all practical purposes, although theoretically 38% is the upper limit. This power is made available either in the form of extra heat (Thermal energy) in case of gas burners / fuel burners or extra distance travelled in case of IC engines of vehicles. Thus life of gas cylinders is increased upto 25% and vehicles will give upto 25% extra mileage using the same amount of fuel.<br>
Secondly, in the present invention, the Monopolar Resonator assembly is mounted in glass filled nylon alloy polymer which will be stable upto 175° C. The assembly itself retains its properties upto 350° C. This makes the present invention much more stable and effective in all seasonal conditions even at high<br><br>
I CLAIM  ;<br>
