				<td>MEDIUM TIME ALLOCATION AND SCHEDULING USING ISO-ZONE STRUCTURED SUPERFRAME FOR QOS PROVISIONING IN WIRELESS<br>
NETWORKS<br>
This Application claims the benefit of priority from prior US application 60/674,495, filed April 25, 2005, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The wireless communication bandwidth has significantly increased with advances of channel modulation techniques, making the wireless medium a viable alternative to wired and optical fiber solutions. As such, the use of wireless connectivity in data and voice communications continues to increase. These devices include mobile telephones, portable computers in wireless networks (e.g., wireless local area networks (WLANS), as well as audio/visual streaming, video/audio telephony, stationary computers in wireless networks, and portable handsets, to name only a few.<br>
Each wireless network includes a number of layers and sub-layers, such as the Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer and the Physical (PHY) layer. The MAC layer is the lower of two sublayers of the Data Link layer in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) stack. The MAC layer provides coordination between many users that require simultaneous access to the same wireless medium.<br>
The MAC layer protocol includes a number of rules governing the access to the broadcast medium that is shared by the users within the network. As is known, several different multiple access technologies (often referred to as MAC protocols) have been defined to work withm the protocols that govern the MAC layer. These include, but are not limited, to Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (CSMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA).<br>
While standards and protocols have provided for significant improvement in the control of voice and data traffic, the continued increase in the demand for network access at increased channel rates while supporting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements have required a continuous evaluation of protocols and standards and changes thereto. For example, many known protocols such as the WiMedia Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) MAC 1.0 (published as ECMA standard 368) and other non-slot based WLANs such as IEEE 802.11, require that QoS requirements from applications are passed down to lower layers of networking stack based on the Traffic Specifications (TSPEC) of the application stream.<br>
 <br>
upon receiving the TSPEC of the application stream, lower layers such as the MAC allocate resource to serve the traffic stream to meet the QoS requirements. In various MAC protocols, one such resource is the airtime available for transmission of data or other information. QoS provisioning in these wireless MAC protocols usually involves allocation of airtime according to a QoS requirement specified, for example, in the TSPEC. For example, in slot-based MAC protocol, such as the WiMedia UWB MAC, there are various ways to allocate media access slot (MAS) (e.g., medium access time) that result in performance differences in delay, power saving, etc.<br>
Allocation of contiguous blocks of airtime for data or airtime transmission can lead to large maximum service intervals for an application stream. This may result in a large delay bound where large blocks of contiguous MAS blocks other applications from meeting their low-latency requirements. Additionally, too many smaller distributed fragments of time allocation over the course of a superframe may also not enable successful transmission of an entire packet.<br>
What is needed, therefore, is a method and system that substantially overcomes at least the shortcomings of known methods described.<br>
In accordance with an example aspect, a method of transmitting information over a wireless network includes the steps of: organizing the superframe into a plurality of allocation zones; organizing the allocation zones into iso-zones; generating an allocation map; determining a periodic service interval based on a TSPEC, a delay requirement, and local resource of an application stream; determining a medium time requirement based on the TSPEC, the delay requirement, and local resource of an application stream; searching for transmission opportunity that accommodates the periodic service interval and the medium time required based on the allocation map; transmitting information in the superframe upon finding transmission opportunity in the searching step.<br>
The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawing figures. It is emphasized that the various features are not necessarily drawn to scale. In fact, the dimensions may be arbitrarily increased or decreased for clarity of discussion.<br>

In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, example embodiments disclosing specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure that other embodiments that depart from the specific details disclosed herein. Moreover, descriptions of well-known devices, methods, systems and protocols may be omitted so as to not obscure the description of the present invention. Nonetheless, such devices, methods, systems and protocols that are within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art may be used in accordance with the example embodiments. Finally, wherever practical, like reference numerals refer to like features.<br>
Briefly, in accordance with illustrative embodiments, methods and system are described that improve the efficiency and throughput in a distributed wireless network. The methods and system calculate the maximum service interval that will meet the delay requirement and TSPEC of one or more application streams. This is accomplished, for example, by allocating contiguous MAS (i.e., portions of media access time) to minimize power loss due to numerous "wake-up" operations.<br>
In accordance with the example embodiments described herein, distributed (i.e., slot-based) wireless networks operate under WiMedia MAC 1.0. Of course, this is merely illustrative, and other MAC protocols may incorporate the sharing of availability of the devices within the network that are described in connection with the example embodiments. These include, but are not limited to, the progeny of the current WiMedia MAC protocol, as well as other carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols. Additionally, the embodiments described herein may also apply to WLANs having non-<br>
 <br>
<br>
slot based media access, such as IEEE 802.11 WLAN. It is emphasized that these protocols are merely illustrative and that other protocols within purview of one of ordinary skill in the art may be implemented in accordance with the example embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a wireless network system that includes plurality of wireless devices or systems sharing a communications medium (i.e., co-existing) in accordance with an example embodiment.   Wireless devices/systems 101 may transmit or receive (or both) traffic 104 to from other wireless devices 101 within their transmission • range 102. Moreover, there may be other wireless devices/systems 103 that are outside the range 102 of certain wireless devices/systems 101, but within the range of certain devices lO1' .   Wireless devices 101 contain a transceiver 110 (e.g., any known transmitter/receiver combination, or a separate transmitter and receiver), a processors 111 (e.g., any known device which processes bits of information), and a power source 112 (e.g., a battery).<br>
Fig. 2 is a time line 200 of a superframe between a first beacon 201 and a second beacon 202. As used herein, the starting point of the beacons is referred to as the Beacon Period Start Time (BPST), and there is a prescribed period of time between beacons. In an example embodiment, the superframe is divided into a plurality of medium access slots (MAS) 203, which provide for organized transmission and reception in keeping with the example embodiments. In an illustrative embodiment, there are 256 slots 203, with each slot having a duration of approximately 256 us, so the entire duration of the superframe is approximately 65.536 ms in the example embodiment (thus 65.536 ms between BPSTs). Of course the number and duration of the slots 203 is merely for purposes of illustration and are in no way limitations of the slots 203.<br>
At the beginning of each superframe there is a beacon interval 204. As will become clearer as the present description continues, the beacon interval 204 provide the vehicle for the sharing of availability information of the devices/systems (e.g., devices 101,103)of the network 100, as well as the needs of devices/systems to send traffic to other devices/systems of the wireless network 100 of the example embodiments.<br>
After the beacon interval 204 is a service interval 206. Each service interval comprises a certain number of slots.  Different application streams require different numbers of slots 203 to ensure adequate medium access for complete packet transmission. A processor in a transmitter determines how much of the service interval it requires to transmit its data packets. This determination occurs by analyzing the bandwidth<br>
 <br>
requirement, delay requirement, and TSPEC of the application stream. Additionally, service intervals are periodic (i.e., occurring over several cycles of beacon interval 204 and service interval 206).<br>
To calculate the periodic service interval, a processor (e.g., processor 111 in Fig. 1) calculates a service rate g according to a TSPEC and local resource, such as buffer size. Local resource may also be, for example, medium time and buffer space required by a transmitter to transmit its data within the MAC in which it operates. The processor also calculates the queuing delay dq caused by burst size of the application stream by using the calculated g. The maximum service interval 206 can be calculated by based on the delay requirement For example, slot-based media access mechanisms such as WiMedia UWB can be calculated as follows:<br>
Sl<ds-dg where ds is the delay requirement and dq additional queuing caused by burst size of application stream.></ds-dg>
Fig. 3 depicts a two-dimensional representation of superframe 200. The y-axis of the representation is MAS increasing sequentially in the downward direction for slot based systems such as UWB or transmission opportunity space for non-slot-based systems such as IEEE 802.11. The x-axis of the representation is allocation zone that increases sequentially in the horizontal direction (i.e., from left to right on the figure).   Allocation zones 1-15 represent a contiguous grouping of transmission opportunity, for example, MAS. Sequentially in time, MAS where x = 2 and y =1 follows MAS where x =1 and y =15. According to the prior art, incoming application streams were pre-assigned either a high-efficiency scheme or a low-latency scheme, depending on QoS requirements of the MAC and the application scheme requirements. In a low-latency scheme, data transmission occurs exclusively in MAS slots (e.g., row components) where x = 1, y =15; x =2, y = 15,..., x = 15, y = 15. 4. For a high-efficiency scheme, contiguous MAS blocks are utilized.<br>
In order that MAS are allocated accounting for both application service interval requirements as well as reservations of contiguous blocks of MAS, iso-zones 301-304 may be organized to parse out transmission opportunity in an efficient manner.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a method for parsing a superframe into allocation zones 1-15. For non-slot based systems, first, in step 401, an application determines the minimum service<br>
 <br>
interval the wireless network can accommodate according to the formula discussed above. The application then divides a beacon period of the superframe by the minimum service interval to generate a value x in step 402. The number of allocation zones n within a superframe can be calculated in step 403 based on the formula<br>
wherein the formula returns the smallest integer that is greater or equal to x.  Thus the number of allocation zones depends on the beacon interval and the minimum service interval of the existing applications, or the types of applications the QoS access point (QAP) intends to support.    The number of allocation zones n will be the smallest power of 2 greater or equal to the product of the beacon period and the service interval.<br>
For slot-based systems such as UWB, an application can divide a superframe into allocation zones by dividing (402) the superframe into 2m allocation zones, where m = (1,2,3,...). This ensures an even number of allocation zones which can be parsed out for transmission opportunity. For example, the WiMedia UWB MAC 1.0 calls for a 256 MAS superframe structured into 16 allocation zones (e.g., the x-axis of Fig. 3) and 16 row components (e.g., the y-axis of Fig. 3).<br>
Regardless of whether the wireless transmission opportunity is slot-based or not, its superframe can be organized into a number of allocation zones n which is a power of 2.<br>
Once the superframe is parsed into allocation zones, in order to efficiently account for both application service interval requirements as well as reservations of contiguous blocks of transmission opportunity, the allocation zones are organized into iso-zones each having an index value. The iso-zones have periodical service intervals that are portions of allocation zone duration. Fig. 3 depicts iso-zones with index values of 3,2,1, and 0.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts a flow chard diagram for organizing a superframe's allocation zones into iso-zones. In step 501, an application marks a first allocation zone with an iso-zone index value equal to m-1.   This can be allocation zone 1 in Fig. 3. In step 502, the application decrements the iso-zone index value by 1 and marks a second subsequent allocation zone with the decremented iso-zone index value. This can be allocation zone 2 in Fig. 3 which is assigned iso-zone index value 2. The application then mirrors the first allocation zone in a third allocation zone subsequent to the second allocation zone in step 503.   An example of this mirroring is to assign allocation zone 3 in Fig. 3 with the same iso-zone index value as allocation zone 1.   The mirroring refers to a mirror image iso-zone<br>
 <br>
index values for the allocation zones 1 and 3 on opposite sides of allocation zone 2 in Fig.<br>
3.<br>
In step 504, the process repeats whereby the steps of decrementing, marking, and mirroring continue. For example, in Fig. 3, allocation zone 4 is assigned an iso-zone index value of 1 which is a decremented value. Then allocation zone 1 is used for the mirroring step and allocation zones 5, 6, and 7 are marked with the iso-zone index values of allocation zones 3,2, and 1 respectively.  Marking need not be physical marking. Marking may be assigning a bit indicating the iso-zone value index of a particular allocation zone. This process continues until step 505 determines that the marking step marks an allocation zone with an iso-zone index value equal to 0. hi Fig. 3, this is allocation zone 8. This is the midpoint of the superframe (without considering the beacon zone in allocation zone 0). The application then performs an additional iteration of mirroring and marking in step 506. For example, once allocation zone 8 in Fig. 3 is marked with an iso-zone index value 0, mirroring takes place by marking allocation zones 9 through 15 with the iso-zone indsx values of allocation zones 7 through 1, respectively.<br>
Table 1 depicts an allocation map where the index, the number of zones, the number of allocation zones and which allocation zone contains which iso-zone index values:<br>
 <br>
Once an allocation map is created, an application can search for transmission opportunity within a superframe.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 6 depicts the method for transmission of information over a wireless network. In step 601, an application organizes a superframe into a plurality of allocation zones as recited above. In step 602, the application organizing the allocation zones into iso-zones as recited above. In step 603, the application generates an allocation map (for example, table 1). In step 604, the application determines a periodic service interval based on a TSPEC, a delay requirement, and local resource of an application stream as recited above. In step<br>
605,	the application determines its medium time requirement based on the TSPEC, the delay requirement, and local resource of an application stream as recited above. In step<br>
606,	the application searches for transmission opportunity that accommodates the periodic service interval and the medium time required based on the allocation map. Once the application detects there is transmission opportunity available that satisfies its period service interval and medium time tequirements, it transmits infonnation in the superframe in step 607.<br>
The search step 606 searches in ascending order from the lowest iso-zone index value for transmission opportunity for high-efficiency QoS requirements of an application.<br>
Step 606 of searching for transmission opportunity includes calculating a number of allocation zones k corresponding to service interval requirements using the formula<br>
BP' k=  —   for low latency QoS requirements.<br>
Then, the application determines a starting iso-index value from which the searching should begin equal to ]~llogj(r~|. The searching starts in ascending order from the starting<br>
iso-zone index value for transmission opportunity compliant with low latency requirements of an application.<br>
Given the properties described above, the following principles maximize the size of contiguous unallocated medium time, and hence maximize the chance to meet requirement for incoming QoS requests and meanwhile satisfying the delay requirement of current request<br>
(a)	Optimal schedules are the ones that always start with the lower-indexed iso-zone before scheduling in higher-indexed iso-zones.<br>
(b)	Optimal schedules are the ones that keep current allocation as flat as possible within each iso-zone. This actually indicates the following generalized Evenly Distributed MAS policy (EDMA) within each iso-zone in slot based medium<br>
 <br>
access. i.e., each iso-zone allocation should not allocate more than n/k+l MAS in each allocation zone within an iso-zone, where k is the number of allocation zones that the schedule is taking within the iso-zone under consideration.<br>
Additional allocation maps (a.k.a, look-up) tables (with n=16 and 32) are shown in 2-Table 4.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 7 depicts an iso-2xme structure with a partially occupied beacon zone. The iso-zone structure formed this way has the following properties:<br>
1. Iso-zone i comprises 2' allocation zones<br>
2. Since 2" -1 = ^2', the iso-zone structure is therefore conq)lete in the sense that<br>
the superframe is completely covered by m iso-zones formed this way without any missing allocation zones, nor overlapping.<br>
3-    SI(k)  z; where SI(i) denotes the native service interval that iso-zonc i supports. This property indicates that if iso-zone(i) meets the application's delay requirement, so will iso-zone(k), Vk&gt;i.<br>
4. SI((kji})  i; where 5y({fc,z}) denotes the maximum service interval<br>
achieved hy allocation in iso-zone i in additional to iso-zone k. This property indicates that if iso-zone k meets the plication's delay requirement, additional allocation in any iso-zone(s) will not increase the worst-case delay.<br>
5. Native service interval of iso-zone i can be achieved m iso-zone k, Vik &gt; i;<br>
Example Aljgorithm for hipb-efficiency OoS requirements:<br>
At the stage of determining the location of medium time, high-efSciency-low-power QoS requirements are already interpreted as the number of allocation zones n(e) (that is a function of efficiency factor e) in addition to bandwidth requirement in the form of medium time duration/or size t(g) (that is a function of service rate g). Given the requirement input of {t(g), n(e)}, the following algorithm maximizing the probability of satisfying the QoS requests for succeeding allocations while minimizing the number of allocation zones that the schedule takes to allocate medium time t(g):<br>
2. If (n &gt; t(g)), allocate t(g) according to policy (a) starting with iso-zone 0;<br>
3. Within each iso-zone, follow policy (b)<br>
4. Otherwise, report error of insufficient medium time.<br>
For non-slot based systems such as IEEE 802.11, once the location is determined, the<br>
scheduler that resides in a QAP or QSTA may schedule the traffic stream according the location determined this way together with the duration determined by algorithms/mechanisms<br>
