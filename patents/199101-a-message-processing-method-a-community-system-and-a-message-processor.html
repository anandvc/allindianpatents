				<td>This invention relates to a data processing technique, and more particularly, to an improved data processing method for supporting communications among two or more nodes on a network in a distributed computer environment.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
There is a mobile agent technology in the art in which an internal condition is moved as it is to a place which is provided in a server existing on a network in a distributed computer environment to form an instruction in the place where it moved to. Reference is made to USP 5,603,031(PUPA 7-182174) and Fumihiko Nishida , Susumu Fujiwara et al's "Latest Internet Technology, special edition of Nikkei Communication", pp 104-117, Nikkei BP.<br>
Such mobile agent makes a contact to other agents in the moved-to place (a mobile agent or a resident agent) and may be served as appropriate. A place is a location provided by a server existing on the network to which the agent moved and which supports a contact among agents and absorbs the differences between the hardwares and between the platforms.<br>
The mobile agent technology enables a mobile agent to act as a proxy of a human being in handling jobs such as<br><br>
*&gt;c9<br>
dynamically adjusting a schedule of internal meetings in compliance with the schedule of attendees and status of reservation of conference rooms and acquiring desired information distributed on the network.<br><br>
In a prior art system which makes a contact between agents, a mobile agent 101 or a resident agent 103 (a general agent which requests a service is called a regular agent hereinafter), in requesting a service to a service provider agents 131,133 which have an ability to provide a service, inquires a facilitator agent 110 which maintans an agent community 150 residing in that place of a service provider agents 131,133 which have an ability of providing a service, and makes a contact to the service provider agents 131,133 based on the information obtained from the inquiry.<br>
However, because the agent residing in such agent community 150 was registered in and maintained by the facilitator agent 110 in a form unique to each service provider agent, regular agents 101, 103 which desired to receive a service had to find service provider agents 131,133 having an ability to provide its own service from a list of agents which was received from the facilitator agent 110.<br><br>
Also, the regular agents 101,103 had to inquire for each service provider that corresponds to respective service provider agents 131,133 from which the service is re-<br><br>
-JA9-9? ceived.<br>
Further, the regular agents 101,103 had to control themselves even in a stereotype processing and check the content and combination of a requests depending on what request was directed to what service provider.<br>
The regular agent had to build a desired process result based on the process result they received from each service provider.<br>
[0010].<br>
Furthermore, it was necessary to expand functions of the facilitator agent 110, maintain the facilitator agent 110 itself when attempting expansion of the service and halting the service in installation.<br>
[Objectives of the Invention]<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a communi¬cation system which is capable of dealing with inquiries from agents flexibly, suitably and in a high speed.<br>
[0012}<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a communication system which reduces the amount of load born by users of agents.<br><br>
JA9=97<br>
40013*<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a communication system which absorbs the difference between service provider agents.<br>
"f0014]<br>
It is still another object of this invention to provide a communication system which enables a desired process result to be built based on a plurality of different process results received from each service provider agent.<br>
[00151<br>
It is still further object of this invention to provide a communication system which enables a high speed opera¬tion by distributing tasks.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a communication system which is highly expandable by dynamically installing various agents.<br>
f
It is still further object of this invention to reduce the work and the time required for developing and main¬taining a program as much as possible in providing a support to communication among agents.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a<br><br>
&amp;&amp;<br>
communication system which is capable of flexibly dealing with  conversations among agents.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a message processing system which gives less load to a communication network.<br>

[Solution of the Objectives]<br>
In this invention, a plurality of different broker agents such as 121,123 are provided which are customized to problem areas for processing, such as distributing and integrating tasks which are the requests from regular agents. The broker agents 121,123 inquire the facilitator agent 110, receive a list of service provider agents 131,133 which are relevant to their own jobs, and retain the list. The broker agent 121 which receives a message packet requesting a mediation of a job from the regular agent 101 determines the outline of the requested job by analyzing the message packet and sends it to a service provider agent which retains it as a list after certain conversion. The broker agent 121 receives a reply from the service provider agents 131,133 and transmits it to the regular agent 101 after certain conversion.<br>

Fig.4 schematically shows an operational condition in the preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>
In Fig.4, each service provider agent 131,133,135 reports to the facilitator agent 110 of a capability, name and address each owns upon installation into the agent community 150 and the reported information is stored in the facilitator advertise table 151.<br><br>

Fig.5 schematically shows a facilitator advertise table 151 and a broker advertise table 141. The facilitator advertise table 151 holds message packets sent from agents which are maintained by the facilitator agent 110(service provider agent, broker agent, regular agent, etc.) as shown in the figure.<br>
Included in each advertise message packet are; a message type 301 such as "broker-all" which the agent can pro¬cess, a describing language type 311 such as "anACL" which is understandable to the agent, a classification information of the capabilities owned by the agent such as the type of interpreter which the agent owns(ontology 313) and the type of service which the agent provides, like "travel", and an agent specifying information including an agent name like "airlineA", an address information to get an access to the agent like "www.airlineA", and a class name to start the agent like "airline-reservation".<br>

Other agents existing in the agent community 150 can point to a service provider agent which has a desired capability with reference to the facilitator advertise table 151 to send a request to process.<br>
The travel broker agent 121 extracts a service provider agent involved in the job it takes with reference to the facilitator advertise table 151 to generate a broker<br><br>
JA9 97 107-<br>
advertise table 141 which has a structure similar to the facilitator advertise table 151.<br>
The difference between the facilitator advertise table 151 and the broker advertise table 141 in the preferred embodiment of this invention lies only in that a service provider agent in which a control object coincides a condition including a predetermined category, describing language and ontology is extracted. Because the broker advertise table 141 extracts only a specific classifica¬tion information(ontology only, category only, message type + subcategory + describing language, etc.)to which the service provider agent holding that table refers so that the broker advertise table only needs to control a minimum information required to get access to the corre¬sponding service provider agent, it may be controlled as a table which has a different structure from the facili¬tator advertise table 151.<br>
Further, with a provision of an advertise table which is exactly the same as the facilitator advertise table 151, a service provider agent which meets a predetermined condition may be searched each time a process request is received from a regular agent. In the preferred embodi¬ment of this invention, because the broker agent asks the facilitator agent 110 to forward a process request to a service provider agent having a predetermined condition or to introduce a service provider agent having a prede¬termined condition each time it receives a process request from a regular agent, it does not retain the broker advertise table 141.<br><br>
£Q#W<br>
Fig.6 is an object interaction diagram showing steps of registering service provider agent in the broker adver¬tise table 141 by accessing to a facilitator agent.<br>
At first, the travel broker agent 121 registers "its own name(object name)", "the place it is(URL,etc.)", and "its own class name" in a life cycle control mechanism of the facilitator agent 110.<br>
[0000]<br>
Next, the travel broker agent 121 requests the facilita¬tor agent 110 to introduce an agent (the facilitator agent itself in this case) who registers a category, subcategory, class name and agent name in the facilitator advertise table 151.<br>
-[0001]<br>
The facilitator agent 110 searches a record which was advertised prior to the request and, in finding an agent which matches the condition, generates a message packet having that advertise record as a content for return to the broker agent.<br>
Because the broker agent 121 knows that the answer is the facilitator agent 110 itself, it throws a message packet of insert to the facilitator agent 110 and let it enter the information of the agent 121 in the database which is held by the facilitator agent 110.<br><br>
J**<br><br>
The travel broker agent 121 then advertises its capabili¬ty, i.e., expresses that "can answer that it throws a message in the form of broker-all(ask-all(:ontology = Travel, :content = (flight...))) to itself".<br>
[004]<br>
The travel broker agent 121 tells the facilitator agent 110 "introduce(recommend-one) an agent who can subscribe ask-all to an agent who has information : flight in the content with YellowPage ontology".<br><br>
Because the travel broker agent 121 knows that the facilitator agent 110 has the capability from the answer returned therefrom, it throws to the facilitator agent 110 "subscribe(ask-all(:ontology= YellowPage, : con¬tent (: flight...)))".<br><br>
Because there is no advertise record that matches this query presently, the content of the tell answer is nothing. For subscribe, one tell is immediately returned to notify the current status of the facilitator advertise table 151.<br><br>
One service provider agent then arises , registers itself to the facilitator agent 110 and asks for a partner to which it can insert its information.<br><br>
was.]<br>
Since the service provider agent knows that the answer from the facilitator agent 110 is the facilitator agent 110, it inserts its information to the facilitator advertise table 151 of the facilitator agent 110.<br>
Because one service provider arose and the database in the facilitator agent 110 was updated, the facilitator agent 110, in detecting this, scans its own table for an agent who has subscribed this information. In this example, the broker agent 121 is found and it sends a tell message as a notification to the broker agent 151.<br>
10090J-<br>
Because the above described service provider agent is adopted in the registering procedure in the preferred embodiment of this invention, introduction of the broker agent and service provider agent can be dynamically dealt with. However, it is to be noted that such a system which can dynamically deal with introduction of the service provider agent and the broker agent is only one aspect of the preferred embodiment of this invention and the broker agent can simply access to the facilitator agent 110 upon introduction or start to extract necessary information or select information after all agent infor¬mation have been received to establish a status in which necessary information is available to the broker agent.<br>
[0091]<br>
An operational conditions of the broker agent which received a process request from a regular agent in the<br><br>
JA2=23-W?-<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention is next described with reference to the object interaction diagram in Fig.7 and Fig.8.<br>
First, a regular agent 101 asks the facilitator agent 110 for the location of the travel broker agent 121 and receives the reply based onthe information of the facili¬tator advertise table 151.<br>
Next, the regular agent 101, knowing the location of the travel broker agent 121, sends to the broker agent 121 a request "have all agents whose ontology is Travel and who can answer when asked about a flight information of an airplane take(broker) this job". :language to broker-all at this time is kqml and :ontology is travel-ontology. Thus a travel interpreter which is one of interpreters which are held by the travel broker agent 121 will be designated and take over processing.<br>
[0084]<br>
The travel interpreter of the travel broker agent 121 internally converts the message broker-all to recruit-all (meaning hiring an agent) and throws a request to each service provider agent who represents in advance the capability by advertise performative.<br>
[0095]<br>
Each service provider agent returns information in return to this. In forward performative, the originator of the message is described in :from keyword in the<br><br>
-M9-97-1Q-7<br>
message packet. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, a reply is neglected if no reply is returned within some given time period.<br>
[0096]<br>
The travel broker agent 121 converts information from each service provider to a list structure and returns it to the regular agent which is a client.<br>
-W)97]<br>
Fig. 8 is an object interaction diagram showing an operational condition of a broker agent which received a process request from a regular agent in the preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
t0098] •<br>
In Fig.8, the regular agent 101 first requests the travel broker agent " to hire(recruit-one) an agent whose ontology is Travel and who is capable of answering when asked about a flight information of air planes, and of being subscribed, and lets it do this job.<br>
The travel broker agent 121, upon receiving this re¬quest, queries the facilitator agent 110 of whether or not "an agent whose ontology is Travel and who is capable of answering when asked about a flight information of air planes, and of being subscribed" exists in the community.<br>
■ [0100].<br>
The travel broker agent 121, when finding the party it<br><br>
TAQ-07-inT.<br>
sought for, throws a subscribe request packed in forward to the service broker agent. At this time the message packet is converted and an ontology of the content is made to Travel. The innermost content is processed by an interpreter owned by an airline agent who is a service provider.<br>
The airline agent, upon receiving this, sends the flight information directly to the regular agent 101. In addi¬tion, it notifies the regular agent 101 of any update of the flight information.<br>
mi noi^<br>
In the embodiment so far described, while the broker agent 121 requested a service provider agent of the same class to process and received and converted the process result(in the second embodiment, the service provider agent returned a reply directly to the regular agent), a manner in which a service provider agent which conducts a different kind of processing is requested to process will be next described, taking a reservation of a confer¬ence room for example.<br>
[0103]<br>
In this example, a message packet contains information such as reservation ontology and roomReservation ontolo¬gy, etc.<br>
■frfllQA]<br>
The reservation ontology has keywords including a start time,  ending  time,  and  attendees  list  while  the<br><br>
roomReservation ontology is defined as a lower level of ontology of reservation ontology and has keywords includ¬ing a list of attendees to the conference, the floor where the room is and the room number, etc.<br>
"DUOS}<br>
In the preferred embodiment of this invention, a broker which controls the roomReservation ontology has a logic which interprets in the following way.<br>
[0106]<br>
Logic 1: prepare a message packet like an ask-if message containing a schedule of the attendees between the start time and the ending time and give it to a calendar agent which controls the schedule of each attendee in the attendees list to see the schedule.<br>
[-0107] ■<br>
Logic 2: prepare an achieve message if the schedule is open and send and lock it (with or without time limit).<br>
Logic 3: prepare a sorry message if the reply from other calendar agents tells "the time frame is not open" and return it to the client.<br>
tuiuyj<br>
Logic 4: the broker agent prepares an achieve message again if the client follows with a conversation message which tells to change the time and give it to the calen¬dar agents to unlock each calendar agent.<br><br>
IAO 07 107- .<br>
Logic 5: prepare a message packet like an ask-if message for the availability of conference rooms if the time of all calendar agent is open and give it to a conference room reservation agent to ask. The conference room reservation agent is treated in the same way as other calendar agents and is only asked about available time. This is repeated while the time of all agent is open or is suitably left to an operator's interaction of a client. Alternatively, it is possible to display a table of sum of available time for each agent.<br>
I414U.<br>
Logic 6: prepare an achieve message packet and send a reservation if the time is open.<br>
Logic 7: prepare a sorry message if the time is not open and return it to the client. In this case, an operator's judgment intervenes. Like the logic 4, the operator of the client will take some other action like changing the request.<br>
An implementation of a broker agent in the preferred embodiment of this invention is now described with reference to Fig.9. In implementing the broker agent, an agent is provided in which : language is kqml and : ontolo¬gy is kqml-ontology as a default behavior to broker-one, broker-all, recommend-one, recommend-all, recruit-one, recruit-all, etc.<br><br>
A±a-<br>
The class which has this default behavior is named kqmllnterpreter class and has, as a method, broker-one, broker-all, recommend-one, recommend-al1, recruit-one, recruit-all and ones corresponding to other performative. The broker agent is formed by subclassing this class and overriding the method to realize processing which is unique to the problem area.<br>
A lower subclass in Fig.9 first receives a request from the client and conducts a process which is unique to travel-ontology for example. Note that the content is described with kqml in this case, kqmllnterpreter class supports;<br>
[0116]<br>
register, unregister, ask-one, ask-all, tell, insert, delete-one, advertise, unadvertise, recommend-all, recommend-one, sorry, error, subscribe, discard, forward, broker-one, broker-all, recruit-one, recruit-all. They belong to either one of LifeCycle ontology, YellowPage ontology and kqml ontology. In subclassing, an appropri¬ate class will be subclassed.<br>
