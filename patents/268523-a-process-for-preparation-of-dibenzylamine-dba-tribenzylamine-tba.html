				<td>Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Di/Tribenzylamine. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the amination of benzylalcohol in presence of base, hydrotalcite-like compound, as catalysts with an additive. The role of additive is to prevent the formation of benzyl ether, a by-product and facilitates to the formation of Dibenzylamine (DBA) selectively. The Dibenzylamine (DBA) is further subjected to benzylation with benzyl alcohol in the presence of a base and hydrotalcite catalyst for the preparation of Tribenzylamine (TBA).<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Dibenzylamine and tribenzylamine are important industrial organic compounds. Dibenzylamine is a secondary amine, which finds the use in the production of synthetic pencillins and in the vulcanization of rubber. Dibenzylamine acts as a novel blocker of the voltage -dependent K+ current in myocardial mouse cells. It also exhibits anti-convulasant actions in-vivo. DBA derivatives are used for elevating HDL cholesterol level.<br>
DBA is used as a starting compound for manufacturing vulcanization accelerator, tetrabenzylthiuram disulfide, which remains in the rubber as non-carcinogenic nitrosamines on decomposition. DBA occupies a special position in the manufacture of tire treads with increased tread life; tire treads provides substantial wear reduction. In addition to the wear resistance (particularly weathering and aging), the presence of DBA derivatives enhances the vulcanization properties such as, resistance, elongation at failure, tear propagation resistance, and particularly the property of elasticity when heat built-up. Therefore the use of this inventive intermediate cross-linking reagent is therefore particularly effective.<br>
Dialkyl and dibenzyl amines are used in the modification of polyvinyl chloride resin composition. Thus after improving the PVC resin composition, it shows excellent corrosion resistance, weather ability and exhibits excellent characteristic as a resin coating.<br><br>
Numerous procedures for the production of the benzylamine and dibenzylamine are described in the literature and include: the reductive amination of benzaldehyde by hydrogen and ammonia in the presence of a catalyst; the catalytic reduction of benzonitrile, benzylhydroxylamine; the condensation of benzaldehyde and benzylamine followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the intermediate Schiffs base. Generally, benzylamine and dibenzylamine are obtained in poor yields and each amine must be carefully separated from mixtures containing primary, secondary or tertiary amines, imines, aldehydes, alcohols or amides to obtain a high purity product. For example, it is known that nitriles can be catalytically reduced to the primary amine through the intermediate imine by a wide variety of catalysts. The intermediate imine further reacts with the primary amine to produce a Schiffs base with the liberation of ammonia, In the presence of a catalyst and hydrogen, the Schiffs base is further reduced to the secondary amine, in a batch process, the above reactions compete for reactants and a variety of reaction products are formed. Many optimizations have been exercised to minimize the extent of these reactions including reduction in different solvent systems and catalyst selection.<br>
Reference may be made to patents, such as US 5430187 (1995); WO-A-931304, US 5616804 (1997) wherein dibenzylamine is prepared by reacting benzaldehyde and ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst in an inert organic solvent. Although high conversion and selectivity is attained in the transformation of benzaldehyde to dibenzylamine, the drawback in the above-described processes is the formation of number of by-products, monobenzylamine, tribenzylamine and benzyl alcohol, which require efficient separation to obtain dibenzylamine.<br>
Reference may be made to a patent, such as U.S. Pat. No. 4163025 (1979) wherein high conversion is attained in the transformation of benzonitrile to benzylamine and dibenzylamine by passing benzonitrile and hydrogen counter-current through catalyst bed under suitable temperature and pressure conditions. The drawback in the above-described process is the formation of number of by-products which require efficient separation to obtain selectively primary amine and secondary amine.<br><br>
Reference may be made to patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 3,117,162(1964) and Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci. 214:100-109 (1973); U.S. Pat. No 3923891(1975) to a batch process for the reduction of benzonitrile in dilute hydrocarbon and alcohol solvent by hydrogenation over rhodium, palladium, platinum, or ruthenium catalysts (all are 5 wt.% on carbon). The drawback in the above-described process is poor selectivity in formation of benzylamine and dibenzylamine (63% and 34% respectively). The formation of dibenzylamine is favored in this process by the selective use of rhodium on carbon or platinum on carbon catalysts, but in all other cases it is obtained as a mixture containing large amounts of the primary amine. In addition, long reaction times, 2 to 21 hours, are required to reduce the benzonitrile. As a result, these prior art techniques are time consuming, requires efficient separation and costly.<br>
Catalytic processes for the amination of aliphatic alcohols to form amines are known. One of the most widely practiced routes is the reaction of ammonia with alcohols at relatively high operating temperatures (about 250 to 500.degree. C.) and low to moderate pressures (atmospheric to about 200 atm) in the presence of dehydration catalysts such as aluminum oxide, silica, aluminum phosphate, or chromium oxide. Alkylation of ammonia with alcohols has also been carried out in the presence of hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst such as copper, nickel, cobalt and platinum. Below are described representative publications illustrating catalysts used in the amination of alcohols to produce amines.<br>
Dibenzylamine is specifically manufactured by hydrogenation of benzonitrile with Pt catalysts (U.S. Pat. No.3,923,891, 1975). Other reports suggest synthesis of dibenzylamine starting with benzylamine (Synthesis (1), 70 (1979); J. Organomet. Chem. 208 (2), 249 (1981); Chem. Lett. (6), 889 (1984); Ind. J. Technol. 23 (7), 266 (1985). In addition to the above processes, dibenzylamine forms as a by-product in the industrial synthesis of benzylamine from benzaldehyde by the reaction with ammonia and catalytic hydrogenation with Raney nickel (Ullmanns Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie, 4 th edition.Vol. 8, 440).<br>
Dibenzylamine is therefore formed via the monobenzylamine and N-benzylidenimine and can be separated from the intermediate reaction mixture by<br><br>
fractionation. The reaction mixture can also contain tribenzylamine as a secondary product, and benzyl alcohol and toluene as reduction products of benzaldehyde.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention describes a batch process, which comprises a novel approach to the desired synthesis of dibenzylamine from benzylamine and benzyl alcohol in presence of base, hydrotalcite-like compounds as catalysts and an additive. In this invention aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, R'-OH react with aliphatic amines, R"-NH2 in presence of catalytic amount of hydrotalcite like compound as a catalyst to afford secondary amine in excellent yields and selectivities, where R' is selected from aryl alkyl and open chain alkyl groups consisting of benzyl, 4-methoxy benzyl, 2,4-methoxy benzyl, 2-amino benzyl, 2-chloro benzyl, in open chain aliphatic alcohols, alkyl group is ranging from C7 to C12, etc., R" is selected from aliphatic, benzyl amines and substituted benzyl amines, 4-methyl benzyl, 2-methoxy benzyl, etc. The base is selected from mainly carbonate, hydroxide and alkoxide of alkali metals, and heterogeneous catalyst, Cu-AI-hydrotalcite where the ratio of Cu:AI varies from 3:1, 2.5:1, 2:1, etc., additives are selected from the hydroxy-substituted aromatic compounds, preferably dihydroxy compounds. The reaction is carried out in<br><br>
the presence of 6-10 weight % of catalyst at a temperature ranging from 120 to 160 degree C for 7-16 h. with continuous stirring using benzyl amine as self-solvent or toluene or xylene under air atmosphere. The process of the invention overcomes the disadvantage of the prior art enumerated above since inter alia, the work up is simple, and the catalyst is recoverable and recyclable with consistent activity for several cycles. The synthesis of secondary amines, particularly DBA at high temperature and the products can be used further for the benzylation to prepare tertiary amines, tribenzylamine without adding the additive in excellent yield and selectivities. The use of cheap inorganic base, cheap catalyst and different aliphatic/ aromatic alcohols as well as benzyl amines provides secondary amines as products in good to excellent yields in a single step.<br>
Generally the ratio of Cu to Al in the catalyst is 2.5:1 and the quantity used in the reactions is 6-10 weight % with respect to benzyl alcohol. The catalyst used in the reactions can be recovered by simple filtration and reused for number of cycles with consistent activity.<br>
The novelty of present invention lies in the use of cheap heterogeneous catalyst for the first time for the amination of benzyl alcohol. The present invention provides a process for the production of dibenzylamine, which includes reacting aromatic aliphatic amines with aromatic/ aliphatic alcohols in the presence of a base, additive and catalyst, wherein the base is alkali metal hydroxide/ carbonate/ alkoxide. The additive used in this coupling reaction is nitrogen based aromatic heterocycle. The solid base catalyst of general formula, [M(ll)1-x M(lll)x (OH)2]n- An-x/n-yH20, where M(ll) and M(lll) are divalent and trivalent cations such as Cu2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ respectively, An- is the interlayer anion such as CI", N03-, C032- etc., and x = 0.1-0.33.<br>
The goal of the present invention is to provide a simple method in which, in particular, a higher selectivity for dibenzylamine, using a cheaper heterogeneous catalyst in a single step without using a pressure reactor.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of catalyst, base and an additive at a temperature ranging from 120-160 degree C, equipped with Dean-Stark apparatus to remove the water from the reaction mixture. The process comprises the unique activation of alcohol to facilitate simultaneous C-N bond formation with amine<br><br>
in presence of base and additive in a single pot. Post benzylation of the DBA to TBA is not occurred in the same reaction. The process for the TBA comprises benzylation of DBA to TBA with fresh stoichiometric amount of benzyl alcohol in presence of catalyst and a base only.<br>
Incidentally this forms the first report of formation of DBA and TBA obtained in higher yields in single pot using a cheap heterogeneous catalyst. The consistent activity obtained for several cycle makes the process economical and possible for the commercial realization.<br>
The process of the invention comprises the activation of -CH2-OH bond to facilitate simultaneous attack by nucleophile to obtain secondary amine (DBA) in excellent yield in a single pot. The catalytic cycle of coupling reaction of benzyl amine and benzyl alcohol involves first generation of bezylamine anion in presence of base and basic catalyst at high temperature. Thus the base abstracts the proton from the benzylamine under basic catalytic condition producing bezylamine anion act as a nucleophile. Thus the nucleophilic attacked by benzylamine anion at benzylic -CH2+ of benzyl alcohol further proceeded to coupling reaction to produce dibenzylamine. Further, the invention ascertains the optimum use of the additive, which requires achieving the selective formation of benzylamine and suppressed the formation byproduct (dibenzyl ether) with maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol. Thus, the catalyst can be recovered by simple filtration and reuse for the next cycle. Thus the invented strategy offers an environmentally acceptable and extremely convenient heterogeneous catalytic process for the synthesis dibenzylamine from the coupling reaction of benzyl alcohol and benzyl amine in batch processes.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 4: Preparation of Tribenzylamine catalysed by Cu/AI-hydrotalcite (2.5:1) 5.0 g (0.046 moles) benzyl alcohol, 3.0 g (0.22 moles) potassium carbonate, and 10.7g (0.53 moles) of dibenzylamine and 0.5g (10wt% w. r. t benzylalcohol) Cu-HT catalyst were initially introduced, while stirring, into a two-necked round-bottomed<br><br>
flask with a teflon magnetic bead. Red-brown suspension formed was heated up to the reflux temperature (with vigorous stirring). The temperature of the reaction mixture was gradually raised to 120-160°C over a period of 1h. The temperature of the reaction mixture was therefore maintained at 160°C for nearly 5-7 hours after which the reaction was completed as observed through GC in which no benzyl alcohol was noticed in the reaction mixture after 5-7 hours. No residual benzylalcohol was observed, a TBA content of 99 % (w. r. t. benzyl alcohol), a DBA (unreacted) value of 0.048% resulted here. The total conversion based on benzylalcohol is 100% and selectivity of TBA is 99%, 13.06g, (0.0045 moles) (w. r. t. benzyl alcohol). No additive was required for the formation of TBA. In presence of additive, only 10-20 % formation of TBA was observed after 10-16 hours.<br>
