The present invention is concerned with novel 5'-deoxy-cytidine derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions, a kit thereof for assisting a delivery of 5-fluorouracil selectively to tumor tissues and process for manufacturing the novel 5'-deoxy-cytidine derivatives.<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a group easily hydrolyzabie under<br>
physiological conditions; R2 is a hydrogen atom, or -CO-OR^ group<br>
[wherein R4 is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched<br>
hydrocarbon group consisting of one to fifteen carbon atoms, or a group of the formula -(CH2)n-Y (in which Y is cyclohexyl or phenyl; n is an<br>
integer from 0 to 4)]; R3 is a hydrogen atom, bromo, iodo, cyano, a C1-4<br>
alkyl group [which may be substituted with halogen atom(s)], a vinyl or ethynyl group [which may be substituted with halogen atom(s), C1-4 alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aralkyl, or aromatic ring which may have one or more hetero atom(s)], or an aralkyi group which may be substituted; with the proviso that R2 and R3 do not mean a hydrogen atom at the same time.<br>
Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or its derivatives are clinically useful antitumor agents for the treatment of various solid tumors, in general they are still    not satisfactory in terms of efficacy and safety. These drawbacks are mainly due to rapid inactivation of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and/or the unsatisfactory delivery of 5-FU to tumor tissues with respect to tumor selectivity. The attempts to enhance the antitumor activity of 5-FU or its<br><br>
derivatives by inhibition of DPD have already been reported : the coÂ¬administration of 5-FU or its derivative with a DPD inhibitor such as uracil [USP 4,328,229], 5-ethynyluracil [WO92/04901], 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [USP 5,525,603] etc. Such co-administration resulted in enhancement of the antitumor activity of 5-FU or its derivatives, but the safety profile was not so improved due to insufficient selectivity in delivering the DPD inhibitor to tumor tissues (as a consequence, 5-FU level is increased both in tumor and plasma).<br>
in contrast, in accordance with the present invention it has been found that the co-administration of a novel 5-deoxy-cytidine derivative represented by the general formula (!) with 5-FU or its derivative results in the significantly improved delivery of 5-FU selectively to tumor tissues as compared with the combination of 5-FU or its derivative with a known DPD inhibitor such as 5-ethynyluracil, and shows significantly improved antitumor activity in human cancer xenograft models.<br>

A compound of the formula (I) can be administered either alone or simultaneously with 5-FU or a derivative thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be obtained by formulating a compound of the formula (I) and 5-FU or a derivative thereof into a single preparation or may be provided in the form of two separate individual preparations.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the formula (I) can be administered before or simultaneously with the administration of 5-FU or a derivative thereof; preferably, within 3 hour before or simultaneously with the administration of 5-FU or a derivative thereof.<br>
In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising 5-FU or a derivative thereof and a 5'-deoxy-cytidine derivative represented by the general formula (I), the suitable molar ratio of two components is about 0.001-10 moles, preferably 0.002-0.5 mole of a compound of the formula (I) per mole of 5-FU or its derivative.<br>
The present invention also provides a kit comprising a pharmaceutical composition (component A) containing a compound of the formula (I) and a pharmaceutical composition (component B) containing 5-FU or a derivative thereof.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions and the components A and B of the kit of the present invention can be administered in any form, for example, tablets, pills, suppositories, capsules, granules, powders, or emulsions etc.   Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients useful in formulating the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are those commonly used. Pharmaceutically acceptable materials can be an organic or inorganic inert carrier material suitable for enteral, percutaneous or parenteral administration such as water, gelatine, gum arable, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols and petroleum jelly. The pharmaceutical composition provided by the present invention can be administered orally, e.g., in form of tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, solutions, syrups, suspensions or elixirs. The administration can also be cam"ed out parenterally, e.g. in form of sterile solutions, suspensions or emulsions; or locally, e.g., in form of solutions, suspensions, salves, powders or aerosols. The pharmaceutical composition can be sterilized and/or can contain further adjuvants such as preserving, stabilizing setting, emulsifying agents, flavor-improving agents , salts for variation of the osmotic pressure or substances acting as buffers.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared in a conventional manner.<br>
Dosage ranges for the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention depend on the route of administration, the age, weight and condition of the patient and the particular disease to be treated. In the case of oral, rectal or parenteral administration for adults, an approximate daily dosage is in the range of from about 1 mg to about 2,000 mg of a compound of formula (I) and from about 10 mg to about 4,000 mg of 5-FU or its derivative, depending on the kind of 5-FU derivative used. Oral administration is a preferred route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention.<br>
The tumor selective delivery of 5-FU through the tumor DPD selective inhibition by a compound of fomiula (I) is evident from the test described hereafter.<br>
1. Tumor DPD Selective Inhibition bv Compound A of Example 6<br>
The activity of compound A of Example 6 to inhibit DPD activity was<br><br>
compared with that of the known DPD inhibitor 5-ethynyluracil (5-EU) in BALB/c nude mice bearing the human prostate cancer xenograft PC-3. The liver and tumor tissues were resected out from each group of three mice at 2 and 8 hours after the administration of the Compound A (0.5 mmol/kg) and 5-EU (0.05 mol/kg). DPD activity in these tissues was then measured as described elsewhere (Naguib et al., Cancer Research 45, 5405-5412, 1985). 5-EU inhibited the DPD activity both in the liver and tumor tissue, whereas compound A strongly inhibited the activity only in tumor tissue (Table 1). These results suggest that compound A of Example 6 inhibits DPD activity selectively in tumor tissue.<br><br>
2.     Selective increase of 5-FU levels in tumors by compound A of Example 6 in mice treated with fluoropvrimidines<br>
The experiment shown in Table 2 demonstrates that compound A of Example 6 increases 5-FU AUC (Area under curve) selectively in tumors In mice treated with fluoropyrimidines. In this study, fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-FU, doxifluridine [5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine] and capecitabine [5'-deoxy-5-fluoro-N4-(n-pentyloxycarbonyl)cytidine], were given to BALB/c nude mice bearing the human gastric cancer xenograft MKN28 in combination with either compound A or 5-EU. Then, 5-FU levels in the plasma and tumor tissues were measured at 0.25, 0.5, 2, 4 and 7 hours after each fluoropyrimidine administration (n = 3 mice), and 5-FU AUC was calculated. The known DPD inhibitor 5-EU greatly increased the 5-FU AUCs both in the plasma and tumor tissues in mice treated with either 5-FU, capecitabine or doxifluridine . Since the increase of 5-FU levels in the plasma results in the systemic toxicity of 5-FU, 5-EU should enhance both the efficacy and toxicity of the fluoropyrimidines.<br>
In contrast, compound A greatly increases the 5-FU AUCs only in tumor tissues probably as a result of compound A's tumor selective inhibition of DPD activity that catabolizes 5-FU. Compound A of Example 6 therefore enhances the efficacy of fluoropyrimidines with little increasing their toxicity.<br><br><br>
3,     Enhancement of antitumor activity of Capecitabine by Compound A of Example 6<br>
Compound A of Example 6 was examined for its actiyity to enhance the efficacy of capecitabine in BALB/c nude mice bearing the human prostate cancer xenograft PC-3. Compound A and capecitabine were orally giyen simultaneously or sequentially 5 successive days per week for 3 weeks starting on day 53 after the tumor inoculation when the tumor becomes palpable. On day 75, tumor volume gain and the percentage of the tumor growth inhibition were calculated. As Table 3 shows, capecitabine inhibited tumor growth to a greater extent when compound A was given in combination either simultaneously or sequentially. Since compound A itself is not cytotoxic (data not shown), it enhances the efficacy of capecitabine by inhibiting DPD activity.<br><br><br>

b) To a solution of 2',3'-bis-0'-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-5'-deoxy-5-ethynyl-N4-(n-pentyloxycarbonyl)cytidine (19mg, 0.03 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (500|Lii) was added dropwise tetrabutylammonium fluoride (93^,1, 0.09 mmol) [1 .OM tetrahydrofuran solution] at room temperature under Ar atmosphere. After the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h., the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between dichloromethane and water. The aqueous layer was back-extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2S04, filtered<br>
and evaporated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue by silica gel<br>
chromatography (using dichloromethane : methanol = 20 :1 as an eluent) gave 5'-<br>
deoxy-5-ethynyl-N4-(n-pentyloxycarbonyl)cytidine (compound A) (9 mg, 81%<br>
yield).<br>
