BACKGROUND<br>
[00] 1         The invention relates to a water storage device having a powered anode and a<br>
method of controlling the water storage device.<br>
[00] 2        Powered anodes have been used in the water heater industry. To operate properly,<br>
a powered anode typically has to resolve two major concerns. First, the powered<br>
anode should provide enough protective current to protect exposed steel within the<br>
tank. The level of exposed steel will vary from tank to tank and will change<br>
during the lifetime of the tank. Second, the protective current resulting from the<br>
powered anode should be low enough to reduce the likelihood of excessive<br>
hydrogen.<br>
[00]3        There are at least two techniques currently available in the water heater industry<br>
for using a powered anode to protect a tank. One technique adjusts anode voltage<br>
levels based on the conductivity of the water. However, this technique does not<br>
measure the protection level of the tank and tanks with excessive exposed steel<br>
could be inadequately protected. The second technique periodically shuts off the<br>
current to the anode electrode and uses the electrode to "sense" the protection<br>
level of the tank. This technique adapts to the changing amount of exposed steel<br>
in the tank, but does not adapt to changing water conductivity levels. In addition,<br>
this technique can have problems in high conductivity waters since currently<br>
produced titanium electrodes with mixed metal oxide films have a tendency to<br>
drift in their reference voltage measurements in high conductivity water. It would<br>
be beneficial to have another alternative to the just-described techniques.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[00] 1         In one embodiment, the invention provides a water heater including a tank to hold<br>
water, an inlet to introduce cold water into the tank,       an outlet to remove hot<br>
water from the tank, a heating element (e.g., an electric resistance heating element<br>
or a gas burner), an electrode, and a control circuit. The control circuit includes a<br>
variable voltage supply, a voltage sensor, and a current sensor. The control circuit<br>
is configured to controllably apply a voltage to the electrode, determine a potential<br>
of the electrode relative to the tank when the voltage does not power the electrode,<br>
determine a current applied to the tank after the voltage powers the electrode,<br>
 <br>
2A<br>
determine a conductivity state of the water in the tank based on the applied voltage<br>
and the current, and define the voltage applied to the electrode based on the<br>
conductivity state.<br>
[00] 2         In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of controlling operation<br>
of a water storage device. The method includes the acts of applying a voltage to<br>
an electrode, ceasing the application of the applied voltage to the electrode,<br>
determining the potential of the electrode relative to the tank after the ceasing of<br>
the application of the applied voltage, determining a conductivity state of the<br>
water, defining a target potential for the electrode based on the conductivity state,<br>
and adjusting the applied voltage to have the electrode potential emulate the target<br>
potential.<br>
[00]3        In another embodiment, the invention provides another method of controlling<br>
operation of a water heater. The method includes the acts of applying a voltage to<br>
an electrode, acquiring a signal having a relation to the applied voltage,<br>
determining whether the water heater is in a dry-fire state based at least in part on<br>
the acquired signal, and preventing activation of a heating element when the water<br>
heater is in a dry-fire state.<br>
[00]4         Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the<br>
detailed description and accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00] 1         Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of<br>
construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following<br>
 <br>
3<br>
description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of<br>
other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.<br>
Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for<br>
the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limited. The use of<br>
"including," "comprising" or "having" and variations thereof herein is meant to<br>
encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional<br>
items. The terms "mounted," "connected," "supported," and "coupled" are used<br>
broadly and encompass both direct and indirect mounting, connecting, supporting,<br>
and coupling. Further, "connected" and "coupled" are not restricted to physical or<br>
mechanical connections or couplings, and can include electrical connections or<br>

[00]2        Fig. 1 illustrates a water heater 100 including an enclosed water tank 105, a shell<br>
110 surrounding the water tank 105, and foam insulation 115 filling the annular<br>
space between the water tank 105 and the shell 110. A typical storage tank 105 is<br>
made of ferrous metal and lined internally with a glass-like porcelain enamel to<br>
protect the metal from corrosion. Nevertheless, the protective lining may have<br>
imperfections or, of necessity, may not entirely cover the ferrous metal interior.<br>
Under these circumstances, an electrolytic corrosion cell may be established as a<br>
result of dissolved solids in the stored water, leading to corrosion of the exposed<br>
ferrous metal and to reduction of service life for the water heater 100.<br>
[00]3         A water inlet line or dip tube 120 and a water outlet line 125 enter the top of the<br>
water tank 105. The water inlet line 120 has an inlet opening 130 for adding cold<br>
water to the water tank 105, and the water outlet line 125 has an outlet opening<br>
135 for withdrawing hot water from the water tank 105. The water heater 100 also<br>
includes an electric resistance heating element 140 that is attached to the tank 105<br>
and extends into the tank 105 to heat the water. The heating element 140 typically<br>
includes an internal high resistance heating element wire surrounded by a suitable<br>
insulating material and enclosed in a metal jacket. Electric power for the heating<br>
element 140 is typically supplied from a control circuit. While a water heater 100<br>
having element 140 is shown, the invention can be used with other water heater<br>
types, such as a gas water heater, and with other water heater element designs. It<br>
is also envisioned that the invention or aspects of the invention can be used in<br>
other water storage devices.<br>
 <br>
4<br>
[00]4         An electrode assembly 145 is attached to the water heater 100 and extends into the<br>
tank 105 to provide corrosion protection to the tank. An example electrode<br>
assembly 145 capable of being used with the water heater is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, the electrode assembly 145 includes an electrode wire<br>
150 and a connector assembly 155. The electrode wire 150 comprises titanium<br>
and has a first portion 160 that is coated with a metal-oxide material and a second<br>
portion 165 that is not coated with the metal-oxide material. During<br>
manufacturing of the electrode assembly 145, a shield tube 170, comprising PEX<br>
or polysulfone, is placed over a portion of the electrode wire 150. The electrode<br>
wire 150 is then bent twice (e.g., at two forty-five degree angles) to hold the shield<br>
tube in place. A small portion 175 of the electrode wire 150 near the top of the<br>
tank is exposed to the tank for allowing hydrogen gas to exit the shield tube. In<br>
other constructions, the electrode assembly 145 does not include the shield tube<br>
170. The connector assembly 155 includes a spud 180 having threads, which<br>
secure the electrode rod assembly to the top of the water tank 105 by mating with<br>
the threads of opening 190 (Fig. 1). Of course, other connector assemblies known<br>
to those skilled in the art can be used to secure the electrode assembly 145 to the<br>
tank 105. The connector assembly also includes a connector 195 for electrically<br>
connecting the electrode wire 150 to a control circuit (discussed below).<br>
Electrically connecting the electrode assembly 145 to the control circuit results in<br>
the electrode assembly 145 becoming a powered anode. As is known to those<br>
skilled in the art, the electrode wire 150 is electrically isolated from the tank 105<br>
to allow for a potential to develop across the electrode wire 150 and the tank 105.<br>
[00]5         An electronic schematic for one construction of the control circuit 200 used for<br>
controlling the electrode assembly 145 is shown in Fig. 3. The control circuit<br>
includes a microcontroller U2. An example microcontroller U2 used in one<br>
construction of the control circuit 200 is a Silicon Laboratories microcontroller,<br>
model no. 8051F310. As will be discussed in more detail below, the<br>
microcontroller U2 receives signals or inputs from a plurality of sensors, analyzes<br>
the inputs, and generates outputs to control the electrode assembly 145. In<br>
addition, the microcontroller U2 can receive other inputs (e.g., inputs from a user)<br>
and can generate outputs to control other devices (e.g., the heating element 140).<br>
As is known in the art, the Silicon Laboratories microcontroller, model no.<br>
8051F310, includes a processor and memory. The memory includes one or more<br>
 <br>
5<br>
modules having instructions. The processor obtains, interprets, and executes the<br>
instructions to control the water heater 100, including the electrode assembly 145.<br>
Although the microcontroller U2 is described having a processor and memory, the<br>
invention may be implemented with other devices including a variety of integrated<br>
circuits (e.g., an application-specific-integrated circuit) and discrete devices, as<br>
would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[00]6         The microcontroller U2 outputs a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signal at P0.1.<br>
Generally speaking, the PWM signal controls the voltage applied to the electrode<br>
wire 150. A one hundred percent duty cycle results in full voltage being applied to<br>
the electrode wire 150, a zero percent duty cycle results in no voltage being<br>
applied to the electrode wire 150, and a ratio between zero and one hundred<br>
percent will result in a corresponding ratio between no and full voltage being<br>
applied to the electrode wire 150.<br>
[00] 7         The PWM signal is applied to a low-pass filter and amplifier, which consists of<br>
resistors R2, R3, and R4; capacitor C3; and operational amplifier U3-C. The low-<br>
pass filter converts the PWM signal into an analog voltage proportional to the<br>
PWM signal. The analog voltage is provided to a buffer and current limiter,<br>
consisting of operational amplifier U3-D, resistors R12 and R19, and transistors<br>
Ql and Q3. The buffer and current limiter provides a buffer between the<br>
microcontroller U2 and the electrode assembly 145 and limits the current applied<br>
to the electrode wire 150 to prevent hydrogen buildup. Resistor R7, inductor LI,<br>
and capacitor C5 act as a filter to prevent transients and oscillations. The result of<br>
the filter is a voltage that is applied to the electrode assembly 145, which is<br>
electrically connected to CON1.<br>
[00] 8         As discussed later, the drive voltage is periodically removed from the electrode<br>
assembly 145. The microcontroller deactivates the drive voltage by controlling<br>
the signal applied to a driver, which consists of resistor R5 and transistor Q2.<br>
More specifically, pulling pin P0.3 of microcontroller U2 low results in the<br>
transistor Ql turning OFF, which effectively removes the applied voltage from<br>
driving the electrode assembly 145. Accordingly, the microcontroller U2, the low-<br>
pass filter and amplifier, the buffer and current limiter, the filter, and the driver act<br>
as a variable voltage supply that controllably applies a voltage to the electrode<br>
assembly 145, resulting in the powered arrode. Other circuit designs known to<br>
 <br>
6<br>
those skilled in the art can be used to controllably provide a voltage to the<br>
electrode assembly 145.<br>
[00]9         The connection C0N2 provides a connection that allows for an electrode return<br>
current measurement. More specifically, resistor R15 provides a sense resistor<br>
that develops a signal having a relation to the current at the tank. Operational<br>
amplifier U3-B and resistors R13 and R14 provide an amplifier that provides an<br>
amplified signal to the microcontroller U2 at pin Pl.l. Accordingly, resistor R15<br>
and the amplifier form a current sensor. However, other current sensors can be<br>
used in place of the sensor just described.<br>
[00] 10      With the removal of the voltage, the potential at the electrode 145 drops to a<br>
potential that is offset from, but proportional to, the open circuit or "natural<br>
potential" of the electrode 145 relative to the tank 105. A voltage proportional to<br>
the natural potential is applied to a filter consisting of resistor R6 and capacitor<br>
C4. The filtered signal is applied to operational amplifier U3-A, which acts as a<br>
voltage follower. The output of operational amplifier U3-A is applied to a voltage<br>
limiter (resistor R17 and zener diode D3) and a voltage divider (resistor R18 and<br>
R20). The output is a signal having a relation to the natural potential of the<br>
electrode assembly 145, which is applied to microcontroller U2 at pin P1.0.<br>
Accordingly, the just-described filter, voltage follower, voltage limiter, and<br>
voltage divider form a voltage sensor. However, other voltage sensors can be used<br>
in place of the disclosed voltage sensor.<br>
[00]ll       The control circuit 200 controls the voltage applied to the electrode wire 150. As<br>
will be discussed below, the control circuit 200 also measures tank protection<br>
levels, adapts to changing water conductivity conditions, and adapts to electrode<br>
potential drift in high conductivity water. In addition, when the control circuit 200<br>
for the electrode assembly 145 is combined or in communication with the control<br>
circuit for the heating element 140, the resulting control circuit can take advantage<br>
of the interaction to provide additional control of the water heater.<br>
[00] 12       Fig. 4 provides one method of controlling the electrode assembly 145. Before<br>
proceeding to Fig. 4, it should be understood that the order of steps disclosed<br>
could vary. Furthermore, additional steps can be added to the control sequence<br>
and not all of the steps may be required. During normal operation, voltage is<br>
applied from the control circuit 200 to the electrode assembly 145. Periodically<br>
 <br>
7<br>
(e.g., every 100 ms), an interrupt occurs and the control circuit enters the control<br>
loop shown in Fig. 4.<br>
[00] 13       With reference to Fig. 4, the control circuit 200 disables the voltage applied to the<br>
electrode assembly 145 (block 220). After disabling the voltage, the control<br>
circuit 200 performs a delay (block 225), such as 250 us, and determines an<br>
electrode potential (block 230). The control circuit 200 performs the delay to<br>
allow the electrode assembly 145 to relax to its open circuit. The microcontroller<br>
Ul then acquires this potential from the voltage sensor. The control circuit 200<br>
then reapplies the voltage to the electrode assembly 145 (block 240). At block<br>
240, the control circuit 200 determines whether the electrode potential is greater<br>
than a target potential. If the electrode potential is greater than the target potential,<br>
the control circuit proceeds to block 245; otherwise the control proceeds to block<br>
250.<br>
[00] 14       At block 245, the control circuit 200 determines whether the applied voltage is at a<br>
minimum value. If the applied voltage is at the minimum, the control circuit 200<br>
proceeds to block 255; otherwise the control circuit 200 proceeds to block 260. At<br>
block 260, the control circuit decreases the applied voltage.<br>
[00] 15       At block 250, the control circuit 200 determines whether the applied voltage is at a<br>
maximum value. If the applied voltage is at the maximum, the control circuit 200<br>
proceeds to block 255; otherwise the control circuit proceeds to block 265. At<br>
block 265, the control circuit 200 increases the applied voltage. By decreasing or<br>
increasing the applied voltage at block 260 or 265, respectively, the control circuit<br>
200 can indirectly adjust the electrode potential. Increasing the applied voltage<br>
will result in an increase in the tank potential measured by the electrode and<br>
decreasing the applied voltage will decrease the tank potential measured by the<br>
electrode. Therefore, the control circuit 200 can adjust the open circuit potential<br>
of the electrode until it reaches the target potential. Furthermore, as the<br>
characteristics of the water heater 100 change, the control circuit 200 can adjust<br>
the voltage applied to the electrode to have the open circuit potential of the<br>
electrode equal the target point potential.<br>
[00]16 At block 255, the control circuit acquires an electrode current. More specifically,<br>
the microcontroller Ul receives a signal that represents a sensed current form the<br>
current sensor. At block 270, the control circuit determines a conductivity state of<br>
 <br>
8<br>
the water. For example, the conductivity state can be either a high conductivity<br>
for the water or a low conductivity for the water. To determine the conductivity<br>
state (either high or low), the microcontroller Ul divides the applied current by an<br>
incremental voltage, which is equal to the applied voltage minus the open circuit<br>
potential. If the resultant is less than an empirically set value, then the control<br>
circuit 200 determines the conductivity state is low and sets the target potential to<br>
a first value; otherwise the control circuit sets the target potential to a second value<br>
indicating a high conductivity state (block 275). The control circuit 200 can<br>
repeatedly perform the conductivity test during each interrupt (as shown in Fig. 4),<br>
periodically perform the conductivity test at a greater interval than the setting of<br>
the electrode voltage, or perform the conductivity test only during a startup<br>
sequence. Additionally, while only two set points are shown, it is envisioned that<br>
multiple set points can be used. It is also envisioned that other methods can be<br>
used to determine the conductivity state of the water. For example, a ratio of the<br>
applied current divided by the applied voltage can be used to determine the<br>
conductivity state.<br>
[00] 17       In addition to establishing a set point, the control circuit 200 can use the acquired<br>
current to determine whether the water heater 100 is in a dry-fire state. The term<br>
"dry fire" refers to the activation of a water heater that is not storing a proper<br>
amount of water. Activation of a heating element (e.g., an electric resistance<br>
heating element or a gas burner) of a water heater in a dry-fire state may result in<br>
damage to the water heater. For example, if water is not properly surrounding the<br>
electric resistance heating element 140, then the electric resistance heating element<br>
may burnout in less than a minute when voltage is applied to the heating element<br>
140. Therefore, it is beneficial to reduce the likelihood of activating the heating<br>
element 140 if the water heater 100 is in a dry-fire state. If the acquired current is<br>
less than a minimum value (e.g., essentially zero), then it is assumed that the water<br>
heater 100 is not storing the proper amount of water and the control circuit 200<br>
prevents the activation of the heating element 140. It is also envisioned that other<br>
methods for determining a dry-fire state can be used. For example, the control<br>
circuit 200 can be designed in such a fashion that the electrode potential will be<br>
approximately equal to the applied voltage under dry fire conditions.<br>
