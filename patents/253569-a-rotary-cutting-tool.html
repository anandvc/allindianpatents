				<td>CUTTING TOOL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]      This invention generally relates to a cutting tool and is specifically concerned with a separable end working or rotary cutting tool that is adapted to rotate to cut a stationary workpiece or that may cut a rotating work piece when stationary.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]      Separable rotary cutting tools are known in the prior art. One such tool is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,904,455, to Krenzer et al. This tool is described as a drill comprising an insert and body. The drill has a locating feature comprised of a groove in the body defined by two groove flanks and mating side faces on the head. The groove is slightly smaller than the insert. This results in a positive location and an interference fit between the insert and body. In operation, the insert is forced in an axial direction in the groove or drawn into the groove with a screw. In absence of a screw, the insert is predisposed to be axially displaced and thus can become axially dislodged from the groove. On the other hand, the use of a screw would require the physical size of the tool to be large enough to accompany the screw. [0003]      Other separable rotary cutting tools are described in U.S. Patents No. 6,059,492 and 5,957,631, to Hecht Both patents describe an insert and body joint One embodiment includes two base surfaces, two torque transmission walls, and two fixation walls. The transmission and fixation walls are located between the base surfaces and adjacent to one another. The transmission walls are spaced 180 degrees apart as are the fixation walls. The fixation walls are conical or dovetail in shape and expand in a direction away from the cutting tip of the insert The base surfaces are transverse or perpendicular from the axis of the body. A front base surface is used as the axial stop. The torque transmission walls are defined as extending in radial directions. The fixation walls are defined as having radial dimensions substantially less than the cutting diameter. Hecht also describes an embodiment comprised of a pair of base surfaces, one of which acts as an axial stop. Torque transmission walls and fixation walls are located between these base surfaces. The torque transmission walls are transverse to the axis of the fixation walls. The length of the fixation and transmission walls is about the same. The fixation walls are located further away<br><br>
from the tool tip than the torque transmission walls. Both of these embodiments described by Hecht have a reduced risk of becoming axially dislodged because each includes conical or dovetail shaped fixation walls. However, such walls are difficult to machine because the walls expand in a direction away from the cutting tip of the insert and into the body.<br>
[0004]      Clearly, there is a need for a separable rotary cutting tool that is not prone to inadvertent axial separation. Ideally, such a tool would be easier to manufacture and thus minimize the cost of the tool. Finally, it would be desirable if such a tool could be easily assembled.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]      Generally speaking, the invention is directed to a rotary cutting tool that overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings associated with the prior art. To this end, the tool of the invention comprises a shank and a head. The shank has a receiver comprised of a shank guide at a trailing end of the receiver, opposing shank drive keys at a leading end of the receiver, and a shank locator located axially between the shank guide and the shank drive keys. The shank drive keys each comprises an axially extending shank drive key radial stop surface that is disposed at an angle relative to a plane extending through a central axis of the receiver. The head has a connector comprised of a head guide at a trailing end of the connector, opposing head drive keys at a leading end of the connector, and a head locator located axially between the head guide and the head drive keys. The head drive keys each comprises an axially extending head drive key radial stop surface that is disposed at an angle relative to a plane extending through a central axis of the connector. Each shank drive key radial stop surface is adapted to angularly align with a corresponding head drive key radial stop surface.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0024]       With reference now to Figures 1 -6, wherein like numerals designate like components throughout all of the several Figures, there is illustrated a rotary drill or tool 10 having a leading end, generally indicated at 12, and the trailing end, generally indicated at 14. The tool 10 is comprised of a body or shank 16 and an insert or head  18. The shank 16 has a receiver or receiving portion 20 at its leading end and a shank 22 at its trailing end. The head 18 has a cutting tip 24 at its leading end and a connector or mounting portion 26 at its trailing end. The mounting portion 26 cooperates with the receiving portion 20 to couple the head 18 to the shank 16. [0025]       The receiving portion 20 is comprised of a guide or shank guide portion 28, a locator or shank locating portion 30 at the leading end of the shank guide portion 28, and diametrically disposed torque or drive keys 32 (also referred to as shank drive keys) at the leading end of the shank locating portion 30. The mounting portion 26 is comprised of diametrically disposed torque or drive keys 34 (also referred to as head drive keys), a locator or head locating portion 36 at the trailing end of the head drive keys 34, and a guide or head guide portion 38 at the trailing end of the head locating portion 36.<br>
[0026]       The mounting portion 26 is adapted to be axially inserted into the receiving portion 20 until the head guide portion 38 engages the shank guide portion 28. Upon twisting the head 18, the locating portions 30 and 36 engage one another to provide an interference fit The drive keys 32 and 34 radially engage one another to function as cooperating radial stop surfaces and drive surfaces during the operation of the tool 10.<br>
[0027]       The shank guide portion 28 is preferably defined in part by an inner cylindrical surface, such as the inner guide surface 40 shown. The inner guide surface 40 is preferably a generally straight cylindrical surface having a shank guide diameter D1 (shown in Figure 4). The shank guide portion 28 may also be provided with a generally spherical radial inner radial surface 42 adjacent its trailing end, as shown in Figures 1-6, or a conical inner radial surface 44, as shown in Figure 6. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the diameter of a conical inner radial surface 44 increases toward the leading end of the shank guide portion 28. The trailing end of the shank guide portion 28 may be defined by a first radially extending surface, which<br><br>
may also be referred to a radially extending shank guide surface. The first radially extending surface may be an arcuate or spherical surface 46, which may coexist with the spherical inner radial surface 42, or a generally flat surface 48, as shown in Figures 7, 9,11,13, and 15, which extends generally perpendicular to the axis A1 of the shank 16. The spherical and conical inner radial surfaces 42 and 44 may function as axial stop surfaces, as shown in Figures 5 and 7. This holds true even if the radially extending surface is perpendicular to the shank axis A1, as shown in Figures 9,11,13, and 15.<br>
[0028]      The shank locating portion 30 is preferably defined by a cylindrical bore. The cylindrical bore may be a generally straight cylindrical bore defined by generally straight cylindrical inner locating surfaces 50, as shown in Figures 7, 9,11,13, and 15, or a tapered bore defined by tapered inner locating surfaces 52, as shown in Figure 5. The distance between the generally straight cylindrical inner locating surfaces 50, or the smallest distance between the tapered inner locating surfaces 52, is measured by a shank locator or locating diameter D2 (shown in Figure 4). [0029]      The surfaces defining the shank guide and locating portions 28 and 30 may be joined by a transitional surface 54. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the transitional surface 54 is inclined obliquely relative to the central axis A1 of the shank 16 and faces generally longitudinally toward the leading end of the receiving portion 20. The transitional surface 54 accommodates for the difference between the shank guide and locating diameters D1 and D2 (shown in Figure 4). [0030]      The locating portion 30 terminates at a second radially extending surface located at the leading end of the locating portion 30. The second radially extending surface may be defined by a pair of radially extending surfaces 56, which extend perpendicularly to the central axis A1 of the shank 16, as shown in Figures 5, 7, 9, 13, and 15, or radially extending surfaces 58, which are inclined obliquely relative to the central axis A1 and face generally longitudinally toward the leading end of the shank 16, as shown in Figure 11. The second radially extending surface may function as an axial stop surface in the place of the first radially extending surface described above. [0031]      The shank drive keys 32 are located at the leading end of the shank locating portion 30. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the shank drive keys 32 have an axial profile dimension D3 (shown in Figure 5) and a radial profile<br><br>
dimension D4 (shown in Figure 4). The radial profile dimension D4 is preferably smaller than the axial profile dimension D3 to enable the shank drive keys 32 to be closely aligned with the central axis A1 of the shank 16. The shank drive keys 32 are defined by an inner shank drive key surface 60, an outer shank drive key surface 62, a pair of circumferentially spaced, axially extending shank drive key surfaces 66 and 64, and a radially extending shank drive key surface, which may also be referred to as a third radially extending surface 68. The third radially extending surface 68 extends in a first direction between the inner and outer shank drive key surfaces 60 and 62 and in a second direction between the circumferentially spaced, axially extending shank drive key surfaces 66 and 64, all shown in Figure 1. The inner shank drive key surface 60 may be coexistent with the inner shank locating surface. Similarly, the outer shank drive key surface 62 may be coexistent with an outer curved surface 70 of the shank 16. One of the circumferentially spaced, axially extending shank drive key surfaces 66 may define a flute, or a flute portion, through which particles of a workpiece may be discharged when the tool 10 is in use. The other circumferentially spaced, axially extending shank drive key surface 64 functions as a shank drive key radial stop surface, which is preferably disposed at an angle a (shown in Figure 5) relative to a plane extending through the axis A1 of the shank 16 and facing generally longitudinally toward the trailing end of the shank 16. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the angle a is 15 degrees. The shank drive key radial stop surfaces 64 may be perpendicular relative to the inner and outer shank drive key surfaces 60 and 62, as shown in Figures 5,9,11,13, and 15. Alternatively, shank drive key radial stop surfaces 72 may be provided which are inclined relative to the inner and outer shank drive key surfaces 60 and 62, as shown in Figure 7. The third radially extending surface 68 may be perpendicular relative to the central axis A1 of the shank 16, as shown in Figures 5,7,11, and 13. Alternatively, a third radially extending surface 74 may be provided which is inclined relative to the central axis A1, as shown in Figures 9 and 15. Inclined axially or radially extending surfaces may reduce the risk that the shank drive keys 32 will spread apart It should be appreciated that the third radially extending surface 68 may function as an axial stop surface in the place of the first and second radially extending surfaces described above.<br><br>
[0032J      The head guide portion 38 is preferably defined in part by an outer cylindrical surface, such as the outer guide surface 78 shown. The outer guide surface 78 is preferably a straight cylindrical surface having a head guide diameter D5 (shown in Figures 4 and 6). The head guide portion 38 may also include a generally spherical outer radial surface 82, as shown in Figure 5, adjacent its trailing end, or a conical outer radial surface 84, as shown in Figure 7. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the diameter of the conical surface 84 increases toward the leading end of the head guide portion 38. The trailing end of the head guide portion 38 may be defined by a first radially extending surface, which may also be referred to as a radially extending head guide surface. The first radially extending surface may be an arcuate or spherical radial surface, which may coexist with the spherical outer radial surface 82, or a generally flat surface 76, as shown in Figures 7, 9,11,13, and 15, which extends generally perpendicularly to the axis A2 of the head 18. The head guide portion 38 is adapted to engage the shank guide portion 28 and functions to stabilize the shank 16 and head 18 in radial direction when coupling the head 18 to the shank 26.<br>
[0033J      The head locating portion 36 is defined by an outer surface. The outer surface may be a generally straight cylindrical surface outer locating surface 86, as shown in Figures 7, 9,11,13, and 15. Alternatively, the outer surface may be a tapered outer locating surface 88, as shown in Figure 5. The largest diameter of the outer surface is defined by the head locator or locating diameter D6 (shown in Figures 4 and 6) and is slightly larger than the shank locating diameter D2 (shown in Figure 4). Consequently, the head locating portion 36 must be forced into the shank locating portion 30, causing the shank locating portion 30 to deflect outward, resulting in an interference fit between the two locating portions 30 and 36. It should be appreciated that a tapered outer locating surface 88 having a larger diameter at its leading end insures contact substantially with the entire shank locating portion 30, even when the shank locating portion 30 deflects outward. The increase in diameter D6 is preferably measured by an angle of inclination β (shown in Figure 5) in the tapered outer locating surface 88 of less than one degree relative to a plane P1 extending generally parallel to the central axis A1.<br><br>
[0034]      The head locating portion 36 preferably has an axially extending angular lead surface 90 which provides clearance for an approaching portion of the head location portion 36 upon rotating the head 18 to couple the head 18 to the shank 16. The angle of the axially extending or angular lead surface 90 may vary. The angle is preferably in a range between 2 degrees and 20 degrees. For example, the angle 01 of • fee lead surface 90 shown in Figure 14 is 15 degrees relative to a line tangent to the outer locating surface at the intersection of the outer locating surface and the lead surface 90. The angle 82 of the lead surface 90 shown in Figure 6, 8,10,12, and 16 is 20 degrees.<br>
[0035]      In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the head locating portion 36 has a larger diameter D6 (shown in Figures 4 and 6) that is more than half the cutting diameter D7 of the tool 10 (shown in Figures 4 and 5). This is to establish a relationship between the locating diameter and the depth of the flute to insure proper assembly of the shank 16 and head 18. Moreover, the length of the head locating portion 36 is slightly less or more than the head locating diameter D6 (shown in Figures 4 and 6). For example, a range for the length of the head locating portion 36 may be 3/4 to 2 times the head locating diameter D6- The length of the head locating portion 36 would be determined by the size of the tool 10. Larger tools would be in the 3/4 to 1 1/4 range while smaller diameters could be up to 2 times the diameter. [0036]       Similar to the receiving portion 20 set forth above, the mounting portion 26 may be provided with a transitional surface 92. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the transitional surface 92 is inclined obliquely relative to the central axis A1 of the head 18 and faces generally longitudinally toward the trailing end of the mounting portion 26. The transitional surface 92 accommodates for the difference between the head guide and locating diameters D5 and D6 (shown in Figures 4 and 6). [0037]      The head locating portion 36 terminates at a second radially extending surface located at the leading end of the head locating portion 36. The second radially extending surface may be defined by a pair of radially extending surfaces 94, which extend perpendicularly to the central axis A? of the head 18, as shown in Figures 5, 7, 9,13, and 15, or radially extending surfaces 96, which are inclined obliquely relative to the central axis A2 and face generally longitudinally toward the trailing end of the head 18, as shown in Figure 11.<br><br>
[0038]      The head drive keys 34 are located at the leading end of the head locating portion 36. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the head drive keys 34 have an axial profile dimension Dg and a radial profile dimension D9 (shown in Figure 4). The radial profile dimension D9 is preferably less than the head locating diameter D6 (shown in Figures 4 and 6). Longer head drive keys 34 may result in a weaker connection between the shank 16 and the head 18. Moreover, the radial profile dimension D9 is preferably smaller than the axial profile dimension D8 to enable the head drive keys 34 to be closely aligned with centra] axis A2 of the head 18. The head drive keys 34 are defined by an outer head drive key surface 100, circumferentially spaced, axially extending head drive key surfaces 102 and 104, and a radially extending head drive key surface, which may be referred to as a third radially extending surface 106 (all shown in Figure 1). One of the axially extending head drive key surfaces 102 may define a portion of a flute. The other axially extending head drive key surface 104 functions as a head drive key radial stop surface, which is preferably disposed at an angle a relative to a plane P1 extending through a central axis A2 of the head 18 and facing generally longitudinally toward the leading end of the head 18, as shown in Figure 5. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the angle a is 15 degrees. The head drive key radial stop surfaces 104 may be perpendicular relative to the outer surface 100, as shown in Figures 5, 9,11,13, and 15. Alternatively, head drive key radial stop surfaces 108 may be provided which are inclined relative to the outer surface 100, as shown in Figure 7. The head drive key radial stop surfaces 102 and 108 are adapted to fit in angular alignment with the shank drive key radial stop surfaces 64 and 72. The third radial surface 106 may be perpendicular relative to the central axis A2. Alternatively, a third radially extending surface 106 may be provided which is inclined relative to the central axis A2, as shown in Figures 9,15, and 17.<br>
{0039]      In operation, the mounting portion 26 is adapted to be inserted axially into the receiving portion 20. Subsequently, the head 18 is twisted into a final radial location determined by the engagement of the shank drive keys 32 and 34. [0040]      It should be noted that the locating diameters D2 and D2 (shown in Figure 4) must be larger than the guide diameters D1 and D5 (also shown in Figure 4). Moreover, the guide diameters D1 and D5 should be sufficiently small enough to<br><br>
require the head guide portion 38 to be inserted axially into the shank guide portion 28. In this way, the guide portions 38 and 28 cooperatively act as a guide during rotation of the head 18. The drill flutes should be dimensioned so that the head guide portion 38 does not escape in the radial direction from the shank guide portion 28. By providing locating diameters D2 and D6 that are larger than guide diameters D1 and D5, the drill flutes may be dimensioned large enough to allow the mounting portion 26 to be inserted into the receiving portion 20 within the flutes. The head 18 may then be rotated 90 degrees with an assembly tool (not shown) that serves as a radial guide for the leading end of the shank 16 and the head 18.<br>
[0041]      The angular alignment of the drive key radial stop surfaces 64 and 72 provides retention of the head 18 during removal of the tool 10 from a work piece (not shown). Rotary cutting tools tend to drag during retraction. This drag creates a torsional moment on the head 18 as well as a force to separate the head 18 from the shank 16. The torsional moment, combined with the angular alignment of the drive keys 32 and 34, make it difficult for the head 18 to separate from the shank 16. [0042]       It should be appreciated that the shank 16 may include a mounting portion, such as that shown and described above, and the head 18 may include a receiving portion.<br>
