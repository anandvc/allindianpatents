Application 60/286,949 filed April 27, 2001, the contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention is in the field of<br>
medicinal chemistry and relates to compounds that are<br>
protein kinase inhibitors, compositions containing such<br>
compounds and methods of use. ore particularly, this<br>
invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of<br>
GSK-3 and Aurora-2 protein kinases. The invention also<br>
relates to methods of treating diseases associated with<br>
these protein kinases, such as diabetes, cancer and<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The search for new therapeutic agents has been<br>
greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of<br>
the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules<br>
associated with target diseases. One important class of<br>
enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is<br>
the protein kinases.<br>
 Protein kinases mediate intracellular signal<br>
transduction. They do this by effecting a phosphoryl<br>
transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein<br>
acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. There<br><br>
are a number of kinases and pathways through which<br>
extracellular and other stimuli cause a variety of<br>
cellular responses to occur inside the cell. Examples of<br>
such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress<br>
signals (e.g. osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, bacterial endotoxin, H2O2), cytokines (e.g.<br>
interleukin-1 (IL-l) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-<br>
?)) , and growth factors (e.g. granulocyte macrophage-<br>
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth<br>
factor (FGF). An extracellular stimulus may effect one<br>
or more cellular responses related to cell growth,<br>
migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones,<br>
activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction,<br>
glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis and<br>
regulation of cell cycle.<br>
 Many diseases are associated with abnormal<br>
cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated<br>
events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases,<br>
inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative<br>
diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and<br>
asthma, Alzheimer's disease or hormone-related diseases.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in<br>
medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors<br>
that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
 Aurora-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that has been implicated in human cancer, such as colon,<br>
breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is believed<br>
to be involved in protein phosphorylation events that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 may play<br>
a role in controlling the accurate segregation of<br>
chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell<br>
cycle can lead to cellular proliferation and other<br>
abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the aurora-<br><br>
 2 protein has been found to be overexpressed. See<br>
Bischoff et al., EMBO J., 1998, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher<br>
et al., J. Cell Biol., 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 13766-13771.<br>
 Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and p<br>
isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan<br>
et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and<br>
Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev., 10, 508-514 (2000)].<br>
GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including<br>
diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, CNS disorders such as<br>
manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases,<br>
and cardiomyocete hypertrophy [WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675;<br>
and Haq et al., J. Cell Biol. (2000) 151, 117]. These<br>
diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which<br>
GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been found to<br>
phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of<br>
regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen<br>
synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for<br>
glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor p-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP<br>
citrate lyase, axin, .heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc,<br>
c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These diverse protein targets<br>
implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism,<br>
proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
 In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant<br>
for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced<br>
signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. Along this pathway, GSK-3 is a negative<br>
regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the<br>
presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated<br><br>
phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase.<br>
The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen<br>
synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93,<br>
8455-9 (1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-26<br>
(1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993);<br>
Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299, 123-128 (1994)].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient where the insulin response<br>
is impaired, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail<br>
to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood<br>
levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and long term effects that<br>
may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal<br>
failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal<br>
insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It<br>
has also been reported that in patients with type II<br>
diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 are therefore potentially<br>
useful for treating diabetic patients suffering from an<br>
impaired response to insulin.<br>
 GSK-3 activity has also been associated, with<br>
Alzheimer's disease. This disease is characterized by<br>
the well-known ?-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The<br>
neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau<br>
protein where Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal<br>
sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation<br>
of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Current Biology 4,<br>
1077-86 (1994); Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8, 3251-55<br>
(1997)]. Therefore, it is believed that GSK-3 activity<br>
may promote generation of the neurofibrillary tangles and<br>
the progression of Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
 Another substrate of GSK-3 is ?-catenin which<br>
is degradated after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced<br>
levels of ?-catenin have been reported in schizophrenic<br>
patients and have also been associated with other<br>
diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death<br>
[Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et<br>
al., PNAS, 90, 7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathoi. Exp, 56, 70-78 (1997)].<br>
 As a result of the biological importance of<br>
GSK-3, there is current interest in therapeutically<br>
effective GSK-3 inhbitors. Small molecules that inhibit<br>
GSK-3 have recently been reported [WO 99/65897 (Chiron)<br>
and WO 00/38675 (SmithKline Beecham)].<br>
 For many of the aforementioned diseases<br>
associated with abnormal GSK-3 activity, other protein<br>
kinases have also been targeted for treating the same<br>
diseases. However, the various protein kinases often act<br>
through different biological pathways. For example,<br>
certain quinazoline derivatives have been reported<br>
recently as inhibitors of p38 kinase (WO 00/12497 to<br>
Scios). The compounds are reported to be useful for<br>
treating conditions characterized by enhanced p38-?<br>
activity and/or enhanced TGF-p activity. While p38<br>
activity has been implicated in a wide variety of<br>
diseases, including diabetes, p38 kinase is not reported<br>
to be a constituent of an insulin signaling pathway that<br>
regulates glycogen synthesis or glucose uptake.<br>
Therefore, unlike GSK-3, p38 inhibition would not be<br>
expected to enhance glycogen synthesis and/or glucose<br>
uptake.<br>
There is a continued need to find new<br>
therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. The protein<br>
kinases aurora-2 and GSK-3 are especially attractive<br><br>
targets for the discovery of new therapeutics due to<br>
their important role in cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's<br>
disease and other diseases.<br>

 As used herein, the following definitions shall<br>
apply unless otherwise indicated. The"phrase "optionally<br>
substituted" is used interchangeably with the phrase<br>
"substituted or unsubstituted" or with the term<br>

optionally substituted group may have a substituent at<br>
each substitutable position of the group, and each<br>
substitution is independent of the other.<br>
 The term "aliphatic" as used herein means<br>
straight-chain, branched or cyclic C1-C12 hydrocarbons<br>
which are completely saturated or which contain one or<br>
more units of unsaturation but which are not aromatic.<br>
For example, suitable aliphatic groups include<br>
substituted or unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic<br>
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such<br>
as (eyeloalkyl)alkyl, (eyeloalkenyl)alkyl or<br><br>
(cycloalkyl)alkenyl. The terms "alkyl", "alkoxy",<br>

straight and branched chains containing one to twelve<br>
carbon atoms. The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" used<br>
alone or as part of a larger moiety shall include both<br>
straight and branched chains containing two to twelve<br>
carbon atoms. The term "cycloalkyl" used alone or as<br>
part of a larger moiety shall include cyclic C3-C12<br>
hydrocarbons which are completely saturated or which<br>
contain one or more units of unsaturation, but which are<br>
not aromatic.<br>
 The terms "haloalkyl", "haloalkeriyl" and<br>
"haloalkoxy" means alkyl, alkenyl or alkoxy, as the case<br>
may be, substituted with one or more halogen atoms. The<br>

or sulfur and includes any oxidized form of nitrogen and<br>
sulfur, and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen.<br>
Also the term ^nitrogen" includes a substitutable<br>
nitrogen of a heterocyclic ring. As an example, in a<br>
saturated or partially unsaturated ring having 0-3<br>
heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the<br>
nitrogen may be K (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl), NH (as<br>
in pyrrolidinyl) or NR+ (as in N-substituted<br>
pyrrol idinyl) .<br>
 The terms "carbocycle", "carbocyclyl",<br>
"carbocyclo", or "carbocyclic" as used herein means an<br>
aliphatic ring system having three to fourteen members.<br>
The terms "carbocycle", "carbocyclyl", wcarbocyclo", or<br>
"carbocyclic" whether saturated or partially unsaturated,<br>

invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
 Topical application for the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
 For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in<br>
one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br><br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>

compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
 The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
 In addition to the compounds of this invention,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs of<br>
the compounds of this invention may also be employed in<br>
compositions to treat or prevent the above-identified<br>
diseases or disorders.<br>
 A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or<br>
prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
ester/ salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound<br>
of this invention which, upon administration to a<br>
recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or<br><br>
indirectly, a compound of this invention or an<br>
inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those<br>
that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of<br>
this invention when such compounds are administered to a<br>
patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered<br>
compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or<br>
which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a<br>
biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic<br>
system) relative to the parent species.<br>
 Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention include, without limitation,<br>
esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts<br>
and sulfonate esters.<br>
 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include those derived from<br>
phaxmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids<br>
and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include<br>
acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate,<br>

phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate,<br>
succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and<br>
undecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in<br>
themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed<br>
in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br><br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
 Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N+(C1_4 alkyl)4<br>
salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization<br>
of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds<br>
disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products may be obtained by such quaternization.<br>
 The amount of the protein kinase inhibitor that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
Preferably, the compositions should be formulated so that<br>
a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br>
the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving<br>
these compositions.<br>
 It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
the inhibitor will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound in the composition.<br>
 Depending upon the particular protein kinase-<br>
mediated condition to be treated or prevented, additional<br>
therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to<br>
treat or prevent that condition, may be administered<br>
together with the inhibitors of this invention. For<br>
example, in the treatment of diabetes other anti-diabetic<br><br>
agents may be combined with the GSK-3 inhibitors of this<br>
invention to treat diabetes. These agents include,<br>
•without limitation, insulin or insulin analogues, in<br>
injectable or inhalation form, glitazones, alpha<br>
glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides, insulin sensitizers,<br>
and sulfonyl ureas.<br>

agents for treating blood disorders such as<br>
corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth<br>
factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency<br>
disorders such as gamma globulin.<br>
 Those additional agents may be administered<br>
separately from the protein kinase inhibitor-containing<br>
composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen.<br><br>
Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single<br>
dosage form, mixed together with the protein kinase<br>
inhibitor of this invention in a single composition.<br>

 The compounds of this invention may be prepared<br>
as illustrated by the Synthetic Methods below, by the<br>
Synthetic Examples described herein and by general<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
General Synthetic Methods<br>
 The general synthetic methods below provide a<br>
series of general reaction routes that were used to<br>
prepare compounds of this invention. Methods A-F below<br>
are particularly useful for preparing formula II<br>
compounds. In most cases. Ring C is drawn as a phenyl<br>
ring bearing an ortho R1 substituent. However, it will be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art that compounds having<br>
other Ring C groups may be obtained in a similar manner.<br>
Methods analogous to methods A-F are also useful for<br>
preparing other compounds of this invention. Methods F-I<br>
below are particulary useful for preparing compounds of<br>
formula III or IV.<br><br>
 Method A is a general route for the preparation<br>
of compounds wherein ring C is an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
ring. Preparation of the starting dichloropyrimidine 1<br>
may be achieved in a manner similar to that described in<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull., 30, 9, 1982, 3121-3124. The chlorine<br>
in position 4 of intermediate 1 may be replaced by an<br>
aminopyrazole or aminoindazole to provide intermediate 2<br><br>
in a manner similar to that described in J. Med. Chem.,<br>
38, 3547-3557 (1995). Ring C is then introduced using a<br>
boronic ester under palladium catalysis (see Tetrahedron,<br>
48, 37, 1992, 8II7-8126). This method is illustrated by<br>
the following procedure.<br>
 A suspension of lff-quinazoline-2,4-dione (10.0<br>
g, 61.7 mmol) in POCl3 (60 mL, 644 mmol) and N,N-<br>
dimethylaniline (8mL, 63.1 mmol) is heated under reflux<br>
for 2 h. Excess POCl3 is evaporated under vacuum, the<br>
residue is poured into ice, and the precipitate is<br>
collected by filtration. The crude solid 2,4-<br>
dichloroquinazoline product may be used without further<br>
purification.<br>
 To a solution of 2,4-dichloro-quinazoline (3.3<br>
g, 16.6 mmol) in anhydrous ethanol (150 mL) is added 5-<br>
methyl-lH-pyxazol-3-yl amine (3.2 g, 32.9 mmol). The<br>
mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and the<br>
resulting precipitate is collected by filtration, washed<br>
with ethanol, and dried under vacuum to afford (2-chloro-<br>
quinazolin-4-yl)-(5-methyl-lH-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine.<br>
 To a solution of (2-chloro-guinazolin-4-yl) - (5-<br>
methyl-lH-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine (50 mg, 0.19 mmol) in DMF<br>
(1.0 mL) is added the desired arylboronic acid (0.38<br>
mmol), 2M Na2C03 (0.96 mmol), and tri-t-butylphosphine<br>
(0.19 mmol). Under-nitrogen, PdCl2(dppf) (0.0II mmol) is<br>
added in one portion. The reaction mixture is then<br>
heated at 80°C for 5 to 10 hours, cooled to room<br>
temperature, and poured into water (2 mL). The resulting<br>
precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with<br>
water, and purified by HPLC.<br><br><br>
 Methods B through F describe routes where the<br>
pyrazole ring system is introduced after Ring C and the .<br>
pyrimidine ring portion are first constructed. A<br>
versatile intermediate is the 4-chloropyrimidine 4, which<br>
is readily obtained from pyrimidinone 3 as shown in<br>
Method B(i). This reaction sequence is generally<br>
applicable for a variety of Ring C groups including<br>
aliphatic, aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl. See J.<br>
Med. Chem., 38, 3547-3557 (1995).<br>
 For quinazoline ring systems (where Rx and Ry<br>
are taken together to form a benzo ring) , the useful<br>
intermediate 6 may be obtained by condensing an<br>
anthranilic acid or its derivative with a benzamidine as<br>
shown in Method B(ii) or by condensing a benzoylchloride<br>
with an anthranilamide as shown in Method B(iii) . Many<br>
substituted anthranilic acid, anthranilamide, benzamidine<br>
and benzoylchloride starting materials may be obtained by<br><br>
known methods. See Aust. J. Chem., 38, 467-474 and J.<br>
Med. Chem., 38, 3547-3557 (1995). Method B(iii) is<br>
illustrated by the following procedure.<br>
 To a solution of anthranilamide (33 mmol) in<br>
THF and CH2Cl2 (1:1, 70 mL) is added the desired<br>
benzoylchloride (33 mmol) , and triethylamine (99 mmol) at<br>
room temperature. The mixture is stirred for about 14<br>
hours. The resulting precipitate is collected by<br>
filtration, washed with CH2cl2 and water, and dried under<br>
vacuum. The crude 2-behzoylaminobenzamide may be used<br>
directly for the next step without further purification.<br>
 To a solution of the above crude product (13<br>
mmol) in ethanol (50 mL) is added NaOEt (26 mmol) at room<br>
temperature. The mixture is heated under reflux for 48<br>
to 96 h. The solvent is evaporated and the "residue is<br>
neutralized using concentrated HC1 to pH 7. The product<br>
is then collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to<br>
provide 2-phenyl-3H-guinazolin-4-one that may be used<br>
without further purification.<br>
 To a suspension of the above product (12 mmol)<br>
in POC13 (120 mmol) is added tri-n-propylamine (24 mmol) .<br>
The mixture is heated under reflux for lh. After removal<br>
of the excess POC13. by evaporation, the residue is<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate, and washed with IN NaOH<br>
(twice) and water (twice). The organic layer is dried<br>
over MgS04, the solvent is evaporated under vacuum, and<br>
the crude product is purified by flash chromatography<br>
(eluting with 10% of ethyl actetate in hexanes) to give<br>
4-chloro-2-aryl guinazoline.<br>
 To a solution of 4-chloro-2-aryl guinazoline<br>
(0.16 mmol) in DMF (or THF, ethanol) (1 mL) is added the<br>
desired aminopyrazole or aminoindazole (0.32 mmol). The<br>
mixture is heated in DMF (or THF under reflux) at 100 to<br><br>
II0°C for 16 h (or in ethanol at 130-160°C for 16 hours)<br>
and then poured into water (2 mL) . The precipitate is<br>
collected by filtration and purified by HPLC.<br><br>
 Methods C and D(i) above employ p-ketoesters 8<br>
and 10, respectively, as pyrimidinone precursors. The<br>
substitution pattern of the Rx and Ry groups on the<br>
pyrimidinone ring will be reversed if a chlorocrotonate<br>
II (Synth. Comm, (1986), 997-1002), instead of the<br>
corresponding P-ketoester 10, is condensed with the<br>
desired benzamidine. These methods are illustrated by<br>
the following general procedure.<br>
 To a solution of a p-ketoester (5.2' mmol) and<br>
amidinium chloride (5.7 mtriol) in ethanol (5 mL) .is added<br>
sodium ethoxide (7.8 mmol). The mixture is heated under<br>
reflux for 7-14 hours. After evaporation the resulting<br>
residue is dissolved in water, acidified with<br>
concentrated HC1 to pH 6, and then filtered to obtain a<br>
solid product 2-aryl-3H-pyrimidin-4-one (yield 75-87%) ,<br><br>
which may be purified by flash column chromatography if<br>
needed. To this pyrimidinone (3.7 mmol) is added POC13 (4<br>
tnL) and n-Pr3N (1.4 mL) . The mixture is heated under<br>
reflux for 1 hour. After evaporation of the excess POC13,<br>
the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with IN<br>
NaOH solution (three times) and NaHCO3 (once) , and dried<br>
over MgS04. The solvent is removed under vacuum and the<br>
residue is purified by flash column chromatography<br>
eluting with 10% of ethyl acetate in hexanes to give 2-<br>
aryl-4-chloro-pyrimidine as a pale yellow syrup. This<br>
crude product may be treated with a 3-aminopyrazole or 3-<br>
aminoindazole as described above.<br><br>
 Method D(ii) above shows a general route for<br>
the preparation of the present compounds, such as<br>
compound 40, wherein Ry is N(R4)2. See II Farmaco, 52(1)<br>
61-65 (1997) . Displacement of the S-chloro group is<br>
exemplified here using morpholine. This method is<br>
illustrated by the following procedure.<br>
 To a solution of 2-methylmalonic acid diethyl<br>
ester (5 mmol) and sodium ethoxide (15 mmol) is added the<br><br>
appropriate amidine salt (5 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) and<br>
the reaction heated at reflux for 2-24 hours. The<br>
residue is dissolved in water and acidified with 2N HC1.<br>
The resulting precipitate is filtered off and further<br>
purified by flash chromatography (yield 5-35%) to afford<br>
the pyrimidinedione 37. To 37 (1.6 mmol) is added POC13<br>
(32 mmol) and tri-n-propylamine (6.4 mmol) and the<br>
reaction refluxed is for lh. After evaporation of excess<br>
POC13, the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate, basified<br>
with IN NaOH, separated and the aqueous phase twice more<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organics are<br>
dried (sodium sulfate) and evaporated. Purification by<br>
flash chromatography provides the dichloropyrimidine (38)<br>
as a yellow oil in 23% yield.<br>
 A solution of 38 (0.33 mmol) in methanol (5 mL)<br>
is treated with an amine, exemplified here using<br>
morpholine (0.64 mmol) and refluxed 1 hour. After<br>
evaporation of solvent, the residue is purified by flash<br>
chromatography to provide the mono-chloropyrimidine 39 as<br>
a colorless oil in 75% yield.<br>
 The mono-chloropyrimidine, 39, (0.19 mmol) may<br>
be treated with a 3-aminopyrazole or 3-aminoindazole<br>
compound in a manner substantially similar those<br>
described above in Methods A and B.<br><br><br>
(J. Org. Chem (1993), 58, 414-418; J.Med.Chem., (1992),<br>
35, 1515-1520; J.Org.Chem., 91967, 32, 313-214). This<br>
method is illustrated by the following general procedure.<br>
 The enamine is prepared according to w. White,<br>
et al,J. Org Chem. (1967), 32, 213-214. The acyl<br>
isocyanate is prepared according to G Bradley, et al, J<br>
Med. Chem. (1992), 35, 1515-1520. The coupling reaction<br>
then follows the procedure of S Kawamura, et al, J. Org.<br>
Chem, (1993), 58, 414-418. To the enamine (10 mmol) in<br>
tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) at 0°C under nitrogen is added<br>
dropwise over 5 min a solution of acyl isocyanate (10<br>
mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 tnL) . After stirring for 0.5<br>
h&gt; acetic acid (30 mL) is added, followed by ammonium<br>
acetate (50 mmol). The mixture is refluxed for 2 h with<br>
continuous removal of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is<br>
cooled to room temperature and is poured into water (100<br>
mL) . The precipitate is filtered, washed with water and<br>
ether and dried to provide the 2-aryl-3H-pyrimidin-4-one.<br><br>
 Method F shows a general route for the<br>
preparation of the present compounds wherein Rx and Ry are<br>
. taken together to form a 5-8 membered partially<br>
unsaturated saturated or unsaturated ring having 1-3<br>
heteroatoms. The condensation of a 2-amino-carboxylic<br>
acid, such as 2-amino-nicotinic acid 13, and an acid<br>
chloride 7 provides an oxazinone 14. Treatment of 14<br>
. with ammonium hydroxide will furnish the benzamide 15<br><br>
. which may be cyclized to a 2- (substituted) -pyrido [2,3-<br>
d] [l,3]pyrimidin-4-one 16. This method is illustrated by<br>
the following procedure.<br>
 2-(Trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride (4.2 ml,<br>
29.2 mmol) is added dropwise to a solution of 2-<br>
aminonicotinic acid (2.04g, 14.76 mmol) in 20 ml of<br>
pyridine. The reaction mixture is. heated at 158 C for 30<br>
min then cooled to room temperature. The reaction is<br>
poured into 200 ml of water and an oil forms which<br>
solidifies upon stirring. The solid is collected by<br>
vacuum filtration and washed with water and diethyl<br>
ether. The product is dried to give 2- (2-<br>
trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyrido[2, 3-d] [1,3]oxazin-4-one<br>
(2.56 g, 60% yield) which may be used in the next step<br>
without further purification.<br>
 2- (2-Trif luoromethyl-phenyl) -pyrido [2,3-<br>
d] [1,3] oxazin-4-one (2.51g) is stirred in 30% ammonium<br>
hydroxide (25 ml) at room temperature overnight. The<br>
resulting precipitate is filtered and rinsed with water<br>
and diethyl ether. The precipitate is dried under vacuum<br>
at 50 C overnight to give 2- (2-trifluoromethyl-<br>
benzoylamino) -nicotinamide (850 mg, 33% yield)<br>
 2- (2-Trifluoromethyl-benzoylamino) -nicotinamide<br>
(800mg, 2.6mmol) is dissolved in 10ml of ethanol.<br>
Potassium ethoxide (435mg, 5.2mmol) is added to the<br>
solution which is heated to reflux for 16 h. The<br>
reaction mixture is evaporated in vacuo to afford a gummy<br>
residue that is dissolved in water and acidified with 10%<br>
sodium hydrogen sulfate to pH 7. The resulting<br>
precipitate is filtered and dried under vacuum at 50 C to<br>
give 2 - (2 -trifluoromethyl-phenyl) -3H-pyrido [2,3-<br>
d] pyrimidin- 4 - one.<br><br>
Method G<br>
 Method G is analogous to Method B(i) above.<br>
This method is illustrated by the following general<br>
procedure.<br>
2- (3,4-Dichloro-phenyl) -3H-quinazolin-4-one<br>
(lg, 3.43 mmol) is suspended in phosphorus oxychloride (4<br>
mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at II0°C for 3<br>
hours. The solvents are then evaporated and the residue<br>
is treated carefully with an ice cold aqueous saturated<br>
solution of NaHCO3. The solid is collected by filtration<br>
and washed with ether to give 4-chloro-2- (3,5-dichloro-<br>
phenyl)-quinazoline as a white solid (993 mg, 93%).<br>
To 4-chloro-2- (3,5-dichloro-phenyl) -quinazoline<br>
(4.00mg, 1.29 mmol) in THF (30 mL) is added 3-amino-5-<br>
methyl pyrazole (396 mg, 2.S8 mmol) and the reaction<br>
mixture is heated at 65°C overnight. The solvents are<br>
then evaporated and the residue triturated with ethyl<br>
acetate, filtered and washed with a minimum amount of<br>
ethanol to give [2- (3,4-dichlorophenyl) -quinazolin-4-yl] -<br>
(5-methyl-2J?-pyrazol-3-yi)-amine as a white solid (3II mg<br>
65%): mp 274°C; XH NMR (DMSO) 8 2.34 (3H, s) , 6.69 (1H,<br>

 The THF solvent used, in'the previous step may<br>
be replaced by other organic solvents such as ethanol,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, or dioxane.<br>

 Method I above shows a general route for the<br>
preparation of the present compounds wherein ring D is a<br>
heteroaryl or heterocyclyl ring directly attached to the<br><br>
pyrimidine 2-position via a nitrogen atom. Displacement<br>
of the 2-chloro group, exemplified here using piperidine,<br>
may be carried out in a manner similar to that described<br>
in J. Med. Chem., 38, 2763-2773 (1995) and J. Chem. Soc.,<br>
176-6-1771 (1948) . This method is illustrated by the<br>
following procedure.<br>

(lfl"-indazol-3-yl)-amine (1 equivalent, 0.1-0.2 mmol) in<br>
N, N-dimethylacetamide (1 ml) is added the desired amine<br>
(3 equivalents) . ,The resulting mixture is maintained at<br>
100°C for 6 h and then purified by reverse-phase HPLC.<br><br>
 Method J above shows the preparation of<br>
compounds of formula V via the displacement of a chloro<br>
group from an appropriately substituted pyridyl ring.<br>
Method J(i) is a route for preparing compounds of formula<br>
Va (see Indian J. Chem. Sect.B, 35, 8., 1996, 871-873) .<br>
Method J(ii) is a route for preparing compounds of<br><br>
formula Vb (see Bioorg. Med. Chem.,6, 12, 1998, 2449-<br>
2458) . For convenience, the chloropyridines 21 and 23<br>
are shown with a phenyl substituent corresponding to Ring<br>
D of formula V. It would be apparent to one skilled in<br>
the art that Method J is also useful for preparing<br>
compounds of formula V wherein Ring D is heteroaryl,<br>
heterocyclyl, carbocyclyl or other aryl rings. Method J<br>
is illustrated by the following procedures.<br>
 Method J(i). (5-Methyl-2ff-pyrazol-3-yl) - (2-<br>
phenyl-quinolin-4-yl) -amine. To 4-chloro-2-<br>
phenylquinoline (J. Het. Chem., 20, 1983, 121-128)(0.53g,<br>
2.21 mmol) in diphenylether (5 mL) was added 3-amino-5-<br>
methylpyrazole (0.43g, 4.42 mmol) and the mixture was<br>
heated at 200°C overnight with stirring. To the cooled<br>
mixture was added petroleum ether (20 mL) and the<br>
resulting crude precipitate was filtered and further<br>
washed with petroleum ether. The crude solid was purified<br>
by flash chromatography (SiO2, gradient DCM-MeOH) to give<br>
the title compound as a white solid: mp 242-244°C; 1H NMR<br><br>

phenylisoquinoline (J. Het. Chem., 20, 1983, 121-<br>

amino-5-methylpyrazole (0.27g, 2.74 mmol) and potassium<br>
carbonate (o.57g, 4.13 mmol)and the mixture was heated<br>
under reflux for 6 hours. The mixture was cooled and the<br>
bulk of DMF was evaporated. The residue was extracted<br>
twice with ethyl acetate and the combined organic layers<br>
were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) , filtered and<br><br>
concentrated. The crude was purified by flash - .<br>
chromatography (SiO2, gradient DCM-MeOH) to give the title<br>

 Method K shows a route for the preparation of<br>
compounds of formula VI. A versatile starting material<br>
is 2,4,6-trichloro-[1,3,5]triazine 25 in which the<br>
chlorine substituents may be sequentially displaced. The<br>
displacement of one of the chlorines by an aryl Grignard<br>
reagent or an aryl boronic acid is described in PCT<br>
patent application WO 01/25220 and Helv. Chim. Acta, 33,<br>
1365 (1950). The displacement of one of the chlorines by<br>
a heteroaryl' ring is described in WO 01/25220; J. Het.<br>
Chem., II, 417 (1974); and Tetrahedron 31, 1879' (1975).<br>
These reactions provide a 2,4-dichloro-(6-<br>
substituted)[1,3,5]triazine 26 that is a useful<br>
intermediate for the preparation of compounds of formula<br>
VT. Alternatively, intermediate 26 may be obtained by<br>
constructing the triazine ring by known methods. See US<br>
patent 2,832,779; and US patent 2,691020 together with J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 60, 1656 (1938). In turn, one of the<br>
chlorines of 26 may be displaced as described above to<br>
provide 2-chloro-(4, 6-disubstituted) [1,3,5]triazine 27.<br><br><br>
 Method L shows a route for preparing compounds<br>
of formula VTI. For illustration purposes the<br>
trifluoromethylchalcone 28 is used as a starting<br>
material; however, it would be apparent to one skilled in<br>
the art that other rings may be used in place of the<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl and phenyl rings of compound 28.<br>
Substituted chalcones may be prepared by known methods,<br>
for example as described in the Indian J. Chemistry, 32B,<br>
449 (1993). Condensation of a chalcone with urea<br>
provides the pyrimidinone 29, which may be treated with<br>
POC13 to give the chloropyrimidine 30. See J. chem. Eng.<br>
Data, 30(4) 512 (1985) and Egypt. J. Chem., 37(3), 283<br><br>
(1994) . In an alternative approach to compound 30, one<br>
of the aryl rings attached to the pyrimidine is<br>
introduced by displacement of of the. 4-chloro group of<br>
2,4-dichloro- (6-aryl) -pyrimidine by an aryl boronic acid<br>
using a palladium catalyst such as (Ph3P)4Pd in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium carbonate as described<br>
in Bioorg. Med. Lett., 9(7), 1057 (1999).- Displacement<br>
of the chlorine of compound 30 by an appropriate<br>
aminopyrazole provides compounds of this invention, such<br>
as 31. The last step of this method is illustrated by<br>
the following procedure.<br>
 [4- (4-Methylpiperidin-l-yl) -pyrimidin-2-yl] - (5-<br>
methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-amine. To a solution of 2-<br>
chloro-4 - (4-methylpiperidin-1 -yl) -pyrimidine (prepared<br>
using a procedure similar to the one reported in Eur. J.<br>
Med. Chem., 26(7) 729(1991)) (222 mg, 1.05 mmol) in BuOH<br>
(5 mL) was added 3-amino-5-methyl-2H-pyrazole (305mg,<br>
3.15	mmol) and the reaction mixture was then heated under<br>
reflux overnight. The solvent was evaporated and the<br>
residue dissolved in a mixture ethanol/water (1/3, 4 mL) .<br>
Potassium carbonate (57mg, 0.41 mmol) was added and-the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The<br>
resulting suspension was filtered, washed with water<br>
twice and rinsed with ether twice to give the title .<br>

 Method M provides routes for obtaining<br>
compounds of formula VTII. A general procedure far<br>
displacing the chlorine of a 4-chloro-6-substituted-<br>
pyridazine, 32, with an appropriately substituted<br>
pyrazole to provide VTIIa is described in J. Het. Chem.,<br>
20, 1473 (1983) . Analogous reactions may be carried out<br>
as follows: (a) with 3-chloro-5-substituted-pyridazine,<br>
33, to provide VTIIb is described in J. Wed. Chem.,<br>
41(3), 3II (1998); (b) with 5-chloro-3-substituted-<br><br>
[1,2,4] triazine, 34, to provide VTIIc is described in<br>
Heterocydes, 26(12), 3259 (1987); and (c) with 3-chloro-<br>
5-substituted- [1,2,4] triazine, 35, to provide VXIXd is<br>
described in Pol. J. Chem., 57, 7, (1983); Xndian J".<br>

compounds of formula VTXlc is described in Indian J.<br>
Chew. Sect. B, 29(5), 435 (1990).<br>
 Compounds of formula IX are prepared by methods<br>
substantially similar to those described above for the<br>
pyrazole-containing compounds of formula I. Methods A-J<br>
may be used to prepare the triazole-containing compounds'<br>
of formula IX by replacing the amino-pyrazole compound<br>
with an amino-triazole compound. Such methods are<br>
specifically exemplified by Synthetic Examples 415-422<br>
set forth below. The amino-triazole intermediate may be<br>
obtained by methods described in J. Org. Chem. USSR, 27,<br>
952-957 (1991).<br>
 Certain synthetic intermediates that are useful<br>
for preparing the protein kinase inhibitors of this<br>
invention are. new. Accordingly, another aspect of this<br>
invention relates to a 3-aminoindazole compound of<br>
formula A:<br><br>
where R10 is one to three substituents that are each<br>
independently selected from fluoro, bromo, Ci-S haloalkyl,<br>
nitro, or 1-pyrrolyl. Examples of such compounds include<br>
the following:<br><br><br>
wherein Rx and Ry are as defined above; R1 is selected<br>
from Cl, F, CF3, CN, or NO2; and is one to three<br>
substituents that are each independently selected from H,<br>
Cl, F, CF3/ N02, or CN; provided that R1 and Rs are not<br>
simultaneously Cl. Examples of compounds of formula B<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING<br>
 The activity of the compounds as protein kinase<br>
inhibitors may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell<br>
line. In vitro assays include assays that determine<br>
inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or<br>
ATPase activity of the activated protein kinase.<br>
Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the<br>
inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase. Inhibitor<br>
binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor<br>
prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/protein kinase<br>
complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound.<br>
Alternatively, inhibitor binding, may be determined by<br>
running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are<br>
incubated with the protein kinase bound to known<br>
radioligands.<br>

inhibit GSK-3P (AA 1-420) activity using a standard<br>
coupled enzyme system (Fox et al. (1998) Protein Sci. 7,<br>
2249). Reactions were carried out in a solution<br>
containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) , 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl,<br>
300 ?M NADH, 1 mM DTT and 1.5% DMSO. Final substrate<br>
concentrations in the assay were 20 ?M ATP (Sigma<br>
Chemicals, St Louis, MO) and 300 ?M peptide<br>
(HSSPHQS(PO3H2)EDEEE, American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA) .<br>
Reactions were carried out at 30 °C and 20 nM GSK-3?.<br>
Final concentrations of the components of the coupled<br>
enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 300 ?M<br>
NADH, 30 ?g/ml pyruvate kinase and 10 ?g/ml lactate<br>
dehydrogenase.<br><br>
 An assay stock buffer solution was prepared<br>
containitig all of the reagents listed above with the<br>
exception of ATP and the test compound of interest. The<br>
assay stock buffer solution (175 ?l) was incubated in a<br>
96 well plate with 5 ?l of the test compound of interest<br>
at final concentrations spanning 0.002 ?M to 3 0 ?M at 30<br>
°C for 10 min. Typically, a 12 point titration was<br>
conducted by preparing serial dilutions (from 10 mM<br>
compound stocks) with DMSO of the test compounds in<br>
daughter plates. The reaction was initiated by the<br>
addition of 20 ?l of ATP (final concentration 20 ?M) .<br>
Rates of reaction were obtained using a Molecular Devices<br>
Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA) over 10 min at 30<br>
°C. The Ki values were determined from the rate data as a<br>
function of inhibitor concentration.<br>

 The compounds were assayed as inhibitors of<br>
full length recombinant human Src kinase (from Upstate<br>
Biotechnology, cat. no. 14-II7) expressed and purified<br>
from baculo viral cells. Src kinase activity was<br>
monitored by following the incorporation of 33P from ATP<br>
into the tyrosine of a random poly Glu-Tyr polymer<br>
substrate of composition, GlurTyr =4:1 (Sigma, cat. no.<br>
P-0275) . The following were the final concentrations of<br>

kinase and 10 jig/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
 In a typical assay, all the reaction components<br>
with the exception of ATP were pre-mixed and aliquoted<br>
into assay plate wells. Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO<br>
were added to the wells to give a filial DMSO' concentration<br>
of 2.5%. The assay plate was incubated at 30 C for 10 tnin<br>
before initiating the reaction with 100 juM ATP. The<br>
absorbance change at 340 nm with time, the rate of the<br>
reaction, was monitored on a molecular devices plate<br>
