COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTED PYRAZOLES"<br>
AVENTIS CROPSCIENCE S.A., of 55 avenue Rene cassin, CP 106, F-69266 LYON, Cedex 09, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted .  pyrazoles.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted pyrazoles and to their use as pesticidal compound.<br>
Pyrazoles such as 5-Amino-l-aryI-3-cyanopyrazole compounds and derivatives thereof, for example Fiproriil, form an important class of insecticides. Certain substituted 5-N-alkyl-N-alkoxyacetylamino-l-aryl-3-cyanopyrazoie compounds have valuable pesticidal properties as disclosed in WO00/35884 and US Patent No. 5,556,873.<br>
  US Patent No. 4931461 discloses substituted 5-methylamino-l-aryl pyrazoles and their use as pest-combating agents. These substituted compounds may be prepared in various ways but in particular it has been found that the compounds may be prepared by reacting the pyrazole with an alkylating agent. This preparation method, whilst being effective, produces by-products that must be isolated from the desired pesticidal compound.<br>
We have found an alternative route to the production of the aforementioned' compounds which reduces and substantially eliminates the presence of by-products, thus avoiding the need to purify, the final product.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process (A) for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
Rl is CN or CSNH2;<br>
X is N or CR4;<br>
-R2 and R4 are, each, independently hydrogen or chlorine;<br><br>
R3 is halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or -SF5;<br>
R5 and R6 are each independently an alkyl group; and<br>
n is 0, 1 or 2;<br>
which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
(II)<br>
wherein the various symbols are as defined above and W is H, with an alkylating agent of formula (HI):<br>
R6-Y<br>
(n)<br>
wherein R6 is as defined above and Y is a leaving group.<br>
This process provides the advantage over previously known processes in this process is more efficient and provides a more direct route to the final product.<br>
It has also been found that prior to reacting compound (II) with the alkylating agent, compound (II) may be reacted initially with an inorganic metal salt or an organic base, thereby forming an intermediate salt which is then reacted with the alkylating agent.<br>
Thus, according to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a process (A) for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
R1 is CN or CSNH2;<br>
X is N or CR4;<br>
R2 and R4 are, each, independently hydrogen or chlorine;<br>
R3 is halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or -SF5;<br>
R5 and R6 are each independently an alkyl group; and<br>
n is 0, 1 or 2;<br>
which process comprises (a) a first step of reacting a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
(II)<br>
wherein the various symbols are as defined above and W is H , with an inorganic metal salt or an organic base to produce an intermediate compound, (b) a second step of<br><br>
(Ill)<br>
wherein RP is as defined above and Y is a leaving group.<br>
The process of the present invention provides the advantage over the prior art in that there is no by-products produced during the reaction and that if desired, the intermediate compound may be prepared and isolated. The intermediate compound has been found to be stable.<br>
