				<td>Novel combination of glucocorticoids and PDE-4<br>
inhibitors for treating respiratory diseases, allergic<br>
diseases, asthma and COPD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel combination of<br>
a glucocorticoid, especially loteprednol, and at least<br>
one phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE-4 inhibitor),<br>
especially the hydroxyindole derivative N-(3,5-di-<br>
chloropyridin-4-yl)-2-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-<br>
hydroxyindol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide, for a simultaneous,<br>
sequential or separate administration in the treatment<br>
of respiratory diseases, allergic diseases, asthma and<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).<br>
Allergic diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
diseases (COPD) are based on inflammatory processes<br>
characterized by an increased number of inflammatory<br>
cells and increased release or secretion of<br>
inflammation mediators. Studies over the last 20 years<br>
have revealed that inflammation of the respiratory<br>
tract is of central importance for the respiratory<br>
dysfunction in asthma and COPD. Comparable changes have<br>
been observed in allergic inflammations of the nose and<br>
of the eyes. Normally, the mucosa is infiltrated by a .<br>
large number of cells, including mast cells,<br>
eosinophils and lymphocytes. These cells release a<br>
number of mediators, including in particular<br>
interleukin-4 (IL-4), GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage<br>
colony-stimulating factor) and the tumor necrosis<br>
factor a (TNF-a), which eventually bring about the<br>
inflammations and the symptoms of allergic diseases and<br>
of COPD.<br>
At the present time, a similar anti-inflammatory<br>
therapeutic approach is followed for all allergic<br>
diseases. The pathology of these diseases has revealed<br>
that the inflammatory process in the mucosa of patients<br>
primarily determines the symptom activity. Of the anti-<br>
inflammatory compounds currently available for the<br>
treatment of asthma, rhinitis or conjunctivitis,<br>
glucocorticoids are the most effective. Active<br>
ingredients which can be administered topically by<br>
inhalational, intranasal or intraocular administration<br>
are preferably employed. On the basis of the successful<br>
use of inhalable glucocorticoids in the treatment and<br>
prevention of respiratory inflammations and permanent<br>
lung damage in asthma patients, this therapeutic<br>
approach has also been applied to COPD patients<br>
although there are no data which might unambiguously<br>
prove a long-term efficacy of these active ingredients<br>
in COPD patients (Whittaker AJ, Spiro SG; Curr Opin<br>
Pulm Med 2000; 6:104-9).<br>
One of the most important anti-inflammatory properties<br>
of glucocorticoids arises from inhibition of cytokine<br>
release. It is known that several cytokines such as IL-<br>
4, IL-5, GM-CSF and TNF-oc are involved in respiratory<br>
inflammation. The efficacy of glucocorticoids can in<br>
part be explained by the inhibitory effect on cytokine<br>
synthesis and cytokine release (Marx et al.; Pulm<br>
Pharimacol Ther 2002; 15:7-15) .<br>
One disadvantage of glucocorticoids arises from their<br>
possible systemic side effects such as, for example,<br>
growth retardation or else osteoporosis. Sensible<br>
measures for reducing the risk of side effects on<br>
topical administration of glucocorticoids include the<br>
use of the minimum effective dose or restriction of the<br>
systemic availability of the active ingredient. A novel<br>
route is opened up by the use of so-called soft<br>
steroids. In contrast to other glucocorticoids, most of<br>
which undergo degradation to pharmacodynamically<br>
inactive metabolites only in the liver, the soft<br>
steroids undergo partial metabolic inactivation even at<br>
the site of their administration (intranasal, ocular or<br>
intrapulmonary). Following this partial local<br>
metabolism, only very little, or no,<br>
pharmacodynamically active substance reaches the<br>
systemic blood circulation, so that the steroid-<br>
specific side effects are not to be expected in<br>
practice. The most prominent example of this novel<br>
class of active ingredients is loteprednol, which is<br>
already approved for the therapy of allergic<br>
conjunctivitis and uveitis.<br>
A further class of potential therapeutics for allergic<br>
diseases and COPD comprises the phosphodiesterase-4<br>
inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase enzymes are responsible<br>
for the inactivation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate<br>
(cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).<br>
Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4 leads to an increase<br>
in cAMP in the cells, in turn leading to downregulation<br>
of the function of virtually all proinflammatory cells<br>
or immune cells. It is of interest that inflammatory<br>
cells involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as<br>
asthma, conjunctivitis, rhinitis or chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disease preferentially express the<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 enzymes.<br>
In recent years there have been advances in the<br>
development of phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors which can<br>
be employed for the therapy of allergic diseases,<br>
asthma or COPD. It has been possible to show the in<br>
vitro inhibitory activity on cytokine release and the<br>
therapeutic efficacy in asthma models for example for<br>
the active ingredients roflumilast, cilomilast or else<br>
piclamilast (Torphy et al.; Pulm Pharmacol Ther 1999;<br>
12:131-5; Poppe et al.; Allergy 2000; 55(Suppl 63):270;<br>
Giembycz MA; Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2001; 10:1361-<br>
79; Ezeamuzie CI; Eur J Pharmacol 2001; 417:11-8).<br>
There is particular interest in a novel class of<br>
substituted hydroxyindol.es which are described in<br>
DE 19 818 964, DE 19 917 504 and US 6,251,923, and also<br>
novel 7-azaindoles which are dissclosed in DE 10 053 275<br>
and PCT/EP 01/12376.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the novel<br>
combination of a glucocorticoid with at least one<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor is advantageous in the<br>
treatment of respiratory diseases, allergic diseases,<br>
asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.<br>
Add-on therapy of a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor,<br>
especially the hydroxyindole derivative N-(3,5-<br>
dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-[l-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-<br>
hydroxyindol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide, which can be<br>
administered orally, intranasally or by inhalation,<br>
with topical glucocorticoids, especially loteprednol,<br>
is distinguished by improved therapeutic efficacy as<br>
well as by the occurrence of /few side effects.<br>
The invention serves to improve the therapy of<br>
respiratory diseases, allergic diseases, asthma and<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, as well as the<br>
prophylaxis thereof. It is possible with a<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor present in the<br>
combination and with a glucocorticoid successfully to<br>
control the inflammations which underlie the<br>
pathological states. Moreover, add-on therapy with<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor leads to a smaller use of<br>
glucocorticoids, thus reducing the risk of side<br>
effects.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a<br>
composition which comprises a glucocorticoid and at<br>
least one phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in fixed or<br>
free combination, and to the use thereof for producing<br>
a medicament. The invention also relates to a<br>
medicament for the treatment of respiratory diseases,<br>
allergic diseases, asthma and/or chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary diseases, which comprises as active<br>
ingredient a glucocorticoid and at least one<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in fixed or free<br>
combination, and to a process for the production<br>
thereof.<br>
It is possible to employ all glucocorticoids for the<br>
purposes of the present invention. So-called soft<br>
steroids are preferably used. The examples which may be<br>
cited of glucocorticoids which can be employed<br>
according to the invention are beclomethasone (9-<br>
chloro-llb,17,21-trihydroxy-16b-methyl-l,4-pregnadiene-<br>
3,20-dione),. especially beclomethasone dipropionate,<br>
budesonide (16a,17-butylidenedioxy-11b, 21-dihydroxy-<br>
1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione), ciclesonide (see, for<br>
example, WO 98/52542 and literature cited therein),<br>
fluticasone (S-(fluoromethyl) 6a,9-difluoro-llp-<br>
carbothioate), especially fluticasone propionate,<br>
mometasone (9,21-dichloro-11b,17-dihydroxy-16a-methyl-<br>
1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione), in particular mometasone<br>
furoate, and loteprednol, especially loteprednol<br>
etabonate (chloromethyl 17a-[(ethoxycarbonyl)oxy]-11b-<br>
hydroxy-3-oxoandrosta-l,4-diene-17b-carboxylate).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, loteprednol<br>
and its pharmaceutically acceptable esters, especially<br>
loteprednol etabonate, is used as soft steroid. The<br>
preparation of loteprednol and loteprednol etabonate is<br>
described for example in the German patent<br>
DE 3 126 732, the corresponding US patent 4,996,335 and<br>
the corresponding Japanese patent JP-89011037.<br>
Further soft steroids suitable according to the<br>
invention are described for example in the German<br>
patent DE 3 786 174, the corresponding patent<br>
EP 0 334 853 and the corresponding US patent 4,710,495.<br>
It is possible for the purposes of the present<br>
invention to employ all phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors.<br>
These include, in particular but not restrictively, the<br>
class of substituted hydroxyindole derivatives which<br>
are described in DE 19 818 964, DE 19 917 504 and<br>
US 6,251,923, and also novel 7-azaindole derivatives<br>
which are disclosed in DE 10 053 275 and<br>
PCT/EP 01/12376. Examples of phosphodiesterase-4<br>
inhibitors which can be used according to the invention<br>
are rolipram ((R)-4-[3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-<br>
methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidinone), roflumilast (Byk-<br>
Gulden), piclamilast (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), cilomilast<br>
(GlaxoSmithKline) and the hydroxyindole derivative<br>
N- (3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-<br>
hydroxyindol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide. Particular<br>
preference is given to the substituted hydroxyindole<br>
derivative N-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-[1-(4-fluoro-<br>
benzyl) -5-hydroxyindol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide ("DFHO"<br>
hereinafter), which is described for example in DE 19<br>
818 964. The phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors can also be<br>
employed as pharmaceutically acceptable salts as are<br>
known to the skilled worker.<br>
The inventive combination of a glucocorticoid, in<br>
particular of a soft steroid, with at least one<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor can be administered both<br>
prophylactically and after appearance of symptoms. They<br>
can also be used to retard or prevent progression of<br>
the diseases.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a combination of the active<br>
ingredients loteprednol etabonate and N-(3,5-<br>
dichloropyridin-4-yl) -2- [1- (4-fluorobenzyl) -5-hydroxy-<br>
indol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide (DFHO) is used.<br>
The following description of experiments serves to<br>
explain the inventive teaching in detail without<br>
restricting it.<br>
Inhibition of GM-CSF release from LPS-stimulated<br>
monocytes<br>
EDTAized human whole blood was mixed with Hanks" buffer<br>
in the ratio 1:1. Histopaque 1077 solution (15 ml) was<br>
cautiously overlaid with max. 40 ml of the blood:<br>
Hanks" mixture and centrifuged (2000 rpm) at room<br>
temperature for 30 min. The band enriched with<br>
leukocytes was aspirated off, washed twice with Hanks"<br>
buffer and transferred into RPMI 164 0 medium with<br>
Glutamax I (Gibco BRL, Eggenstein). The monocytes were<br>
removed through their adherence to the cell culture<br>
bottle over a period of two hours. The cells were then<br>
thoroughly washed with medium in order to remove non-<br>
adherent cells. The resulting monocytes were cultured<br>
in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal<br>
calf"s serum (FCS) and 100 U/ml penicillin and<br>
100 mg/ml streptomycin in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 96%<br>
relative humidity, 37°C).<br>
Primary monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates at 5x105<br>
cells/well. The cells were preincubated with the stated<br>
test substances for 30 minutes. LPS was then added, and<br>
incubation was continued for a period of 24 h. The<br>
supernatants were aspirated off and investigated by<br>
ELISA.<br>
The amount of secreted human GM-CSF in the cell culture<br>
supernatants was determined by using an OptEIA™ human<br>
GM-CSF ELISA test (Pharmingen, San Diego). It was<br>
carried out in microtiter plates. Anti-human monoclonal<br>
antibodies were coupled as antibodies to the plate at<br>
4°C overnight. This coating and three washes were<br>
followed by saturation of nonspecific bindings by means<br>
of assay diluent solution™ (PBS with 10% FCS, pH 7.0)<br>
(Pharmingen, San Diego) at RT for 1 h. This was<br>
followed by incubation with the samples and the<br>
standard (recombinant human GM-CSF) at 4°C overnight.<br>
The samples were prepared undiluted or in a dilution of<br>
1:50, of the standard dilutions according to the<br>
protocol starting from a stock solution with 500 pg/ml<br>
human GM-CSF. Bound human GM-CSF was detected with the<br>
aid of biotinylated monoclonal anti-human GM-CSF<br>
antibodies and an avidin-horseradish peroxidase reagent<br>
at RT for 1 h. All the steps were followed by washing 5<br>
or 7 times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20. The enzyme activity<br>
was determined using substrate solution™<br>
(tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide,<br>
Pharmingen, San Diego) as substrate at RT for 30 min.<br>
The enzyme-substrate reaction was stopped with 1M<br>
phosphoric acid, and the extinction at 450 nm was<br>
measured.<br>
Results<br>
Firstly, dose-activity plots were established<br>
separately for N-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-[1-(4-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-5-hydroxyindol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide<br>
(DFHO) and loteprednol. From these, the IC50 for GM-CSF<br>
release from human monocytes was calculated<br>
respectively as 3.2 mM for DFHO and 53.7 nM for<br>
loteprednol. In further experiments, IC50 values for<br>
DFHO and loteprednol were established in the presence<br>
of sub-IC50 concentrations of the respective other<br>
substance. In these cases, addition of 5 nM DFHO<br>
lowered the IC50 for loteprednol from 53.7 nM to<br>
13.4 nM. Conversely, addition of 10 nM loteprednol<br>
lowered the IC50 for DFHO from 3.2 mM to 0.06 mM.<br>
The IC50 values found for loteprednol for release of TNF<br>
and of GM-CSF from LPS-stimulated monocytes correspond<br>
to the IC50 values indicated in the literature for other<br>
cell systems. This means that the cell system used is<br>
valid and suitable, and the investigations which are<br>
necessary for the aim of the project with this system<br>
come to a reliable conclusion. The IC50 values for DFHO<br>
correspond to those values indicated in the patent<br>
literature.<br>
When 5 nM DFHO was given, the reduction in the IC50 for<br>
loteprednol for TNF release was 65% and for GM-CSF<br>
release was 75%. The concentration of 5 nM DFHO is far<br>
below the IC50 for this substance, which is respectively<br>
5.7 uM and 3.2 mM, so that no effect is to be observed<br>
when 5 nM DFHO is given on its own.<br>
Conversely, the reduction in the IC50 for DFHO for TNF<br>
release was 99% and for GM-CSF release was 98% when<br>
10 nM loteprednol was given . simultaneously. The<br>
concentration of 10 hM loteprednol is far below the IC50<br>
of this substance, which is 85.5 nM and 53.7 nM<br>
respectively, so that no effect is to be observed when<br>
10 nM loteprednol is given on its own.<br>
A surprising observation which could not have been<br>
predicted by the skilled worker is that there is here a<br>
superadditive effect brought about by the simultaneous<br>
administration of loteprednol and DFHO on the<br>
inhibition of TNF and GM-CSF release.<br>
The dosage forms mentioned below are particularly<br>
suitable for administration of the inventive<br>
combination of active ingredients.<br>
Thus, the active ingredients present in the combination<br>
can for example be administered separately as two oral<br>
formulations, or one active ingredient is in the form<br>
of an oral formulation and the other is in topical form<br>
(intranasal, inhalational).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor can be administered<br>
orally. Customary pharmaceutical formulations are used<br>
in this case, such as tablets, syrup, capsules,<br>
preparations with slowed release (sustained release<br>
formulation), pastilles or effervescent granules.<br>
Solid pharmaceutical forms such as tablets may comprise<br>
inert ingredients and carriers such as, for example,<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate,<br>
lactose, starch, mannitol, alginates, gelatin, guar<br>
gum, magnesium stearate or aluminum stearate, methyl-<br>
cellulose, talc, colloidal silicas, silicone oil, high<br>
molecular weight fatty acids (such as stearic acid),<br>
agar-agar or vegetable or animal fats and oils, solid<br>
high molecular weight polymers (such as polyethylene<br>
glycol); preparations suitable for oral administrations<br>
may, where appropriate, comprise additional flavorings<br>
or sweeteners. The compositions in capsule form can be<br>
produced by generally customary processes, for example<br>
by using the aforementioned carriers in a hard gelatin<br>
capsule shell. For compositions in the form of soft<br>
gelatin capsules it is possible to employ<br>
pharmaceutical carriers normally used for producing<br>
dispersions or suspensions, such as, for example,<br>
aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils, which are<br>
incorporated into a soft gelatin capsule shell. Syrup<br>
formulations normally consist of a suspension or<br>
solution of the compound or of a salt thereof in a<br>
liquid carrier such as, for example, ethanol, peanut<br>
oil, olive oil, glycerol or water, it being possible<br>
for flavorings and colorants to be present.<br>
It is possible through topical administration of the<br>
inventive combination of active ingredients to achieve<br>
therapeutically effective concentrations even with<br>
lower dosages. For this reason, topical formulations,<br>
which include in particular intranasal and inhalational<br>
formulations, are preferred for the purposes of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Intranasal preparations may be administered as aqueous<br>
or oily solutions, suspensions or emulsions. For the<br>
administration of an active ingredient by inhalation,<br>
it can be administered in the form of a suspension,<br>
solution or emulsion which is present as dry powder or<br>
as aerosol, it being possible to use all customary<br>
propellants.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor composition is in the<br>
form of a nasal spray or of a metered aerosol or of a<br>
metered dry powder for inhalation. The glucocorticoid<br>
composition is preferably likewise a topical<br>
preparation, and for the soft steroid loteprednol a<br>
formulation in the form of nasal spray, metered aerosol<br>
or metered dry powder for inhalation is again<br>
preferred.<br>
The soft steroid loteprednol etabonate employed<br>
according to the invention is preferably formulated as<br>
suspension in water, with further ingredients such as<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, tonicity agents,<br>
thickeners, suspension stabilizers, excipients to<br>
adjust the pH, buffer systems and wetting agents. For<br>
further details of suitable excipients, reference is<br>
made for example to DE 19 947 234.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention may,<br>
besides the glucocorticoid and at least one<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor active ingredients,<br>
comprise further ingredients such as customary<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, thickeners, flavorings,<br>
etc.<br>
Exemplary embodiment<br>
Nasal spray suspension with loteprednol etabonate (1%)<br>
Production<br>
Introduce 45 kg of purified water into a suitable<br>
agitating container with homogenizing device, and<br>
homogenize Avicel RC 591 therein at high speed. Then<br>
dissolve the substances polysorbate 80, sorbitol<br>
solution, sodium edetate and benzalkonium chloride<br>
together while agitating.<br>
Subsequently homogenize the active ingredient<br>
loteprednol etabonate at high speed until a uniform<br>
suspension is produced. Then make up the final volume<br>
with purified water and homogenize further.<br>
Subsequently evacuate the suspension in order to remove<br>
the air bubbles which have been produced. The resulting<br>
suspension is subsequently dispensed into bottles which<br>
are then provided with a suitable nasal spray pump.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the active components of<br>
this combination are in the form of a fixed<br>
combination, thus simplifying use for the patient.<br>
Administration of the active ingredients can in this<br>
case take place simultaneously, sequentially or<br>
separately in free or fixed combination. They can be<br>
administered both in a single-dose form and as two<br>
separate formulations, which may be identical or<br>
different. Delivery can take place at the same time,<br>
simultaneously, or at separate times, by which is meant<br>
both short and long intervals such as, for example,<br>
administration of loteprednol in the evening and<br>
administration of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in<br>
the morning, or vice versa.<br>
The active ingredients can be administered from once to<br>
six times a day. The active ingredients are preferably<br>
administered once to twice a day, particularly<br>
preferably twice a day. The dose of one or more<br>
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors is approximately from<br>
0.1 to 20 mg per day per adult, preferably between 0.2<br>
and 5 mg. The dose of the glucocorticoid can be in the<br>
region of the approved dosage, i.e. in the range from<br>
0.1 to 1.6 mg per day, preferably between 0.2 and<br>
0.8 mg per day. The actual dose depends on the general<br>
condition of the patients (age, weight, etc.) and the<br>
severity of the disease.<br>
