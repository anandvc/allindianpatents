Biogenic aroine transporters control the amount of biogenic amine neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Inhibition of  the respective transporter leads to a rise in theconcentration of that neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft. Compounds of formula (I)I and their phannaceuticaUy acceptable salts preferably exhibit a Ki value less than 600nM at the norepinephrine transporter as determined using the scintillation proximity assay described below. More preferred compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts exhibit a Kj value less man100nM at the norepinephrine transporter. Still more preferred compounds of formula (I) and their phannaceuticaUy acceptable salts exhibit a Ki value less than 50nM at the norepinephrine transporter. Especially preferredcompounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit a Kj valueless than 20nM at the norepinephrine transporter. Preferably, compounds of the presentinvention selectively inhibit the norepinephrine transporter relative to the serotonin anddopanune transporters by a factor of at least five, more preferably by a factor of at leastten using the scintillation proximity assays described below.In addition, the compounds of the present invention are preferably acid stable. Advantageously, they have a reduced interaction (both as substrate and inhibitor) with the liver enzyme Cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6). That is to say, they preferably exhibit less than 75% metabolism via the CYP2D6 pathway according to the CYP2D6 substrate assay described below and they preferably exhibit an IC50 of &gt;6uM according to the CYP2D6 inhibitor assay described below.In view of their pharmacological activity, the compounds of the present invention are indicated for the treatment of disorders of the central and/or peripheral nervous system, in particular, disorders associated with norepmephrine dysfunction in mammals, especially humans, including children, adolescents and adults.The term "norepinephrine dysfunction" as used herein refers to a reduction hi the amount of norepinephrine neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft below that which would be considered to be normal or desirable for a species, or an individual within that species. Thus the phrase "disorders associated with norepinephrine dysfunction in mammals" refers to disorders which are associated with a reduction in the amount of norepinephrine neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft below that which would be considered to be normal or desirable for the mammalian species, or an individual within the species, in question. Disorders associated with norepinephrine dysfunction in mammals include, for example, nervous system conditions selected from the group consisting of an addictive disorder and withdrawal syndrome, an adjustment disorder (including depressed mood, anxiety, mixed anxiety and depressed mood, disturbance of conduct, and mixed disturbance of conduct and mood), an age-associated learning and mental disorder (including Alzheimer's disease), alcohol addiction, allergies (in particular allergic rhinitis), anorexia nervosa, apathy, asthma, an attention-deficit disorder (ADD) due to general medical conditions, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) including the predominantly inattentive type of ADHD and the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD (and optionally by way of combination therapy with one or more stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine), bipolar disorder, bulimia nervosa, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic or acute stress, cognitive disorders (discussed in more detail below but including delusions, dementias, amnestic disorders, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) and cognitive disorders not otherwise specified), communication disorders (including stuttering, expressive language disorder, mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, phonological disorder and communication disorder not otherwise specified), conduct disorder, cyclothymic disorder, dementia of the Alzheimers type (DAT), depression (including adolescent depression and minor depression), dysthymic disorder, emotional dysregulation (including emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and intermittent explosive disorder), fibromyalgia and other somatofonn disorders (including somatization disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, hypocpondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatofonn disorder NOS), generalized anxiety disorder, hot flashes or vasomotor symptoms, hypotensive states including orthostatic hypotension, impulse control disorders (including intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pyromania, pathological gambling, trichotillomania and impulse-control disorder not otherwise specified), incontinence (i.e. bedwetting, stress incontinence, genuine stress<br>

The compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. The compounds of the present invention are also particularly suitable for the treatment of schizophrenia.The term "cognitive disorders" (also variously referred to as "cognitive failure," "cognitive insufficiency," "cognitive deficit," "cognitive impairment," "cognitive dysfunction," and the like) refers to the dysfunction, diminution, or loss of one or more cognitive functions, the processes by which knowledge is acquired, retained, and used. Cognitive dysfunction includes cognitive changes associated with ageing ("age-associated memory mpairment"), as well as changes due to other causes. Cognitive impainnent is most commonly due to a delirium or dementia, but can also occur in association with a number of other medical or neuropsychiatric disorders. More focal cognitive deficits are diagnosed using the criteria disclosed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR™, 2000), American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C., as either amnestic disorders (affecting memory) or cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), which includes executive dysfunction, visuospatial/visuocontructional impairment, attentional deficits, disorientation, etc. These more focal cognitive disorders also have a wide variety of causes, some of which are of unknown etiology.A delerium is characterized by a disturbance of consciousness with a reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention and a change in cognition that develops over a short period of time. Delirium is very common, and occurs on average in about a fifth of general hospital inpatients, and is even more common in nursing home patients and those with terminal illnesses. The disorders included in the "Delirium" section of the DSM-IV-TR™ are listed according to presumed etiology: Delirium Due to a General Medical Condition, ubstance-Induced Delirium (i.e., due to a drug of abuse, a medication, or toxin exposure), Delirium Due to Multiple Etiologies, or Delirium Not OtherwiseSpecified (if the etiology is indeterminate). As disclosed by Wise et al. ((2002) Delirium (Confusional States), In Wise and Rundell, Eds., The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Psychiatry in the Medically III, Second Edition, American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., Washington, D.C., Chapter 15, pp. 257-272, Table 15-4), exemplary etiological bases of delirium include, but are not limited to, infection, withdrawal from alcohol and drugs, acute metabolic conditions, trauma of various^ types, CNS pathologies, hypoxia, vitamin deficiencies, endocrinopathies, acute vascular conditions, toxins or drugs, and heavy metals.A dementia is a chronic condition, usually with a more gradual deterioration of memory and other intellectual functioning and other cognitive skills severe enough to interfere with the ability to perform activities of daily living. Although dementia may occur at any age, it primarily affects the elderly, presenting in more than 15% of persons over 65 years of age aiod in as many as 40% of persons over 80 years old. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is particularly common. Non-Alzheimer's cognitive impairments and/or dementias include, for example, those caused by or associated with: vascular diseases; Parkinson's disease; Lewy body disease (diffuse Lewy body disease); HIV/AIDS; mild cognitive impairments; mild neurocogoitive disorders; age-associated memory impairments; neurologic and/or psychiatric conditions including epilepsy and epilepsy treatments; brain tumors, cysts, lesions, or other inflammatory brain diseases; multiple sclerosis;; Down's syndrome; Rett's syndrome; progressive supranuclear palsy; frontal lobe dementia syndromes; schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders; antipsychotic medications; traumatic brain injury (closed head injury), dementia pugilistica, and other head traumas; normal-pressure hydrocephalus; surgery (including coronary artery by-pass graft surgery) and anaesthesia, electroconvulsive shock therapy, and cancer and cancer therapiesj.The dementias are also listed in the "Dementia" section of the DSM-IV-TR™ accordingto presumed etiology: Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type, Vascular Deentia, Dementiai Due to Other General Medical Conditions (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV disease, Head trauma, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), Substance-Induced Persisting Dementia (i.e., due to a drug of abuse, a medication, or toxin exposure), Dementia Due to Multiple Etiologies, or Dementia Not Otherwise Specified (if the etiology is indeterminate). As disclosed by Gray and Cummings ((2002) Dementia, In Wise and Rundell, Eds., The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Psychiatry in the Medically III, Second Edition, American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., Washington, D.C., Chapter 16, pp. 273-306, Table 16-1), exemplary etiological bases of principal dementia syndromes include, but are not limited to, degenerative disorders (cortical and subcortical), vascular disorders, myelinoclastic disorders, traumatic conditions, neoplastic disorders, hydrocephalic disorders, inflammatory conditions, infections, toxic conditions, metabolic disorders, and psychiatric disorders.An amnestic disorder is characterized by memory impairment in the absence of other significant accompanying cognitive impairments. The disorders in the "Amnestic Disorders" section of the DSM-IV-TR™ are also listed according to presumed etiology: Amnestic Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition, Substance-Induced Persisting Amnestic Disorder, or Amnestic Disorder Not Otherwise pecified.Cognitive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified in the DSM-IV-TR™ covers presentations that are characterized by cognitive dysfunction presumed to be due to either a general medical condition or substance use that do not meet criteria for any of the disorders Usted elsewhere in the section of the DSM-IV-TR™ entitled 'Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders."Dementia, amnestic disorders, and cognitive disorders NOS occur in patients with a wide variety of other disorders including, but not limited to, Huntington's disease (chorea); Pick's disease; pinocerebellar ataxias (types 1-11); corticobasalganglionic degeneration; neuroacanthocytosis; dentatorubropallidoluysian atropy (DRPLA); systemic lupus erythematosus; heavy metal intoxication; alcoholic dementia (Wemicke's encephalopathy); fetal alcohol syndrome; single or multiples strokes, including small vessels (Binswanger's dementia: subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy) and large vessels (multi-infarct dementia); anoxic encephalopathy; tumors; birth anoxia; premature birth; inborn errors of metabolism; neurofibromatosis (Type I); tuberous sclerosis; Hallervorden Spate disease; Wilson's disease; post-infectious sequelae (e.g., tuberculosis,viral encephalitis, bacterial meningitis); subdural hematoma; subcortical dementia; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease; general paresis; and syphilis.As discussed in detail above, cognitive failure may present in patients suffering from a number of disorders, including dementia or delirium, or due to a wide variety of other causes. The compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment or prevention of cognitive failure associated with, or due to, the disorders or etiologies discussed above, including disorders formally classified in the DSM-IV-TR™.

In Vitro Determination of the Interaction of compounds with CYP2D6 in Human Hepatic<br>
i Microsomes<br>
Cytocjirome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a mammalian enzyme which is commonly associated with the metabolism of around 30% of pharmaceutical compounds. Moreover, this enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism, resulting in the presence of both normal and poor metabolizers in the population. A low involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of compounds (i.e. the compound being a poor substrate of CYP2D6) is desirable in order to reduce any variability from subject to subject in the pharmacokinetics of the compound. Also, compounds with a low inhihibitor potential for CYP2D6 are desirable in order to avoid drug-drug interactions with co-administered drugs mat are substrates of CYP2D6.<br>
Compounds may be tested both as substrates and as inhibitors of this enzyme by means of<br><br>
the following assays.CYP2p6 substrate assayPrinciple:<br>
This assay determines the extent of the CYP2D6 enzyme involvement in the total<br>
oxidat ve metabolism of a compound in microsomes. Preferred compounds of the present<br>
invention exhibit less man 75% total metabolism via the CYP2D6 pathway.For this in vitro assay, the extent of oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes (HLM) is determined after a 30 minute incubation in the absence and presence of Quinidine, a specific chemical inhibitor of CYP2D6. The difference in the extent of metabolism in absence and presence of the inhibitor indicates the involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of the compound.Materials and Methods:<br>
Human liver microsomes (mixture of 20 different donors, mixed gender) are acquired from Human Biologies (Scottsdale, AZ, USA). Quinidine and p-NADPH (p-Niqotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate, reduced form, tetrasodium salt) are purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). All the other reagents and solvents are of analytical grade. A stock solution of the new chemical entity (NCE) is prepared in a<br>
mixture of Acetonitrile/Water to reach a final concentration of acetonitrile in the incubation below 0.5%.The microsomal incubation mixture (total volume 0.1 mL) contains the NCE (-NADPH (1 mM), microsomal proteins (0.5 mg/mL), and Quinidine (0 or 2 uM) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C in a shaking waterbath. The reaction is terminated by the addition of acetonitrile (75 uL). The samples are vortexed and the denaturated proteins are removed by centrifugation. The amount of NCE in the supernatant is analyzed by liquid chromatography /mass spectrometry (LC/MS) after addition of an internal standard. A sample is also taken at the start of the incubation (t=0), and analysed similarly.Analysis of me NCE is performed by liquid chromatography /mass spectrometry. Ten ML of diluted samples (20 fold dilution in the mobile phase) are injected onto a Spherisorb CN Column, 5 uM and 2.1 mm x 100 mm (Waters corp. Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase consisting of a mixture of Solvent A/Solvent B, 30/70 (v/v) is pumped (Alliance 2795, Waters corp. Milford, MA, USA) through the column at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/minute. Solvent A and Solvent B are a mixture of ammonium formate 5.1O*3 M pH 4.5/ methanol in the proportions 95/5 (v/v) and 10/90 (v/v), for solvent A and solvent B, respectively. The NCE and the internal standard are quantified by monitoring their molecular ion using a mass spectrometer ZMD or ZQ (Waters-Micromass corp, Machester, UK) operated in a positive electrospray ionisation.The extent of CYP2D6 involvement (% of CYP2D6 involvement) is calculated comparing the extent of metabolism in absence and in presence of quinidine in the incubation.The extent of metabolism without inhibitor (%) is calculated as follows:(NCE response in samples without inhibitor)time 0 - (NCE response in samples without inhibitor)time30    ... (NCE response in samples without inhibitor)timeO<br>
The extent of metabolism with inhibitor (%) is calculated as follows:<br>
; (NCE response in samples without inhibitor)tiineO-(NCE response hi samples with inhibitor)time30<br>
|	(NCE response in samples without inbibitor)time 0<br>
where the NCE response is the area of the NCE divided by the area of the internal standard in the LC/MS analysis chromatogram, timeO and time30 correspond to the 0 and 30 minutes incubation time.! The % of CYP2D6 involvement is calculated as follows :<br>
((% extent of metabolism without inhibitor) - (% extent of metabolism with inhibitor) % extent of metabolism without inhibitorCYP2D6 inhibitor assay Principle:<br>
The CYP2D6 inhibitor assay evaluates the potential far a compound, to inhibit CYP2E)6. This is performed by the measurement of the inhibition of the bufuralol 1 '-hydroxylase activity | by the compound compared to a control The 1 '-hydroxylation of bufuralol is a metabolic reaction specific to CYP2D6. Preferred compounds of the present invention exhibit an ICso higher than 6 uM for CYP2D6 activity, the ICso being the concentration of the compound that gives SO % of inhibition of the CYP2D6 activity.Material and methods:Human iliver microsomes (mixture of 20 different donors, mixed gender) are acquired from Human Biologies (Scottsdale, AZ). P-NADPH is purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Bufuralol is purchased from Ultrafine (Manchester, UK). All the other reagents and solvents are of analytical grade.Microspmal incubation mixture (total volume 0.1 mL) contains bufuralol 10 uM, β-NADPH (2 mM), microsomal proteins (0.5 mg/mL), and the new chemical entity (NCE) (0, 5, and 25 uM) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The mixture is incubated in a shaking waterbath at 37 °C for 5 minutes. The reaction is terminated by the additiori of methanol (75µL). The samples are vortexed and the denaturated proteins are removed by centrifugation. The supernatant is analyzed by liquid chromatographyconnected to a fluorescence detector. The formation of the 1 '-hydroxybufuralol is monitored in control samples (0 µM NCE) and in the samples incubated in presence of the NCE. The stock solution of NCE is prepared in a mixture of Acetomtrile/Water to reach a final concentration of acetonitrile in the incubation below 1.0%.The determination of 1 'hydroxybufuralol in the samples is performed by liquid chromatograhy with fluorimetric detection as described below. Twenty five µL samples are injected onto a Chromolith Performance RP-18e column (100 mm x 4.6 mm) (Merck KGAa, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase, consisting of a mixture of solvent A and solvent B whose proportions change according the following linear gradient, is pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1 ml min::(Table removed)Solvent A and Solvent B consist of a mixture of 0.02 M potassium dihydrogenophosphate buffer pH3/ methanol in the proportion 90/10 (v/v) for solvent A and 10/90 (v/v) for solvent B. The run time is 7.5 minutes. Fonnation of 1 '-hydroxybufuralol is monitored by fluorimetric detection with extinction at X 252 nm and emission at A, 302 nm.The ICso of the NCE for CYP2D6 is calculated by the measurement of the percent of inhibition of the formation of the 1'-hydroxybufuralol in presence of the NCE compared to control samples (no NCE) at a known concentration of the NCE.The percent of inhibition of the formation of the 1 '-hydroxybufuralol is calculated as follows:] fonned with inhibitor) (I'-hydroxybufuralol area formed with out inhibitor)The IC50 is calculated from the percent inhibition of the formation of the 1 '-hydroxybufuralol as follows (assuming competitive inhibition):NCE  Concentration x(lOO- Percent of inhibition) Percent of inhibitionThe IC50 estimation is assumed valid if inhibition is between 20% and 80% (Moody GC, Griffin SJ, Mather AN, McGinnity DF, Riley RJ. 1999.
