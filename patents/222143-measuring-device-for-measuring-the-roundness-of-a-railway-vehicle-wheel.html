				<td>Measuring instrument for measuring the roundness one <br>
Railway wheel<br>
The invention concerns measuring instrument at at least one rail. a railroad track for measuring the roundness of an individual railway wheel or the railway wheels of a wheel set during its run over the rail as difference of the extent radius of the flange crest and the radius of the bearing surface of the railway wheel in a plane of measurement. <br>
The roundness of a railway wheel is a criterion for the comfort of the railway vehicle. Wheels out of round energize natural oscillations of the vehicle, the rotary stand or the Wagenkastens, which are felt of the passengers as unpleasant noise and oscillations. <br>
The causes for of the railway wheels are complex and result from the run of the wheel arch surface on the rail. Out of roundnesses do not only arise simply for each to wheel revolution, it are also Polygone with 3, <rti id="0.0"> 6-facher and higher number per revolution determined. <br>
Critical cyclic testing values for a railway wheel lie over the entire extent measured in the order of magnitude of 0.5 mm as difference of two radii in the same wheel level. <br>
By brake applications with blocking flat places on the bearing surface of the railway wheel can form. These are typically only short, z. B. 50 mm long, but in the comparison to the elongation deeply, D. h. <br>
Flat places exhibit depths between 0.5 mm and more <br><br>
the bearing surface up. In contrast to this the flange on its outer circumference does not wear practically; if necessary with streetcar wheels there is a small wear. It is therefore necessary to supervise the roundness from railway wheels to. <br>
For example a measuring station is for controlling railway vehicle wheels admits become from the DE 693 05 664 T2. The well-known measuring station has two parallel rails; by those everyone one of the railway wheels is assigned and from a set of Messketten is compound, measuring instruments are assigned to which in each case, which sensor exhibits. The well-known measuring station consists of a mechanical subsystem, an electronic subsystem and a compressed air subsystem. The mechanical subsystem is formed by a plate, which mechanisms, which steer potentiometric shift sensors, four or more carries for the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, the flange height, to which flange angles and the distance between wheel arch surfaces correspond per track strand, those. The electronic subsystem consists of potentiometric sensors and processing electronics, whereby the electronic subsystem with a computer is located in connection and contains an electronic processing unit, which contains again signal-processing units. The compressed air system creates an air passage to pneumatic cylinders, which shift the sensors perpendicularly, if a vehicle drives over it. The whole of the individual devices of the well-known measuring station is in a waterproof guard. made of metal accommodated, whereby it becomes possible to operate the measuring station also in the free one. The well-known <br><br>
Measuring station lies in principle in the wheel arch direction, in order to keep three measuring points as possible so long with the railway wheel in contact. With the well-known measuring station, which roundness and also the flat places of railway wheels with the help of a measuring bar, in the quoted patent specification measuring bar (14) calls, are determined. The measuring bar scans the surface of the flange crest relative to the rail and measures as <rti id="0.0"> measured variable Misalignment of the wheel arch surface to the flange crest. It is necessary to arrange the two at the measurement components taken part rail and measuring bar very rigidly in order in this way biased errors, which result from the weight of the vehicle, which affects the railway wheel, to keep as small as possible. This leads well-known-measured to rigid constructions and costly foundations. Beyond that it must be prevented that itself foundation and measuring bar by thermal influences, z. B. shift noticeably to each other by sun exposure, which affects a railroad track in the free one, between two calibration cycles. <br>
Task of the available invention is it to measure the cyclic testing and flat places of a railway wheel in the way that both the influence the up and the influences of temperatures a negligible role play the railway wheel of working weight. <br>
Beyond that the associated measuring instrument is to be simple in its structure and require little expenditure with maintenance. <br>
The task is solved from measuring instrument, which is arranged within a measuring section along the rail of a railroad track and from a majority <br><br>
from individual sensors, those exists in each case a lateral distance from each other has and in the plane of measurement along the axis of rotation of the railway wheel and/or. the wheel set and perpendicularly to the road-contact area of the respective railway wheel are connected with the rail. <br>
The railway wheel runs off with its bearing surface on a course-usual profiled rail. Such rails are z. B. according to the standards UIC 60 or S 54 standardized. By the choice of a straight advance distance before beginning of the measuring section it is reached that itself the railway wheel and/or. the wheel set with its two railway wheels only very few transverse to the rail over the measuring section shifts. <the rti id="0.0"> measuring section amounts to usually between to two revolutions of the railway wheel. Since the bearing surface of the railway wheel well-known-measured a kegliges profile has, a such misalignment became as measuring errors on <the rti id="0.0"> result of measurement affect. <br>
Along the measuring section several sensors are arranged. These are fastened with their basis to the rail, and the flange crest of the railway wheel affecting sensors measures in each case in the plane of measurement of the attachment of the sensor. The sensor measures the flange height thus error free if itself the wheel with its <rti id="0.0"> point of rebellion exactly in the plane of measurement finds, which perpendicularly on the rebellion level of the wheel arch surface on the track stands and runs by the axis of rotation of the railway wheel. The respective road-contact area of a railway wheel on the rail has approximately the size of the diameter of a pea. In levels before and behind the plane of measurement the load of the railway wheel will bend the rail relative to the plane of measurement, so that a measuring error results, for that from the wheel load, rail-rigid <br><br>
and the support conditions of the rail and threshold on the crushed stone is dependent. <br>
First an individual sensor can measure the flange height only one point at the wheel extent. In accordance with the characteristic of the elongation, the oval or Polygon, along the rails within the given measuring section several sensors are arranged. With a measuring section according to the wheel extent and with an expected <rti id="0.0"> ?triangle formation " for the wheel form one will therefore plan at least six sensors. <br>
For the arrangement of the sensors within the measuring section it is important that at least always a sensor must fit measuring at the flange. This is necessary for measuring flat places. According to the largest Messweg and the smallest diameter of the railway wheel which can be measured the mutual distance of two sensors can be determined computationally. If one takes a wheel of 600 mm of route card rice diameters and a measuring range of 30 mm of the sensor, then a mutual distance of the individual sensors of approximately 300 mm results. <br>
Each sensor consists of a measuring lever, which in each case carries a role roll-stored with large accuracy as tracer for affecting the railway wheel on the extent of the flange crest. This role is to reduce wear by relative motions and falsifications of the measured values by frictional forces. The role sits at an end of an exactly led measuring lever, whose axis of rotation carries a Winkelmesssystem of high resolution. The role of the measuring lever is pressed by a return spring to the flange crest. As moved part the mass of the measuring lever and the role becomes as small as possible, <br><br>
the rigidity as largely as possible implemented. Since the Messkraft is to change for if possible little during a measurement, to the RTI <id the force production> /RTI used return spring a soft characteristic have. <br>
The sensor is in the plane of measurement, i.e. where the roller tappet sits, and only here with the rail rigidly connected. In the plane of measurement also a calibration notice intended, which permits it, is to be had, for all sensors a same zero point, independently of the thermal deformation of the respective measuring levers. <br>
The railway wheel will jerky accelerate the role during the first contact of the sensor. It is therefore. free travel intended, in order to calm the sensor down by its natural or additional absorption and friction. <br>
The return spring must apply sufficient Messkraft, in order to overcome smaller impurities of the flange crest. If necessary the measuring section a plant can be upstream for the cleaning of the flange. <br>
Behind the apex of the railway wheel Kraft of the return spring the acceleration of the measuring lever must ensure. Kraft of acceleration can be determined from the inertia of the measuring lever and the roller tappet as well as the wheel diameter and the speed of the railway wheel. <br>
The measuring section of all twelve sensors, for example within the measuring section of a track, with high frequency are seized. The frequency depends on the dissolution, those for the elongation is needed and intends themselves again over diameters and <br><br>
Speed of the railway wheel. Beyond that the frequency must be so high that the shortest flat place with three points can be seized. <br>
As soon as the railway wheel with two or three sensors is affected at the same time and a sensor the flange height determine could, this is in the expiration inevitably the case, can the diameters of the bearing surface and the flange crest of the railway wheel be determined. The result of measurement is falsified by the influence of the load of the railway wheel, therefore one corrects z. B. with a middle load. The accuracy of the computation of the diameter of the railway wheel can be increased still by the fact that one all data's pairs of all sensors (with exception of measuring range, which are falsified by flat places) in the computation considers. One can beyond that introduce the elongation of the railway wheel determined after the measurement again correcting to the computing course and increase so the accuracy of the computation of the diameter. <br>
Further one can both from the signals of an individual sensor with computed final diameter of the bearing surface of the railway wheel or from the temporal distance, which develops, until two adjacent sensors could measure the flange height, the speed of the railway wheel calculates. <br>
With the help of the circle equation and the speed of the railway wheel now the measured values of the sensors can be converted in the way that they result in a continuous cyclic testing. Due to biased errors, for example the wheel set load, and coincidental errors the result is falsified. It is however sufficiently, over from in such a way treated data the signal <br><br>
to recognize the flat place surely and determine their size. A somewhat less exact representation results naturally from <the rti id="0.0"> source signal. </the></id></rti><br>
The measuring signal is then. if the point of rebellion of the railway wheel is in the proximity of the plane of measurement, less falsifies. In this range thus the calculated " continuous cyclic testing " is more exact and can be used at least for the determination of a tangent to the cyclic testing curve of the railway wheel in the plane of measurement. The knowledge of the route card rice diameter of the railway wheel permits it, the measured values, which go beyond a revolution, for a clockface diagram representation, to ?flange elevator difference over angles of rotation <of the rti id="0.0"> Eisbahnrades ", to use. The measuring error, which results from an axial wheel movement transverse to the rail over the Kegelform of the bearing surface of the railway wheel, can be reduced, in which one the measured values of the angle <rti id="0.0"> 0 and briefly forwards and briefly after <rti id="0.0"> 360 lying And thus a correction for the measured values of the sensors lying between them adapts measured values by linear interpolation each other has. <br>
Apart from the constructional execution of the sensor as rocker with axle transverse to the rail in a general manner also different constructional remarks are possible like linear guidance and rail-parallel fulcrums. <br>
There is for specific Messwege of 40 mm when dissolution under 5 <rti id="0.0"> p possible similar or digital measuring instruments usable, like z. B. Encoder, incrementale, linear yardsticks or magnetostrictive procedures, for which it gives numerous manufacturers. <br><br>
In the following the invention with a remark example is more near described. <br>

The Fig. <rti id="0.0"> 1 a railway wheel 1 shows in one instant, where it unreels 2 in the direction 3 on a rail 4 with its bearing surface. In a track, which as well known consists of two to each other parallel and beabstandeten rails 4, the railway wheel 1 is held by the flange 5. With the run by the track the railway wheel 1 turns around its axis of rotation 6, which to the image plane of the Fig. <rti id="0.0"> 1 is perpendicular. In the Fig. <rti id="0.0"> 1 is </rti> for example the elongation 7 of a railway wheel 1 represented. The elongation 7 corresponds to the difference of the flange heights 8 and 9 for example measured in the level of the axis of rotation 6 in the direction of travel 3. In the available example of the Fig. <rti id="0.0"> 1 the road-contact area 10 of the railway wheel 1 is around the amount of the elongation 7 opposite the wheel axle 6 transferred. <br>
For example the road-contact area is 10 as white point within a black framework 11 in the Fig. 2 represented. The black framework 11 illustrates those <br><br>
Size of a flat place in relation to the normal road-contact area 10 of a railway wheel 1 on a rail 4. <br>
The railway wheel 1 the Fig unreeling in the direction of travel 3 on the rail 4. 2 one affects at the flange crest 5 by several sensors 12. Each sensor 12 consists of a measuring lever 13, to whose outside end a measuring role of 14 is fastened in each case. As one in the Fig. 2 to recognize, take the sensors 2 with their roller tappets 14 can do when affecting the flange crest 5 of the railway wheel according to 1 in the direction of travel 3 way different in each case horizontal positions 15 put back. The horizontal positions 15 of the roller tappets 14 correspond to the Messweg. <br>
Each sensor 12 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) consists of a basis 16, which is fastened in the plane of measurement 17 with the rail 4. The plane of measurement 17 corresponds to the level, which on the track 4 perpendicularly to the road-contact area 10 and parallel to the wheel axle 6 runs. With the basis 16 the measuring lever 13 connected by a swivel joint 18 is swivelling. The measuring lever 13 on the basis 16 over a return spring 19 relies off at the same time. In the swivel joint <rti id="0.0"> 18-ist in addition a angle primary detector 20 intended, the respective horizontal position 15 of the measuring role of 14 at the flange crest 5 in the plane of measurement 17 determines. <br>
The Fig. the signal of a sensor 12 shows 5 over the time at different speeds of the railway wheel 1 in the direction of motion 3. <br>
For example the signal 21 corresponds to a slow run of the railway wheel 1 and the curve 22 a fast run of the railway wheel <rti id="0.0"> 1. </rti> The section 24 in <br><br>
the way time diagram of the Fig. corresponds to 5 to the Messweg, to which by the individual sensors 12 when rolling over the flange crest 5 back one puts. <br>
In one the Fig. 5 similar way time diagram that. Fig. 6 is next to each other arranged a majority of measuring curves 23 over a measuring section 25, as they correspond to the signals 26 of the individual sensors 12. As in the Fig. 6 recognizably, the measuring section 25 larger than the wheel extent 27, which a railway wheel 1 puts back with only one revolution, is somewhat. As in the Fig. 6 further recognizably, is in each case long the signals 26 differently. Tangents, to the measuring curves 23 put on, result in an approximately sinusoidal process <rti id="0.0"> 28. This Process 28 corresponds to the measured elongation of the railway wheel 1 over a range of the wheel arch surface 2. In the available case has the envelope 28 in addition still another rise 29. The rise 29 represents the transverse movement of the railway wheel 1 when unreeling on the track toward to the axis of rotation 6. <br>
The measuring signal 30 the Fig. a recessing 31 shows 7. <br>
Recessing 31 is due to a flat place 11, which was determined on the bearing surface 2 of the railway wheel 1. An isolated representation 32 of the flat place 11 regarding their situation and depth on the extent of the bearing surface 2 is then in the Fig. to see 8. <br><br><br>
