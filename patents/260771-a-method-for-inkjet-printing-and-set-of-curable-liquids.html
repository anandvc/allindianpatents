Description<br>
SET OF CURABLE LIQUIDS AND METHODS FOR INKJET PRINTING Technical field<br>
[0001]  The invention relates to a method for Inkjet printing suitable for preparing identification documents secured against alteration and for preparing graphic displays secured against graffiti.<br>
Background art<br>
Identification documents are used on a daily basis to prove identity, to verify age, to access a secure area, to evidence driving privileges, to cash a check, to make payments, to access an automated teller machine(ATM), to debit an account and so on. Airplane passengers are required to show an identification document (hereafter "ID document") during check in, security screening and prior to boarding their flight. Since they play a critical role in today's society, it is essential that ID documents cannot be falsified and are tamperproof.<br>
Identification cards and documents, such as driving licenses, national or government identification cards, bank cards, credit cards, controlled access cards and smart cards, carry certain items of information which relate to the identity of the bearer. Examples of such infomiation or variable data include name, address, birth date, signature and photo of the bearer. The ID cards or documents may in addition cany invariant data, i.e., data common to a large number of cards, for example the name of an employer.<br>
Inkjet printing is very suitable for handling variable data. Also due to the compactness of Inkjet printers, it has become one of the preferred printing techniques for manufacturing ID documents. Inkjet printing can be used to assemble identification cards as disclosed, for example, in US 2005042396 (DIGIMARC) using pigmented Inkjet inks for printing the variable data, but it is also possible to use Inkjet printing to introduce security features. In US 6837959 (AGFA) Inkjet printing is used to manufacture identification cards containing a watermark revealed by partial impregnation of a UV-curable lacquer into a porous opaque ink-receiving layer.<br><br>
Another security measure used in ID documents Is the application of a transparent or translucent layer which is difficult or impossible to remove from the surface of the Image-receiving layer, thereby sealing the data printed on the Image-receiving layer. Such layers can be applied to ID documents using UV-curable liquids as disclosed in EP 0189125 A (INTERLOCK SICHERHEITSSYSTEME) and US 5614289 (KONICA). WO 01/32789 (3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES) discloses a cure-on-demand curable ink composition comprising a homogeneous mixture of at least one of: (a) a compound having 2 reactive silyl groups, and (b) a compound having at least 3 reactive sllyl groups; acid generating catalyst; and pigment or pigment chip. The Inks are improved for curing speed and outdoor weatherabillty, but nothing Is mentioned on their use for preventing falsification of ID documents or graffiti on blllboards, Photocurable inkjet-inks comprising specific oxetane compounds are disclosed by US 2004050292 (KONISHIROKU) and US 2004052967 (KONISHIROKU), however both are silent on methods to prevent falsification of ID documents or graffiti on billboards. EP 1398175 A (AGFA) discloses an Information carrier comprising: a rigid sheet or web support; an opaque porous receiving layer capable of being rendered substantially transparent by penetration by a lacquer, the receiving layer containing a pigment and a binder; an image provided onto and/or In the receiving layer; a cured pattern of a varnish provided onto the receiving layer provided with the Image or onto and/or in the receiving layer provided with the image if the varnish is incapable of rendering the receiving layer transparent; and a cured layer of the lacquer provided on the receiving layer provided with the image and the cured pattern of the varnish, the lacquer having rendered the parts of the receiving layer in contact therewith substantially transparent, wherein the cured pattern of the vamish forms an opaque watermark. The patent is silent on measures to prevent falsification of Information carriers. US 2004024089 discloses coatings, printing inks or paint vanishes provided for herein comprising at least one epoxypolysiloxane that is modified with an oxyalkylene group and contains, attached to a Si atom, at<br><br>
least one group of the formula -R3-O-(CnH(2n-m)R'^mO-)xR5 where the variables and indices are described therein. Methods for improving the slip and release properties or the leveling and wetting properties of a coating are also disclosed, but the application is silent on methods to prevent falsification of ID documents or graffiti on billboards. However the availability of cheap digital printing systems such as inkjet printers also led to a new type of fraudulent action on ID documents. Overprinting and over-labelling of the personalised information, such as the common "photo swap" method, allows easy and fast abuse of a stolen ID-document.<br>
Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture ID documents secured against alteration using a simple manufacturing method and a compact apparatus.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple method for<br>
manufacturing a secure ID document with a compact apparatus.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a set of curable<br>
liquids for preparing ID documents, which are difficult to falsify.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a set of curable<br>
liquids for preparing graffiti-proof graphic displays.<br>
Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has been surprisingly found that a secure ID document was obtained by jetting and curing a thin outermost layer containing an abherent agent on top of a cured layer on the ID document whereby the look and feel of the ID document did not change, but all attempts to add information on the image by writing on it, printing with toner or jetting inkjet inks on the outermost layer failed. The resulting outermost layer exhibited no problems of adhesion to the ID document but instead exhibited abhesive properties to labels being applied to its surface. It was also found that the inkjet printing method using a curable liquid containing an abherent agent could be advantageously used to provide<br><br>
posters and other graphic displays, such as point-of-purchase displays, manufactured with UV curable inkjet printing with a thin protective layer exhibiting a high resistance to graffiti without experiencing a different look and feel. This different look and feel is experienced when a clear fluoropolymer film is adhered onto the Inkjet-printed poster. High resistance to graffiti requires large amounts of fluoropolymer preferably having a high molecular weight, present in the inkjet liquid, which limits the possibilities for inkjet printing where inks and liquids are generally required to have a very low viscosity.<br>
Objects of the present invention have been realized with a method for inkjet printing comprising in order the steps of<br>
a)	providing an ink-receiver having an image thereon;<br>
b)	forming on the ink-receiver a layer of a first curable liquid and curing the layer; and<br>
c)	forming an outermost layer of a second curable liquid only on the cured first curable liquid and at least partially covering the image; characterized in that the second curable liquid contains an abherent agent which is absent in the first curable liquid and wherein at least one of the first and second curable liquids is inkjet printed.<br>
Objects of the present invention have also been realized by the use of a polymerizable abherent agent in a curable liquid to prevent falsification of an ID document and to protect graphic displays against graffiti. Objects of the present invention have also been realized by a set of curable liquids for inkjet printing comprising a first curable liquid and a second curable liquid characterized in that said second curable liquid contains an abherent agent which is absent in said first curable liquid. i  Objects of the present invention have also been realized by use of a polymerizable abherent agent in curable inkjet inks or liquids for protecting a graphic display against graffiti. I   Further advantages and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.<br>

Dyes can only manifest the ideal colour in an appropriate range of pH value. Therefore, the inkjet ink used in the inkjet printing method according to the present invention preferably further comprises a pH adjuster. The colorant may be a fluorescent colorant used to introduce additional security features. Suitable examples of a fluorescent colorant include Tinopal™ grades such as Tinopal™ SFD, Uvitex™ grades such as Uvitex™ NFW and Uvitex™ OB. all available from CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS; Leukophor™ grades from CLARIANT and Blancophor™ grades such as Blancophor™ REU and Blancophor™ BSU from BAYER. The colorant is used in the curable liquids in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the curable liquid. Polymeric dispersants<br>
The curable liquid in the present invention may further contain a polymeric dispersant, in order to obtain a stable dispersion of the pigment(s). Polymeric dispersants usable in this invention are not specifically restricted, but the following resins are preferred: petroleum type resins (e.g., styrene type, acryl type, polyester, polyurethane type, phenol type, butyral type, cellulose type, and rosin); and thermoplastic resins (e.g., vinyl<br><br>
chloride, vinylacetate type). Concrete examples of these resins include acrylate copolymers, styrene-acrylate copolymers, acetalized and incompletely saponified polyvinyl alcohol, and vinylacetate copolymers. Commercial resins are known under the tradenames Solsperse™ 32000 and Solsperse™ 39000 available from AVECIA, EFKA™ 4046 available from EFKA CHEMICALS BV, Disperbyk™ 168 available from BYK CHEMIE GMBH.<br>
Preferably a polymeric dispersant is used, but sometimes non-polymeric dispersants are also suitable. A detailed list of non-polymeric as well as some polymeric dispersants is disclosed by MC CUTCHEON. Functional Materials, North American Edition. Glen Rock,N.J.: Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co., 1990. p.110-129.<br>
Typically dispersants are incorporated at 2.5% to 200%, more preferably at 50% to 150% by weight of the pigment. Initiators<br>
The curable liquids used in the Inkjet printing method according to the present invention preferably also contain an initiator. The initiator typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable liquids may be a Norrish type I Initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator. The thermal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable liquid include tert-Amyl peroxybenzoate. 4,4-Azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,1'-Azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), Benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-Bis(tert-Butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, Bis(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyl)benzene, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, tert-Butyl peracetate, tert-Butyl peroxide, tert-Butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-Butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, Cumene hydroperoxide. Cyclohexanone<br><br>
peroxide, Dicumyl peroxide, LauroyI peroxide, 2,4- Pentanedione peroxide. Peracetic acid and Potassium persulfate. The photo-initiator or photo-initiator system absorbs light and is responsible for the production of initiating species, such as free radicals and cations. Free radicals and cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>
Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
A combination of different types of initiator, for example, a photo-initiator and a thermal initiator can also be used.<br>
A preferred Norrish type l-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzoinethers, benzil ketals, α,α-dialkoxyacetophenones, α-hydroxyalkylphenones, α-aminoalkylphenones, acylphosphine oxides, acylphosphine sulphides, α-haloketones, α-halosulfones and α-halophenylglyoxalates.<br>

Esacure™ KIP150, Esacure™ KT37 and Esacure™ EDB available from LAMBERTI, H-Nu™ 470 and H-Nu™ 470X available from SPECTRA GROUP Ltd..<br>
Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonlum salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
The curable liquids may contain a photo-initiator system containing photo-inltiator(s) and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizers include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, oxazine. coumarin, pyronine. porphyrin, acridine, azo, diazo, cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline, tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes. The amount of the sensitizer is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable liquid. In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable liquids may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime<br><br>
ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable liquid. A preferred initiator system is 2,2*-bis(o-chlorophenyl}-4,4',5,5'-tetraphenyl-(7CI,8CI) 4,4'-Bi-4H-imidazole corresponding to the chemical formula:<br><br><br><br><br>
in the presence of a co-initiator such as 2-mercapto benzoxazole. Another preferred type of initiator is an oxime ester. A suitable example has as chemical formula:<br><br>
A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable liquid, and more preferably 1 -15 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable liquid.<br>
Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing<br>
wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of<br>
photo-initiator together. Inhibitors [0129]  Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants,<br>
hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone<br><br>
monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol. pyrogallol may also be used. Of these, a phenol compound having a double bond in molecules derived from acrylic acid is particularly preferred due to its having a polymerization-restraining effect even when heated in a closed, oxygen-free environment. Suitable inhibitors are. for example, Sumilizer™ GA-80, Sumilizer™ GM and Sumilizer™ GS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. Ciba Irgastab™ UV10 from CIBA Specialty Products and Genorad™ 16 available from RAHN.<br>
Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization be determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is generally between 200 and 20,000 ppm of the total weight of the curable liquid.<br>
Surfactants<br>
[0131]  The curable liquids used in the Inkjet printing method according to the present invention may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity below 20 wt% based on the total curable liquid weight and particularly in a total below 10 wt% based on the total weight of the curable liquid.<br>
Dispersion medium<br>
[0132] The curable liquids contain monomers and/or oligomers as the dispersion medium but may further consist of water and/or organic solvents, such as alcohols, fluorinated solvents and dipolar aprotic solvents.<br>
[0133]   However, the curable liquids preferably do not contain an evaporable component, but sometimes, it can be advantageous to incorporate an extremely small amount of an organic solvent in such inks to improve adhesion to the surface of the ink-receiver after UV curing. In this case, the added solvent can be any amount in the range that does not cause problems of solvent resistance and VOC. and preferably 0.1-5.0 wt%, and particularly preferably 0.1-3.0 wt%. each based on the total weight of the curable liquid.<br><br>
Suitable organic solvents include alcohol, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves. higher fatty add esters. Suitable alcohols include, methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene. Suitable ketones include methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone. 2,4-pentanedione and hexafluoroacetone. Also glycol, glycolethers, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamid, N, N-dimethylformamid may be used.<br>
Biocides<br>
[0135]  Suitable biocides for the curable liquids used in the Inkjet printing method according to the present invention include sodium dehydroacetate, 2-phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, sodium pyridinethion-1-oxide, ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate and 1.2-benzisothia2olin-3-one and salts thereof. A preferred biocide for the curable liquid is Proxel™GXL available from ZENECA COLOURS.<br>
[0136]  A biocide is preferably added in an amount of 0.001 to 3 wt.%, more preferably 0.01 to 1.00 wt. %, each based on the curable liquid.<br>
Other additives<br>
[0137]   In addition to the constituents, described above, the curable liquids may, if necessary, further contain following additives to have desired performance: evaporation accelerators, rust inhibitors, crosslinking agents, soluble electrolytes as conductivity aid, sequestering agents and chelating agents, compounds to introduce additional security features,...<br>
[0138]  Compounds to introduce additional security features include a fluorescent compound, a phosphorescent compound, a thermochromic compound, an iridescent compound and a magnetic particle. Suitable UV-fluorescent and phosphorescent compounds include LUMILUX™ luminescent pigments from HONEYWELL, UVITEX^M OB from CIBA^GEIGY. KEYFLUOR™ dyes and pigments from KEYSTONE and fluorescent dyes from SYNTHEGEN.<br>
Printing means<br>
[0139]  The second curable liquid, and preferably also the first curable liquid, used in the Inkjet printing method according to the present invention may be<br><br>
jetted by one or more printing heads ejecting small droplets of liquid in a controlled manner through nozzles onto an ink-receiver surface, which is moving relative to the printing head(s).<br>
A preferred printing head for the Inkjet printing system according to the present invention is a piezoelectric head. Piezoelectric Inkjet printing is based on the movement of a piezoelectric ceramic transducer when a voltage is applied thereto. The application of a voltage changes the shape of the piezoelectric ceramic transducer in the printing head creating a void, which is then filled with ink. When the voltage is again removed, the ceramic expands to its original shape, ejecting a drop of ink from the print head. However the Inkjet printing method according to the present invention Is not restricted to piezoelectric Inkjet printing. Other InkJet printing heads can be used and include various types, such as a continuous type and thermal, electrostatic and acoustic drop on demand type.<br>
At high printing speeds, the liquids must be ejected readily from the printing heads, which puts a number of constraints on the physical properties of the ink, e.g. a low viscosity at the jetting temperature, which may vary from 25°C to 110°C. a surface energy such that the printing head nozzle can form the necessary small droplets, a homogenous liquid capable of rapid conversion to a dry printed area,... The viscosity of the curable liquid used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention is preferably lower than 30 mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably between 2 and 10 mPas at a shear rate of 100 s-1 and a jetting temperature between 10 and 55°C.<br>
The Inkjet printing head normally scans back and forth in a transversal direction across the moving ink-receiver surface. Often the Inkjet print head does not print on the way back. Bi-directional printing is preferred for obtaining a high area! throughput. Particulariy preferred, is printing in a "single pass printing process", which can be performed by using page wide Inkjet printing heads or multiple staggered Inkjet printing heads which cover the entire width of the ink-receiver surface. In a single pass printing<br><br>
process the Inkjet printing heads usually remain stationary and the ink-receiver surface is transported under the Inkjet printing heads. Curing means<br>
The curable liquids can be cured by exposing them to actinic radiation, by thermal curing and/or by electron beam curing. A preferred means of radiation curing is ultraviolet radiation. Preferably the curing is performed by an overall exposure to actinic radiation, by overall thermal curing and/or by overall electron beam curing.<br>
The curing means may be arranged in combination with the print head of the Inkjet printer, travelling therewith so that the curable liquid is exposed to curing radiation very shortly after been jetted. In such an arrangement it can be difficult to provide a small enough radiation source connected to and travelling with the print head. Therefore, a static fixed radiation source may be employed, e.g. a source of curing UV radiation, connected to the radiation source by means of flexible radiation conductive means such as a fibre optic bundle or an internally reflective flexible tube.<br>
Alternatively, the actinic radiation may be supplied from a fixed source to the radiation head by an arrangement of mirrors including a mirror upon the radiation head.<br>
The source of radiation arranged not to move with the print head, may also be an elongated radiation source extending transversely across the ink-receiver surface to be cured and adjacent the transverse path of the print head so that the subsequent rows of images formed by the print head are passed, stepwise or continually, beneath that radiation source. Any ultraviolet light source, as long as part of the emitted light can be absorbed by the photo-initiator or photo-initiator system, may be employed as a radiation source, such as, a high or low pressure mercury lamp, a cold cathode tube, a black light, an ultraviolet LED, an ultraviolet laser, and a flash light. Of these, the preferred source is one exhibiting a relatively long wavelength UV-contribution having a dominant wavelength of 300-400 nm. Specifically, a UV-A light source is preferred due to the reduced light scattering therewith resulting in more efficient interior curing.<br><br>
UV radiation is generally classed as UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C as follows:<br>
•	UV-A: 400 nm to 320 nm<br>
•	UV-B: 320 nm to 290 nm<br>
•	UV-C: 290 nm to 100 nm.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to cure the image using, consecutively or simultaneously, two light sources of differing wavelength or illuminance. For example, the first UV source can be selected to be rich in UV-C, in particular in the range of 260 nm-200 nm. The second UV source can then be rich in UV-A, e.g. a gallium-doped lamp, or a different lamp high in both UV-A and UV-B. The use of two UV sources has been found to have advantages e.g. a fast curing speed.<br>
For facilitating curing, the Inkjet printer often includes one or more oxygen depletion units. The oxygen depletion units place a blanket of nitrogen or other relatively inert gas (e.g.CO2). with adjustable position and adjustable inert gas concentration, in order to reduce the oxygen concentration in the curing environment. Residual oxygen levels are usually maintained as low as 200 ppm, but are generally in the range of 200 ppm to 1200 ppm. Thermal curing can be performed image-wise by use of a thermal head, a heat stylus, hot stamping, a laser beam, etc. If a laser beam is used, then preferably an infrared laser is used in combination with an infrared dye in the curable liquid.<br>

Monti label art.167155 is a "Laser, Inkjet and copier A4-laber art.167155<br>
from MONTI NV, Belgium. Measurement methods 1. Adhesion [0155]  The adhesion of a layer to the other layer or to the support was tested by<br>
pressing a 5 cm piece of Scotch Maaic™Tape 810 from 3M onto the<br><br>
sample and pulling it off with moderate force. The test result was evaluated as:<br>
-	OK	: if no parts of the sample came off with the tape;<br>
-	Not OK     : if parts of the sample came off with the tape. [0156]  A good adhesion of all layers on the support is required,<br>
2.	Writing &amp; erasability test<br>
[0157]  This test checks if a sample can be falsified using a number of different<br>
pens for writing on the sample. The pens used are:<br>
Pen 1 : Guilbert™ Guilmarker 90<br>
Pen 2 : Corporate Express™ Chisel Tip Highlighter<br>
Pen 3 : Pentel™ Maxiflo White Board Marker<br>
Pen 4 : Stabilo™ OHPen Universal Permanent F Blue. [0158]  An evaluation was made in accordance with the criterion described below.<br>
Criterion:<br>
1.	immediate and very strong repelling of the ink is observed on writing and the written information can be very easily wiped away;<br>
2.	almost immediate and strong repelling of the ink is observed on writing and the written information can be easily wiped away;<br>
3.	almost immediate and strong repelling of the ink is observed on writing and the written information can be wiped away but not so easily as in criterion 2;<br>
4.	weak repelling of the ink is observed on writing but the written information can be wiped away;<br>
5.	weak repelling of the ink is observed on writing and the written information is difficult to wipe away;<br>
6.	no or almost no repelling of the ink is observed on writing and the written information can hardly or not be wiped away.<br>
[0159]   It is considered that falsification of an ID card is possible with a criterion evaluated to be 4, 5 or 6, while If the criterion is evaluated to be 1, 2 or 3 falsification is prevented.<br>
3.	Print test<br>
[0160]  An :Agorix UV curable magenta Inkjet ink from AGFA was jetted according to an image containing a logo and text by a custom built ink-jet printer<br><br>
equipped with a :UPH print head from AGFA. A resolution of 360x360dpi was used to print at 4 dpd (droplets per dot), wherein 1 dpd is equal to a droplet volume of 3 pL. An evaluation was made in accordance with the criterion described below. Criterion:<br>
= no imaging possible on the sample +        = imaging on the sample To prevent falsification of an ID document, no imaging by an Inkjet printer should be possible. When no imaging was possible, i.e. a non-homogenous spreading of droplets and uncontrollable formation of large and small droplets), after curing the "falling apart" image could be easily removed from the ink-receiver.<br>
4. Label test<br>
[0163]  A Monti label art.167155 was applied to the sample. An evaluation was made in accordance with the criterion described below. Criterion:<br>
= label can easily be peeled off; +      = label sticks well to the sample and is difficult to remove.<br>
[0164]  Over-labelling of the personalised information, e.g. the photo of a person, in an ID document should not be possible. If a label does not adhere to an ID document due to its abhesive properties, it is immediately observed by the authority instructed to check the ID document.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0165] This example illustrates that writing and over-labelling of ID cards can be prevented by using an abherent agent in the outermost layer of a second curable liquid on a layer of first curable liquid.<br>
[0166]  Three comparative samples COMP-1 to COMP-3 and an inventive sample INV-1 were prepared according to Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Preparation of the comparative sample COMP-1<br>
[0167]   First a dispersion A was prepared by mixing the ingredients according to<br><br>
[0168]  This dispersion A was then used to prepare an ink-receiver composition according to Table 3.<br><br>
[0169] The thus prepared ink-receiver composition was coated onto the<br>
transparent subbed support AGFA PET at a coverage of 100 g/m2 and dried on air.<br>
[0170]  After drying the ink receiving layer was printed by means of an EPSON<br>
PHOTO STYLUS™ R800 Inkjet printer with multiple sets of digitally stored personal Information to deliver the comparative sample COMP-1.<br>
Preparation of the comparative sample COMP-2<br><br>
The comparative sample COMP-1 was overcoated with a first curable liquid LIQ-1 lacking an abherent agent and having a composition according to Table 4 .<br><br>
The first curable liquid LIQ-1 was coated on the comparative sample COMP-1 using a BRAIVE barcoater with a 50 µm wired bar. The ink-receiver became totally transparent after penetration of the first curable liquid into the ink-receiver. The coated layer was cured using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bu!b 240 W/cm), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 33.5 cm/s to deliver comparative sample COMP-2. To obtain a complete curing two passes were necessary.<br>
Preparation of the inventive sample INV*1<br>
[0173]  In the printed circuit industry, photographic masks bearing a circuit pattern are known as phototools. The company 3M has developed a coating solution, SCOTCHGARD™ Phototool Protector, to deal with scratching and abrasion, which is a serious problem for phototools. We have found that this solvent-free, low-viscosity solution contains the polymerizable abherent agent gamma-glycidoxypropy! trimethoxysilane and that it was possible to jet this solution. The solution had a viscosity at 25oC of 11.4 mPa.s and a surface tension of 23,6 mN/m.<br>
[0174] The SCOTCHGARDTM Phototool Protector solution was jetted on the<br>
comparative sample COMP-2 with a custom built ink-jet printer equipped with an :UPH print head from AGFA, A resolution of 360x360dpi was used to print at 8 dpd (droplets per dot), wherein 1 dpd is equal to a droplet volume of 3 µL.<br><br>
The jetted sample was cured using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bulb 240 W/cm), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 33.5 cm/s to deliver the inventive sample INV-1.<br>
Preparation of the comparative sample COMP-3<br>
[0176]   The SCOTCHGARD™ Phototool Protector solution was also jetted on the comparative sample COMP-1 with the custom built ink-jet printer equipped with a :UPH print head from AGFA. A resolution of 360x360dpi was used to print at 8 dpd .<br>
[0177]  The jetted sample was cured using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bulb 240 W/cm), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 33.5 cm/s to deliver the comparative sample COMP-3.<br>
Results and Evaluation<br>
[0178] The comparative samples COMP-1 to COMP-3 and the inventive sample INV-1 were tested on their adhesion and their possibilities of falsification. The results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
[0179] From Table 5 it should be clear that a first curable liquid was necessary before jetting the second curable liquid containing the abherent agent to obtain a tamperproof ID document. In comparative sample COMP-3 the first curable liquid was omitted and it was observed that the coated ink-receiver layer of COMP-1 not only became opaque but also did not longer adhere to the support on application of the curable liquid containing the abherent agent. Hence it was difficult to evaluate over-labelling.<br><br>
It can also be seen in Table 5 that, besides writing or over-labelling, printing of a radiation curable Inkjet ink on the inventive sample INV-1 was not possible in order to provide a new layer containing falsified information on top of the outermost layer.<br>
The same results were obtained with an EPSON PHOTO STYLUSTM R300 ink jet printer using dye based Inkjet inks instead of an EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R800 Inkjet printer using pigmented Inkjet inks.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0182]  This example illustrates which amount of abherent agent in the second<br>
curable liquid for forming the outermost layer is required in order to obtain secure ID documents,<br>
[0183]  The SCOTCHGARD™ Phototool Protector solution contains about 60 wt% of gamma-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane as abherent agent, no colorants and triphenylsulfonium hexafluoro-antimonate as cationic photoinitiator. The SCOTCHGARD™ Phototool Protector solution was diluted by adding the monofunctional Actilane™ 411 monomer according to Table 6 and used to prepare the inventive samples INV-2 to INV-4 and comparative sample COMP-4 in the same manner as inventive sample INV-1 was prepared in EXAMPLE 1.<br><br>
Results and Evaluation<br>
[0184]  The comparative samples COMP-2 and COMP-4 and the inventive<br>
samples lNV-1 to INV-4 were tested in the same way as in EXAMPLE 1 on their adhesion and their possibilities of falsification. The results are shown in Table 7,<br><br><br>
[0185] From Table 7 it should be clear that the second curable liquids containing 24 wt% or more of the abherent agent delivered samples secured against falsification.<br>
[0186] The same results were obtained with an EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R300 Inkjet printer using dye based inkjet inks instead of an EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R800 Inkjet printer using pigmented Inkjet inks.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
