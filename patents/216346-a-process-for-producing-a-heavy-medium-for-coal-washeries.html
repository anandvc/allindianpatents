				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for producing heavy medium for coal<br>
washeries, using millscale and blast furnace flue dust mixture generated in<br>
integrated steel plants.<br>
It is known that the coarse fraction of non oily millscale, generally called<br>
millscale (about +1 mm and having oil content 2%) is presently being used in<br>
sinter plants and blast furnaces.<br>
The flue dust (rich in alkali) is now discarded as waste.<br>
In the manufacture of blast furnace coke from coal, the coal is subjected to<br>
washing for lowering the ash content so that the high ash Indian coal can be<br>
usefully employed in coke manufacture. The ash content is to be lowered to a<br>
practical limit of 17-18% which is dictated by the quality of Indian coking coals.<br>
The general practice of coal washing is to crush the coal to below 50 mm or<br>
less, followed by separate treatment of coarse (+0.5mm) and fine (-0.5 mm)<br>
coal fractions. While fine coal is processed by froth flotation, coarse coal cleaning<br>
is universally carried out by heavy medium separation. In commercial plants of<br>
heavy medium separation using dense medium cyclones, finely divided solids of<br>
magnetite are kept in suspension in water to create a dense medium.<br>
Thus for the creation of the heavy medium in the above mentioned coal washing<br>
procedure, magnetite is being employed.<br>
In India, the reserves of magnetite material are meagre and therefore an<br>
alternative source of heavy medium for use in coal washeries has assumed<br>
importance.<br>
It is already known to use secondary magnetite obtained as a by-product in the<br>
plants for uranium ore extraction, as heavy medium in coal washeries. However,<br>
the qualities, properties and the cost of secondary magnetite now vary<br>
considerably and therefore, a uniform variety of secondary magnetite has<br>
become essential.<br>
Moreover, since the coal industry in India is ever expanding, the demand for<br>
secondary magnetite has assumed huge proportions.<br>
If the magnetite requirements of the coal washeries can be shifted from the<br>
mineral magnetite to other secondary sources of substantially similar qualities,<br>
not only a great saving of the magnetite can be ensured for other more<br>
important and useful purposes, but also a secondary source can be beneficially<br>
developed.<br>
It is therefore, an object of this invention to propose a process for the utilization<br>
of millscale + flue dust mixture as heavy medium in coal washeries.<br>
It is another abject of this invention to propose such a<br>
process which will produce substantially uniform quality of a<br>
material alternative to magnetite.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a<br>
process which will be economical and can be practised without<br>
difficulty.<br>
A stil further object of the present invention is to propose<br>
such a process by which the degree of pollution contributed by<br>
millscale and blast furnace flue dust can be controlled or<br>
removed due to its usage as heavy medium in coal washing plants.<br>
Thus according to this invention, there is provided a<br>
process for producing a heavy medium for coal washeries, using<br>
millscale and blast furnace flue dust mixture generated in<br>
integrated steel plants, comprising the steps of screening the<br>
millscale for its size; grinding the millscale to have a size of<br>
less than 0.044 mm; subjecting the blast furnace flue dust to<br>
magnetic separation to generate a magnetic fraction of desired<br>
specific gravity; mixing the magnetic fraction of said flue dust<br>
with said ground millscale to make a homogenous mixture of<br>
desired specific gravity; grinding the mixture to have at least<br>
90% in size of less than 0.049 mm; and adding required amount of<br>
water to the ground mixture for making a heavy medium of the<br>
desired specific gravity of suspension, for use in coal<br>
washeries.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the<br>
same will be apparent from the following description.<br>
The mill scale + flue dust contains magnetic property and hence compares<br>
closely with magnetite, which is generally mined and used as heavy medium in<br>
coal washeries.<br>
The description that follows also show that the properties of mill scale + flue<br>
dust compare favourably with those of magnetite.<br>
It will be seen that the properties of mill scale + flue dust and magnetite are<br>
almost identical, but for minor differences.<br>
It has been found that the mill scale + flue dust can be gainfully employed as<br>
heavy medium in conventional coal washing industries.<br>
The process of manufacture of blast furnace coke from coal has been discussed<br>
in detail in pages 2 and 3.<br>
Table 1 shows a comparison between the millscale + flue dust and magnetite<br>
which indicates size is 90% below 0.045 mm compared to 80% below for<br>
magnetite. Stability and recoverability is also better in case of millscale + flue<br>
dust.<br>
Table 2 compares results of the dense media cyclone tests which indicates a<br>
better clean coal yield in case of millscale + flue dust used as heavy medium.<br>
The process steps will now be described in detail.<br>
The coarse and non oily millscale generated in the steel<br>
plant is screened and particles of size bigger than 0.044mm are<br>
ground to reduce to sizes below 0.044 mm.<br>
The blast furnace flue dust from the steel plant is then<br>
subjected to dry magnetic separation to get a magnetic product.<br>
The magnetic separation is carried out at 7000 gauss to generate<br>
a magnetic fraction of specific gravity 3.<br>
The magnetic product thus obtained from bast furnace flue dust<br>
is then mixed homogenously with the ground millscale, at least<br>
90% of the latter being of size less than 0.044 mm.<br>
The mixing can be carried out in the ratio of 47 parts of<br>
magnetic product to 53 parts of ground millscale for obtaining a<br>
product specific gravity not less than 4.5. The mixture is then<br>
ground to get a product with more than 90% passing through<br>
0.045 mm. Desired amount of water is then added to this mixture<br>
for making the desired specific gravity of suspension.<br>
This material can then be used as heavy medium in coal<br>
washeries. The recoverability is 85% at 7000 gauss. The<br>
percentage of clean coal yield is 4.81 to 26.33 depending on<br>
clean coal ash percentage of 5.74 to 13.58 as shown in Table - 2.<br>
The invention herein described should be considered am<br>
illustrative and not as restrictive. It is to be appreciated that<br>
those skilled in the art can make changes or modifications<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
