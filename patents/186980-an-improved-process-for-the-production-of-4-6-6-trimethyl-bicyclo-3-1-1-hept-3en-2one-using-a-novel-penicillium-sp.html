				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of the 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo (3.1.1) hept-3en-2one using a novel Penicillium sp. More particularly the present invention relates to a process for production of 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo (3.1.1) hept - 3en - 2one having formula 1 as shown in accompanying drawing by biotransformation using a novel Penicillium  sp.<br>
Production of food flavours employing microbi<br>
al	processes is attractive from the view point of<br>
process economy in the utilisation of inexpensive and<br>
readily available precursor compounds. These are valued<br>
as flavour chemicals and are utilised as food additives.<br>
The conversion assumes commercial importance because the<br>
starting materials are low-cost and yield value added<br>
products.<br>
The production of 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo [3.1.1]hept 3-en-2one (fig 1), which is the subject of present study comes from the oil of verbena, dill, spearmint and eucalyptus oil (Guenther.E., The Essential Oils, (1952) vol 2.444. Fritzche Brothers, Inc. New York, Publisher: D.Van Nostrand Company Inc. It is commonly known as verbenone with structural formula as shown  in  the   drawing  accompanying  this   specification.<br>
Leaves,    the   natural   source,    are   mainly   sold   for<br>
the herb and drug trade, and small quantities are used for distillation of the essential oil. The distillation process gives a very small yield of the oil generally varying from 0.072% to 0.19% oil. By the present method it can be produced at economical price and would be a valuable adjunct to food and can be used to great advantage in certain types of flavours. The current market price of 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo [3.1.1] hept-3en-2one is about Rs.80,000 per kg. It can be formed through microbial source, via hydrogenated bicyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon as shown by Ramadevi, J. and Bhattacharyya. P.K. (1978). Molecular rearrangements in the microbiological transformations of terpenes and chemical logic of microbial process. J. Ind. Chem. Soc, Vol.IV, 1131-1137. The monoterpene alpha-pinene is a by product in lime peel oil, is mainly a waste product from food processing industries. It is also available from turpentine oil as a by product. The utilisation of the low cost substrate to 4,6,6, trimethyi bicycio [3.1.1] hept-3en-2one, a nign value and high priced flavour compound is utilised by a bakeries, confectionary, ice cream and soft drink industry. The compound itself does not have any nutritional value, however, it increases the flavour of the food items.<br>
Recently, this subject has received a lot of attention. Although work is being done abroad on similar lines of biotransformation (Nakayama. H, 1978;    Cadwallader,   1989;     Cheetham,    1995)    Nakayama. H, Yamaguchi. Y,<br>
Machida,    Iwasaki.S,   Komtsu.A  and  Shinoda.A     D-L-Menthol<br>
(1978)	Japan.        Kokai        Source:        CA ,  8 9 ,  7 4217K.<br>
Cadwallader.K.R, Braddock.R.J, Parish.M.E and Higgins.D.P Bioconversion of (+) limonene by Pseudomo-nas gladioli, (1989) Journal of Food Science vol 54 1241-45. Cheetham Peter.S.J. Biotransformations; New Routes to food ingredients. (1995) Chemistry and Industry 3 April. There is no patent or process developed for biotransformation of this particular compound using Penicillium     sp.<br>
There is no work of similar kind being carried out. Therefore, there is an urgent need to have this type of a process which will help in the utilisation of monoterpene hydrocarbon alpha pinene, a by propduct from  the  waste  of   the   food  industries.<br>
A few (four) patents exist on the production of<br>
verbenol, 4,6,6-trimethyl bicyclo [3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-ol<br>
utilising yeast and bacterial cultures. The patent<br>
(No. Int. Pat. Class: C07c-035/28;C 12N-001/26:C12P-<br>
007/02.) by Repph et al show the microbial oxidation<br>
from	sugar	acids	to	4,  6, 6 -trimethy1<br>
bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-ol verbenol, but not to<br>
bicyclo- [3.1.1] hept-3en-2-one , verbenone utilising<br>
Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus<br>
and   Penicillium.	In   his   patent,    Repph      et   al.    has<br>
mentioned   the   formation   of   4,6,6,    trimethyl      bicyclo<br>
[3.1.1] hept-3en-2-one along with major component 4,6,6- trimethyl bicyclo [3.1.1] hept- 2-en-2-ol utilising  methylotrophi  Hansenula  polvmorpha   strain.<br>
There is no patent till date for the production of 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo- [3.1.1] hept- 3-en-2one from bicyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon utilizing Penicillium  Sp.<br>
The main objective of the invention is to produce verbenone a value flavour compound which has wide usage in food industries and used as a food flavour additive starting from alpha pinene a by product from lime peel oil   which  is   a  waste   from  food   industries.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to produce  verbenone  using  a  novel   strain  of   Penicillium.<br>
Another object is to attain high yeild . Still another object is to supplement the nutrient medium with   special   components     to  obtain  a   high  yield.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the production of 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo (3.1.1) hept 3-en-2-one using novel Penicillium sp. which comprises growing a novel strain of   Penicillium   sp.    having   characteristics   as   here   in<br>
described in a potato dextrose broth medium supplemented<br>
with six carbon sugar, assimilable phosphate yeast<br>
extract and alpha pinene at temperature ranging 25-<br>
30°C   for   6h	and   recovering   the   4,6,6,    trimethyl<br>
bicyclo (3.1.1) hept 3- en-2-one by known methods such as  here   in  described.<br>
In the persent investigation the compound 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo (3.1.1) hept -3-en-2-one has been produced starting from bicyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon. The production for the maximum yield has been optimised and media composition has also been varied to obtain the desired results. Concentrations of carbon, yeast extract and phosphorus were shown to affect the yield to a large extent. Microbial transformation specially for the production of food flavours is a recent technique. Earlier some workers have tried biotransformation studies using the substrate alpha pinene as sole source of carbon but in the present study the substrate was varied over a range and it was found that after certain limit the substrate is toxic to the cells and therefore it has been selected by its capacity for the conversion under appropriate growth conditions. The organism was isolated from the soil collected from different areas. The organism isolated from the soil under the lime tree had a higher potency i.e. capacity for bioconversion, therefore, the organism  were   selected   and   isolated   from   the   soil   under   the<br>
lime  tree  where  expectedly  the  microorganisms  had  adapted  themselves   to  grow     on  monoterpene  hydrocarbons.<br>
The underlining principle in the present invention is the use of Surface Response Method for obtaining the maximum conversion yield of 15-2 0%. In the present invention it has been possible to reduce the time of conversion (6 h) , where -as earlier studies indicate a much as 40 to 44 hours. Ramadevi.J and Bhattacharyya.P.K Microbiological transformations of terpenes: part XXIII fermentation of geraniol, nerol and limonene by a soil pseudomonad, Pseudomonas incognita (linalool strain) Ind. J. Biochem. and Biophys. 14, 1977, 288-91. Similarly the yield of the flavouring compounds reported in the patents on conversion of bicyclic monoterpene hydrocarbn to bicyclo- [3.1.1] hept-3-en-2-one has been (10%) reported in the patents on the conversion of bicyclo monoteropene hydrocarbon only by an yeast isolate, Hansenula Repph.H.D Stottme-ist.V ,Duresch.R, Richter.H.P, Schmidt.J, Dorr.M, Hanfe.G,   Weber.L   (1988)      Int.   patent.<br>
At present there is no process available as mentioned here. It is, therefore, felt that the present data is of great importance or advantage for the food industries.<br>
The novelty of the invention lies in use of Peni-cillium sp. for biotransformation of alpha pinene to 4,6,6, trimethyl bicylo (3.1.1) hept 3en-2one and maxi mising the yield much more than which is produced by the plant sources or by any other natural source being used  in  hither  to  known  processes.<br>
Today, there is a lot of awareness especially for food additives like the use of natural flavours and colorants as, more and more people are going in for natural flavours. To produce flavours through microbial   source   is  also  natural  process.<br>
The invention is related to a use of novel strain of organism being used to produce a product,by a bio-technological process. The culture has been deposited in CFTRI culture collection centre, and designated as CFR   201203   dated   10-4-96.<br>
For   the  bioconversion,    the   culture     was   isolated from   the   soil.      This   was   subsequently   serially   diluted and  plated   on  potato   dextrose   agar  medium.      The   plates were   incubated   at   25°   to   35°C   for   a   period   of    3-10 days.   The   spores   were   taken   for   the   experiment.<br>
The   isolated   strain   of   penicillium   sp   has   the following   characteristics   the   spores   are   greyish   in colour,   grows   well   on  potato   dextrose   agar   at   3 0°C   the<br>
spores   have      circular   margins.    The   pigment   produced slightly  diffuses   into  the   agar  medium.<br>
Hence   the  present   invention  provides   a   biotechno-logical   process   mediated   by   a   selected   strain   of   Peni-cillium   for   the   production   of   4,6,6,    trimethyl      bicy-clo- [3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-   one,    generally   described   as below:<br>
A  process   for   the   production   of   4,6,6,    trimethyl bicyclo-    [3.1.1]hept-3-en-2one   was   obtained   by   modifying  the  medium  and  supplementing   it  with  additional   six carbon  sugar,   phosphate  and  yeast   extract.<br>
The  process   comprises  of   the   following  steps.<br>
1.	The   culture   is   maintained   on   Potato   dextrose   agar<br>
at   30°C<br>
2.	Greyish   spores   were   taken   in  potato   dextrose   broth<br>
at   3 0°C  and  grown   for   16.5   h.<br>
3. The grown cells were incubated with substarate alpha pinene for 6 h at 120 rpm at 30°C in phosphate buffer at pH   7.0.<br>
4 .    The   product   was    extracted   in   dichloromethane    and<br>
analyzed  on  GC.<br>
The   invention   is   further   illustrated   by   the following   examples,    which   should   not   be   construed   to limit   the   scope  of     the   invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
The spore suspension was taken in potato dextrose broth with an initial cell density 3.0 O.D on spectrophotometer. This was incubated at 30°C, 120 rpm and taken in buffer at pH 7.0 With addition of substrate alpha pinene. The percent yield conversion was 3.2% or 640 ug/ 100ml to the desired product. The product was confirmed on gas chromatography along with the standard and also by gas chromatography mass spectrophotometer fragmentation pattern. GC analysis was done on a Shimadzu Gas chromatograph equipped with a stainless steel SE-30 column and FID detector. For GCMS (gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry) data, gas Chromatograph mass spectrophotometer Hewlett-Packard 5995 was used with an HP-20 M (carbowax 20M) column (25m x0.32mm) temperature programme at 60°C (6)-4°C/min to 250°C, C15°C, the gas flow rate: lml/min). 4,6,6, trimethyl bicyclo [3.1.1]hept 3-en-2one content was calculated on the area obtained on gas chromatograph of the samples against the area of the standard compound and   characterised  by  GCMS   fragmentation  pattern.<br>
Example-2<br>
The spore suspension with initial cell density of 3.0 O.D was taken in potato dextrose medium supplemented with glucose 7% and after incubation at 30°C was taken up in buffer at pH 7.0 with the substrate. The percent yield conversion increased with such cells to 3.36% or 672 ug/100 ml. The increase in glucose concentration   supports   the   product   formation.<br>
Example-3<br>
The above spore suspension with additional glucose<br>
in the broth was also supplemented with additional<br>
inorganic phosphate KH2P04(500mg/l) and yeast extract<br>
250mg/l.The cell pellet was taken up in phosphate<br>
buffer with pH 7.0 incubated with substrate alpha<br>
pinene   for   6   h.	This      resulted   in   increasing   the<br>
yield   conversion   from   15    to   20%    (3000 -4000ug/ 100ml)  . Additional   glucose,    KH2P04   and      also   yeast   extract enhanced   the   production   of    4,6,6,    trimethyl   bicyclo (3.1.1)    hept   3-en-   2-one   .<br>
