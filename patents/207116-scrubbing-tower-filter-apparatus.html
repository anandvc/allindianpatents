Background of Invention<br>
This invention relates to filter apparatus and in particular, though not exclusively, to filtering apparatus for use in separating fine mist particles from a gas. The invention further relates to a method of operating such a filtering apparatus.<br>
The invention is particularly concerned with the construction and use of filters of elongate tubular configuration which are normally disposed upright when in use (hereinafter referred to as being "of the type stated"). Typical of such filters is a so-called "fibre filter" or "candle filter" consisting of a fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between two concentric mesh or open-work cylinders. Gas(es) pass along the cylinders either up or down and either from inside to outside. The gas(es) pass through the filter bed while the liquid particles coalesce, impact, become intercepted or collected by Brownian Diffusion or a combination of these within the filter bed and drain downwards therethrough.<br>
A problem experienced with such filters arises in certain circumstances from a tendency to flood or over-saturate particularly in the vicinity of a lower end of the filter, causing a reduction in filter performance and/or promoting corrosion of metal components in the said vicinity.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
 2<br>
construction of filter of the type atatcd and also to provide a method of operation therefor, in which the aforementioned problem is obviated or mitigated.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a filter apparatus for separating mist or liquid particles from a gas, comprising at least first and second fibrous filter beds packed into an annular space between first and second substantially concentric mesh or open-work tubular structures, at least one substantially annular member being provided between each adjacent fibrous filter bed.<br>
Advantageously the filter apparatus is disposed in a substantially vertical orientation in use.<br>
In such orientation the first and second fibrous filter beds may comprise upper and lower fibrous filter beds, respectively.<br>
Each fibrous filter bod may be substantially cylindrical.<br>
In some cases one of or each fibrous filter bed may comprise at least two substantially concentrically arranged filter beds, wherein, in use, gas or air is caused to pass through the concentrically arranged beds in series or to pass through at least one of the concentrically arranged beds. In such an arrangement an annular member may be provided at one end of at least one or preferably each<br>
concentric bed.   Alternatively, a single annular member<br>
 3<br>
may be provided at adj acent ends of adj acent concentric beds.<br>
In one embodiment the first and second concentric mesh or open-work tubular structures each comprise a single tubular member.<br>
In the one embodiment the filtering apparatus comprises a single filter body including at least two filter portions.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the first and second concentric mesh or open-work tubular structures each comprise at least first and second tubular members disposed end to end.<br>
In the alternative embodiment the filtering apparatus comprises at least two filter portions suitably connected to provide a single filter body.<br>
In the one embodiment the/each annular member may comprise a ring.<br>
The/each ring may be made from any suitable material resistant to corrosion by the mist or liquid particles or by the gas. For example, the ring may be fabricated from stainless steel or from any suitable synthetic material such as PTFE or polypropylene.<br>
In the alternative embodiment of two adjacent ends of two adjacent filter portions, at least one end is provided with an end closure, the end closure providing the annular member.<br>
The filter apparatus may be adapted to hang substantially vertically from a structural member.<br>
 4<br>
Alternatively, the filter apparatus may be adapted to stand substantially vertically upon a structural member.<br>
The tubular structures may each comprise a cylinder.<br>
The filter apparatus may include a gas input end and a gas output end, the gas output end possibly including a closure plate thereacross so as to close an inside of the tubular structure.<br>
It will be appreciated that the gas may be caused to pass from an inside to an outside of the filter apparatus or alternatively from an outside to an inside of the filter apparatus.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the gas may be caused to pass either down or up the filter apparatus.<br>
In cases where the gas is caused to pass up or down the filter apparatus from the outside, a gutter may be provided in the inside of the tubular structure adjacent each annular member.<br>
In cases where the gas is caused to pass up or down the filter apparatus from the inside, a gutter may be provided on the outside of the tubular structure adjacent each annular member.<br>
Each gutter may be vertically offset downwardly from the respective annular member.<br>
The filter apparatus of the present invention may be adapted for use in, for example, a scrubbing tower of a copper smelter, an ammonium nitrate plant, a sulphuric acid plant, or a hydrofluoric acid plant, or the like.<br>
It will be appreciated that for ease of assembly of<br>
 5<br>
the filter apparatus, each annular member may be glued to at least one adjacent fibrous filter bed provided that such glue is substantially resistant to the mist or liquid particles and to the gas.<br>
Alternatively, each annular member may comprise a hardened end of a fibrous filter bed. The end may be hardened, for example, by predipping the end in a molten polymer.<br>
Accordingly, to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a chemical/material processing plant including a filter apparatus according to the first aspect.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of separating mist or liquid particles from a gas comprising the steps of :<br>
providing a filter apparatus according to the first<br>
aspect;<br>
causing the gas including the mist or liquid particles<br>
to paaa through the filter apparatus either from<br>
inside to outside or outside to inside, such that the<br>
mist or liquid particles are caused to be captured by<br>
one of the filter beds.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for use in separating mist particles from a gas, comprising a first fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between first concentric mesh or open-work cylinders, a second fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between second concentric mesh or<br>
 6<br>
open-work cylinders, end structure means providing end closure of the respective annular spaces, and guide means associated with said end structure means for guiding liquid so that, in use, with the first and second filter beds disposed upright and end-to-end the guide means receives liquid draining from the upper filter bed and dischargee it downwards clear of the lower filter bed.<br>
Further acoording to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for use in separating mist particles from a gas, comprising an upper fibrous filter bed packed<br>
into an annular space between first concentric mesh or open-work cylinders, a lower fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between second concentric mesh or open-work cylinders, the upper and lower filter beds having substantially the same nominal diameter and being disposed upright and end-to-end end structure means providing end closure of the respective annular spaces, and guide meana associated with said end structure means for guiding liquid so that, in use, the guide means receives liquid draining from the upper filter bed and discharges it downwards clear<br>
of the lower filter bed.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, there is<br>
provided    apparatus for use in separating    misr parricdes<br>
from a gas, comprising an upper fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between first concentric mesh or open-work cylinders, a lower fibrous filter bed packed into an annular space between second concentric mesh or open-work cylinders, the upper and lower filter beds having<br>
 7<br>
substantially the same nominal diameter and being disposed upright and and-to-and, and structure means providing, and closure of the respective annular spaces, and guide means associated with said end structure means for guiding liquid so that, in use, the guide means receives liquid draining<br>
of the lower filter bed.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of operating a filter of elongate tubular configuration disposed with its longitudinal axis upright, comprising the steps of;<br>
causing a gas laden with particles of a liquid to pass substantially horizontally through the filter so that said particles coalesce, impact, become intercepted or collected by Brownian Diffusion or a combination of these within the filter to form a liquid mass which drains downwards; and<br>
causing the downwards draining liquid to leave the filter at two or more mutually spaced stations therealong.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of operating an end-to-end arrangement of filters each of elongate tubular configuration disposed with their longitudinal axes upright, comprising the steps of;<br>
causing a gas laden with particles of a liquid to pass substantially horizontally through each of the filters so that said particles coalesce within the filters to<br>
 8<br>
form a liquid mass which drains downwards; and causing the draining liquid to leave the lower end of each filter and thereafter move clear of the other filter(s).<br>
In operating previously proposed filters of the type stated, all of the residual liquid moves from the filter or filter assembly by way of the lower end of the lowermost filter in an end-to-end assembly of two or more filters. In accordance with the present invention, the movement of the residual liquid from the filter or filter assembly is distributed with respect to the total length of the filter or filter assembly. Such distribution reduces any tendency to flood or over-saturate part of the filter or filter assembly. It is now therefore feasible to operate filters of the type stated having a relatively increased total length dimension without any consequential impairment of filter performance.<br>
Certain filters of the type stated are inserted into associated filter supports or housings or casings through circular apertures with relatively small clearance. Thus, part of the aforesaid end structure means with the aforesaid guide means must be capable of passage through such circular apertures in the case where a conventional filter is to be replaced with a filter in accordance with the present invention. Moreover, where the inside diameter of the filter is not sufficient to provide operative access for end-to-end assembly using internally accessible fixing elements, there arises a difficulty of achieving end-to-end<br>
 9<br>
assembly using externally-accessible fixing elements without exceeding the external diametral limits dictated by the said aperture.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an end-to-end assembly of filters of the type stated wherein mutually adjacent ends are interconnected by annular elements including a flange ring attached to one of the filters and having holes on a pitch circle and being axially offset from the end face of said one filter by means of an integral annular collar adjacent the inner diameter of the filter so that fixing elements extending through said holes are accessible from the outside of the filter assembly.<br>

Detailed_Description_of Embodiments<br>
Referring firstly to Figure 1 there is shown a first embodiment of a filter apparatus comprising a filter assembly, generally designated 5. In this embodiment the filter assembly 5 is hung substantially vertically from part of chemical processing installation (not shown), the part being identified by reference numeral "10".<br>
The part 10 is a portion of a housing or casing, and supports the filter assembly 5 for treating gas moving from a lower side outside of the housing 10. The gas flow is indicated by the broad arrows shown in chain dotted outline. The duty of the filter assembly S is to remove fine mist particles from the gas.   The filter assembly<br>
 11<br>
includes a plurality - in. this case four fibrous filter beds 15 which are of the type known as "fibre filters". The mechanism of fibre filters is well known and is basically a combination of impingement for particles greater than 1-2 microns in diameter, and diffusion for the finer particles where Brownian motion becomes increasingly predominant. As the gas passes through each filter bed, the small mist particles are bombarded by the gas molecules surrounding them, causing them to move in various directions towards and away from the surface and the fibres making up the filter bed,<br>
The filter assembly 5 comprises four fibrous filter beds 15 packed into an annular space 20 between first and second substantially concentric mesh or open-work tubular structure 25, 30 at least one annular member 35 being provided between each adjacent fibrous filter bed 15. In this embodiment the first and second concentric mesh or open-work tubular structures 25, 3D each comprise a single tubular member in the form of a cylinder. Thus, the filtering assembly 5 comprises a single filter body including four filter portions.<br>
Each annular member 35 comprises a ring. Each ring 13 made from a suitable material resistant to corrosion by the mist or liquid particles or by the gas. For example, the ring may be fabricated from stainless steel or from any suitable synthetic material such as PTFE or polypropylene. In this embodiment the rings are loosely retained on the assembly 5; however, in a modification the rings could be<br>
 12<br>
retained in association with the mesh structures 25, 30 e.g. by welds.<br>
The filter assembly 5 includes a gas input end 40 and a gas output end 45, the gas input 45 including a closure plate 50 thereacross so as to close an inside of the tubular structure,<br>
In this embodiment it will be appreciated that the gas 13 caused to pass from an outgide to an inside up the filter assembly S.<br>
In this case, an annular gutter 5, may be provided in the inside of the tubular structure adjacent each annular member 35. As can be seen from Figure 2, each gutter 5 is vertically offset downwardly from the respective annular member 35 .<br>
Referring now to Figure 2 there is shown a partial perspective elevation of an outer cage assembly of the filter assembly 5 with the first mesh structure 25 removed. This can be seen from Figure 2, the outer cage assembly comprises the closure plate So, a top flange plate 55 and a compression plate 56. The closure plate 50 includes a circumferential upstanding collar 60 and a substantially centrally located drainage hole 65 threadably connected to a drainage tube 70 carrying a flange 75 at a distal end. The top flange plate 55 includes a downwardly depending collar 79 and a plurality of substantially equally spaced apertures SO which may foe aligned with a plurality of the spaced apertures (not shown) provided on the structural member 10, so as to allow the filter assembly 5 to be<br>
 13<br>
retained in association with the structural member 10, e.g. by bolts or studs (not shown) passing through the aligned holes. The top flange plate 55 also carries a plurality of upstanding rods 85 capable of reception into a plurality of apertures 90 in the compression plate 56. The top flange plate 55, further carries two opposing lifting lugs 91. A gasket - e.g. a PTPE gasket - (not shown) may be provided between the assembled compression plate 56 and to flange plate SS. The closure plate 50 and the flange plate 55 may be secured to the mesh structure 25 by any suitable means, e.g. welds.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown a partial perspective elevation of an inner cage assembly 95 of the filter assembly 5 with the second mesh structure 3 0 removed. As can be seen from Figure 3 the inner cage assembly 95 comprises a bottom ring 100 and a top ring 105 carrying a meah closure disc 10 thereacross. The rings 100, 105 may be retained at respective ends of the second mesh structure 30 by suitable means, e.g. welds.<br>
The various components of the outer and inner cage assembles 55, 95 may be made from suitably resistant materials, e.g. stainless steel or alternatively titanium, glass reinforced plastics (e.g. with a resin coating particularly for use in chlorine plants] or a high nickel alloy.<br>
The filter assembly 5 of the present invention may be adapted for use in many applications, for example, a scrubbing tower of a copper smelter, an ammonium nitrate<br>
 14<br>
plant, a sulphuric acid plant, or a hydrofluoric acid plant.<br>
It will be appreciated that for ease of assembly of the filter assembly 5 each annular member 35 may be glued to at least one adjacent fibrous filter bed provided that such glue is resistant to the mist or liquid particles and to the gas.<br>
Alternatively, each annular member 25 may comprise a<br><br>
hardened end of a fibrous filter bed. The end may be hardened, for example, by predipping the end in a molten polymer.<br>
In use, gas carrying mist or liquid particles is caused to pass up the assembly 5 from outside to inside thereby causing mist or liquid to be caught in the assembly 5. Liquid caught in each bed 15, drains down the bed to the annular member 35 at the bottom of the bed 15 thereby causing the liquid to be diverted from entering the next lowest bed 35. If no gutter 51 iS provided the. liquid caught by the bed 15 is caused to flow down the inner surface adjacent the inner surface of the next lowest and subsequent beds 15. In this way the annular rings 35 tend to obviate or mitigate saturation of the beds 15, If a gutter S1 is provided then liquid draining from a bed 15 is tended to be directed inwardly away from lower beds 15.<br>
Typically, the velocity of gas flow through the beds 15 will be around 0.15 m/s and normally not above 0.2 m/a with a relatively high liquid loading, e.g. around l to 25 g/m3 Of gas.  Further adjacent annular members 3 5 may be<br>
 15<br>
spaced by between lm and 10m and typically 3m or 6m. It is envisaged that the filter assembly 5 could pass 0.0345 m3/h of gas as compared to 0.0129 m3/h for a conventional candle filter.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 there is shown a second embodiment of a filter assembly 205 supported by a part 210 of a chemical processing installation (not shown) . The assembly 205 includes a plurality of filter beds 206.<br>
Each individual filter bed 20S is of elongate tubular construction, consisting of concentric outer and inner wire mesh cages 211 and 212 respectively with the fibrous filter-bed medium 213 packed into the annular space defined by the cages 211, 212. The ends of the annular spaces between the cages 211, 212 are closed by end structure means as described in further detail hereunder. The length L of each filter is approximately four metres,- the internal diameter of the inner cage 212 is approximately 50 centimetres; and the width of the annular apace between the cages 211, 212 is approximately 5 centimetres.<br>
The lower filter in Figure 4 is secured to the housing 210 by fixing means 214 (typically screws, bolts or studs) extending through mating holes in the housing 210 and a flange ring 215 constituting the lower end structure means of the lower filter. The upper end of the lower filter is provided with a relatively wide flange ring 216 constituting top end structure means closing the annular space of the lower filter. In the upper filter of Figure 4, the end structure means consists of a lower flange ring<br>
 16<br>
217 which is secured to the flange ring 216 by fixing means 214. A gasket or seal {not shown) would, in practice, be typically provided between the flange rings 216, 217. The flange ring 217 has an external diameter large enough to ensure that the peripheral edge of the flange ring 217 is disposed clear of the lower filter as explained further herebelow. End structure means at the upper end of the upper filter is constituted by a flange ring 218 and top cover 219 with a seal or gasket (not shown) secured by fixing means 214.<br>
In operation of the filter assembly of Figure 4, although the gas flow velocity is low and the pressure difference across the filter medium is low, nevertheless the inside-to-outside gas flow induces a drainage pattern as shown by the heavy lines running from inside to outside in the upper and lower filter elements. Thus, drainage of liquid at the lower end of each filter tends to flow outwardly at the bottom portion of each filter. With the arrangement shown in Figure 4, drainage from the upper filter element leaves the filter assembly at the level of the flange ring 217, and is discharged clear of the lower filter from the outer periphery of flange ring 217. Thus, the liquid mass collected by the upper filter is not passed on to the lower filter, and in this way flooding or over-saturation of the lower filter is avoided.<br>
In Figure 5, components corresponding with those in Figure 4 are given the same reference numerals. In Figure 5, the filter assembly is inserted downwards through an<br>
 17<br>
aperture 320 in the hoUSing 310, and gas flow enters the filter assembly from outside to inside below the aperture 320, and emerges from the housing 10 above the aperture 320.<br>
In Figure 5, the upper and lower filter elements are identical with those in Figure 4. In Figure 5, the lowermost flange ring 315 is secured to a lower end cover 321 provided with a liquid drainage outlet 322 associated with a drainage duct (not shown) which is isolated from the gas within the housing 310. The upper end of the filter assembly in Figure 5 is provided with an annular mounting ring 323 which is welded to the outer cage 311 of the upper filter element and also to the flange ring 318. The filter assembly is secured to the housing 310 by fixing means 314 in a conventional manner.<br>
The lower end of the upper filter in Figure 5 is provided with a simple flange ring 3 24. provided with holes for fixing means 314. The lower filter element in Figure 5 has upper end structure means in the form of an annular flange 325 which itself closes the annular space at the upper end of the lower filter element. The flange 325, at its inner diameter ia integral with an annular collar 326 which, in turn, is integral with a further annular flange 327 provided with holes on a pitch circle for the fixing means 314. Thus, the flange 327 is offset with respect to the upper end of the lower filter providing external acceas to the fixing means 314. With this arrangement, it is possible to assemble the upper and lower filter elements<br>
 18<br>
whilst they are vertically suspended by means of an on-site crane or lifting apparatus prior to insertion through the aperture 320.<br>
Between the flange ring 324 and the flange 327, there is secured a guide means in the form o£ a dished flange 32B which serves to discharge liquid draining from the upper filter clear of the lower filter in the manner explained with reference to Figure 4. Whereas, in Figure 5, the liquid guide means as mentioned iS provided by a separate flange ring 328, in the Figure 4 embodiment the liquid guide means is constituted by the outer portion of the flange ring 317.<br>
In Figure 6, the structure is almost identical with that of Figure 5, except that the dished flange ring or guide means 3 28 is omitted in Figure 6 and replaced by a liquid guide collar 294 which is welded to the outer peripheral edge of the flange 425 and shrouds the upper end portion of the lower filter bed. In Figure 6, the gas flow direction is reversed as compared with that in Figure 5, so that drainage from the upper filter element is from inside to outside at the lower end thereof. Thus, liquid draining from the upper filter element drops to the outside of the flange rings 427 and 425 and is then guided by the collar 429 to drop clear of the lower filter element.<br>
In the arrangements described above, it will be noted that the liquid which is discharged clear of a lower filter falls through de-misted gas issuing from the lower filter. Thus, in conditions of high mist loading and/or irrigation,<br>
 19<br>
there is the possibility that some of the liquid falling clear of the lower filter may be re-entrained in the flow of "clean" gas- This possibility of re-entrainment is substantially avoided by means of the modifications which will now be described with reference to Figures 7 to 9 in which parts corresponding with parts in Figures 4 and 5 are given the reference numerals used in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
In Figure 7, the outer periphery of the flange ring 217 is provided with an upstand 217A. Also, the inner periphery of the flange ring 217 is provided with an upstand 217B. The upatands 217A and 217B define an annular channel or trough of depth sufficient only to retain a layer of liquid draining from the upper filter bed 213. One or more tubular ducts 217C, each typically of 10 mm diameter bore, communicate with apertures in the flange ring 217 so that the liquid thereon is discharged through the tube or tubes 217C which are of length sufficient to carry the discharging liquid to the vicinity of the lower end of the lower filter bed. Thus, the liquid discharging from the upper filter bed is carried through the de-misted gas issuing from the lower filter bed without risk of re-entrainment.<br>
In Figures 8 and 9, the construction shows how the principle of Figure 7 can be used in the case where the gas flow is from the outside to the inside of the lower filter bed, and with minimal obstruction to gas flow through the vicinity of the connection between the lower and upper filter beds.  In Figures 8 and 9, as compared with Figure<br>
 20<br>
5, the dished annular guide ring 328 is replaced by a plain annular flange ring 328A having an outer peripheral upetand 328B and an inner peripheral upetand 328C thus forming a shallow channel or trough for retaining a layer of liquid draining from the upper filter bed 313. In order to present minimum obstruction to flow of gas upwards through the filter assembly, the flange ring 328A is shaped as can be Been in. Figure 9 to provide at least one inwardly projecting portion for accommodating a guide tube 328D. The upstand 328C is shaped to match the inner profile of the flange ring 328A.<br>
It will be appreciated that the embodiments hereinbefore described are given by way of example only, and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Particularly, it will be understood that the present invention is of particular benefit in situations of high liquor bondings, i.e. high miet/liquid levels in the gas, e.g. above 5,000 mg/m3 and particularly around 25000 mg/m3 liquid/gas.<br>
Further modifications of the constructions described above fall within the scope of the present invention include the use of three or more filter elements in a filter assembly. Also, it will be understood that the parameters of length and nominal diameter of filter elements place no limitation on the inventive drainage method.<br>
In a modification, for example, one of or each fibrous filter bed  may  comprise  at  least  two  substantially<br>
 21<br>
concentrically arranged filter beds, wherein, in use gas or air is caused to pass through the concentrically arranged beds in series or to pass through at least one of the concentrically arranged beds, In such an arrangement an annular member may be provided at an end of one or more or each concentric bed. Alternatively, a single annular member may be provided at adjacent ends of adjacent concentric beds.<br>
It will further be appreciated that the annular member or "ring" may not only space adjacent fibrous filter beds but may also provide structural/mechanical support to the filter apparatus. This is envisaged to be of particular note in so-called high velocity filters.<br>
Particularly, whereas a primary function of the annular members is to enhance the drainage rate of the liquid collected in the fibrous filter bed, there sometimes exists a need to divide a fibrous filter bed used in applications of relatively high gas velocity or in applications whose nature is corrosive to the fibrous filter bed, primarily to give added structural and mechanical support to the fibrous filter bed over its length. Such a use of the annular members may thus act to increase the drainage rate of liquid from the fibrous filter bed, though the increased drainage rate may not be required or inherently beneficial. The inclusion of such mechanical support annular members thus having the same implied benefits as those specifically included for the purpose of drainage, would most likely be singular in<br>
 22<br>
filters of less than 1000 to 1220mm long and multiple in filters of greater than 1000 to 1220mm long, and are not solely included for the purpose of connecting two or more sections of fibrous filter bed of lengths greater than 2000mm each.<br>
