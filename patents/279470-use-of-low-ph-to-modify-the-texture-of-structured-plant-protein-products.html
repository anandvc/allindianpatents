DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides animal meat compositions or simulated meat compositions. Typically, both compositions include structured plant protein products comprising protein fibers that are substantially aligned. The compositions may optionally include animal meat. The invention also provides a process for producing the compositions under conditions of acidic pH. It has been discovered that producing an animal meat composition or a simulated animal meat composition under conditions of low pH, such as at the pH level found in rigor meat, results in meat composition with improved meat-like qualities. By way of example refemng to Figures 3 and 4, the animal meat composition depicted in Figure 3 was<br>
prepared at an acidic pH of 5.6, while the animal meat composition of Figure 4 was prepared at a relatively neutral pH of 6.7, As shown in the photographic images, the animal meat composition produced under acidic conditions has a consistency that is fibrous, and has a more meat-like texture compared to the animal meat composition produced under neutral pH conditions, which has a more gummy and less cohesive consistency. Because of the improved texture and flavor provided by the pH reduction, the compositions of the invention may be utilized in a vanety of applications to simulate whole muscle meat.<br>
(I)       Structured Plant Protein Products<br>
The animal meat compositions and simulated animal meat compositions of the invention each comprise structured plant protein products comprising protein fibers that are substantially aligned, as descnbed in more detail in 1(f) below. In an exemplary embodiment, the structured plant protein products are extrudates of plant materials that have been subjected to the extrusion process detailed in 1(e) below  Because the structured plant protein products utilized in the invention have protein fibers that are substantially aligned in a manner similar to animal meat, the animal meat compositions and simulated animal meat compositions generally have the texture and feel of compositions containing all animal meat producing the meat-like texture consumers seek.<br>
(a)     protein-containing starting materiais<br>
A variety of ingredients that contain protein may be utilized in an extrusion process to produce structured plant protein products suitable for use in animal meat compositions and simulated animal meat compositions  While ingredients compnsing proteins derived from plants are typically used, it is also envisioned that proteins derived from other sources, such as animal sources, may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention   For example, a dairy protein selected from the group consisting of casein, caseinates, whey protein, milk protein concentrate, milk protein isolate, and mixtures thereof may be utilized. In an exemplary embodiment, the dairy protein is whey protein. By way of further example, an egg protein selected from<br>
the group consisting of ovalbumin, ovoglobulin, ovomucin, ovomucoid, ovotransfernn, ovovitella, ovovitellin, albumin globulin, and vitellin may be utilized.<br>
It is envisioned that other ingredient types in addition to proteins may be utilized. Not limiting examples of such ingredients include sugars, starches, oligosacchandes, soy fiber and other dietary fibers, and gluten.<br>
It is also envisioned that the protein-containing starting matenals may be gluten-free. Because gluten is typically used in filament formation during the extrusion process, if a gluten-free starting material is used, an edible crosslink agent may be utilized to facilitate filament formation. Non- limiting examples of suitable crosslink agents include Konjac glucomannan (KGM) flour, edible crosslink agents such as transglutanimnase, beta glucan, such as Pureglucan® manufactured by Takeda (USA), calcium salts, and magnesium salts. One skilled in the art can readily determine the amount of cross linker needed, if any, in gluten-free embodiments.<br>
Irrespective of its source or ingredient classification, the ingredients utilized in the extrusion process are typically capable of forming extrudates (structured plant protein products) having protein fibers that are substantially aligned   Suitable examples of such ingredients are detailed more fully below.<br>
(i)       plant protein matenals<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, at least one ingredient derived from a plant will be utilized to form the protein-containing materials. Generally speaking, the ingredient will comprise a protein. The amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized can and will vary depending upon the application. For example, the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 40% to about 100% by weight   In another embodiment, the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 50% to about 100% by weight. In an additional embodiment, the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 60% to about 100% by weight. In a further embodiment, the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 70% to about 100% by weight   In still another embodiment, the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 80% to about 100% by weight. In a further embodiment,<br>
the amount of protein present in the ingredient(s) utilized may range from about 90% to about 100% by weight.<br>
The ingredient(s) utilized in extrusion may be derived from a variety of suitable plants   By way of non-limiting example, suitable plants include legumes, corn, peas, canola, sunflowers, sorghum, rice, amaranth, potato, tapioca, arrowroot, canna, lupin, rapeseed, wheat, oats, rye, barley, and mixtures thereof<br>
In one embodiment, the ingredients are isolated from wheat and soybeans. In another exemplary embodiment, the ingredients are isolated from soybeans  Suitable wheat derived protein-containing ingredients include wheat gluten, wheat flour, and mixtures thereof.

In each of the foregoing embodiments, the soybean material may be combined with one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of a starch, flour, gluten, a dietary fiber, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable examples of protein-containing material isolated from a vanety of sources are detailed in Table A, which shows various protein ingredient combinations.<br>

In each of the embodiments delineated in Table A, the combination of protein-containing materials may be combined with one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of a starch, flour, gluten, a dietary fiber, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the protein-containing material comprises protein, starch, gluten, and fiber   In an exemplary embodiment, the protein-containing material comprises from about 45% to about 65% soy protein on a dry matter basis; from about 20% to about 30% wheat gluten on a dry matter basis; from about 10% to about 15% wheat starch on a dry matter basis; and from about 1% to about 5% fiber on a dry matter basis. In each of the foregoing embodiments, the protein-containing matenal may comprise dicalcium phosphate, L-cysteine or combinations of both dicalcium phosphate and L-cysteine.<br>
(ii)      soy protein materials<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, as detailed above, soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, soy flour, and mixtures thereof may be utilized in the extrusion process  The soy protein materials may be derived from whole soybeans in accordance with methods generally known in the art. The whole soybean may be standard soybeans (i.e., non genetically modified soybeans), commoditized soybeans, hybndized soybeans, genetically modified soybeans, preserved soybeans, and combinations thereof<br>
Generally speaking, when soy isolate is used, anisolate is preferably selected that is not a highly hydrolyzed soy protein isolate   In certain embodiments, highly hydrolyzed soy protein isolates, however, may be used in combination with other soy protein isolates provided that the highly hydrolyzed soy<br>
protein isolate content of the combined soy protein isolates is generally less than about 40% of the combined soy protein isolates, by weight. In another embodiment, a membrane filtered soy isolate may be used. Examples of soy protein isolates that are useful in the present invention are commercially available, for example, from Solae, LLC (St Louis, MO.), and include SUPRO® 500E, SUPRO® EX 33, SUPRO® 620, and SUPRO® 545    In an exemplary embodiment, a form of SUPRO® 620 is utilized as detailed in Example 3<br>
Alternatively, soy protein concentrate or soy flour may be blended with the soy protein isolate to substitute for a portion of the soy protein isolate as a source of soy protein material. Typically, if a soy protein concentrate is substituted for a portion of the soy protein isolate, the soy protein concentrate is substituted for up to about 55% of the soy protein isolate by weight  In another embodiment, the soy protein concentrate is substituted for up to 50% of the soy protein isolate by weight. In another embodiment, the substitute is 40% by weight of the soy protein. In another embodiment, the amount substituted is up to about 30% of the soy protein isolate by weight. Examples of suitable soy protein concentrates useful in the invention include Procon, Alpha 12 and Alpha 5800, which are commercially available from Solae, LLC (St. Louis, MO.). If a soy flour is substituted for a portion of the soy protein isolate, the soy flour is substituted for up to about 35% of the soy protein isolate by weight  The soy flour should be a high protein dispersibility index (PDI) soy flour.<br>

cotyledon fiber matenals that are commercially available from Solae, LLC (St. Louis, MO)<br>
(b)      pH-reducing agent<br>
The animal meat compositions and simulated meat compositions are generally produced under conditions of low pH, such as at the pH of post rigor meat In general, a low pH is achieved by contacting the composition with a pH-lowenng agent. It is envisioned that the pH-lowenng agent may be suitably contacted with the compositions, or products forming the composition, at vanous stages of the composition's manufacture. In one embodiment, the pH-lowering agent is contacted with the plant protein material and the mixture is then extruded according to the process detailed in 1(e).  Alternatively, the pH-lowenng agent may be contacted with the structured plant protein product after it has been extmded, as detailed below in II and III.<br>
Irrespective of the stage of manufacture at which the pH-lowenng agent is introduced, suitable agents include those that will lower the pH of the composition to approximately the pH level of post rigor meat. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, the pH of post rigor meat can and will vary from animal to animal, but the pH will generally be acidic (i.e., below approximately 7 0)   In one embodiment, the pH IS below approximately 7.0. In another embodiment, the pH is between about 6.0 to about 7.0. In still another embodiment, the pH is below approximately 6.0. In another embodiment, the pH is between about 5.0 and about 6.0. In one alternative of this embodiment, the pH is between about 5.2 to about 5.9. In still another alternative of this embodiment, the pH is between about 5.4 to about 5 8   In an additional alternative of this embodiment, the pH is about 5.6. In another embodiment, the pH is below approximately 5 0   In a further embodiment, the pH is between about 4 0 to about 5.0. In still another embodiment, the pH is below approximately 4.0.<br>
Several pH-lowering agents are suitable for use in the invention. The pH-lowenng agent may be organic. Alternatively, the pH-lowering agent may be Inorganic.   In exemplary embodiments, the pH-lowenng agent is a food grade edible acid. Non-limitmg acids suitable for use in the invention include acetic, lactic, hydrochlonc, phosphoric, citric, tartaric, malic, and combinations thereof<br>
As will be appreciated by a sl<illed artisan the amount of ph-lowering agent utilized in process invention can and will vary depending upon several parameters. including selected desired ph stage manufacture at which is added. by way non-limiting example combined with plant protein material for application where added before extrusion mixture or either animal meat composition simulated applications after may range from about to on a dry matter basis. another embodiment an additional ph-lowenng other embodiments></illed>
(c)	additional ingredients<br>
A variety of additional ingredients may be added to any of the combinations of protein-containing matenals and pH lowering agents above without departing from the scope of the invention   For example, antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, and combinations thereof may be included. Antioxidant additives include BHA, BHT, TBHQ, vitamins A, C and E and denvatives, and various plant extracts such as those containing carotenoids, tocopherols or flavonoids having antioxidant properties, may be included to increase the shelf-life or nutritionally enhance the animal meat compositions or simulated meat compositions.   The antioxidants and the antimicrobial agents may have a combined presence at levels of from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably, from about 0.05% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight of the protein-containing materials that will be extruded.<br>
(d)	moisture content<br>
As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the moisture content of the protein-containing matenals can and will vary depending upon the thermal process the combination is subjected to, e g , retort cooking, microwave cooking, and extrusion<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the thermal process is extrustion. Generally speaking, when the thermal process is extrusion, the moisture content may range from about 1% to about 80% by weight. In low moisture extrusion applications, the moisture content of the protein-containing materials may range from about 1% to about 35% by weight. Alternatively, in high moisture extrusion applications, the moisture content of the protein-containing matenals may range from about 35% to about 80% by weight. In an exemplary embodiment, the extrusion application utilized to form the extrudates is low moisture. An exemplary example of a low moisture extrusion process to produce extrudates having proteins with fibers that are substantially aligned is detailed in 1(f) and Example 3 and 4.<br>
(e) extrusion of the protein-containing plant material<br>
A suitable extrusion process for the preparation of plant protein material comprises introducing the plant protein matenai and other ingredients into a mixing tank (i.e., an ingredient blender) to combine the ingredients and form a dry blended plant protein material pre-mix. As detailed above, in certain embodiments the pH-lowering agent may be contacted with the plant matenai before the mixture is extruded   The dry blended plant protein matenai pre-mix is then transferred to a hopper from which the dry blended ingredients are introduced along with moisture into a pre-conditioner to form a conditioned plant protein material mixture. The conditioned matenai is then fed to an extruder in which the plant protein material mixture is heated under mechanical pressure generated by the screws of the extruder to form a molten extrusion mass. The molten extrusion mass exits the extruder through an extrusion die<br>
(i)      extrusion process conditions<br>
Among the suitable extrusion apparatuses useful in the practice of the present invention is a double barrel, twin-screw extruder as descnbed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,600,311. Further examples of suitable commercially available extrusion apparatuses include a CLEXTRAL Model BC-72 extruder manufactured by Clextral, Inc (Tampa, FL); a WENGER Model TX-57 extruder, a WENGER Model TX-168 extruder, and a WENGER Model TX-52 extruder all manufactured by Wenger Manufacturing, Inc (Sabetha, KS). Other conventional extruders suitable for use in this<br>
invention are descnbed, for example, in U.S Pat Nos. 4,763,569, 4,118,164, and 3,117,006, which are hereby incorporated by reference m their entirety. A single-screw extruder could also be used in the present invention. Examples of suitable, commercially available single-screw extrusion apparatuses include the Wenger X-175, the Wenger X-165, and the Wenger X-85 all of which are available from Wenger Manufacturing, Inc.<br>
The screws of a twin-screw extruder can rotate within the barrel in the same or opposite directions. Rotation of the screws in the same direction is referred to as single flow or co-rotating whereas rotation of the screws in opposite directions is referred to as double flow or counter-rotating. The speed of the screw or screws of the extruder may vary depending on the particular apparatus; however, it is typically from about 250 to about 450 revolutions per minute (rpm). Generally, as the screw speed increases, the density of the extrudate will decrease  The extrusion apparatus contains screws assembled from shafts and worm segments, as well as mixing lobe and ring-type shearing elements as recommended by the extrusion apparatus manufacturer for extruding plant protein material.<br>
The extrusion apparatus generally comprises a plurality of heating zones through which the protein mixture is conveyed under mechanical pressure pnor to exiting the extrusion apparatus through an extrusion die. The temperature in each successive heating zone generally exceeds the temperature of the previous heating zone by between about 10°C to about 70°C. In one embodiment, the conditioned pre-mix is transferred through four heating zones within the extrusion apparatus, with the protein mixture heated to a temperature of from about 100°C to about 150°C such that the molten extrusion mass enters the extrusion die at a temperature of from about 100X to about ISO^C   One skilled in the art could adjust the temperature either heating or cooling to achieve the desired properties. Typically, temperature changes are due to work input and can happen suddenly.<br>
The pressure within the extruder barrel is typically between about 50 psig to about 500 psig , preferably between about 75 psig to about 200 psig. Generally, the pressure within the last two heating zones is from about 100 psig to about 3000 psig, preferably between about 150 psig to about 500 psig   The barrel pressure is dependent on numerous factors including, for example, the extruder screw<br>
speed, feed rate of the mixture to the ban-el, feed rate of water to the barrel, and the viscosity of the molten mass within the barrel.<br>
Water is injected into the extruder barrel to hydrate the plant protein material mixture and promote textunzation of the proteins. As an aid in forming the molten extrusion mass, the water may act as a plasticizing agent. Water may be introduced to the extruder barrel via one or more injection jets. Typically, the mixture in the barrel contains from about 15% to about 35% by weight water  The rate of introduction of water to the barrel is generally controlled to promote production of an extrudate having desired characteristics. It has been observed that as the rate of introduction of water to the barrel decreases, the density of the extrudate decreases. Typically, less than about 1 kg of water per kg of protein is introduced to the ban-el Preferably, from about 0.1 kg to about 1 kg of water per kg of protein are introduced to the barrel.<br>
(ii)      preconditioning<br>
In a pre-conditioner, the protein-containing matenal and other ingredients can be preheated, contacted with moisture, and held under controlled temperature and pressure conditions to allow the moisture to penetrate and soften the individual particles. In another embodiment, in the pre-conditioner the pressure condition is ambient. The preconditioner contains one or more paddles to promote uniform mixing of the protein and transfer of the protein mixture through the preconditioner. The configuration and rotational speed of the paddles vary widely, depending on the capacity of the preconditioner, the extruder throughput and/or the desired residence time of the mixture in the preconditioner or extruder barrel. Generally, the speed of the paddles is from about 100 to about 1300 revolutions per minute (rpm)  Agitation must be high enough to obtain even hydration and good mixing.<br>
Typically, the protein-containing material is pre-conditioned prior to introduction into the extrusion apparatus by contacting the pre-mix with moisture (i.e., steam and/or water). Preferably the protein-containing matenal is heated to a temperature of from about 25°C to about 80°C, more preferably from about 30'C to about 40°C in the preconditioner using appropriate water temperatures.<br>
Typically, the protein-containing material pre-mix is conditioned for a penod of about 30 to about 60 seconds, depending on the speed and the size of the conditioner. The pre-mix is contacted with steam and/or water and heated in the pre-conditioner at generally constant steam flow to achieve the desired temperatures. The water and/or steam conditions (i.e., hydrates) the pre-mix, increases its density, and facilitates the flowability of the dried mix without interference prior to introduction to the extruder barrel where the proteins are texturized. If low moisture pre-mix is desired, the conditioned pre-mix may contain from about 1 % to about 35% (by weight) water. If high moisture pre-mix is desired, the conditioned pre-mix may contain from about 35% to about 80% (by weight) water.<br>
The conditioned pre-mix typically has a bulk density of from about 0.25 g/cm^ to about 0.6 g/cm^. Generally, as the bulk density of the pre-conditioned protein mixture increases within this range, the protein mixture is easier to process.<br>
(ill)     extrusion process<br>
The conditioned pre-mix is then fed into an extruder to heat, shear, and ultimately plasticize the mixture   The extruder may be selected from any commercially available extruder and may be a single screw extruder or preferably a twin-screw extruder that mechanically shears the mixture with the screw elements.<br>
Whichever extruder is used, it should be run in excess of about 50% motor load. Typically, the conditioned pre-mix is introduced to the extrusion apparatus at a rate of between about 16 kilograms per minute to about 60 kilograms per minute   In another embodiment, the conditioned pre-mix is introduced to the extrusion apparatus at a rate between 20 kilograms per minute to about 40 kilograms per minute, the conditioned pre-mix is introduced to the extrusion apparatus at a rate of between about 26 kilograms per minute to about 32 kilograms per minute. Generally, it has been observed that the density of the extrudate decreases as the feed rate of pre-mix to the extruder increases.<br>
The pre-mix is subjected to shear and pressure by the extruder to plasticize the mixture  The screw elements of the extruder shear the mixture as well as create pressure in the extruder by forcing the mixture forwards though the extruder and through the die. Preferably, the screw motor speed is set to a speed of from about 200<br>
rpm to about 500 rpm, and more preferably from about 300 rpm to about 450 rpm, which moves the mixture through the extruder at a rate of at least about 20 kilograms per minute, and more preferably at least about 40 kilograms per minute. Preferably the extruder generates an extruder barrel exit pressure of from about 50 to about 3000 psig.<br>
The extruder controls the temperature of the mixture as it passes through the extruder denaturing the protein in the mixture. The extruder includes a means for controlling the temperature of the mixture to ensure temperatures of from about 100°C to about 180°C   Preferably the means for controlling the temperature of the mixture in the extruder comprises extruder barrel jackets into which heating or cooling media such as steam or water may be introduced to control the temperature of the mixture passing through the extruder. The extruder may also include steam injection ports for directly injecting steam into the mixture within the extruder. The extruder preferably includes multiple heating zones that can be controlled to independent temperatures, where the temperatures of the heating zones are preferably set to control the temperature of the mixture as it proceeds through the extruder  For example, the extruder may be set in a four temperature zone arrangement, where the first zone (adjacent the extruder inlet port) is set to a temperature of from about 80°C to about 100°C, the second zone is set to a temperature of from about 100°C to 135°C, the third zone is set to a temperature of from 135°C to about 1 SO'C, and the fourth zone (adjacent the extruder exit port) is set to a temperature of from about 150°C to about 180°C. The extruder may be set in other temperature zone arrangements, as desired. For example, the extruder may be set in a five temperature zone arrangement, where the first zone is set to a temperature of about 25°C, the second zone is set to a temperature of about 50°C, the third zone is set to a temperature of about 95°C, the fourth zone is set to a temperature of about 130°C, and the fifth zone is set to a temperature of about 150°C.<br>
The mixture forms a melted plasticized mass in the extruder.   A die assembly is attached to the extruder in an arrangement that permits the plasticized mixture to flow from the extruder exit port into the die assembly, wherein the die assembly consists of a die and a back plate. Additionally, the die assembly produces substantial alignment of the protein fibers within the plasticized mixture as it flows through the die assembly. The back plate in combination with the die creates at least<br>
one central chamber that receives the melted plasticized mass from the extruder through at least one central opening. From the at least one central chamber, the melted plasticized mass is directed by flow directors into at least one elongated tapered channel. Each elongated tapered channel leads directly to an individual die aperture The extrudate exits the die through at least one aperture in the periphery or side of the die assembly at which point the protein fibers contained within are substantially aligned. It is also contemplated that the extrudate may exit the die assembly through at least one aperture in the die face, which may be a die plate affixed to the die<br>
The width and height dimensions of the die aperture(s) are selected and set prior to extrusion of the mixture to provide the fibrous material extrudate with the desired dimensions. The width of the die aperture(s) may be set so that the extrudate resembles from a cubic chunk of meat to a steak filet, where widening the width of the die aperture(s) decreases the cubic chunk-like nature of the extrudate and increases the filet-like nature of the extrudate. Preferably the width of the die aperture(s) is/are set to a width of from about 5 millimeters to about 40 millimeters.<br>
The height dimension of the die aperture(s) may be set to provide the desired thickness of the extrudate. The height of the aperture(s) may be set to provide a very thin extrudate or a thick extrudate   Preferably, the height of the die aperture(s) may be set to from about 1 millimeter to about 30 millimeters, and more preferably from about 8 millimeters to about 16 millimeters.<br>
It is also contemplated that the die aperture(s) may be round. The diameter of the die aperture(s) may be set to provide the desired thickness of the extrudate. The diameter of the aperture(s) may be set to provide a very thin extrudate or a thick extrudate. Preferably, the diameter of the die aperture(s) may be set to from about 1 millimeter to about 30 millimeters, and more preferably from about 8 millimeters to about 16 millimeters<br>
The extnjdate can be cut after exiting the die assembly. Suitable apparatuses for cutting the extrudate after it exits the die assembly include flexible knives manufactured by Wenger Manufacturing, Inc. (Sabetha, KS) and Clextral, Inc (Tampa, FL). A delayed cut can also be done to the extrudate. One such example of a delayed cut device is a guillotine device<br>
The dryer, if one is used, generally compnses a plurality of drying zones in which the air temperature may vary. The extrudate will be present in the dryer for a time sufficient to produce an extrudate having the desired moisture content. Thus, the temperature of the air is not important, if a lower temperature is used longer drying times will be required than if a higher temperature is used   Generally, the temperature of the air within one or more of the zones will be from about 100°C to about 185°C  At such temperatures the extrudate is generally dned for at least about 5 minutes and more generally, for at least about 10 minutes. Suitable dryers include those manufactured by Wolvenne Proctor &amp; Schwartz (Mernmac, MA.), National Drying Machinery Co (Philadelphia, PA), Wenger (Sabetha, KS), Clextral (Tampa, FL), and Buehler (Lake Bluff, IL)<br>
The desired moisture content may vary widely depending on the intended application of the extrudate. Generally speaking, the extruded matenal has a moisture content of from about 6% to about 13% by weight, if dried  Although not required in order to separate the fibers, hydrating in water until the water is absorbed is one way to separate the fibers. If the protein matenal is not dried or not fully dned, its moisture content is higher, generally from about 16% to about 30% by weight.<br>
The dried extrudate may further be comminuted to reduce the average particle size of the extrudate. Suitable gnnding apparatus include hammer mills such as Mikro Hammer Mills manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Ltd. (England), Fitzmill® manufactured by the Fitzpatrick Company (Elmhurst, IL), Comitrol® processors made by Urschel Laboratories, Inc (Valparaiso, IN), and roller mills such as RossKamp Roller Mills manufactured by RossKamp Champion (Waterloo, IL).<br>
(f) characterization of the structured protein products<br>
The extrudates produced m 1(e) typically compnse the structured plant protein products comprising protein fibers that are substantially aligned. In the context of this invention "substantially aligned" generally refers to the arrangement of protein fibers such that a significantly high percentage of the protein fibers forming the structured plant protein product are contiguous to each other at less than approximately a 45° angle when viewed in a horizontal plane  Typically, an average of at least 55% of the protein fibers comprising the structured plant protein product are substantially<br>
aligned. In another embodiment, an average of at least 60% of the protein fibers compnsing the structured plant protein product are substantially aligned. In a further embodiment, an average of at least 70% of the protein fibers comprising the structured plant protein product are substantially aligned, in an additional embodiment, an average of at least 80% of the protein fibers compnsing the structured plant protein product are substantially aligned   In yet another embodiment, an average of at least 90% of the protein fibers comprising the structured plant protein product are substantially aligned. Methods for determining the degree of protein fiber alignment are known in the art and include visual determinations based upon micrographic images By way of example, Figures 1 and 2 depict micrographic images that Illustrate the difference between a structured plant protein product having substantially aligned protein fibers compared to a plant protein product having protein fibers that are significantly crosshatched. Figure 1 depicts a structured plant protein product prepared according to l(a)-l(e) having protein fibers that are substantially aligned. Contrastingly, Figure 2 depicts a plant protein product containing protein fibers that are significantly crosshatched and not substantially aligned. Because the protein fibers are substantially aligned, as shown in Figure 1, the structured plant protein products utilized in the invention generally have the texture and consistency of cooked muscle meat. In contrast, extrudates having protein fibers that are randomly oriented or crosshatched generally have a texture that is soft or spongy<br>
In addition to having protein fibers that are substantially aligned, the structured plant protein products also typically have shear strength substantially similar to whole meat muscle. In this context of the invention, the term "shear strength" provides one means to quantify the formation of a sufficient fibrous network to impart whole-muscle like texture and appearance to the plant protein product  Shear strength IS the maximum force in grams needed to shear through a given sample. A method for measuring shear strength is descnbed in Example 1. Generally speaking, the structured plant protein products of the invention will have average shear strength of at least 1400 grams   In an additional embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of from about 1500 to about 1800 grams. In yet another embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of from about 1800 to about 2000 grams   In a further embodiment, the<br>
structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of from about 2000 to about 2600 grams. In an additional embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of at least 2200 grams. In a further embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of at least 2300 grams   In yet another embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of at least 2400 grams   In still another embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of at least 2500 grams   In a further embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have average shear strength of at least 2600 grams.<br>
A means to quantify the size of the protein fibers formed in the structured plant protein products may be done by a shred charactenzation test. Shred charactenzation is a test that generally determines the percentage of large pieces formed in the structured plant protein product. In an indirect manner, percentage of shred characterization provides an additional means to quantify the degree of protein fiber alignment in a structured plant protein product. Generally speaking, as the percentage of large pieces increases, the degree of protein fibers that are aligned within a structured plant protein product also typically increases. Conversely, as the percentage of large pieces decreases, the degree of protein fibers that are aligned within a structured plant protein product also typically decreases.   A method for determining shred characterization is detailed in Example 2. The structured plant protein products of the invention typically have an average shred characterization of at least 10% by weight of large pieces. In a further embodiment, the structured plant protein products have an average shred characterization of from about 10% to about 15% by weight of large pieces. In another embodiment, the structured plant protein products have an average shred characterization of from about 15% to about 20% by weight of large pieces. In yet another embodiment, the structured plant protein products have an average shred characterization of from about 20% to about 50% by weight of large pieces. In another embodiment, the average shred characterization is at least 20% by weight, at least 21% by weight, at least 22% by weight, at least 23% by weight, at least 24% by weight, at least 25% by weight, or at least 26% by weight large pieces<br>
Suitable structured plant protein products of the invention generally have protein fibers that are substantially aligned, have average shear strength of at<br>
least 1400 grams, and have an average shred characterization of at least 10% by weight large pieces. More typically, the structured plant protein products will have protein fibers that are at least 55% aligned, have average shear strength of at least 1800 grams, and have an average shred characterization of at least 15% by weight large pieces. In an exemplary embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have protein fibers that are at least 55% aligned, have average shear strength of at least 2000 grams, and have an average shred characterization of at least 17% by weight large pieces. In another exemplary embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have protein fibers that are at least 55% aligned, have average shear strength of at least 2200 grams, and have an average shred characterization of at least 20% by weight large pieces. In another exemplary embodiment, the structured plant protein products will have protein fibers that are at least 55% aligned, have average shear strength of at least 2400 grams, and have an average shred charactenzation of at least 20% by weight large pieces<br>
(II)      Animal Meat<br>
The animal meat compositions, in addition to structured plant protein product, also comprise animal meat. By way of example, meat and meat ingredients defined specifically for the various structured vegetable protein patents include intact or ground beef, pork, lamb, mutton, horsemeat, goat meat, meat, fat and skin of poultry (domestic fowl such as chicken, duck, goose or turkey) and more specifically flesh tissues from any fowl (any bird species), fish flesh derived from both fresh and salt water fish such as catfish, tuna, sturgeon, salmon, bass, muskie, pike, bowfin, gar, paddlefish, bream, carp, trout, walleye, snakehead and crappie, animal flesh of shellfish and crustacean origin, animal flesh trim and animal fissues derived from processing such as frozen residue from sawing frozen fish, chicken, beef, pork etc , chicken skin, pork skin, fish skin, animal fats such as beef fat, pork fat, lamb fat, chicken fat, turkey fat, rendered animal fat such as lard and tallow, flavor enhanced animal fats, fractionated or further processed animal fat tissue, finely textured beef, finely textured pork, finely textured lamb, finely textured chicken, low temperature rendered animal fissues such as low temperature rendered beef and low temperature rendered pork, mechanically separated meat or mechanically deboned meat (MDM)<br>
(meat flesh removed from bone by various mechanical means)such as mechanically separated beef, mechanically pork, mechanically separated fish, mechanically separated chicken, mechanically separated turkey, any cooked animal flesh and organ meats derived from any animal species. Meat flesh should be extended to include muscle protein fractions derived from salt fractionation of the animal tissues, protein ingredients derived from isoelectric fractionation and precipitation of animal muscle or meat and hot boned meat as well as mechanically prepared collagen tissues and gelatin. Additionally, meat, fat, connective tissue and organ meats of game animals such as buffalo, deer, elk, moose, reindeer, caribou, antelope, rabbit, bear, squirrel, beaver, muskrat, opossum, raccoon, armadillo and porcupine as well as well as reptilian creatures such as snakes, turtles and lizards should be considered meat.<br>
It IS also envisioned that a variety of meat qualities may be utilized in the invention depending upon the product's intended use. For example, whole meat muscle that is either ground or in chunk or steak form may be utilized   In an additional embodiment, mechanically deboned meat (MDM) may be utilized. In the context of the present invention, "MDM" is a meat paste that is recovered from a vanety of animal bones, such as, beef, pork and chicken bones, using commercially available equipment MDM IS generally a comminuted product that is devoid of the natural fibrous texture found in intact muscles. In other embodiments, a combination of MDM and whole meat muscle may be utilized.<br>
(Ill)     Process for Producing Food Products Comprising Animal Meat and Simulated Animal Meat Compositions<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a process for producing food products comprising animal meat compositions. An animal meat composition may comprise a mixture of animal meat and structured plant protein product, or it may comprise structured plant protein product  The process generally compnses hydrating the structured plant protein product, reducing its particle size if necessary, optionally flavonng and coloring the structured plant protein product, optionally mixing it with animal meat, and further processing the composition into a food product<br>
The pH-lowering agent may be added at several stages during the preparation of the composition of the invention   When an animal meat composition is<br>
prepared, the pH-lowering agent may be combined with the animal meat to form a mixture and then the mixture may be combined with the structured plant protein product. Alternatively, the structured plant protein product may be combined with the animal meat to form a mixture and then the mixture may be combined with the pH-lowering agent. In an additional embodiment, the animal meat, structured plant protein product, and pH-lowering agent may all be combined substantially simultaneously. When a<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims prionty from Provisional Application Senal No 60/828,298 filed on October 5, 2006 and US Application Serial No. 11/868,087 filed on October 5, 2007, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides animal meat compositions and simulated meat compositions. The invention also provides processes for producing the animal meat compositions and simulated animal meat compositions. In the process, a pH-lowering agent is generally utilized.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Food scientists have devoted much time developing methods for preparing acceptable meat-like food products, such as beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shellfish analogs, from a wide vanety of plant proteins. Soy protein has been utilized as a protein source because of its relative abundance and reasonably low cost  Extrusion processes typically prepare meat analogs. The dry blend is processed to form a fibrous material. To date, meat analogs made from high protein extrudates have had limited acceptance because they lack meat-like texture characteristics and mouth feel   Rather, they are characterized as spongy and chewy, largely due to the random, twisted nature of the protein fibers that are formed. Most are used as extenders for ground, hamburger-type meats<br>
50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or 75% by weight  Consequently, the concentration of the hydrated structured plant protein product in the animal meat composition may be about 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% by weight. In one embodiment, the animal meat composition is mixed with the hydrated structured plant protein at a temperature of-2°C to about 12°C.<br>
Depending upon the food product, the animal meat is typically precooked to partially dehydrate the flesh and prevent the release of those fluids during further processing applications (e.g., such as retort cooking), to remove natural liquids or oils that may have strong flavors, to coagulate the animal protein and loosen the meat from the skeleton, or to develop desirable and textural flavor properties. The pre-cooking process may be carried out in steam, water, oil, hot air, smoke, or a combination thereof  The animal meat is generally heated until the internal temperature IS between 60°C and 85°C. In one embodiment, the animal meat composition is mixed with the hydrated structured plant protein at an elevated temperature corresponding to the temperature of the meat product.<br>
(c)      optionally add a coloring agent<br>
It is also envisioned that the animal meat composition or simulated meat composition may be combined with a suitable coloring agent such that the color of the composition resembles the color of animal meat it simulates. The compositions of the invention may be colored to resemble dark animal meat or light animal meat. By way of example, the composition may be colored with a natural colorant, a combination of natural colorants, an artificial colorant, a combination of artificial colorants, or a combination of natural and artificial colorants. Suitable examples of natural colorants approved for use in food include annatto (reddish-orange), anthocyanins (red to blue, depends upon pH), beet juice, beta-carotene (orange), beta-APO 8 carotenal (orange), black currant, burnt sugar; canthaxanthin (pink-red), caramel, carmine/carminic acid (bright red), cochineal extract (red), curcumin (yellow-orange); lutein (red-orange), mixed carotenoids (orange), monascus (red-purple, from fermented red nee), paprika, red cabbage juice, riboflavin (yellow), saffron, titanium dioxide (white), and turmeric (yellow-orange). Suitable examples of artificial colorants approved for use in food include FD&amp;C (Food Drug &amp; cosmetics) Red Nos. 3 (carmosine), 4 (fast red E), 7<br>
(ponceau 4R), 9 (amaranth), 14 (erythrosine), 17 (allura red), 40 (allura red AC) and FD&amp;C Yellow Nos. 5 (tartrazine), 6 (sunset yellow) and 13 (quinoline yellow). Food colorants may be dyes, which are powders, granules, or liquids that are soluble in water. Alternatively, natural and artificial food colorants may be lake colors, which are combinations of dyes and insoluble matenals. Lake colors are not oil soluble, but are oil dispersible, they tint by dispersion<br>
The type of colorant or colorants and the concentration of the colorant or colorants will be adjusted to match the color of the animal meat to be simulated. The final concentration of a natural food colorant may range from about 0 01% percent to about 4% by weight.<br>
The color system may further comprise an acidity regulator to maintain the pH in the optimal range for the colorant. The acidity regulator may be an acidulent. Examples of acidulents that may be added to food include citnc acid, acetic acid (vinegar), tartaric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, phosphonc acid, sorbic acid, and benzoic acid  The final concentration of the acidulent in an animal meat composition may range from about 0.001% to about 5% by weight. The final concentration of the acidulent may range from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight. The final concentration of the acidulent may range from about 0 1% to about 1% by weight The acidity regulator may also be a pH-raising agent, such as disodium diphosphate<br>

Weigh a sample of the structured plant protein product and place It in a heat sealable pouch and hydrate the sample with approximately three times the sample weight of room temperature tap water. Evacuate the pouch to a pressure of about 0.01 bar and seal the pouch. Permit the sample to hydrate for about 12 to about 24 hours. Remove the hydrated sample and place it on the texture analyzer base plate oriented so that a knife from the texture analyzer will cut through the diameter of the sample. Further, the sample should be oriented under the texture analyzer knife such that the knife cuts perpendicular to the long axis of the textured piece   A suitable knife used to cut the extrudate is a model TA-45, incisor blade manufactured by Texture Technologies (USA). A suitable texture analyzer to<br>
perform this test is a model TA, TXT2 manufactured by Stable Micro Systems Ltd. (England) equipped with a 25, 50, or 100 kilogram load. Withm the context of this test, shear strength is the maximum force in grams needed to shear through the sample<br>
Example 2. Determination of Shred Characterization<br>
A procedure for determining shred characterization may be performed as follows  Weigh about 150 grams of a structured plant protein product using whole pieces only. Place the sample into a heat-sealable plastic bag and add about 450 grams of water at 25° C. Vacuum seal the bag at about 150 mm Hg and allow the contents to hydrate for about 60 minutes. Place the hydrated sample in the bowl of a Kitchen Aid mixer model KM14G0 equipped with a single blade paddle and mix the contents at 130 rpm for two minutes  Scrape the paddle and the sides of the bowl, returning the scrapings to the bottom of the bowl   Repeat the mixing and scraping two times. Remove ~200g of the mixture from the bowl. Separate the ~200g of mixture into one of two groups  Group 1 is the portion of the sample having fibers at least 4 centimeters in length and at least 0.2 centimeters wide. Group 2 is the portion of the sample having strands between 2.5 cm and 4.0 cm long, and which are &gt; 0.2 cm wide Weigh each group, and record the weight Add the weight of each group together, and divide by the starting weight (e g ~200g) This determines the percentage of large pieces in the sample. If the resulting value is below 15%, or above 20%, the test is complete If the value is between 15% and 20%, then weigh out another ~200g from the bowl, separate the mixture into groups one and two, and perform the calculations again.<br>
Example 3. Production of Structured Plant Protein Products<br>
The following extrusion process may be used to prepare the structured plant protein products of the invention, such as the soy structured plant protein products utilized in Examples 1 and 2. Added to a dry blend mixing tank are the following   1000 kilograms (kg) Supro® 620 (soy isolate), 440 kg wheat gluten, 171 kg wheat starch, 34 kg soy cotyledon fiber, 9 kg dicalcium phosphate, and 1 kg L-cysteine. The contents are mixed to form a dry blended soy protein mixture  The dry blend is then transferred to a hopper from which the dry blend is introduced into a preconditioner along with 480 kg of water to form a conditioned soy protein pre-mixture  The<br>
conditioned soy protein pre-mixture is then fed to a twin-screw extrusion apparatus (Wenger Model TX-168 extruder by Wenger Manufacturing, Inc. (Sabetha, KS))at a rate of not more than 25 kg/minute. The extrusion apparatus comprises five temperature control zones, with the protein mixture being controlled to a temperature of from about 25°C in the first zone, about 50°C in the second zone, about 95°C in the third zone, about 130°C in the fourth zone, and about 150°C in the fifth zone. The extrusion mass IS subjected to a pressure of at least about 400 psig in the first zone up to about 1500 psig in the fifth zone. Water, 60 kg per hour, is injected into the extruder barrel, via one or more injection jets in communication with a heating zone. The molten extruder mass exits the extruder barrel through a die assembly consisting of a die and a backplate. As the mass flows through the die assembly the protein fibers contained within are substantially aligned with one another forming a fibrous extrudate. As the fibrous extrudate exits the die assembly, it is cut with flexible knives and the cut mass is then dried to a moisture content of about 10% by weight.<br>
Example 4. Production of Structured Plant Protein Products with Adjusted pH<br>
The following extrusion process may be used to prepare the structured plant protein products with a reduced pH of the invention, such as the soy structured plant protein products utilized in Examples 1 and 2. Added to a dry blend mixing tank are the following: 1000 kilograms (kg) Supro® 620 (soy isolate), 440 kg wheat gluten, 171 kg wheat starch, 34 kg soy cotyledon fiber, 9 kg dicalcium phosphate, and 1 kg L-cysteine. In addition, an amount of a pH modifying agent, such as citric acid (CA) or sodium carbonate (SC) was added during the dry blending   Example pH values are demonstrated below in Table 1. The contents are mixed to form a dry blended soy protein mixture. The dry blend is then transferred to a hopper from which the dry blend is introduced into a preconditioner along with 480 kg of water to form a conditioned soy protein pre-mixture  The conditioned soy protein pre-mixture is then fed to a twin-screw extrusion apparatus (Wenger Model TX-168 extruder by Wenger Manufacturing, Inc. (Sabetha, KS))at a rate of not more than 25 kg/minute. The extrusion apparatus comprises five temperature control zones, with the protein mixture being controlled to a temperature of from about 25°C in the first zone, about 50°C in the second zone, about 95°C in the third zone, about 130X in the fourth zone, and about 150°C in the fifth<br>
zone. The extrusion mass is subjected to a pressure of at least about 400 psig in the first zone up to about 1500 psig in the fifth zone. Water, 60 kg per hour, is injected into the extruder barrel, via one or more injection jets in communication with a heating zone The molten extruder mass exits the extruder barrel through a die assembly consisting of a die and a backptate. As the mass flows through the die assembly the protein fibers contained within are substantially aligned with one another forming a fibrous extrudate As the fibrous extrudate exits the die assembly, it is cut with flexible knives and the cut mass is then dned to a moisture content of about 10% by weight<br>

Example 5. Comparison of the Texture of Animal Meat Compositions Produced at different pH Values<br>
To create an animal meat composition with a fibrous, more meatlike texture and appearance, a strategy was devised to produce the composition at the pH level found in rigor meat. When beef, pork, or poultry animals are slaughtered, oxygen becomes limiting and anaerobic metabolism results in the conversion of glycogen to lactic acid with an accompanied reduction in pH. Prior to slaughter, muscle tissue is in the neutral pH range  After slaughter, pH typically drops to about 5.4 to 5.8, and the drop is due to the accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle tissue. Lactic acid was chosen as a pH-lowering agent since it is naturally occurring in muscle tissue after slaughter. The lactic acid used in Treatment 2 is PURAC® FCC 88 (Purac Amenca, Lincolnshire, IL 60069) lowers the pH to within the level of 5.4 to 5.8 as would be found in post rigor meat. To test the affect of the pH-lowering agent the meat blend in<br>
Treatment 1 does not include an amount of lactic acid; conversely, the meat blend in Treatment 2 does include an amount of lactic acid.<br>
The animal meat composition blends were prepared identically, except for the addition of the pH-lowering agent (lactic acid). For each the following ingredients were mixed at 3-4°C. The list and percentage by weight of the ingredients follows in Table 2. The tempered chicken MDM was ground to 6.35 mm and the beef was ground to 3.175 mm prior to blending. The SUPRO®MAX 5050 (plant protein product) was placed into the single paddle mixer (Model AV50, Talleres Cato, s a , Spam) to hydrate with water for 20 minutes while shredding under vacuum. The chicken MDM, beef, sodium nitrite and salt were then added to the shredded SUPRO®MAX 5050 and vacuum mixed for 10 minutes. All the remaining ingredients were then added to the mixer and mixed for 5 minutes under vacuum. At this stage the pH of Treatment 2 was lowered to 5.6 by the addition of the PURAC® FCC 88 lactic acid  The pH of the Treatment 1 blend was not adjusted. The meat blend was then formed into patties using a Hollymatic forming machine (Hollymatic Corporation, Countryside, IL). All the patties were then cooked to an internal temperature of 71°C at 177°C in a Combo Oven (Groen Combination Steamer Oven, Model CC20-E Convection Combo, Groen, Jackson, MS) with the convection heat and steam combination option selected. All products were then frozen for storage pnor to further testing   Pnor to texture and shear analysis samples were brought to room temperature, approximately 23°C.<br>
Table 2: Formulations for the meat blends. <br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The pH of the two products was recorded throughout processing by combining 20 g of each Treatment test product with 180 g of distilled water in an Oster® blender for 15 seconds on high and measunng the pH with an Orion pH meter (Model 41OA). The pH of treatment 2 was lowered to a post rigor meat pH level. The results from these pH measurements are in Table 3.<br>
 <br>
Table 3: pH of reatments at different stages of the test product production process<br>
 <br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The texture of the final products was analyzed by 5-bladed Kramer Shear Cell and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) using the 100 mm round platen at 60% compression with the TA-HDi Texture Analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Ltd., Surrey, UK) with the samples at 25°C. Results of these measurements are shown in Table 4<br>
Table 4. Textural properties of patties. Means with like superscnpts are not significantly different<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As Table 4 demonstrates the patties from Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 are distinguishable. Figures 5a and 5b demonstrate that the area under<br>
the curve, or the amount of work it took to reach the same force value was significantly different showing a difference between the Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 meat blend.<br>
Further, TPA measurements revealed significant differences in hardness, cohesiveness, gummlness, chewmess and resilience between the two treatments. TPA figures are displayed in Figures 6a and 6b to show the texture differences in the two treatments. These differences demonstrate the textural difference found in the meat product when a pH-lowering agent was added to the blend dunng mixing<br>
Example 6. Comparison of tlie Sliear Value of Simulated Meat Compositions Produced at Different pH Values<br>
Testing was completed to show the hydrated structured plant protein piece alone could be altered in texture by the use of acids, thus demonstrating textural differences found in the structured plant protein piece when a pH-modifying agent was added during the creation of the hydrated structured plant protein. To test this, SUPRO®MAX 5053 (Solae, LLC (St. Louis. MO)) pieces were hydrated in a solution of distilled water with differing dilutions of 55% citric acid solution under static vacuum for more than 1 hour. Pieces were then placed into tuna cans with distilled water. These cans were sealed and retorted at 118.3°C for 75 min. The cans were then cooled m an ice water bath and held at refrigeration temperatures until samples were ready for texture and shear analysis   Pnor to texture and shear analysis samples were brought to room temperature, approximately 23°C.<br>
Pnor to retorting the pH of each treatment was measured by mixing 20 g of SUPRO®MAX 5053 piece with 180 g of distilled water in an Oster® blender for about 15 seconds. The pH of this was then measured using the Orion pH meter (Model 41OA)  The same process was used to measure the pH of the piece following retorting and cooling  These measurements can be found in Table 5<br>
Table 5. Measurements of the pH of the SUPRO®MAX 5053 piece pre-retort and post retort<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The texture of the treatments was measured by using the TA-45 Incisor knife on the TA-HDi Texture Analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Ltd , Surrey, UK) with the samples at 25'C. The probe measured the shear force in grams needed to shear the SUPRO®MAX 5053 piece  Textura! data can be found in Table 6.<br>
Table 6: Texturai properties of retorted SUPRO®MAX 5053 pieces as related to pH. Means with like superscripts are not significantly different.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Shear force values were different for pH levels of 5.96 to 6.39 compared to 4 05 to 5.48. Figures 7a and 7b show shear analysis for two of the treatments and show the texturai difference between different pH treatments (treatment A at 6.39 pH vs treatment C at 5.48 pH). As the table and figures demonstrate the addition of a pH-lowenng agent affected the texture of the structured plant protein piece Specifically, the shear force is not significantly different among Treatments C-F, but Treatments C-F are significantly different that Treatments A-B. Thus demonstrating a significant difference among meat blends with a pH of 6 and above when compared to meat blends with a pH below 6.<br>
Example 7. Comparison of the Simulated Meat Compositions Produced at Different pl4 Values<br>
In this example a strategy was devised to create a meat composition with a fibrous, more meat-like texture and appearance using a hydrated structured plant protein with varying pH values. The animal meat composition blends were prepared similar, and as previously described in Example 5 except the hydrated structured plant protein ingredients were created similar to Example 3 with varying pH<br>
levels. For each the following ingredients were mixed at 3 - 4°C. The list and percentage by weight of the ingredients follows in Table 7, The beef was ground to 3mm prior to blending   The SUPRO®MAX 5050 was placed into the single paddle mixer (Model AV50, Talleres Cato, s.a., Spain) to hydrate with water for 20 minutes while shredding under vacuum  The beef and flavoring agent (Givaudan Flavors Corporation) were then added to the shredded SUPRO®MAX 5050 and vacuum mixed for 10 minutes  The SUPRO®MAX 5050 ingredient had varying pH levels for each treatment to create the varying pH levels for the meat blend as demonstrated in Table 8. All the remaining ingredients were then added to the mixer and mixed for 5 minutes under vacuum. The amount of pH-adjusting material used to create the SUPRO®MAX 5050 ingredient was dependent on the end pH result desired. The meat blend was then formed into patties using a Hollymatic forming machine (Hollymatic Corporation, Countryside, IL)  All the patties were then cooked to an internal temperature of 71 °C at 177°C in a Combo Oven (Groen Combination Steamer Oven, Model CC20-E Convection Combo, Groen, Jackson, MS) with the convection heat and steam combination option selected. All products were then frozen for storage pnor to further testing.<br>
The pH of the Treatments (meat blends) were recorded by combining 20 g of each Treatment test product with 180 g of distilled water in an Oster® blender for 15 seconds on high and measunng the pH with an Onon pH meter (Model 410A)  The results from these pH measurements are in Table 8<br>

The texture of the treatments was measured by using the TA-45 Incisor knife on the TA-HDi Texture Analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Ltd., Surrey, UK) with the samples at 25°C. The probe measured the shear force m grams needed to shear the SUPRO®MAX 5050 piece  Textural data can be found in Figure 8. The control or all meat product produced a peak force (shear strength) of 15,890. As the figure demonstrates the pH has an affect on the texture of the meat product<br>
The percentage cook yield measured the percentage weight of the cooked meat product compared to the uncooked weight  As shown, the cooking yields for the meat products are relatively similar, typically in the 80.0% yield. The cooked weight data can be found in Figure 9  The control or all meat product produced a cooked weight percentage of 74 6%<br>
Example 8. Comparison of the Hydrated Structured Plant Protein Compositions at Different pH Values<br>
The hydrated structured plant protein compositions were prepared according to the steps used in Example 4   Varying amount of pH modifying ingredients, such as sodium carbonate and citnc acid, were used to obtain the desired pH level for the hydrated structured plant protein   Table 9 demonstrates the hydrated structured<br>
