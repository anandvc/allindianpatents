COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A    PROCESS    FOR    THE    PREPARATION    OF    2-HYDROXY-6-TRIFLUOROMETHYLPYRIDINE"<br>
SYNGNTA LIMITED, European regional Centre, Priestley Road, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7YH, England, and DOW AGROSCIENCE LLC, of 9330 Zionsville Road, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46268-1054, United States of America<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyridine which is useful in the manufacture of certain agriculture products and to a chemical process.<br>
Processes for preparing 2-hydroxypyridines by the hydrolysis of 2-chloropyridines are described in the chemical literature. Thus, UK Patent No. 288,628 describes the preparation of 2-hydroxypyridine by the hydrolysis of 2-chloropyridine with solid potassium hydroxide at 175 °C. It also describes the preparation of 2-hydroxy-5-nitropyridine by the hydrolysis of the corresponding chloropyridine with (a) concentrated hydrochloric acid in a bomb tube at 150 °C and (b) with 2-normal caustic soda lye under reflux.<br>
US Patent No. 4,942,239 describes the preparation of 2-hydroxypyridine by the hydrolysis of 2-chloropyridine with an aqueous concentrated potassium hydroxide solution in the presence of a tertiary alcohol, such as ferr-butyl or tert-amyl alcohol, under reflux at atmospheric pressure.   A solvent-based process has also been described for the preparation of 2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyridine in, for example, US Patent No. 3,609,158. In this patent 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) is hydrolysed by heating with aqueous sodium hydroxide under reflux.<br>
2-Hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyridine can readily be prepared in good yield by the alkaline hydrolysis of 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine in a solvent such as DMSO or tert-amyl alcohol.  On a large scale, however, solvent-based processes are generally undesirable because of the environmental and safety implications and the need for solvent recovery systems.<br>
The treatment of 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine with 35% hydrochloric acid at 150 °C results in only a trace of hydrolysis and with aqueous sodium hydroxide under reflux may result in no hydrolysis at all. Treatment with solid base leads to hydrolysis but causes processing difficulties.<br>
The process of the present invention, which may be operated in the absence of an organic solvent, is high yielding and provides a more practical procedure.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of 2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyridine which comprises reacting 2-fiuoro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine or a mixture of 2-fluoro-6-trifIuoromethylpyridine and 2~chIoro-6-<br><br><br>
trifluoromethylpyridine with an alkali metal hydroxide at a temperature of from 50 °C_to 160 °C and acidifying the product so formed.<br>
The alkali metal hydroxide is preferably sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the latter generally being the more effective. It may be used in aqueous form, in which case, the aqueous base solution strength should be at least 5% w/v and is suitably in the range of "9 to 85% w/v, for example, 9 to 60% w/v, typically up to about 50% w/v. Alternatively, if the starting material contains a high level of the chlorinated pyridine component, for example, 50% or more, it is advantageous to dissolve it in a suitable solvent such as a tertiary alcohol, for example rerr-butyl or rerr-amyl alcohol, an aromatic solvent such as xylene, an inert ketone, or a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide, and to slurry the alkali metal hydroxide in this solution.<br>
Two or more mole equivalents of base are required to ensure full conversion of the pyridine to pyridone. About 2.2 equivalents have been found generally satisfactory, based on pure pyridine starting material. Thus, the normal working range will be from 2 to 3, preferably from 2.1 to 2.3, equivalents of base to pyridine starting material. However, to enable the process to be operated at higher temperatures at atmospheric pressure, either a greater strength or a greater excess of alkali metal hydroxide, or both, may be used. For example, 2.2 to 2.3 mole equivalents of about 50% w/v strength potassium hydroxide will enable the process to be operated at temperatures up to 130 °C, while 14 mole equivalents of about 80% strength potassium hydroxide allows the process to be operated at temperatures up to about 150 °C.<br>
The temperature of the reaction should be in the range of 50 °C to 160 °C and will normally be in the range of 80 °C to 130 °C. Temperatures of 90 °C to 130 °C are favoured.<br>
When a temperature above 100 °C is used, the reaction can be carried out either at atmospheric pressure by using a greater strength and/or greater excess of alkali metal hydroxide as previously discussed, or at higher pressures in a sealed vessel, for example, in an autoclave whose material of construction can withstand the effects of aqueous alkali at temperatures of up to 160 °C and the autogenous pressures generated. Suitably such a vessel is constructed from a nickel alloy such as inconel, monel or hastelloy. Normally pressures of 4 to 5 bar are generated at temperature of 150 °C to 160 °C.<br>
The process is conveniently carried out by adding the pyridine or mixed pyridine starting material to a stirred aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide and heating the resulting two-phase reaction mixture to a temperature of between 80 °C and 130 °C, typically<br><br>
100 °C to 130 °C, at atmospheric pressure. The progress of reaction may be followed by the<br>
periodic analysis of samples using, for instance, qualitative gas chromatography. When the reaction is adjudged complete, the reaction mixture is acidified and the pyridone isolated by filtration and washed and dried as required. In a preferred recovery procedure, the reaction mixture is acidified to about pH 5 using, for example, an inorganic acid such as concentrated hydrochloric acid, while maintaining the temperature at about 40 °C, for instance from 35 °C to 45 °C. It is then cooled to about 10 °C, for instance from 5 °C to 15 °C, before the product is isolated.<br>
While these procedures are convenient, they are not limiting on the operation of the invention process. Thus the starting material may be added progressively to the aqueous base or vice versa; or the two may be added together in an "all-in" process. The progressive addition of starting material to aqueous base (either continuously or gradually in portions) has been found particularly effective in controlling the reaction exotherm generated in large-scale production. Alternatively, it may be possible to feed streams of the starting material and base together into a reactor in a continuous or semi-continuous process. In addition, it may be advantageous, particularly when a high level of chlorinated pyridine component is present in the starting material, to employ a solvent as previously described (this can assist in solubilising a mixed pyridine starting material), or to increase the temperature by allowing the pressure to rise or to increase the concentration of the alkali metal hydroxide. It may also be advantageous to use a phase transfer catalyst such as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt, for example tetrabutylammonium bromide, or a crown ether or a polyethylene glycol variant, or a catalyst such as potassium iodide.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for preparing 2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyridine from 2-fluoro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine, which is either pure or contains 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine as a minor component or impurity. Typically a      mixed 2-fluoro-/2-chloro- starting material will contain the components in the ratio of      from95:5 to 99.9:0.l. The process is, however, equally useful for hydrolysing mixed pyridine starting materials, for example, ones containing up to 50% or more of chlorinated material]    The 2-fluoro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine starting material is a known compound      (Chemical Abstracts Registry No. 94239-04-0) disclosed in US-A-4474599. 2-Chloro-6-^   trifluoromethylpyridine is also a known compound and its preparation is described in EP-A-0042696, EP-A-0110690 and US-A-3682936.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
