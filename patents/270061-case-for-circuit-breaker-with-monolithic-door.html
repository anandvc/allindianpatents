				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a low voltage circuit breaker which is so-<br>
called molded case circuit breaker, and particularly, to a case for a circuit breaker<br>
with a monolithic door capable of simply changing a terminal structure according<br>
to a wire engaging method.<br>
10<br>
2. Background of the Invention<br>
In general, a circuit breaker applied to a power system may be provided<br>
with a terminal portion for engaging a power source side wire and a electric load<br>
side wire. The circuit breaker may have, according to a wire engaging method, an<br>
15upper engaging-type terminal portion (so-called standard type terminal portion), a<br>
rear engaging-type terminal portion, a plug-in type terminal portion and a lug type<br>
terminal portion.<br>
	A circuit breaker with a structure capable of replacing various terminal<br>
portions according to the wire engaging method and a case therefor according to<br>
20the related art will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
	First, the related art will be described with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
	FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a circuit breaker according to the<br>
related art and a case therefor, particularly, a partially-cut perspective view<br>

power source or the electric load is engaged to short rear engaging-type terminal<br>
and long rear engaging-type terminal (refer to 6-2a and 6-2b in FIGs. 8 and 9)<br>
each of which is extended downwardly from a terminal block (not shown). Unlike<br>
15the standard type terminal block portion 6-1, this rear engaging-type terminal<br>
block portion 6-2 does not have the nut but has an insertion hole in which an<br>
upper hexagonal end portion of the short or long rear engaging-type terminal is<br>
inserted.<br>
A terminal block shown in FIG. 5 designates a plug-in type terminal block<br>
20portion 6-3, which is a terminal block in a shape that an external wire of power<br>
source or the electric load is engaged to a plug-in type terminal (not shown and<br>
refer to 6-3a in FIG. 11) extended downwardly from the terminal block. Unlike the<br>
standard type terminal block portion 6-1, this plug-in type terminal block portion 6-<br>
3 does not have the nut but has an insertion hole in which an upper hexagonal<br>
25end portion of a plug-in type terminal is inserted.<br>
3<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
A terminal block shown in FIG. 6 designates a lug type terminal block<br>
portion 6-4 in a shape that an external wire of the power source or electric load is<br>
connected in a lug (refer to the numeral 6-4a in FIG. 13). It is characteristic that<br>
the upper surface of the terminal block portion 6-4 is wide and flat suitable for the<br>
5installation of a terminal portion of a fixed contactor (refer to T in FIG. 2).<br>
FIG. 7 is a view illustrating a circuit breaker according to the related art<br>
and a case therefor, particularly, a state view illustrating an operation that an<br>
external wire is connected to a terminal portion having a standard type terminal<br>
block mounted, explanation of which will be given as follows.<br>
10	The operation of mounting the standard type terminal block can be<br>
understood by the description made with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
	After mounting the standard type terminal block, the following operation is<br>
performed such that external wires of the power source or electric load (in detail,<br>
six wires in all including three power source side three-phase wires and three<br>
15electric load side three-phase wires) are engaged to terminal portions exposed to<br>
front and rear surfaces of the lower case 2 of the circuit breaker.<br>
That is, as shown in the drawing, a wire terminal W1 of an external wire W<br>
is placed on an exposed terminal portion (reference numeral not given) of a fixed<br>
contactor.<br>
20	A coupling screw S is inserted into (passed through) the wire terminal W1<br>
to be coupled (engaged) to a screw engaging hole (not shown) formed in the<br>
terminal portion of the fixed contactor.<br>
Accordingly, the external wire W can be electrically connected to the fixed<br>

Accordingly, the connecting between the rear connecting-type terminal 6-<br>
2a or 6-2b and the rear connecting-type terminal block portion 6-2 can firmly be<br>
maintained.<br>
For additional reference, external wires may be connected to the rear<br>
lOconnecting-type terminal 6-2a or 6-2b by a method for inserting the wires through<br>
a wire connecting hole formed in a lower end portion of the rear connecting-type<br>
terminal 6-2a or 6-2b.<br>
in another connecting method, a busbar-type wire is placed on the<br>
lower end portion of the rear connecting-type terminal 6-2a or 6-2b. A bolt is<br>
15inserted through both the wire connecting hole and the busbar-type wire to<br>
be fixed by a nut, thereby engaging the wire to the terminal.<br>
With reference to FIGs. 11 and 12, the following description will be given<br>

18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
according to the related art, particularly, a perspective view shown from a lower<br>
side with an inclination angle which illustrates an operation of removing a<br>
standard type terminal block and mounting a plug-in type terminal block and a<br>
plug-in type terminal.<br>
5	First, as illustrated in FIG. 11, the standard type terminal block portion 6-1<br>
is removed in a direction indicated by an arrow.<br>
The plug-in type terminal block portion 6-3 is mounted where the removed<br>
standard type terminal block portion 6-1 has been disposed.<br>
An upper end hexagonal connecting portion of the plug-in type terminal 6-<br>
103a is upwardly inserted from a lower side of the plug-in type terminal block portion<br>
6-3. Accordingly the plug-in type terminal 6-3a is connected to the plug-in type<br>
terminal block portion 6-3.<br>
A coupling screw S is inserted into a screw engaging hole (not shown) of<br>
the terminal portion of the fixed contactor and a female screw hole (not shown)<br>
15formed in an upper end portion (head portion) of the plug-in type terminal 6-3a so<br>
as to be coupled thereto.<br>
Accordingly, the connecting between the plug-in type terminal 6-3a and<br>
the plug-in type terminal block portion 6-3 can firmly be maintained.<br>
Description will be given with reference to FIG. 12 of an operation of<br>
20engaging a circuit breaker having a plug-in type terminal block and a plug-in type<br>
terminal according to the related art and its case to a plug-in connecting base as<br>
follows.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 12, a plug-in connecting base B may include plug-in<br>
insertion holes B2 for engaging plug-in terminals of the circuit breaker having a<br>
25plug-in type terminal, and a plurality of engaging terminals B1 disposed at front<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
and rear surfaces for connecting external wires of either a power source side or a<br>
electric load side.<br>
The plug-in connecting base B as illustrated in FIG. 12 may be a base to<br>
which not only the case for the circuit breaker having the plug-in type terminal<br>
5according to the related art but also a case for a circuit breaker having a plug-in<br>
type terminal according to the present invention can be engaged.<br>
An operation of connecting the plug-in terminal of the circuit breaker<br>
having a plug-in type terminal to the plug-in connecting base B can be done by<br>
pressing and inserting the plug-in terminal of the circuit breaker into the plug-in<br>
lOinsertion hole B2 from an upper side of the plug-in connecting base B.<br>
An operation of connecting a lug-type terminal block and a lug according<br>
to the related art will be explained with reference to FIG. 13 as follows.<br>
Explaining that a lug-type terminal block portion 6-4 is assembled to a<br>
circuit breaker 1 according to the related art with reference to FIG. 13, first, the<br>
15lug-type terminal block portion 6-4 is inserted into the circuit breaker 1 in a<br>
direction to a rear surface side based upon the drawing.<br>
In more detail, rail engaging portions (reference numeral not given)<br>
formed by both concave portions between upper and lower plates of the lug-type<br>
terminal block portion 6-4 are installed onto mounting rails (reference numeral not<br>
20given) which are installed at the lower case 2 below a terminal portion T of a fixed<br>
contactor, each of which is exposed to front and rear surfaces of the circuit<br>
breaker 1 and provided on each of three phases, such that the rail engaging<br>
portions can be supported by the mounting rails. Accordingly, the lug-type terminal<br>
block portion 6-4 is assembled to the circuit breaker 1 of the related art.<br>
25	The lug 6-4a is inserted in a direction to a rear surface side based upon<br>
8<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
the drawing such that it can be positioned on the terminal portion T of the fixed<br>
contactor.<br>
Regarding the case for the terminal structure changeable circuit breaker<br>
the according to the related art which is configured and mounted as mentioned<br>
5above, from the perspective of manufacturers of the circuit breakers or installation<br>
operators of the circuit breakers, the terminal blocks should be provided according<br>
to their types to be suitable for each wiring method. Accordingly, they should keep<br>
sufficient amount of the terminal blocks according to their types in order to supply<br>
them when required.<br>
10	In addition, in the case for the terminal structure changeable circuit<br>
breaker the according to the related art, each type of terminal block has a similar<br>
structure, which make it difficult for those who have not instructed or have no<br>
experience of classification to accurately classify and use the terminal blocks.<br>
In the case for the terminal structure changeable circuit breaker the<br>
15according to the related art, each type of terminal block has a very small size with<br>
a horizontal or vertical length of 1 to 3 centimeters. Also, these tiny components<br>
are fabricated separately from the case for the circuit breaker to be thereafter<br>
assembled thereto. Accordingly, it is easy to lose the terminal blocks.<br>
Therefore, the manufacturers or installation operators of the circuit<br>
20breakers need to make personal, temporal or physical efforts for preventing the<br>
loss.<br>
Furthermore, a separation preventing structure between a terminal block<br>
and a case, for example, a separation preventing protrusion with strong intensity<br>
for preventing the separation of the terminal block while being used is generally<br>
25configured. Accordingly, if the terminal block is required to be replaced while being<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
used, when separating the terminal block to be replaced by an excessive force or<br>
by using a certain device, the terminal block or the case for the circuit breaker<br>
may be damaged.<br>
In addition, if the separation preventing structure between the terminal<br>
5block and the case is changed into a structure that can easily be separated by<br>
weak outer force, due to the difficulty of the replacement, the terminal block may<br>
easily frequently be separated from the case.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Therefore, in order to solve the drawbacks of the related art, an object of<br>
the present invention is to provide a case for a circuit breaker with a terminal<br>
structure changeable monolithic door by which manufacturers or installation<br>
operators of the circuit breaker do not have to keep various types of terminal<br>
15blocks according to wiring methods and to make an effort to prevent the loss of<br>
the terminal blocks, can prevent the separation of the terminal blocks from the<br>
case, and structure and method for changing a wiring method can be simplified.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
20there is provided a case for a circuit breaker with a terminal structure changeable<br>
monolithic door comprising: a case which accommodates components for<br>
breaking a circuit; a terminal block which provides a common platform for plural<br>
types of terminals; and a door engaged with the case in monolithic form so that it<br>
may be operable to a closed position for closing the case or an opened position<br>
25for installing a selected terminal of the plural types of terminals.<br>

install a certain type of terminal selected from the plural types of terminals.<br>
When the door 4 is opened, as shown in FIGs. 14, 15 and 17, a terminal<br>
lOportion T of a fixed contactor is exposed to the front surface of the circuit breaker<br>
1 at its front, upper and lower surfaces and both lateral surfaces. Conversely,<br>
when the door 4 is closed, as shown in FIG. 13, the terminal portion T of the fixed<br>
contactor is exposed to the front surface of the circuit breaker 1 at its upper and<br>
front surfaces.<br>
15	An unexplained reference numeral 2a in FIGs 14 to 17 designates a<br>
concave portion for accommodating the door 4 and the terminal block portion 6,<br>
and 3a designates a driver insertion hole for coupling a coupling screw.<br>
In the case according to the present invention previously described, the<br>
case 2 and 3, and more particularly, the lower case 2 and the door 4 are integrally<br>
20configured. However, as shown in the circle of FIG. 15, at a connected part<br>
between the case and the door 4 is provided a hinge portion 5a thinner than the<br>
thickness of the case and the door 4 for serving as a hinge when opening or<br>

In the case of the present invention, a terminal block portion is formed in<br>
monolithic form with the door 4. Accordingly, an operation of assembling the<br>
terminal block according to each type of terminal like in the related art is not<br>
needed to be performed.<br>
25	Thus, when installing the standard type terminal at the case of the present<br>
20	20<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
invention, only the nut 7 for the standard type terminal is pressed into the terminal<br>
block portion formed in monolithic form with the door 4, thereby completing the<br>
installation operation.<br>
The operation of connecting an external wire to the standard type terminal<br>
5is the same as that described in the related art with reference to FIG. 7,<br>
explanation of which will thusly be omitted.<br>
Second, an operation of assembling a rear connecting-type terminal or a<br>
plug-in type terminal to the case of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIGs. 19 and 20 as follows.<br>
10	The case of the present invention characteristically has a portion relatively<br>
weaker than other portions on the bottom surface of the terminal block such that<br>
the weak portion can be removed to form an insertion hole in which the rear<br>
connecting-type terminal or plug-in type terminal is inserted.<br>
The weak portion may be configured to be thinner than other portions on<br>
15the bottom surface of the terminal block.<br>
In another embodiment, the weak portion may be configured by punching<br>
a plurality of holes in correspondence with the shape of an edge of the insertion<br>
hole, thereby facilitating the removing.<br>
	In this state, the operations of assembling the rear connecting-type<br>
20terminal or the plug-in type terminal to the case according to the present invention<br>
may include a first operation of forming an insertion hole to insert the rear<br>
connecting-type terminal or the plug-in type terminal therein, a second operation<br>
of upwardly inserting the rear connecting-type terminal or the plug-in type terminal<br>
into the insertion hole, and a third operation of fixing the inserted rear connecting-<br>
25type terminal or plug-in type terminal by a screw.<br>
21<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
	The first operation is described with reference to FIG. 19. In case of an<br>
embodiment in which the weak portion is cut off by a knife or a plurality of holes<br>
are punched in correspondence with the shape of the edge of the insertion hole,<br>
the weak portion is hit by a driver, thereby removing a hexagonal portion P1 or a<br>
5circular portion P2 as indicated by arrows, resulting in forming the insertion hole.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 20, the second operation is performed by<br>
upwardly inserting the rear connecting-type terminal 6-2b or the plug-in type<br>
terminal 6-3a into the formed insertion hole.<br>
The third operation is performed by coupling a coupling screw S (not<br>
lOshown) into a female screw formed at a head portion of the rear connecting-type<br>
terminal 6-2b or the plug-in type terminal 6-3a through a driver insertion hole 3a.<br>
The third operation is the same as the operation of fixing the rear<br>
connecting-type terminal or the plug-in type terminal according to the related art<br>
with reference to FIGs. 10 and 11. Accordingly, the description of the fixing<br>
15operation will be referred.<br>
The operation of connecting an external wire to the rear connecting-type<br>
terminal can be understood by the previous description of the related art provided<br>
with reference to FIG. 9. The operation of connecting the plug-in type terminal to<br>
the plug-in connecting base can be understood by the previous description of the<br>
20related art provided with reference to FIG. 12. Thus, the explanation of those<br>
operations will not be repeated.<br>
Third, the operation of assembling the lug to the case according to the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 21.<br>
The operation of assembling the lug to the case according to the present<br>
25invention can be performed as follows. In a state of the door 4 being closed<br>
22<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
without any additional configuration, the lug 6-4a is pressed into the terminal block<br>
portion 6 or pressed into a lug-exclusive nut (not shown) in a state that the lug-<br>
exclusive nut is mounted on the terminal block portion 6.<br>
In order to change the wiring method, for example, an operation of<br>
Sreplacing the lug type terminal of FIG. 21 with the low connecting-type terminal of<br>
FIG. 20 will be described.<br>
Unlike in FIG. 12, the door 4 is opened to remove the lug by using<br>
tweezers, a driver, a hand or the like. In case that the lug-exclusive nut is<br>
mounted, the lug-exclusive nut is removed by using tweezers, a driver, a hand or<br>
10the like. Afterwards, the rear connecting-type terminal is assembled according to<br>
the assembling method of the rear connecting-type terminal as shown in FIGs. 19<br>
and 20 and then the door 4 is closed.<br>
For example, in order to replace a standard type terminal with a plug-in<br>
type terminal for changing a wiring method, as shown in FIG. 18, the door 4 is<br>
I5opened to remove the mounted nut 7 by using tweezers, a driver, a hand or the<br>
like. Afterwards, the plug-in type terminal is assembled according to the<br>
assembling method of the plug-in type terminal as shown in FIGs. 19 and 20 and<br>
then the door 4 is closed.<br>
In the case for the circuit breaker having the terminal structure<br>
20changeable monolithic door according to the present invention, it is easy to get<br>
the portion required to be replaced by opening the door. Also, the target to be<br>
replaced, namely, the lug and the nut can easily be removed by gravity when<br>
opening the door. Since the terminal block portion is formed in monolithic form<br>
with the case or the door, the terminal block does not need to be replaced,<br>
25thereby simplifying the overall process. In addition, the replacement of the<br>
23<br>
18/05/2007 14:36<br><br>
terminal by the change in the wiring method can simply be done.<br>
	As described above, in the case for the circuit breaker having the terminal<br>
structure changeable monolithic door according to the present invention, since the<br>
terminal block is formed in monolithic form with the case or the door,<br>
5manufacturers or installation operators of the circuit breaker do not have to keep<br>
various types of terminal blocks based upon wiring methods.<br>
Also, in the case for the circuit breaker having the terminal structure<br>
changeable monolithic door according to the present invention, since the terminal<br>
block portion is formed in monolithic form with the case or the door, the terminal<br>
lOblock can be prevented from its loss.<br>
In addition, in the case for the circuit breaker having the terminal structure<br>
changeable monolithic door according to the present invention, since the terminal<br>
block portion is formed in monolithic form with the door engaged to the case or<br>
the terminal block portion is formed in monolithic form with the case, a nut or<br>
15terminal can be replaced according to a required wiring method in order to change<br>
the wiring method, thereby simplifying the structure of the circuit breaker and the<br>
replacement method of the nut or terminal.<br>
