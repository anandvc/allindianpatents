COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF BISPHOSPHONIC ACH) COMPOUNDS<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of bisphosphonic acid compounds, represented by a compound of formula 1 or salts thereof More specifically the present invention relates to a process for preparation of compound of formula 1 or a salt thereof by reaction of a carboxylic acid compound of formula 2 or a salt thereof with a mixture of phosphorous acid and phosphorous trichloride (PCI3) in sulfolane.<br><br>
The present invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of bisphosphonic acid compounds of formulae 3 to 10, namely, alendronic acid, pamidronic acid, risedronic acid, zoledronic acid, ibandronic acid, minodronic acid, neridronic acid and olpadronic acid, respectively or salts thereof<br><br><br><br>
Bisphosphonate compounds have generally been prepared by the reaction of carbonyl compounds with phosphorous halides. 4-Amino-1 -hydroxybutylidene-1,1 -bisphosphonic acid (alendronic acid, a compound of formula 3) or salts thereof are prepared by the reaction of 4-aminobutyric acid with a mixture of phosphorous acid and one of the three phosphorous chlorides; viz. phosphorous trichloride (PCI3), phosphorous oxychloride (POCI3) or phosphorous pentachloride (PCI5), then quenching the reaction mixture with water followed by heating to hydrolyze the phosphorous intermediates.<br>
Different processes using a variety of different solvents/carriers have been reported in the literature for making the reaction mixture homogenous for preparation of bisphosphonates, however they have some disadvantages associated with their use.<br>
United states patent No. 4407761 (referred to herein as the '761 patent, equivalent Indian reference not available) teaches preparation of 4-anJino-l-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid besides other phosphonic acids. However, high amounts of yellow-orange solid contaitiing monophosphoric acid, phosphorous acid and different phosphonic acids, which is sticky, non-stirrable is generated. Hence, the process in not convenient for industrial scale production. Further, in the '761 patent chlorobenzene is used as the reaction medium, which is harmfiil, an irritant for skin, eyes and environmentally hazardous.<br>
United States Patent No. 4705651 (equivalent Indian reference not available) teaches a similar procedure with different molar ratios, which is still not very attractive for industrial scale up.<br><br>
United States Patent Nos. 4922007 and 5019651 (equivalent Indian reference not available) teach the use of methanesulfonic acid for solubilizing the reaction components. Methanesulfonic acid is expensive, corrosive and irritant. The reaction betv^een methanesulfonic acid and PCI3 is exothermic, which could pose problems in commercial scale operations. Also, large quantity of alkali would be required in the work up for neutralization.<br>
United States Patent No. 5908959 (equivalent Indian reference not available) teaches use of long chain glycols to attempt to preveht the solidification of the reaction mixture, however the solidification cannot be totally avoided and these glycols cannot be recycled as they get converted to their corresponding chloride derivatives, which could be potentially toxic.<br>
The PCT application WO 02/090367 teaches use of aralkyl or alkyl ethoxylates or triglycerides such as plant or animal oils for solubilization of the reaction mixture.<br>
United States Patent Application No. 2003/0013918 (equivalent Indian reference not available) teaches the use of an amine hydrochloride in preparation of bisphosphonates fi-om the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorous halide. This process involves use of concentrated hydrochloric acid as a reactant.<br>
United States Patent Application No. 2004/0043967 (equivalent Indian reference not available) discloses use of aromatic hydrocarbon or a silicone fluid as a diluent for preparation of bisphosphonic acids.<br>
The present invention provides a process wherein a water miscible neutral solvent such as sulfolane is used for preparation of bisphosphonic acid compounds, making the process safe and convenient. We have also found that water miscible neutral ether solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, glymes such as diglyme and the like can also be used for preparation of bisphosphonic acids, however sulfolane was observed to provide superior yields. The process of the present invention is suitable for industrial scale up and<br><br>
can be used commercially. Since sulfolane is water miscible and neutral, the reaction mixture can be conveniently worked up by quenching into water, the intermediates subsequently hydrolyzed^ndjhe final bisphosphonic acid product directly isolated fi-om the reaction mixture, if desired in the form of a salt thereof<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention is characterized by preparation of bisphosphonic acid, a compound of formula 1 or a salt thereof by reacting a carboxylic acid compound of formula 2 or a salt thereof with phosphorous acid and a halophosphorous compound in a water miscible and neutral solvent like sulfolane.<br>
The moiety A is a straight chain, a branched alkyl chain or a cyclic alkyl chain with up to 10 carbon atoms, which can optionally contain hetero atoms in between for e.g., oxygen and sulphur.<br>
The moiety B may be an alkyl, aralkyl, aromatic or heteroaromatic group, that may be monocyclic or polyoyclic for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, henzy\^^j^ny\, pyridinyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, imidazopyridinyl and the like, that may be unsubstituted or substituted.<br>
The substituents Ri and R2 both may be same or different and selected from hydrogen or straight chain, branched or cyclic lower alkyl. The lower alkyl are containing up to 5 carbon atoms for e.g. methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the preferred halophosphorous compound is a phosphorous chloride e.g. PCI3. PBrs, PGBrs or PBrs can also be used. The carboxylic acid compound of formula 2 or a salt thereof for example, hydrochloride sah can be used.<br>
The bisphosphonic acids can be obtained in a safe manner, in high yield and purity when usuig the process of the invention. The present invention uses sulfolane, which is relatively safe and inexpensive, water miscible neutral solvent for preparation of bisphosphonic acids. The hydrolysis of the formed phosphorous intermediates can be carried out in same reaction mixture, and if desired, the pH can be adjusted suitably, for example to about 4.3 and the sodium salt of the bisphosphonic acid can be directly<br><br>
obtained in pure form. It is observed that the process of the present invention provides compounds of formulae 4, 5 and 6 in improved yield and quality.<br>
The compound of formula 2 and the phosphorous acid in sulfolane are reacted with phosphorous trichloride at a suitable temperature, for example, between about 35°C to about 150°C, preferably at about 60 to about 70°C, at which temperature the phosphonylation reaction is completed in about 3 hours.<br>
The reaction preferably is carried out by combining the carboxylic acid compound vdth phosphorous acid in presence of sulfolane at a temperature between about 70°C and about 80°C for a time between about 1 to about 2 hours. To the reaction mixture at temperature of about 35°C to about 40°C, the halophosphorous compound like phosphorous chloride is added in small portions. The reaction mixture is heated to a temperature between about 60°C to about 70°C, preferably about 65°C to about 67°C for a period of about 2 to about 4 hours. The reaction mixture containing white solid is cooled to about 0°C to about 5°C. Then water is added carefully to the reaction mixture to get a clear solution, which is heated to about 100°C for a period of about 3 to about 4 hours. Thereafter the product bisphosphonic acid can be isolated from the reaction mixture by any means known in the art. For example, the product may be precipitated by cooling to about 0°C or by combining with a solvent like acetone and isolated by filtration, centrifijgation etc.<br>
If it is desired to isolate the bisphosphonic acid as a sodium salt thereof, then after heating the clear solution to about 100°C for a period of about 3 to about 4 hours as described above, the solution may be cooled to about 0°C to about 5°C and thereafter the pH is suitably adjusted with a base like aqueous NaOH and the precipitated salt may be isolated by a manner known in the art. Alternatively, the bisphosphonic acid is suspended in water, pH is suitably adjusted with a base like aqueous alkali or alkaline metal carbonates and the precipitated salt may be isolated by methods known in the art.<br><br>
