				<td>This invention relates to an air pollution control device. Particularly, this invention relates to an air pollution control device for use with the chimney/exhaust outlets of the power station and/or other industries. A device is also useful to use with the motor vehicles for controlling air pollution caused by the emissions/exhaust. The air pollution control devices to use with the chimneys are as such known in the art.<br>
One of the said device is a mechanical dust collector which is used to collect the dust only from the exhaust but not other harmful and polluting gases like Sulfur based pollutant and nitrogen based pollutant from the exhaust. Further it is not possible to recover the heat energy from the exhaust. Bag filters are known in the art to filter the dust particle only but not nitrogen based pollutant and sulfur. Therefore these filters are not useful and also cannot be used in the big plants due to exaurbitent cost and maintenance charges and maintenance problem.Another air pollutant control device known as electrostatic precipitator<br>
is known. The ESP.comprises heating a big cylindrical hollow body having a plurality of electrodss disposed therein. An inlet is provided at one end of the cylindrical body and an outlet is provided at other end of the body.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the device. One of the main disadvantage is that this device is only used to collect the fly ash from the flue gases of a boiler plant and not for removal of pollutants.Another disadvantage is that these devices are not capable and maintaining good performance throughout services period.<br>
Another disadvantage is that it requires a large area to install this device and the installation cost is very high. Similarly maintenance cost of this device is very high.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the device is not capable to remove/neutralize sulfur based pollutant and nitrogen based pollutant present in the flue gases.: 4 :<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the device is not capable to recover the heat energy from the flue gases and a lot of heat energy is wasted and thus a lot of fuel is required to operate the boiler.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the height of the flue gases chimney is kept very high and thus the cost of the device increases.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a novel air pollution control device for use with the chimney of the power station and other air polluting industries.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel air pollution control device having the means to recover heat energy from the flue gases.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a novel pollution control device which neutralizes/removes even the nitrogen based pollutant and sulfur based pollutant present in the air.: <br>
Still another object of this invention is  to propose  a novel air pollution control device  which  is 50%  cheaper in cost than the cost of  an  electrostatic precipitator and is almost maintenance free.<br>
Yet  another object of this invention  is  to propose  a novel air pollution control device  which  is compact  in  size and requires 50% space only  than  the space  required to install electro  static  precipitator device.<br>
Still  another  object of this  invention  is that very less electric energy is required to facilitate the  operation  of  the device and  thus  it  saves  the consumption  of electric energy as required  to  operate the E.S.P.till another object of this invention is  to provide  a  novel air pollution control  device  wherein height of the chimney is reduced substantially in  order to reduce the cost of the device.: 6 :<br>
According to this invention there is provided an air pollution control device comprising an air preheater adapted to be connected with the main air preheater provided with the boiler assembly, the flue gases outlet of said air preheater being connected to a desulfurisation chamber provided for the desulfurisation of sulphsur and being connected to an oxidation zone of a first chamber in flow communication thereof, said oxidation zone provided for converting NO2 into NO2 being connected to a NC2 and ash removal zone of said first chamber, said NO2 and ash removal zone connected to the polishing zone of a second chamber being provided to neutralize all kind of pollutants therein, said polishing zone connected to a flue gases washing zone being connected to a water settle zone provided for removing water droplets entrapped in the flue gases, the outlet of water settle zone being connected to a chimney through an induced draft fan.<br>

chamber.   The flue gases washing zone is  connected  to<br>
water  settling  chamber  provided  for  removing  water entrapped  in the flue gases.  The cross-section of  the<br>
water settling chamber is larger than the  cross-section of the other zones/chambers so as to reduce the velocity<br>
of the flue gases in order to remove the water  droplets entrapped   in the flue gases.  The outlet  provided  at<br>
the  top end of the water settling chamber is  connected to  an  exhaust  chimney through  a  enduced  draft  fan<br>
provided  to facilitate exit of the flue  gases  through chimney.   A forced draft fan is provided with  the  air<br>
preheater of the device for providing atmospheric air to the  air  preheater which is supplied to  the  main  air<br>
preheater  of  the boiler assembly of  the  power  plant after   preheating.   The  bottom  ends  of   the   said<br>
zones/chambers are provided in the conical form in order to  facilitate  the removal of the pollutants  into  the<br>
pollutant  drainage means provided below and outlets  of said zones and chamber collected therein. A water jet is<br>
provided  at one end of the pollutant drainage means  to facilitate the drainage of the pollutants with the  help<br>
of water pressure.An air pollution control device according  to a   preferred   embodiment  is  herein   described   and illustrated in the accompanying drawings whereins-fig.l shows the plan view of the device.<br>
