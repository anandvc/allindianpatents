				<td>Antioxidant composition and use thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a combination composition for the<br>
prevention and/or treatment of disorders or diseases brought about by<br>
oxidative stress, untimely early physiological apoptotic phenomena<br>
following oxidative stress and/or environmental agent-induced<br>
apoptosis.<br>
Accordingly, the composition may take the form and exert the action of<br>
a dietary supplement or of an actual medicine, depending upon the<br>
support or preventive action, or the strictly therapeutic action, which<br>
the composition is intended to exert in relation to the particular<br>
individuals it is to be used in.<br>
Diseases which can effectively be prevented or treated with the<br>
composition of the present invention include atherosclerosis,<br>
ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, stroke,<br>
cataract and other eye diseases, thyroid diseases, liver diseases, sexual<br>
impotence, Parkinson"s disease, Alzheimer"s disease and degenerative<br>
disorders affecting virus-infected patients.<br>
Oxidative stress, untimely occurring physiological apoptotic<br>
phenomena elicited by oxidative stress and the environmental agent-<br>
induced apoptosis are brought about by reactive oxygen species, ROS.<br>
ROS are highly reactive substances which form following<br>
physiologically normal metabolic reactions and during electron<br>
transportation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.<br>
Oxidative stress can be counteracted by antioxidants which are<br>
important in health maintenance through the modulation of oxidative<br>
processes taking place in the body. Oxidative damage provoked by the<br>
unregulated production of ROS has been shown as the etiological<br>
factor in a growing number of clinical disorders such as those<br>
previously listed.<br>
Mechanisms responsible for the ROS-mediated injury to cells and<br>
tissues mainly include lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and<br>
protein oxidation, but there is also evidence that ROS can induce the<br>
proceed of cell death. Indeed, unbalance in the endogenous antioxidant<br>
system can modulate cellular proliferation, either in a positive or a<br>
negative way, respectively leading to a stimulation in cell proliferation<br>
at low levels of peroxides or to apoptotic/necrotic cell death at higher<br>
concentrations.<br>
It is therefore apparent that investigating compounds able to<br>
counteract this oxidative may have a relevant clinical impact.<br>
Balanced human diets contain multiple antioxidants and there is<br>
strong evidence that additive and synergistic interactions occur among<br>
those antioxidant substances. Under a clinical perspective, this<br>
suggests that the use of combination compositions containing multiple<br>
substances with antioxidant properties has the potential to provide a<br>
significantly better protection against oxidative stress than the use of<br>
each single antioxidant alone.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide such a<br>
combination composition.<br>
It has now been found that an orally or parenterally administrable<br>
composition (i) which comprises in administrative or separately<br>
packaged the following components:<br>
(a) L-carnitine inner salt or a pharmacologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof;<br>
(b) acetyl L-carnitine inner salt or a pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt thereof;<br>
(c) a-lipoic acid;<br>
(d) coenzyrae Q10;<br>
(e) Vitamin E; and<br>
(f) selenomethionine,<br>
fully accomplishes the sought-after aim of potently counteracting<br>
oxidative stress.<br>
What is meant by a pharmacologically acceptable salt of L-carnitine<br>
and acetyl L-carnitine is any salt of these with an acid which does not<br>
give rise to unwanted toxic or side effects. These acids are well known<br>
to pharmacologists and to experts in pharmaceutical technology.<br>
Non limiting examples of such salts are the following: chloride;<br>
bromide; iodide; aspartate,, acid aspartate; citrate, acid citrate;<br>
tartrate; phosphate, acid phosphate; fumarate, acid fumarate;<br>
galactarate; glycerophosphate; glucose phosphate; lactate; maleate,<br>
acid maleate; orotate; oxalate; acid oxalate; sulphate, acid sulphate;<br>
trichloroacetate; trifluoroacetate and methane sulphonate<br>
A list of FDA-approved pharmacologically acceptable acids is given in<br>
Int. J. Pharm., 33, 1986, 201-217, the latter publication being<br>
incorporated in the present description for reference purposes.<br>
For the preparation of solid administration forms, such as, for<br>
example, tablets, pills, capsules and granulates, the use of non-<br>
hygroscopic salts is preferred.<br>
The composition of the present invention in unit dosage form (ii)<br>
comprises:<br>
(a) 20-110 mg L-carnitine inner salt or an equivalent molar amount<br>
of a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
(b) 20-110 mg acetyl L-carnitine inner salt or an equivalent molar<br>
amount of a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
(c) 70-130 mg a-lipoic acid;<br>
(d) 90-110 mg coenzyme Q10;<br>
(e) 5-15 mg Vitamin E; and<br>
(f) 40-60 mg selenomethionine.<br>
A particularly preferred composition (iii) comprises:<br>
(a) 100 mg L-carnitine inner salt;<br>
(b) 100 mg acetyl L-carnitine inner salt;<br>
(c) 100 mg a-lipoic acid;<br>
(d) 100 nag coenzyme Q10;<br>
(e) 10 mg Vitamin E; and<br>
(f) 50 mg selenomethionine.<br>
The present invention also relates to a prevention/therapeutical<br>
method which comprises administering a patient in need thereof an<br>
effective amount of the aforesaid composition (i). Patients who are<br>
staying on a multiple dose administration regimen are preferably<br>
administered the aforesaid unit dosage form (ii) and, more<br>
particularly, the unit dosage form (iii). The present method is<br>
particularly suited for patients receiving arginine supplementation<br>
since the aforesaid compositions are particularly effective for<br>
preventing/counteracting NO-indviced oxidative damages elicited by<br>
said arginine supplementation.<br>
During the last few years, diet supplements comprising arginine have<br>
become more and more recommended not only by nutritionally<br>
oriented physicians but also by cardiologists and endocrinologists<br>
Arginine decreases cholesterol more effectively than any other<br>
amiuoacid. Daily doses of 6-17 grams of arginine have been shown to<br>
lower LDL-cholesterol without affecting HDL-cholesterol and eliciting<br>
side effects. Arginine also promotes healthy coronary microcirculation<br>
in people with high cholesterol and inhibits the formation of blood<br>
clots, a main etiological factor leading to heart attacks and strokes.<br>
Infusion of arginine directly into the coronary blood vessels of angina<br>
patients was reported to dramatically restore their circulation.<br>
Arginine is an NO-precursor. NO is produced normally by many cell<br>
types and plays several roles ranging from neurotransmission to<br>
vasodilatation. By relaxing arteries NO can improve circulation-<br>
related conditions such as angina, intermittent claudication, high<br>
blood pressure and impaired brain circulation.<br>
Despite all its benefit, NO is a free radical, toxic oxidant: pulmonary<br>
toxicity can occur with levels over 50 to 100 ppm.<br>
Clinical trial<br>
The antioxidant efficacy of the composition previously indicated a (iii)<br>
was assessed in the following clinical trial. The presentation form of<br>
the composition was as sachets.<br>
1.1 Study design<br>
The trial was a 16-week randomised trial. A total of 20 healthy<br>
subjects (12 men, 8 women) were enrolled in the study. The subjects<br>
had to fulfil the following inclusion criteria: non-smokers, not talcing<br>
vitamin/antioxidant or oestrogen supplements, thyroxin, or lipid-<br>
lowering drugs; normal plasma glucose, hepatic and renal function<br>
tests; no acute medical conditions at least three months prior to entry<br>
into the study. Participants were advised to not adopt any particular<br>
lifestyle, to adhere to their usual diet and physical activity during the<br>
course of the experiments and not to vary their consumption of vitamin<br>
rich foods; none were taking any additional supplements or<br>
medications during the study period. Participants gave written<br>
informed consent and were requested to report on compliance on a<br>
weekly basis.<br>
Participants were assigned to receive antioxidant supplements in the<br>
form of 1 sachet of composition (iii) per day over a 3-week period. The<br>
sachet was taken daily in the morning after meals. Control group A (5<br>
subjects) received only acetyl L-carnitine and L-carnitine and control<br>
group B (6 subjects) was given only selenomethionine, a-tocopherol,<br>
a-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 in the same amounts as those of<br>
composition (iii).<br>
Subjects enrolled in the study group and subjects in both control<br>
groups were similar with respect to age, body mass-index, and lipid<br>
profile at entry into the study. Safety assessments included the<br>
evaluation of adverse events and vital signs, hematologic tests,<br>
biochemical tests, urine analysis, and physical examination. These<br>
assessments were done at base-line before treatment was started and,<br>
then, at weekly intervals during the treatment period and two weeks<br>
after completion of the study.<br>
1-2 Assay of antioxidant enzymes<br>
Enzyme activities were determined in fresh erythrocytes. After<br>
centrifugation of 1 ml blood, the erythrocytes were washed three times<br>
with isotonic solution and then lysed in bidistilled water (final volume<br>
5 ml). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined according<br>
to Flohe and Otting (Flohe, LM Otting F., Methods Enzymol. 105:93-<br>
104, 1984). Catalase (CAT) activity was determined according to<br>
Pippenger et al [Pippenger, C. E., Browne, R. W., Armstrong, D.,<br>
Regulatory antioxidant enzymes; Methods in Molecular Biology; Free<br>
Radical and Antioxidant Protocols (D. Armstrong, Ed.) vol 108, pp 299-<br>
313, Humana Press, Totowa NJ, 1998.]. Glutathione peroxidase<br>
(GSHPX) activity was determined according to Flohe and Gunzler<br>
(Flohe, L., Gunzler, W. A., Methods Enzymol. 105:114-121, 1984).<br>
Results are expressed as Enzyme Units/mg Hemoglobin.<br>
1.3 Plasma vitamin E. coenzyme Q10 and QH2 measurement<br>
Vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 determinations were performed by the<br>
procedure of Lang et al (Lang, J. K., Gohil, K., Packer, L., Anal.<br>
Biochem. 157:106-116, 1986). Plasma was obtained from freshly drawn<br>
heparinised venous blood by brief centrifugation (800 g for 5 min at<br>
4°C). 1 ml plasma was mixed with 1 ml ethanol containing 0.1 mM<br>
BHT and extracted with 3 ml hexane. The hexane phase was then<br>
evaporated to dryness under nitrogen stream and re-dissolved in<br>
ethanol. 400 ul was filtered onto 0-45 mm filters and then an aliquot of<br>
100 ul was analysed by HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of a Waters<br>
apparatus, equipped with two 510 pumps, a Rheodyne injection valve<br>
with a 100 ml loop, a Symmetry 300 column (C18 reverse phase, 4.6 x<br>
25 cm, 5 mm particle size), thermostated at 27°C with a guard column<br>
(10 mm) of the same material matrix, a Waters 996 Diode array<br>
detector and a Waters 474 spectrofluorometer detector. The two<br>
detectors were set up in line, the column effluent first passing through<br>
the UV detector. The elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min<br>
with a gradient consisting of a mixture of A (80/20 v/v methanol/H2O)<br>
and B (95/5 v/v ethanol/isopropanol). The initial conditions were 39% A<br>
and 61% B. After 16 min the mobile phase was changed linearly over 2<br>
min to 100% B; 100% B continued for 10 min, after which the system<br>
reversed linearly over 2 min to the initial conditions. Peak<br>
identification was performed on the basis of the retention time and of<br>
the absorption spectrum for ubiquinol (Rt = 25.1 min; lmax = 290 nm)<br>
and ubiquinone (Rt = 27.1 min; lmax = 275 nm), and retention time,<br>
absorption spectrum and fluorescence for vitamin E (Rt = 18.2 min;<br>
lmax = 292 nm; lex = 220 nm, lem = 335 nm). Peak quantitation was<br>
performed by automatic peak area integration using a dedicated<br>
software. Results are expressed as nmoles/ml plasma.<br>
1.4 TRAP assay<br>
Total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) was determined<br>
according to Ghiselli et al (Ghiselli, A., Serafini, M., Maiani G., Azzini,<br>
E., Ferro-Luzzi, A., Free Radir.. Biol. Med. 18:29-36, 1995.<br>
1.5 Plasma hydroperoxides quantitation<br>
The assessment of the oxidising capacity in blood serum was carried<br>
out using the D-ROMs kit test produced by DIACRON s.r.l., Italy. The<br>
method is based upon the capacity of transition metals to catalyse the<br>
formation of hydroxyl radicals (-OH) in the presence of hydroperoxides<br>
by Fenton-type reactions. The -OH produced, whose quantity is directly<br>
proportional to the amount of peroxides present in plasma, were<br>
trapped by molecules of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylene diamine, with the<br>
formation of a chromogen with a lmax at 505 nm.<br>
1.6 Lymphocyte isolation<br>
PBMCs were separated from heparinised peripheral blood by<br>
Lymphoprep gradient centrifugation (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway), washed<br>
twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in RPMI<br>
1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) medium supplemented with<br>
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies), 10<br>
IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies), 10 mM HEPES<br>
(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1 mM L-<br>
glutamine (Life Technologies) (complete medium). In the apoptosis<br>
assay, PBMCs (5 x 105/ml) were cultured in complete medium for 12<br>
hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2-huniidified atmosphere. In addition, for the<br>
analysis of mitochondrial functions, aliquots of cells were isolated and<br>
maintained in complete culture medium at 4°C until labeling.<br>
1-7 Expression of surface and intracellular antigens<br>
The absolute counts of cells bearing either the CD4 or the CD8<br>
phenotype were determined by flow cytometry. PBMCs were stained<br>
with the following antibodies: phycoerythrine (PE)-labeled anti-hCD4<br>
or anti-hCD8 (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, BDIS,<br>
San Jose, CA, USA). For staining of surface antigens 5 x 105 PBMCs<br>
were washed in PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma) and 0,1% sodium<br>
azide (PBS-BSA-NaN3) followed by incubation for 20 minutes at 4°C<br>
with the mAbs previously described. For determination of background<br>
staining, cells were incubated with 20 ml of mouse IgGl PE (Becton<br>
Dickinson). Then, after 2 washing with PBS-BSA-NaN3 containing 2%<br>
FCS, the labelled cells were analysed by flow cytometry using a<br>
FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For each sample 10,000<br>
viable lymphocytes were gated, following size (forward scatter, FSC)<br>
and granularity (side scatter, SSC) parameters.<br>
1.8 Staining of apoptotic nuclei with propidium iodide (PD<br>
Lymphocyte apoptosis was quantified as the percentage of cells with<br>
hypodiploid DNA using the technique of Nicoletti et al (Nicoletti, I.;<br>
Migliorati, G.; Pagliacci, C.; Grignani, F.; Riccardi, C., J. Immunol.<br>
Methods 132:271-279, 1968). Briefly, following a short term culture,<br>
cell suspensions were centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes. For staining<br>
of surface antigens, aliquots of 1 x 106 cells were incubated with<br>
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-hCD4 or anti-hCD8<br>
(Becton Dickinson) mAbs as previously described and, after washing,<br>
the pellet was gently re-suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome<br>
solution (50 mg/ml PI in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100™,<br>
0.05 mg/ml RNase A; Sigma). Cells were kept overnight at 4°C, then<br>
analysed in their staining solution on a FACScan flow cytometer<br>
(Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 15mW air-cooled 488 nm argon-ion<br>
laser. Apoptotic nuclei appeared as a broad hypodiploid DNA peak<br>
which was easily discriminable from the narrow peak of nuclei with<br>
normal (diploid) DNA content in the red fluorescence channel. Orange<br>
PI fluorescence was collected after a 585/42 nm band pass filter and<br>
was displayed on a four-decade log scale. Acquisition on the flow<br>
cytometer was done in the low sample flow rate setting (12 (ml/min) to<br>
improve the coefficient of variation on the DNA histograms.<br>
Lymphocytes, including live, early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells,<br>
were gated on the basis of their FSC and SSC parameters, and<br>
fluorescence data were gated on FSC vs. PI fluorescence dual-<br>
parameter contour plots for exclusion of monocytes, debris and clumps.<br>
This method of gating allowed ready discrimination of debris (very low<br>
FSC and decreased PI fluorescence) from dead cells (low FSC and high<br>
PI fluorescence). A minimum of 10,000 events was collected on each<br>
sample.<br>
1.9 Phenotvpic analysis of apnptotic T cells<br>
Quantification and phenotypic analysis of apoptotic cells from the short<br>
term cultured lymphocytes was performed by staining apoptotic cells<br>
with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD; Sigma) as reported by Schmid et<br>
al (Schmid, I., Uittenbogaart, C. H., Keld, B., Giorgi, J. V., J. Immunol.<br>
Methods 170:145-157; 1994). This method was shown to discriminate<br>
between early and late apoptotic cells due to their increased membrane<br>
permeability. Cultured lymphocytes were first incubated with FITC-<br>
conjugated mAbs to surface Ags as described above, and washed cells<br>
were then incubated with 20 fig/ml of 7-AAD for 20 minutes at 4°C<br>
protected from light. Stained cells were further fixed with 1%<br>
paraformaldehyde in PBS in the presence of 20 mg/ml of non-<br>
fluorescent actinomycin D (Sigma) to block 7-AAD staining within<br>
apoptotic cells and avoid non-specific labeling of living cells. Finally,<br>
the double-stained cells were incubated overnight at 4°C in the dark<br>
and were then analysed in their staining solution by a FACScan flow<br>
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The green fluorescence was collected<br>
after a 530/30 BP nm filter, the red fluorescence from 7-AAD was<br>
filtered through a 650 long pass filter. Scattergrams were generated by<br>
combining FSC with 7-AAD fluorescence, and regions were drawn<br>
around clear-cut populations having negative (live cells), dim (early<br>
apoptotic cells), and bright fluorescence (late apoptotic cells). A<br>
minimum of 10,000 events was collected on each sample.<br>
1.10 Analysis nf mitochondria! functions<br>
For the simultaneous assessment of surface markers and ROS<br>
generation, such as superoxide anion and hydroxyperoxides, cells were<br>
first stained with PE-labeled anti-hCD4 or anti-hCD8 antibodies and<br>
then exposed for 15 minutes at 37°C to 2 mmol/1 hydroetbidine (HE;<br>
Molecular Probes) and for 1 hour at 37°C to 5 mM 2",7"-dichloro-<br>
fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes) respectively. In<br>
control experiments, cells were labelled after pre-incubation with the<br>
uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-ehlorophenyZ-hydrazone<br>
(mClCCP; 50 mmol/1, 37°C, 30 minutes; Sigma), or the ROS-generating<br>
agent menadione (1 mmol/1, 37°C, 1 hour, Sigma). For DCFH-DA, a<br>
positive control (cells kept 2 minutes in 15 mM H2O2 and washed three<br>
times) was inserted. Monobromobimane (MBB) (Molecular Probes)<br>
stains glutathione (GSH). In the presence of glutatbione-S-transferase,<br>
MBB combines not enzymaticaily with GSH at low concentrations,<br>
resulting in GSH-speciflc fluorescence. Briefly, T cells were pelleted<br>
and resuspended in 1 ml medium containing 40 mM MBB for 10<br>
minutes at room temperature in the dark, Cells were placed on ice<br>
before analysis performed on a FAGScan cytofluorometer (Becton<br>
Dickinson). FSC and SSC parameters were gated on the major<br>
population of normal-sized lymphoid cells. After suitable<br>
compensation, fluorescence was recorded at different wavelengths:<br>
FITC, DCFH-DA and MBB at 525 nm (FL-1), PE at 575 nm (FL-2) and<br>
HE at 600 nm (FL-3).<br>
2 Statistical analysis<br>
All the results are expressed as the mean values ± standard deviation.<br>
Statistical comparison between groups was made using Student"s t<br>
test, p values
Results<br>
Plasma antioxidant status and peroxide levels<br>
Supplementation with the aforesaid composition (iii) for 21 days<br>
resulted in a significant increase in the total antioxidant status (Table<br>
1). Supportive evidence for this improved antioxidant status was<br>
obtained by measurement of TRAP values and lipid peroxidation<br>
products in blood plasma. A comparable increase in TRAP values was<br>
also observed in the two control groups who were given only some of<br>
the composition components, respectively carnitines in control group A<br>
and selenomethionine, a-tocopherol, a-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 in<br>
control group B. Conversely, plasma peroxide levels were found<br>
significantly lowered at the end of the treatment compared to the base-<br>
line in the composition group and in both control groups to a lower<br>
extent.<br>
Base-line plasma levels for vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and QH2 were 26,<br>
0.50, and 0.66 nmol/ml, respectively, which are comparable to data<br>
reported in the literature. Supplementation with the composition for 3<br>
weeks resulted into an increase in mean plasma levels of alpha-<br>
tocopherol, coenzyme Q10, QH2, and in QH2/(Q10+QH2) ratio (Table 1).<br>
It is of interest that supplementation with the composition resulted in<br>
a 1.5 fold increment of the plasma coenzyme concentration, mainly in<br>
its reduced form.<br>
Activity of antioxidant enzymes in red blood cells<br>
In the treatment group, administration of the composition resulted in a<br>
significant increase in the specific activity of the antioxidant enzyme<br>
GSHPX (p
base-line values (Table 2). A comparable increase in GSHPX activity<br>
was also found in control group B (p
SOD activity was found after supplementation either with the<br>
composition or with some components of the composition. CAT activity<br>
was significantly decreased at the end of the study period in the group<br>
given the composition as compared to base-line (p
towards a reduction in CAT activity was observed also in both control<br>
groups but the difference with values measured before administering<br>
some of the composition components did not reach the statistical<br>
significance.<br>
Lymphocyte apoptosis<br>
Supplementation with the composition was associated with a reduced<br>
susceptibility of lymphocytes to apoptosis. In fact, a lower number of<br>
lymphocytes was undergoing apoptosis in treated patients after 3<br>
weeks of supplementation as compared to base-line. This was<br>
established by staining apoptotic nuclei with PI (see Nicoletti et al,<br>
supra), which detects late events of apoptosis such as chromatin<br>
condensation and DNA fragmentation (Wyllie, A. N., Morris, R. G.;<br>
Smith, A. L.; Dunlop, D., J. Pathol. 142:67-77; 1991. Following 12<br>
hours of incubation in complete medium, the rate of spontaneous<br>
apoptosis was significantly decreased in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes<br>
taken after 3 weeks of treatment as compared with pre-treatment<br>
levels (6.1 ± 2.59 and 6.8 ± 3.03 at base-line, 2.8 ± 1.52 and 3.9 ± 2.09 at<br>
the end of the treatment, respectively for CD4 and CD8 cells; p
for both parameters) (Table 3). Supplementation with carnitines only<br>
had a comparable, and even greater, impact on the frequency of CD4<br>
and CD8 lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis (7.2 + 1.19 and 12.2 + 3.24<br>
at base-line, 3.9 + 1.19 and 5.4 + 1.94 at the end of the treatment,<br>
respectively for CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes; p
GD8 cells). Even subjects who were given selenomethionine, a-<br>
tocopherol, a-lipoic acid, and coenzyme Q10 had a strong decrease in<br>
the frequency of apoptotic lymphocytes compared to pre-treatment<br>
levels (6.7 + 1.58 and 8.6 + 1.91 at base-line, 3.7 + 1.59 and 5.9 + 1.12<br>
at the end of the treatment, respectively for CD4 and CD8 cells, p
for both parameters).<br>
These results were confirmed by measuring apoptosis also with 7-AAD,<br>
a fluorescent DNA-intercalating agent which only penetrates the<br>
membrane of cells undergoing apoptosis and thus exhibit a shrunked<br>
phenotype (reduced FSQ (p
Generation of reactive oxygen species<br>
As shown in Table 4, circulating lymphocytes from the healthy<br>
volunteers enrolled in this study contained a fraction of cells which<br>
were able to oxidise the nonfluorescent lipophilic (i.e., membrane-<br>
permeable) dye HE into the hydrophilic fluorescent product Eth. Since<br>
HE is particulary sensitive to superoxide anion, this change is thought<br>
to reflect the generation of superoxide anion (Rothe, G.; Valet, G., J.<br>
Leukoc. Biol. 47:440-446, 1990). Moreover, lymphocytes were labeled<br>
using DCFH-DA, a fluorochrome that detects hydroperoxide generation<br>
(Rothe et al, supra, and Hockenbery, D. M., Oltvai, Z. N., Yin, X. M.,<br>
Milliman, C. L., Korsmeyer, S. J., Cell 75:241-251, 1993.<br>
Supplementation with the composition was found to be associated with<br>
a strong decrease in the percentage of such cells, which bear an Ethhigh<br>
and DCFH-DA-positive phenotype, as compared to pre-treatment<br>
levels (Table 4). Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant<br>
difference between pre- and post-treatment levels with respect to CD4<br>
and CD8 cells stained with either HE or DCFH-DA (p<g.001 for both></g.001>
parameters).<br>
A significant reduction in the frequency of Ethhigh and DCFH-DA-<br>
positive CD4 and CD8 subset was found also in the control groups A<br>
and B even though the impact of supplementation on those<br>
parameters, although statistically significant, was less striking as<br>
compared to the treatment with the composition (Table 4).<br>
The treatment with the composition was also associated with an<br>
increased frequency of circulating lymphocytes with either CD4 or CD8<br>
surface phenotype that stained positive for glutathioae <gd4:></gd4:>
