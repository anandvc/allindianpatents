GAS BLOWER OF COKE DRY QUENCHING FACILITY AND<br><br>
ITS OPERATING METHOD<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
The present invention relates to a gas blower for a prechamber in a coke dry quenching facility cooling red hot coke produced in a coke oven with inert gas and an operating method of the same.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
In a coke dry quenching facility using an inert gas to cool red hot coke, in recent years, air has been blown into a prechamber (P/C) and burned together with the coke so as to increase the amount of heat in the prechamber and increase the amount of generation of steam in the boiler or the coke discharged from the coke oven in a low temperature is aged to try to improve the coke quality. The problem when blowing air in the prechamber in this way is making the coke temperature uniform in the circumferential direction inside the prechainber.<br><br>
As the above art for making the coke temperature uniform, in the past, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2001-164258, there was the method of blowing in air from a plurality of blowing nozzles provided at the prechamber part and changing the flow rates of air blown in from them in accordance with the temperature distribution and pressure distribution in the circumferential direction so as to make the temperature distribution uniform. Further, as a method for controlling the temperature in the prechamber, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2001158883, the method of blowing water or steam into the prechamber simultaneously while blowing in air has been proposed.<br><br>
However, in the case of a blower such as in the above Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2001—164258,<br><br><br><br><br>
even if reducing the amounts of air blown in at parts where the temperature excessively rises, it is not possible to prevent a biased flow of the gas due to the variation of the particle size distribution in the prechamber. Gas blown in from other directions flowed in and as a result it was difficult to prevent an excessive rise in temperature. Further, as a result of the local temperature, the problems occurred of the bricks in the prechainber being damaged, the ash melting, then redepositing and blocking the gas flues, etc. Further, when simultaneously changing the amounts of blown air in the circumferential direction, the amount of gas passing through the S/F part becomes uneven in the circumferential direction, so the operation of the coke dry quenching facility becomes unstable.<br><br>
Further, as in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2001—158883, there is the method of blowing water or steam into the prechamber at the same time as blowing air. However, in the case of such a method, there was the problem that the water or the steam blown into the prechamber struck the bricks inside the prechamber and damaged the bricks by spalling.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention was made so as to eliminate the above problem and provides a gas blower of a coke dry quenching facility provided with, in the circumferential direction of the inside of a coke dry quenching furnace, a plurality of furnace temperature measurement devices and a branch pipe for branching off part of the low temperature recirculated gas between the blower outlet to the cooling chamber (CC) inlet of the coke dry quenching facility (CDQ) recirculation system, connecting the front end of this branch pipe to a prechamber air blowing nozzle, and making the nozzle shape a double pipe structure in which a part through which air flows and a part through which low temperature gas flows are separated, whereby variations in temperature inside the<br><br><br><br>
prechamber can be eliminated, and an operating method of the same. The gist of the present invention is as follows:<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
Below, the present invention will be explained in detail in accordance with the drawings.<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a gas blower of a coke dry quenching facility according to the present invention. The coke dry quenching furnace 1 for cooling the red hot coke is configured vertically and is provided with a prechamber 2 and a cooling chamber 3 in the vertical direction. The red hot coke is charged from the top of the prechamber 2, gradually moves downward, and is cooled in the cooling chamber 3 by the inert gas blown in from a blowing pipe 19 provided at the bottom of the cooling chamber 3.<br><br>
The inert gas blown in the cooling chamber 3 rises inside the cooling chamber 3 and is exchanged in heat with the red hot coke, whereby the gas rises in<br><br><br><br><br>
temperature and is exhausted to a ring duct 20 at the top of the cooling chamber 3. Further, the inert gas is sent from the ring duct 20 through a primary dust collector 4 to a waste heat boiler 5. At the waste heat boiler 5, the heat is recovered. After the temperature falls to around 1800C, dust is trapped by a secondary dust catcher 6. The gas is then blown through a recirculation blower 7 via a water feed preheater 8, then again blown from the blowing pipe 19 into the cooling chamber 3.<br><br>
On the other hand, air is blown from an air blowing nozzle 17 at the top of the prechamber 2 to the inside of the prechamber 2. The oxygen in the blown in air reacts with the residual volatile matter and part of the fine powder coke and lumps of coke. The reaction is an exothermic reaction mainly producing carbon monoxide. The blown in air and produced gas and the coke rise in temperature and descend inside the prechamber 2. The blown in air and the produced gas are mixed at the bottom of the prechamber 2 with the inert gas rising from the bottom and are exhausted from the ring duct 20.<br><br>
In the above described structure, a plurality of furnace temperature measurement devices 10 are provided in the circumferential direction inside the coke dry quenching furnace 1. The temperatures measured inside the prechamber 2 are sent to the blowing controller 12. The blowing controller 12 controls the temperature inside the prechamber 2 to become a target temperature by an air blowing valve 14 or a low temperature recirculated gas blowing flow rate adjustment valve 15 provided with a branch pipe 9 branching off part of the low temperature recirculated gas and connecting the front end of this branch pipe 9 to the prechamber 2 and the air blowing nozzle 17. For the air blowing valve 14 and low temperature recirculated gas blowing flow rate adjustment valve 15, the blowing adjuster 13 sends a blowing rate signal to the blowing controller 12. Note that reference numeral 11 shows a coke discharge apparatus.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic view of another embodiment of a gas blower of a coke dry quenching facility according to the present invention. In the vertical direction of the coke dry quenching furnace 1 between the prechamber 2 and inlet of the cooling chamber 3, a branch pipe 9 is provided for branching off part of the low temperature recirculated gas. The front end of this branch pipe 9 is connected to the prechamber air blowing nozzle 17. As this prechamber air blowing nozzle 17, the blowing fan 16 is provided. Due to this branch pipe 9, part of the low temperature recirculated gas is supplied to piping of the air blowing nozzle 17 of the prechamber 2.<br><br>
FIG. 3 is a view showing the structure of a gas blower. As shown in this figure, the nozzle shape is made a double pipe structure nozzle 18 where the part through which the air flows and the part through which the low temperature gas flows are separated.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic view showing still another embodiment of a gas blower of a coke dry quenching facility according to the present invention. As shown in this figure, a blowing fan 16 is provided as the prechamber air blower. The front end of the gas branch pipe 9 is connected to the suction side of the blowing fan 16. When the pressure of the low temperature gas becomes insufficient, the blowing fan 16 is used to blow in air and raise the pressure of the low temperature gas.<br><br>
As explained above, the branch pipe 9 provided between the blowing fan 16 to the inlet of the prechamber 2 supplies part of the low temperature recirculated gas to the air blowing nozzle 17 of the prechamber 2. The amount of the supplied recirculated gas is adjusted by a flow rate adjustment valve 15 or other flow rate adjuster provided in each piping. Further, furnace temperature measurement devices 10 provided at a plurality of locations in the radial direction inside the coke dry quenching furnace measure the temperature distribution (T1, T2, ...Tn) inside the coke dry quenching furnace. The<br><br><br><br><br>
variations in the temperature distribution are eliminated or the temperature Tn becomes the control temperature Tmax&gt;Tn by adjusting one or both of the amounts of air blown from the air blowing nozzles 17 or the amount of low temperature gas blown from the branch pipe 9 by feedback control.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is a view showing the cross—section along the line A—A and the cross—section along the line B—B. FIG. 6 is a view schematically showing the particle size distribution of coke in a prechamber. Further, FIG. 7 is an explanatory view of the amount of air blown in a radial direction of a furnace. As shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 7, when adjusting the amount of air blown from the individual air blowing nozzles 17 and the amount of low temperature gas blown from the branch pipe 9, these are blown in from the set nozzles (1, 2...n) . The ratio of the amount of blown air Qa and the amount of low temperature gas Qg (Qa:Qg) is changed to prevent variations in the temperature distribution in the circumferential direction and excessive temperature.<br><br>
Further, the ratio of the amount of blown air Qa from the nozzles and the amount of low temperature gas Qg is changed, but by controlling the total amount of the mixed gas (blown in air + low temperature gas) (Ql, Q2...Qn) to be all constant, it becomes possible to prevent an uneven flow of gas inside the prechamber and stabilize the operation. Here, Qal+Qgl=Ql, Qa2+Qg2=Q2, ...Qan+Qgn=Qn, where Ql=Q2=...Qn.<br><br>
That is, as shown in FIG. 6, if schematically showing the particle size distribution of the coke in the prechamber, the temperature inside the furnace at the region where the particle size of the coke is low and the temperature inside the furnace at the region where the particle size is large is high. Due to this situation. inside the furnace, the temperature differs. Further, due to the particle size of the coke, the pressure of the air<br><br><br>
blown in from the nozzles also differs. Therefore, considering these factors, the ratios of the amount of mixed gas (air + low temperature gas) blown into the prechamber from the nozzles placed in the prechamber with respect to amount of air blown in (Qa) and amount of low temperature gas blown in (Qg) are controlled in accordance with variations in the temperature distribution inside the furnace measured by the furnace temperature measurement devices or a control temperature so that the amounts of air blown in (Qi, Q2...Qn) become Ql=Q2=...Qn.<br><br>
In this way, by controlling the ratios of the amount of mixed gas (air + low temperature gas) blown into the prechamber from the nozzles provided in the prechamber with respect to the amount of air blown in and the amount of low temperature gas blown in according to variations in the temperature distribution inside the furnace measured by the furnace temperature measurement devices or a control temperature, it becomes possible to eliminate temperature variations inside the prechamber and possible to suppress any excessive local temperature rise, so it becomes possible to solve the problem of damage to the bricks or deposition of melted ash and stable operation of the coke dry quenching facility becomes possible. Further, since not water or steam, but its own recirculated gas is utilized, the temperature distribution in the prechamber can be improved without causing extra running costs.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br><br>
As explained above, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to eliminate temperature distribution inside the prechamber and possible to suppress any excessive local temperature rise, so it becomes possib~le to solve the problem of damage to the bricks or deposition of melted ash. Further, by making the amounts of gas blown into the furnace from the plurality of nozzles provided in the prechamber constant<br><br><br>
at all times, the amount of gas flowing inside the furnace in the circumferential direction becomes constant, so stable operation of the coke dry quenching facility becomes possible. Further, since water or steam is not used, damage to the bricks due to spalling is prevented. Since not water or steam, but its own recirculated gas is utilized, the temperature distribution in the prechamber can be improved without causing extra running costs. These and other extremely superior effects are exhibited.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
