				<td>AROMATIC SATURATION AND RING OPENING PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a concurrent or consecutive<br>
process to treat compounds comprising two or more fused aromatic rings<br>
to saturate at least one ring and then cleave the resulting saturated ring<br>
from the aromatic portion of the compound to produce a C2-4 alkane<br>
stream and an aromatic stream. More particularly the process of the<br>
present invention may be integrated with a hydrocarbon (e.g. ethylene)<br>
(steam) cracker so that hydrogen from the cracker may be used to<br>
saturate and cleave the compounds comprising two or more aromatic rings<br>
and the C2-4 alkane stream may be fed to the hydrocarbon cracker.<br>
Additionally, the process of the present invention could also be integrated<br>
with a hydrocarbon cracker (e.g. steam cracker) and an ethylbenzene unit.<br>
Particularly, the present invention may be used to treat the heavy residues<br>
from processing oil sands, tar sands, shale oils or any oil having a high<br>
content of fused ring aromatic compounds to produce a stream suitable for<br>
petrochemical production.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There is a continuing demand for lower paraffins such as C2-4<br>
alkanes for the production of lower olefins which are used in many<br>
industrial applications. In the processing of shale oils, oil sands and tar<br>
sands there is typically a residual stream containing compounds<br>
comprising at least two aromatic rings. These types of compounds have<br>
been subjected to hydrocracking to produce higher alkanes (e.g. C5-8<br>
alkanes) that could be used for example to produce fuels.<br>
United States Patent 6,652,737 issued November 25, 2003 to<br>
Touvellle et al., assigned to ExxonMobil Research and Engineering<br>
Company illustrates one current approach to treating a naphthene feed<br>
(i.e. having a large amount, preferably 75 weight % of alkanes and<br>
cycloparaffin content). The cycloparaffins are subjected to a ring opening<br>
reaction at a tertiary carbon atom. The resulting product contains a stream<br><br>
of light olefins (e.g. ethylene and propylene). The present invention uses a<br>
different approach. The feed comprises a higher amount of unsaturated<br>
and particularly compounds containing two or more fused aromatic rings.<br>
The compounds are partially hydrogenated to have at least one ring which<br>
is saturated and the resulting product is subjected to a ring opening and<br>
cleavage reaction to yield lower (i.e. C2-4) alkanes.<br>
Another approach is illustrated by U.S. Patent 4,956,075 issued<br>
September 11, 1990 to Angevine et al., assigned to Mobil Oil Corporation.<br>
The patent teaches treating gas oil, tar sands or shale oil with an Mn<br>
catalyst on a large size zeolite support to yield a higher alkane stream<br>
suitable for use in gasoline or alkylation processes. The present invention<br>
uses a different catalyst and produces a different product stream.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide a process for treating a feed<br>
containing significant portion (e.g. not less than 20 weight %) of aromatic<br>
compounds containing two or more fused aromatic rings. One ring is first<br>
saturated and then subjected to a ring opening and cleavage reaction to<br>
generate a product stream containing lower (C2-4) alkanes. The resulting<br>
lower alkanes may then be subjected to conventional cracking to yield<br>
olefins. In a preferred embodiment the processes are integrated so that<br>
hydrogen from the steam cracking process may be used in the saturation<br>
and ring opening steps. The process of the present invention will be<br>
particularly useful in treating heavy fractions (e.g. gas oils) from the<br>
recovery of oil from shale oils or tar sands. It is anticipated such fractions<br>
will significantly increase in volume with the increasing processing of these<br>
types of resources.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to provide a process for hydrocracking<br>
a feed comprising not less than 20 weight % of one or more aromatic<br>
compounds containing at least two fused aromatic rings which compounds<br>
are unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-4 alkyl radicals to produce<br>
a product stream comprising not less than 35 weight % of a mixture of C2-4<br>
alkanes comprising concurrently or consecutively:<br><br>
(i)       treating or passing said feed stream in or to a ring saturation<br>
unit at a temperature from 300°C to 500°C and a pressure from 2 to 10<br>
MPa together with from 100 to 300 kg of hydrogen per 1,000 kg of<br>
feedstock over an aromatic hydrogenation catalyst to yield a stream in<br>
which not less than 60 weight % of said one or more aromatic compounds<br>
containing at least two rings which compounds are unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by up to two C1-4 alkyl radicals at least one of the aromatic<br>
rings has been completely saturated;<br>
(ii)      treating or passing the resulting stream in or to a ring<br>
cleavage unit at a temperature from 200°C to 600°C and a pressure from 1<br>
to 12 MPa together with from 50 to 200 kg of hydrogen per 1,000 kg of<br>
said resulting stream over a ring cleavage catalyst; and<br>
(iii)     separating the resulting product into a C2-4 alkanes stream, a<br>
liquid paraffinic stream and an aromatic stream.<br>
The present invention also provides in an integrated process for the<br>
upgrading of an initial hydrocarbon comprising not less than 5, typically not<br>
less than 10 weight % of one or more aromatic compounds containing at<br>
least two fused aromatic rings which compounds are unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by up to two C1-4 alkyl radicals comprising subjecting the<br>
hydrocarbon to several distillation steps to yield an intermediate stream<br>
comprising not less than 20 weight % of one or more aromatic compounds<br>
containing at least two fused aromatic rings which compounds are<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-4 alkyl radicals the<br>
improvement comprising:<br>
(i)       passing said intermediate stream to a ring saturation unit at a<br>
temperature from 300°C to 500°C and a pressure from 2 to 10 MPa<br>
together with from 100 to 300 kg of hydrogen per 1,000 kg of feedstock<br>
over an aromatic hydrogenation catalyst to yield a stream in which not less<br>
than 60 weight % of said one or more aromatic compounds containing at<br>
least two rings which compounds are unsubstituted or substituted by up to<br>
two C1-4 alkyl radicals at least one of the aromatic rings has been<br>
completely saturated;<br><br>
(ii)      passing the resulting stream to a ring cleavage unit at a<br>
temperature from 200°C to 600°C and a pressure from 1 to 12 MPa<br>
together with from 50 to 200 kg of hydrogen per 1,000 kg of said resulting<br>
stream over a ring cleavage catalyst; and<br>
(iii)      separating the resulting product into a C2-4 alkanes stream, a<br>
liquid paraffinic stream and an aromatic stream.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the treatments are done in one<br>
unit and considered concurrent treatment. A draw back of this approach is<br>
that the unit has to run at a lower weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).<br>
Preferably the processes are carried out consecutively in two separate<br>
units which increases the overall WHSV of the process.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the present invention provides<br>
the above process integrated with an olefins cracking process and<br>
optionally an ethylbenzene unit.	ACCOMPANYING<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
There is an increasing use of less conventional sources of<br>
hydrocarbons such as shale oils and tar or oil sands. As a hydrocarbon<br>
source, these materials generally have 5 weight %, typically more than 8<br>
weight %, generally more than 10 weight % but typically not more than<br>
about 15 weight % of aromatic compounds. It is anticipated that within the<br>
next five years the processing of the Athabasca Tar Sands will result in a<br>
significant amount of asphaltenes, residues and products such as vacuum<br>
gas oil etc. (e.g. residues/products containing polyaromatic rings<br><br>
particularly two or more aromatic rings which may be fused). The present<br>
invention seeks to provide a process to treat/hydrocrack these products to<br>
produce lower (C2-4) alkanes (paraffins). The resulting alkanes may be<br>
cracked to olefins and further processed (e.g. polymerized etc.).<br>
Typically the feedstock for use in the ring saturation / ring opening<br>
aspect of the present invention will comprise not less than 20 weight %,<br>
preferably, 40 to 55 weight % of two fused aromatic ring compounds and<br>
from about 5 to 20, preferably from 8 to 14 weight % of aromatic<br>
compounds having three or more fused aromatic rings. The feed may<br>
contain from about 10 to 25 weight %, preferably from 12 to 21 weight %<br>
of one ring aromatic compounds. The aromatic compounds may be<br>
unsubstituted or up to fully substituted, typically substituted by not more<br>
than about four, preferably not more than two substituents selected from<br>
the group consisting of C1-4, preferably C1-2 alkyl radicals. The feedstock<br>
may contain sulphur and nitrogen in small amounts. Typically nitrogen<br>
may be present in the feed in an amount less than 700 ppm, preferably<br>
from about 250 to 500 ppm. Sulphur may be present in the feed in an<br>
amount from 2000 to 7500 ppm, preferably from about 2,000 to 5,000<br>
ppm. Prior to treatment in accordance with the process of the present<br>
invention the feed may be treated to remove sulphur and nitrogen or bring<br>
the levels down to conventional levels for subsequent treatment of a<br>
feedstock.<br>
Depending on the process used the feedstock may be fed to the<br>
first reactor at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) ranging from 0.1 to<br>
1X103 h-1, typically from 0.2 to 2 h-1 for a concurrent or combined process<br>
(carried out in the same reactor) and typically from 1X102 h-1 to 1X103 h-1<br>
for a consecutive process carried out in sequential reactors. (Some<br>
processes refer to a Liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV). The relationship<br>
between LHSV and WSHV is LHSV = WHSV/ stream (average) density).<br>
In the first step of the present invention the feedstock is treated in a<br>
ring saturation unit to saturate (hydrogenate) at least one of the aromatic<br>
rings in the compounds containing two or more fused aromatic rings. In<br><br>
this step typically not less than 60, preferably not less than 75, most<br>
preferably not less than 85 weight % of the polyaromatic compounds have<br>
one aromatic ring fully saturated.<br>
Generally the process is conducted at a temperature from 300°C to<br>
500°C, preferably from 350°C to 450°C and a pressure from 2 to 10,<br>
preferably from 4 to 8 MPa.<br>
The hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a hydrogenation<br>
/ hydrotreating catalyst on a refractory support. Hydrogenation /<br>
hydrotreating catalysts are well known in the art. Generally the catalysts<br>
comprise a mixture of nickel, tungsten (wolfram) and molybdenum on a<br>
refractory support, typically alumina. The metals may be present in an<br>
amount from 0.0001 to 5, preferably from 0.05 to 3, most preferably from 1<br>
to 3 weight % of one or more metals selected from the group consisting of<br>
Ni, W, and Mo based on the total weight of the catalyst (e.g. support and<br>
metal). One, and typically the most common, active form of the catalyst is<br>
the sulphide form so catalyst may typically be deposited as sulphides on<br>
the support. The sulphidizing step could be carried out ex-situ of the<br>
reactor or in-situ before the hydrotreating reaction starts. Suitable<br>
catalysts include Ni, Mo and Ni, W bimetallic catalysts in the above<br>
ranges.<br>
The hydrogenation / hydrotreating catalyst also reduces the sulphur<br>
and nitrogen components (or permits their removal to low levels in the feed<br>
which will be passed to the cleavage process). Generally the<br>
hydrogenation / hydrotreating feed may contain from about 2000 to 7500<br>
ppm of sulphur and from about 200 to 650 ppm of nitrogen. The stream<br>
leaving the hydrogenation / hydrotreating treatment should contain not<br>
more than about 100 ppm of sulphur and not more than about 20 ppm of<br>
nitrogen.<br>
In the aromatic ring saturation (hydrogenation / hydrotreatment)<br>
step hydrogen is fed to the reactor to provide from 100 to 300, preferably<br>
from 100 to 200 kg of hydrogen per 1,000 kg of feedstock.<br><br>
One of the considerations in practicing the present invention is the<br>
stability of the various aromatic ring compounds in the feed. A benzene<br>
ring has a high stability. A lot of energy and relatively narrow conditions<br>
are required for the saturation and cleavage of this aromatic ring in a<br>
single reactor. Hence, under the appropriate conditions this ring can be<br>
saturated and cleaved in a single reactor (e.g. concurrent reactions in one<br>
reactor or a "one step" process). One of the conditions is long residence<br>
time as is shown in examples 1 and 2. At long residence times or low<br>
WHSV benzene and methyl naphthalene may be converted to paraffins in<br>
a one reactor ("one step") process. Additionally the feed needs to be low<br>
in sulphur and nitrogen and relatively narrow in composition (e.g. the same<br>
or substantially the same aromatic compounds). The restrictions relative<br>
to the aromatic compound apply to a continuous flow type process or<br>
reactor. In a batch reactor, different aromatic compounds may be present.<br>
While this may present difficulties the one step process is useful to test<br>
cleavage catalysts. In the examples the catalyst is Pd on a zeolite support<br>
(ZSM-5).<br>
For a fused multiple aromatic ring compound one of the aromatic<br>
rings,is fairly quickly hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated (e.g. the non<br>
shared carbon atoms). In the second part of the process of the present<br>
invention the hydrogenated portion of the ring may then be cleaved. By<br>
cleaving the saturated portion of the ring (4 carbon chain) one gets a short<br>
chain alkyl compound and a single or fused polyaromatic compound with<br>
one less ring. The resulting fused polyaromatic compound may be<br>
recycled through the process. In a further embodiment the process of the<br>
present invention may be integrated with an ethylbenzene unit.<br>
Accordingly, rather than trying to hydrogenate the more stable benzene, it<br>
may be fed in an integrated process to an ethylbenzene unit.<br>
The second part of the fused ring hydrogenation and cleavage<br>
process is a ring cleavage step. The product from the ring saturation step<br>
is subjected to a ring cleavage process to cleave the saturated portion of<br>
the ring. Generally the second step is conducted at a temperature of<br><br>
200°C to 600°C, preferably from 350°C to 500°C and a pressure from 1 to<br>
12 MPa, preferably from 3 to 9 MPa.<br>
In the ring cleavage step hydrogen is fed to the reactor at a rate of<br>
50 to 200 kg, preferably 50 to 150 kg per 1,000 kg of feedstock.<br>
The cleavage reaction takes place in the presence of a catalyst<br>
comprising a metallic component and a support as described below. The<br>
catalyst preferably comprises one or more metals selected from the group<br>
consisting of Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt, Fe, Zn, Ga, In, Mo, W or V.<br>
In the consecutive process (e.g. two step) any of the foregoing catalyst<br>
components could be used for the cleavage reaction.<br>
In the catalyst for the ring cleavage process the metals may be<br>
used in an amount from 0.0001 to 5, preferably from 0.05 to 3, most<br>
preferably from 1 to 3 weight % of the metal based on the total weight of<br>
the catalyst (e.g. support and metal).<br>
The ring cleavage catalyst is typically used on a support selected<br>
from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, silicoaluminophosphates,<br>
gallosilicates and the like.<br>
Preferably, the support for the ring cleavage catalyst is selected<br>
from the group consisting of mordenite, cancrinite, gmelinite, faujasite and<br>
clinoptilolite and synthetic zeolites, the foregoing supports are in their<br>
acidic form (i.e. the acid or acidic component of the ring cleavage catalyst).<br>
The synthetic zeolites have the characteristics of ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-<br>
12, ZSM-23, MCM-22, SAPO-40, Beta, synthetic cancrinite, CIT-1,<br>
synthetic gmelinite, Linde Type L, ZSM-18, synthetic mordenite, SAPO-11,<br>
EU-1, ZSM-57, NU-87, and Theta-1, preferably ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12,<br>
Beta, ZSM-23 and MCM-22. The hydrogenation metal component is<br>
exchanged into the pores or impregnated on the zeolite surface in<br>
amounts indicated above.<br>
A good discussion of zeolites is contained in The Kirk Othmer<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, in the third edition, volume 15,<br>
pages 638-668, and in the fourth edition, volume 16, pages 888-925.<br>
Zeolites are based on a framework of AI04 and Si04 tetrahedra linked<br><br>
together by shared oxygen atoms having the empirical formula M2/nO<br>
AI2O3 y Si02 w H2O in which y is 2 or greater, n is the valence of the cation<br>
M, M is typically an alkali or alkaline earth metal (e.g. Na, K, Ca and Mg),<br>
and w is the water contained in the voids within the zeolite. Structurally<br>
zeolites are based on a crystal unit cell having a smallest unit of structure<br>
of the formula Mx/n[(AI02)x(Si02)y] w H20 in which n is the valence of the<br>
cation M, x and y are the total number of tetrahedra in the unit cell and w is<br>
the water entrained in the zeolite. Generally the ratio y/x may range from<br>
1 to 100. The entrained water (w) may range from about 10 to 275.<br>
Natural zeolites, include mordenite (in the structural unit formula M is Na, x<br>
is 8, y is 40 and w is 24), faujasite (in the structural unit formula M may be<br>
Ca, Mg, Na2, K2, x is 59, y is 133 and w is 235), clinoptilolite (in the<br>
structural unit formula M is Na2, x is 6, y is 30 and w is 24), cancrinite<br>
(Na8(AISi04)6(HC03)2, and gmelinite. Synthetic zeolites generally have<br>
the same unit cell structure except that the cation may in some instances<br>
be replaced by a complex of an alkali metal, typically Na and tetramethyl<br>
ammonium (TMA) or the cation may be a tetrapropylammonium (TPA).<br>
Synthetic zeolites include zeolite A (e.g., in the structural unit formula M is<br>
Na2, x is 12, y is 12 and w is 27), zeolite X (e.g., in the structural unit<br>
formula M is Na2, x is 86, y is 106 and w is 264), zeolite Y (e.g., in the<br>
structural unit formula M is Na2, x is 56, y is 136 and w is 250), zeolite L<br>
(e.g., in the structural unit formula M is K2, x is 9, y is 27 and w is 22), and<br>
zeolite omega (e.g., in the structural unit formula M is Na6.8TMA1-6, x is 8, y<br>
is 28 and w is 21). Preferred zeolites have an intermediate pore size<br>
typically from about 5 to 10 angstroms (having a modified constraint index<br>
of 1 to 14 as described in below). Synthetic zeolites are prepared by gel<br>
process (sodium silicate and alumina) or a clay process (kaolin) which<br>
form a matrix to which a zeolite is added. Some commercially available<br>
synthetic zeolites are described in U.S. Patent 4,851,601. The zeolites<br>
may undergo ion exchange to entrain a catalytic metal or may be made<br>
acidic by ion exchange with ammonium ions and subsequent<br>
deammoniation (see the Kirk Othmer reference above).<br><br>
The modified constraint index is defined in terms of the<br>
hydroisomerization of n-decane over the zeolite. At an isodecane yield of<br>
about 5% the modified constraint index (CI*) is defined as<br>
CI* = yield of 2-methylnonane / yield of 5-methylnonane.<br>
The zeolites useful as supports for the ring cleavage catalyst also<br>
have a spaciousness index (SI) 
hydrocracking of C10 cycloalkanes such as butylcyclohexane over the<br>
zeolite. SI = yield of isobutane/yield of n-butane.<br>
Some useful zeolites include synthetic zeolites having the<br>
characteristics of ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-23 and MCM-22,<br>
preferably ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-23, Beta and MCM-22.<br>
The product stream from the process of the present invention<br>
comprises a hydrocarbon stream typically comprising less than 5,<br>
preferably less than 2 weight % of methane from 30 to 90 weight % of C2-4<br>
hydrocarbons; from 45 to 5 weight % of C5+ hydrocarbons (paraffins) and<br>
from 20 to 0 weight % of mono-aromatic compounds. Depending on how<br>
the processes are conducted (e.g. LHSV or WHSV in the second stage of<br>
the process and support and the metal components of the ring opening<br>
catalyst) the composition of the resulting product stream may be shifted.<br>
At lower LHSV in the second step more of the aromatics are consumed so<br>
that the aromatic component may be reduced to virtually zero and there is<br>
a corresponding increase in the C2-4 components (70 to 90 weight %) and<br>
the C5+ components (10 to 20 weight %). At higher LHSV there is an<br>
increase in the aromatic components (5 to 20 weight %) and a<br>
corresponding decrease in the C2-4 (30 to 45 weight %) and C5+ (40 to 50<br>
weight %) components. One of ordinary skill in the art may vary the<br>
conditions of operation of the process to change the composition of the<br>
product stream depending on factors such as market demand and the<br>
availability of other units for integration of the product stream such as an<br>
ethylbenzene unit, etc.<br>
In further embodiments of the present invention the process may be<br>
integrated with a hydrocarbon cracker for olefins production. The lower<br><br>
alkane stream from the present invention is fed to the cracker to generate<br>
olefins and the hydrogen generated from the cracker is used as the<br>
hydrogen feed for the process of the present invention. In a further<br>
embodiment the present invention may be integrated with either an<br>
ethylbenzene unit or an ethylbenzene unit together with a steam cracker<br>
for olefin production. The aromatic product stream (e.g. benzene) may be<br>
used as feed for the ethylbenzene unit together with ethylene from the<br>
olefin cracker.<br>
The catalyst beds used in the present invention may be fixed or<br>
fluidized beds, preferably fixed. The fluidized beds may be a recirculating<br>
bed which is continuously regenerated.<br>
An integrated oil sand upgrader, aromatic saturation, aromatic<br>
cleavage and hydrocarbon cracker process will be outlined in conjunction<br>
with Figure 3.<br>
The left hand side   of the figure schematically shows an oil sands<br>
upgrader 1 and the right hand side of the Figure 3 schematically shows a<br>
combination of an aromatic saturation unit, a ring cleavage unit and a<br>
hydrocarbon cracker.<br>
Bitumen 3 from the oil sands, generally diluted with a hydrocarbon<br>
diluent to provide for easier handling and transportation, is fed to a<br>
conventional distillation unit 4. The diluent stream 5 is recovered from the<br>
distillation unit and recycled back to the oil sands separation unit or<br>
upgrader (separation of oil from particulates (rocks, sand, grit etc.)). A<br>
naphtha stream 6 from distillation unit 4 is fed to a naphtha hydrotreater<br>
unit 7. Hydrotreated naphtha 8 from naphtha hydrotreater 7 is recovered.<br>
The overhead gas stream 9 is a light gas/light paraffin stream (e.g<br>
methane, ethane, propane, and butane), is fed to hydrocarbon cracker 10.<br>
Diesel stream 11 from the distillation unit 4 is fed to a diesel<br>
hydrotreater unit 12. The diesel stream 13 from the diesel hydrotreater<br>
unit 12 is recovered. The overhead stream 14 is a light gas light paraffin<br>
stream (methane, ethane, propane, and butane) and combined with light<br>
gas light paraffin stream 9 and fed to the hydrocarbon cracker 10. The<br><br>
gas oil stream 15 from distillation unit 4 is fed to a vacuum distillation unit<br>
16. The vacuum gas oil stream 17 from vacuum distillation unit 16 is fed<br>
to a gas oil hydrotreater 18. Light gas stream 19 (methane, ethane, and<br>
propane) from the gas oil hydrotreater is combined with light gas streams<br>
9 and 14 and fed to hydrocarbon cracker 10. The hydrotreated vacuum<br>
gas oil 20 from the vacuum gas oil hydrotreater 18 is fed to a NHC unit<br>
(NOVA Chemicals Heavy oil cracking unit - a catalytic cracker) unit 21.<br>
The bottom stream 22 from the vacuum distillation unit 16 is a<br>
vacuum (heavy) residue and is sent to a delayed coker 23. The delayed<br>
coker produces a number of streams. There is a light gas light paraffin<br>
stream 24 (methane, ethane, propane, and butane) which is combined<br>
with light gas light paraffin streams 9,14, 24 and 19 and sent to<br>
hydrocarbon cracker 10. A naphtha stream 25 sent to naphtha<br>
hydrotreater unit 7 to produce a naphtha stream 8 which is recovered and<br>
a light gas light paraffin stream 9 which is sent to the hydrocarbon cracker<br>
10. Diesel stream 26 is sent to diesel hydrotreater unit 12 to produce<br>
hydrotreated diesel 13 which is recovered and light gas light paraffin<br>

fed to a vacuum gas oil hydrotreater unit 18 resulting in a hydrotreated gas<br>
oil stream 20 which is fed to NHC unit 21. The bottom from the delayed<br>
coker 23 is coke 28.<br>
The NHC unit 21 also produces a bottom stream of coke 28. A<br>
slurry oil stream 29 from the NHC unit 21 is fed back to the delayed coker<br>
23. A light gas or light paraffins (methane, ethane, propane and butane)<br>
stream 30 from NHC unit 21 is fed to hydrocarbon cracker 10. A cycle oil<br>
stream (both heavy cycle oil and light cycle oil) 31 from NHC unit 21 is fed<br>
to an aromatic saturation unit 32 as described above. A gasoline fraction<br>
34 from the NHC unit 21 is recovered separately. A partially hydrogenated<br>
cycle oil (heavy cycle oil and light cycle oil in which at least one ring is<br>
saturated) 33 from the aromatic saturation unit 32 is fed to an aromatic<br>
ring cleavage unit 35. Although not shown in this schematic figure both<br>
aromatic saturation unit 32 and aromatic ring cleavage unit 35 are fed with<br><br>
hydrogen which may be from the hydrocarbon cracker 10. One stream<br>
from the aromatic ring cleavage unit is a gasoline stream 34 that is<br>
combined with the gasoline stream from the NHC (NOVA Heavy Oil<br>
cracker) unit 21. The other stream 36 from the aromatic ring cleavage unit<br>
35 is a paraffinic stream which is fed to hydrocarbon cracker 10.<br>
The hydrocarbon cracker 10 produces a number of streams<br>
including an aromatic stream 37, which may be fed back to the aromatic<br>
saturation unit 32; a hydrogen stream 38, which may be used in the<br>
process of the present invention (e.g. as feed for the aromatic ring<br>
saturation unit 32 and/or the aromatic ring cleavage unit 35); methane<br>
stream 39; ethylene stream 40; propylene stream 41; and a stream of<br>
mixed C4s 42.<br>
As noted above the integrated process could also include an<br>
ethylbenzene unit and a styrene unit. The ethylbenzene unit would use<br>
aromatic streams and ethylene from the cracker and the styrene unit<br>
would use resulting ethylbenzene and generate a stream of styrene and<br>
hydrogen.<br>
The present invention will be illustrated by the following non limiting<br>
examples.<br>
The examples show a process in which methyl naphthalene is first<br>
hydrogenated and then cracked in the presence of a Pd catalyst on a<br>
medium sized zeolite in a single reactor. The difficulty with this process is<br>
that the complete hydrogenation of the fused aromatic rings is very slow<br>
due to adsorptive hindrance. After both rings were saturated the ring<br>
cleavage occurred.<br>
Example 1<br>
The reactor was charged with 500 mg dry catalyst. Before starting<br>
the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in flows of air (16 h, 150 cm3<br>
min-1), nitrogen (1 h, 150 cm3 min-1) and hydrogen (4 h, 240 cm3 min-1) at<br>
300°C to yield a bifunctional catalyst with mpd / A77zeolite,dry = 0.2 %. The<br>
hydrogen carrier gas was loaded with 1-methylnaphthalene (1-M-Np) by<br>
passing it over a fixed bed of an inert solid and glass beads containing the<br><br>
aromatic compound at 80°C (paromatic= 300 Pa). This feed mixture was led<br>
to the reactor holding the activated catalyst at the reaction conditions of<br>
400°C and 6 MPa. Product samples were taken from the reactor effluent<br>
after expansion to ambient pressure. A conversion of 100 % of the two-<br>
ring aromatic compound was achieved. The product yields are shown in<br><br>
The experiment in Example 1 was continued for 167 h. In Figure 1<br>
the conversion of 1-methylnaphthalene at 400°C and 6 MPa is displayed<br>
as a function of time-on-stream. As shown, the catalyst is highly stable<br>
during 167 h on-stream.<br>
Example 2<br>
In this section, the influence of the zeolite pore structure of ZSM-5,<br>
ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-23 and MCM-22 on the conversion of 1-M-Np was<br>
studied. As shown in Table 2, the reaction over the Pd-containing zeolites<br>
leads to the following products: methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-<br>
butane, 2-methylbutane, n-pentane, dimethylbutanes, methylpentanes,<br>
3,3-dimethylpentane and methylcyclohexane.<br><br><br>
On zeolite 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-5 at 400°C and 6.0 MPa, 1-M-Np is<br>
converted with a C2+-n-alkane (i.e., n-alkanes with two and more carbon<br>
atoms) yield of 72 wt.-%. This fraction consists of ethane (13 wt.-%),<br>
propane (41 wt.-%), n-butane (15 wt.-%) and n-pentane (3 wt.-%). Only<br>
slightly lower yields for C2+-n-alkanes (69 wt.-%) are obtained on zeolite<br>
0.2Pd/H-ZSM-11.<br>
However, on zeolite 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-12, the yields to the desired C2+-<br>
n-alkane products are much lower (53 wt.-%). The by-products on zeolite<br><br>
0.2Pd/H-ZSM-5 are the branched alkanes 2-methylpropane (19 wt.-%) and<br>
2-methylbutane (4 wt.-%). On zeolite 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-12, the yield of iso-<br>
alkanes other than iso-butane and iso-pentane is 6 wt.-% (2,2-<br>
dimethylbutane: 1 wt.-%, 2,3-dimethylbutane: 1 wt.-%, 2-methylpentane:<br>
2 wt.-%, and 3-methylpentane: 2 wt.-%). On the zeolite catalysts<br>
0.2Pd/H-ZSM-23 and 0.2Pd/H-MCM-22, a C2+-n-alkane yield of 68 and 69<br>
wt.-% is obtained, respectively: ethane (22 and 25 wt-%), propane (31<br>
and 33 wt.-%), n-butane (13 and 8 wt.-%) and n-pentane (2 and 3 wt.-%).<br>
The by-products on the two zeolites are branched alkanes with a yield of<br>
28 and 24 wt.-%, respectively.<br>
From Table 2 ZSM-5, ZSM-11 and ZSM-12 supported catalysts<br>
tend to produce more propane and higher paraffins. ZSM-23 and MCM-22<br>
supported catalyst produce higher amounts of ethane which may be a<br>
better stream for ethane type crackers.<br>
Example 3<br>
The influence of the total pressure (ptotal) on the catalytic<br>
performance of zeolite 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-11 was studied at T= 400°C and<br>
WHSV= 0.003 h-1. The conversion and the product distribution are given<br>
in Figure 2. The conversion of 1-methylnaphthalene is between 99 and 93<br>
% in the pressure range studied. Increasing the pressure from 2.0 to 6.0<br>
MPa caused a decrease in the yield of the desired products from 73 to 61<br>
wt.-%. The yield of ethane decreased from 9 to 5 wt.-%, the yield of<br>
propane from 46 to 39 wt.-% and the yield of n-butane from 18 to 17 wt-<br>
%. Furthermore, the YiSo-butane / Yn-butane-ratio changed from 0.7 to 1.0. The<br>
formation of the iso-alkanes is obviously preferred at higher total<br>
pressures.<br>
Example 4<br>
The ring saturation and ring opening process of the present<br>
invention - (Aromatic Ring Cleavage - ARORINCLE) comprises of two<br>
steps: in the first step the total feed - Gas Oil (GO), is hydrotreated. In<br>
this step the catalyst poisons sulfur and nitrogen are removed and<br>
aromatics are saturated to naphthenics. This step is there mostly to<br><br>
protect the second step metal catalyst, typically noble metal, from the<br>
catalyst poisons. The liquid product from the first step is separated from<br>
the gas stream (methane), and this liquid product is used as feed for the<br>
second step, in which the naphthenic and aromatic rings are opened to<br>
form valuable light paraffins (C2 to C4).<br>
The experimental runs in the laboratory were carried out in a fixed<br>
bed-reactor in the up flow mode. Because this unit contains only one<br>
reactor, all the runs were done in such a way that the first step is carried<br>
out. Thereafter, another catalyst was reloaded for the second step<br>
reaction to take place. The catalyst used for the first step is a stacked<br>
catalyst bed: the first catalyst bed is a NiW/AI2O3 catalyst and the second<br>
is a NiMo/Al203 catalyst. Both are commercially available catalysts. The<br>
catalysts were sulfided in-situ prior to the start of run per standard<br>
procedure.<br>
After the sulfiding is completed, the catalyst bed is heated up to the<br>
desired reaction temperature at a heating rate of 30°C per hour and the<br>
Gas Oil (GO) is introduced into the reactor.<br>
The liquid product from the reactor is separated from the gas in the<br>
gas separator, collected in the glass container and kept in the laboratory<br>
fridge. After the sufficient amount of hydrotreated GO is collected the<br>
liquid product is bubbled through with the nitrogen to separate the rest of<br>
the trapped H2S from the liquid product. The collected and gas free GO is<br>
then introduced into the reactor, which is loaded with the Pd/Zeolite<br>
catalyst. Before starting this second step reaction, the catalyst was initially<br>
pretreated in flows of air (16 h, 150 cm3 min"1), nitrogen (1 h, 150 cm3 min-<br>
1) and hydrogen (4 h, 240 cm3 min"1) at 300°C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The following examples show 2 cases of the ARORINCLE process<br>
carried out at different conditions. The feed for these runs was Gas Oil<br>
derived from oil sands with a boiling point range of 190°C and 548°C,<br>
which was pre-hydrotreated to reduce the content of heteroatoms. The<br>
difference between Example 4A and 4B is that in 4B, the LHSV for the<br>
second stage reaction was reduced (from 0.5 to 0.2 h-1), resulting in higher<br><br>
paraffins (C2 to C4) and saturates yield. The process can be adjusted for<br>
high paraffins plus saturates yield with low BTX yields or vice versa, as<br>
desired, depending on market needs.<br><br><br><br>
Based on the results in Table 4A a computer simulation of the<br>
ARORINCLE process was carried out for the conditions set out in Table<br>
4A. For a feed of 1 metric ton (e.g. 1,000 kg) of gas oil and 120 kg of H2<br>
there would be separated in the liquid separator 7.84 kg of methane, 35.17<br><br>
kg of C2-4 products (e.g. separately recovered), H2S and NH3. The liquid<br>
separator would contain (1000 +120 - (7.84 + 35.17)) = 1076.89 kg of<br>
liquid feed (saturates and aromatics). This would be fed to the second<br>
reactor together with 75 kg of H2 and the resulting product stream would<br>
comprise 7.92 kg of H2; 372.86 kg of C2-4 products, 545.97 kg of<br>
C5+(paraffins) and 221.21 kg of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX).<br>
Based on the results in table 4B a computer simulation of the<br>
ARORINCLE process was carried out for the conditions set out in table<br>
4B. For a feed of 1 metric ton (e.g. 1,000 kg) of gas oil and 120 kg of H2<br>
there would be separated in the liquid separator 7.84 kg of methane, 35.17<br>
kg of C2-4 products (e.g. separately recovered), H2S and NH3. The liquid<br>
separator would contain (1000 +120 - (7.84 + 35.17)) = 1076.89 kg of<br>
liquid feed (saturates and aromatics). This would be fed to the second<br>
reactor together with 100 kg of H2 and the resulting product stream would<br>
comprise 16.54 kg of H2; 443.61 kg of C2-4 products 650.76 kg of<br>
C5+(paraffins) and 62.05 kg of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX).<br>
