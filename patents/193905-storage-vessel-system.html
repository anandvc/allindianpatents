OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The primary object of the invention is to construct a storage vessel system which is very effective in preserving the product.<br>
It Is another object of the Invention Is to construct a storage vessel system which has bw capital investment and low working cost<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION :<br>
A storage vessel system comprising an external drum having a perforated cover and snuggly fitted lid, and an inner drum, the said inner drum being adapted to hold a storage pot; the said ceramic storage pot; having a ceramic cover housing inside the inner drum and nests over it on Its rim, a water pump and pipe connection for circulation of water within the system, an exhaust fan fitted with top cover of the outer vessel drawing air contained Inside and throwing It to open atmosphere the system being such that the clay pot being porous, the heat is drawn from the product is started and the temperature is thereby reduced and maintained at a fairly low level. The said storage pot is the subject of copending application no. 1290/MAS/96.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION :<br>
The storage vessel system according to this Invention Includes the storage vessel alongwith the storage pot which contains the product that needs to be stored. Though the description Includes the storage pot as part of the Invention, the storage pot Is subject of application no. 1290/M/AS/96.<br>
The storage vessel system comprises an external drum(4), made out of 18 SWG Galvanised M.S Sheet of sl2se 750 mm dia, 900 mm long, with provision for cold water lntet(5). A perforated lid (3) having central top(l) portion fits tightly to this drum at Its top end. An exhaust Fan (2) is fitted on to central top. Concentric to the external drum(4), an inner drum(7) made out of Galvanised Iron Sheet of size 450 mm dia x 525 mm long Is suspended using tie supports(9). This Inner drum (7) has provision for water Inlet(lO) at one end and an outlet pipe(ll) is brazed at 180 (degree) apart to this inlet port which extends approximately 75 mm from the outer surface of the external drum(4). The joints between the outlet pipe and the drums are brazed to have a leak tight arrangement The outer drum has pair of a handles (6) riveted to It A storage pot /vessel(8), made out of clay, with a clay cover Is housed Inside the Inner drum(7) and rests over It on Its rim(13). An annular clearance (14) of about 15 mm between the Inner drum(7) and the storage pot/vessel(8) Is maintained for free flow of cold circulating water. A water pump (Monobloc) of 0.25 HP rating Is used for forced circulation of cooling water and flow Is regulated by using gate valve (12) In its delivery pipe line.<br><br>
The product to be stored is kept inside the safd storage pot (8) and the perforated lid (15) of the storage pot is closed. The top lid (3) and the cover top (1) of storage vessel ane fitted In position and water pipe connections from pump to the inlet and from outlet to the sump are completed. When the pump is energized, the cold water flows through the Inlet port (5) Into the external drum filing the annular space between the concentric drum and when the level reaches the Inlet port (10) of the Inner drum, the water flows Inside the Inner drum and get filled between the annular cavity of Inner drum and storage pot When the level raises and reach the outlet port (11) opening, the excess water flows out and falls Into the sump. A continuous flow of cooling water is thus established as long as the pump is on.<br>
Meanwhile, the exhaust fen on the top cover of storage vessel is energized which draws the air contained Inside the system which Is almost saturated with water vapour above the water level and throws it out to the open atmosphere. Fresh air enters inside the vessel through the pores provided in the top lid and hence the pressure balance and the air current Is malntalned Inside the system. Due to this air current; the rate of evaporation Is Increased and the latent heat Is drawn from the storage day vessel. Storage pot being a day vessel is porous, and thereby the heat Is drawn from the product stored and the temperature is reduced and maintained at a fairly low level.<br>
We have thus achieved as per the Invention a eco-friendly Storage vessel system which Is double layered drum, capable of holding a storage pot within,<br><br>
having air exhaust system and water cooling system to maintain and control the humidity of air and the temperature control of the product that Is to be stored In the storage pot, comprising of :-<br>
-	an external drum of Galvanised M, S sheet with cylindrical shape;<br>
-	an inner drum also cylindrical In shape and concentric to said external drum, made of Galvanised iron, is suspended Inside the said external drum by means of tie support;<br>
-	a lld which is perforated plate with a central top portion, fitted onto the external drum as a lid;<br>
-	two handles reverted on two sides of external drum for handling purposes;<br>
-	the said external drum having an water irlet port at one end and connected to a pump;<br>
-	the said inner drum having water Inlet port at one end and an outlet port at 1800 degrees apart extending substantially beyond the outer surface of the extemal drum into an outlet plpe and thereafter the outlet pipe connected to a sump;<br>
-	the said inner drum having a rim adapted to hold a storage pot within its interior and with an annular gap of atleast 15 mm to ensure free air flow between the pot and Inner drum.<br>
-	the said top cover of the said lid of said extemal drum is connected to electric exhaust fan to ensure humidity control;<br><br>
-	wherein the said inlet pipe of extsernal drum allows the cold water<br>
when the pump Is energized to enter and collect in the annular space<br>
between the external drum and Inner drum until the water reaches the<br>
Inlet port level of Inner drum;<br>
-	wherein the said Inlet port of Inner drum then allows the water from<br>
the annular cavity between the drums to enter and collect Into the<br>
annular cavity between the inner drum and storage pot until the water<br>
reaches the outlet port level of the Inner drum;<br>
	wherein the said inlet port of inner drum allows the excess watar from<br>
the annular cavity between Inner drum and storage pot to flow out<br>
through the outlet pipe onto the sump from where the water Is<br>
recirculated vide the said pump to Inlet port of the external drum, thus<br>
ensuring a continuous flow of cooling water to the two drums as long<br>
as the pump is on;<br>
	the said exhaust fan on top cover when energized draws out the air<br>
from the interior portion of the two drums which is saturated with<br>
water vapour, thereby allowing fresh air to enter the Interior portion of<br>
the arums through the pores provided on the said lid of said external<br>
drum, and thereby Increasing the rate of evaporation<br><br><br>
Now the Invention will be described. In detail, with reference to drawings accompanying this specification, wherein<br>
