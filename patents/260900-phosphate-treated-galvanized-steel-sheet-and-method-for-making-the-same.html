				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PHOSPHATE-TREATED GALVANIZED STEEL SHEET AND METHOD FOR<br>
MAKING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a surface-treated<br>
steel sheet used mainly for building and home appliance<br>
applications, and specifically to a phosphate-treated<br>
galvanized steel sheet suitable as a steel substrate to be<br>
coated, and a method for making the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Galvanized steel sheets coated with zinc or zinc alloys<br>
are used in areas requiring corrosion resistance for<br>
building and home appliance applications. Such galvanized<br>
steel sheet is rarely used as it is. In usual cases, a<br>
coating is applied onto the galvanized layer of the sheet.<br>
Further, before the application of a coating, the sheet is<br>
usually subjected to chemical treatment such as phosphate<br>
treatment or chromate treatment.<br>
The phosphate treatment is carried out by contacting an<br>
acidic solution containing phosphate ions with a galvanized<br>
steel sheet to allow them to react, thereby forming a<br>
crystalline film composed mainly of zinc phosphate on the<br>
coating surface. The phosphate treatment improves coating<br><br>
adhesion, whereby primary coating properties stable to<br>
various coatings are made available. Therefore, galvanized<br>
steel sheets treated with phosphate are widely used as steel<br>
substrates to be coated for building and home appliance<br>
applications. Further, in recent years, in order to improve<br>
the corrosion resistance of phosphate films, techniques for<br>
forming a zinc phosphate film containing Mg have been<br>
disclosed in many patent documents.<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2002-285346 discloses a zinc phosphate-<br>
treated galvanized steel sheet with excellent corrosion<br>
resistance and color tone, the steel sheet having a zinc<br>
phosphate film containing 2.0% or more of Mg and 0.01 to 1%<br>
of at least one element selected from Ni, Co, and. Cu at a<br>
coating weight of 0.7 g/m2 or more.<br>
However, under the technique, the zinc phosphate film<br>
contains a large amount of Mg, so that the surface of the<br>
steel sheet coated with the phosphate film may be discolored<br>
black, or blackened when exposed to high temperatures and<br>
humidity. There is another problem that the color tone of<br>
the zinc phosphate film is dark because the film contains Ni,<br>
Co, and/or Cu at high concentrations.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2680618 discloses a technique for<br>
preventing the formation of spots of phosphate crystals<br>
through the treatment of a galvanized steel or an aluminum-<br><br>
zinc coated steel sheet with a magnesium zinc phosphate-<br>
based aqueous solution containing 0.4 to 2.0 g/L of Zn, 0.4<br>
to 5.0 g/L of Mg, and 0.05 to 2.0 g/L of Ni, and 8.0 to 20.0<br>
g/L of P2O5, wherein the ratio of the free acid content to<br>
the total acid content (free acidity/total acidity) in the<br>
solution is from 0.02 to 0.15.<br>
Under the technique, in order to densely form phosphate<br>
crystals, the treatment requires a relatively long period of<br>
time of 20 seconds to 10 minutes. When the treatment is<br>
followed by aftertreatment such as electroplating, the above<br>
treatment time is preferably as short as possible from the<br>
viewpoint of production efficiency, but phosphate crystals<br>
tend to be incompletely formed with a short treatment such<br>
as several seconds, which may result in local vacancies of<br>
phosphate crystals.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2770860 discloses a technique for<br>
quickly forming a phosphate film with a white color tone<br>
through the treatment with a phosphate aqueous solution<br>
containing 0.5 to 5.0 g/L of Zn, 0.3 to 3.0 g/L of Mg, and<br>
3.0 to 20.0 g/L of P2O5, wherein the ratio of the free acid<br>
content to the total acid content (free acidity/total<br>
acidity) in the solution is from 0.1 to 0.4.<br>
Under the technique, the free acid concentration is<br>
increased thereby enhancing the etching effect on zinc in a<br>
galvanized steel sheet. However, continuous treatment of a<br><br>
steel sheet tends to result in development of streaks,<br>
depending on the surface state of the galvanized steel sheet.<br>
This is' likely due to the fact that the difference between<br>
the levels of local reactivity of the zinc surface layer<br>
becomes obvious through the treatment with a high etching<br>
effect, which results in the development of macroscopic<br>
flaws.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
making a phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet which<br>
allows the quick formation of a uniform phosphate film, and<br>
a phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet having excellent<br>
corrosion resistance and blackening resistance made by the<br>
method.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An aspect of the present invention is a method for<br>
making a phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet, including<br>
forming a phosphate film on the surface of a galvanized<br>
layer of a galvanized steel sheet using a phosphate<br>
treatment solution containing Zn2+ and Mg2+ so as to satisfy<br>
2.0 

0.10.<br>
In the making method, the phosphate film is preferably<br>
formed by contacting the galvanized layer surface: with the<br>
phosphate treatment solution for 3 to 15 seconds.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a phosphate-<br>
treated galvanized steel sheet made by any of the above<br>
making methods, the galvanized steel sheet having thereon a<br>
phosphate film containing Mg in an amount of 0.2 
by mass at a coating weight of 0.2 to 3.0 g/m .<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method<br>
for making a phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet<br>
including treating a galvanized steel sheet with a phosphate<br>
treatment solution to form a phosphate film on the surface<br>
of the galvanized steel sheet, wherein the phosphate<br>
treatment solution contains Zn2+ in an amount of more than<br>
2.0 g/L and 5.0 g/L or less, Mg2+ in an amount of from 2.0 to<br>
5.0 g/L, the concentration ratio of the Mg2+ to Zn2+<br>
(Mg2+/Zn2+) is from 0.4 to 2.5, and the ratio of the free<br>
acidity to the total acidity in the treatment solution is<br>
0.020 or more and less than 0.10.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
As a result of dedicated research to solve the above<br>
problems, the inventors have found that a uniform phosphate<br>
film is quickly formed on a galvanized steel sheet through<br>
the use of a phosphate treatment solution containing a zinc<br>
ion and a magnesium ion, wherein the zinc ion level, the<br>
magnesium ion level, and the concentration ratio of the<br>
magnesium ion to the zinc ion are within specific ranges,<br>
and the ratio of the free acidity to the total acidity is<br><br>
optimum. They have also found that the resultant phosphate-<br>
treated galvanized steel sheet has excellent corrosion<br>
resistance and blackening resistance. The present invention<br>
has been accomplished on the basis of the findings.<br>
The structure of the present invention and the reason<br>
for the numerical limitation of each essential feature are<br>
described below.<br>
The phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet obtained<br>
by the method of the present invention is composed of a<br>
galvanized steel sheet having thereon a phosphate film<br>
containing 0.2% or more and less than 2.0% by mass of Mg, at<br>
a coating weight of 0.2 to 3.0 g/m2.<br>
(Galvanization)<br>
The galvanized steel sheet as the steel substrate for<br>
the steel sheet of the present invention may be any<br>
galvanized steel sheet, for example, a hot dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet, an electrogalvanized steel sheet, a<br>
galvannealed steel sheet, an aluminum-zinc alloy-coated<br>
steel sheet (for example, a molten zinc-55% by mass aluminum<br>
alloy-coated steel sheet, or a molten zinc-5% by mass<br>
aluminum alloy-coated steel sheet), an iron-zinc alloy-<br>
coated steel sheet, a nickel-zinc alloy-coated steel sheet,<br>
or a nickel-zinc alloy-coated steel sheet after blackening<br>
treatment. The steel sheet as the substrate is not<br>
particularly limited as long as it is suitable for use as a<br><br>
galvanized steel sheet, and may be appropriately selected<br>
according to the intended use. The coating weight of the<br>
galvanized layer may be appropriately selected according to<br>
the intended use, and is preferably from 1 to 100 g/m2. When<br>
the coating weight is 1 g/m2 or more, sufficient corrosion<br>
resistance is achieved. However, a coating weight of more<br>
than 100 g/m2 is wasteful, in terms of cost. The coating<br>
weight is more preferably from 5 to 7 0 g/m2.<br>
(Phosphate film)<br>
The galvanized steel sheet has on at least one side<br>
thereof a phosphate film containing 0.2% by mass or more and<br>
less than 2.0% by mass of Mg, at a coating weight of 0.2 to<br>
3.0 g/m2.<br>
The phosphate film is formed mainly for improving the<br>
adhesion between the galvanized layer and coating, and more<br>
preferably improves corrosion resistance as well as the<br>
adhesion. The Mg content of the phosphate film is<br>
preferably 0.2% by mass or more and less than 2.0% by mass.<br>
When the content is 0.2% by mass or more, sufficient<br>
corrosion resistance is achieved, and when the content is<br>
less than 2.0% by mass, excellent blackening resistance is<br>
achieved. The Mg content is more preferably from 0.. 5 to<br>
1.0% by mass. The phosphate film may contain unavoidable<br>
impurities such as Ni, Mn, and Co within a range of 0.01 to<br>
0.4% by mass.<br><br>
The coating weight of the phosphate film is preferably<br>
from 0.2 to 3.0 g/m2. When the coating weight is 0.2 g/m2 or<br>
more, sufficient corrosion resistance is achieved, and when<br>
the coating weight is 3.0 g/m2 or less, coarsening of the<br>
phosphate crystals in the phosphate film is rather inhibited,<br>
which results in the improvement of the coating adhesion.<br>
The phosphate film is formed by contacting the surface<br>
of the galvanized layer with the below-described phosphate<br>
treatment solution. The contact method is not particularly<br>
limited, and may be an ordinary method such as spraying or<br>
immersion.<br>
The treatment time with the phosphate treatment<br>
solution is preferably from 3 to 15 seconds. When the<br>
treatment time is 3 seconds or more, the phosphate film is<br>
readily formed, and when the treatment time is 15 seconds or<br>
less, etching by the phosphate treatment solution is rather<br>
inhibited, which facilitates the formation of a rr.ore uniform<br>
phosphate film.<br>
Before the formation of the phosphate film, it is<br>
preferable that the galvanized layer be subjected to surface<br>
conditioning treatment using a colloidal titanium active<br>
treatment agent. Examples of the colloidal titanium active<br>
treatment agent include "PREPALENE ZN" manufactured by Nihon<br>
Parkerizing Co., Ltd. The surface conditioning treatment<br>
may be carried out by spraying the treatment agent on the<br><br>
surface of the galvanized layer.<br>
The method of the present invention for making a<br>
phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet includes forming a<br>
phosphate film on the surface of a galvanized layer of a<br>
galvanized steel sheet using a phosphate treatment solution<br>
containing Zn2+ and Mg2+ so as to satisfy 2.0 
2.0 
satisfying 0.020 
present description, the liter unit is expressed as "L".<br>
2.0 
Zn2+ is an essential component for forming phosphate<br>
crystals, so that the Zn2+ concentration in the phosphate<br>
treatment solution must be more than 2.0 g/L and 5.0 g/L or<br>
less, and is more preferably from 3.0 to 5.0 g/L. If the<br>
concentration is 2.0 g/L or less, the phosphate<br>
insufficiently deposits, which results in the formation of a<br>
nonuniform phosphate film locally devoid of phosphate<br>
crystals, and if more than 5.0 g/L, the phosphate crystals<br>
are coarsened, which results in the failure to achieve<br>
sufficient corrosion resistance of the phosphate film.<br>
2.0 
Mg2+ is an essential component for improving the<br>
corrosion resistance of the phosphate film, so that the Mg2+<br>
concentration in the phosphate treatment solution must be<br>
from 2.0 to 5.0 g/L, and is more preferably from 2.5 to 5.0<br><br>
g/L. If the concentration is less than 2.0 g/L, inclusion<br>
of the magnesium component is so low that the corrosion<br>
resistance of the zinc phosphate film deteriorates, and if<br>
more than 5.0 g/L, the content of the magnesium components<br>
is so high that the blackening resistance of the zinc<br>
phosphate film deteriorates. The Mg2+ concentration varies<br>
depending on the concentration ratio of Mg2+ to Zn2+<br>
(Mg2+/Zn2+) in the below-described phosphate aqueous solution,<br>
so that the Mg2+ concentration must be adjusted within an<br>
appropriate range of Mg2+/Zn2+.<br>
0.4 
In order to form a phosphate film containing an<br>
appropriate amount of Mg, in the present invention, the<br>
concentration ratio of the magnesium ion to the zinc ion in<br>
the phosphate treatment solution (Mg2+/Zn2+) is defined as<br>
from 0.4 to 2.5, and more preferably from 0.8 to 1.2. If<br>
Mg2+/Zn2+ is less than 0.4, the Mg2+ concentration in the<br>
treatment solution is less than 2.0 g/L, so that Zn is<br>
preferentially taken into the phosphate film of the product,<br>
which results in a decrease of the ratio of Mg to Zn that<br>
deteriorates the corrosion resistance of the zinc phosphate<br>
film. On the other hand, if Mg2+/Zn2+ is more than 2.5, the<br>
Mg2+ concentration in the treatment solution is more than 5.0<br>
g/L, the ratio of Mg to Zn in the phosphate film of the<br>
product is out of the appropriate range, and the blackening<br><br>
resistance of the zinc phosphate film deteriorates.<br>
In addition to the above-described conditions, the<br>
phosphate treatment solution preferably has a temperature of<br>
from 30 to 70°C, and a pH of from 1.0 to 2.5. The reasons<br>
for these ranges are as follows.<br>
Firstly, under the conditions, the Mg salt readily<br>
dissolves in the phosphate treatment solution, which<br>
facilitates optimization of the Mg2+ concentration in the<br>
solution.<br>
Secondly, the phosphate treatment solution is more<br>
reactive at a liquid temperature of 30°C or higher, which<br>
facilitates quick formation of a uniform film. In addition,<br>
when the liquid temperature is 70°C or lower, etching is<br>
rather inhibited and the phosphate readily deposits, which<br>
markedly facilitates the control of the treatment time.<br>
Further, when the pH is 1.0 or more, etching rarely occurs<br>
and the film readily deposits, which facilitates the control<br>
of the treatment time as described above. In addition, when<br>
the pH is 2.5 or less, the treatment solution is stable.<br>
The inventors also studied the selection of the anion<br>
countering Mg2+ in the treatment solution. The anion is<br>
preferably a nitrate ion. The anion may be a hydroxide ion,<br>
a carbonate ion, or a sulfate ion, but Mg salts of these<br>
ions have rather inferior solubility. When a chloride ion<br>
is used as the anion, the Mg salt has sufficient solubility,<br><br>
but chlorine ions may be included in the phosphate treatment<br>
solution concurrently with Mg2+ to cause a deleterious effect.<br>
On the other hand, a nitrate ion has an oxidative effect and<br>
is less likely to remain in the film components than other<br>
anions, and thus further improves the performance of the<br>
phosphate film. Accordingly, the anion is preferably a<br>
nitrate ion, and the Mg ion source in the treatment solution<br>
is preferably magnesium nitrate. The phosphate treatment<br>
solution used in the present invention is preferably a<br>
commercial treatment solution containing a zinc ion, a<br>
phosphate ion, and other additives such as a promoter, and<br>
examples of the treatment solution include "PB3312M" (trade<br>
name) manufactured by Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. mixed<br>
with a specified amount of the nitrate ion.<br>
0.020 
The phosphate film is formed as follows: the pH at the<br>
solid-liquid interface of the treatment solution is<br>
increased by the etching action of the free orthophosphoric<br>
acid (free acid) in the treatment solution on the. plated<br>
surface, and the concentration equilibrium between zinc<br>
dihydrogenphosphate (Zn(H2P04)2) and orthophosphoric acid<br>
(H3PO4) in the treatment solution changes, so that the zinc<br>
dihydrogenphosphate deposits as zinc phosphate crystals<br>
containing magnesium. Accordingly, in the formation of the<br>
phosphate film, the free acid plays a very important role.<br><br>
Accordingly, the inventors focused attention on the etching<br>
action of the free acid, and eagerly studied a method for<br>
forming a uniform phosphate film through short treatment<br>
(about 3 to 15 seconds).<br>
As a result of this, they have found that (i) the<br>
increase of the free acid concentration enhances the etching<br>
effect on zinc plating, and the surface state becomes<br>
nonuniform by the degreasing and surface conditioning<br>
processes conducted as pretreatment before the phosphate<br>
treatment, so that an uneven phosphate film is formed, and<br>
that (ii) the increase of the free acid concentration<br>
hinders the deposition of zinc phosphate crystals, so that<br>
no phosphate film is formed in some areas with short<br>
treatment, for several seconds. As a result of further<br>
research, they have also found that the optimization of the<br>
ratio of the free acidity to the total acidity in a lower<br>
range than in the prior art allows the deposition of<br>
phosphate crystals on the same level as in the prior art<br>
while controlling the etching effect, whereby a uniform<br>
phosphate film is quickly formed.<br>
The free acid (orthophosphoric acid) concentration is<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 3.4 in terms of free acidity, and<br>
more preferably from 1.0 to 3.0. The total acidity is<br>
preferably from 20 to 26, which must include the described<br>
free acidity.<br><br>
The ratio of the free acidity to the total acidity<br>
(free acidity/total acidity) must be 0.020 or more and less<br>
than 0.10, and is more preferably from 0.035 to 0.096. If<br>
the ratio is less than 0.020, the free acid concentration is<br>
so low that the etching effect on zinc is poor, and reaction<br>
necessary for deposition of phosphate crystals is rather<br>
hindered, which results in the failure to form a sufficient<br>
phosphate film. In addition, stability of the phosphate<br>
treatment solution deteriorates, and zinc and solids, which<br>
are likely phosphate compounds containing iron occurring as<br>
an impurity, deposit and disperse in the treatment solution.<br>
On the other hand, if the concentration is 0.10 or more,<br>
after short treatment for few seconds, the phosphate film<br>
may have flaws due to the nonuniform surface state of zinc.<br>
The term free acidity is determined as follows: several<br>
drops of bromophenol blue as an indicator are added to 10 ml<br>
of the phosphate treatment solution, the treatment solution<br>
is titrated with 0.1 N caustic soda, and the amount of 0.1 N<br>
caustic soda (ml) used for the neutralization is expressed<br>
as an absolute number. In the same manner, the total<br>
acidity is determined as follows: several drops of<br>
phenolphthalein as the indicator are added to 10 ml of the<br>
phosphate treatment solution, the treatment solution is<br>
titrated with 0.1 N caustic soda, and the amount of 0.1 N<br>
caustic soda (ml) used for the neutralization is expressed<br><br>
as an absolute number.<br>
The above-described embodiment is only an example of<br>
the embodiments of the present invention, and various<br>
modifications thereof may be made.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples of the present invention are described below.<br>
(EXAMPLES 1 to 16 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 9)<br>
A cold rolled steel sheet having a thickness of 1.0 mm<br>
was subjected to, as pretreatment, electrolytic degreasing<br>
for 30 seconds at a current density of 5A/dm2 in an alkali<br>
degreasing liquid (liquid temperature: 70°C) containing<br>
sodium orthosilicate (60 g/L), with stainless steel as the<br>
counter electrode. The steel sheet was washed with water,<br>
immersed in a 30 g/L sulfuric acid aqueous solution (liquid<br>
temperature: 30°C) for 5 seconds for pickling, and then<br>
washed with water. The pretreated steel sheet was subjected<br>
to electrogalvanizing treatment thereby forming a galvanized<br>
layer on one side of the steel sheet at a coating weight of<br>
20 g/m2. For the electrogalvanizing treatment, a galvanizing<br>
bath filled with a zinc plating solution containing 440 g/L<br>
of zinc sulfate heptahydrate was used. The pH of the zinc<br>
plating solution was adjusted to 11.5 with sulfuric acid.<br>
The temperature of the galvanizing bath was 50°C. In the<br>
electrogalvanizing bath, the counter electrode was iridium<br><br>
oxide-coated Ti plate electrode, which was disposed in<br>
parallel with the test plate at a distance of 10 mm. A<br>
current was passed at a current density of 70A/dm2 with the<br>
plating solution circulated between the electrodes at a flow<br>
rate of 1.5 m/s.<br>
As described above, a galvanized layer was formed on<br>
the steel sheet surface, washed with water, and then<br>
subjected to phosphate treatment.<br>
As pretreatment before the phosphate treatment, the<br>
galvanized layer surface was treated with a surface<br>
conditioner (trade name "PREPALENE Z", manufactured by Nihon<br>
Parkerizing Co., Ltd.). The galvanized layer was then<br>
sprayed with a phosphate treatment solution (a mixture of<br>
"PB3312M" manufactured by Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. and<br>
magnesium nitrate) with the spraying time varied as<br>
appropriate, washed with water, and dried to form a<br>
phosphate film. The phosphate treatment solution had a<br>
temperature of 60°C, and a pH of 2.1 to 2.7, which differed<br>
among examples and comparative examples. All the treatment<br>
solutions contained Ni in an amount of 0.1 to 0.4 g/L.<br>
The Zn2+ concentration, Mg2+ concentration, and free<br>
acidity and total acidity in the phosphate treatment<br>
solution were varied as follows. The free acidity and total<br>
acidity in the examples and comparative examples were varied<br>
by controlling the concentration of "PB3312M" and adding as<br><br>
necessary a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution,<br>
orthophosphoric acid, and nitric acid. The Zn2+<br>
concentration was varied by changing the initial<br>
concentration of "PB3312M", and the Mg2+ concentration was<br>
varied by changing the content of magnesium nitrate.<br>
The Mg content of the phosphate film was measured by<br>
dissolving the phosphate treated layer with an ammonium<br>
dichromate aqueous solution, and analyzing the solution by<br>
ICP (inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission<br>
spectrometry). The phosphate film coating weight was varied<br>
by changing the period of contact with the phosphate<br>
treatment solution. The phosphate film coating weight was<br>
measured by a gravimetric method using a solution of the<br>
film dissolved with an ammonium dichromate aqueous solution.<br>
Table 1 lists the Zn2+ concentration, Mg2+ concentration,<br>
Mg2+/Zn2+ ratio, free acidity, total acidity, and free<br>
acidity/total acidity ratio in the phosphate treatment<br>
solution in each of the examples and comparative examples,<br>
and the Mg content and coating weight of the phosphate film<br>
on each of the phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheets.<br>
The phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheets obtained<br>
as described above were subjected to various tests.. The<br>
criteria for the tests conducted in the examples are<br>
described below.<br>
(1) Appearance uniformity<br><br>
The surface appearance after the phosphate treatment<br>
was visually observed, and the uniformity after the<br>
phosphate treatment was evaluated on the basis of the<br>
following criteria:<br>
O: uniform appearance<br>
x: nonuniform appearance<br>
(2)	Crystallization condition<br>
Crystallization condition was evaluated on the basis of<br>
the presence or absence of local vacancies of phosphate<br>
crystals in the phosphate film observed with SEM. Randomly<br>
chosen ten areas (100 µm x 100 µm) in the central visual<br>
field on the 150 x 70 mm2 specimen excluding the fringe areas<br>
of 20 mm from the edge of the specimen were observed with an<br>
electron microscope at a magnification of 1000, and the<br>
number of points having no phosphate crystal with a diameter<br>
of 20 µm was counted in each area. The average number of<br>
the points having no phosphate crystal counted in the ten<br>
areas was evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:<br>
O: less than 3<br>
A: 3 or more and less than 10<br>
x: 10 or more<br>
(3)	Corrosion resistance<br>
Corrosion resistance was evaluated as follows: a<br>
specimen (size: 100 x 50 mm) was cut out from each of the<br>
phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheets made above, and<br><br>
the edges and back side of the specimen were sealed with<br>
tape, and then subjected to the salt spray test according to<br>
JIS Z 2371-2000. The top surface of the specimen was<br>
periodically observed, and the time until the ratio of the<br>
white rust area became 5% with reference to the total<br>
measuring area on the specimen (white rust formation time)<br>
was measured, and evaluated on the basis of the following<br>
criteria:<br>
©: 24 hours or more<br>
O: 8 hours or more and less than 24 hours<br>
A: 4 hours or more and less than 8 hours<br>
x: less than 4 hours<br>
(4) Blackening resistance<br>
Blackening resistance was evaluated as follows: a<br>
specimen (size: 100 x 50 mm) was cut out from each of the<br>
phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheets made above, and<br>
the initial L value (lightness) of the specimen was measured<br>
using a spectroscopic color-difference meter SQ2000<br>
(manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.).<br>
Subsequently, the specimen was allowed to stand for 24 hours<br>
in a constant temperature and humidity bath at a temperature<br>
of 80°C and a relative humidity of 95%. After standing, the<br>
L value of the specimen was measured in the same manner, and<br>
the amount of change AL from the initial L value (L value<br>
after standing - initial L value) was calculated and<br><br>
evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:<br><br>
(5) Coating adhesion<br>
Coating adhesion was evaluated as follows: a specimen<br>
(70 x 150 mm) was coated with an alkyd melamine-based paint<br>
(DELICON #700 manufactured by Dai Nippon Toryo Co., Ltd.,<br>
dried at 130°C for 30 minutes, film thickness: 28 ± 5 |am)<br>
without pretreatment such as degreasing, incised with a<br>
cutter to make cross cuts (10 x 10 grid at intervals of 1<br>
mm), and then subjected to Erichsen extrusion at a height of<br>
5 mm. A piece of cellophane adhesive tape (type C LP-18)<br>
manufactured by Nichiban Co., Ltd. was affixed to the<br>
crosscut area after the Erichsen extrusion, and tightly<br>
contacted thereon using a spatula. Thereafter, the tape was<br>
removed, and the coating residual rate was measured and<br>
evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:<br><br>
Table 1 shows the results of the evaluation results in<br>
the above tests.<br>
These results indicate that the phosphate-treated<br><br>
galvanized steel sheets of Examples 1 to 16 had favorable<br>
appearance uniformity, crystallization condition, corrosion<br>
resistance, blackening resistance, and coating adhesion, and<br>
that the quickly formed phosphate films also had sufficient<br>
performance.<br><br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the making method of the present invention,<br>
a uniform phosphate film is quickly formed, and thus a<br>
phosphate-treated galvanized steel sheet superior to known<br>
anticorrosive coated steel materials in corrosion resistance<br>
and blackening resistance is obtained. The phosphate-<br>
treated galvanized steel sheet is widely useful as a steel<br>
substrate to be coated for building and home appliance<br>
applications, and thus markedly contributes to the industry.<br><br>
