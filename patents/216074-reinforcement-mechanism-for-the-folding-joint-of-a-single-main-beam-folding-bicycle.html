				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a reinforcement mechanism for the folding<br>
joint of a single-main-beam folding bicycle.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A folding bicycle is equipped with a folding joint at the center of its<br>
main beam, by the folding joint, the main beam of the bicycle can be<br>
folded in two by 180Â°. A folding bicycle can either have single main<br>
beam or double main beams. A double-main-beam folding bicycle is<br>
equipped with folding joints on both main beams, so that, when the<br>
bicycle is in its open mode, the strength and the rigidity of the whole<br>
bicycle can be ensured. But on the other hand, the rotation axes of the two<br>
folding joints of the two main beams should be completely co-linear,<br>
which demands a very high machining precision. In addition, when the<br>
bicycle is being folded or opened, the user should operate two folding<br>
joints, which is inconvenient for use. A single-main-beam bicycle is<br>
simple in structure, and convenient for use, but when the user is riding the<br>
bicycle, a relatively larger stress is applied to the folding joint, and the<br>
rigidity is relatively poor, even if the main beam is made of large tubes<br>
with thicker walls.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
The aim of this invention is to provide a reinforcement mechanism<br>
for the folding joint of a single-main-beam folding bicycle, so as to<br>
further enhance the rigidity of the single-main-beam folding bicycle.<br>
According to the present invention, a reinforcement mechanism is<br>
provided for the folding joint of a single-main-beam folding bicycle, both<br>
ends of the main beam, which is joined together with a folding joint near<br>
its center, are connected to the seat tube and the head tube respectively;<br>
the reinforcement mechanism which is foldable during the course of<br>
folding/unfolding actions of the main beam and in the form of a rod<br>
installed between the main beam and the seat tube; when the bicycle is in<br>
its open mode, the seat tube, the main beam and the reinforcement rod<br>
constitute a triangle together, and the folding joint is located on the main<br>
beam within the triangle.<br>
According to the present invention, a reinforcement rod, which<br>
participates in folding/unfolding actions of the main beam is added<br>
between the main beam and the seat tube; the main beam, the seat tube<br>
and the reinforcement rod constitute a stable triangle together. Therefore,<br>
when the bicycle is being ridden, the reinforcement rod can bear part of<br>
the stress, the forces applied to the main beam are reduced, and<br>
consequently, the forces applied to the folding joint are reduced. Thus, the<br>
strength of the folding joint is ensured, the rigidity of the<br>
single-main-beam bicycle is enhanced, and in the meantime, the<br><br>
advantage of convenient operation of the single-main-beam bicycle with<br>
one folding joint is maintained.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Embodiment 1:<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the main beam 18 which is joined together<br>
with a folding joint 2 near its center intersects with and is connected to<br>
the seat tube 19. A foldable reinforcement rod 1 is installed between the<br><br>
main beam 18 and the seat tube 19. The reinforcement rod 1, the seat tube<br>
19 and the main beam 18 constitute a triangle together, and the folding<br>
joint 2 is located within the triangle. The reinforcement rod 1 is divided<br>
into two segments 5, 6, which are connected to the seat tube 19 and the<br>
main beam 18 respectively, and the free ends of the two reinforcement<br>
segments 5, 6 are engageable concave and convex structure respectively.<br>
The two reinforcement segments 5, 6 are connected to the main beam 18<br>
and the seat tube 19 respectively at an angle by which the concave and<br>
convex structure of the free ends of the reinforcement segments will be<br>
engaging with each other exactly when the main beam 18 is in its open<br>
mode. The reinforcement rod 1 is installed above the main beam 18,<br>
where the two reinforcement segments 5, 6 are in contact with each other<br>
closely under pressure, and bear part of the stress, therefore, the forces<br>
applied to the main beam 18 are reduced. The reinforcement rod 1 will<br>
not affect the folding/unfolding actions of the main beam 18.<br>
Embodiment 2:<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the reinforcement rod 1 is connected to the main<br>
beam 18 by hinge, the other end of the reinforcement rod 1 has a hook 20,<br>
while a protruding pin 23 is secured on the seat tube 19. When the bicycle<br>
is in its open mode, the hook 20 of the reinforcement rod 1 can be hanged<br>
to the pin 23, by doing so, the main beam 18, seat tube 19 and the<br><br>
reinforcement rod 1 constitute a triangle. When the bicycle is folded, the<br>
folding of the main beam will not be affected if you release the<br>
reinforcement rod 1 from the pin 23, and put it in parallel with the main<br>
beam 18. Other technical features are the same as those of embodiment 1.<br>
Embodiment 3:<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a fixing stand 14 is installed on the main beam 18,<br>
the reinforcement mechanism 1 is in the form of a unstretchable member<br>
and divided into at least two segments, one segment 15 of which is<br>
secured to the seat tube or the bottom bracket on the seat tube 19, while<br>
one end of another reinforcement segment 16 passes through the fixing<br>
stand 14 and connected by screw with the adjusting nut 17, and the two<br>
reinforcement segments 15, 16 are connected with each other by rings<br>
and buckles. When the bicycle is in its open mode, the reinforcement<br>
mechanism 1, the main beam 18 and the seat tube 19 constitute a triangle,<br>
the reinforcement mechanism 1 is below the main beam 18, by operating<br>
the adjusting nut 17, the ring-and-buckle connection between the two<br>
reinforcement segments 15, 16 is strained, the reinforcement mechanism<br>
1 will bear part of the stress, and the forces applied to the main beam 18<br>
are reduced. When the bicycle is in its folded mode, the two<br>
reinforcement segments 15, 16 are connected with one another by rings<br>
and buckles, the reinforcement mechanism 1 can be curved, so that, the<br>
folding of the main beam 18 will not be affected. Other technical features<br><br>
are the same as those of embodiment 1.<br><br>
