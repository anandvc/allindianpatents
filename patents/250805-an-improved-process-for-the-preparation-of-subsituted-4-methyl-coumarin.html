				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of substituted 4-methyi coumarin of general formula (I), wherein R is Me and R1 is selected from the group consisting of OH, COCH3, NH2 and CH3.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarin (Coumarin 47 or Coumarin 460) and 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (Umbelliferon-47).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Of the large number of naturally occurring flavour compounds coumarin is one of the most widely distributed in the Plant kingdom. The coumarin and its derivatives are interesting from the point of view of their chemical constitution, a group of lactones derived from o-hydroxy cinnamic acid.<br>
In the class of coumarins, 4-methyl coumarins have enjoyed a special status as they form the care of industrially important coumarins like coumarin 47 or coumarin 460 on umbelliferon-47. The synthesis of coumarins and their derivatives has attended considerable attention from organic and medicinal chemists for many years as a large number of natural products contain this heterocyclic nucleus. They are widely used as additives in food, perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and in the preparation of insecticides, optical bright-energy and dispersed fluorescent and laser dyes. The synthesis of 4-methyl coumarin derivatives have been mainly reported via the Pachmans condensation using various catalysts.<br>
Reference may be made to A. Russell. J. R. Frve. Org. Synth.. 1941. 21, 22, wherein von Pechmann reaction leads to various substituted coumarin derivatives. Classically, the process consists of the condensation of phenols with ß-keto esters in the presence of a variety of reagents and gives good yields of 4-substituted coumarins. Several acid catalysts have been used in the von Pechmann  reaction  including  sulfuric  acid,  aluminium  chloride,  phosphorus<br>
pentoxide and trifluoroacetic acid. However, these catalysts have to be used in excess; for example, sulphuric acid in ten to twelve equivalent (H. von Pechmann. C. Duisberq. Chem. Ber. 1884. 17. 929). in fluoroacetic acid in three to four equivalents. (L. L. Woodes: J. Sapp. J. Org. Chem.. 1962. 27. 3703) and phosphorous pentoxide is required in a five fold excess (A. Robertson, W. F. Sandrock; C. B. Henry. J. Chem. Soc. 1931. 2426). Moreover, in some cases, mixtures of substituted phenols, j3-keto esters and the acidic catalyst were allowed to stand overnight or for a number of days or were heated above 150°C and undesired side products such as chromones in addition to coumarins were obtained. As a result, the disposal of excess acid waste leads to environmental pollution.<br>
Another reference may be made to B. M. Trost. F. D. Toste. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1996. 118. 6305. wherein Trost and Toste reported a expensive Pd(0)-catalysed addition of phenols to alkynates in formic acid giving coumarins. In their reaction however, a Pd(0) species acts as the actual catalyst. The formic acid plays the important role in the catalytic cycle.<br>
Still another reference may be made to S. Hesse and G. Kirsch. Tetrahedron Lett.. 2002. 43.1213. wherein a rapid access to coumarin derivatives using Vilsmeier-Haack and Suzuki Cross-coupling reactions is described.<br>
Another reference may be made to I. Yavari. R. Hekmat-Shoar and A. Zonouzi. Tetrahedron Lett.. 1998. 39. 2391. a direct and operationally convenient approach to the synthesis of 4-carboxymethyl coumarins based on aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction between the conjugate base of substituted phenols and a vinyltriphenyl phosphonium salt was presented. Thus, reaction of phenols with dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate (DMAD) in presence of triphenylphosphine leads to the corresponding 4-carboxymethyl coumarins.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Still another reference may be made to US Patent 1.920.494 (August 1. 1933). wherein Raschig found that, chloro compounds of o-cresol, when reacted with anhydrous sodium acetate gives coumarin. Processes based on chlorinated o-cresol esters have been used to a considerable extent in the commercial production of coumarin because of inexpensive starting materials such as the phosphate and carbamate. Fusion of 11dichioro-o-cresyl carbonate with potassium acetate at 150-200 °C yielded 71% of coumarin.<br>
In another reference U S Patent. 2.062.364 (December 1. 1936). G Kretchmer and C Collaud. C. A. 31 : p 711a. it was disclosed that alkali acetate in the fusion reaction could be replaced by acetic anhydride in the presence of metal catalysts, preferably 1% cobalt oxide, in which case acetyl chloride is formed and is recovered, yield of coumarin, 45%.<br>
Still another reference may be made to U S Patent. 3.859.311 (January. 1975) and 3.936.473 (February 3. 1976) that disclosed a method for producing coumarinis vinylation of phenol with methyl acrylate in acedic medium and in the presence of air. After 6 hrs, 51% coumarin and methyl-o-coumarate were produced in a condensation favouring ortho over para condensation in a ratio of 2,4:1.0. The p-coumarate, also formed, does not yield coumarin but the methyl-o-coumarate is converted into coumarin by continulusly passing it through a reaction zone at 200-350 °C. (Scheme-1).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
still another reference may be, made to A. J. Hoefnaqel. E. A. Gunneweqh. R. S. Downing and H. van Bekkum. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun.. 1995. 225. wherein for 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarium which is useful as a starting material for the preparation of an insecticide (Hymeeromone) is obtained in good yields by applying zeolite H beta of Amberlyst-15.<br>
Another reference may be, made to Y. V. Subba Rao. S. J. Kerlkarni. M. Subrahmanvam and A. V. Rana Res. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun.. 1993. 1456. wherein the formation of 4-methyl coumarin by cycloaddition of phenol with acetic anhydride over CeNaY zeolite has been described.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to S. Frere. V. thierv and T. Berson. Tetrahedron Lett.. 2001. 42. 2791. a synthesis of 7-amino coumarins was performed via the Peckmann reaction by microwave irradiation of the reactions on solid support (graphite/montmorillonite K10). In this convenient methodology the strong thermal effect due to graphite/microwave irradiation is associated with the acetic catalyst role of this clay. (Scheme-2).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The present invention involves a reaction that was carried out by heating ethylacetoacetate and substituted phenol in the presence of 10-mol% of iodine at 80°C. After completion, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water, containing sodium thiosulphate and the products were separated by filtration. The crude product was purified by re-crystallization from hot ethanol to afford pure coumarin derivative of formula 3 (Scheme-3).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of effective molecular iodine as a catalyst in a catalytical process for the preparation of high yield of substituted 4-methyl coumarin.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of substituted 4-methyl coumarin of the general formula (I), wherein R is Me and R1 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OCH3, NH2, COCH3 and CH3, which comprises<br>
