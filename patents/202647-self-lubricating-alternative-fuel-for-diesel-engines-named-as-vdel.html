				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>In these days of advanced technology and science there are many fuels for internal combustion engines such as Petrol, Diesel, Propane, B100, etc. There are also some mixed fuels such as Power Alcohol, B20, etc. Generally we need such a type of fuel which is cheap, powerful, fast-igniting, low pollutant, less explosive etc. But none of the fuels mentioned above i.e. which are commonly used has all the above properties. As for example, Diesel creates a lot of CO2, CO, toxic Carbon particles, NOx gases etc. Petrol, power alcohol, Propane &amp; B100 are high cost fuels and contain comparatively low energy. B100 creates a lot of NOx gases. So, if we want to get such a fuel that is cheaper than diesel, fast-igniting than diesel, produces low pollution, powerful like diesel and not explosive like Petrol, also it can be used in diesel engines with out any modification of the engine, then we are to use VDel, the fuel for the modern days demand. This fuel is a homogeneous mixture of a chemical (Kerosene) &amp; a bio-fat (Mustard oil) in a specific ratio. Kerosene (Paraffin) + Mustard oil (Bio-fat) VDel (Mechanical Energy) This fuel VDel has been invented by us for the first time and also the fuel has effectively been experimented by us on diesel vehicle engines / pump engines for the first time. And we are the pioneer in this field. The fuel, VDel is of high energy level as good as diesel, cheaper than diesel, self lubricating, easy to produce, low pollutant, non-toxic, fast-igniting and non-explosive. Industrially this fuel can be produced at large scale by the process that we have also designed (drawing attached with complete specification). The significance of our invention is that we have found out the synergistic effect that arises when two such types of oil (Kerosene &amp; Mustard oil), those are totally unfit for use as fuel in diesel engine, are mixed in a particular ratio and thus produce a very efficient fuel for diesel engine.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to a self lubricating alternative fuel for dfesel engine: BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Diesel is an excellent fuel for both light and heavy engines. But there are some problems with diesel. It creates lot of CO2 CO, Carbon particle etc. In 2001 Mark Z Jacobson from Stanford University reveled that diesel vehicles emit about 18% more carbon per gallon than do petrol vehicles. He predicted that there would be greater global warming with diesel than with petrol over the next 100 to 150 years. A research from "international Agency for Research on cancer" has designated diesel particles as potential to probable human carcinogen. These elemental carbon particles absorb toxic organic material and are so tiny that can penetrate not only our lungs but also our skin. Though it is a cheaper fuel, now a days diesel is no longer so cheap due to continuous sharp increase in price of crude oil in international market and many governments like Government of India have removed direct subsidy on diesel. Moreover, though diesel has self lubricating quality, the quality of lubrication that diesel produces is not high and diesel engines need extra lubricant for safety of the engines. So there is a need for a better alternative fuel for diesel vehicles.<br>
Petrol or Gasoline needs mobile as lubricant. Diesel is to some extent self-lubricating, but the quality of lubrication is not very high. So Diesel needs lubricant for the safety of the engine (combustion chamber). But the presently invented fuel (VDel) creates very fine lubricant at the time of burning. It has high level of energy and balanced lubricating quality. So if we use the fuel of present invention then we need not pay for lubricant separately.<br><br>
Diesel &amp; B100 need TANK HEATER or AGITATOR in colder weather (when outdoor temperatures drop below 1O°F these fuels start to become thick and their ability to flow can be affected). But the fuel of the present invention does not need this type of equipment. Ordinary diesei gives lot of starting problem in winter season, but while using VDei no such problem does arise.<br>
This fuel of the present invention (VDei) does not produce any toxic substance during and after full burning. But all the fuels those are used now a days are highly pollutant. As for example -<br>
Diesei produces lot of Carbon particles, CO2, CO, &amp; also produces lot of NOx, SO2 etc. poisonous gases. Several International organizations including International Agency for Research on Cancer' have designated diesei particles as potential to probable human carcinogen. These elemental carbon particles absorb toxic organic material and are so tiny that can penetrate not only our kings but also our skin.<br>
Petrol produces lot of poisonous gases such as NOx, SO2, etc.<br>
B100 reduces the amount of CO2 emissions by more than 75% over petrol,<br>
diesei, but NOx emissions are an exception to the rule, since Biodisel tends to<br>
increase these emissions.<br>
The main components that VDei produces after burning are:-<br>
Carbon-di-oxide (CO2), Water vapour (H2O) etc.(at the time of full burning)<br>
Carbon-mono-oxkie ( CO ), Carbon particles, and aforesaid components (at the<br>
time of improper burning).The bio-chemical component of VDei reduces the<br>
amount of CO2 than diesei. The crops used to produce VDei absorbs large<br>
amount of CO2 as they grow. VDells non-toxic and partly biodegradable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a self lubricating alternative fuel for diesel engine.<br>
Another object of this invention is to prepare a fuel which is cheaper than diesel.<br>
Further object of this invention is to prepare a fuel which is less pollutant and does not produce any toxic substance.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to prepare a fuel which is less volatile and is not explosive in nature.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a self lubricating alternative fuel for diesel engine comprising kerosene and biofat.<br>
According to this invention there is also provided a process of preparing the self<br>
lubricating alternative fuel thereby<br>
Preparing a homogeneous mixture of kerosene &amp; biofat with an external Impulse.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a self lubricating fuel having kerosene &amp; a biofat.<br>
VDel is a homogeneous mixture of KEROSENE and MUSTARD OIL (liquid vegetable fat). If we give heat then it produces white coloured gas which is very easily combustible. MUSTARD OIL and KEROSENE do not make homogeneous<br>
mixture with out imposition of any external Impulse. But there is no need to use any emulsifying agent to prepare VDel.<br>
Energy content of two components :-<br>
KEROSENE : 132,000 Btu. / Gallon. MUSTARD OIL : 156,000 Btu. / Gallon.<br>
The proportion of two com portents:-<br>
VDel for diesel engine requires volume ratio of two components<br>
as Kerosene : Mustard oil * 85:15 * 17:3<br>
Thus the energy level of VDel comes to 135600 Btu./ GaBon.<br>
The components thus taken are mixed with the help of external impulse vtz. Jerk / stirring so as to make a homogeneous mixture. For industrial / commercial production at large scale, machinery for doing the job will be required. (Accompanying Fig. 1)<br>
According to the Accompanying Fig.- 1, three underground tanks are there one each for Kerosene, Mustard oH, and VDel. Raw materials are stored In first two tanks and there from those are pumped to the Mixing Machine at the speckled rate. The mixing machine mixes the components into a homogeneous liquid termed as VDel which in tern is stored in the storage tank. Delivery of the fuel is done by the pump.<br>
The Kerosene as mentioned is the combination of different hydrocarbons as obtained from partial distillation of crude petroleum at the temperature ranging from 150°C to300°C.<br><br>
Kerosene only is not a suitable futl to be used in diesel engines and it has been observed that some sort of difficulties such as -<br>
(a) the engine suffers from lack of lubrication which in tern damages the<br>
engine, as kerosene has very little lubricating quality, (b) rate of emission of carbon particles and soot becomes high, Similarly Mustard oil alone cani be used as fuel in diesel engines, since it is not sufficiently ignitable and hence wastage of fuel is there due to incomplete burning. It is also very difficult to start the engine with Mustard oil as fuel.<br>
Surprisingly, when Kerosene and Mustard oil are mixed together with jerk / stirring a homogeneous mixture is produced and a unique, ideal &amp; very efficient fuel for diesel engines is produced due to the synergistic effect of the components. It gives fine lubrication to the engine at the time of burning and emission of carbon particles, soot reduces remarkably. Also complete burning of fuel takes place and it gives comfort to start the engine. But the most Important factor associated with this synergistic effect is the particular ratio (Kerosene : Mustard oil ¦ 17 : 3 ) at which these two components are mixed. With the increase in the quantity of Mustard oil above 15% the problem In starting the angina and disruption in proper burning increase. On the contrary, with the decrease in the quantity of Mustard oil below 15% the energy level of fuel and the lubrication of angina decrease rapidly. The most interesting point is that with the increase in mustard oil above 15% the energy level of the fuel diminishes practically, though it must increase mathematically. This is due to improper / partial burning of the fuel.<br>
The key point behind this invention lies with determining the proper ratio to utilize the optimum level of synergistic effect of two oils (those can not be used separately as fuel for diesel engine) to give birth to an ideal, effective and efficient fuel for diesel engine.<br><br>
The bio-fat used in VDel is used in natural form and is free from any chemical treatment that can change its chemical structure.<br>
VDel can also be produced with the help of other bio-fats instead of Mustard oil. But in this matter it is important that we have to use such type of bio-fats those follow aH the key procedures used in case of Mustard oil and creates the same kind of synergistlc effect. It is quite natural that the quality of different bio-fats is different. So to achieve the same kind of synergistic affect ami the same kind of properties the ratios in which each of the bio-fats is to be mixed with Kerosene will naturally be different. We find some of the blo-fats which can be used in VOel as one of Ms component in stead of Mustard oil. These bio-fats are Soyabean oil, Sunflower oil, Rapeseed oil, Rice bran oil, Palm oH, cocoanut oH and OHve oft. Each of these oils can be mixed separately with Kerosene with out any emulsifying agent. Each of these oils Is mixed separately with Kerosene with the help of little external impulse viz. jerk / stirring so as to make a homogeneous mixture. As per our observation the determined ratios are as follows:-<br>
Kerosene: Soyabean oN = 84% : 16% - 21 :4<br>
Kerosene: Sunflower oil =- 86% : 15% = 17 :9 Kerosene: Rapeseed oil = 82% : 18% = 41: 9 Kerosene : Rice bran oH = 82% : 18% = 41: 9 Kerosene : Olive oil =* 80% : 20% -4:1<br>
Kerosene: Cocoanut oil - 76% : 25% -9:1 Kerosene : Palm oH = 80% : 20% * 4 :1<br><br>
The fuel VDel produced in combination with Kerosene and one of the aforesaid bio-fats that may be used as a component in stead of Mustard oil possesses similar types of qualities as that of VDel, produced with the help of Mustard oil. The qualities are mentioned below-<br>
(1) Manufacturing procedure is similar. Each of these oils can be mixed with Kerosene with out any emulsifying agent. Each of these oils is mixed with Kerosene with the help of little external impulse viz. jerk / stirring so as to make a homogeneous mixture. But the ratio of the components is variable depending upon the bio-fat used.<br>
(2) in all the cases no modification / change in engine is required. Also no attachment will be necessary while using the fuels in diesei engines.<br>
(3) In all the cases the fuels have good and proper self-lubricating quality. So there is no requirement for lubricant to be used separately.<br>
(4) All the fuels produce less quantity of CO2, CO, carbon particles in comparison to diesei. While biodiesel emits higher quantity of NOx gases, these fuels emit negligible quantity of NOx gases in comparison.<br>
(5) No risk such as burning, explosion, etc. is involved in case of manufacturing of these fuels. Also there is no hazard in handling, touching and smelling the fuels.<br>
The fuel VDel is not at all explosive one. It is not so volatile and its boiling temperature ranges from 150°C to 300°C at 1 atmospheric pressure, it does not catch fire so easily and when it catches fire it burns only on the upper surface in open air. It is difficult to burn the fuel with the help of any sparking. So there is no risk in storage of this fuel even in residential houses. White manufacturing VOei, there is no involvement of any sort of risk like burning and explosion. Also there is no hazard in handling this fuel while touching and smelling. Even it has no adverse effect on skin.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
As VDel has energy level (135600 Blu./Gallon ) almost same as (hat of<br>
Diesel ( 136000 Btu./ Gallon ), when we use VOel in our diesel car we may enjoy same level of comfort and at the same time we may get more pull than Diesel when we are driving in hill road or when we are in need of quick acceleration. It is well known that average mileage obviously depends on engine design as weH as on the quality of fuel and condition of road. The age of engine also is a factor. As the energy level of VDel is almost same as that of diesel, the average mileage in a specific diesel car obviously remains same. As we have tested the fuels on the same diesel Ambassador car we have found the average mileage for the car on road as given below :-<br>
Running with VDel— 12.2 Km/Lit.<br>
Running with Diesel — 12.5 Km / Lit.<br>
*As Sunflower oil is nearly 5.88% less combustible than Mustard oi, so if we increase the ratio of Sunflower oil than 15% then we can not get better mileage due to improper burning.<br>
"As Olive oil is a very costly oil, it is not so purposeful as regards economic point of view. So It has not been tested elaborately. We find that it is nearly 19.6% more combustible than Mustard oil so we estimate that 20% would be the proper ratio and we get satisfactory result.<br>
*"As Palm oil does not give better performance in winter season, so it has not been tested It. We find that it is nearly 19.6% much combustible than Mustard oil so we estimate that 20% would be the proper ratio and we get satisfactory result. ""As Coconut oil is costly oil and does not give better performance in winter season, it is not so useable and it has not been tested elaborately. We find that it is nearly 40% more combustible than Mustard oH so we estimate that 25% would be the proper ratio and we get excellent result.<br>
The bold lettered Results show the best results. We prefer the combination of Kerosene and mustard oil at the ratio Kerosene: Mustard oil =85%:15%=17:3 as a specimen of VDel. It is the cheapest and possesses alt-round excellent results and also it works superb in winter season.<br>
