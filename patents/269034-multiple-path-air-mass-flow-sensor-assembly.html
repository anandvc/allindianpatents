				<td>MULTIPLE PATH AIR MASS FLOW SENSOR ASSEMBLY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates generally to air mass flow sensors and<br>
more particularly to a multiple path air mass flow sensor having improved<br>
measurement accuracy.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
[0002]	Modern internal combustion engines typically intended for<br>
use in passenger vehicles and trucks include extensive use of operational<br>
sensors and microprocessors to control engine operation, improve performance<br>
and fuel economy, and reduce emissions. In fact, the great improvements in<br>
these often conflicting operational parameters of the last several decades would<br>
simply not have been possible without the use of these systems.<br>
[0003]	One of the most commonly used sensors with an internal<br>
combustion engine and electronic controller is an air mass flow sensor.<br>
Typically, an air mass flow sensor includes a resistance element which is located<br>
in an air intake duct, often immediately after the air filter and before the duct is<br>
subdivided into the branches of the intake manifold or other structure. So<br>
disposed, the air mass flow sensor is exposed to the instantaneous flow of air to<br>
the engine. Data from the sensor is utilized by the engine controller to compute<br>
the instantaneous air mass flow which is utilized to, for example, adjust the air<br><br>
fuel mixture and optimize engine performance in accordance with predetermined<br>
parameters.<br>
[0004]	Ideally the air mass flow sensor will be located in an intake<br>
duct to ensure that the air impinging upon it is representative of the total air flow<br>
so that the output of the sensor accurately reflects the total instantaneous air<br>
mass flowing through the duct. This can be a challenge because the often<br>
convoluted duct and varying air velocities may create complex flow patterns<br>
which render accurate flow measurement difficult. This problem is especially<br>
acute at low flow rates which represent the most critical engine operating<br>
condition from the standpoints of emissions and fuel economy. Although<br>
reducing the size of the intake duct would seem to be a solution to this problem,<br>
since the size of the intake duct is mandated by the air flow requirements of the<br>
engine at full load, reducing its size at the sensor location to improve<br>
measurement accuracy reduces the volume of air provided to the engine,<br>
increases flow resistance and will thus interfere with achieving maximum engine<br>
power output. A larger intake duct, however, reduces the flow velocity and, as<br>
noted, renders air mass flow measurement more difficult, particularly under low<br>
flow conditions - precisely those conditions that are most critical to optimum<br>
engine operation.<br>
[0005]	The foregoing discussion suggests that improvements in the<br>
design of mass air flow sensor assemblies is desirable.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	A multiple path air mass flow sensor assembly for an internal<br>
combustion engine includes an intake duct which is divided into at least two<br>
separate ducts. A first duct has an air mass flow sensor disposed in<br>
conventional fashion therein. The second duct includes a damper or valve which<br>
may be selectively, partially or fully opened. At low air flow rates, the damper is<br>
closed forcing all air through the first duct. As engine speed increases and the<br>
air flow rate increases, the damper opens, either fully at a predetermined flow<br>
rate or proportionally over a predetermined range, to allow a larger volume of air<br>
through the intake duct. Processing of the signal from the air mass flow sensor<br>
by the engine controller or other processor is undertaken to compensate for the<br>
(bypass) air flowing through the second duct.<br>
[0007]	An air mass flow sensor assembly having a passive, spring<br>
biased damper is also disclosed. Here, the damper is opened by increased air<br>
flow and a sensor provides a signal indicating that the damper is open to the<br>
engine controller or other processor which recalculates the air mass flow based<br>
upon the open damper and the resulting bypass air flow.<br>
[0008]	The air mass flow sensor assembly according to the present<br>
invention exhibits improved measurement accuracy at low flow rates because the<br>
sensor is located in a duct smaller than those currently used with a comparable<br>
engine while providing reduced flow resistance and improved high volume air<br>
flow. Both parallel and non-parallel ducts defining parallel and non-parallel flow<br><br>
pathways as well as multiple, staged or sequenced bypass ducts and ducts<br>
having different areas or flow rates are also within the scope of this invention.<br>
[0009]	Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an air<br>
mass flow sensor assembly having improved low flow rate measurement<br>
accuracy.<br>
[0010]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide an air<br>
mass flow sensor assembly having improved high flow rate capability.<br>
[0011]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
air mass flow sensor assembly having improved low flow rate measurement<br>
accuracy and high flow rate capacity.<br>
[0012]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
air mass flow sensor assembly having a damper disposed in a duct parallel to a<br>
duct containing the mass air flow sensor.<br>
[0013]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
air mass flow sensor assembly having a passive, spring biased damper and<br>
position sensor disposed in a duct parallel to a duct having a mass air flow<br>
sensor.<br>
[0014]	Further objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent by reference to the following description and appended<br>

or feature.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 1, an inlet or intake duct assembly for<br>
an internal combustion engine is illustrated and designated by the reference<br>
number 10. The intake duct assembly 10 includes an air filter assembly 12 which<br>
draws in ambient air and includes an air filtration element 14. The air filter<br>
assembly 12 communicates with an air inlet or intake duct 16 which provides<br>
combustion air to an internal combustion engine 18. In a first embodiment of an<br>
air mass flow sensor assembly 20 according to the present invention, the air inlet<br><br>
or intake duct 16 is separated into a first, sensing duct 22 and a second, bypass<br>
duct 24 by a divider or partition 26. While illustrated as parallel, it should be<br>
understood that the first, sensing duct 22 and the second, bypass duct 24 may<br>
be separate, non-parallel and sinuous or convoluted, for example, to fit within<br>
available under-hood space or match and connect to air inlet and engine<br>
components.<br>
[0020]	Disposed within the first, sensing duct 22 is a conventional<br>
air mass flow sensor 30. The air mass flow sensor 30 is configured and<br>
arranged to provide an accurate indication of the instantaneous air mass flow<br>
through the first, sensing duct 22. Typically, the air mass flow sensor 30 may<br>
include a resistive element such as a carbon or wirewound resistor. The air mass<br>
flow sensor 30 also includes an output conductor or cable 32 which carries the<br>
data signal from the air mass flow sensor 30 to a microprocessor such as an<br>
engine controller or engine control module 36. The intake duct 16 extends to and<br>
includes an exemplary intake manifold 40. Although not illustrated, the intake<br>
duct assembly 10 may also include a turbo-charger or supercharger, if desired.<br>
[0021]	Disposed within the second, bypass duct 24 is a calibrated<br>
orifice 42 having a known or defined area. The calibrated orifice 42 improves the<br>
accuracy of air mass flow computations undertaken by the engine control module<br>
36 as will be more fully described below.. The second, bypass duct 24 also<br>
includes a moveable damper, flap, partition or valve 44. The damper or valve 44<br>
is sized to completely close off the second, bypass duct 24 when it is in its closed<br>
position, perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the walls of the bypass<br><br>
duct 24 and the direction of air flow, as illustrated in Figure 1. Thus, if the<br>
second, bypass duct 24 is square or rectangular in cross-section, for example,<br>
the damper or valve 44 is correspondingly shaped. About the periphery of the<br>
opening in the second, bypass duct 24 and adjacent the damper or valve 44 may<br>
be disposed a sealing lip, bead or flange 46 which assists in maintaining a tight<br>
seal between the damper or valve 44 and the walls of the second, bypass duct<br>
22 when the damper or valve 44 is in its closed position, as illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
[0022]	As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the damper or valve 44 is<br>
moved from its closed position, illustrated in Figure 1, through intermediate<br>
positions, to a fully open position, illustrated in Figure 2, by an electric, electronic<br>
or pneumatic actuator 48. The actuator 48 receives signals from the engine<br>
control module 36 through a conductor or cable 52 which command it to a fully<br>
closed, a fully open or an intermediate position.<br>
[0023]	Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment 20' of the present<br>
invention wherein the majority of components are the same but the damper<br>
actuator 48 has been replaced by an assembly 54 having a two position switch or<br>
rotary transducer 56 which provides data regarding the position of the damper or<br>
valve 44 to the engine control module 36 through a conductor or cable 58. As<br>
indicated by the arrow, the assembly 54 includes a spring biasing feature which<br>
urges the damper or valve 44 toward the closed position, against the sealing<br>
bead or flange 46. As the volume of air in the intake duct 16 increases, pressure<br>
against the damper or valve 44 increases, overcoming the resistance of the<br>
spring and the damper or valve 44 moves toward an open position, as illustrated<br><br>
in Figure 3. As the damper or valve 44 rotates and opens, the switch or<br>
transducer 56 changes state or provides a continuous signal indicating the<br>
position of the damper or valve 44 to the engine control module 36.<br>
[0024]	Figure 4 is a graph which presents two exemplary operating<br>
relationships between the total instantaneous air mass flow in the air intake duct<br>
16 and the per cent of opening of the damper or valve 44 relating to the<br>
embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The lower line,<br>
designated "A," illustrates that operational mode in which the actuator 48 is<br>
commanded by the engine control module 36 to move the damper or valve 44<br>
from its fully closed position to its fully opened position (without any intermediate<br>
position(s)) when air mass flow in the intake duct 16 reaches or exceeds a<br>
certain predetermined rate. Stated somewhat differently, when total<br>
instantaneous air mass flow is below the line "A," the damper or valve 44 will be<br>
closed; when it is above the line "A," the damper or valve 44 will be open. This<br>
threshold value may be determined by, for example, either the speed or<br>
acceleration of the internal combustion engine 18 or data from the air mass flow<br>
sensor 30.<br>
[0025]	A second line, "B," in Figure 4 presents an alternative<br>
operational mode in which increased air mass flow, above a certain<br>
predetermined threshold, causes a corresponding or proportional opening of the<br>
damper or valve 44 as the air mass flow continues to increase. It will be<br>
appreciated that the proportional relationship between the air mass flow and the<br>
per cent of opening of the damper or valve 44 a presented by line "B" while<br><br>
beginning at 0 per cent, effectively is no longer proportional after the damper or<br>
valve 44 is significantly open. This is the result of a well understood feature of<br>
control dampers and valves whereby little or no proportional control of the<br>
controlled fluid is achieved after the valve or damper is about two-thirds open. It<br>
should, however, be appreciated that the 75 per cent value is exemplary only and<br>
that this value may be higher or lower depending upon particular applications and<br>
operating conditions.<br>
[0026]	When the damper or valve 44 is partially or fully open, it is<br>
necessary that the engine control module 36 correct or recalibrate its<br>
computation of the instantaneous air mass flow through the air intake duct 16<br>
(from its sensing and computations undertaken when the damper or valve 44 is<br>
fully closed) since all of the air passing through the intake duct 16 is no longer<br>
passing through the first, sensing duct 22. This correction or recalibration can be<br>
undertaken electronically in the engine control module 36 or, if the sensor<br>
assembly 10 is a stand alone device, within a self-contained microprocessor (not<br>
illustrated). In the case of operation according to line "A," the correction simply<br>
requires multiplying the sensed air mass flow by the inverse of the ratio of air<br>
passing through the first, sensing duct 22 and the intake duct 16 when the<br>
damper or valve 44 is fully open. In the case of operation according to line "B,"<br>
the relationship between the percent of opening of the valve or damper 44 and<br>
the actual flow through the second, bypass duct 24 must first be known or<br>
established and this relationship utilized to make the necessary correction in<br><br>
accordance with the inverse ratio of sensed air mass flow and total air mass flow<br>
described immediately above.<br>
[0027]	With regard to the embodiment 20' of the invention illustrated<br>
in Figure 3, similar operational considerations, particularly correcting or<br>
recalibrating the air mass flow value sensed by the air mass flow sensor 30<br>
based upon the flow rate through the second, bypass duct 24, to reflect the<br>
actual total air mass flow must be undertaken, Here, however, the two position<br>
switch or transducer 56 provides data to the engine control module 36 regarding<br>
the present position of the damper or valve 44 resulting from the force of the<br>
moving air on the damper or valve 44. The engine control module 36 (or other<br>
processor) then computes the actual, instantaneous air mass flow passing<br>
through the inlet duct 16 in accordance with known relationships between the<br>
position of the damper or valve 44 and the air mass flow sensed by the air mass<br>
flow sensor 30 in the first, sensing duct 22.<br>
[0028]	While the foregoing description has centered upon an air<br>
mass flow sensor assembly 20 having two paths or ducts: a first main or sensing<br>
path or duct and a second auxiliary or bypass path or duct, it should be<br>
appreciated that the invention and its operating principles encompasses a<br>
multiple path air mass flow sensor having two, three, four or more bypass ducts<br>
in operational parallel with a single sensing duct. In any such multiple path or<br>
duct sensor assembly, the sensing duct is always open and one, two or more<br>
bypass ducts are opened in response to higher engine speeds and loads. As the<br>
bypass ducts are sequentially and cumulatively opened, the engine control<br><br>
module 36 or other controller corrects or recalibrates the output of the air mass<br>
flow sensor 30 to compensate for the reduced air mass flow through the sensing<br>
duct and increased flow through the bypass ducts. For example, if the assembly<br>
includes three equal flow rate ducts, i.e., one sensing duct and two bypass ducts,<br>
and all three ducts are open, the output of the air mass flow sensor would be<br>
tripled to compensate for the fact that it is sensing only one-third the total air<br>
mass flow passing through the inlet duct 16.<br>
[0029]	Additionally, it should be understood that while the foregoing<br>
description has centered upon an air mass flow sensor assembly 20 having two<br>
ducts of equal flow rates, an air mass flow sensor assembly having two or more<br>
ducts of known but unequal flow rates or areas is also within the scope of the<br>
present invention. For example, a main sensing duct 22 may have a flow rate or<br>
area of one unit whereas a bypass duct 24 and its calibrated orifice 42 may have<br>
a flow rate or area of two units or three units. When such a bypass duct 24 is<br>
opened, the engine control module 36 or other controller is programmed to and<br>
applies the appropriate ratio correction or recalibration to the output of the air<br>
mass flow sensor 30. If the main to bypass flow ratio is 1:2, so that only one-<br>
third of the total air mass flow is passing through the sensing duct 22 when the<br>
bypass duct is fully open, the engine control module 36 triples the sensed value<br>
of the air mass flow sensor 30; if the main to bypass flow ratio is 1:3, the engine<br>
control module 36 multiplies the sensed value by four when the bypass duct is<br>
fully open.<br><br>
[0030]	The foregoing description of the present invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and variations that do not depart from the gist of the<br>
invention are intended to be, and are, within the scope of the invention. Such<br>
variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
