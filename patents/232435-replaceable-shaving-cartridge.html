o<br>
Shaving systems often consist of a handle and a replaceable cartridge in which one or more blades are mounted in a plastic housing. After the blades in a canridge have become dull from use, the cartridge is discarded, and replaced on the handle with a new cartridge. In some shaving systems the blades are rt'sihently mounted with respect to the cartridge housing and deflect under the force of skin contact during shaving. In some shaving systems the connection ot the cartridge to the handle provides a pivotal mounting of the cartridge with respect to the handle so that the cartridge angle adjusts to follow the contours the surface being shaved. In such systems, the cartridge can be biased toward an at rest position by the action of a spring-biased plunger (a cam follower) carried on the handle against a cam. surface on the- cartridge housing.<br>

mounted.  Interconnect member 24 includes base 27, which removably and fixedly atraches to asymmetrical extension 26 (Fig. 19) on handle 12, and two arms 28 that pivotally support housiig 16 at'its two sides.<br>
Refen ing to Fig. 3, handle 12 includes metallic colored plastic component 30 as a primary structural member on which the remaining components are mounted.  Elongated portion 32 of component 30 has recess 34 for receiving metal (e.g., zinc) weight 36, which is sandwiched between plastic gripping portions 38 and 40 to provide a hand-gripping structure in the completed unit.  Plastic gripping portions 38 and 40 are made of an elastomeric plastic outer gripping layer 37 (e.g., thermoplastic elastomer) and a nonel-aatotneri^ plastic support layer 39 (e.g., of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) thereunder made by two-color molding. The nonelastomeric plastic support layer has extensions 41 that are press-fitted into weight 36 in elongated portion 32.  Fig. 3A illustrates the undeformed shape of extension 41 (in phantom) and the interference fit made by it at projection 43.<br>
Cartr idge support structure 42 extends from the end of elongated portion 32.  It includes trapezoid shaped extension 26 (see Fig. 19) and the components that provide a spring-biasec plunger action for biasing of housing 16 rolatives to interconnect: member 24,  It also includes components tlat provide for ejection of cartridge 14 from handle 12.<br>
sprinj-biased plunger 44, spring 46, and U-shaped ejector 48 are received within recess 49 of cartridge support structure 42,  Ejector button 50 is received in opening 52 on the top surface of support structure 42 and has bottom extensions 54 that are received within<br>
rectangular r ;gion 56 at the back narrow portion of ejector 48.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4, 4A and 15, housing 16 of cartridge 14 :as inwardly facing slots 58 in side walls 60 for rt-ceiving the edges of the base portions 59 of blades is and respective resilient arms 62 (Fig. 15) on which each blade 18 is rjsiliently supported.  Blades 18 are located in a substantially unobstructed region 64 between side walls 60 to provide fo- ease of rinsing of the cartridge during use.<br>
Cap 2; provides a lubricous shaving aid and is received in slot 66 at the rear of housing 16. Cap 22 may bo made of a naterial comprising a mixture of a hydrophobia material and i water leachable hydrophilic polymer material, as is known in the art and is described, e.g., in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,113,585 and 5,454,164, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Guard 20 includes a finned elastomeric unit mounted at the front of housing 16 to engag-3 and stretch the user's skin; other skin engaging protrusions, e.g., as described in U,S Patent No. 5,191,712, which is hereby incorporated by reference, can be used. Clips 68 are secured at the respective sides of housing 16 inside of raised edges 70 of side walls 60 in order to retain blades 18 within housing 16 and to locate the cutting edges of the spring-biased blades at a desired exposure.<br>
Clips 68 also wrap around the bottom of housing 16 and prevent the'removal of pivotal'support ends 72 of arms 28 of interconnect member 24.  Base structure 27 has an opening 74 ai. the top through which spring-biased plunger 44 of the handle passes to act on a cam surface (not shown in Fig. 4) on the bottom of housing 16.  Base structure 27 may have a curved or beveled shape.<br>
Figs. 5-12 and 19 show the details of plunger 44, ejector 48, button 50, and cartridge support structure 42.<br><br>
Referring to F:.g. 5, recess 49 within cartridge support structure 42 has wide front portion 76 for receiving arms 78 of ejector 48 .Fig. 10) and a narrower portion 80 for receiving narrower portion 82 of ejector 48.  Rectangular region 56 at narrow portion 82 of ejector 48 is generally aligned with opening 52 at the upper surface of support structure 42, -.hough rectangular region 56 is movable with respect, to opening 52 along slide axis 83 as ejector 48 is pushed outward by ejector button SO.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and 12, each extension 54 -of ejector button 50 has an outwardly directed groove 84 that slides on a respective track 86 within opening 52 along axis 83.  The upper surfaces 85 defining grooves 84 slide on the upper surfaces 89 of tracks 86, and the lower surfaces 91 defining groves 84 effect capture on or abut the lower surfaces 93 of tracks 86.  Extensions 54 have inclined surfaces 87 thit coact with the curved upper corners of tracks 86 to daflect extensions 54 inward as button 50 is inserted into cartridge support structure 42.  When grooves 84 on extensions 54 align with tracks 86, extensions 54 substantially ceturn to their undeflected position and lock ejector button 50 in place within opening 52.  Ejector 48 is placed within recess 49 before button 50 is inserted so that the ends of extensions 54 will be located within rectangular region 56 so as to retain ejector 48 within cartridge support structure, 42.  Extensions £4 push against surfaces 94 of ejector 48 when ejector button 50 is pushed toward the end of handle 12. After button 50 has been inserted, upper vertical surfaces 96 of extensions 54 sit within the space between upper surfaces 98 of opening 52.<br>
Spring 46 (Fig. 3) extends through the space between extensions 54 and is guided by the curved lower surface of spring guide £0 on button 50.  As shown in Fig. 8, the lower<br>
surface defining recess 49 also has a curved central portion 92 to receive and guide spring 46.<br>
As shovn in Figs. 6 and 11, plunger 44 has flat: body 106, cylindrical rear extension 100 for receiving spring 46 (Fly. 3), curved front cam follower portion 102 for acting on the camminc surface 136 (Fig. 18) of housing 16, side arras 104, and aligned rear guide portions 108.  Flat body 106 is positicned within the flat front portion of recess 49 (Fig. 6) ,  The portions of side arms 104 and aligned rsar guide portions 108 above and below body 106 are located within slots 110, 112 located on both sides of asymmetrical extension 26.  Side arms 104 have stop surfaces 114 that prevent forwaid movement of plunger 44 beyond the front end of slot 110 or 112.  The portions of side arms 104 and guide portions 108 ebove and below recess 49 within slots 110, 112 act as guides to guide the sliding action of plunger 44 along axis 83,<br>
Side arms 104 have inclined surfaces 120 to cause downward bias; ng of arms 104 when plunger 44 is inserted into recess 4
Referring to Figs. 5 and 9j one surface of asymmetrical nxtension 26 includes depressions 122 for receiving detimts within base structure 27 of cartridge 14 in order to r-jtain cartridge 14 on extension 26.<br>
In manufacture oi? handle 12, the hand gripping components ar-i assembled by first inserting weight 36 into recess 34, and then press-fitting extensions 41 of components 38, 40 into aligned apertures in weight 36.<br>
Weight 36 and components 38, 40 are locked in place by the interference f .t between extensions 41 and projections 43, and elastomeriu layer 37 deforms to provide a seali. between the side walls of elongated portion 32 of plastic component 30 and weight *6. (Fig. :3A shows the undeformed shapes; of the components in phantom.)<br>
In assembling the components of cartridge support structxire 42 a; the end of handle 12, ejector 48 is first inserted into recess 49. Spring 46 and plunger 44 are then inserted.  inclined surfaces 120 of side arms 104 are biased during insertion toward the middle of the recess and then snap into slot 110 or 112 (depending on plunger orientation) locking plunger 44, spring 46, and ejector 48 in place in cartridge support structure 42.  Spring 46 acts both to bias ejector 48 backward against the surfaces of recess 49 and button extensions 54 and to bias plunger 44 forward, stop surfaces 114 being biased against the forward edges of slot 110 or 112.  Button 50 is inserted into opening 52 after ejector 48 has been inserted into position.  Inclined surfaces 87 are biased inward by the curved upper portions of rails 86, and ejector button 50 is snapped into place with tracks 8€ being located within grooves 84.<br>
Figs. L3-18 show further details of replaceable cartridge 14 end its pivotal movement. Referring to Fig. 13, interconnect member 24 is shown assembled to housing 16 with pivotal support ends 72 retained by clips 68.  It is seen that baso structure 27 has a trapezoidal shaped recess 130 that has Lhe same shape as extension 26 and mates with extension 26.<br>
Referring to Pig. 15, housing 16, shown before the other cartridge components have been assembled or it, has recesses 132 .n which the pivotal support ends 72 on the ends of arms ;&gt;8 are received.  Arms 28 deflect as support<br>
ends 72 are it serted through the openings to recesses 132 and then snap back to an undeflected orientation after ends 72 are within recesses 132 to retain ends 72 in place.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4A and 9, detents 132 within recess 130 of base 27 mate with depressions 122 of asymmetrical 
Referring to Pigs. 16-18, it is seen that each pivotal support end 72 has a lower curved surface 138 that slides on upp«»r curved surface 140 of housing 16, providing a pivot axis .it the center of a circle that includes surface 140.  The pivat axis thus is in front of the blades in the region of guard 20.  Fig. 16 shows housing 16 in an unbiased position in wiich pivotal support ends 72 support the front surface of guide wall 16:2.  Fig. 17 shows the forwardly biased position for housing 16, in which case the forward surface of pi/ot support ends 72 are pushed up against a forward wall portion of housing 16.  This is the at rctst position for nousing 16 prior to shaving. The forwarclly-biased at rest position is achieved by contouring camming surface 136 so that plunger 44 having cam follower surface 102 has an at rest position near the front of housing 16, as shown in Fig. 18.<br>
Fig. .8 shows the range of pivotal motion for housing 16.  During shaving, cap 22 will initially contact the user's sUn, and housing 16 will pivot clockwise »nd generally follow the contours of the user's face, being biased by pli nger 44.  The cap up initial orientation will cause the ble.de closer to cap 22 to initially be pushed against the i.kin more than the blades closer to the guard. However, the pivot at the region of guard and the light<br>
return force c mse the cartridge to be "guard heavy1' during shaving/ with i higher load on the guard than the cap. The three blades a;:e provided with progressive initial exposures, def .ned as the perpendicular distance or height of the blade edge measured with respect to a plane tangential to nhe skin contacting surfaces of the cartridge components immediately in front of and behind each blade, in particular, the primary blade has a negative initial exposure, the tecond blade has zero initial exposure, and the third blade has positive initial exposure.  The spring constants and {reloads for the blades are the same, and the blades have "piogressive force" distribution during shaving; i.e., the force on the third blade is greater than the force on the first blade, and the force on the second blade is intermediate tc the forces on the first and third blade.5 or equal to the fcrce on either the first or third blade.  It is believed that beneficial shaving results are achieved when cartridges with three resiliently mounted blades exhibit, during shaving, such a progressive force pattern.<br>
Qthejv Embodiments<br>
Other enbodiiwante of the invention are within the scope of the appended claims. The base strupture could be held on the housing with a releasable latch.  The lolades could b« loaded from the bottom instead of the top. The cartridge support structure could be made as a unit separate from the handle and attached to it*  In place of frapezoidal extension 26 (Fig. 19), a six-sided extension 226 (Fig. 20), or other asymmetrical shape could be employed.<br>
The pivotal connection could be provided by pins in respective holes, shell bearings, and other techniques. E.g., referring to Fig. 21, the pivotal support structure could be provided by a flexible plastic hinge portion 200 that is made of material that is more flexible than the<br>
housing 202 ani connects the housing 202 and interconnect member 204 at a pivot region 206; these components could be made by two-color molding.  Alternatively, referring tcj Fig. 22, the housing 208 and the interconnect member 210 may be made of the same piece of plastic, and the pivotal support structure may be provided by a living hinge 212.  A living hinge could also be used with housings and interconnect: members of different plastics. What is claimed is;<br><br><br><br><br><br>
