				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a preventive<br>
and/or remedy for retinal nerve diseases, which<br>
comprise a novel alkyl ether derivative or a salt<br>
thereof as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The retina acting as a photoreceptive tissue<br>
is located at the inner surface of the wall of eyeball.<br>
When pathologic lesion occurs on the retina, eyesight<br>
fails, sometimes resulting in blindness. Such retina<br>
is broadly divided into sensory retina and retinal<br>
pigment epithelium. Such sensory retina is divided<br>
into 9 layers, and comprises visual cells as first<br>
neuron, bipolar cells as second neuron, ganglion cells<br>
as third neuron, and other cells (Hyojun Ganka Gaku, 7th<br>
edition, pp. 103-107, Igaku-Shoin Ltd., 1998).<br>
Various retinal diseases are developed<br>
depending on the causes of diseases or onset forms.<br>
Examples of a disease affecting the retinal nerve may<br>
include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,. retinal artery<br>
obstruction, retinal venous obstruction, macular<br>
degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity.<br><br>
It has been considered that the cell death of<br>
retinal nerve cells is deeply associated with<br>
dysfunction of the retinal nerve. Factors, which<br>
contribute the cell death of refinal nerve cells, may<br>
include apoptosis, neurotoxicity caused by glutamic<br>
acid, the absence of a neurotrophic factor, the<br>
abnormality of mitochondria, caspase activation, nitric<br>
oxide, and autoimmunity {Atarashii Ganka, 19(7), 903-<br>
912, 2002). For example, from the viewpoint of<br>
suppression of the cell death with an excitatory<br>
neurotransmitter such as glutamic acid, compounds<br>
having antagonistic action to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid<br>
have been studied (JP-A-8-506807; Scrip No. 2229, p.<br>
13, 1997; Scrip No. 2307, p. 10, 1998).<br>
As stated above, various factors are<br>
associated with the cell death of retinal nerve cells.<br>
Other than compounds having antagonistic action to N-<br>
methyl-D-aspartic acid, compounds useful as remedies<br>
for diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,<br>
retinal artery obstruction, retinal venous obstruction,<br>
macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity,<br>
are required.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have found that an<br>
alkyl ether derivative represented by the general<br>
formula [1] described below or a salt thereof shows the<br>
effect of protecting retinal nerve cells, and thus that<br><br>
it is useful as a preventive and/or remedy for retinal<br>
nerve diseases, thereby completing the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
In the formula, R1 and R2, which may be the<br>
 same or different, each represent one or more groups<br>
selected from a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyl,<br>

alkenyloxy, amino, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl,<br>
 carbamoyl or heterocyclic group, a protected or<br>
unprotected amino, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, a nitro<br>
group and an oxo group; R3 represents a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkylamino group or a protected or<br>
unprotected amino or hydroxyl group; the ring A<br>
 represents a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic<br>
ring or a benzene ring; m and n each represent an<br>
integer between 1 and 6; and p represents an integer<br>
between 1 and 3.<br>

Test example 1 Protecting effect of retinal nerve in<br>
rat retinal ischemia reperfusion model<br>
(a) Preparation of retinal ischemia reperfusion model<br><br>
A rat retinal ischemia reperfusion model was<br>
prepared by a partially modified method of Steven Roth<br>
et al. (Experimental Eye Research, Vol. 65, pp. 771-<br>
779, 1997).<br>
As experimental animals, SD rats (SPF, 9-<br>
week-old, male, approximately 300 g of body weight)<br>
were used. Such rats were anesthetized with halothane<br>
(introduction: 4%; retention: 2%; gas composition: 70%<br>
air + 30% oxygen; gas flow rate: 2 L/min). The rat was<br>
placed on a fixing plate with the left body side<br>
upward. The skin located between the external acoustic<br>
foramen and the external canthus on the left side was<br>
incised, and the skin-incised portion was held with a<br>
hook. The temporal muscle was burned out with a<br>
bipolar coagulator (output: 4.5 W), and it was detached<br>
from the cranial bone and the mandibular arch.<br>
Thereafter, the optic nerve was detached under an<br>
operation microscope, and the central retinal blood<br>
vessel with the thus obtained optic nerve was tied up<br>
with a silk thread to such an extent that the silk<br>
thread did not damage the optic nerve, and thereafter,<br>
the silk thread was fixed with a vascular clip. During<br>
ischemia for 30 minutes, the incised portion of the rat<br>
was closed, and the rat was then placed in a cage<br>
without undergoing anesthesia, so that it was allowed<br>
to move freely. 30 minutes later, the vascular clip<br>
and the silk thread were removed under halothane<br>
anesthesia again, so that the blood was allowed to flow<br><br>
again. Thereafter, the incised portion was sutured.<br>
In order to prevent the operated eye (left eye) from<br>
infection, ofloxacin eye ointment was applied thereto,<br>
and the eyelid was sutured in order to prevent the<br>
cornea from being dried.<br>
(b)	Administration of test compound<br>
A test compound dissolved in distilled water<br>
was orally administered at an amount of 10 mg/kg to the<br>
rat from 2 days after retinal ischemia reperfusion,<br>
twice a day, for 14 days. In addition, distilled water<br>
was orally administered to a control group in the same<br>
manner described above.<br>
(c)	Electroretinogram (ERG) measurement<br>
ERG was measured in accordance with the<br>
method of Kawakami et al. (Gifu-dai Iki, Vol. 48, pp.<br>
166-175, 2000). That is to say, after adaptation to<br>
darkness for approximately 1 hour, a mixed solution<br>
consisting of 66 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 5<br>
mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride was intramuscularly<br>
injected into the muscle of thigh of the rat for<br>
anesthesia under red light. Thereafter, the rat was<br>
held on brain stereotaxis apparatus, and it was further<br>
anesthetized by eyedrop with 0.4% oxybuprocaine<br>
hydrochloride. Thereafter, contact lens electrode for<br>
ERG was applied thereto. At that time, a droplet of<br>
adjuvant used for application of special contact lens<br>
to the cornea was added dropwise to the portion between<br>
the electrode and the cornea, so that they were allowed<br><br>
to closely contact with each other. A ground electrode<br>
was implanted into the skin of the lower extremity.<br>
For photic stimulation, single-shot white light<br>
discharge flashing was applied by full light emission<br>
with a stroboscope (stimulation frequency: 0.017 Hz).<br>
Such a stroboscope was placed at a position of 10 cm<br>
from the anterior surface of cornea of the rat.<br>
Electric signals generated as a result of the photic<br>
stimulation were added together twice and then averaged<br>
using reaction adding/histogram analyzing apparatus.<br>
The obtained waveform was swept on a memory<br>
oscilloscope and then recorded by a thermal array<br>
recorder. ERG measurement was carried out on each eye.<br>
Since ERG was indicated with the population spike of<br>
wave (a) and wave (b), the amplitude value of ERG was<br>
defined as a value from the bottom of the wave (a) to<br>
the vertex of the wave (b). Such ERG measurement was<br>
carried out also on a normal control eye of the same<br>
individual. ERG of the ischemic eye was evaluated as a<br>
ratio to the value of normal control eye. ERG was<br>
measured after adaptation to darkness at 2 days after<br>
retinal ischemia reperfusion, and at approximately 1<br>
hour after the final administration,<br>
(d) Results<br>
The ratio of the ERG amplitude value of the<br>
ischemic eye to the normal control eye was 35% in the<br>
control group, to which distilled water had been<br>
administered. In contrast, the same above ratio was<br><br>
65% in the group, to which 1-(3-(2-(l-benzothiophene-5-<br>

temperature for 1.5 hours. Thereafter, water was added<br>
to the reaction mixture, and the pH thereof was<br>
adjusted to pH 1.0 by addition of 6 mol/1 hydrochloric<br>
acid. Thereafter, an organic layer was separated. The<br>
organic layer was washed with a saturated saline<br>
solution and then dried over anhydrous magnesium<br>
sulfate. The solvent was distilled away under a<br>
reduced pressure, so as to obtain a yellow oil product,<br>

solution was cooled to 5°C. Thereafter, 12.7 ml of a<br>
tetrahydrofuran solution containing a 1 mol/1 borane-<br>
tetrahydrofuran complex was added dropwise thereto, and<br>
the obtained mixture was stirred at a room temperature<br>
for 17 hours. Thereafter, 10 ml of acetone was added<br>
to the reaction mixture, and the obtained mixture was<br>
then stirred for 30 minutes. Thereafter, 6.0 ml of 6<br>
mol/1 hydrochloric acid was added thereto, followed by<br>
heating to reflux for 2 hours. The reaction solution<br>
was cooled, and water and ethyl acetate were added to<br>
the reaction mixture. The pH thereof was adjusted to<br>
pH 13 by addition of a 2 mol/1 aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, and an organic layer was then separated. The<br>
organic layer was washed with a saturated saline<br>
solution and then dried over anhydrous magnesium<br>
sulfate. The solvent was distilled away under a<br>
reduced pressure, so as to obtain 1.13 g of a yellow<br>
oil product, 1-(2-(2-(l-benzothiophene-5-<br>
