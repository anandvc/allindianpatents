COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]]<br>
"ANTHRANILAMIDE COMPOUNDS"<br>
SCHERING AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, of Mullerstrasse 178, D-13342 Berlin, Germany.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
ORIGINAL	28 SEP 2006<br><br>
GRANTED <br><br>
6-10-2006 <br><br>
The invention relates to substituted anthranilamides and their use as pharmaceutical agents for treating diseases that are triggered by persistent angiogenesis as well as their intermediate products for the production of anthranilamides.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis can be the cause of various diseases, such as psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases and arteriosclerosis or can result in an aggravation of these diseases.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor (VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor) can be used for treating such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as tumor vascularization. For example, it is known that the growth of tumors can be inhibited by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the factor VEGF via its receptor. So that VEGF can exert this action, it is necessary that VEGF bind to the receptor, and a tyrosine phosphorylation is induced.<br><br><br><br><br>
It has now been found that compounds of general formula I<br><br>
in which<br>
A        stands for the group =NR ,<br>
W       stands for oxygen, sulfur, two hydrogen atoms or the group =NR8,<br>
Z	stands for a bond, the group =NR10 or =N-, branched or unbranched<br>
C1-12-alkyl or the group<br><br>
m, n and o stand for 0-3,<br>
Ra, Rb, Re, Ra, Re, Rf, independently of one another, stand for hydrogen, fluorine, C1-4 alkyl or the group =NR11, and/or Ra and/or Rb can form a bond with Re and/or Rd, or Re can form a bond with Re and/or Rf, or up to two of radicals Ra-Rf can close a bridge with up to 3 C-atoms each to form R1 or to form R7,<br>
R1        stands for branched or unbranched C1-C12-alkyl or C2-12-alkenyl that is<br><br>
optionally substituted in one or more places with halogen, hydroxy, C1-6-alkyloxy, aralkyloxy, C1-6-alkyl; and/or NR12R13; or C3-10-cycloalkyl or C3. 10-cycloalkenyl that is optionally substituted in one or more places with halogen, hydroxy, C1-6-alkyloxy, C1-6-alkyl and/or NR12R13; or aryl or hetaryl that is optionally substituted in one or more places with halogen, hydroxy, C1-6-alkyloxy, aralkyloxy, C1-6-alkyl and/or C1-6-alkyl that is substituted in one or more places with halogen,<br>
X        stands for C1-6-alkyl,<br>

heteroatom, as well as isomers and salts thereof, stop a tyrosine phosphorylation or persistent angiogenesis and thus prevent the growth and propagation of tumors.<br><br>
If R7 forms a bridge to R1 , heterocyclic compounds are produced, to which R1 is fused. For example, there can be mentioned:<br><br>
If Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, independently of one another, represent hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, Z forms an alkyl chain.<br><br><br>
If Ra and/or Rb form a bond with Rc and/or Rd, or Re and/or Rd form a bond with Re and/or Rf, Z stands for an alkenyl chain or an alkinyl chain.<br>

The compounds according to the invention prevent a phosphorylation, i.e., certain tyrosine kinases can be inhibited selectively, whereby the persistent angiogenesis can be stopped. Thus, for example, the growth and the propagation of tumors is stopped.<br>
The compounds of general formula I according to the invention also contain the possible tautomeric forms and comprise the E-isomers or Z-isomers, or, if a chiral center is present, also the racemates and enantiomers.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their physiologically compatible salts can be used as pharmaceutical agents based on their inhibitory activity relative to the phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor. Based on their profile of action, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for treating diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Since the compounds of formula I are identified as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases KDR and FLT, they are suitable in particular for treating those diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis that is triggered via the VEGF receptor or by an increase in vascular permeability.<br>
The subject of this invention is also the use of the compounds according to the invention as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases KDR and FLT.<br>
Subjects of this invention are thus also pharmaceutical agents for treating tumors or use thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used either alone or in a formulation as pharmaceutical agents for treating psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; flbrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis and injuries to nerve tissue.<br>
In treating injuries to nerve tissue, quick scar formation on the injury sites can be prevented with the compounds according to the invention, i.e., scar formation is prevented<br><br>
    from occurring before the axons reconnect. A reconstruction of the nerve compounds was thus facilitated.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-induced edemas can also be suppressed.<br>
Such pharmaceutical agents, their formulations and uses, are also subjects of this invention.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of general formula I for the production of a pharmaceutical agent for treating tumors; psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, and injuries to nerve tissue.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-induced edemas can also be suppressed.<br>
To use the compounds of formula I as pharmaceutical agents, the latter are brought into the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which in addition to the active ingredient for enteral or parenteral administration contains suitable pharmaceutical, organic or inorganic inert carrier materials, such as, for example, water, gelatin, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be present in solid form, for example as tablets, coated tablets, suppositories, or capsules, or in liquid form, for example as solutions,<br><br><br>
suspensions or emulsions. They also contain, moreover, adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers.<br>
For parenteral administration, especially injection solutions or suspensions, especially aqueous solutions of the active compounds in polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, are suitable.<br>
As carrier systems, surface-active adjuvants such as salts of bile acids or animal or plant phospholipids, but also mixtures thereof as well as liposomes or components thereof can also be used.<br>
For oral administration, especially tablets, coated tablets or capsules with talc and/or hydrocarbon vehicles or binders, such as for example, lactose, corn starch or potato starch, are suitable. The administration can also be carried out in liquid form, such as, for example, as juice, to which optionally a sweetener or, if necessary, one or more flavoring substances, is added.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredients can vary depending on the method of administration, age and weight of the patient, type and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. The daily dose is 0.5-1000 mg, preferably 50-200 mg, whereby the dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or divided into 2 or more daily doses.<br>
The above-described formulations and forms for dispensing are also subjects of this invention.<br>
The production of the compounds according to the invention is carried out according to methods that are known in the art. For example, compounds of formula I are obtained, in that<br><br><br><br>
a) a compound of general formula II<br><br>
in which D to G have the above-mentioned meanings, and A is OR13, whereby R13 is hydrogen or C1-4-alkyl or C1-4-acyl, is obtained by first haying the amine be alkylated and<br>
COA then be converted into an amide, or NH2 be converted into halogen, A be converted<br>
into an amide, and halogen be converted into the corresponding amine, and optionally a<br>
protective group be cleaved, an amine be acylated or a ketone be reduced, whereby the<br>
amine is converted into an oxime or converted, by expanding the ring, into an amide or<br>
lactone,<br>
or<br><br>
b) a compound of formula III<br><br><br>
     in which D to G have the above-mentioned meaning, and A is halogen or OR13, whereby R   can be hydrogen, low alkyl or acyl, is obtained by having COA be converted into an amide, and the nitro group be reduced to amine and then alkylated,<br>
or<br>
c)  a compound of formula IV<br><br>
IV in which D to G have the above-mentioned meaning, and K means hydroxy or halogen, and A is halogen or OR13, whereby R13 can be hydrogen, low alkyl or acyl, is obtained by having K be converted into an amine, COA be converted into an amide, or, if K means hydroxy, by having K be converted into halogen and then having the process be continued as above,<br>
or<br>
d) a compound of formula V<br><br>
V is obtained by having it first be alkylated, and having the anhydride then be converted into the amide.<br><br><br>
The sequence of steps can be reversed in all cases.<br>
The amide formation is carried out according to methods that are known in the literature.<br>
For amide formation, it is possible to start from a corresponding ester. The ester is reacted according to J. Org. Chem. 1995, 8414 with aluminum trimethyl and the corresponding amine in solvents such as toluene at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent. If the molecule contains two ester groups, both are converted into the same amide.<br>
When nitriles are used instead of ester, amidines are obtained under analogous conditions.<br>
For amide formation, however, all processes that are known from peptide chemistry are also available. For example, the corresponding acid can be reacted with the amine in aprotic polar solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, via an activated acid derivative, that can be obtained, for example, with hydroxybenzotriazole and a carbodiimide, such as, for example, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or else with preformed reagents, such as, for example, HATU (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201) or BTU, at temperatures of between 0°C and the boiling point of the solvent. For the amide formation, the process can also be used with the mixed acid anhydride, acid chloride, imidazolide or azide. When acid chloride is reacted, dimethylacetamide is preferred as a solvent at temperatures from room temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 80- 100°C.<br>
If various amide groups are to be introduced into the molecule, for example, the second ester group must be introduced into the molecule after the first amide group is<br><br>
produced and then amidated, or one molecule is in one group as an ester while the other is present as acid, and the two groups are amidated in succession according to various methods.<br>
Thioamides can be obtained from anthranilamides by reaction with diphosphadithianes according to Bull Soc. Chim. Belg. 87, 229, 1978 or by reaction with phosphorus pentasulfide in solvents such as pyridine or else quite without solvent at temperatures of 0°C to 200°C.<br>
The reduction of the nitro group is performed in polar solvents at room temperature or elevated temperature. As catalysts for the reduction, metals such as Raney nickel or noble metal catalysts such as palladium or platinum or else palladium hydroxide optionally on vehicles are suitable. Instead of hydrogen, for example, ammonium formate, cyclohexene or hydrazine can also be used in a known way. Reducing agents such as tin(II) chloride or titanium(in) chloride can also be used as complex metal hydrides optionally in the presence of heavy metal salts. As reducing agents, iron can also be used. The reaction is then performed in the presence of an acid, such as, e.g., acetic acid or ammonium chloride optionally with the addition of a solvent, such as, for example, water, methanol, iron/ammonia, etc. In the case of extended reaction time in this variant, an acylation of the amino group can occur.<br>
If an alkylation of an amino group is desired, the amine can be subjected to a reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones, whereby the reaction is carried out in the presence of a reducing agent, such as, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride in a suitable inert solvent, such as, for example, ethanol, at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent. If a start is made from a primary amino group, a reaction can<br><br>
be carried out optionally in succession with two different carbonyl compounds, whereby mixed derivatives are obtained [Literature, e.g., Verardo et al. Synthesis (1993), 121; Synthesis (1991), 447; Kawaguchi, Synthesis (1985), 701; Micovic et al. Synthesis (1991), 1043]. It may be advantageous first to form the Schiff base by reaction of the aldehyde with the amine in solvents such as ethanol or methanol, optionally with the addition of adjuvants such as glacial acetic acid and then to add only reducing agent, such as, e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
An alkylation can also be achieved in that a reaction is carried out according to the Mitsonubo variant with an alcohol in the presence of, for example, triphenylphosphine and azodicarboxylic acid ester. An alkylation of the amino group can also be carried out, however, by alkylating agents such as halides, tosylates, mesylates or triflates. As solvents, for example, polar solvents such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide are suitable. The addition of an auxiliary base such as triethylamine, DABCO pyridine or potassium carbonate may be advantageous.<br>
Since the risk of double alkylation exists in a free amino group, isatoic acid anhydride can advantageously be used. With bases such as sodium hydride, but also cesium carbonate in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide at temperatures of between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 60°C, it can be converted into the anion that then is further reacted with the alkylating agent.<br>
Ether cleavages are performed according to processes that are common in the literature. In this case, a selective cleavage can also be achieved in several groups that are present in the molecule. In this case, the ether is treated, for example, with boron<br><br>
tribromide in solvents such as dichloromethane at temperatures of between -100°C up to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at -78°C. It is also possible, however, to cleave the ether by sodium thiomethylate in solvents such as dimethylformamide. The temperature can be between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 150°C. In benzyl ethers, the cleavage can also be accomplished with strong acids, such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, at temperatures from room temperature up to the boiling point.<br>
The conversion of a hydroxy group, which is in ortho- or para-position to a nitrogen of a 6-ring hetaryl, in halogen, can be performed, for example, by reaction with inorganic acid halides, such as, for example, phosphorus oxychloride, optionally in an inert solvent, at temperatures up to the boiling point of the solvent or the acid halide.<br>
The substitution of a halogen, tosylate, triflate or nonaflate, which is in ortho- or para-position to a nitrogen in a 6-membered heteroaromatic compound, can be accomplished by reaction with a corresponding amine in inert solvents, such as, for example, xylene, or in polar solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone or dimethylacetamide at temperatures of 60-170°C. Heating without solvent is also possible, however. The addition of an auxiliary base such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate, or the addition of copper and/or copper oxide can be advantageous. In the case of non-activated halogens or triflates, a palladium-catalyzed introduction of the amine portion is possible according to J. Org. Chem. 2000,1158. As a base, preferably sodium-t-butylate is used; as an auxiliary ligand, a biphenylphosphine is used.<br>
The introduction of the halogens chlorine, bromine or iodine via an amino group can be carried out, for example, also according to Sandmeyer, by the diazonium salts that<br><br>
are intermediately formed with nitrites being reacted with copper(I) chloride or copper(I) bromide in the presence of the corresponding acid such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid or with potassium iodide.<br>
If an organic nitrite is used, the halogens can be introduced, e.g., by adding methylene iodide or tetrabromomethane, into a solvent, such as, for example, dimethylformamide. The removal of the amino group can be achieved either by reaction with an organic nitrite in tetrahydrofuran or by diazotization and reductive boiling-down of the diazonium salt, for example, with phosphorus acid, optionally with the addition of copper(I) oxide.<br>
Introduction of fluorine can be accomplished by, for example, Balz-Schiemann reaction of diazonium tetrafluoroborate or according to J. Fluor. Chem. 76,1996, 59-62 by diazotization in the presence of HFxpyridine and subsequent boiling-down optionally in the presence of a fluoride ion source, such as, e.g., tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
The cleavage of the ketal protective groups is carried out in a known way, for example, by the reaction being performed in a solvent, such as ethanol or acetone, with an aqueous acid, preferably 4N hydrochloric acid, at temperatures of between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
The cleavage of the t-butoxycarbonyl group is carried out, as is generally known, in that the reaction is performed in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or ethanol, with an acid, such as, e.g., IN hydrochloric acid, at temperatures of between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent. It is also possible to cleave the t-BOC group with strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid at temperatures of between -20°C up to the boiling<br><br><br>
point, preferably at room temperature. A solvent such as methylene chloride is not absolutely necessary, but it may be advantageous.<br>
The reduction of a ketone takes place in a known way by a complex metal hydride, such as, for example, sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride, in solvents such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
The acylation of an amine is carried out in a known way either according to the process that is described under amide formation or by reaction with activated acid derivatives, such as, for example, acid chloride or acid anhydride in solvents such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran, optionally in the presence of bases such as triethylamine. An addition of catalytic amounts of dimethylaminopyridine may be advantageous.<br>
Expanding the ring of a ketone to the next-highest lactone can be achieved by Bayer-Villiger oxidation, for which a number of variants are described. The ketone can be reacted, for example, with a peracid, such as, m-chloroperbenzoic acid or magnesium monoperoxyphthalate in solvents, such as, for example, methylene chloride. A reaction with hydrogen peroxide in formic acid or sodium perborate in trifluoroacetic acid is also possible, however.<br>
Expanding the ring of the ketone to the next-highest lactam can be carried out in a known way by a Schmidt reaction of the ketone or by the Beckmann rearrangement of the oxime. For both reactions, an entire series of variations is described. In the Schmidt reaction, the ketone is reacted, for example, with sodium azide in strong acids, such as<br><br><br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or methanesulfonic acid without solvent or in solvents such as acetonitrile, chloroform or methylene chloride.<br>
In the Beckmann rearrangement, the oxime of a carbonyl compound is reacted with acids such as polyphosphoric acid or trimethylsilyl esters thereof or with Lewis acids, such as aluminum triiodide or iron(IH) chloride-impregnated montmorillonite without solvent or in solvents such as acetonitrile at elevated temperature. Mesylate or tosylate of the oxime can also be produced, however, and then treated with bases, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, or with Lewis acids, such as diethylaluminum chloride.<br>
The oxime formation is carried out in a known way by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in solvents such as ethanol, optionally with the addition of bases, such as pyridine, sodium acetate or aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, at temperatures up to the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
The isomer mixtures can be separated into enantiomers or E/Z isomers according to commonly used methods, such as, for example, crystallization, any form of chromatography or salt formation.<br>
The production of salts is carried out in the usual way, by a solution of the compound of formula I being mixed with the equivalent amount or an excess of a base or acid, which optionally is in solution, and the precipitate being separated or the solution being worked up in the usual way.<br><br>
The following examples explain the production of the compounds according to the invention, without limiting the scope of the claimed compounds to these examples.<br>
