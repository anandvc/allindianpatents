				<td>INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE RATIONALITY DIAGNOSTIC<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to an intake air temperature sensor rationality diagnostic.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines combust a fuel and air mixture to<br>
produce drive torque. More specifically, air is drawn into the engine through a<br>
throttle. The air is mixed with fuel and the air and fuel mixture is compressed<br>
within a cylinder using a piston. The air and fuel mixture is combusted within the<br>
cylinder to reciprocally drive the piston within the cylinder, which in turn<br>
rotationally drives a crankshaft of the engine.<br>
[0004] Engine operation is regulated based on several parameters<br>
including, but not limited to, intake air temperature (IAT), manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP), throttle position (TPS), engine RPM and barometric pressure<br>
(PBARO)- With specific reference to the throttle, the state parameters (e.g., air<br>
temperature and pressure) before the throttle are good references that can be<br>
used for engine control and diagnostic. Traditional internal combustion engines<br>
include an IAT sensor that directly measures the IAT. In some instances,<br>
however, the IAT sensor can become inaccurate as a result of damage, wear<br>
and/or a number of other factors. Accordingly, the IAT sensor should be<br><br>
monitored to determine whether the IAT that is determined based on the IAT<br>
sensor reading is rational.<br>
[0005] Some traditional internal combustion engine systems include a<br>
second IAT sensor, the reading from which is compared to that of the first IAT<br>
sensor in order to determine whether the first IAT sensor is rational. This<br>
additional IAT sensor increases cost and complexity and itself must be monitored<br>
for accuracy.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
determining whether a fault condition of an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor of<br>
an engine is present. The method includes estimating a first manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) based on a previously estimated first MAP and an estimated first<br>
mass air flow (MAF) as a function of the previously estimated first MAP and<br>
estimating a second MAP based on a previously estimated second MAP and a<br>
currently measured MAF. An IAT difference is determined based on the first<br>
MAP and the second MAP. Whether the fault condition of the IAT sensor is<br>
present is determined based on the IAT difference.<br>
[0007] In another feature, the method further includes calculating a<br>
MAP difference based on the first MAP and the second MAP, wherein the IAT<br>
difference is determined based on the MAP difference.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the step of determining whether the fault<br>
condition is present includes comparing the IAT difference to a threshold IAT<br><br>
difference and indicating an IAT fault when the IAT difference is greater than the<br>
threshold IAT difference.<br>
[0009] In another feature, the method further includes estimating the<br>
first MAF based on at least one of a throttle inlet pressure, an effective flow area<br>
through the throttle, a previously estimated first MAP, measured IAT and a<br>
previously estimated MAF.<br>
[0010] In another feature, the first MAP is estimated based on an<br>
estimated first engine flow rate (EFR) from an intake manifold of the engine.<br>
[0011] In still another feature, the second MAP is estimated based on<br>
an estimated second engine flow rate (EFR) from an intake manifold of the<br>
engine.<br>
[0012] In yet another feature, the first and second MAPs are estimated<br>
based on respective first and second exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) values.<br>
[0013] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary internal combustion<br>
engine system 10 is illustrated. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12, an<br>
intake manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. Air is drawn into the intake<br>
manifold 14 through an air filter 17 and a throttle 18. The air is mixed with fuel,<br>
and the fuel and air mixture is combusted within a cylinder 20 of the engine 12.<br><br>
More specifically, the fuel and air mixture is compressed within the cylinder 20 by<br>
a piston (not shown) and combustion is initiated. The combustion process<br>
releases energy that is used to reciprocally drive the piston within the cylinder 20.<br>
Exhaust that is generated by the combustion process is exhausted through the<br>
exhaust manifold 16 and is treated in an exhaust after-treatment system (not<br>
shown) before being released to atmosphere. Although a single cylinder 20 is<br>
illustrated, it is anticipated that the intake air rationality<br>
control of the present invention can be implemented with engines having more<br>
than one cylinder.<br>
[0021] A control module 30 regulates engine operation based on a<br>
plurality of engine operating parameters including, but not limited to, a pre-throttle<br>
static pressure (PPRE), a pre-throttle stagnation pressure (PPREO) (i.e., the air<br>
pressures upstream of the throttle), an intake air temperature (IAT), a mass air<br>
flow (MAF), a manifold absolute pressure (MAP), an effective throttle area (AEFF),<br>
an engine RPM and a barometric pressure (PBARO)- PPREO and PPRE are<br>
determined based on a pre-throttle estimation control, which is disclosed in<br>
commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. Pat. App. Serial No. 11/464,340, filed<br>
August 14, 2006.<br>
[0022] IAT, MAF, MAP and engine RPM are determined based on<br>
signals generated by an IAT sensor 32, a MAF sensor 34, a MAP sensor 36 and<br>
an engine RPM sensor 38, respectively, which are all standard sensors of an<br>
engine system. AEFF is determined based on a throttle position signal that is<br>
generated by a throttle position sensor, which is also a standard sensor. A<br><br>
throttle position sensor 42 generates a throttle position signal (TPS). The<br>
relationship between AEFF to TPS is pre-determined using engine dynamometer<br>
testing with a temporary stagnation pressure sensor 50 (shown in phantom in<br>
Figure 1) installed. Production vehicles include the relationship pre-programmed<br>
therein and therefore do not require the presence of the stagnation pressure<br>
sensor.<br>
[0023] The IAT rationality control of the present disclosure monitors the<br>
accuracy of the IAT sensor 32. More specifically, a first estimated MAP value<br>
(MAPI) and a second estimated MAP value (MAPI) are determined and the<br>
accuracy of the IAT sensor 32 is monitored based on a difference between MAPI<br>
and MAPI (∆MAP). More specifically, ∆MAP corresponds to a difference<br>
between the IAT sensed by the IAT sensor 32 and the actual IAT (AIAT) (see<br>
Figure 2). For example, the greater the AMAP in the positive or negative<br>
directions, the greater AIAT is. As a note, the "A" character indicates an<br>
estimated (i.e., not directly measured) value.<br><br><br>
EGRl is the estimated exhaust gas recirculation into the intake<br>
manifold (in the case that an EGR system is present);<br>
EFRl is the gas flow out of the intake manifold (i.e., into the<br>
cylinders); and<br>
VINT is the intake manifold volume (constant).<br><br>
where:	PINLET is the absolute pressure at the throttle inlet;<br>
AEFF is the effective flow area through the throttle and is determined<br>
based on the throttle position (TPS); and<br>
MAFLAG is a first order lag filter value that ranges between 0 and 1<br>
with a resolution of 0.1.<br><br>
If PR is not greater than 0.5283, the flow through the throttle is limited or choked<br>
and <p is constant and equal to if pr greater than less></p>
than 1, <p is determined based on the following relationship:></p>
 <br>
where:	BCORR is a correction factor that is determined based on PBARO and<br>
RPM;<br>
VEFF is the volumetric efficiency of the engine and is determined<br>
based on RPM and MAPM;<br>
N is the number of cylinders in the engine; and<br><br>
VDISP is the engine displacement.<br>
[0025] MAPI is determined based on the following relationship:<br><br>
where MAF2, is set equal to the currently measured MAF (MAFt). Accordingly,<br>
Equation 6 parallels Equation 1 except for the fact that MAFt is implemented<br>
instead of actually estimating MAF2. Furthermore, EFR2 is determined based<br>
on the following relationship:	J<br>
i<br>
  i<br>
Accordingly, Equation 7 parallels Equation 5 above.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps that are executed by<br>
the lAT rationality control will be described in detail. In step 300, control monitors<br>
the vehicle operating parameters. In step 301, control evaluates whether any<br>
applicable active diagnostic faults are detected. The applicable active faults are<br>
those that will prevent diagnostic system from making a correct or robust<br>
detection. The applicable active faults may include, but are not limited to, MAF<br>
sensor fault, TPS fault, and calculated intake charging temperature fault. It is<br>
understood that other fault signals may be considered. If any active diagnostic<br>
faults are detected, control loops back to step 300. In step 302, control calculates<br>
MAPI based on the operating parameters. In step 304, control calculates MAPI<br>
based on the operating parameters. Control calculates AMAP in step 305, and<br><br>
filters AMAP in step 306 using a low pass filter, for example. Control determines<br>
AIAT in step 307 based on the filtered ∆MAP. In step 308, control determines<br>
whether AIAT is greater than AIATTHR- If ∆IAT is greater than ∆IATTHR, control<br>
continues in step 310. If ∆IAT is not greater than AIATTHR, control continues in<br>
step 312. In step 310, control indicates a fault with the IAT sensor. In step 312,<br>
control indicates a pass with the IAT sensor and control ends.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
IAT control will be described in detail. The exemplary modules include a MAPI<br>
module 400, a MAPI module 402, a difference module 404, a ∆IAT module 406,<br>
a comparator module 410 a NOT module 411, an IAT fault module 412 and an<br>
IAT pass module 414. The MAPI module 400 and the MAPI module 402<br>
determine MAPI and MAPI, respectively, based on the engine operating<br>
parameters, as described in detail above. The difference module 404 determines<br>
AMAP based on MAPI and MAPI.<br>
[0028] The AIAT module 406 determines AIAT based on filtered<br>
AMAP. In one embodiment, the AIAT module 406 can process AMAP using a<br>
derived formula to calculate AIAT. In an alternative embodiment, the AIAT<br>
module 406 includes a pre-programmed look-up table and determines AIAT from<br>
the look-up table using ∆MAP as an input.<br>
[0029] The comparator module 410 compares ∆IAT to ∆IATTHR and<br>
generates a signal based thereon, which is output to the IAT fault module 412.<br>
For example, if ∆IAT is greater than ∆IATTHR, the comparator module 410<br><br>
generates a signal equal to "1", for example, and the IAT fault module 412<br>
indicates an IAT fault. If ∆IAT is not greater than ∆IATTHR, the comparator<br>
module 410 generates a signal equal to "0", for example, and the IAT fault<br>
module 412 does not indicate an IAT fault. The NOT module 411 inverts the<br>
signal that is output from the comparator module 410. The IAT pass module 414<br>
indicates an IAT pass based on the output of the NOT module 411.<br>
[0030] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
