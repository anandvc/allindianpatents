Related Application<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Patent Application Number 60/551,716, filed March 10,2004. This application also relates to United States Patent Application Number 10/635,804, filed August 5,2003.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The disclosure herein relates to portable communication networks and devices.<br>
Background<br>
There are many mobile or cellular network operators, or providers, in the world, often more than one in a single country. These network operators include, but are not limited to, operators who provide mobility services using a variety of pr otocols (e.g., GSM, GPRS, 3G, CDMA, TDMA, etc.) or their variants. These network operators provide voice and data services to their own subscribers and to subscribers from other networks. When the network operator provides service to a subscriber from a foreign country, it is referred to as "international roaming". When the network operator provides service to a subscriber from another network in the sajne country, it is referred to as "domestic roaming".<br>
When the subscriber is registered in the network with which it has a direct billing relationship, the serving network is often referred to as the Home Public M obile Network ("HPMN"). If the subscriber is in a network with which it does not have a direct billing relationship, the serving network is referred to as the Visited Public Mobile Network ("VPMN"), and the subscriber is referred to as an "inbound roamer" by the VPMN. The same subscriber is referred to as an "outbound roamer" by the HPMN. In such a case, the inbound roamers are treated as temporary subscribers from a service availability perspective, while the billing for usage incurred by them is through inter-carrier settlements via the HPMN of the subscriber.<br><br>
The provision of Welcome Multimedia Messages ("MM") ("WMM") or Welcome Roaming Content ("WRC") to roamers or roaming subscribers by Multimedia Messaging Services ("MMS") is typically limited to outbound roamers. This limitation is a result of WMMs/WRCs being sent to (directly or via MMS internetworking) and retrieved from the HPMN MMSC or HPMN WAP gateway of the roamer using the HPMN GGSN. The WMM/WRC for outbound roamers is therefore handled entirely by the HPMN MMSC or HPMN WAP gateway involving the HPMN GGSN because the HPMN components know the GPRS/MMS/internet subscription of the roamers. However, because of the network components involved, costs are incurred when WMM/WRC are provided to inbound roamers.<br>
Welcome SMS messages for inbound roamers are sent directly by a VPMN without involvement of the roaming subscriber's HPMN, and hence the VPMN absorbs the cost without paying the HPMN. Unlike SMS, which is a pure push service, the MMS is a push service for MMS/WAP-push alert and a pull service for MMS or WML-content retrieval service. With WMM/WRC for inbound roamers, hi contrast; because it has to be delivered from the HPMN MMSC/WAP-Gateway via the HPMN GGSN, MMSC and WAP-gateway, the VPMN is required to pay the HPMN for the cost even though it cannot charge the inbound roamers for the WMM/WRC. Therefore, when the inbound roamer retrieves the WMM/WRC from the HPMN via the HPMN GGSN, MMSC and WAP gateway, the retrieval incurs costs at the HPMN network. These costs would typically need to be passed to the roamer by the VPMN with which the roamer is roaming, and since typical VPMNs might find these costs unjustifiable, the VPMNs are reluctant to charge inbound roamers for the WMM/WRC.<br>
Therefore, unlike mobile terminated ("MT") SMS which is generally provided to subscribers free of charges, MT WMM/WRC for inbound roamers incurs GPRS cost at the VPMN, and the VPMN thus bills the HPMN to recover the cost. Consequently, there is a need for service providers to provide WMM/WRC to inbound roamers without involving network elements of the roaming subscriber's HPMN.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Systems and methods are provided herein that transfer Welcome Multimedia Messages ("MM") ("WMM") or Welcome Roaming Content ("WRC") to devices of inbound roamers. These systems and methods, collectively referred to herein as Inbound Roamer Multimedia Messaging Systems ("IRMMS"), transfer MMs to inbound roamers without involving components of the corresponding HPMN. The<br><br>
MMs include text messages, music clips, voice clips, video clips, photographs, and drawings, but are not so limited. Use of the IRMMS eliminates payment by a VPMN with which a subscriber is roaming to the subscriber's HPMN. The payment is eliminated because components of the HPMN (GGSN, WAP Gateway, MMSC, etc.) are not included in the transfer of the MMs by the VPMN to the subscriber's device. Thus, the charges typically incurred by the VPMN for transmission of free WMM/WRC sent to the inbound roamer via the HPMN are avoided.<br>
The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding of, and enabling description for, embodiments of the IRMMS. However, one skilled hi the art will understand that the IRMMS may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments of the IRMMS.<br>
Terms such as handset, mobile station ("MS"), subscriber, user, etc., may herein be used interchangeably to indicate an actor that is registering with a network. These terms are used for convenience, but hi fact, the actor that registers with the network could be any combination of hardware and software capable of registering on a wireless network, e.g., a personal digital assistant C*PDA") and/or personal computer ("PC").<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram of a communication system 100 that includes a VPMN that transfers MMs to inbound roomers 10 without involving components of the roamer's HPMN, under an embodiment. The subscriber 10 is a "home" subscriber from the perspective of the HPMN network operator. The subscriber 10 uses a handset or mobile device that communicates over a wireless network 30 with the VPMN through a number of components as appropriate to the network 30. The VPMN of an embodiment includes an Intelligent Roaming Probe ("IRB") that monitors various roaming links and detects inbound roamers. The VPMN also includes a Visited Mobile Switch Center ("VMSC"), a Multimedia Mobile Switching Center ("MMSC"), a Serving General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS") Support Node ("SGSN"), and a Wireless Application Protocol ("WAP") Gateway. The VPMN may also include one or more of a GMSC-V, an IRMG, a Signal Gateway ("SG"), a Home Location Register ("HLR-V"), and a Visited Location Register ("VLR-V") (not shown) to name a few.<br><br>
The HUB of an embodiment is not limited to being hosted at the VPMN. Consequently, the communication system 100 of various alternative embodiments may include an IRB associated with at least one of the VPMN, the HPMN, and components of the network 10. Furthermore, the communication system 100 of various alternative embodiments may distribute functions of the IRB across one or more components of at least one of the VPMN, the HPMN, and the network 10.<br>
The MMSC provides a store and forward facility for multimedia messages sent across a mobile network. The MMSC may also provide a formatting role to enable messages to be "optimized" to the receiving handsets capability.<br>
The HPMN of an embodiment includes for example a Home Location Register ("HLR") along with a Gateway General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS") Support Node ("GGSN")- The HPMN of an embodiment may also include one or more of a GMSC-H, a Multimedia Mobile Switch Center C'MMSC"), an IRMG, a Signal Gateway ("SG"), an HLR-H, a VMSC-H, and a VLR-H (not shown).<br>
Components of the VPMN and HPMN are coupled to communicate via one or<br>
i	i<br>
more networks 20 that include for example an SS7 signaling network ("SS7<br>
network"). The SS7 signaling is a Common Channel Signaling ("CCS") system defined by the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector ("ITU-T")- The SS7 signaling is used in telecommunication networks and provides a suite of protocols which enables circuit and non circuit related information to be routed about and between networks. The protocols of SS7 signaling include but are not limited to Message Transfer Part ("MTP"), Signaling Connection Control Part ("SCCP"), and Integrated Service Digital Network ("ISDN") User Part ("ISUP").<br>
The network 20 and/or network 30 may include service provider networks that include, for example, GSM service and/or other cellular service, VoIP service, and/or WiFi service, but the embodiment is not so limited. The VPMN couples to each of the networks 20 and 30 for information exchange via network or bus couplings as appropriate to the network type, where the couplings include at least one of wireless, wired, and hybrid wireless/wired couplings/connections. Further, the networks/network couplings can include any of a number of network types known hi the art including, but not limited to, local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), proprietary networks, backend networks, and the Internet<br><br>
1 The mobile devices 10 described herein include, for example, cellular telephones, PCs, portable computing devices, portable telephones, portable communication devices, subscriber devices or units, and PDAs. The mobile devices 10, which also may be referred to as "mobile communication devices," "portable communication devices" and "communication devices," can include all such devices and equivalents, and are not limited to communication devices that are wireless. The networks 20 and 30 described herein support the transfer of information including voice and data signals between the mobile devices and the operator or service provider systems via at least one of wireless couplings, wired couplings, and a combination of wireless/wired couplings using one or more communication protocols known in the art. The networks described herein can use at least one of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Time Division Multiple Access CTDMA) communication protocols, for example, but are not so limited.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the VPMN of an embodiment transfers or sends WMM/WRC to the inbound roamer at such time as the inbound roamer registers with the VPMN network. Based on the roamer's GPRS subscription information with respect to the VPMN network and the VPMN deployment option, the IRMMS of an embodiment supports provision of WMM/WRC to the inbound roamer under three scenarios but is not so limited.<br>
Under a first scenario, the VPMN detects that the roamer has a GPRS roaming subscription and a MMS/WAP-push capable handset The VPMN, in response, sends a WMM/WRC to the subscriber's handset via WAP push. The message is then retrieved by the handset.<br>
Under a second scenario, the VPMN detects the roamer has a GPRS subscription and a MMS/WAP-push capable handset but no GPRS roaming relationship. The VPMN then transfers MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations to the handset via Over-The-Air ("OTA") provisioning ("OTAP") or configuration. The MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations configure the receiving handset to access WAP services over GPRS and to send/receive MMS messages. The VPMN then sends the roamer a WMM/WRC via WAP push. The message is men retrieved by the handset<br>
The MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations are provided by the IRB of an embodiment because, in order for mobile phone users to access services such as WAP, GPRS, and/or MMS on their provider's wireless network (HPMN), their<br><br>
handsets must first be configured with the required settings to enable access to the service. This information can be entered manually into the phone, but this is a complex process and the information being entered is very technical, making the entry of this data difficult and prone to error. The OTAP provides a mechanism for mobile phones to be configured via special binary SMS messages sent to the handset for example.<br>
Under a third scenario, the VPMN detects the roamer has no GPRS subscription but does have a MMS/WAP-push capable handset The VPMN then transfers MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations to the handset via OTAP. The VPMN then sends the roamer WMM/WRC via WAP push. The message is then retrieved by the handset<br>
Under any of the first, second, and third scenarios, the VPMN may, in response to detecting the roamer, send an MMS alert if the handset is only MMS capable. The VPMN may, in response to detecting the roamer, send a WAP push alert if the handset is only WAP-push capable.<br>
The MM provided to the handset by the VPMN can include, for example, a city map, a local information guide, a local music download site, a ring-tone download site, and anything that is offered via the internet The roaming subscriber can navigate through information of the MM to retrieve further information. Roamers will not be charged for the first MM, however subsequent clicks on the MM content can be charged. Inbound roomers will be alerted if such charges are applied against their accounts.<br>
The value proposition of the IRMMS for service providers or operators is the attraction of inbound roamers to their network with better service and content and the ability to charge the roamer for the subsequent URL usage. The operator can also charge the advertisers or sponsors for the MMS or content service. The value proposition to inbound roamers is that they get access to rich multimedia local content such as city guide, restaurant information, service guides, etc.<br>
The IRMMS of an embodiment generally supports inbound roamers using the IRB deployed at the VPMN operator for example. The 1KB monitors the roaming links of the VPMN for MAP transactions. The IRB intercepts GPRS roaming signaling messages and GPRS data packet messages so as to control select GPRS traffic on the VPMN without involving HPMN network elements.<br><br>
When an inbound roamer registers at the VPMN operator, for example, the registration is detected by the 1KB, and the 1KB captures information of the registering roamer from various MAP transaction messages (e.g., LUP, ISD, CancelLoc, PurgeMS, RestoreData, etc.). The 1KB in response issues UpdateGPRSLocation messages to check for the roamer's GPRS subscription status (if not available in cached information). The UpdateGPRSLocation message may have been monitored at the roaming links if the roaming device initiates itself, in which case the information will be stored hi the cache. In so doing the IRB presents as an SGSN node on the SS7 side although the IRB has no GPRS packet capability.<br>
The IRB of an embodiment may perform GPRS packet interception using a number of methods. For example, the IRB may use GPRS Tunnelling Protocol on the Gn interface (a GPRS interface located between the GPRS Support Nodes ("GSN")) and Gp interface (when the GGSN and the SGSN are located hi different networks, they may be interconnected via the Gp interface, which provides similar functionality to that of the Gn interface, however the Gp interface includes extra security functionality based on mutual agreements between operators) in order to tunnel user data between different GSNs. The IRB of an embodiment supports both signalling and user data under one generic header and can be used with User Datagram Protocol ("UDP") or Transmission Control Protocol ("TCP") but is not so limited.<br>
Depending on GPRS subscription status of an inbound roamer and the operator's deployment options, the IRB may use different approaches to provide the WMM/WRC and to support the corresponding billing to the receiving subscriber. As described above, these approaches include three scenarios under which the IRMMS supports provision of WMM/WRC to inbound roamers. Each of these scenarios is described below in turn.<br>
The IRB of an embodiment supports provision of WMM/WRC to inbound roamers upon detecting that the roamer has a GPRS roaming subscription and a MMS/WAP-push capable handset. Figure 2 is a signal flow diagram 200 for providing WMM/WRC to inbound roamers, under an embodiment. With further reference to the host communication system 100, when the roamer has a GPRS subscription and is allowed to do GPRS roaming at the VPMN, a WAP push alert for the UA profile is sent to the handset by the IRB. This serves as a request for the handset to forward or send the handset device profile (URL) to the IRB. The handset responds with the UA-profile (URL) to indicate handset capabilities to the IRB. Since<br><br>
the UA profile is provided using the GPRS configuration (e.g., APN) and the WAP gateway information (e.g., home WAP gateway IP address) already in the handset after GPRS attach is successful, a create PDF context message (e.g., GPRS Tunneling Protocol-Control ("GTP-C") message) is established with the HPMN GGSN. This context creation message and subsequent PDF messages from the handset to the HPMN GGSN are intercepted by the IRB based on the GTP-C message at port 2123 and GPRS Tunneling Protocol-User ("GTP-U") message at port 2152 for version 1 GTP. In an embodiment in which version 0 GTP is used, then PDF messages on port 3386 are examined to separate GTP-C messages from GTP-U messages.<br>
In describing GPRS-attach, in GPRS the mobile device is permanently attached to the network, providing a virtual connection without cost and data transfer (GPRS-Attach). The GPRS attach procedure is executed whenever a GPRS enabled MS is powered on and needs to inform the network about its presence. The two peers of a GPRS attach procedure are the MS and the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). Depending on the availability of the packet Common Control Channel (PCCCH), the GPRS attach procedure may be executed on Circuit Common Control Channel (CCCCH).<br>
The GTP-C messages are control plane messages exchanged between GSNs in a signal path. The control plane messages are used to transfer GSN capability information between GSN pairs, to create, update and delete GTP tunnels and for path management.<br>
The GTP-U messages are user plane messages exchanged between GSN pairs or GSN/Radio Network Controller ("RNC") pairs in a signal path. The user plane messages are used to carry user data packets and signaling messages for path management and error indication.<br>
As an example, the IRB intercepts the PDF session and relays information to the HPMN GGSN for those packets for which the VPMN intends to charge, while mimicking the HPMN GGSN to intercept the packets or URLs that were offered to the roamer for free. The IRB of an embodiment therefore does not mimic the GGSN in order to stop PDF context creation at the HPMN GGSN because there is no way to determine at the time of context creation whether the context creation is triggered by the roamer or by the WMM/WRC. Also, the WMM/WRC might also ride on the existing GPRS session. Furthermore, the VPMN may only intend to offer free<br><br>
content to the roamer on the first content selection while charging fees to the roamer for subsequent access to content.<br>
From the GTP-U message, WAP messages within the GTP tunnel at port 9201 (weak security, WAP access mode) are further examined. From GTP-C message, when the PDP context creation messages are intercepted by the IRB, the IRB also records information that includes but is not limited to at least one of the tunnel ID, charging ID, MSI, NSAPI, and HPMN GGSN IP address for later use.<br>
When the UA profile of the handset indicates 'an MMS-capable handset, the IRB sends a MMS alert via PAP through a WAP push gateway to the handset. Since the push is an SLA request for a confirmed push, the handset response will include a GPRS attachment and PDP context activation. The data of the response again gets intercepted by the IRB. If the handset initiates MMS-retrieval of the MMS message, the request will reach the IRB which can tiien fetch the MMS content from MMSC or MMS content server. The IRB will then return the MMS message back to the handset.<br>
If the handset UA profile does not indicate an MMS-capable handset, the IRB can send a WAP push URL instead. In this manner, the roamer can browse through a wireless markup language ("WML") menu with MMS-like content in the interaction.<br>
When PDP messages are intercepted by the IRB, the IRB of an embodiment checks the URL of the message. The IRB maintains a list of URLs ("free list") to which access is free and without charge for the inbound roamers. If the intercepted URL is from the free list, then the IRB handles the request without sending the message to the HPMN GGSN. In this way, the HPMN GGSN will not have the billing record for this transaction. The IRB uses the previous information recorded on the tunnel ID and mimics the source IP address to be that of the HPMN GGSN address when returning PDP messages back to the VPMN SGSN. In this manner, even if the SGSN has built-in security checks on the HPMN GGSN, it is addressed properly.<br>
The IRB of an embodiment supports provision of WMM/WRC to inbound roamers upon detecting that the roamer has a GPRS roaming subscription and a MMS/WAP-push capable handset but is without a GPRS roaming relationship between the HPMN and the VPMN. Figure 3 is a signal flow diagram 300 for providing WMM/WRC to inbound roamers in the absence of a GPRS roaming relationship, under an embodiment. Under this scenario, the VPMN detects the<br><br>
roamer has a GPRS subscription and a MMS/WAP-push capable handset but no GPRS roaming relationship. The VPMN in turn transfers MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations to the handset via OTAP. The VPMN then sends the roamer a WMM/WRC via WAP push. The message is then retrieved by the handset.<br>
With reference to the host communication system 100 along with the signal flow diagram 300, the roamer has a GPRS subscription but in the absence of a GPRS roaming relationship is not allowed to perform GPRS roaming between the HPMN and VPMN. The VPMN of an embodiment, while allowing postpaid voice roaming, also offers GPRS roaming to inbound roamers from the HPMN in the absence of GPRS roaming relationships by allowing the VPMN to access the VPMN GPRS service. The VPMN provides this GPRS roaming by using the IRB to intercept the GPRS attach to allow VPMN access and a wild card Access Point Name ("APN") in the VPMN SGSN.<br>
The VPMN operator's SGSN defines the APN to provide internet service and thus VPMN access for inbound roamers. This APN operates to select a VPMN GGSN using a Domain Name System ("DNS") &amp;r internet access. The APN provides routing information for SGSNs and GGSNs. The APN comprises two components including the network identification ("ID"), which identifies the external service requested by a use of the GPRS service, and the operator ID which specifies routing information.<br>
The IRB also sends a WAP push alert to the handset for the UA profile, the alert requesting forwarding of the handset device profile URL to the IRB. The handset responds by forwarding the UA-profile URL to the IRB to indicate handset capabilities to the IRB. Since the UA profile is provided using the GPRS configuration (e.g., HPMN APN) and WAP gateway (e.g. HPMN WAP gateway IP address) information already in the handset after GPRS attach is successful, when the PDF context activation message is sent by the handset to the VPMN SGSN, the VPMN SGSN maps the APN to the VPMN GGSN.<br>
Since the URL points to the IRB, the IP content will reach the IRB from the VPMN GGSN. There is no need to change any EP address or intercept PDF messages because the IRB is transparent to the GPRS transport.<br>
The GPRS billing of an embodiment is done differently from GPRS TAP because the roamer's HPMN has no GPRS roaming relationships with the VPMN. The billing therefore includes filtering of the GPRS Call Detail Record ("CDR")<br><br>
using information of the roaming International Mobile Subscriber Identifier ("IMSI") with the Mobile Country Code ("MCC") and Mobile Network Code ("MNC") belonging to the HPMNs that do not have a GPRS roaming relationship with the VPMN.<br>
The CDR is a database record unit used to create billing records. The CDR includes details such as the called and calling parties, originating switch, terminating switch, call length, and time of day. When applied to GPRS, CDRs are typically generated by the SGSN and GGSN, recording data volumes and Quality of Service ("QoS") rather than call time. These records are passed to the Charging Gateway Function ("CGF") for consolidation prior to being passed to the billing platform.<br>
The IRB of an embodiment supports provision of WMM/WRC to inbound roamers upon detecting that the roamer has a MMS/WAP-push capable handset but is without a GPRS roaming subscription. Figure 4 is a signal flow diagram 400 for providing WMM/WRC to inbound roamers hi the absence of a GPRS roaming subscription, under an embodiment. Under this scenario, the VPMN detects the roamer has no GPRS subscription but does have a MMS/WAP-push capable handset. The VPMN then transfers MMS/WAP/GPRS configurations to the handset via OTAP. The VPMN then sends the roamer WMM/WRC via WAP push. The message is then retrieved by the handset.<br>
With reference to the host communication system 100 and the signal flow diagram 400, the roamer does not have a GPRS subscription but does have postpaid voice roaming. The VPMN offers GPRS roaming to inbound roamers without GPRS roamhig relationships, when the VPMN can provide International Mobile Equipment Identity ("IMEI") information (e.g., through Equipment Identity Register ("EIR"), through probing at the Abis interface (interface between the Base Transceiver Station ("BTS") and Base Station Controller ("BSC")), Gb interface (GPRS interface located between the SGSN and the Packet Control Unit ("PCU"), and/or through SGSN), by causing the IRB to transfer to the roamer's handset via an OTA coupling the GPRS configuration of a VPMN APN and the MMS/WAP configuration of a VPMN. The OTAP of the VPMN setting may not be used when the roamer has a GPRS subscription since this may deactivate the roamer's existing configurations which must be subsequently reset<br>
Because the OTAP depends on device recognition, there is no need for WAP push of the UA-profile request. Instead after the OTAP as described above, a WAP<br><br>
push alert for WMM/WRC or MMS alert is sent to the handset by the 1KB. This WAP push alert requests the handset to acknowledge ("ack"). The handset responds to the ack using the VPMN GPRS configuration (e.g., APN) and WAP gateway (e.g., VPMN WAP gateway IP address) information already in the handset following the GPRS attach. The IRB of an embodiment intercepts the GPRS attach to allow VPMN access and a wild card APN in the VPMN SGSN. When the PDP context activation message is subsequently sent by the handset to the VPMN SGSN, the VPMN SGSN maps the APN to the VPMN GGSN. The IP/MMS content reaches the IRB from the VPMN GGSN because the MMS or WAP push URL is pointed to the IRB. Thus, there is no need to change any IP address or intercept PDP messages because the IRB is transparent to the GPRS transport<br>
In alternative embodiments, the OTAP described above can also be apph'ed to inbound roamers that do not have GPRS roaming but that have a GPRS roaming relationship with the HPMN and VPMN.<br>
For inbound roamers using GPRS roaming, the SGSN produces billing records for every roaming session. Since portions of the session's data volume may be provided free of charge, every roaming IMSI associated with an HPMN APN is examined to see if it includes free data content, and removes the free data content to generate the final GPRS CDR for TAP processing.<br>
Regarding billing for inbound roamers having a GPRS subscription and GPRS roaming relationships between the HPMN and VPMN, the SGSN generates billing records for the GPRS sessions. The billing system or mediation system recognizes the reamer's IMSI (based on MCC and MNC) of these records as belonging to that of a non-GPRS inbound roamer. Once recognized, these records are billed in a special manner by the VPMN and are not billed by the normal MO-TAP for GPRS.<br>
For inbound roamers without a GPRS subscription, when OTAP is used, the billing system or mediation system recognizes a record as belonging to that of special GPRS inbound roamers by looking at the VPMN APN. Once recognized, these records will not be billed by the normal MO-TAP for GPRS and are instead billed in a special manner by the VPMN.<br>
The VPMN operator can bill the usage as a daily flat fee and send a value added service EVENT TAP record to the HPMN operator of the non-GPRS inbound roamer. The VPMN may also use the GPRS session time and bill it as a CSD duration.<br><br>
Referring again to Figures 1-4 described above, the SGSN selects the APN for use in deriving the GGSN address, and sets the selection mode parameter according to a number of selection rules. Figures 5-10 are Specification and Description Language ("SDL") diagrams for selection rules used to set the selection mode parameter, under an embodiment. These rules are applied upon PDF context activation to determine the APN and the corresponding GGSN in the GPRS specification 360. SDL is an object-oriented, formal language defined by the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications Standardization Sector ("ITU-T"). The language is intended for the specification of complex, event driven, real time, and interactive applications involving many concurrent activities that communicate using discrete signals. The definitions that follow apply to the selection rules but the embodiment is not so limited.<br>
The SGSN may know from the subscription data the parameters (S for Subscribed) that include PDF type (S), POP address (S), APN (S), and VPLMN address allowed.<br>
The SGSN may know from configuration the default APN supporting a given PDP type. This APN is called APN (SGSN) and does not include an APN Operator Identifier.<br>
The SGSN knows the parameters requested by the MS (R for Requested) including PDP type (R), PDP address (R), and APN (R). APN (R) is the APN Network Identifier requested by the MS.<br>
In case of "an APN chosen by the SGSN" the activated PDP context is linked with a dynamic PDP address.<br>
An MS may have multiple subscription records for the same PDP type and the same PDP address, but with different APNs. An MS may have one or two subscription records with the same PDP type and the same APN, where one record has a static PDP address and one record has a dynamic PDP address.<br>
When the MS is in its Home Public Land Mobile Network ("HPLMN"), and the MS requests an APN that does not correspond to any GGSN of the HPLMN, the request is rejected by the SGSN. When the MS is in a Visited Public Land Mobile Network ("VPLMN"), and the MS requests an APN that does not correspond to any GGSN of its HPLMN, the VPLMN, and any associated PLMN when the VPLMN is a shared network, the request is rejected by the SGSN.<br><br>
If APN (S) = wild card (see GSM 03.03), then: (a) a default APN (a default PDN) is to be chosen by the SGSN (APN (SGSN)) if no APN (R) has been provided; or (b) a PDP context with dynamic PDP address may be activated towards any APN requested by the MS.<br>
In order to derive APN (R) from the APN sent by the MS, the SGSN determines if the APN sent by the user ends with ".gprs". If not, then APN (R) is equal to APN sent by the MS. If yes, then APN (R) is the APN sent by the MS without the three last labels. When the APN sent by the user ends with ".gprs" then the APN-OI is saved for later use.<br>
