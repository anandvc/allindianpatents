2-METHYLMORPHOLINE   PYRIDO-,PYRAZO-   AND   PYRIMIDO-PYRIMIDINE   DERIVATIVES  AS   MTOR INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which act as mTOR inhibitors, their use<br>
and their synthesis.<br>
Background<br>
5	Growth factor/mitogenic activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT<br>
signalling pathway ultimately leads to the key cell cycle and growth control regulator mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin (alternatively referred to as FRAP (FKBP12 and rapamycin associated protein), RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1), RAPT1 (rapamycin target 1) - all derived from the interaction with the FK-506-binding protein FKBP12, and SEP<br>
10 (sirolimus effector protein)). mTOR is a mammalian serine/threonine kinase of approximately 289 kDa in size and a member of the evolutionary conserved eukaryotic TOR kinases (refs. 1-4). The mTOR protein is a member of the PB-kinase like kinase (PUCK) family of proteins due to its C-terminal homology (catalytic domain) with PI3-kinase and the other family members, e.g. DNA-PKcs (DNA dependent protein kinase), ATM (Ataxia-<br>
15 telangiectasia mutated). In addition to a catalytic domain in the C-terminus, mTOR contains a FKBP12/rapamycin complex binding domain (FRB). At the N-terminus up to 20 HEAT (Huntingtin, EF3, alpha regulatory subunit of PP2A and TOR.) motifs are found whilst more C-terminal is a FAT (FRAP-ATM-TRRAP) domain, and at the extreme C-terminus of the protein an additional FAT domain is found (FAT-C) (refs. 5,6).<br>
20	TOR has been identified as a central regulator of both cell growth (size) and<br>
proliferation, which is in part governed by translation initiation. TOR dependant phosphorylation of S6-kinase (S6K1) allows translation of ribosomal proteins involved in cell cycle progression (refs. 7-9). Cap-dependant translation is regulated by the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1 (PHAS-<br>
25 1)). This modification prevents PHAS-1 binding eIF4E, thereby permitting formation of an active eIF4F translation complex (reviewed in refs. 10,11,12). Activation of these signalling elements is dependant on insulin, other growth factors and nutrients suggesting a gatekeeper role for mTOR in the control of cell cycle progression only under favourable environmental conditions.   The PI3K/AKT signalling cascade lies upstream of mTOR and this has been<br>
30 shown to be deregulated in certain cancers and results in growth factor independent activation in, for example, PTEN deficient cells. mTOR lies at the axis of control for this pathway and inhibitors of this kinase (e.g. sirolimus (rapamycin or Rapamune™) and everolimus (RAD001<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2OO7/003179<br><br>
or Certican ' )) are already approved for immunosuppression and drug eluting stents (reviewed in refs. 13f 14), and are now receiving particular interest as novel agents for cancer treatment.<br>
Tumour cell growth arises from the deregulation of normal growth control 5 mechanisms such as the loss of tumour suppressor function(s). One such tumour suppressor is the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome ten (PTEN). This gene, also known as mutated in multiple advanced cancers (MMAC), has been shown to play a significant role in cell cycle arrest and is the most highly mutated tumour suppressor after p53. Up to 30% of glioblastoma, endometrial and prostate cancers have somatic mutations or<br>
10  deletions of this locus (refs. 15,16).<br>
PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5, bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5, triphosphate (PIP3) whilst PTEN is responsible for removing the 33 phosphate from PEP3 producing PTP2. PI3-K and PTEN act to maintain an appropriate level of PIP3 which recruits and thus activates AKT (also known as PKB) and the downstream signalling cascade<br>
15 that is then initiated. In the absence of PTEN, there is inappropriate regulation of this cascade, AKT becomes effectively constitutively activated and cell growth is deregulated. An alternative mechanism for the deregulation of this cell signalling process is the recent identification of a mutant form of the PI3K isoform, pllOalpha (ref. 17). The apparent increased activity of this mutant is thought to result in increased PIP3 production, presumably<br>
20 in excess of that which the function of PTEN can counteract. Increased signalling from PI3K, thus results in increased signalling to mTOR and consequently, its downstream activators.<br>
In addition to the evidence linking mTOR with cell cycle regulation (from Gl to S-phase) and that inhibition of mTOR results in inhibition of these regulatory events it has been shown that down regulation of mTOR activity results in cell growth inhibition (Reviewed in<br>
25 refs. 7,18,19). The known inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, potently inhibits proliferation or growth of cells derived from a range of tissue types such as smooth muscle, T-cells as well as cells derived from a diverse range of tumour types including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma and meduUoblastoma, small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, pancreatic carcinoma and breast and prostate carcinoma (reviewed in ref. 20). Rapamycin has<br>
30 been approved and is in clinical use as an immunosuppressant, its prevention of organ rejection being successful and with fewer side effects than previous therapies (refs. 20, 21). Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin and its analogues (RAD001, CCI-779) is brought about by<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003I79<br><br>
the prior interaction of the drug with the FK506 binding protein, FKBP12. Subsequently, the complex of FKBP12/rapamycin then binds to the FRB domain of mTOR and inhibits the downstream signalling from mTOR.<br>
The potent but non-specific inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin, also have 5 been shown to inhibit the kinase function of mTOR but act through targeting the catalytic domain of the protein (ref 21). Further to the inhibition of mTOR function by small molecules targeted to the kinase domain, it has been demonstrated that kinase dead mTOR cannot transmit the upstream activating signals to the downstream effectors of mTOR, PHAS-1 or p70S6 kinase (ref. 22).  It is also shown that not all functions of mTOR are rapamycin<br>
10 sensitive and this may be related to the observation that rapamycin alters the substrate profile of mTOR rather than inhibiting its activity per se (ref. 23). Analysis of the interactions of mTOR with other cellular factors has revealed that in addition to the mTOR-Raptor complex, there is also an mTOR-Rictor complex representing a rapamycin insensitive activity of mTOR (B) (Sarbassov et al Current Biology, 2004, 14, 1296-1302). This activity likely accounts for<br>
15 the discrepancy between kinase dead mTOR and the alteration of mTOR signalling by rapamycin and its derivatives. The discrepancy also identifies the possibility of a therapeutic advantage in inhibiting directly the catalytic activity of mTOR. It has been suggested that a catalytic inhibitor of mTOR may be a more effective antagonist of cancer cell proliferation and survival and that rapamycin may be more useful in combination with agents that can<br>
20 compensate for its failure to completely disrupt pathway signalling (Choo and Blenis, Cancer Cell, 2006, 9, 77-79; Hay, Cancer Cell, 2005, 8, 179-183). Therefore, it is proposed that a kinase domain directed inhibitor of mTOR may be a more effective inhibitor of mTOR.<br>
In addition to rapamycin's ability to induce growth inhibition (cytostasis) in its own right, rapamycin and its derivatives have been shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity of a<br>
25 number of chemotherapies including cisplatin, camptothecin and doxorubicin (reviewed in ref. 20). Potentiation of ionising radiation induced cell killing has also been observed following inhibition of mTOR (ref. 24). Experimental and clinical evidence has shown that rapamycin analogues are showing evidence of efficacy in treating cancer, either alone or in combination with other therapies (see refs.  10,  18, 20).    These findings suggest that<br>
30 pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR kinase should be of therapeutic value for treatment of the various forms of cancer comprising solid tumours such as carcinomas and sarcomas and the leukaemias and lymphoid malignancies. In particular, inhibitors of mTOR kinase should<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
be of therapeutic value for treatment of, for example, cancer of the breast, colorectum, lung (including small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and bronchioalveolar cancer) and prostate, and of cancer of the bile duct, bone, bladder, head and neck, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tissue, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, skin, testes, thyroid, uterus, cervix and 5  vulva, and of leukaemias (including ALL and CML), multiple myeloma and lymphomas.<br>
Renal cell carcinoma in particular, has been identified as sensitive to the rapamycin derivative CCI-779, resulting from a loss of VHL expression (Thomas et al Nature Medicine, 2006, 12, 122-127). Tumours that have lost the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) tumour suppressor, have also been shown to be sensitive to inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin as a<br>
10 consequence of disruption of the regulation of the mTOR signalling pathway (Bernadi, Nature, 2006,442, 779-785) and the use of an mTOR kinase inhibitor in these diseases should be of therapeutic value. These latter examples in addition to those of PTEN deficiency or PI3K mutation indicate where a targeted approach to the use of mTOR inihibitors may prove particularly effective due to an underlying genetic profile, but are not considered to be<br>
15   exclusive targets.<br>
Recent studies have revealed a role for mTOR kinase in other diseases (Easton &amp; Houghton, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets, 2004, 8, 551-564). Rapamycin has been demonstrated to be a potent immunosuppressant by inhibiting antigen-induced proliferation of T cells, B cells and antibody production (Sehgal, Transplantation Proceedings, 2003, 35, 7S-<br>
20 14S) and thus mTOR kinase inhibitors may also be useful immunosuppressives. Inhibition of the kinase activity of mTOR may also be useful in the prevention of restenosis, that is the control of undesired proliferation of normal cells in the vasculature in response to the introduction of stents in the treatment of vasculature disease (Morice et al., New England Journal of Medicine, 2002, 346,  1773-1780).    Furthermore,  the Rapamycin analogue,<br>
25 everolimus, can reduce the severity and incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (Eisen el a;., New England Journal of Medicine, 2003, 349, 847-858). Elevated mTOR kinase activity has been associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which is of clinical importance as a major risk factor for heart failure and is a consequence of increased cellular size of cardiomyocytcs (Tee &amp; Blenis, Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2005, 16, 29-37).   Thus mTOR<br>
30 kinase inhibitors are expected to be of value in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of diseases in addition to cancer.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003171)<br><br>
The vast majority of mTOR pharmacology to date has focused on inhibition of mTOR via rapamycin or its analogues. However, as noted above, the only non-rapamycin agents that have been reported to inhibit mTOR's activity via a kinase domain targetted mechanism are the small molecule LY294002 and the natural product wortmannin (ref. 21). 5   Summary of the Invention<br>

25   (or "isomeric forms").<br>
If the compound is in crystalline form, it may exist in a number of different polymorphic   ' forms. For example, for Example la was isolated as Form A: 2-Theta° 6.9 (46%), 8.53 (100%), 10.1 (21%), 10.86 (24%), 11.65 (11%), 13.31 (14%), 13.75 (7%), 14.37 (54%), 15.21 (5%), 16.19 (13%), 16.81 (39%), 17.19 (40%), 17.97 (21%), 18.41 (65%), 18.78 (80%), 20.66<br>

Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers<br>
10 which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.   However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally<br>
15 isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., C1.7 alkyl includes «-propyl and wo-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, cnol-, and   enolate-forms,   as   in,   for   example,   the   following   tautomeric   pairs:   keto/enol,<br>
20 imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 'H, 2H (D), and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, l3C, and l4C; O may be in any isotopic<br>
25  form, including l60 and I80; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily<br>
30  obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below, as well as its different polymorphic forms.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding 5  salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.   Examples of ■ pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are discussed in ref. 25.<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such<br>
10 as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Al3+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e.., NH4+) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR44). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine,       tri ethyl amine,      butylamine,      ethylenediamine,      ethanolamine.<br>
15 diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g., -NH2 may be -NH3"*), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable<br>
20 inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous. Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: acetic, propionic, succinic, gycolic, stearic, palmitic, lactic, malic, pamoic, tartaric, citric, gluconic, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic,<br>
25 phenylacetic, glutamic, aspartic, benzoic, cinnamic, pyruvic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-ace tyoxy benzoic, fiimaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane sulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, valeric, and gluconic. Examples of suitable polymeric anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
30	It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding,<br>
solvate of the active compound. The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2(in7/0«3179<br><br>
If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form," as used 5 herein, pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions, that is, are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be<br>
10 removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, ref. 26.<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a /-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenyhnethyl) ether; a trimethylsiiyl or /-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester<br>
15   (-OC(=0)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
20	For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide or a<br>
urethane, for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2CfiH4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilyIethyloxy amide (-<br>
25 NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsuIphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases, as an iV-oxide (&gt;NO).<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1.7 alkyl ester (e.g. a methyl ester; a /-butyl ester); a C1-.7 haloalkyl ester (e.g. a C1-7<br>
30 trihaloalkyl ester); a triCi-7 alkyIsilyl-Ci.7 alkyl ester; or a C5.20 aryl-C1-7 aikyl ester (e.g. a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a<br>
benzyl thioether; an acetamidornethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=0)CH3).<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active<br>
compound in the form of a prodrug.   The term "prodrug", as used herein, pertains to a 5   compound which, when metabolised (e.g. in vivo), yields the desired active compound.<br>
Typically, the prodrug is inactive, or less active than the active compound, but may provide<br>
advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties.<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g. a physiologically<br>
acceptable metabolically labile ester).   During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=0)OR) is 10  cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of<br>
any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound, with, where<br>
appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound,<br>
followed by deprotection if required.   Examples of such metabolically labile esters include<br>
those wherein R is C1-20 alkyl (e.g. -Me, -Et); C1-7 aminoalkyl (e.g. aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-15   diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and acyloxy-Ci-7 alkyl  (e.g.  acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxyethyl;   e.g.   pivaloyloxymethyl;   acetoxymethyl;   1-acetoxyethyl;   l-(l-methoxy-l-<br>
methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl;      l-(benzoyloxy)ethyl;      isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl;	cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;	1-cyclohexyl-<br>
carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl; l-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl; (4-20  tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl; l-(4-terrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyIoxyethyl; (4-<br>
tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and 1 -(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Further suitable prodrug forms include phosphonate and glycolate salts. In particular,<br>
hydroxy   groups   (-Orl),   can  be   made   into  phosphonate  prodrugs   by  reaction  with<br>
chlorodibenzylphosphite, followed by hydrogenation, to form a phosphonate group -O-25  P(=0)(OH)2.   Such a group can be cleared by phosphotase enzymes during metabolism to<br>
yield the active drug with the hydroxy group.<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a<br>
compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound. For example.<br>
the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid 30  ester derivative.<br><br>

The present invention provides active compounds, specifically, active in inhibiting the activity of mTOR.<br>
The term "active" as used herein, pertains to compounds which are capable of inhibiting mTOR activity, and specifically includes both compounds with intrinsic activity 10  (drugs) as well as prodrugs of such compounds, which prodrugs may themselves exhibit little or no intrinsic activity.<br>
One assay which may. conveniently be used in order to assess the mTOR inhibition offered by a particular compound is described in the examples below.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of inhibiting the activity of mTOR in 15   a cell, comprising contacting said cell with an effective amount of an active compound, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. Such a method may be practised in vitro or in vivo.<br>
For example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and an active compound brought<br>
into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed.   As<br>
20  examples of "effect", the inhibition of cellular growth in a certain time or the accumulation of<br>
cells in the Gl phase of the cell cycle over a certain time may be determined.   Where the<br>
active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be used as a prognostic<br><br>

Administration<br>
10	The active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound<br>
may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/ peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g.<br>
15 through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.<br>
20	The subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent<br>
(e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human. Formulations<br>
25	While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable<br>
to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation) comprising at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or<br>
30  prophylactic agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described<br>
herein.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound of formula (I) such as herein described, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent showed unexpected and surprising results. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds,<br>
5 materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical<br>
judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without<br>
excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication,<br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
10	Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical<br>
texts. See, for example, refs. 27 to 29.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or 15 more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
Formulations may be in the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, lozenges, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, suppositories, 20  pessaries,  ointments, gels,. pastes, creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils, boluses, electuaries, or aerosols.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of<br>
the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or<br>
25  non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; as<br>
a bolus; as an electuary; or as a paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or 30 granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica);<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the 5 powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.<br>
10	Formulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular,<br>
buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, past, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Alternatively, a formulation may comprise a patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active compounds and optionally one or more excipients or diluents.<br>
15	Formulations  suitable for topical administration in the mouth include  losenges<br>
comprising the active compound in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active compound in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
20	Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops<br>
wherein the active compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable foT nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500<br>
25 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid for administration as, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebuliser, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active compound.<br>
30	Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an<br>
aerosol  spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichloroiluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration via the skin include ointments, creams, and emulsions. When formulated in an ointment, the active compound may 5 optionally be employed with either a parafflnic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active compounds may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and<br>
10 mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.<br>
When formulated as a topical emulsion, the oily phase may optionally comprise<br>
15 merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it may comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabiliser(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or<br>
20 fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties,<br>
25 since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl<br>
30 myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters.   These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCTYGB2<m7></m7><br>
Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with<br>
a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
5	Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries,<br>
tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, including cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), include aqueous and<br>
10 non-aqueous isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile injection solutions which may contain anti¬oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents, and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to<br>
15 blood components or one or more organs. Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active compound in the solution is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 fig/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 (ig/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example,<br>
20 ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (iyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. Formulations may be in the form of liposomes or other microparticulate systems which  are designed to target the active compound to blood<br>
25  components or one or more organs. Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of<br>
30 tlierapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the 5 dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those 10 of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 {ig to 15  about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day.  Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>
In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, the compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are also useful as pharmacological tools in the 20  development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of mTor in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the search for new therapeutic agents.<br>
In the above other pharmaceutical composition, process, method, use and medicament manufacture features, the alternative and preferred embodiments of the compounds of the 25   invention described herein also apply.<br><br>

To the appropriate amino acid (1 equiv) was added liquid ammonia (sufficient to make a 0.6M solution of substrate in ammonia). The suspension was sealed in a pressure vessel which was then heated slowly to 130 °C. It was noted that at this temperature a pressure of 18<br>
15 bar was observed. This.temperature and pressure was maintained for a further 16 hours whereupon the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The pressure vessel was opened and the reaction poured into ice cold water (1 reaction volume). The resulting solution was acidified to pH 1-2 using concentrated HC1 which caused a precipitate to form. The acidic mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred like this for a further 30<br>

To a 0.3 M solution of amino acid (1 equiv) in anhydrous THF, under an inert atmosphere, was added thionyl chloride (3.3 equiv) in a dropwise fashion. The reaction mixture was 5 stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After this time the reaction was concentrated in vacuo to give a crude yellow solid residue. The crude solid was dissolved in THF (equal to initial reaction volume) and concentrated in vacuo again to give a yellow solid residue. The residue was dissolved once more in THF and concentrated as before to give a solid residue which was then dissolved in THF (to give a solution of 0.3M) and ammonia gas bubbled through the 10 solution for 1 hour.

The HEK293 FLAG-tagged mTOR (1362-2549) stable cell line was routinely maintained at 37°C with 5 % CO2 up to a confluency of 70-90 % in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Limited, Paisley, UK Catalogue No. 41966-029)<br>

Following expression in the mammalian HEK293 cell line, expressed protein was purified using the FLAG epitope tag using standard purification techniques.<br>
20	Test compounds-were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO and diluted into<br>
water as required to give a range of final assay concentrations. Aliquots (2 |xl) of each compound dilution were placed into a well of a Greiner 384-well low volume (LV) white polystyrene plate (Greiner Bio-one).

9206B) and AlphaScreen Streptavidin donor and Protein A acceptor beads (200ng/well Perkin Elmer, Catalogue No. 6760002B and 6760137R respectively). Assay plates were left for approx 16 hours at room temperature before measurement. The resultant signals arising from laser light excitation at 680 nm were measured using a Packard Envision instrument. 5 Phosphorylated biotinylated peptide is formed in situ as a result of mTOR mediated phosphorylation. The phosphorylated biotinylated peptide that is associated with AlphaScreen Streptavidin donor beads forms a complex with the p70 S6 Kinase (T389) 1A5 Monoclonal Antibody that is associated with Alphascreen Protein A acceptor beads. Upon laser light excitation at 680 nm, the donor bead : acceptor bead complex produces a signal that<br>
10  can be measured.   Accordingly, the presence of mTOR kinase activity results in an assay signal. In the presence of an mTOR kinase inhibitor, signal strength is reduced.<br>
Control wells that produced a maximum signal corresponding to maximum enzyme activity were created by using 5 % DMSO instead of test compound. Control wells that produced a minimum signal corresponding to fully inhibited enzyme were created "by adding<br>
15  EDTA (83 mM) instead of test compound.<br>

Example 24<br>
Cell proliferation assay (GISo)<br>
20	Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (A). T47D<br>
(ECACC, 85102201) cells were routinely passaged in RPMI (Invitrogen, 42401018) plus 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS), 1 % L-glutamine (Gibco BRL, 25030) to a confluence not greater than 80 %. To undertake the assay, T47D cells were seeded at 2.5xl03 cells/ well in 90ul RPMT plus 10 % foetal calf serum, 1 % L-glutamine in 96 well plates (Costar, 3904) and<br>
25 incubated at 37°C (+5 % CO2) in a humidified incubator. Once the cells had fully adhered (typically following 4-5 hours incubation) the plate was removed from the incubator and lOuL of the diluent added to the control wells (Al-12 and Bl-12). Compound was prepared in a six point semi-log dilution at lOx the final concentration required e.g. for a 6 point range of 30jiM to lOOnM in semi-log steps dilution started at 300uM in stock plate. Dosing was<br>
30 completed by addition of lOuL of compound at highest concentration to Cl-12 through to the lowest concentration in Hl-12. The plates were then incubated for 120 hours prior to SRB analysis.<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
Upon completion of incubation, media was removed and the cells fixed with 100u.l of ice cold 10 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The plates were incubated at 4QC for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water. Each well of cells was then stained with lOOul of 0.4 % (w/v) SRB (Sulforhodamine B, Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK, Catalogue number S-9012) in 1 5 % acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1 % acetic acid. Plates were then dried for 2 hours at room temperature. The dye from the stained cells was solubilized by the addition of lOOui of lOmM Tris Base into each well. Plates were gently shaken and left at room temperature for 30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564nM on a Microquant microtiter plate reader. The concentration of inhibitor eliciting a 50 % reduction 10 in growth (GI50) was determined by analysis of staining intensity of the treated cells as a percentage of the vehicle control wells using Excelfit software.<br>

30	A  MDA-MB-468  human  breast  adenocarcinoma  cell   line   (LGC   Promochem,<br>
Teddington, Middlesex, UK, Catalogue No. HTB-132) was routinely maintained at 37°C with 5 % C02 up to a confluency of 70-90 % in DMEM containing 10 % heat-inactivated PCS and 1 % L-glutamine.<br><br>

For the assay, the cells were detached from the culture flask using 'Accutase' (Innovative Cell Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA, USA; Catalogue No. AT104) using standard tissue culture methods and resuspended in media to give 1.7x10s cells per ml. Aliquots (90 (il) were seeded into each of the inner 60 wells of a black Packard 96 well plate 5 (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA; Catalogue No. 6005182) to give a density of -15000 cells per well. Aliquots (90 |il) of culture media were placed in the outer wells to prevent edge effects. The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5 % CO2 to allow them to adhere.<br>
On day 2, the cells were treated with test compounds and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with 5 % CO2. Test compounds were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO and<br>
10 serially diluted as required with growth media to give a range of concentrations that were 10-fold the required final test concentrations. Aliquots (10 \i\) of each compound dilution were placed in a well (in triplicate) to give the final required concentrations. As a minimum reponse control, each plate contained wells having a final concentration of 100 uM LY294002 (Calbiochem, Beeston, UK, Catalogue No. 440202).  As a maximum response control, wells<br>
15 contained 1 % DMSO instead of test compound. Following incubation, the contents of the plates were fixed by treatment with a 1.6 % aqueous formaldehyde solution (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK, Catalogue No. F1635) at room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
All subsequent aspiration and wash steps were carried out using a Tecan 96 well plate washer (aspiration speed 10 mm/sec). The fixing solution was removed and the contents<br>
20 of the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 [il; Gibco, Catalogue No. 10010015). The contents of the plates were treated for 10 minutes at room temperature with an aliquot (50 jal) of a cell permeabilisation buffer consisting of a mixture of PBS and 0.5 % Tween-20. The 'permeabilisation' buffer was removed and non-specific binding sites were blocked by treatment for 1 hour at room temperature of an aliquot (50 ul) of a blocking<br>
25 buffer consisting of 5 % dried skimmed milk ['Marvel' (registered trade mark); Premier Beverages, Stafford, GB] in a mixture of PBS and 0.05 % Tween-20. The 'blocking5 buffer was removed and the cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with rabbit anti phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody solution (50 ul per well; Cell Signalling, Hitchin, Herts, U.K., Catalogue No 9277) that had been diluted 1:500 in 'blocking' buffer.   Cells were washed<br>
30 three times in a mixture of PBS and 0.05 % Tween-20. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Alexafluor488 labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (50 p.1 per well; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Limited, Paisley, UK, Catalogue No. All008) that had<br><br>
WO 2008/023161<br><br>
PCT/GB2007/003179<br><br>
been diluted 1:500 in 'blocking' buffer. Cells were washed 3 times with a mixture of PBS and 0.05 % Tween-20. An aliquot of PBS (50 pA) was added to each well and the plates were sealed with black plate sealers and the fluorescence signal was detected and analysed.<br>
Fluorescence dose response data obtained with each compound were analysed and the 5  degree of inhibition of Serine 473 in Akt was expressed as an IC50 value.<br>
