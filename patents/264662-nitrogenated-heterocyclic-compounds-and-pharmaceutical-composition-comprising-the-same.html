NITROGENATED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds having a xanthine oxidase inhibitory effeict and an uricosuric effect and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
The major causes of hyperuricemia are increased production and decreased excretion of uric acid. The former is mainly caused by overproduction of uric acid by xanthine oxidase (hereinafter also referred to as X.O.). On the other hand, the latter is increased renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid and the main mechanism is upregulation of human uric acid transporter (hereinafter also referred to as URAT1). Since uric acid is slightly soluble in water, that causes hyperuricemia. When uric acid in blood gets excessive, crystalline uric acid precipitates in the joints and so on and that causes an acute attack of arthritis (gout) or chronic changes in bones and joints.  Furthermore, complications such as urinary calculi and renal insufficiency ( gouty kidney) become a problem.<br><br>
[0003]<br>
Currently, as therapeutic agents for gout and hyperuricemia, alloprinol, a X.O. inhibitor, is widely used. In addition, other therapeutic agents for hyperuricemia having a X.O. inhibitory effect are disclosed in Patent references 1 to 4. Benzbromarone having an inhibitory effect of uric acid reabsorption (an uricosuric effect) is also used. As another agent, probenecid is illustrated, but it is not frequently used due to its weak activity.  In addition, biaryl compounds or diaryl ether compounds described in Patent reference 5 are reported as agents having an uricosuric effect.<br>
[Patent reference 1]   Japanese Patent No.3399559 specification.<br>
[Patent reference 2]   Japanese Patent No.3220987 specification.<br>
[Patent reference 3]   Japanese Patent Publication No.2002-105067 gazette.<br>
[Patent reference 4]   International Publication NO.W003/064410 pamphlet.<br>
[Patent reference 5]   Japanese Patent Publication No.2000-001431 gazette.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Problem that the invention aims to solve<br>
[0004]<br>
However, regarding allopurlnol of a X.O. inhibitor, oxypurinol, a methabolic product, can be accumulated in a body, and adverse effects such as rash, deterioration of renal function, hepatitis and the like have been reported, and thus, it is not always an easy-to-use agent.  In addition, regarding<br><br>
benzbromarone which has an inhibitory effect of uric acid reabsorption (an uricosuric effect), severe adverse effects such as fulminant hepatitis are reported and calculi can be caused. Therefore, proper limited use is required, and it is not always an easy-to-use agent. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the therapeutic agents for hyperuricemia having a X.O. inhibitory effect described in Patent references 1 to<br>
4	are still uncertain.  Pharmacological effects of the biaryl<br>
compounds or diary ether compounds described in Patent reference<br>
5	seem weaker than existing products. Most of therapeutic<br>
agents in the technical field have been sold for a few decades,<br>
and in order to broaden treatment options, a new therapeutic<br>
agent has been still desired in the medical field.<br>
[0005]<br>
Therefore , the objective of the present invention is to provide a novel compound having a X.O. inhibitory effect and an uricosuric effect, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient the same.<br>
