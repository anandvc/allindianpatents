				<td>2,5-disubstituted 3-mercaptopentanoic acid<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which inhibit basic carboxypeptidases, more specifically carboxypeptidase U, and thus can be used in the prevention and treatment of diseases wherein inhibition of carboxypeptidase U is beneficial, such as thrombosis and hypercoagulability in blood and tissue, atherosclerosis, adhesions, dermal scarring, cancer, fibrotic conditions, inflammatory diseases and those conditions which benefit from maintaining or enhancing bradykinin levels in the body. In further aspects, the invention relates to compounds of the invention for use in therapy; to processes for preparation of such new compounds; to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient; and to the use of the active compounds in the manufacture of medicaments for the medical use indicated above.<br>
Fibrinolysis is the result of a series of enzymatic reactions resulting in the degradation of fibrin by plasmin. The activation of plasminogen is the central process in fibrinolysis. The cleavage of plasminogen to produce plasmin is accomplished by the plasminogen activators, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Initial plasmin degradation of fibrin generates carboxy-terminal lysine residues that serve as high affinity binding sites for plasminogen. Since plasminogen bound to fibrin is much more readily activated to plasmin than free plasminogen this mechanism provides a positive feedback regulation of fibrinolysis.<br>
One of the endogenous inhibitors to fibrinolysis is carboxypeptidase U (CPU). CPU is also known as plasma carboxypeptidase B, active thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa), carboxypeptidase R and inducible carboxypeptidase activity. CPU is formed during coagulation and fibrinolysis from its precursor proCPU by the action of proteolytic enzymes, such as thrombin, thrombin-thrombomodulin complex or plasmin. CPU cleaves basic amino acids at the carboxy-terminal of fibrin fragments. The loss of carboxy-terminal lysines and thereby of lysine binding sites for plasminogen then serves to inhibit fibrinolysis. By inhibiting the loss of lysine binding sites for plasminogen and thus increase the rate of plasmin formation, effective inhibitors of carboxypeptidase U are expected to facilitate fibrinolysis.<br>
2-Mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid is reported as a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor. More recently, this compound has been shown to inhibit CPU, Hendriks, D. et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1034 (1990) 86-92.<br>
Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid is reported as a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor. More recently, this compound has been shown to inhibit CPU, Eaton, D. L., et al, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 266 (1991) 21833-21838.<br>
CPU inhibitors are disclosed in WO 00/66550, WO 00/66557, WO 03/013526 and WO 03/027128 and a pharmaceutical formulation containing a CPU inhibitor and a thrombin inhibitor is disclosed in WO 00/66152. Inhibitors of plasma carboxypeptidase B are disclosed in WO 01/19836. Inhibitors of TAFIa are disclosed hi WO 02/14285.<br>
It has now been found that compounds of formula (I) are particularly effective as inhibitors of carboxypeptidase U and are thereby useful as medicaments for the treatment or prophylaxis of conditions wherein inhibition of carboxypeptidase U is beneficial.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by adaptation of methods described in the literature (for example WO 00/66557), or by using or adapting the methods of Examples 1,26 or 51 below. It will be appreciated that when adapting methods of the literature or Examples 1,26 or 51 functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups. The preparations of certain intermediates are presented in Schemes 1 and 2.<br>
For example a compound of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II):<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
and, optionally reacting the functional group on R1 (for example R1 might include an acid group that can be coupled with an amino function to form an amide in the presence of a catalyst (such as HATU)), and subsequently removing the protecting groups as necessary. Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, carboxylate and amino groups.

The inhibiting effect of the compounds of the present invention was estimated using the assay described in: Dirk Hendriks, Simon Scharpe and Marc van Sande, Clinical Chemistry, 31,1936-1939 (1985); and Wei Wang, Dirk F. Hendriks, Simon S. Scharpe, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269,15937-15944 (1994).<br>

For the above-mentioned therapeutic uses the dosage administered will vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the disorder indicated.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or solvates of salts thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the formula (I) compound, salt, solvate or solvate of salt (active ingredient) is in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition will, for example, comprise from 0.05 to 99 %w (per cent by weight), such as from 0.05 to 80 %w, for example from 0.10 to 70 %w, such as from 0.10 to 50 %w, of active ingredient, all percentages by weight being based on total composition.<br>
The present invention thus also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a solvate of such a salt, as hereinbefore defined, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.<br>

• EXAMPLE 1<br>
This Example illustrates the preparation of 2-[(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)methyl]-5-(1,1 '-biphenyl-3-yl)-3-mercaptopentanoic acid (a) 3-(l J'-Biphenyl-S-vDpropanal<br>
To a solution of 3-iodo-l,l'-biphenyl (0.964 g, 3.44 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (0.956g, 3.44 mmol) in dry DMF (3 mL) was added allyl alcohol (0.351 mL, 5.16 mmol), sodium hydrogencarbonate (0.723 g, 8.60 mmol), and palladium(II) acetate (31 mg, 0.14 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with EtOAc and the solid material filtered off (Celite). The filtrate was washed with water three times, dried (NajSO^ and concentrated. Flash chromatography (heptan/tert-butyl methyl ether, 4:1) of the residue gave 3-(l,l'-biphenyl-3-yl)propanal (0.601 g, 83%).<br>
(b) tert-Buty] 5-d.r-biphenvl-3-vl)-2-({6-[(ferf-butoxycarbonvl')amino1pvridin-3-<br>

A solution of tert-butyl 3-{6-[(ter^butoxycarbonyl)ammo]pyridin-3-yl}-2-<br>
(diethoxyphosphoryl)propanoate (1.058 g, 2.31 mmol) in dry THF (4 mL) was added to a<br>
solution of sodium hydride (0.111 g, 60% in mineral oil, 2.77 mmol) in dry THF (3 mL) at 0 °C and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 60 min. To this mixture a solution of 3-(l,l'-biphenyl-3-yl)propanal (0.582 g, 2.77 mmol) in dry THF (3 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to attain room temperature over 22 h. EtOAc was then added, and the organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous NH4C1 and water, dried (NajSC^) and concentrated. Flash chromatography (toluene/EtOAc, 15:1) of the residue gave ferf-butyl 5-(l,r-biphenyl-3-yl)-2-({6-[(fer^butoxycarbonyl)amino]pyridin-3-yl}methyl)perit-2-enoate (1.105 g, 93%) as a mixture of E/Z-isomers.<br>

A solution of 4-methoxy-a-toluenethiol (0.58 mL, 4.17 mmol) hi dry, degassed DMF (2 mL) was treated at room temperature with a catalytic amount of sodium hydride<br>
