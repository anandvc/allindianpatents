This invention relates to a process for producing optically active isopulegol using tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy) aluminum as catalyst, which is a useful material for making aromas and an important precursor for synthesizing menthol.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Menthol, particularly i-menthol is extraordinary important as an aroma with coolness and has been finding wide applications in a variety of fields.  Known methods of synthesizing menthol are divided into optical resolution of d-?-menthol and asymmetric synthesis (see Indoh Moto-ichi, Gosel  Koryo, Kagaku Kogyo Nipposha, pp. 106-114) .  In the route of asymmetric synthesis, t-menthol is obtained by hydrogenation of I-isopulegol as a precursor.  Synthesis of the I-isopulegol involves selective cyclization of d-citronellal as an important step .<br>
The process of producing £-isopulegol comprising selectively cyclizing d-citronellal in the presence of zinc bromide as a catalyst, which is. disclosed in JP-A-53-116348 and Nakatani and Kawashima, Synthesis, p. 147 (1978), has already been put to practical use.  In this process, the ratio of I-isopulegol to other isomers is 94/6.<br><br>
Other catalysts hitherto reported for selective cyclization of citronellal include Me2AlCl (Micheal, K. and Snider, B.B., J.   Am. Soc.,   102, pp. 7951-7953<br>
(1980)), Zn(binaphthol) (Sakane, S. et al., Tetrahedron Lett.,   vol. 26, No. 45, pp. 5535-5538 (1985)), RhCl(PPh)3<br>
(Funakoshi, K. et al., Chem. Pharm.   Bull.,   vol. 37, No. 8, pp. 1990-1994 (1989)), an acid catalyst supported on a silica gel or alumina carrier (Kropp, P.J., J.   Org. Chem.,   vol. 60, pp. 4146-4152 (1995)), Zn/trimethylsilyl chloride (Marty, M. et al., Tetrahedron,   vol. 52, No. 13, pp. 4645-4658 (1996)), Sml2 (Sarkar, T.K. and Nandy, S.K., Tetrahedron  Lett.,   vol. 37, No. 29, pp. 5195-5198<br>
(1996)), Sc(trifluoromethane sulfonate)3 (Aggarwal, V.K. et al., Tetrahedron Lett.,   vol. 39, pp. 1997-2000 (1998) and International Publication WO 99/32422) , trans-[Ru(salen) (NO) (H20)]+ (Ellis, W.W. et al. , Chem. Common.,   pp. 1311-1312 (1998)), S-Zr02 (Yadav, G.D. and Nair, J.J., Chem. Commun., pp. 2369-2370 (1998)), and solid catalysts (JP-A-11-267524).  None of these catalysts is superior in selectivity to isopulegol to zinc bromide that have been used in industry.<br>
Sc(trifluoromethane sulfonate)3 is equal to zinc bromide in selectivity only when the reaction is conducted in an extremely low temperature of -78°C. The selectivity to i-isopulegol reduces to 80% at room temperature, which is insufficient for industrialization.<br><br>
The catalyst of the present invention, a tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy) aluminum, is reported as a catalyst for polymerization (JP-A-11-335432) or aldol condensation (Yamamoto, H. et al., J.   Am. Chem. Soc.,   vol. 116, pp. 4131-4132 (1994), Yamamoto, H. et al., J.   Am.    Chem. Soc.,,   vol. 122, pp. 7847-7848 (2000)).  Application of this catalyst to cyclization reactions, still less to synthesis of isopulegol, has not been reported nor known.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for obtaining isopulegol through high-selectivity cyclization of citronellal, particularly a process for producing I-isopulegol, which is an important synthesis precursor for I-menthol and is useful as a material of perfumes, etc., by simple operations with safety in high yield.<br>
As a result of extensive investigations, the present inventors have found that a specific catalyst enables citronellal to be cyclized to provide isopulegol in high yield and at such a selectivity as high as 98% or more based on the total isomers produced, i.e., isopulegol, isoisopulegol, neoisopulegol, and, neoispisopulegol.

EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of 
Into a 50 ml   Schlenk tube were put 240 mg (1 mmol) of 2,6-diphenylphenol and 5 m( of toluene to prepare a solution at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. To the solution was added 0.35 ml   of a 0.93 mol toluene solution of triethylaluminum (Et3Al, 0.33 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to prepare a catalyst solution. The catalyst solution was cooled to 0°C, and 5.07 g (32.9 mmol) of d-citronellal (available from Takasago International Corp.) cooled to -15°C was added thereto dropwise, followed by stirring at 0°C for 4 hours. After completion of the reaction, 2 mi   of a 8% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, and 5.05 g of dodecane was added as an internal standard.  The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, the yield of (-isopulegol was 95.3% and the ratio of *-isopulegol to other isomers was 99.3/0.7.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 13 Synthesis of l-isopulegol:<br>
Into a 100 ml   reaction vessel were put 4.79 g of 2,6-diphenylphenol and 40 ml of toluene at room temperature under an argon atmosphere to prepare a solution.  To the solution was added 1  ml   of a toluene solution of triethylaluminum (EtaAl, 0.93 mol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to prepare a catalyst solution.  Separately, 100 g of d-citronellal (available from Takasago International Corp.) and 55 ml   of toluene were put into a 300 ml   reaction vessel under an argon atmosphere, and the mixture was cooled to 0°C.  The whole amount of the catalyst solution prepared above and cooled to 0°C was added thereto dropwise, followed by stirring at 0°C for 4 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml   of a 4% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, followed by liquid-liquid separation.  Toluene was removed by evaporation, and the residue was distilled. A fraction having a boiling point of<br><br>
91°C/1200 Pa (9 mmHg) was collected as a colorless oily product weighing 87.7 g. As a result of analysis by gas chromatography, it was found that l-isopulegol had been produced with a purity of 94.7% in a yield of 83.1% at an l-isopulegol to other isomers ratio of 99.7/0.3.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 Synthesis of d-isopulegol:<br>
Into a 30 ml reaction vessel were put 1.21 g of 2,6-diphenylphenol and 15 ml of toluene under an argon atmosphere at room temperature to prepare a solution. To the solution was added 1.75 ml of a toluene solution of triethylaluminum (Et3Al, 0.93 mol) , and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to prepare a catalyst solution.  Separately, 5 g of l-citronellal (available from Takasago International Corp.) was put into a 50 ml reaction vessel and cooled to -15°C under an argon atmosphere.  The whole amount of the above prepared catalyst solution cooled to -15°C was added dropwise to the citronellal.  The mixture was stirred at -15°C for<br>
1	hour, then at -10°C for 1 hour, and finally at -5°C for<br>
2	hours. After completion of the reaction, 20 ml of a 2% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, followed by liquid-liquid separation. Toluene was removed by evaporation, and the residue was distilled to obtain a colorless oily product weighing 4.19 g. As a result of analysis by gas chromatography,<br><br>
it was found that d-isopulegol had been produced with a purity of 98.2% in a yield of 82.3% at a d-isopulegol to other isomers ratio of 99.4/0.6.<br>
EXAMPLE 15 Synthesis of d£-isopulegol:<br>
In Example 15, isopulegol was synthesized in the same manner as in Example 1, except for replacing d-citronellal with 5.00 g of dl-citronellal. As a result, dt-isopulegol was obtained in a yield of 95.1%, and the ratio of d*-isopulegol to other isomers was 99.4/0.6.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
(1)	Into a 50 m* Schlenk tube were put 1.03 g of 2,6-diphenylphenol and 13.5 ml of toluene under an argon atmosphere at room temperature to prepare a solution. To the solution was added 1.5 mt   of a toluene solution of triethylaluminum (EtsAl, 0.93 mol) , and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to prepare a pale yellow catalyst solution.  The solvent was removed from the catalyst solution by evaporation in a high vacuum to give 1.06 g of the catalyst as pale yellow powder.<br>
(2)	In a 50 ml   Schlenk tube was charged 1.01 g of d-citronellal and cooled to -15°C under an argon atmosphere.  The catalyst powder (249 mg) obtained in (1) above was added thereto, and the temperature was elevated up to 5°C while stirring over a period of 17 hours.<br><br>
After completion of the reaction, 2 ml of a 4% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, and 1.14 g of dodecane was added as an internal standard. The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result,  the yield of *-isopulegol was 95.0% and the ratio of £-isopulegol to other isomers was 99.6/0.4.<br>
The amount of the catalyst, the amount of the solvent used, the reaction temperature, reaction time, yield of isopulegol and the ratio of isopulegol to other isomers in Examples 1 to 16 are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br><br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>

After the reaction, 2 mi   of a 8% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added, and 1.23 g of dodecane was added thereto as an internal standard. The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, the yield of *-isopulegol was 74.5% and the ratio of f-isopulegol to other isomers was 86.4/13.6.  Other than *-isopulegol and the isomers, 0.7% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the resist being high-boiling substances.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
Into a 50 mi   Schlenk tube was put 73 mg of zinc bromide under an argon atmosphere, and 1.03 g of d-citronellal and 7 mt   of toluene were added thereto, followed by stirring at 25°C for 1 hour.  After completion of the reaction, 5 ml   of a 8% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added, and 1.12 g of dodecane was added thereto as an internal standard.  The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, the yield of £-isopulegol was 16.7% and the ratio of i-isopulegol to other isomers was 92.9/7.1.<br><br>
Other than l-isopulegol and the isomers, 78.2% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the rest being high-boiling substances.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3<br>
Into a 50 ml Schlenk tube were put 91.5 mg (1 mmol) of phenol and 7 ml of toluene under an argon atmosphere to form a solution. To the solution was added 0.35 ml of a 0.93 mol toluene solution containing 0.33 mmol of triethylaluminum (EtaAl) , followed by stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes to prepare a catalyst solution. Then, 1.02 g (6.62 mmol) of d-citronellal was added thereto dropwise, followed by stirring at 25°C for 17 hours. After completion of the reaction, 2 ml of a 8% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added, and 1.12 g of dodecane was added thereto as an internal standard. The organic layer was analyzed by gas chromatography.  As a result, the yield of l-isopulegol was 11.8% and the ratio of l-isopulegol to other isomers was 83.9/16.1.<br>
Other than l-isopulegol and the isomers, 7 6.3% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the rest consisting of high-boiling substances.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
As Comparative Example 4, isopulegol was synthesized in the same manner as in Comparative Example 3, except for replacing phenol with 166 mg of 2-phenylphenol. As a result of gas chromatography analysis, the yield of I-<br><br>
isopulegol was 19.3%, and the ratio of (-isopulegol to other isomers was 90.9/9.1.<br>
Other than (-isopulegol and the isomers,3.0% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the rest being high-boiling substances.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
As Comparative Example 5, isopulegol was synthesized in the same manner as in Comparative Example 3, except for replacing phenol with 119 mg of 2,6-dimethylphenol and changing the reaction time to 1 hour. As a result of gas chromatography analysis, the yield of (-isopulegol was 14.1% and the ratio of (-isopulegol to other isomers was 85.3/14.7.<br>
Other than (-isopulegol and the isomers, 11.6% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the rest being high-boiling substances.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
As Comparative Example 6, isopulegol was synthesized in the same manner as in Comparative Example 3, except for replacing phenol with 201 mg of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol.  As a result of gas chromatography analysis, the yield of (-isopulegol was 0%.<br>
Other than (-isopulegol and the isomers, 14.5% of unreacted d-citronellal was found, the rest being high-boiling substances.<br><br>
The kinds and amounts of the catalysts used, the reaction temperature, reaction time, and the reaction yield of isopulegol and the ratio of isopulegol to other isomers, in Comparative Examples 1 to 6 are shown in Table 5 below.<br><br>
As is apparent from Tables 4 and 5, cyclization using tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy)aluminum catalyst of the present invention (Examples 1-16) makes it possible to produce isopulegol in good yield by cyclization at a convenient temperature (-15 to 50°C) .  Neither an extremely low temperature or a high temperature is required.  Cyclization using zinc bromide (Comparative Examples 1 and 2) as a catalyst instead of tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy)aluminum catalyst of the present invention<br><br>
attained a yield of 74.5% and an isopulegol to other isomers ratio of 86.4/13.6 at a high temperature (110°C in Comparative Example 1), but the yield obtained at 25°C (Comparative Example 2) was as low as 16.7%.  It is understood that the zinc bromide requires high temperature. On the other hand, when phenol (no substituent on the 2,6-positions, Comparative Example 3), 2-phenylphenol (with an aryl group on only one of the 2,6-positions, Comparative Example 4) or 2,6-dimethylphenol or 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (with an alkyl group on the 2,6-positions, Comparative Examples 5 and 6) was used as a ligand of an organoaluminum compound catalyst, the highest yield of isopulegol attained was 19.3%.<br>
Thus, use of the tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy)aluminum catalyst according to the present invention in cyclization is of high utility in establishing synthesis of isopulegol.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing isopulegol, an important synthesis precursor for t-menthol and a useful material of aromas, etc., by using a tris(2,6-diarylphenoxy)aluminum catalyst in high yield at high selectivity.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various<br><br>
changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
This application is based on Japanese patent application No. 2001-10527 filed January 18, 2001, the entire contents thereof being hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br><br>
