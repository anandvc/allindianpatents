				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an improved dispersant additive composition that is<br>
used in engine oils; and it is also directed to the process of making the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to employ nitrogen containing dispersants and/or detergents in the formulation<br>
of lubricating oil compositions. Many of the known dispersant/detergent compounds are<br>
based on the reaction of an alkenylsuccinic acid or anhydride with an amine or polyamine<br>
to produce an alkenylsuccinimide or an alkenyl succinamic acid as determined by selected<br>
conditions of reaction. One problem facing the lubricant manufacturer is dispersancy of<br>
particulate matter in internal combustion engines. Failure to have adequate particulate<br>
matter dispersancy may result in filter plugging, sludge accumulation, and oil thickening.<br>

O-hydrocarbyl, OM+ where M+ represents one equivalent of a metal, ammonium or<br>
amine cation, --NH2, —CI, --Br, and taken together X and X' can be --0-- so as to form an<br>
anhydride. Preferably X and X' are such that both carboxylic functions can enter into<br>

include electron-deficient olefins such as monophenyl maleic anhydride; monomethyl,<br>
dimethyl, monochloro, monobromo, monofluoro, dichloro and difluoro maleic anhydride;<br>
N-phenylmaleimide and other substituted maleimides, isomaleimides; fumaric acid,<br>
maleic acid, alkyl hydrogen maleates and fumarates, dialkyl fumarates and maleates,<br>
fumaronilic acids and maleanic acids; and maleonitrile and fumaronitrile.<br>
Suitable monomers for (a) are monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or<br>

maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, methylenemalonic acid,<br>
citraconic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, citraconic anhydride and<br>

and methacrylic acid are preferred.<br>
18<br>

monobutyl maleate, dibutyl maleate, monodecyl maleate, didodecyl maleate,<br>
monooctadecyl maleate, and dioctadecyl maleate.<br>
(b) The 1 -Olefin or Polyolefin<br>
In the present invention at least one 1-olefin comprising about 2 to 40 carbon atoms or at<br>
least one polyolefin comprising about 4 to 360 carbon atoms and having a terminal<br>
copolymerizable group in the form of vinyl, vinylidene or alkyl vinylidene group is<br>
employed.<br>
Suitable 1-olefins for preparing copolymer (i) comprise from about 2 to about 40 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms, such as decene, dodecene,<br>
octadecene and mixtures of C20-C24 -1-olefins and C24-C28-I-olefins, more preferably from<br>
about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Preferably 1-olefins, which are also known as alpha<br>
olefins, with number average molecular weights in the range 100-4,500 or more are<br>
preferred, with molecular weights in the range of 200-2,000 being more preferred. For<br>
example, alpha olefins obtained from the thermal cracking of paraffin wax. Generally,<br>
these olefins range from about 5 to about 20 carbon atoms in length. Another source of<br>
alpha olefins is the ethylene growth process which gives even number carbon olefins.<br>
Another source of olefins is by the dimerization of alpha olefins over an appropriate<br>
catalyst such as the well known Ziegler catalyst. Internal olefins are easily obtained by the<br>
isomerization of alpha olefins over a suitable catalyst such as silica. Preferably, 1-olefins<br>
from C6-C30 are used because these materials are commercially readily available, and<br>
because they offer a desirable balance of the length of the molecular tail, and the solubility<br>
of the terpolymer in nonpolar solvents. Mixtures of olefins may also be employed.<br>
Suitable polyolefins for preparing copolymer (i) are polyolefins comprising about 4 to<br>
about 360 carbon atoms. These polymers have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of<br>
19<br>
from about 56 to about 5000 g/mol. Examples of these are oligomers of ethylene, of<br>
butene, including isobutene, and of branched isomers of pentene, hexene, octene and of<br>
decene, the copolymerizable terminal group of the oligomer being present in the form of a<br>
vinyl, vinylidene or alkylvinylidene group, oligopropenes and oligopropene mixtures of<br>
from about 9 to about 200 carbon atoms and in particular oligoisobutenes, as obtainable,<br>
for example, according to DE-A 27 02 604, corresponding U.S. Patent No. 4,152,499, are<br>
preferred. Mixtures of the stated oligomers are also suitable, for example, mixtures of<br>
ethylene and other alpha olefins. Other suitable polyolefins are described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,030,930 which is herein incorporated by reference. The molecular weights of the<br>
oligomers may be determined in a conventional manner by gel permeation<br>
chromatography.<br>
The copolymerizable polyolefin that is reacted with the unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic<br>
reactant are polymers comprising a major amount of C2 -C8 mono-olefin, e.g.,<br>
ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene and pentene. These polymers can be<br>
homopolymers such as polyisobutylene as well as copolymers of 2 or more such olefins<br>
such as copolymers of: ethylene and propylene, butylene, and isobutylene, etc.<br>
The polyolefin polymer usually contains from about 4 to about 360 carbon atoms,<br>
although preferably 8 to 200 carbon atoms; and more preferably from about 12 to about<br>
175 carbon atoms.<br>
Since the high molecular weight olefins used to prepare the copolymers of the present<br>
invention are generally mixtures of individual molecules of different molecular weights,<br>
individual copolymer molecules resulting will generally contain a mixture of high<br>
molecular weight polyalkyl groups of varying molecular weight. Also, mixtures of<br>
copolymer molecules having different degrees of polymerization will be produced.<br>
The copolymers of the present invention have an average degree of polymerization of 1 or<br>
greater, preferably from about 1.1 to about 20, and more preferably from about 1.5 to<br>
about 10.<br>

copolymerizable with the monomers of (a) and (b) and is selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
(1) an alkyl vinyl ether and an allyl alkyl ether where the alkyl group is hydroxyl,<br>
amino, dialkylamino or alkoxy substituted or is unsubstituted, and containing from<br>
about 1 to about 40 carbon atoms;<br>
Suitable monomers include the following: vinyl and allyl alkyl ethers where the alkyl<br>
radical is of about 1 to about 40 carbon atoms are also suitable, and the alkyl radical may<br>

vinyl ether, decylvinyl ether, dodecyl vinyl ether, octadecyl vinyl ether, 2-<br>
(diethylyamino)ethyl vinyl ether, 2-(di-n-butylamino)ethyl vinyl ether, and the<br>
corresponding allyl ethers.<br>

heterocyles, such as N-vinylimidazole, N-vinylmethylimidazole, Nvinylpyrrolidone<br>
and N-vinylcaprolactam.<br>

polyolefin comprising from about 4 to about 360 carbon atoms and having a<br>
terminal copolymerizable group in the form of a vinyl, vinylidene or alkyl<br>
vinylidene group or mixtures thereof, provided that the olefin employed is not the<br>
same as the olefin employed in (i)(b);<br>
Suitable 1-olefins comprise about 2 to 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 to<br>
about 30 carbon atoms, such as decene, dodecene, octadecene and mixtures of C20-<br>
C24 -1-olefins and C24-C28-I-olefins. Preferably 1-olefins, which are also known as<br>
alpha olefins, with number average molecular weights in the range of from about<br>
28 to about 560 are preferred, with molecular weights in the range of from about<br>
112 to about 420 being more preferred. For example, alpha olefins obtained from<br>
the thermal cracking of paraffin wax may be employed. Generally, these olefins<br>
range from about 5 to about 20 carbon atoms in length. Another source of alpha<br>
olefins is the ethylene growth process which gives even number carbon olefins.<br>
Another source of olefins is by the dimerization of alpha olefins over an<br>
appropriate catalyst such as the well known Ziegler catalyst. Internal olefins are<br>
easily obtained by the isomerization of alpha olefins over a suitable catalyst such<br>
as silica. Preferably, 1-olefins from C10-C30 are used because these materials are<br>
commercially readily available, and because they offer a desirable balance of the<br>
length of the molecular tail, and the solubility of the terpolymer in nonpolar<br>
solvents. Mixtures of olefins are also suitable.<br>

Preparation of Copolymer (i)<br>
Copolymer reactant (i) may be prepared from well known methods which are described in<br>
the art including, but not limited to, those methods which are disclosed in the following<br>
patents, which are herein incorporated by reference: Harrison et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>

6,512,055.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the copolymer reactant is a polyalkenyl<br>
succinic anhydride terpolymer. These terpolymers are composed of at least one of<br>
monomers (a) to (c) as described herein.<br>
Typically, the terpolymers of this invention contain at least one monomer from each group<br>
(a) to (c). In general, these components react to form terpolymers which can be random<br>
terpolymers or alternating terpolymers or block terpolymers and can be prepared by<br>
known procedures for making copolymers. Additionally, it is possible to form a small<br>
percentage of copolymers which are composed of monomers (a) and (b) and monomers (a)<br>
and (c). Component (a), the monocarboyxlic acid or ester thereof or dicarboxylic acid or<br>
anhydride or ester thereof, is selected from those disclosed above, preferably maleic<br>
anhydride. Component (b), the 1-olefin or polyolefin, is preferably polybutene.<br>
Component (c), the mono-olefin, is preferably a linear alpha olefin containing from about<br>
12 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
The degree of polymerization of the terpolymers can vary over a wide range. Preferably,<br>
the degree of polymerization is from about 2 to about 10. In general, terpolymer degree of<br>
polymerization decreases as the polymerization temperature increases.<br>
The terpolymerization is conducted in the presence of a suitable free radical initiator.<br>
Examples of suitable polymerization initiators are peroxide compounds, such as tertbutyl<br>
perpivalate, tertbutyl perneocecanoate, tert-butylperethylhexanoate,<br>
tertbutylperisobutyrate, di-tert-butyl peroxide, di-tert-amyl peroxide, diacetyl<br>
peroxydicaronate and dicyclohexyldicaronate, or azo compounds, such as 2,2'<br>
-azobisisobutyrontrile. The intiators may be used alone or as a mixture with one another.<br>
23<br>
Redox co-initiators may also be present. Preferably, the initiator is a peroxide type<br>
initiator, e.g., di(t-butyl) peroxide, dicumyl peroxide or azo type initiator,<br>
e.g., isobutylnitrile type initiators. Procedures for preparing poly 1-olefin copolymers are,<br>
for example, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,560,455 and 4,240,916, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety. Those procedures could be used to prepare terpolymers. Both<br>
patents also describe a variety of initiators.<br>
Copolymer (i), wherein a second olefin is employed in the reaction, can be prepared in the<br>
same manner as copolymer (ii) which is described below.<br>

24<br>
Thus, preferred copolymers of the present invention are prepared by reacting a "reactive"<br>
high molecular weight olefin in which a high proportion of unsaturation, at least about<br>
20% is in the alkylvinylidene configuration, e.g.,<br>
CH2<br>

wherein Rs and R9 are an alkyl or substituted alkyl of sufficient chain length to give the<br>
resulting molecule stability in lubricating oils and fuels, thus Rg generally has at least<br>
about 30 carbon atoms, preferably at least about 50 carbon atoms and R9 is a lower alkyl<br>
of from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, with an unsaturated acidic reactant in the<br>
presence of a free radical initiator.<br>

commercial materials well known to those skilled in the art. Disclosures thereof will be<br>
found, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,152,499 and 4,605,808, which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference for their disclosures of suitable polybutenes.<br>

Preferably, 1,1-disubstituted olefins are used to provide a high molecular weight, oil<br>
soluble tail in the terpolymer. Preferably the 1,1-disubstituted olefin has a number average<br>
Mn of from about 500 to about 5000. One particularly useful 1,1-disubstituted olefin is a<br>
1,1 -disubstituted polyisobutylene, such as methylvinylidene polyisobutylene.<br>
Preferably the copolymerizable polymer comprises a high molecular weight polyalkyl<br>
group which is derived from a high molecular weight olefin. The high molecular weight<br>
olefins used in the preparation of the copolymers of the present invention are of<br>
sufficiently long chain length so that the resulting composition is soluble in and<br>
compatible with mineral oils, fuels and the like; and the alkylvinylidene isomer of the high<br>
molecular weight olefin comprises at least about 20% of the total olefin composition.<br>
Preferably, the alkyl vinylidene isomer comprises at least 50%, more preferably at least<br>
70%, of the total olefin composition.<br>
Such high molecular weight olefins are generally mixtures of molecules having different<br>
molecular weights and can have at least one branch per 6 carbon atoms along the chain,<br>
preferably at least one branch per 4 carbon atoms along the chain, and particularly<br>
preferred that there be about one branch per 2 carbon atoms along the chain. These<br>
branched chain olefins may conveniently comprise polyalkenes prepared by the<br>
polymerization of olefins of from about 3 to about 6 carbon atoms, and preferably from<br>
olefins of from about 3 to about 4 carbon atoms, and more preferably from propylene or<br>
isobutylene. The addition-polymerizable olefins employed are normally 1-olefins. The<br>
branch may be of from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, more usually of from about 1 to<br>
about 2 carbon atoms and preferably methyl.<br>
The preferred alkylvinylidene isomer comprises a methyl- or ethylvinylidene isomer, more<br>
preferably the methylvinylidene isomer.<br>
The especially preferred high molecular weight olefins used to prepare the copolymers of<br>
the present invention are polyisobutenes which comprise at least about 20% of the more<br>
reactive methylvinylidene isomer, preferably at least about 50% and more preferably at<br>
least about 70%. Suitable polyisobutenes include those prepared using BF3 catalysis. The<br>
27<br>
preparation of such polyisobutenes in which the methylvinylidene isomer comprises a high<br>
percentage of the total composition is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,152,499 and<br>
4,605,808.<br>
Preparation of Copolymer (ii)<br>
As noted above, copolymer (ii) of the present invention is prepared by reacting an olefin<br>
and an unsaturated acidic reactant in the presence of a free radical initiator. The process of<br>
the preparation of copolymer (ii) is described in Harrison, U.S. Patent No. 5,112,507,<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of about -30°C to about 210°C, preferably<br>
from about 40°C to about 160°C. The degree of polymerization is inversely proportional<br>
to temperature. Accordingly, for the preferred high molecular weight copolymers, it is<br>
advantageous to employ lower reaction temperatures.<br>
The reaction may be conducted neat, that is, both the high molecular weight olefin, acidic<br>
reactant and the free radical initiator are combined in the proper ratio, and then stirred at<br>
the reaction temperature.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction may be conducted in a solvent. Suitable solvents include those<br>
in which the reactants and free radical initiator are soluble and include acetone,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, toluene, dioxane,<br>
chlorobenzene, xylenes, or the like. After the reaction is complete, volatile components<br>
may be stripped off. When a solvent is employed, it is preferably inert to the reactants and<br>
products formed and is generally used in an amount sufficient to ensure efficient mixing.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction may be conducted in a diluent, such as mineral oil, as long as<br>
the diluent does not contain constituents that interfere with the free radical polymerization,<br>
e.g., sulfur compounds, antioxidants and the like.<br>
28<br>
In general, the copolymerization can be initiated by any free radical initiator. Such<br>
initiators are well known in the art. However, the choice of free radical initiator may be<br>
influenced by the reaction temperature employed.<br>
The preferred free-radical initiators are the peroxide-type polymerization initiators and the<br>
azo-type polymerization initiators. Radiation can also be used to initiate the reaction, if<br>
desired.<br>
The peroxide-type free-radical initiator can be organic or inorganic, the organic having the<br>
general formula: R12 OORn where R12 is any organic radical and Rn is selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydrogen and any organic radical. Both R\2 and Rn can be organic<br>
radicals, preferably hydrocarbon, aryl, and acyl radicals, carrying, if desired, substituents<br>
such as halogens, etc. Preferred peroxides include di-tert-butyl peroxide, dicumyl<br>
peroxide, and di-tert-amyl peroxide.<br>
Examples of other suitable peroxides, which in no way are limiting, include benzoyl<br>
peroxide; lauroyl peroxide; other tertiary butyl peroxides; 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide;<br>
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide; cumene hydroperoxide; diacetyl peroxide; acetyl<br>
hydroperoxide; diethylperoxycarbonate; tertiary butyl perbenzoate; and the like.<br>
The azo-type compounds, typified by alpha,alpha' -azobisisobutyronitrile, are also wellknown<br>
free-radical promoting materials. These azo compounds can be defined as those<br>
having present in the molecule group ~N=N~ wherein the balances are satisfied by<br>
organic radicals, at least one of which is preferably attached to a tertiary carbon. Other<br>
suitable azo compounds include, but are not limited to, p-bromobenzenediazonium<br>
fluoroborate; p-tolyldiazoaminobenzene; p-bromobenzenediazonium hydroxide;<br>
azomethane and phenyldiazonium halides. A suitable list of azo-type compounds can be<br>
found in U.S. Patent No. 2,551,813, issued May 8, 1951 to Paul Pinkney.<br>
The amount of initiator to employ, exclusive of radiation, of course, depends to a large<br>
extent on the particular initiator chosen, the high molecular olefin used and the reaction<br>
29<br>
conditions. The usual concentrations of initiator are between 0.001:1 and 0.2:1 moles of<br>
initiator per mole of acidic reactant, with preferred amounts between 0.005:1 and 0.10:1.<br>
The polymerization temperature must be sufficiently high to break down the initiator to<br>
produce the desired free-radicals. For example, using benzoyl peroxide as the initiator, the<br>
reaction temperature can be between about 75°C and about 90°C, preferably between<br>
about 80°C and about 85°C higher and lower temperatures can be employed, a suitable<br>
broad range of temperatures being between about 20°C and about 200°C, with preferred<br>
temperatures between about 50°C and about 150°C.<br>
The reaction pressure should be sufficient to maintain the solvent in the liquid phase.<br>
Pressures can therefore vary between about atmospheric and 100 psig or higher.<br>
The reaction time is usually sufficient to result in the substantially complete conversion of<br>
the acidic reactant and high molecular weight olefin to copolymer. The reaction time is<br>
suitable between one and 24 hours, with preferred reaction times between 2 and 10 hours.<br>
As noted above, the subject reaction is a solution-type polymerization reaction. The high<br>
molecular weight olefin, acidic reactant, solvent and initiator can be brought together in<br>
any suitable manner. The important factors are intimate contact of the high molecular<br>
weight olefin and acidic reactant in the presence of a free-radical producing material. The<br>
reaction, for example, can be conducted in a batch system where the high molecular<br>
weight olefin is added all initially to a mixture of acidic reactant, initiator and solvent or<br>
the high molecular weight olefin can be added intermittently or continuously to the<br>
reactor. Alternatively, the reactants may be combined in other orders; for example, acidic<br>
reactant and initiator may be added to high molecular weight olefin in the reactor. In<br>
another manner, the components in the reaction mixture can be added continuously to a<br>
stirred reactor with continuous removal of a portion of the product to a recovery train or to<br>
other reactors in series. In yet another manner, the reaction may be carried out in a batch<br>
process, wherein the high molecular weight olefin is added initially to the reactor, and then<br>
the acidic reactant and the initiator are added gradually over time. The reaction can also<br>
30<br>
suitably take place in a tubular-type reactor where the components are added at one or<br>
more points along the tube.<br>
Copolymer (iii)<br>
In one embodiment, copolymer reactant (iii) is obtained by a copolymer obtained by (a)<br>
reacting compound (i)(a) with compound (i)(b) or (i)(c) in a non-free radical catalyzed<br>
reaction in the presence of copolymer (i) or copolymer (ii) or both; or by (b) contacting<br>
copolymer (i) or copolymer (ii) or both with the non-free radical catalyzed reaction<br>
product of compound (i)(a) and compound (i)(b) or (i)(c).<br>
Preparation of Copolymer (iii)<br>
A process for the preparation of copolymer (iii) is described, for example, in Harrison et<br>
al., U.S. Patent No. 6,451,920, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In process step (a) above, any unreacted olefin, generally the more hindered olefins, i.e.,<br>
the beta-vinylidene, that do not react readily with the monoethylenically unsaturated C3-<br>
C28 monocarboxylic acid or ester thereof, or C4-C28 dicarboxylic acid or an anhydride or<br>
ester thereof, under free radical conditions, are reacted with monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
C3-C28 monocarboxylic acid or ester thereof, or C4-C28 dicarboxylic acid or an anhydride<br>
or ester thereof, under thermal conditions, i.e., at temperatures of from about 180°C to<br>
about 280°C. These conditions are similar to those used for preparing thermal process<br>
PIBSA. Optionally, this reaction takes place in the presence of a strong acid, such as<br>
sulfonic acid. See for example U.S. Patent No. 6,156,850.<br>
Optionally, a solvent may be used to dissolve the reactants. The reaction solvent must be<br>
one which dissolves both the acidic reactant and the high molecular weight olefin. It is<br>
necessary to dissolve the acidic reactant and high molecular weight olefin so as to bring<br>
them into intimate contact in the solution polymerization reaction. It has been found that<br>
the solvent must also be one in which the resultant copolymers are soluble.<br>
Suitable solvents include liquid saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons having from about 6 to<br>
about 20 carbon atoms; ketones having from about 3 to about 5 carbon atoms; and liquid<br>
31<br>
saturated aliphatic dihalogenated hydrocarbons having from about 1 to about 5 carbon<br>
atoms per molecule, preferably from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms per molecule. By<br>
"liquid" is meant liquid under the conditions of polymerization. In the dihalogenated<br>
hydrocarbons, the halogens are preferably on adjacent carbon atoms. By "halogen" is<br>
meant F, CI and Br. The amount of solvent must be such that it can dissolve the acidic<br>
reactant and high molecular weight olefin in addition to the resulting copolymers. The<br>
volume ratio of solvent to high molecular weight olefin is suitably between 1:1 and 100:1<br>
and is preferably between 1.5:1 and 4:1.<br>
Suitable solvents include the ketones having from about 3 to about 6 carbon atoms and the<br>
saturated dichlorinated hydrocarbons having from about 1 to about 5, more preferably<br>
from about 1 to about 3, carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to:<br>
1. ketones, such as: acetone; methylethylketone; diethylketone; and<br>
methylisobutylketone;<br>
2. aromatic hydrocarbons, such as: benzene; xylene; and toluene;<br>
3. saturated dihalogenated hydrocarbons, such as: dichloromethane; dibromomethane;<br>
l-bromo-2-chloroethane; 1,1-dibromoethane; 1,1-dichloroethane; 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane; 1,3-dibromopropane; 1,2-dibromopropane; l,2-dibromo-2-<br>
methylpropane; 1,2-dichloropropane; 1,1-dichloropropane; 1,3-dichloropropane;<br>
1 -bromo-2-chloropropane; 1,2-dichlorobutane; 1,5-dibromopentane; and 1,5-<br>
dichloropentane; or<br>
4. mixtures of the above, such as: benzenemethylethylketone.<br>
The copolymer is conveniently separated from solvent and any unreacted acidic reactant<br>
by conventional procedures such as phase separation, solvent distillation, precipitation and<br>
the like. If desired, dispersing agents and/or co-solvents may be used during the reaction.<br>
32<br>
The polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride (PIBSA), which may be directly added to<br>
copolymer reactant (i) or (ii), is generally prepared by a number of well-known processes<br>
including the method disclosed within. For example, there is a well-known thermal<br>
process (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,361,673), an equally well-known chlorination process<br>
(see, e.g., U.S. Patent. No. 3,172,892), a combination of the thermal and chlorination<br>
processes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,912,764), catalytic strong acid processes (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,819,660 and 6,156,850), and free radical processes (see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,286,799 and 5,319,030). Such compositions include one-to-one monomeric<br>
adducts (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,219,666 and 3,381,022), as well as high succinic<br>
ratio products, adducts having alkenyl-derived substituents adducted with at least<br>
1.3 succinic groups per alkenyl-derived substituent (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,234,435).<br>
Polyalkylene succinic anhydrides also can be produced thermally also from high<br>
methylvinylidene polybutene as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,152,499. This process is<br>
further discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,241,003 for the case where the succinic ratio is less<br>
than 1.3 and in EP 0 355 895 for the case where the succinic ratio is greater than 1.3.<br>
European Applications EP 0 602 863 and EP 0 587 381, and U.S. Patent No. 5,523,417<br>
disclose a procedure for washing out the polymaleic anhydride resin from polyalkylene<br>
succinic anhydride prepared from high methylvinylidene polybutene. A polyalkylene<br>
succinic anhydride with a succinic ratio of 1.0 is disclosed. One advantage of polyalkylene<br>
succinic anhydride from high methylvinylidene polybutene is that it can be prepared<br>
essentially free of chlorine. U.S. Patent No. 4,234,435 teaches a preferred polyalkenederived<br>
substituent group with a number average (Mn) in the range of from about 1500 to<br>
about 3200. For polybutenes, an especially preferred number average (Mn) range is from<br>
about 1700 to about 2400. This patent also teaches that the succinimides must have a<br>
succinic ratio of at least 1.3. That is, there should be at least 1.3 succinic groups per<br>
equivalent weight of polyalkene-derived substituent group. Most preferably, the succinic<br>
ratio should be from 1.5 to 2.5.<br>
33<br>
Other suitable alkenyl succinic anhydrides includes those described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,030,930. Typical alkenyl used in the preparation are ethylene and 1-butene<br>
copolymers.<br>

38<br>
Generally, the polyether compounds suitable for use in the present invention will contain<br>
at least one ether unit preferably from about 5 to about 100, more preferably from about 10<br>
to about 50, and even more preferred from about 15 to about 25 ether units.<br>
Generally, the polyether compounds suitable for use in the present invention may be<br>

Amino Aliphatic Compound<br>
In addition to the ether compound (i.e. polyether polyamine, polyether polyamine<br>
derivative, polyether polyol, ether diamines and ether triamine) above, the copolymer is<br>
also reacted with an aliphatic compound. The aliphatic compound employed may be an<br>
amino aliphatic compound.<br>
The amino aliphatic compound may be selected from (a) aliphatic diamines, (b) aliphatic<br>
polyamines or (c) polyalkylene diamines and polyamines. The amino aliphatic compound<br>

and preferably primary amino groups. Suitable examples include ethylenediamine,<br>
diethylene triamine, triethylene tetraamine, hexamethylene diamine, aminoethyl<br>
piperazine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene hexamine and heavy polyamine, HPA,<br>
(available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan). Such amines encompass<br>
isomers such as branched-chain polyamines, cyclic polyamines and hydrocarbylsubstituted<br>
polyamines.<br>
Since more than one primary or secondary amino group is present, the reaction conditions<br>
and/or stoichiometry should be such that oil solubility is maintained.<br>
Hydroxy! Aliphatic Compound<br>
In addition to the ether compound (i.e. polyether aromatic compound) above, optionally,<br>
the copolymer may also be reacted with at least one aliphatic compound which may be a<br>

40<br>
Method of Making the Lubricating Oil Additive Composition<br>
The lubricating oil additive composition is prepared by a process comprising charging the<br>
reactant copolymer (e.g., at least one of copolymers (i), (ii) and (iii) as described herein) in<br>
a reactor, optionally under a nitrogen purge, and heating at a temperature of from about<br>
80°C to about 170°C. Optionally, diluent oil may be charged optionally under a nitrogen<br>
purge in the same reactor, thereby producing a diluted copolymer reactant. The amount of<br>
diluent oil in the diluted copolymer is up to about 80 wt. %, more preferred from about 20<br>
to about 60 wt. %, and most preferred from about 30 to about 50 wt. %. Both an aliphatic<br>
compound and an ether compound are charged, optionally under a nitrogen purge, to the<br>
reactor. This mixture is heated under a nitrogen purge to a temperature in range from<br>
about 130°C to about 200°C. Optionally, a vacuum is applied to the mixture for about 0.5<br>
to about 2.0 hours to remove excess water.<br>
The lubricating oil additive composition can also be made using a process comprising<br>
simultaneously charging all the reactants (reactant copolymer (i), (ii), or (iii); the aliphatic<br>
compound; and the ether compound at the desired ratios into the reactor. One or more of<br>
the reactants can be charged at an elevated temperature to facilitate mixing and reaction. A<br>
static mixer can be used to facilitate mixing of the reactants as they are being charged to<br>
the reactor. The reaction is carried out for about 0.5 to about 2 hours at a temperature from<br>
about 130°C to about 200°C. Optionally a vacuum is applied to the reaction mixture<br>
during the reaction period.<br>
Since more than one functional group is present on the aliphatic compound, the reaction<br>
conditions and/or stoichiometry should be such that oil solubility is maintained. For<br>
example, since multifunctional aliphatic compounds are used, the linker group (i.e., the<br>
polyether compound) and the copolymer are preferably charged to the reactor first and<br>
allowed to react prior to addition of the multifunctional aliphatic compound. Furthermore,<br>
the stoichiometry should be such that when the multifunctional aliphatic compound is<br>
charged to the reactor, there is generally about one mole of reactive sites remaining per<br>
mole of the multifunctional aliphatic compound. This reaction order and stoichiometry<br>
reduces excessive crosslinking by limiting the number of un-reacted reactive sites in the<br>
co-polymer relative to the number of reactive sites on the multifunctional aliphatic<br>
41<br>
compound. Reduction of excessive crosslinking may decrease the probability of gel<br>
formation and therefore increase the probability of oil solubility.<br>
Post-Treatment of the Lubricating Oil Additive Composition<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the lubricating oil additive composition is<br>
post-treated with a post-treating agent selected from a cyclic carbonate, a linear monocarbonate,<br>

fructose, galactose and the like and from vicinal diols prepared from Ci -C30 olefins by<br>
methods known in the art.<br>
Several of these cyclic carbonates are commercially available such as l,3-dioxolan-2-one<br>
or 4-methyl-l,3-dioxolan-2-one. Cyclic carbonates may be readily prepared by known<br>
reactions. For example, reaction of phosgene with a suitable alpha alkane diol or an alkan-<br>
1,3-diol yields a carbonate for use within the scope of this invention as for instance in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,115,206 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Likewise, the cyclic carbonates useful for this invention may be prepared by<br>
transesterification of a suitable alpha alkane diol or an alkan-1,3-diol with, e.g., diethyl<br>
carbonate under transesterification conditions. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,384,115<br>
42<br>
and 4,423,205 which are incorporated herein by reference for their teaching of the<br>
preparation of cyclic carbonates.<br>
Typical linear mono-carbonates include diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, dipropyl<br>
carbonate and the like. Typical linear poly-carbonates include poly(propylene carbonate)<br>
and the like.<br>

acids include the acids of the aforementioned anhydrides.<br>
Typical aromatic polycarboxylic acid esters include dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate,<br>

In another embodiment, the post-treating agent is an aromatic polycarboxylic<br>
acid, anhydride or ester.<br>
Preferably, the lubricating oil additive composition is post-treated with a post-treating<br>

Lubricating Oil Composition<br>
The lubricating oil additive composition described above is generally added to a base oil<br>
that is sufficient to lubricate moving parts, for example internal combustion engines, gears,<br>
and transmissions. Typically, the lubricating oil composition of the present invention<br>
comprises a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity and a minor amount of the<br>
lubricating oil additive composition.<br>
The base oil employed may be any of a wide variety of oils of lubricating viscosity. The<br>
base oil of lubricating viscosity used in such compositions may be mineral oils or<br>
synthetic oils. A base oil having a viscosity of at least 2.5 cSt at 40°C and a pour point<br>
below 20°C, preferably at or below 0°C, is desirable. The base oils may be derived from<br>
synthetic or natural sources.<br>
Mineral oils for use as the base oil in this invention include, for example, paraffinic,<br>
naphthenic and other oils that are ordinarily used in lubricating oil compositions. Synthetic<br>
oils include, for example, both hydrocarbon synthetic oils and synthetic esters and<br>
mixtures thereof having the desired viscosity. Hydrocarbon synthetic oils may include, for<br>
example, oils prepared from the polymerization of ethylene, polyalphaolefin or PAO oils,<br>
47<br>
or oils prepared from hydrocarbon synthesis procedures using carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen gases such as in a Fisher-Tropsch process. Useful synthetic hydrocarbon oils<br>
include liquid polymers of alpha olefins having the proper viscosity. Especially useful are<br>
the hydrogenated liquid oligomers of C6 to C12 alpha olefins such as 1-decene trimer.<br>
Likewise, alkyl benzenes of proper viscosity, such as didodecyl benzene, can be used.<br>
Useful synthetic esters include the esters of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic<br>
acids, as well as mono-hydroxy alkanols and polyols. Typical examples are didodecyl<br>
adipate, pentaerythritol tetracaproate, di-2-ethylhexyl adipate, dilaurylsebacate, and the<br>
like. Complex esters prepared from mixtures of mono and dicarboxylic acids and mono<br>
and dihydroxy alkanols can also be used. Blends of mineral oils with synthetic oils are<br>
also useful.<br>
Thus, the base oil can be a refined paraffin type base oil, a refined naphthenic base oil, or a<br>
synthetic hydrocarbon or non-hydrocarbon oil of lubricating viscosity. The base oil can<br>
also be a mixture of mineral and synthetic oils.<br>
Method of Use of the Present Invention<br>
The lubricating oil additive composition of the present invention is added to an oil of<br>
lubricating viscosity thereby producing a lubricating oil composition. The lubricating oil<br>
composition contacts the engine, improving dispersancy. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention is also directed to a method of improving soot dispersancy, sludge dispersancy<br>
or both in an internal combustion engine which comprises operating the engine with the<br>
lubricating oil composition of the invention.<br>
Optionally, the lubricating oil additive composition described above may be used as a fuel<br>
additive. When used in fuels, the proper concentration of the additive that is necessary to<br>
achieve the desired detergency is dependent upon a variety of factors including the type of<br>
fuel used, the presence of other detergents or dispersants or other additives, etc. Generally,<br>
however, the range of concentration of the additive in the base fuel is 10 to 10,000 weight<br>
parts per million, preferably from 30 to 5,000 parts per million of the additive. If other<br>
detergents are present, a lesser amount of the additive may be used. The additives<br>
described herein may be formulated as a fuel concentrate, using an inert stable oleophilic<br>
48<br>
solvent boiling in the range of about 150-400°F (65.6-204.4°C). Preferred solvents boil in<br>
the gasoline or diesel fuel range. Preferably, an aliphatic or an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
solvent is used, such as a benzene, toluene, xylene or higher-boiling aromatics or aromatic<br>
thinners. Aliphatic alcohols of about 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as isopropanol,<br>
isobutylcarbinol, n-butanol and the like in combination with hydrocarbon solvents are also<br>
suitable for use with the fuel additive. In the fuel concentrate, the amount of the additive<br>
will be ordinarily at least 5 % by weight and generally not exceed 70 % by weight,<br>
preferably from 5 to 50 and more preferably from 10 to 25 wt. %.<br>

Soot Thickening Bench Test Results<br>
The polysuccinimides and post-treated polysuccinimides from Examples 1-12 were<br>
reacted in the soot thickening bench test, which measures the ability of a formulation to<br>
disperse and control viscosity increase resulting from the addition of carbon black, a soot<br>
surrogate. In this test, 98.0 g of the test sample was weighed and placed into a 250 mL<br>
beaker. The test sample contained 7.6 wt. % of the test dispersant, 50 millimoles of an<br>
overbased phenate detergent, 18 millimoles of a zinc dithiophosphate wear inhibitor and<br>
7.3 wt. % of a VI improver, in 85% 150N oil, 15% 600N oil. To this was added 2.0 g<br>
Vulcan XC-72® carbon black from Cabot Co. The mixture was stirred and then stored for<br>
16 hours in a dessicator. A second sample without the carbon black was mixed for 60<br>
seconds using a Willems Polytron Homogenizer-Model PF 45/6 and then degassed in a<br>
vacuum oven for 30 minutes at 50 to 55°C. The viscosity of the two samples was then<br>
measured at 100°C using a capillary viscometer. The percent viscosity increase was<br>
calculated by comparing the viscosity of the samples with and without carbon black. Thus,<br>
the lower the percent viscosity increase the better the dispersancy of the dispersant. The<br>
results from the soot thickening bench test are shown in Table 1.<br>
