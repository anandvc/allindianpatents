an Indian Company <br>
Aditya Birla Center, S. K. Ahire Marg, Worli, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a unit of matter which is capable of being<br>
spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of<br>
methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and<br>
which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
The fibers from natural sources are basically classified into two types: natural<br>
fibers and man made or manufactured fibers.<br>
The term "natural fiber" means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g.<br>
vegetable fibers or wood fibers. Man-made fibers are obtained by treating natural<br>
raw materials with synthetic chemicals. Many types of fiber are manufactured from<br>
natural cellulose, including rayon.<br>
For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw<br>
materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, however, the industrialization<br>
and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far<br>
superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Rayon is natural cellulosic material obtained from wood pulp or cotton. Some of<br>
the reasons for popularity and success of Rayon in clothing industry include its low<br>
cost, diversity and ability to provide comfort. Rayon is moisture absorbent (more<br>
so than cotton), breathable, comfortable to wear, and easily dyed in vivid colors.<br>
Rayon is soft to the skin and has moderate dry strength and abrasion resistance.<br>
Like other cellulosic fibers, it is not resilient, which means that it will wrinkle. One<br>
of rayon's strengths is its versatility and ability to blend easily with many fibers.<br>
A wide  variety  of rayon  materials  are  available.  Viscose rayon  fibers  are manufactured by preparing strongly alkaline viscose solution of cellulosic pulp by<br>
2<br><br>
xanthation and spinning the cellulose xanthate solution in a sulfuric acid spin bath to regenerate the viscose. Viscose rayon fibers are commonly used in apparel (such as accessories, dresses, jackets, linings, millinery, slacks, sport shirts, sportswear, suits, ties, work clothes), home furnishings (such as bedspreads, blankets, curtains, draperies, sheets, slipcovers, tablecloths, upholstery) and other industrial areas (such as industrial products, medical and surgical products, non woven products, tire cord and the like).<br>
Differences in raw material, processing chemicals, fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for particular application. It is often desired that the rayon fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain, perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable interest in developing such materials.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,689,466 relates to a stable phase change materials for use in temperature regulating synthetic fibers, fabrics and textiles. A stabilized phase change composition comprises a phase change material and a stabilizing agent selected from the group consisting of antioxidants and thermal stabilizers. The stabilizing agent provides oxidative or thermal stabilization to the phase change material. The stabilized phase change composition was used or incorporated in a variety of processes e.g., melt spinning processes, extrusion processes, injection molding processes to form articles having enhanced reversible thermal properties. Exemplary articles that may be formed include synthetic fibers like nylon fibers, polyester fibers, polyethylene fibers, polypropylene fibers, and<br>
3<br><br>
multi-component fibers, fabric materials, textiles, films, foams, sheets, pellets, granules, rods, and injection molded articles.<br>
United States Patent Application no. 20070026228 discloses cellulosic fibers having enhanced reversible thermal properties and applications of such cellulosic fibers. The cellulosic fibers include a fiber body including a cellulosic material and a set of microcapsules dispersed in the cellulosic material. The set of microcapsules contain a phase change material having a latent heat of at least 40 J/g and a transition temperature in the range of 0°C-100°C. The phase change material provides thermal regulation based on absorption and release of the latent heat at the transition temperature. The cellulosic fibers were formed via a solution spinning process, and used in various products where thermal regulating properties are desired.<br>
The present invention provides temperature regulating rayon fibers.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
1.	It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide temperature regulating rayon fibers.<br>
2.	It is another object of the invention to provide temperature regulating rayon fibers having enhanced durability in use, especially a resistance to washing and good mechanical properties.<br>
3.	It is a further object of the invention to provide regenerated rayon fibers which are resistant to heat, moisture, solvents and dry cleaning.<br>
4<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to present invention, there is provided regenerated cellulose fibers containing additives, wherein the additives are embedded in pockets along the length of fibers. The additives remain embedded even after multiple washings or rough use of the fibers.<br>
The additives in accordance with this invention are organic compounds with melting transition in the range of about 0°C-60 °C or inorganic or hydrated salts with dehydration temperatures in the range of about 0°C-60 °C, which impart a temperature regulating features to the fibers and ultimately fabric or garments made from these fibers. The additives are hydrophobic in nature.<br>
The temperature regulating rayon fibers according to the present invention are prepared by homogenizing the viscose with micro-emulsion solution containing suitable active ingredient. Such treated viscose is then extruded or spun into fiber, film or any other desired form. The treatment of viscose with the micro-emulsion solution before spinning or extrusion results in effective adhesion of additive on to the rayon material.<br>
Typically, a mixture of appropriate active ingredient is prepared in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents.<br>
A few non-limiting examples of suitable solvents include C10-C44 alkanes, paraffinic hydrocarbons, polyethylene, polypropylene, polypropylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, polypropylene malonate, polyneopentyl glycol sebacate, polypentane glutarate, polyvinyl myristate, polyvinyl stearate, polyvinyl laurate, polyhexadecyl methacrylate, polyoctadecyl methacrylate, polyethylene oxides, polyethylene glycols, polyester and mixtures thereof.<br>
5<br><br>
It is desirable that the active ingredient is soluble in solvent in the range of about 5 to 100%. Further, the active ingredient and other additives should be insoluble in water.<br>
Typically, a mixture of active ingredient in appropriate solvent is prepared and mixed with a suitable surfactant to get a micro-emulsion. Such mixing may be achieved using high speed mixers such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional additives, if desired.<br>
Typically, the viscose rayon obtained using above process results in the formation of fibers containing pockets of dispersed phase trapped in the viscose matrix. These pockets serve as a reservoir for added active ingredients. The active ingredient is released from the reservoir into the viscose matrix. The structure of reservoir, viscose and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the active ingredient. For example, release of active ingredient can be triggered by volatilizing of the active ingredient from reservoir upon contact with body temperature. The molecules migrate from the reservoir to the surrounding primarily by diffusion.<br>
Various other textile fibers containing temperature regulating active ingredient can be prepared using the methods disclosed herein. Typical, non-limiting examples of such textiles fibers include acrylic fibers, polyester fibers and the like.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific steps of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the podaedroue embodiment without<br>
6<br><br>
departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well ar other embodiments of the inventi_n will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, wheodby Yt is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matteo!is to be interpreted merely ar illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br><br>
