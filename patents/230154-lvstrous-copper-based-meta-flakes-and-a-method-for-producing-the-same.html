				<td>Copper-Based Metal Flakes, in Particular Comprising Aluminum, and Me-<br>
thod for Production Thereof<br>
Metallic effect pigments are pigments that exhibit specular reflection on flat, ori-<br>
ented particles (DIN 55944). The interest in lustrous gold-colored effect pigments<br>
is great, particularly in the fields of application of printing, lacquer, paint coating,<br>
plastic coloring, cosmetics and glass coloring, since the gold-like products have a<br>
high aesthetic quality and impart to such coated, imprinted or colored materials<br>
an expensive look. Early on it was begun to replace the expensive genuine gold<br>
flakes in the decorative field with more cost-effective alternatives.<br>
The best known genuine-gold flake substitute pigments are the so-called gold<br>
bronze powders, which consist predominantly of copper/zinc alloys and, depend-<br>
ing on their composition, may have different shades of color ranging from red<br>
gold to rich gold (Pigment Handbook, Vol. 1, Second Edition, p. 805 ff, Wiley).<br>
Gold bronze pigments are produced through atomization of a molten copper/zinc<br>
alloy and subsequent grinding of the granules produced by the atomization. Dur-<br>
ing the grinding process, the alloy particles are deformed flake-like and commin-<br>
uted. In practice gold bronze pigment is predominantly ground dry. To prevent<br>
cold welding, a lubricant, such as stearic acid, is added to the utilized granules. A<br>
post-treatment of the ground product by brushing or gentle milling in special ball<br>
mills serves to improve the luster of the metal pigment and is referred to as pol-<br>
ishing. Irregularities in the surfaces of the metal flakes have a luster-reducing<br><br>
effect. Since the generation of irregularities in the structure of the surfaces of the<br>
flakes and different flake thicknesses cannot be avoided during the grinding proc-<br>
ess, the gold bronze pigments that are produced in this manner do not exhibit the<br>
luster that is calculated from the reflectivity of the alloys. Additionally, virtually<br>
all gold bronze pigments that are produced via grinding processes display leafing<br>
properties, i.e., they float in the medium, which can be attributed to the lubricants<br>
added during the grinding process. The manufacture of non-leafing gold bronze<br>
pigments requires expensive freeing from lubricant.<br>
Attempts to replace genuine gold flakes via iron-oxide-coated mica pigments (G.<br>
Pfaff and R. Maisch, Farbe+Lack, Vol. 2, 1955, p. 89-93) or iron-oxide-coated<br>
aluminum pigments (W. Ostertag, N. Mronga and P. Hauser, Farbe+Lack, Vol.<br>
12, 1987, p. 973-976) do not achieve their objective regarding the required bril-<br>
liance. While it is possible to produce interesting shades of color ranging from<br>
red gold to green gold via interference effects, is has been shown that the high<br>
luster-determining reflection values of metals cannot be achieved via oxidic<br>
planes of reflection.<br>
From US 4,321,087 it is known that metals are deposited onto a carrier sheet and<br>
pigments are obtained after stripping and comminuting.<br>
As a method for producing metallized layers the customary vapor deposition me-<br>
thods (electron beam technology, resistance radiation heated processes) may be<br><br>
be used, which are described in detail, for example in G. Kienel (editor)<br>
"Vakuumbeschichtung Vol. 1-5", VDI-Verlag 1995.<br>
In the case of alloys consisting of two or more components, a fractionating occurs<br>
due to different vapor pressures. Different evaporation methods (flash evapora-<br>
tion, simultaneous method, or jumping beam method) exist whereby homogene-<br>
ous alloy layers of any desired composition are producible (G. Kienel).<br>
It is the object of the invention to develop a lustrous gold-colored, highly brilliant<br>
metallic effect pigment that does not have the shortcomings of the above-<br>
described real-gold substitute products.<br>
It is a particular object to make available a lustrous gold-colored metallic effect<br>
pigment with plane-parallel surfaces and low uniform particle thickness, so that<br>
the pigment can be applied in all areas of the graphics industry, particularly also<br>
in offset printing.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to make available a lustrous<br>
gold-colored metallic effect pigment in various shades of color ranging from red<br>
gold to green gold.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to make the lustrous gold-<br>
colored metallic effect pigment available in corrosion-stable form, so that no im-<br><br>
pairment in the luster and shade of the products occurs in the customary fields of<br>
application.<br>
It should additionally be producible at economically supportable costs.<br>
These objects are met with a one-layered flake-like metal pigment with plane-<br>
parallel planes of reflection that is composed of a copper-based alloy deposited<br>
by condensation from the vapor phase. Preferred suitable alloy partners are alu-<br>
minum, but also the metals silver, palladium and silicon, either individually or in<br>
combination. The coloristics of the novel lustrous gold-colored pigments are de-<br>
termined predominantly by the ratio of copper to the achromatic alloy compo-<br>
nents. The higher the percentage of copper, the more red gold the flakes are. Sili-<br>
con increases the color depth of the flakes. Typical compositions of flakes with<br>
red gold to yellow gold or green gold luster contain, in addition to copper, 1 to<br>
49% aluminum and optionally 0.1 - 6% silicon. The flake thickness is 10 - 100<br>
nm, preferably 20 - 60 nm and can be varied without difficulty. Very thin flakes<br>
are partially transparent.<br>
One particular characteristic of the lustrous gold-colored pigments are their per-<br>
fect plane-parallel surfaces, their undisturbed structural composition and their<br>
uniform flake thickness, which permits the highest possible reflection values.<br>
The most important steps of the manufacturing process are the application of a<br>
release coat onto a carrier, condensations of the alloy as a film onto the release<br><br>
coat, stripping of the metallic film, comminuting of the film, and optionally siz-<br>
ing of the pigment particles. The vaporizing of the metals in vacuo takes place<br>
according to known methods using the ready-made alloys or the individual met-<br>
als.<br>
The inventive pigments exhibit the highest degree of brilliance and are suffi-<br>
ciently corrosion-stable in many fields of application. If a special corrosion stabil-<br>
ity is required it is possible to improve the stability of the highly lustrous pig-<br>
ments through surface coating. The surface coatings are generally sufficiently<br>
thin and have virtually no impact on the luster behavior of the metal flakes. Sur-<br>
face coatings to improve the corrosion behavior may be applied in the vacuum<br>
chamber in the course of the metal film deposition, for example through vacuum<br>
deposition of SiOx on both sides of the metal film, or via wet-chemical methods<br>
during or after comminuting of the film. Depending on the requirement, protec-<br>
tive coatings of SiO2, Al2O3, phosphate, phosphoric ester, phosphinic acid, si-<br>
lanes, or combinations of these compounds have proven effective.<br>
The lustrous gold-colored metal flakes are used for lacquers, paints, dyes, prin-<br>
ter's inks, plastic coloring, cosmetics, glass and ceramics.<br>
The following is an explanation in detail:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel effect pigment composed of an alloy. An<br>
alloy, in this context, is understood to mean the solid solution of two or more<br><br>
metals. Surprisingly it is possible to deposit coloristically suitable alloys from the<br>
vapor phase in vacuo. Pigments that consist of alloys and are produced by simul-<br>
taneous condensation of metal vapors have not been known until now.<br>
Suitable alloys for the development of brilliant genuine-gold substitute pigments<br>
via PVD processes are copper-based and contain, for example, as additional alloy<br>
components, aluminum and/or silver, palladium and silicon. Among these listed<br>
metals, aluminum is the preferred alloy partner of copper, not only because of its<br>
superior reflectivity and low specific weight. Silver and palladium percentages in<br>
the deposited alloy increase the corrosion stability of the lustrous gold-colored<br>
metal flakes, silicon influences the coloristics. The metals may be evaporated<br>
individually or as previously molten alloys.<br>
Coloristically, a wide range between red gold, pale gold and green cold can be<br>
created via the composition of the deposited alloy. The color-imparting copper<br>
plays the main role in this context. The surfaces of pigments with 90 wt. % cop-<br>
per, for example, have a red gold luster, whereas those with only 60 wt. % copper<br>
appear pale yellow. Silicon has a brightness-reducing effect and becomes appar-<br>
ent visually in a greater color depth of the lustrous gold-colored flakes.<br>
Coloristically interesting compositions lie, for example, at 90 - 99% copper,<br>
10 - 1% aluminum. If very thin flakes are present, they may display partial trans-<br>
parency. Interference effects may have minor impacts on the above-described<br>
coloristics.<br><br>
The thickness of the lustrous gold-colored metal flakes can be adjusted and con-<br>
trolled without difficulty via the evaporation rate of the metals and via the belt<br>
speed. For economic reasons, the belt speeds are generally selected between 2<br>
and 5 m/sec. Metal film thicknesses between 10 and 100 nm may be selected in<br>
the process, as desired. For the manufacture of lustrous gold-colored metal flakes,<br>
thicknesses between 20 and 60 nm are of particular interest. The particle size is<br>
adjusted after stripping the metal films from the carrier sheet through mechanical<br>
comminuting of the film fragments. The comminuting may take place with suit-<br>
able agitators, pumps, or with the aid of ultrasound units of the film fragments<br>
that are suspended in a solvent. Generally, particle sizes between 3 and 150 µm,<br>
preferably between 5 and 50 µm are of interest. As with all effect pigments, the<br>
optical appearance may be varied by means of sizing, i.e., setting narrow particle<br>
size distributions with different mean diameters. The sizing may be performed,<br>
for example, in a decanter.<br>
The characteristic properties of the gold-colored metal flakes are their high re-<br>
flectability and a very high tinctorial power of the pigment in the application. The<br>
high reflectability is based on the mirror-smooth undisturbed surfaces and the<br>
uniform thickness of the flakes. Potential scatter centers are reduced to a mini-<br>
mum. The high tinctorial power of the pigment is based on the low thickness of<br>
the individual particles so that a sufficient degree of coverage can be attained<br>
already with a comparably small amount of pigment.<br><br>
The inventive pigments are produced in such a way that a carrier sheet, for exam-<br>
ple a PET film or a continuous metal belt is optionally coated with a release coat.<br>
The coating of the carrier sheet with a soluble resin or wax may be performed via<br>
a dipping or imprinting method.<br>
The appropriate metals are then evaporated individually or as pre-molten alloy<br>
for example in one or more evaporators under high vacuum and condensed onto<br>
the carrier sheet.<br>
The metal film is subsequently stripped and comminuted to pigment particle size<br>
in a solvent suitable for the application, such as isopropanol, isopropylacetate,<br>
ehtylacetate or glycol ether by means of a suitable agitator or a pump that exerts<br>
high shearing forces. Ultrasound comminuting may be used in addition or alterna-<br>
tively. Optionally, the pigment particles are also sized.<br>
To protect the metal surfaces of the inventive pigments from corrosion, it is pos-<br>
sible to provide them in an additional step with anticorrosive layers. Since these<br>
layers are thin and low refracting, they have virtually no influence on the optical<br>
behavior of the pigments. In principle, two methods of applying anticorrosive<br>
layers are possible: on one hand by vapor deposition of a double-sided protective<br>
layer during the evaporation process, on the other hand by precipitation of a pas-<br>
sivating layer during or after comminuting of the film fragments. The vapor de-<br>
position of protective layers during the evaporating process is performed in the<br>
sequence protective layer, alloy film, protective layer, for which low-soluble but<br><br>
easily evaporated materials are generally selected, such as SiOx or MgF2. The<br>
precipitation of a passivation layer is performed as a wet-chemical reaction. The<br>
precipitation of a thin SiO2 layer, expediently via a sol-gel process through hy-<br>
drolysis of silanes and subsequent silanol treatment has proven suitable, also the<br>
precipitation of aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, phosphate, phosphoric acid,<br>
phosphoric esters, phosphinic acid, silanes, organically modified silicates, titan-<br>
ates, zirconates or methacrylate-based polymer layers or combinations of these<br>
compounds.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below based on preferred em-<br>
bodiments.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a roll coater by firm Leybold Heraeus, a PET carrier film of 48 µm thickness,<br>
which is coated with a release coat, is coated with a copper/aluminum alloy under<br>
high vacuum. The release coat consists of acetone-soluble methylmethacrylate<br>
resin and is printed on in advance in a separate processing step. The vacuum is<br>
adjusted to 5.10-4 mbar.<br>
The speed with which the carrier film is unwound is 4 m/s. The copper/aluminum<br>
alloy with a copper content of 92% is evaporated in a boat via resistance heating<br>
at a rate that results in a metal film thickness on the moving carrier sheet of 40<br>
run. After completion of the coating the roll coater is flooded with nitrogen, the<br><br>
metallized PET roll is removed and treated with acetone in a stripping station.<br>
Through dissolving of the release coat the metal film is separated from the carrier<br>
film. The metallic film fragments are concentrated in a centrifuge and separated<br>
from the release-coat containing acetone solution. The filter cake is then entered<br>
into an isopropanol solution, where the film is comminuted over the course of 20<br>
minutes. The suspension in which the metal flakes are present is a 12% suspen-<br>
sion.<br>
The obtained pigment suspension exhibits lustrous gold-colored pigment particles<br>
of the highest brilliance. The mean particle size of the flakes is 10 µm (Cilas).<br>
Chemical analyses show that the pigment contains 92% copper and 8% alumi-<br>
num. X-ray analyses reveal that the elements are present in homogenous alloy<br>
form.<br>
Example 2<br>
a) In the set-up described in example 1, a copper-aluminum-silicon film is depos-<br>
ited. This is performed analogous to example 1, with the difference that, in addi-<br>
tion to the evporation source for copper/aluminum, an additional one is installed<br>
for silicon. The copper/aluminum alloy that is made available for the evaporation<br>
contains 94% copper. The thickness of the film that is precipitated from the vapor<br>
phase is set to 45 nm. Stripping of the film and comminuting of the film frag-<br>
ments to pigment size takes place as in example 1.<br><br>
The pigment that is obtained in suspension has a deep red golden luster. It con-<br>
tains 2% silicon. The mean particle size, according to Cilas measurements, is 11<br>
µm.<br>
b) Stabilization:<br>
1000 g of the above produced 12% pigment suspension in isopropanol are heated<br>
to the boiling point and 11 g tetraethoxysilane and 10 g water are added. A 10%<br>
aqueous solution DMEA is subsequently added using a Dosimat until a pH of 8 is<br>
reached. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours while maintaining the pH. 1.4 g di-<br>
phenyl dimethoxysilane, which is dissolved in 12 g isopropanol, is then evenly<br>
dosed in over the course of 4 hours while stirring. Subsequently, 0.5 g 3-<br>
aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (Dynasilan AMMO) are added and the mixture is<br>
cooled over the course of 10 hours while stirring.<br>
The metal pigment is then present in a corrosion-stabilized form.<br><br>
