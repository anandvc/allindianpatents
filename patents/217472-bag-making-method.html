	October 29,2002.<br>
20 	Description of Related Art<br>
		In recent years, a medical container formed by using a synthetic resin is often<br>
	used in place of a glass-made medical container. The synthetic resin-made medical<br>
	container includes a container produced by blow molding and a container produced from<br>
	a film or a sheet (hereinafter, a film and a sheet are collectively called a "film") obtained<br>
25	 by inflation molding or T-die casting. Among these, a container produced from a film<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
2<br>
	(hereinafter referred to as a "film bag") is increasing, because the film bag is thin and<br>
	uniform in the container thickness and can be reduced in the volume after use, the waste<br>
	is therefore less generated and at the transfusion, the discharging rate of liquid content<br>
	can be kept almost constant until the last. In the film bag, a mouth member which is a<br>
5	 hollow cylindrical body formed of a synthetic resin and having a three-dimensional shape<br>
	as shown in Fig, 1 is fixed by heat sealing so as to enable filling or discharging of the<br>
	content. The mouth member has a hollow circular or elliptic cross-section in many<br>
	cases.<br>
		In the fixing of the mouth member to the film, a three-dimensionally shaped<br>
	10 member must be fixed to a two-dimensional planar film and as shown in Fig. 2, a gap 22<br>
	is sometimes generated between the A-frame part of the film and the melt-bonding part<br>
	of the mouth member (hereinafter referred to as a "A-frame part gap") to cause leakage<br>
	of the liquid content. Particularly, in the case of a thick, film having a film thickness of<br>
	100 pm or more, the film is deformed in agreement with the shape of the month member<br>
15	 at the heat sealingj though this may vary depending on the shape of the mouth member,<br>
	and the once sealed portion is sometimes separated due to restoring stress of the film.<br>
	Furthermore, on melt-bonding the mouth member amd the film by sandwiching these<br>
	with a sealing mold, the film is subject to an excess tensile stress so as to agree with the<br>
	shape of the mouth member and this bears a risk of thinning the film or forming a hole in<br>
20	 the firm.<br>
		For preventing such deformation or hole formation of film, a method of stacking<br>
	a heat-resistant layer on the film by using an adhesive to obtain a laminate film enhanced<br>
	in the heat resistance is known. However, use of an adhesive is not preferred in the<br>
	medical field because the adhesive sometimes dissolves out Accordingly, various<br>
25	 studies have been made for the bonding technique of causing no dissolving out of a<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
3<br>
	material and enabling liquid-tight bonding without generation of a gap between a mouth<br>
	member and a bag unit comprising a single-layer or multilayer film.<br>
		As the container succeeded in solving the problem of the A-frame part gap, a<br>
	container obtained by bonding a bag unit and a mouth member provided with, as shown<br>
5	 in Fig. 3, a thin strip 23 outwardly extending in the left and right sides of the<br>
	melt-bonding part has been proposed.<br>
		Specific examples of the method for producing a container by bonding a<br>
	container body and a mouth member provided with a thin strip outwardly extending in<br>
	the left and right sides of the melt-bonding part include: a method of producing a mouth<br>
10	member having previously provided thereon thin strips by using a preheating jig and then<br>
	heat-sealing it to a transfusion bag (see, Patent Document 1);<br>
		a method of melting the surface of an opening plug at a temperature higher by<br>
15	 to 80XXXC than the melting point of the material for the opening plug before the opening<br>
	plug comes into contact with a film or a sheet, simultaneously forming a fuse-bonding<br>
15	 tab in the width of 0.2 to 3 mm on both sides of the opening plug, and pressing two<br>
	sheets of film or sheet to the opening plug from the symmetrical directions to fuse-bond<br>
	the films or sheets to the opening plug (see, Patent Document 2);<br>
		a method of providing a protruding part on the outer circumferential face of a<br>
	hollow cylindrical body at symmetrical positions dividing the hollow cylindrical body<br>
20	 into two in the perpendicular axial direction, with the joining part to the hollow<br>
	cylindrical body being narrowed, heating and softening the protruding parts and then<br>
	abutting a sheet to the protruding parts and hollow cylindrical body in the softened state<br>
	(see, Patent Document 3);<br>
		a method of heat-sealing an inflation tube to a mouth part having fin-like<br>
25	 protrusions formed by a metal mold and thereby producing a bag (see, Patent Document<br><br>
WO 2W4/039562 PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
4<br>
4); and<br>
		a method of, before melt-bonding an opening plug to a film or a sheet, heating<br>
	the surface layer at the melt-bonding part of the opening plug in the temperature range<br>
	from the softening temperature of the material for the melt-bonding part of the opening<br>
5	 plug to a temperature 13XXXC higher than the melting point by utilizing radiation heat of a<br>
	heater at a temperature of 600 to 800°C, pressing the heated opening plug from both<br>
	sides by fin-forming metal molds symmetrical with respect to the opening plug to form<br>
	fin-like thin strips on the opening plug, inserting the opening plug still in the heated state <br>
	between films or sheets, and melt-bonding the opening plug to the films or sheets by a<br>
	10 heat-sealing mold (see, Patent Document 5).<br>
		These are a method of producing a month member having previously provided<br>
	thereon a thin strip outwardly extending in the left and right sides of the mouth member<br>
	at the part to be melt-bonded to a film, and then bonding the mouth member to a bag unit.<br>
	Such a method not only requires an excess step for forming a thin strip but also<br>
15	 encounters problems at the formation of the thin strip, such as fluctuation in the size of<br>
	thin strip, unevexmess in the size between left and right thin strips and attachment of<br>
	carbide debris from the thin strip-forming mold. In addition, the previously formed thin<br>
	strip may be deformed, for example, may be shrunk, distorted or Men down.<br>
	Furthermore, the heating is readily accompanied with defoimation of the mouth member<br>
20	 due to release of a residual stress in the melt-bonding part generated at the injection<br>
	molding of the mouth member, as a result, the positions of the mouth member, bag unit<br>
	and sealing mold cannot he exactly adjusted at the bonding of the mouth member to the<br>
	bag unit, resulting in unsatisfactory bonding. Accordingly, improvements for more<br>
	completely preventing the generation of a A-frame part gap are being demanded .<br>
25 		Particularly, in the case of a large size mouth member wilh a diameter exceeding<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention has been made under these circumstances and a main<br>
20	 object of the present invention is to provide a bag-making method for obtaining a bag<br>
	with a mouth member, having excellent liquid tightness at the melt-bonded part between<br>
	the mouth member and the bag unit, where the mouth member is reduced as much as<br>
	possible in the deformation of the melt-bonding part at the preheating, the number of<br>
	steps is small, and the generation of the A-frame part gap can be stably prevented.<br>
25 Asa result of extensive investigations on the bag-making method of producing a<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
6<br>
	bag by melt-bonding a mouth member and a bag unit and capable of preventing the<br>
	generation of A-frame part gap, the present inventors have found that the mouth member<br>
	produced by injection molding has a residual stress generated at the injection molding,<br>
	this residual stress is released by the heating at the formation of thin strips on tie mouth<br>
5	 member or at the preliminary heating, thereby causing deformation, and this defoirnation<br>
	makes it difficult to exactly determine relative positions of the mouth member, bag unit<br>
	and sealing mold and gives rise to generation of harmful local contact or gap between the<br>
	sealing mold and the bag unit, as a result, uniform and stable sealing can be hardly <br>
	attained. Accordingly, it has been found that by suppressing the deformation of the<br>
	10 month member, a uniform thin strip can be stably formed, the generation of A-frame part<br>
	gap can be prevented and at the same time, the bag unit in the vicinity of the mouth<br>
	member can be prevented from thinning of film due to heating at the end part of the<br>
	month member. The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
		More specifically, the present invention relate to a bag-making method described<br>
15	 in I) to 7) below.<br>
		That is, the above-described object can be attained by developing:<br>
		1) a bag-making method for producing a bag by mett-bonding and thereby<br>
	integrating a mouth member formed of a preliminarily heated synthetic resin and a bag<br>
	unit formed of a flexible film, the method comprising a preliminary heating step of<br>
20	 softening the synthetic Tesin of the mouth member at the part melt-bonded to the bag unit,<br>
	which is a melt-bonding part of mouth member while preventing the synthetic resin of<br>
	the mouth member at the end part in the bag side, which is an end part of mouth<br>
	member from being softened at the preliminary heating, and a melt-bonding step of<br>
	inserting the preliminarily heated mouth member into the opening of the bag unit and<br>
25	 pressing them by a sealing mold to melt-bond the melt-bonding part of the mouth<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention is described in detail below by referring to the drawings.<br>
		The mouth member 1 works out to an injection inlet/outlet of a bag and the<br>
	cross-section thereof has a hollow circular, elliptic, rhombic or boat form, Also, one<br>
25	 mouth member may have a plurality of injection inlets/outlets<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
9<br>
		In the case where the mouth member 1 has a circular cross-section, the diameter<br>
	is from 10 to 30 nun, the thickness of the mouth member is from 0.5 to 3 mm and the<br>
	height is approximately from 20 to 80 mm.<br>
		Examples of the synthetic resin used for the mouth member include polyester<br>
5	 resins such as polyethylene terephthakte and polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate<br>
	resins, and polyolefin-base resins such as polypropylene and polyethylene. Among<br>
	these, preferred are polyoiefm-base resins, more preferred is a single resin or a blended<br>
	resin of polyethylene-base resins such as high-density polyethylene, linear low-density<br>
	polyethylene, high-pressure process low-density polyethylene and polyethylene produced<br>
10	by using a rnetallocene catalyst. The same resin as the flexible film constituting the bag<br>
	unit is preferably used.<br>
		The mouth member 1 may comprise multiple layers. In particular, it is<br>
	preferred that the same resin as the flexible film is used for the outermost layer of the<br>
	mouth member and a resin higher in the heat resistance and rigidity than the outer layer is<br>
15	 used for the innermost layer, because the mouth member is more suppressed from the<br>
	deformation at the preliminary heating and at the same time, when an injection needle is<br>
	erroneously pieced inside the mouth member, the needle is prevented from piereing from<br>
	the inside to the outside on the side surface of the mouth member.<br>
		The bag unit 2 comprises a flexible film and examples of the construction<br>
20	 material thereof include polyolefin resins such as polypropylene and polyethylene,<br>
	polyamide resins and polyester resins. A construction material having a melting point<br>
	approximated to that of the melt-bonding face 12 of the mouth member 1 or a<br>
	polyolefin-base resin obtained by blending such resins is preferred. The flexible film<br>
	may have either a single-layer structure or a multilayer structure and the thickness thereof<br>
25	 is approximately from 100 to 400 μm. In the case of a multilayer laminate film, a<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
10<br>
	construction material of the same resin as and approximated in the melting point to the<br>
	melt-bonding face of the mouth member or a resin obtained by blending such materials is<br>
	preferably used for the inner surface of the bag unit For the flexible film, a cylindrical<br>
	film produced by inflation molding or a bag material obtained by folding a film produced<br>
5	 by T'die casting or the like or superposing the films is used.<br>
		In the bag-making method of the present invention, the melt-bonding is<br>
	performed after the mouth member 1 formed of a synthetic resin is preliminarily heated.<br>
	The mouth member 1 is produced by injection molding in almost all cases and the <br>
	present inventors have found that the residual stress generated at the injection molding<br>
	10 and confined in the mouth member is released at the preliminary heating to deform the<br>
	mouth member and therefore, when the deformed mouth member 1 is pressed together<br>
	with the bag unit 2 by a sealing mold 5, the contact with the film of the bag unit 2<br>
	becomes non-uniform, as a result, local contact or gap is generated between the mouth<br>
	member 1 and the film of the bag unit 2 before the melt-bonding. More specifically, the<br>
15	 relative positional relationship among the month member 1, bag unit 2 and sealing mold<br>
	5 changes due to the deformation of the mouth member and the A-frame part gap cannot <br>
	be filled with the mouth member resin in some cases. For constantly establishing a<br>
	preferred relative positional relationship among the mouth member 1, bag unit 2 and<br>
	sealing mold 5, the mouth member 1 should be prevented from deforming at the<br>
20	 preliminary heating. The present inventors have found that the deformation can he<br>
	prevented by performing the preliminary heating without softening the end part 11 of the<br>
	mouth member, as a result, the mouth member 1, bag unit 2 and sealing mold 5 can be<br>
	adjusted to respective exact positions and the bag unit 2 and mouth member 1 can be<br>
	melt-bonded without generating an A-frame part gap.<br>
25 Conventionally, the mouth member 1 and 1he bag unit 2 have been melt-bonded<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
11<br>
	by defining the melt-bonding part of the mouth member to the portion of the mouth<br>
	member excluding the upper part 13 of the mouth member, to which a rubber plug is<br>
	fixed, and heating the mouth member until the melt-bonding part is softened. However,<br>
	in order to suppress the deformation of the mouth member 1, when the end part 11 in the<br>
5	 bag side of the mouth member, which is an end part of mourn member as well as the<br>
	upper part 13 of the mouth member are not heated and thereby not softened, the mouth<br>
	member as a whole is prevented from defonning, the positional precision of the mouth<br>
	member, bag unit and sealing mold is enhanced, the contact property is improved,<br>
	uniform melt-bonding and formation of thin strips at the melt-bonding part of the mouth<br>
	10 member are realized and melt-bonding free of a gap in the A-frame part between the bag<br>
	unit and the mouth member can be achieved. According to conventional methods, the<br>
	end part of the mouth member is also heated and depending on the case, heated to a<br>
	temperature higher than the melting point of film, as a result, thinning of film is readily<br>
	generated in the vicinity of the end part of the mouth member at the sealing of the mouth<br>
15	 member I and the bag unit 2. This problem can also be solved by the above-described<br>
	technique. The partial thinning of film is prevented and therefore, the bag falling<br>
	strength of the container body is improved.<br>
		The "softening" as used herein means a state where the resin is softened to such<br>
	a degree that the surface of the melt-bonding part of the mouth member pressed by a<br>
20	 sealing mold through a film is melt-bonded to the film and at the same time, a thin strip<br>
	is formed. The non-softened end part of me mouth member is confirmed with an eye to<br>
	have the same surface state as the surface of the mouth member before the preliminary<br>
	heating. In this case, a clear boundary line is observed at the boundary between the end<br>
	part of the mouth part and 1he melt-bonding part of the mouth member before the<br>
25	 pressing by a sealing mold. By preliminarily heating the mourn member to provide a<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
12<br>
	state that this boundary line is observed with an eye, the object of the present invention<br>
	can be achieved.<br>
		In the preliminary heating, direct heating by using a hot mold or heating by<br>
	radiation heat from a heat source such as annular heater or far infrared ray is employed<br>
5	 and the surface temperature of the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth member to the bag<br>
	unit, which is a melt bonding part of mouth member is set to a temperature where the<br>
	synthetic resin used for the mouth member is softened.<br>
		Among these heating methods, heating by radiation heat is advantageous in view <br>
	of attachment of foreign matters and simplification of the machine structure and therefore,<br>
	10 this method is preferred. For the preheater 3, an annular heater having a shape of not<br>
	heating the end part 11 of the mouth member is preferably used. Figs. 4A and 4B each<br>
	is a cross-sectional view showing one example of the mouth member during preliminary<br>
	heating with an annular heater 31 covered by 33 heat insulating material. The clearance<br>
	between the mouth member 1 and the preheatei 3 can also be maintained to a higher<br>
15	 precision by fitting the mouth member 1 at the non-heating part 34 of the annular heater<br>
	or fitting a support into the hollow part of the mouth member 1 from the upper portion of <br>
	Figs. 4A and B, thereby supporting the mouth member at least at two portions to keep the<br>
	exact spatial arrangement of the mouth member 1 and the annular heater. Furthermore,<br>
	when the mouth member is rotated, the quantity of heat received from the preheater 3 can<br>
20	 be made uniform over the entire circumference of the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth<br>
	member. When the quantity of heat applied to the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth<br>
	member at the preliminary heating step is stabilized and homogenized, the deformation<br>
	of the mouth member 1 is more suppressed and the positional adjustment of the mouth<br>
	body, bag unit and sealing mold can be more exactly performed<br>
25 		The heating temperature must be a temperature sufficiently high to form a thin<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
13<br>
	strip on the mouth member at the time of pressing the mouth member through a film in<br>
	the melt-bonding step. In the case of heating by radiation heat, the heating temperature<br>
	can be appropriately selected According to the clearance between the heat source and the<br>
	month member surface, or the construction material of the mouth member, but the<br>
5	 heating is preferably performed for 8 to 13 seconds by setting the heal source at a<br>
	temperature of 500 to 750°C, though this may vary depending on the construction<br>
	material of the mouth member. If the temperature of the melt-bonding part 12 of the<br>
	mouth member is too high, a degraded product of synthetic resin may be generated or<br>
	flow deformation may occur and furthermore, the end part of the mouth member may be<br>
	10 softened due to the effect of the temperature at the melt-bonding part of the mouth<br>
	member, therefore, this must be avoided.<br>
		To speak specifically, in order to not soften the end part 11 of the mouth member<br>
	and soften the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth member, the end part 11 of the mouth<br>
	member is, for example, protruded by at least 0.5 mm or more, preferably 0.8 mm or<br>
15	 more, than the heat source such as annular heater, whereby the end part 11 of the mouth<br>
	member can effectively avoid being affected by the radiation heat and softened, as a<br>
	result, the mouth member as a whole can be prevented from reduction in the rigidity and<br>
	deformation due to heat.<br>
		Other examples include, as shown in Fig. 4B, a method of using heat insulating<br>
20	 means such as heat insulating plate 32 for preventing the end part 11 of the mouth<br>
	member from being subjected to radiation heat from a heat source and, although not<br>
	shown, a method of cooling the end part of the mouth member by abutting thereto a<br>
	cooling mold having a circular cap-like recessed portion into which the end part of the<br>
	mouth member is entered. Furthermore, the object of the present invention can also be<br>
25	 achieved, as shown in Figs, 5 A and 5B, by using a mouth member where the diameter is<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
14<br>
	reduced at the end part 11 of the mouth member in the region in a length L of 5 mm or<br>
	less, preferably from 1 to 5 mm, from the lowermost portion 14 of the mouth member so<br>
	as to enlarge the distance of the end part 11 of the mouth member from the heat source as<br>
	compared with the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth member.<br>
5 		The melt-bonding step of pressing and thereby melt-bonding the mouth member<br>
	and the bag unit is a step of inserting the preliminarily heated mouth member into the<br>
	opening of the bag unit and pressing them by a sealing mold to melt-bond the<br>
	melt-bonding part of the mouth member to the opening. An example of the <br>
	melt-bonding step is described below by referring to Fig. 6. In the following example, a<br>
	10 mouth member supported by a cylindrical body is inserted into the opening of a bag unit<br>
	and the bag unit is depressurized and is melt-bonded to the mouth member. The method<br>
	by depressurization is more effective in the case inhere the diameter of the mouth<br>
	member exceeds 1 0 mm. An analogous method is described b Patent Document 6.<br>
		For facilitating the holding of the mouth member, as shown in Fig. 6, a<br>
15	 cylindrical body 4 is inserted into the hollow part of a hollow cylindrical mouth member<br>
	XXX<br>
		The cylindrical body has an outer diameter slightly smaller than the inner<br>
	diameter of the mouth member and in the inside thereof a hole is penetrated to the distal<br>
	end The distal end (air suction inlet 43) of the cylindrical body is formed to give a<br>
20	 shape conforming to the bent film, that is, a shape where the sectional area gradually<br>
	decreases toward the distal end of the cylindrical body.<br>
		The sectional area starts gradually decreasing at the position 5 mm or more from<br>
	the distal end of the cylindrical body and at the same time, closer to the distal end than<br>
	the end part 11 of the mouth member. The cylindrical body is inserted such that the<br>
25	 distal end 43 of the cylindrical body protrudes at least 5 mm or more from the end part 11<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
15<br>
	of the mouth member. The inside of the bag unit is depressurized by suctioning air<br>
	therein, which is described later, and thereby the cylindrical body 4 and the bag is more<br>
	tightly contacted. Furthermore, if the cylindrical body 4 is served also as a fixing jig for<br>
	the mouth member 1 in the preliminary heating step, this may provide an effect of more<br>
5	 preventing the deformation of the mouth member, however, since the machine structure<br>
	is complicated, that is, the machine structure needs to be constituted by taking account of<br>
	the difference between the sealing time (time period where the sealing mold is pressed)<br>
	and the preliminary heating time, the equipment is slightly complicated and this gives<br>
	rise to increase in the cost,<br>
10 		If desired, the inside of the bag unit is depressurized by suctioning air by the<br>
	depressurization port 42 therein to enhance the tight contact between the cylindrical body<br>
	4 and the bag 2. The timing of depressurization is before the sealing mold 5 is secured<br>
	or simultaneously with the closing of the sealing mold 5. The bag unit is fixed by the<br>
	depressurization and therefore, troubles such as thinning of film or generation of pinhole<br>
15	 at the boundary between the melt-bonding part and the non-melt-bonding part due to the<br>
	effect of heat from the sealing mold 5 can be very efficiently prevented from occurring.<br>
	Furthermore, the bag unit 2 and the mouth member 1 are strongly contacted by the<br>
	depressurization and therefore at the cylindrical support part 41, the film is bent and<br>
	fixed in agreement with the shape of the end part 11 of the mouth member. In additions,<br>
20	 due to the low temperature at the end part of the mouth member, the thinning is inhibited<br>
	with good efficiency.<br>
		The bag unit 2 and the mouth member 1 are pressed by a sealing mold 5 shown<br>
	in Fig, 7 to melt-bond the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth member and the<br>
	melt-bonding part 21 of the bag unit The temperature of the sealing mold 5 is higher<br>
25	 by 10XXXC or more than the melting point of film (bag unit resin) and in the case of a film<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
16<br>
	formed of a polyethylene resin, this temperature is from 110 to 170°C and the<br>
	melt-bonding time is approximately from 1 to 3 seconds. The time period after the<br>
	preliminary heating until the pressing by the sealing mold 5 is preferably as short as<br>
	possible, but due to the limitation by the production apparatus, this time period is usually<br>
5	 on the order of 1 to 4 seconds. If this time period exceeds 4 seconds, the surface<br>
	temperature at the melt-bonding part of the mouth member decreases and the sealing<br>
	strength between the mouth member 1 and the bag unit 2 is jiable to be insufficient. At<br>
	the melt-bonding, when the comer of the mold has a small R as shown in Fig. 7B, a thin <br>
	strip can be easily formed.<br>
10		The sealing mold 5 has a shape comprising a semicircular cross-section and a<br>
	flat part and R is formed at the connection part of the semicircular cross-section and the<br>
	flat part, that is, at the A-frame part between the mouth member 1 and the film, R is<br>
	from 02 to 2 mm, preferably from 03 to 1.7 mm. If R. is too large, formation of the<br>
	A-frame part gap cannot be prevented, whereas if it is too small, troubles are readily<br>
15	 generated, for example, the film is scratched or an insufficient thin strip is formed. The<br>
	diameter of the semicircular cross-section is slightly smaller than the size obtained by<br>
	adding the film thickness to the diameter of the melt-bonding part 12 of the mouth<br>
	member. Also, the sealing mold 5 is preferably designed to perform the melt-bonding<br>
	without heating the region at least 0.5 mm from the lowermost portion of the end part of<br>
20	 the mouth member so that thinning of the film can be avoided. Examples of such a<br>
	sealing mold 5 include a mold having a shape such that the region in a length of at least<br>
	0.5 mm from the lowermost side of the end part of the mouth member is controlled to a<br>
	temperature lower than the melting point of the film. A preferred sealing mold is a<br>
	mold of, as shown in Fig, 8, allowing the mouth member 1 to protrude by a length of M<br>
25	 from the sealing mold 5. The length M is prderably 0.5mm or more. With this lengthy<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
17<br>
	the film is not pressed between the distal end of the mouth member and the mold and<br>
	thinning of the film is hand to occur. In this time, this film may be the part of a medical<br>
	container 6 shown in Fig.9.<br>
		In this example, the mouth member and the bag unit are melt-bonded while the<br>
5	 bag unit is depressurized, however, the effect of the present invention can also be<br>
	achieved by softening the melt-bonding part ] of the mouth part, where the mouth<br>
	member 1 and the bag unit 2 are melt-bonded, while preventing the end part 11 of the<br>
	mouth member from being softened at the preliminary heating, and pressing the mouth<br>
	member 1 and the bag unit 2 without using a cylindrical body.<br>
10 		In the mouth member 1 heated at the preliminary heating step of the present<br>
	invention, the residual stress generated at the injection molding is eliminated and the<br>
	deformation is prevented, as a result, the mouth member I and the bag unit 2 each can be<br>
	fitted to the exact position with respect to the sealing mold 5. Since these are<br>
	melt-bonded in such an exactly positioned state, the softened resin in the melt-bonding<br>
15	 part 12 of the mouth member pressed to the flexible film forms a thin strip having a<br>
	stable shape and extending in the A-frame part gap.<br>
		The thin strip suitably has a size such mat the thickness is approximately from<br>
	50 to 200 μm and the length is approximately front 0.1 to 2 mm. According to the<br>
	present invention, the mouth member comes to have a thin strip of this size and by<br>
20	 melt-bonding the mouth member, a bag with a mouth member free fiom formation of<br>
	A-frame part gap and generation of liquid leakage can be stably produced.<br>
		After the mouth member is melt-bonded, the melt-bonding part is sandwiched<br>
	by a cooling mold. Since the deformation of the mouth member at the preliminary<br>
	heating is prevented, similarly to the sandwiching by a sealing mold, the material to be<br>
25	 sandwiched can be exactly and stably positioned also at the sandwiching by a cooling<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
18<br>
	mold and therefore, a thin strip is stably molded.<br>
		In the case where the inside of the bag unit has been depressurized, the<br>
	depressurization is released. By performing the melt-bonding and cooling in the<br>
	depressurized state, the film is tightly contacted and fixed in agreement with the shape of<br>
5	 nozzle until the film is melt-bonded with the mouth member by a film sealing mold and<br>
	cooled. The melt-bonding is performed as such in the state where the film is inhibited<br>
	from free movement, and this provides aa effect that the melted and softened film is not<br>
	stretched and the fihn is not thinned at the boundary of the melt-bonding part and the <br>
	non-melt-bonding part of the mouth member.<br>
10 	Examples<br>
		A mouth member formed of an equivalent blend composition of high-density<br>
	polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene and having a circular cross-sectional<br>
	shape was produced by injection molding, where the diameter was 17 mm, the inner<br>
	diameter was 13 mm and the thickness at the melt-bonding part and the end part of the<br>
15	 mouth member was 2 mm.<br>
		A tubular linear low-density polyethylene film having a width of 140 mm was<br>
	formed by inflation molding and cut into a length of 300 mm. One cut part was closed<br>
	by heat sealing and another cut part was used as the melt-bonding part of the opening.<br>
	On the other hand, an annular heater designed such that the surface temperature at the<br>
20	 radiation part becomes 700°C and the end part of the mouth member protrudes by 1 mm<br>
	from the radiation part was inserted into the mouth member while aligning the center<br>
	with the center of the month member and heated for 10 seconds. After a hollow<br>
	cylindrical body was fit into the mouth member, the mouth member was swiftly inserted<br>
	into the melt-boning part of the bag unit prepared above and simultaneously with<br>
25	 auctioning by a vacuum pump to depressurize the inside of the bag unit, the melt-bonding<br><br>
WO 2004/039562 	PCT/JP2003/013877<br>
19<br>
	part was sandwiched by a sealing mold set at 140°C for 2 seconds. Subsequently, the<br>
	melt-bonding part was sandwiched by a cooling mold for 3 seconds and after the vacuum<br>
	was relieved, the hollow cylindrical body was pulled out to produce a bag with a mouth<br>
	member.<br>
5 	100 Units of this bag with a mouth member were prepared and after filling 500<br>
	mL of water into each bag and tightly plugging it, the bag was externally pressed to give<br>
	an internal pressure of 0.07 MPa and then left standing for 5 minutes. In all bags with a<br>
	mouth member, water leakage was not observed.<br>
		While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
10	illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and<br>
	are not to be considered as limiting. Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other<br>
	modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present<br>
	invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the<br>
	foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.<br>
