				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION; The present invention relates to a Physical separation process scheme of valuable minerals from residual process slurry and particularly relates to separation of important base metals in their sulfide forms from Mineral Beneficiation Process Tailings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Rampura Agucha Mine, a captive mine of Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL), India is one of the major Lead-Zinc deposits in the world. The mineral beneficiation process at Rampura Agucha Mines leads to the present generation of 3.2 million tpa of process Tailing containing some amount of unrealized base metals. Apart from the above mentioned stream, the existing Tailing Dam also contains significant volume of Tailings.<br>
At present, Fresh Tailings contain 1.3-1.4% Zn on an average most of the time, while the distribution spread can exist between 1.2-1.8% Zn (Depending on the Ore Feed Grade to the Plant and Plant operating conditions).<br>
Tailing Dam contains operational tailings since inception of Rampura Agucha Mine operation and thus has wide spread of variation from 1.3-3% of Zn content.<br>
General Mineralogy of Fresh Tailings is-98% of the gangue minerals are in liberated form and liberated Sphalerite grains constitute 0.5%. In the Sphalerite spectrum 23% are in liberated form whose average size is 20-40 microns but are predominantly around 25 microns and 77% are in locked form whose average size is around 20-30 microns as complex locks, of which bimineral locking with gangue accounts for 60-65% and bimineral locking with pyrite accounts for 20%. In the galena spectrum 0% are in liberated form and 100% are in unliberated form whose size is around 20 microns, but intergrowths persist upto 5 microns as fine grained intergrowths and wherein locking with gangue accounts for 85% and with Sphalerite accounts for 10%. The iron content is accounted predominantly by pyrite and to a lesser extent by pyrrhotite.<br>
Previously several works have been reported in Published journals or symposiums or Patents to propose several new developments to treat low grade Pb-Zn Ores, mineralogically Complex Ores. A few Patents and Publications also proposed different Processes and Equipment to recover Copper , Elemental Sulfur, Oxidized Lead -Silver from different process residues including mineral Beneficiation Tailings. But apart from a Single Publication on marmatite flotation from Zn Tailings at Broken Hill Mines, Australia, no significant research has been reported to recover base metal values from a Tailing stream characteristically similar to Rampura Agucha Tailings.<br>
The present invention is aimed to propose a simple and controlled process scheme developed by extensive Research activities to recover Base Metal values from Rampura Agucha Mine's Tailings or a Mineral Beneficiation Process Tailing having similar characteristics.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The Bulk Flotation process is developed by HZL through it's Research &amp; Development efforts, to produce a Bulk Zn concentrate from Tailings and thus to recover lost metal values in Tailings. The process is basically a flotation process without incorporation of further grinding of Tailings and Bulk concentrate.<br>
In a single aspect, the Process hereby claimed consists of the following steps:<br>
1.	Conditioning of Mineral Beneficiation Process Tailings as the First Step with pH<br>
modifier (Lime), collector (SIPX) and Activator (CuSO4).<br>
2.	Single Stage Rougher Flotation followed by Single Stage Scavenging with the aid<br>
of Frother (MIBC) and control of Air Flow and Cell Levels.<br>
3.	Single Stage Cleaning of Rougher concentrate thus produced with control of pH<br>
and Cell level.<br>
4.	Recycling of Scavenger concentrate and Cleaner Tailing to Roughing stage to aid<br>
in up gradation of Bulk Concentrate quality.<br>
Concentrate thus produced contains 9-12 % Zn, 20-30% Fe, 1-3% Pb and 50-70 ppm Ag. The Bulk Concentrate thus produced is amenable to different Acid Leaching processes without taking aid of Roasting. Heap Bioleaching, Direct Leaching, Microwave assisted Leaching Test Programs have always resulted in more than 90% Zn dissolution. Thus HZL Bulk Flotation Process is capable of scavenging residual Metal values from a Zn-Pb Sulfide Ore Beneficiation Process Tailings in to a Bulk Concentrate, which can be successfully treated by a suitable Hydrometallurgical Leaching-Purification Process to extract valuable Base Metals.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS;<br>
Figure 1 is a brief description of the Process Block Diagram. Figure 2 is a Schematic Flow sheet of the Pilot Facility to carry out the advanced stages of Test work.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
As described in Figure 1, Mineral Beneficiation Process Tailings stream 1 for a Pb-Zn Sulfide ore is conditioned in the first process stage A with the addition of reagents. The reagents used are pH modifier (Lime), collector (SIPX) and activator (CuSC^). The conditioned slurry 2 is floated in Rougher Stage B to recover maximum Base Metals locked in the Tailings. The reagents used are Frother (MIBC), Collector (SIPX). The Rougher Tailings stream 4 is Scavenged in Single Scavenger Stage C to float residual base metals. The reagents used are Collector (SIPX) and activator (CuSO4). The Final Tailing stream 5 is neutralized with Lime and disposed off. Rougher concentrate stream 3 is cleaned in Flotation stage D to produce final Bulk Concentrate stream 8. The reagent used is pH modifier (Lime).The Cleaner Tailings 7 and Scavenger Concentrate 6 are<br>
collected together in a Sump (Stage E) and recycled back (Stream 9) to Stage B. The purpose of this recycling is to increase quality of Bulk Concentrate. Through out the Flotation stages Cell Levels, Cell Air Flows and Reagent Addition Rates are to be monitored to control the Froth generation rate, bubble size and quality of froth.<br>
The Bulk Concentrate thus produced primarily consists of Sulfides of Zinc, Lead, Iron etc. and is amenable for different Acid Leaching Processes (Minimum 90% dissolution of Zn content).<br>
The present invention can be applied to any Mineral Beneficiation Process Tailings consisting of Sulfide minerals of Zinc (Sphalerite), Lead (Galena), Silver, Iron (Pyrite and Pyrrhotite). It is also believed that the Process claimed in this invention can be applied to Copper, Nickel and other Base Metal Tailings , occurring in their Sulfide forms, with suitable adjustments and modifications. This scheme can also be suitable in treating non-sulphide mineral containing (partially or fully) similar process residues through use of suitable modifiers or alternative flotation reagents.<br>
The present invention is also advantageous in terms of process simplicity and can be implemented in operating plants with out affecting the configuration of existing processes. Due to the simplicity of the Process, as it primarily involves different permutation-combinations of Flotation Techniques , it can be cost beneficial to the Processes that wish to increase Metal recoveries with low investments. The quality of the Bulk Concentrate can be optimized with the Metal recovery values of the Process and Process demands from Metallurgical refineries and hydrometallurgical facilities.<br>
