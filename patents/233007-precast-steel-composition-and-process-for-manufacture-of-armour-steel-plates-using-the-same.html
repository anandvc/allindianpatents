				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pre-cast composition and a process for<br>
manufacture of steel plates in particular, to pre-cast composition and<br>
manufacture of steel plates with yield strength of atleast about 150 kg/mm2,<br>
ultimate tensile strength of atleast about 170 Kg/mm2, and elongation atleast<br>
about 5% with thickness in the range of about 3-6 mm. Importantly, the steel<br>
plates produced by the process are useful as bulletprroof safety appliances and<br>
for patrolling vehicles and are conventionally known as armour steels. Other<br>
applications of armour steel include manufacture of safety bunkers for army<br>
personnel and safety screens for police for protection against rioting mobs.<br>
US 5458704 relates to a process for the production of very hard armour plates<br>
from steel slabs, wherein the slabs are hot rolled to a final thickness above 50<br>
mm and then hardened and possibly tempered.<br>
FR 2619577 A1 relates to steel composition containing silicon-chromium-<br>
molybdenum-vanadium which is specifically directed to application to piercing<br>
cores of armour-piercing projectiles.<br>
DE 3735715 A1 relates to armour plate for strongboxes, safes, burglar-proof wall<br>
claddings and the like and process for producing it. It involves a perforated plate<br>
fastened on a base plate. One or more hard particles are inserted into the<br>
chambers formed by the holes of the perforated plate. Moreover, these chambers<br>
are filled partially or completely with a metal powder. A covering layer consisting<br>
of high-alloy rust-resistant or carbide-containing material is applied over the<br>
perforated plate and its holes by build-up welding. During this build-up welding,<br>
the powder cakes a little in the chambers, but without the hard particles contained<br>
therein being embedded with complete firmness.<br>
DE 3820342 A1 also relates to armour plate for strongboxes, safes, burglar-proof<br>
wall claddings or the like, a perforated sheet is arranged between an outward-<br>
facing cover sheet made of special steel proof against oxyacetylene cutting and a<br>
baseplate. The cavities limited by these three components are filled alternately<br>
with two different layered structures : the first layered structure comprises a first<br>
later adjacent to the cover sheet and consisting of high-alloy, stainless or carbide-<br>
containing material (called the "wearing layer" in brief), a layer located above it<br>
and consisting of hard-metal particles and a second wearing layer which is<br>
welded over the layer of hard-metal particles. The second layered structure II<br>
likewise comprises a first wearing layer which is applied to the cover sheet, but<br>
over which a small ceramic plate then lies. This is covered, in turn, by a second<br>
wearing layer. The armour plate thus constructed successfully withstands even<br>
the attack of highly specialised grinding tools.<br>
DE 4125100 A1 discloses an armour plate obtained of a ductile carrier plate<br>
made of high strength steel and a layer contg. Cr-Ni alloy and hard material. The<br>
plate is relatively thin and light.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most of the above prior art on manufacture of armour steel plates are directed to<br>
manufacture of thick armour plates which some of the other known prior art are<br>
related to production of armour piercing cores and to manufacturing of burglar-<br>
proof strong boxes using cladded steel and ceramic plates. Importantly, most of<br>
the armour plates manufacturing process discussed above include higher<br>
decarburisation during soft annealing before heat treatment and lead to internal<br>
defects, which are responsible for piercing of bullets and fracture in steel plates.<br>
Also, the majority of the armour steel plates are produced in a batch prpcess and<br>
are batch rolled in a piece mill and soft annealed in furnace thus resulting in<br>
decarburisation of surface layers.<br>
Apart from limitations of thickness variation along length and width of such<br>
armour steel plate productions, the conventional processes also result in<br>
precipitation of harmful oxides of alloying elements in the steel.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide for armour steel<br>
which would have the desired high yield strength, tensile strength and also<br>
elongation characteristics at a lower thickness in the range of 3-6 mm thus<br>
providing for thin armour plates.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for simple and cost effective<br>
process for manufacture of thin armour plates which would have the desired<br>
strength and characteristics.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to avoid the problems and<br>
disadvantages associated with the manufacture of armour plates such as higher<br>
decarburisation during soft annealing before heat treatment and internal defects,<br>
which are responsible for piercing of bullets and fracture in steel plates thereby<br>
making the process more cost effective and designed.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a process for<br>
manufacture of thin armour plate in the range of 3-6 mm thickness and would<br>
provide for continuous process for manufacture of armour steel plates not known<br>
in the art.<br>

about 1050 mm wide and up to 6000mm length. This helps in reducing weld<br>
joints during manufacture and achieving proper armour quality and character.<br>
Preferably, the steel plates such as armour steel plates obtained of the above<br>
composition have a thickness of 3-6 mm, length of 2-6 meters and width of 1050<br>
mm.<br>
The steel obtained of the above composition is suitable for use as armour steel<br>
which is also easy to weld if required and free from harmful oxides.<br>

THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The above disclosed steel of the invention is suitable for application as armour<br>
steel include manufacturing of safety bunkers for army personnel and safety<br>
screens for police for protection against rioting mobs. Importantly, the process of<br>
obtaining the armour steel of the invention provides for achieving desired quality<br>
and character of steel with thickness in the range of 3-6 mm.<br>
The prior art on the subject deal mostly with the manufacturing of thicker armour<br>
plates. It may be noted that steel plates of the invention are used in thickness of<br>
3-6 mm, thus putting them in the category of thinner armour plates.<br>
Also, the armour plate manufacturing processes include step of self annealing to<br>
control decarburisation and avoids problems of internal defects, which are<br>
responsible for piercing of bullets and fracture in steel plates. Also, the armour<br>
steel plates of the invention are produced in a continuous process thus avoiding<br>
limitations of batch process.<br>
The steel of the invention effectively uses leaner chemistry for thinner armour<br>
plate production. Higher coiling temperatures are employed during stacking of<br>
coils to take advantage of their "self annealing effect" to minimize decarburisation<br>
in the product and heat treatment of plate to achieve a good impact resistance<br>
against the bullets. No separate soft annealing step is carried out in this process.<br>
The comparative process flow diagrams for process according to the invention<br>
and other known process as illustrated in Fig. 1. The steel plates of the invention<br>
have a new composition and are hot rolled in a continuous mill with better gauge<br>
control. The hot rolled coils are self annealed as against conventional armour<br>
steel plates which are batch rolled in a piece mill and are soft annealed in a<br>
furnace, thus resulting in the decarburisation of surface layers.<br>
In particular, the advantages flowing from the process of the invention are as<br>
follows:<br>
i. Steel can be rolled in 5 stand hot rolling mill under strict control of finishing<br>
and coiling temperatures. Roll crown and profile at different stands and<br>
temperature gradient across the work rolls has been controlled. This has<br>
reduced the variation in thickness along the width and length of the coil.<br>
ii. Coiling temperature is kept sufficiently high to enable pack annealing of<br>
coils to minimize the decarburization on the surface of the plates. Thus,<br>
the effective thickness of the plate does not reduce.<br>
iii. Steel has sufficiently high strength and toughness as compared to other<br>
bullet-proof steels, available in the market. Due to high strength and<br>
toughness, steel plates in 5 mm thickness are adapted to stop bullets of<br>
SLR 7.62 rifle from a distance of 10 meter distance at 90° impact.<br>
iv. Steel plates can be produced in large sizes such as 1050mm wide and up<br>
to 6000 mm in length. This reduces weld joints while using the steel plates<br>
for bullet proofing the patrolling vehicles.<br>
v. Surface of the plates is free from pits, holes and other harmful surface<br>
defects.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder<br>
in greater detail in relation to non- limiting exemplary illustrations as per examples<br>
discussed hereunder:<br>
Example 1:<br>
The armour steel was obtained in accordance with present invention is discussed<br>
hereunder:<br>
The steel composition was selectively used comprising Carbon 0.30, Mn 0.80, Si<br>
0.7, Cr 0.80, Mo 0.25, S 0.01 max. P 0.015 max, Al 0.02 and H22.5 ppm max.<br>
The above steel was subjected to casting followed by hot rolling in a continuous<br>
mill to facilitate desired gauge control. After the rolling step the steel was<br>
subjected to self annealing to control de-carburization to the extent of less than<br>
2%. Finally, after the step of self annealing steel was subjected to heat treatment<br>
involving quenching and tempering.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Under this example, the conventional process of manufacture of armour was<br>
followed. For the purpose, steel composition was provided which was next<br>
subjected to step of casting followed by hot rolling piece mill, furnace annealing<br>
and finally heat treatment to obtain the desired product.<br>
The comparative end properties of the steel manufacture following the process<br>
under Example 1 of the invention and that following conventional process under<br>
Example 2 was next studied and the results are reproduced hereunder in Table I:<br>
As would be evident from the above properties of the steel obtained, the process<br>
of the invention is superior in terms of light weight and at the same time achieving<br>
higher yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and percentage elongation.<br>
The Steel plates of the invention are light weight and can resist the bullets of SLR<br>
7.62 compared to other armour plate. • It is thus possible by way of present<br>
invention to provide armour plates with greater protections inspite of lighter<br>
weight as compared to other similar armour materials.<br>
Further comparative studies are carried out on the steel obtained in accordance<br>
with the invention (Example 1) and the known armour steel plates and the results<br>
are provided in Table II hereunder:<br>
