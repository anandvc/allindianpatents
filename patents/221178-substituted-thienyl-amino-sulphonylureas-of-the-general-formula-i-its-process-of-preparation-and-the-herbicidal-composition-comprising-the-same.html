Substituted thienyl(amino)sulphonylureas<br>
The invention relates to novel substituted thienyl(amino)sulphonylureas, to processes for their preparation and to their use as herbicides.<br>
It is already known that certain substituted thienylsulphonylureas have herbicidal properties (cf. EP-A-30142 / US-A-4481029 / US-A-4599103 / US-A-4701535, EP-A-97122 / US-A-4549898, EP-A-207609 / US-A-4668281). However, the herbicidal activity of these known compounds is not entirely satisfactory.<br>

If appropriate, salts can be prepared from the compounds of the general formula (I)<br>
according to the invention. Such salts are obtained in a simple manner by customary<br>
methods for forming salts, for example by dissolving or dispersing a compound of<br>
the formula (I) in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, methylene chloride,<br>

The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and<br>
20	railway tracks, and on paths and squares with or without tree plantings. Equally, the<br>

25	fields, in lawns, turf and pasture-land, and for the selective control of weeds in annual<br>
crops.<br>

activity and a broad activity spectrum when used on the soil and on above-ground parts<br>
30	of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of<br><br><br>

5	solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents, pastes,<br>
soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>

compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic<br>
15	solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially the following:<br>

25	such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous<br>
earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and<br>
silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated<br>
natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic<br>
granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as<br>
30	sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifying and/or<br>
foam-forming agents are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as<br><br><br>

Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and<br>
synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are<br>
10	mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and<br>
metal phthalocyanine dyes, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron,<br>

0.75 g (2,9 mmol) of 2-phenoxycarbonylamino-4-methoxy-6-methyl-l,3,5-triazine is dissolved in 40 ml of acetonitrile and admixed successively with 0.75 g (3,2 mmol) of methyl 2-methyl-3-sulphamoyl-thiophene-4-carboxylate and 0.49 g (3.2 mmol) of<br>
10	diazabicycloundecene (DBU). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature<br>
(about 20°C) for 12 hours and then concentrated under water-pump vacuum.

5	re-extracted with methylene chloride and the combined organic phases are washed<br>
with water, dried with magnesium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water-pump vacuum and the residue is crystallized from hexane.<br>
This gives 51.7 g (81% of theory) of 4-methoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thiophene-3-<br>
10	sulphonyl chloride.<br>
Step 2<br><br>
15	A   mixture   of  45 g   (177 mmol)   of  4-methoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thiophene-3-<br>
sulphonyl chloride, 34 g (354 mmol) of ammonium carbonate and 400 ml of methylene chloride is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C) for 12 hours. The mixture is filtered and the solvent is distilled off from the filtrate under water-pump vacuum, the residue is digested with diethyl ether and the crystalline product is<br>
20	isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 21.5 g (52% of theory) of 4-methoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thiophene-3-sulphonamide.<br><br><br>

15	Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil. After about 24 hours, the soil is<br>
sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amount of active compound desired is applied per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen so that the particular amount of active compound desired is applied in 1000 litres of water per hectare.<br>
