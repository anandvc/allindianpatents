DRUG CONJUGATE COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]      This invention pertains to a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid, and methods of using same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]      The treatment of cancer has progressed significantly with the development of pharmaceuticals that more efficiently target and kill cancer cells. To this end, researchers have taken advantage of cell-surface receptors and antigens selectively expressed by cancer cells to develop drugs based on antibodies that bind the tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens. In this regard, cytotoxic molecules such as bacteria and plant toxins, radionuclides, and certain chemo&amp;er^eutic drugs have been chemically linked to monoclonal antibodies that bind tumor-specific or tumor-associated cell sur&amp;ce antigens (see. e.g., International (PCT) Patent Application Nos. WO 00/02587, WO 02/060955, and WO 02/092127. U.S. Patents 5,475,092,6,340,701.6,171,586, U.S. Patent AppUcation Publication No. 2003/0004210 Al, and Ghetie et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 112,267-277 (1988)). Such compounds are typically referred to as toxin, radionuclide, and drug "conjugates," respectively. Often they also are referred to as immunoconjugates, radioimmunoconjugates and immimotoxins. Tumor cell killing occurs upon binding of the drug conjugate to a tumor cell and activation of the cytotoxic activity of the maytansinoid. The selectivity afforded by drug conjugates minimizes toxicity to normal cells, thereby enhancing tolerability of the drug in the patient<br>
[0003]      Despite the tumor selectivity afforded by drug conjugates, the use of drug conjugates in a clinical context is limited by a number of factors. In this respect, drug conjugate formulations typically are based on a known formulation of the antibody finm which the drug conjugate is manufactured, without consideration as to what effect the conjugated cytotoxic molecule may have on the stability of the antibody.  As such, current drug conjugate compositions are less stable than compositions containing the tumor-specific antibody alone.<br>
[0004]      Thus, in view of the above, there remains a need for drug conjugate compositions containing highly cytotoxic drugs that are more stable than currently available drug conjugate compositions. There also remains a need for methods of using such drug ; conjugate corr^ositions to treat human diseases associated with cell proliferation, such as icancer.<br><br>
[0005]      The invention provides such a composition and method. These and oihet advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be ^)parent from the description of the invention provided herein.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006]      The Invention provides a composition comprising (i) a therqieutically effective amount of a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid, (ii) a buffering agent, (iii) a tonicifying amount of sodium chloride, (iv) water, and optionally (v) a surfactant, wherein die composition has a pH of about 5-6. The invention also provides a lyophilized composition comprismg (i) a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid, (ii) a buffering agent, (iii) a cryoprotectant, (iv) a bulking agent, and optionally (v) a surfactant, wherein the composition has a pH of about 5-6 when reconstituted with water. The invention fiirther provides a method for killing a cell in a human comprising administering to the human either of the above-described compositions such that the antibody binds to the surface of the cell and the cytotoxicity of the maytansinoid is activated, whereby the cell is killed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION (0007]      The invention provides a composition comprising (i) a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid, (ii) a buffering agent, (iii) optionally a surfactant, (iv) a tonicifying amount of sodium chloride, and (v) water, wherein tfie composition has a pH of about 5-6. [0008]      The inventive composition contains a conjugate which comprises an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid. The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to any immunoglobulin, any immunoglobulin fragment, such as Fab, F(ab')2, dsFv, sFv, diabodies, and triabodies, or immunoglobulin chimera, wliich can bind to an antigen on the sur&amp;ce of a cell (e.g., which contains a complementarity determining region (CDR)). Any suitable antibody can be used in the inventive composition. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the selection of an appropriate antibody will depend upon the cell population to be targeted. In this regard, the type and number of cell surface molecules (i.e., antigens) that are selectively expressed in a particular cell population (typically and preferably a diseased cell population) will govern the selection of an appropriate antibody for use in the inventive composition. Cell surface expression profiles are known for a wide variety of cell types, including tumor cell types, or, if unknown, can be determined using routine molecular biology and histochemistry techniques.<br>
{0009}      The antibody can be polyclonal or monoclonal, but is most preferably a monoclonal antibody. As used herein, "polyclonal" antibodies refer to heterogeneous<br><br>
populations of antibody, typically contained in the sera of immunized animals. "Monoclonal" antibodies refer to homogenous populations of antibody molecules that are specific to a particular antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are typically produced by a single clone of B lymphocytes ("B cells"). Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained using a variety of techniques known to those skilled in die art, including standard hybridoma technology (see, e.g,, Kdhler and Milstein, Eur. J. Immunol, 5,511-519 (1976), Harbw and Lane (eds.), Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press (1988), and C.A. Janeway et al. (eds.), Immunobiology, 5* Ed., Garland Publishing, New York, NY (2001)). In brief; the hybridoma method of producing monoclonal antibodies typically involves injecting any suitable animal, typically and preferably a mouse, with an antigen (i.e., an "immunogen"). The animal is subsequently sacrificed, and B cells isolated tn&gt;m its spleen are fiised with human myeloma cells. A hybrid cell is produced (i.e., a "hybridoma"), which proliferates indefinitely and continuously secretes hi^ titers of an antibody with the desired specificity in vitro. Any appropriate method known in the art can be used to identify hybridoma cells that produce an antibody with the desired specificity. Such methods include, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis, and radioimmunoassay. The population of hybridomas is screened to isolate individual clones, each of which secrete a single antibody species to the antigen. Because each hybridoma is a clone derived from fusion with a single B cell, all the antibody molecules it produces are identical in structure, including their antigen bmding site and isotype. Monoclonal antibodies also maybe generated using other suitable techniques including EBV-hybridoma technology (see, e.g., Haskard and Archer, /. Immunol. Methods, 74(2), 361-67 (1984), and Roder et al.. Methods Enzymol., 121,140-67 (1986)), or bacteriophage vector expression systems (see, e.g., Huse et al.. Science, 246,1275-81 (1989)). To prepare monoclonal antibody fragments, recombinant methods typically are employed. [0010]      The monoclonal antibody can be isolated from or produced in any suitable animal, but is preferably produced in a manunal, more preferably a mouse, and most preferably a human. Methods for producing an antibody in mice are well known to those skilled in the art and are described herem. With respect to human antibodies, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that polyclonal antibodies can be isolated from the sera of human subjects vaccinated or immunized with an appropriate antigen. Alternatively, himian antibodies can be generated by adapting known techniques for producing human antibodies in non-human animals such as mice (see, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,545,806, 5,569,825, and 5,714,352, and U.S. Patrait Application Publication No. 2002/0197266 Al). {0011 ]       While being the ideal choice for then^eutic applications in humans, human antibodies, particularly human monoclonal antibodies, typically are more difficult to generate than moiise monoclonal antibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibodies, however.<br><br>
induce a rapid host antibody response when administered to humans, which can reduce the then^eutic or diagnostic potential of the antibody-drug conjugate. To circumvent these complications, a monoclonal antibody preferably is not recognized as "foreign" by the human immune system. To this end, phage display can be used to generate the antibody. La this regard, phage libraries encoding antigen-binding variable (V) domains of antibodies can be generated usmg standard molecular biology and recombinant DNA techniques (see, e.g., Sambrook et al. (eds.), Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3"* Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (2001)). Phage encoding a variable region with the desired specificity are selected for specific binding to the desired antigen, and a complete human antibody is reconstituted comprising the selected variable domain. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the reconstituted antibody are introduced into a suitable cell line, such as a myeloma cell used for hybridoma production, such that human antibodies having the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies are secreted by the cell (see, e.g., Janeway et al., supra, Huse et al, supra, and U.S. Patmt 6,26S,1S0). Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies can be generated from mice that are transgenic for specific human heavy and Ught chain immunoglobulin genes. Such methods are known in the art and described in, for example U.S. Patents 5,545,806 and 5,569,825, and Janeway et al., supra. Most preferably the antibody is a humanized antibody. As used herein, a "humanized" antibody is one in which the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of a mouse monoclonal antibody, which form the antigen binding loops of the antibody, are grafted onto the framework of a human antibody molecule. Owing to the similarity of the frameworks of mouse and human antibodies, it is generally accepted in the art that this approach produces a monoclonal antibody that is antigenically identical to a human antibody but binds the same antigen as the mouse monoclonal antibody from which the CDR sequences were derived. Methods for generating humanized antibodies are well known in the art and are described in detail in, for example, Janeway et al., supra, U.S. Patents 5,225,539,5,585,089 and 5,693,761, European Patent No. 0239400 Bl, and United Kingdom Patent No. 2188638. Humanized antibodies can also be generated using the antibody resurfacing technology described in U.S. Patent 5,639,641 and Pedersen et al, J. Mol. Biol, 235,959-973 (1994). While the antibody employed in the conjugate of the inventive composition most preferably is a humanized monoclonal antibody, a human monoclonal antibody or a mouse monoclonal antibody, as described above, are also within the scope of the invention. [0012]      Antibody fragments that have at least one antigen binding site, and thus recognize and bind to at least one antigen or receptor present on the surface of a target cell, also are within the scope of the invention. In this respect, proteolytic cleavage of an intact antibody molecule can produce a variety of antibody fragments that retain the ability to recognize and bind antigens. For example, limited digestion of an antibody molecule with<br><br>
the protease papain typically produces three fragments, two of which are identical and are referred to as the Fab fragments, as they retain the antigen binding activity of the parent antibody molecule. Cleavage of an antibody molecule with the enzyme pepsin normally produces two antibody fragments, one of which retains both antigen-binding arms of the antibody molecule, and is thus referred to as the F(ab')2 fragment A single-chain variable region fragment (sFv) antibody fragment, which consists of a truncated Fab frj^^ient comprising the variable (V) domain of an antibody heavy chain linked to a V domain of a Ught antibody chain via a synthetic peptide, can be generated using routine recombinant DNA technology techniques (see, e.g., Jancway et al., supra). Similarly, disulfide-stabilized variable region fragments (dsFv) can be prepared by recombinant DNA technology (see, e.g., Reiter et al.. Protein Engineering, 7,691-704 (1994)). Antibody fragments of the present invention, however, are not limited to these exemplary types of antibody fragments. Any suitable antibody fragment that recognizes and binds to a desired cell surface receptor or antigen can be employed. Antibody-antigen binding can be assayed using any suitable method known in the art, such as, for example, radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, Western blot, inmiunoprecipitation, and conq&gt;etitive inhibition assays (see, e.g., Janeway et al., supra, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0197266 Al). [0013]       In addition, the antibody can be a chimeric antibody.  By "chimeric" is meant that the antibody comprises at least two immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof^-obtained or derived from at least two different species (e.g., two different immunoglobulins, a himian immunoglobulin constant region combined with a murine immunoglobulin variable region). [0014]      Any suitable antibody can be used in the inventive composition. Particularly preferred antibodies are humanized monoclonal antibodies, examples of which mclude huN901, huMy9-6, huB4, huC242, trastuzumab, bivatuzumab, sibrotuzumab, and rituximab (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,639,641, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/424,332, International (PCT) Patent Application No. WO 02/16401, Pedersen et al., J. Mol. Biol, 235,959-973 (1994), Roguska et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91,969-73 (1994), Uu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 8618-8623 (1996), Nadler et al., / Immunol., 131,244-250 (1983), Colomer et al., Cancer Invest., 19,49-56 (2001), Heider et al., Eur. J. Cancer, 31 A, 2385-2391 (1995), Welt et al., J. Qin. Oncol, 12,1193-1203 (1994), Maloney et al.. Blood, 90,2188-2195 (1997), and U.S. Patent 5,665,357). Most preferably, fee antibody is the huN90l humanized monoclonal antibody or the huMy9-6 humanized monoclonal antibody. Other humanized monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and can be used in connection with the inventive composition.<br>
[0015]       In accordance with the invention, the above-described antibody is chemically coupled to any suitable cytotoxic agent, particularly a cytotoxic agent that induces cytotoxicity of tumor cells, to form a conjugate as described above. As a result of normal<br><br>
pharmacologic clearance mechanisms, an antibody employed in a drug conjugate contacts and binds to target cells only in limited amounts. Therefore, the cytotoxic agent employed in the conjugate must be highly cytotoxic such that su£Eicient cell killing occurs to elicit a therspeutic effect Examples of such cytotoxic agents inchide novel taxanes (see, e.g.. International (PCT) Patent Application Nos. WO 01/38318 and PCT/US03/02675), DNA-  . alkylating agents (e.g., CC-106S analogs), anthracyclines, tubulysin analogs, duocarmycin analogs, auristatin E, and cytotoxic agents comprising a reactive polyethylene glycol moiety (see, e.g., Basse et al., J. Antibiot. (Tokyo), 53,879-85 (2000), Suzawa ct al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 8,2175-84 (2000), Ichimura et al., J. Antibiot. (Tokyo), 44,1045-53 (1991), Francisco et al.. Blood (2003) (electronic publication prior to print publication), U.S. Patents 5,475,092,6,340,701,6,372,738, and 6,436,931, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2001/0036923 Al, Pending U.S. Patent Application Nos. 10/024,290 and 10/116,053, and International (PCT) Patent Application No. WO 01/49698). Alternatively and most preferably, the antibody is chemically coupled to a maytansinoid to form the conjugate of the inventive compositioa<br>
[0016]      Maytansinoids were originally isolated from the east Afiican shrub belonging to the genus Mayienus^^fv/eiS SUbsequenilTalso discovered to be metabolites of soil bacteria, such as Actinosynnemapretiosum (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,896,111). Maytansinoids induce cytotoxicity through mitotic inhibition. Experimental evidence suggests that maytansinoids inhibit mitosis by inhibiting polymerization of the microtubule protein tubulin, thereby preventing formation of microtubules (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,441,163 and Remillard et aL, Science, 189,1002-1005 (1975)). Maytansinoids have been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro using cell culture models, and in vivo using laboratory animal systems. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of maytansinoids is 1,000-fold greater than conventional chemothers^eutic agents, such as, for example, meOiotrexate, daunombicin, and vincristine (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,208,020). Maytansinoids are known in the art to include maytansine, maytansinol, C-3 esters of maytansinol, and oOier maytansinol analogues and derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,208,020 and 6,441,163). C-3 esters of maytansinol can be naturally occurring or synthetically derived. Moreover, both naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 maytansinol esters can be classified as a C-3 ester with simple caiboxylic acids, or a C-3 ester with derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine, the latter being more cytotoxic than the former. Synthetic maytansinoid analogues also are known in the art and described in, for example, Kupchan et al., J. Med. Chem., 21,31-37 (1978). Methods for generating maytansinol and analogues and derivatives thereof are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,151,042.<br>
[0017]       Suitable maytansinoids for use in the inventive composition can be isolated from natural sources, synthetically produced, or semi-synthetically produced using methods<br><br>
icnown in the art. Moreover, the maytansinoid can be modified in any suitable manner, so long as sufficient cytotoxicity is preserved in the ultimate conjugate molecule. Tn this regard, maytansinoids lack suitable functional groups to which antibodies can be linked. A linking moiety desirably is utilized to link the maytansinoid to the antibody to form the conjugate. The linking moiety contains a chemical bond that allows for Hae activation of maytansinoid cytotoxicity at a particular site. Suitable chemical bonds are well known in the art and include disulfide bonds, acid labile bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds, thioether bonds formed between sulfhydryl and maleimide groins, and esterase labile bonds. Most preferably, the linking moiety comprises a disulfide bond or a thioetiier bond. In accordance Avith the invention, the linking moiety preferably comprises a reactive chemical group. Particularly preferred reactive chemical groups are N-succinimidyl esters and N-sulfosuccinimidyl esters. In a preferred embodiment, the reactive chemical group can be covalently bound to the maytansinoid via disulfide bonding between thiol groups. Thus, a maytansinoid modified as described herein preferably comprises a thiol group. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a thiol group coiitains a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom and is typically also referred to in the art as a sulfhydryl group, which can be denoted as "-SH" or "RSH."<br>
[0018]      Particularly preferred maytansinoids comprismg a linking moiety that contains a reactive chemical group are C-3 estas of maytansbol and its analogs where the linking moiety contains a disulfide bond and the chemical reactive group comprises a N-succinimidyl or N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester. Many positions on maytansinoids can serve as the position to chemically link the linking moiety. For example, the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, die C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with hydroxy and the C-20 position having a hydroxy groiq&gt; are all usefiiL The linking moiety most preferably is linked to the C-3 position of maytansinol. Most preferably, the maytansinoid used in connection with the inventive composition is N* -deacetyl-N^'-(3-mercapto-l-oxopropyl)-maytansine (DM1) or N'-deacetyl-N'-(4-mercapto-4-methyl-l-oxopentyl)-maytansine(DM4).<br>
[0019]      Linking moieties with other chemical bonds also can be used in the context of the invention, as can other maytansinoids. Specific examples of other chemical bonds include acid labile bonds, thioether bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds and esterase labile bonds. Methods for producing maytansinoids with linking moieties are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 5,208,020,5,416,064, and 6,333,410. [0020]      The linking moiety of a maytansinoid typically and preferably is part of a larger linker molecule that is used to join the antibody to the maytansinoid. Any suitable linker molecule can be used in connection with the invention, so long as the linker molecule provides for retention of the cytotoxicity and targeting characteristics of the maytansinoid<br><br>
and the antibody, respectively. The linker molecule joins the maytansinoid to the antibody through chemical bonds (as described above), such that the maytansinoid and the antibody are chemically coupled (e.g., covalently bonded) to each other. Desirably, the linker molecule chemically couples the maytansinoid to the antibody throu^ disulfide bonds or thioether bonds. Most preferably, the antibody is chemically coupled to the maytansinoid   . via disulfide bonds.<br>
[0021]      Particularly preferred linker molecules include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldifliio)pn&gt;pionate (SPDP) (see, e.g., Carlsson et al., Biochem. J., 173,723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldifliio)butanoate (SPDB) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,563,304), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS Registry number 341498-08-6), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-l-carboxylate (SMCC) (see, e.g., Yoshitake et al., Eur. J. Biochhm., 101,395-399 (1979)), and N-succinimidyl 4-methyI-4-[2-(5-mtro-pyridyl)-dithio]pentanoatc (SMNP) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,563,304)  The most preferred linker molecules for use in the inventive composition are SPP, SMCC, and SPDB.<br>
[0022]      The inventive composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid. A "therapeutically effective amounf' means an amount sufficient to show a meaningful benefit in an individual, e.g., promoting at least one aspect of tiunor cell cytotoxicity, or treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of other relevant medical condition(s) associated with a particular cancer. Therapeutically effective amounts may vary depending upon the biological effect desired in the individual, condition to be treated, and/or the specific characteristics of the conjugate, and the individual. Thus, in accordance with the methods described herein, the attending physician (or other medical professional responsible for administering the composition) will typically decide the amount of the composition with which to treat each individual patient. The concentration of the conjugate in the inventive composition desirably is about 0.1 mg/mL to about 5 mg/mL (c.g., about 0.5 mg/mL, about 2 mg/mL, or about 5 mg/mL). In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the conjugate in the inventive composition is about 1 mg/mL or higher (e.g., about 2 mg/mL or higher, about 3 mg/mL or hi^er, or about 4 mg/mL or higher). Most preferably, the concentration of the conjugate in the inventive composition is about 5 mg/mL While compositions comprising at least 1 mg/mL of the conjugate are particularly preferred, conjugate concentrations of less than 1 mg/mL (e.g., concentrations of about 0.1 mg/mL to about 0.9 mg/mL) also can be stably maintained in the inventive conqxjsition, and thus are within the scope of the invention. Con^sitions comprising greater than 1 mg/mL of the conjugate molecule are advantageous for clinical and commercial use, in that such<br><br>
concentrations enable single doses of the composition to be prepared in a more convenient (i.e., smaller) volume for administration.<br>
[0023]      The inventive composition desirably is fonnulated to be acceptable for pharmaceutical use, such as. for example, administration to a human host in need thereof To this end, the conjugate molecule preferably is formulated into a composition comprising a physiologically acceptable carrier (e.g., cxcipient or diluent). Physiologically acceptable carriers are well known and are readily available, and include buffeting agents, anti¬oxidants, bacteriostats, salts, and solutes that render die formulation isotonic with the blood or other bodily fluid of the human patient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers (e.g., surfactants), and preservatives. The choice of carrier will be.detemiined, at least in part, by the location of the target tissue and/or cells, and the particulair method used to administer the composition. Examples of suitable carriers and excipients for use in drug coigugate formulations are disclosed in, for example, Ihtemational (PCT) Patent .^plication Nos. WO 00/02587, WO 02/060955, and WO 02/092127, and Ghetie et al., J. Immunol Methods, 112,267-277 (1988). Most preferably, the inventive composition comprises a buffering agent, a surfactant, a tonicifying amount of sodium chloride, and water. [0024]      Any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable buffering agent may be used in connection with the inventive composition. Exanqjles of particularly preferred buffering agents include citrate, acetate, succinate, phosphate, and histidine. The inventive composition, however, is not limited to these exemplary buffering agents. The buffering agent may be present in the inventive composition in any suitable concentration, so long as sufScient stability of the composition is achieved imder the desired conditions. In this regard, die concentration of the buffering agent in the composition preferably is about 2 mM to about 50 mM (e.g., about 2-10 mM, about 10-20 mM, about 20-30 noM, about 30-40 mM, or about 40-50 mM). Most preferably, the concentration of the buffering agent in the composition is about 5-15 mM (e.g., about 10 mM). The buffering agent desirably is sodium succinate or sodium acetate, but most preferably is sodium citrate. The buffering agent typically is present in the inventive composition such that the pH is maintained within a desired range. In this respect, the inventive composition preferably has a pH of about 5-6 (e.g., about 5,5.5, or 6). It is believed that compositions with a higher pH (e.g., about pH 6 or higher) are less stable than compositions with a lower pH (i.e., about pH 6 or less). Thus, the inventive composition most preferably has a pH of about 5.5. (0025]      In addition to the buffering agent discussed above, tiie inventive composition also optionally contains a surfiactant Any suitable sur&amp;ctant can be used in connection with the invention. Suitable surfactants are well known to those skilled in the art. In accordance witii the inventive composition, the surfactant desirably is a polysorbate, and preferably is<br><br>
polysoibate20orpolysoibate80. Most preferably, the surfactant is polysorbatc 20. The surfactant may be present in the inventive composition in any suitable concentration, so long as sufficient stability of the composition is achieved under the desired conditions, hi this regard, the concentration of the sur&amp;ctant in the consposition preferably is about 0.002% to about 0.1% wt./vol. (e.g., about 0.002-0.01%, about 0.005-0.02%, or about 0.01-0.1% wtyvol.) of the total volume of the composition. Most preferably, the concentration of the siufactant in the composition is about 0.005-0.02% wtAol. (e.g., about 0.01% wt/vol.) of the total voliune of the composition. Although compositions formulated with sur&amp;ctants are preferred, compositions formulated without surfactants are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0026]      As an additional stabilizing agent, sodium chloride also is added to the inventive composition, hi this regard, the inventive composition comi^rises a suitable amount, preferably a tonicifying amount, of sodiiun chloride (NaCI). i By the phrase a "tonicifying amount of sodium chloride," it is meant that the concentration of NaG in the con^sition is such that the tonicity of the composition is the same as the tonicity of human blood (i.e., isotonic). In this regard, the NaCl can be present in the inventive composition in any suitable concentration, so long as sufficient tonicity and stability is achieved in the inventive composition. Desirably, the concentration of sodium chloride in the composition is about 50 mM to about 500 mM (c.g., about 50-100 mM, about 100-150 mM, about 150-250 mM, about 250-350 mM, or about 350-450 mM). While higher concraitrations of sodium chloride (e.g., about 150 mM or more) may render the inventive conqiosition hypertonic rather than isotonic, dilution of such compositions with any suitable isotonic solvent such as, preferably, dextrose 5% m water ("D5W") or normal saline ("NS") prior to human administration would render such compositions only slightly hypertonic and suitable for use in the invention. Preferably, the concentration of sodium chloride in the conqiosition is about 100 mM to about 200 mM (e.g., about 100-140 mM, about 130-170 mM, or about 160-200 mM). Most preferably, the concentration of sodium chloride m the composition is about 110-150 mM(e.g., about llOmM-lSOmM, or about 120 mM). [0027]      hi a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition comprises (i) about 5 mg/mL of a conjugate conqirising huN901 chemically coupled to DM1, (ii) about 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, (iii) about 0.01% polysoibate 20, (iv) about 120 mM sodium chloride, and (v) water (preferably water suitable for injection (WFI)), wherein the pH of the composition is about 5.S. In another preferred embodiment, die composition comprises (i) about 1 mg/mL or more (e.g., about 1 mg/mL, about 2 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, about 5 mg/mL, or ranges therebetween) of a conjugate comprising huMy9-6 chemically coupled to DM1, (ii) about 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, (iii) optionally about 0.01% polysoibate 20, (iv) about 135 mM sodium chloride, and (v) water, wherein tiie pH<br><br>
of the composition is about S.5. In yet another preferred embodiment, the composition comprises (i) about 1 mg/mLor more (e.g., about I mg/mL, about 2 mg^nL, 3 mg/mL, about S mg/mL, or ranges therebetween) of a conjugate comprising huMy9-6 chemically coupled to DM4, (ii) about 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, (ill) optionally about 0.01% polysoibate 20, (iv) about 135 mM sodium chloride, and (v) water, wherein the pH of the composition is about 5.5. In an additional preferred embodiment, the composition comprises (i) about 1 mg/mL or more (e.g., about 1 mg/mL, about 2 mg/mL, 3 mg^nL, about 5 mg/mL, or ranges therebetween) of a conjugate comprising huN901 cheanically coupled to DM1 via an SMCC linker, (ii) about 10 mM sodium citrate buffo:, (iii) optionally about 0.01% polysorbate 20, (iv) about 130 mM sodium chloride, and (v) water, wherein the pH of the composition is about 5.5.<br>
[0028]      Compositions containing antibodies (or proteins in general) are rendered unstable by oxidation. Thus, in another embodiment of the invention, the composition further comprises an antioxidant. Any suitable antioxidant can be used in the inventive composition. Suitable antioxidants are known in the art and include, for example, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, tocotrienols, polyphenols, zinc, manganese, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin £, beta carotene, cysteine, and methionine. The antioxidant used in connection wi&amp; the inventive composition most preferably is methionine. The antioxidant can be present in the composition in any suitable concentration. Desirably, &amp;e concentration of the antioxidant in the composition is about 100 pM to about 100 mM (e.g., about 0.25-1 mM, about 0.5-2 mM, about 5-15 mM, about 20-70 mM, or about 60-90 mM). Most preferably, the concentration of the antioxidant in the composition is about 5-15 mM (e.g., about 10 mM).<br>
[0029]      In addition to antioxidants, the inventive composition can fiuther be stabilized by the addition of sucrose. The use of sucrose to stabilize antibody formulations is known to those of skill in the art Any suitable amount of sucrose can be used in the inventive composition, but the concentration of sucrose in the composition desirably is about 0.1% to about 10% wt./vol. (e.g., about 0.1-1%, about 2-5%, or about 7-10% wt/vol.) of the total voliune of the composition. Most preferably, the concentration of sucrose in the composition is about 4-6% wt./vol. (e.g., about 5% wt./vol.) of the total volume of the composition.<br>
[0030]      The invention fiuther provides a packaged composition comprising a sealed container having the inventive composition dispersed therein, and an inert gas overlay. The packaged composition can be overlaid with any suitable inert gas, so long as the inventive composition is stably maintained within the packaged composition. The inert gas preferably is nitrogen or argon. The packaged composition can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules or vials.<br><br>
100311      In addition to the water-containing composition described herein (also referred to herein as a "liquid" or "aqueous" composition), the invention also provides alyophilized composition comprismg (i) a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate conqnising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinold, (ii) a buffering agent, (iii) a sur&amp;ctant, (iv) a cryoprotectant, and (v) a bulking agent, wherein the composition has a pH of about 5-6 when reconstituted with water. By "lyophilized" is meant that the composition has been freeze-dried under a vacuum. Lyophilization typically is accomplished by freezing a particular foimuladon such that the solutes are separated from the solvent(s). The solvent is then removed by sublimation (i.e., primary drying) and next by desorption (i.e., secondary drying). Descriptions of the conjugate (i.e., the antibody chemically coupled to the maytansinold), buffering agent, surfactant, and components thereof, set forth above in connection with other embodiments of the invention also are applicable to those same aspects of the aforesaid lyophilized composition.1 Prior to reconstitution of the lyophilized composition, the relative amounts of each component comprising the inventive lyophilized composition can be described in terms of mg of excipient (e.g., buffer, surfactant, bulking agent, cryoprotectant) per mg of conjugate.<br>
[0032]      While any suitable buffering agent described herein can be used in connection with the inventive lyophilized composition, the inventive lyophilized composition preferably comprises a sodium succinate buffer. The buffering agent can be present in the inventive lyophilized composition in any suitable amount  In particular, the lyophilized composition desirably comprises about 0.1 mg to about 2 mg of the bufifering agent per mg of the conjugate (e.g., about 0.1 mg to about 0.5 mg bufifering agent per mg of the conjugate, about O.S mg to about 1 mg buffering agent per mg of the conjugate, or about 1 mg about 2 mg buffering agent per mg of the conjugate). Most preferably, the lyophilized composition comprises about 0.3 mg sodium succinate buffer per mg of the conjugate. (0033]      While any suitable surfactant described herein can be used in connection with the inventive lyophilized composition, the surfactant desirably is apolysoibate, and preferably is polysoibate 20 or polysorbate 80. Most preferably, the surfactant is polysorbate 20. The surfactant may be present in the inventive lyophilized conqiosition in any suitable amount, so long as sufGcient stability of the lyophilized composition is achieved under the desired conditions. In this regard, the lyophilized composition desirably comprises about O.OOS mg to about 0.1 mg of the surfactant per mg of the conjugate (e.g., about 0.005 mg to about 0.01 mg surfactant per mg of the conjugate, about 0.01 mg to about O.OS mg surfactant per mg of the conjugate, or about 0.05 mg to about 0.1 mg surfactant per mg of the conjugate). When the surfactant is polysorbate 20, the lyophilized composition preferably comprises about 0.02 mg polysorbate 20 permg of the conjugate.<br><br>
(0034 J      In order to prevent degradation of the active ingredients of the composition during fieezing and drying, the inventive lyophilized composition fiirflier comprises a cryoprotectant, preferably an amoiphous cryoprotectant. The term "cryoprotectant," as used herein, refers to an excipient that protects imstable molecules during freezing. Suitable cryoprotectants for use in the inventive composition are known to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, glucose, trehalose, and sucrose. Most preferably, the cryoprotectant is sucrose. The cryoprotectant may be present in the inventive lyophilized composition in any suitable amount. The lyophilized composition desirably comprises about 0.5 mg to about 5 mg (e.g., about 0,5 mg to about 2 mg) of the cryoprotectant per mg of tiie conjugate (e.g., about 0.8 mg cryoprotectant per mg of the conjugate, about 2 mg cryoprotectant per mg of the conjugate, or about 4 mg cryoprotectant per mg bf the conjugate). When the ciyoprotectant is sucrose, the lyophilized composition preferably con^rises about O.S mg to about 2 mg (e.g., about 1 mg) sucrose per mg of the conjugate.<br>
[0035]      The inventive lyophilized composition can fiuther contain a bulking agent, preferably a crystallizable bulking agent Bulking agents typically are used in the art to provide structure and weight to the "cake" produced as a result of lyophilization. Any suitable buUdng agent known in the art may be used in connection with the inventive lyophilized con^sition. Suitable bulking agents include, for example, mannitol, dextran, and glycine. The bulking agent used in the inventive composition most preferably is glycine. The lyophilized composition can contain any suitable amoimt of the bulking agent, but preferably the lyophilized composition conq)rises about 2 mg to about 20 mg of the bulking agent per mg of the conjugate (e.g., about 2 mg to about 10 mg bulking agent per mg of the conjugate, about 5 mg to about 10 mg bulking agent per mg of the conjugate, about 10 mg to about 15 mg bulking agent per mg of the conjugate, or about 15 mg to about 20 mg bulking agent per mg of the conjugate). When the bulking agent is glycine, the lyophilized composition preferably comprises about 3.8 mg glycine per mg of the conjugate.<br>
[0036]      Thus, in accordance &gt;vith the invention, the contents of a lyophilized composition that is to be reconstituted to contain 5 mg/mL of conjugate (e.g., preferably a conjugate comprising huN901 chemically coupled to DM1) preferably compiises (i) about 0.3 mg sodium succinate buffer per mg of the conjugate, (ii) about 0.02 mg polysoibate 20 per mg of the conjugate, (iii) about 1 mg sucrose per mg of the conjugate, and (iv) about 3.8 mg glycine per mg of the conjugate. Once reconstituted with water, such a lyophilized composition preferably has a pH of about 5.5. Moreover, when tiie lyophilized composition is reconstituted with water, the descriptions of the relative concentrations of the conjugate.<br><br>
the buffering agent, and the sur&amp;ctant set forth above in comiection with the inventive liquid composition also are qjpUcable to the aforesaid lyophilized composition. [0037]      Lyophilization methods are well known in the art and are described in, for example, Wang, W., Int. J. Pham., 203,1-60 (2000). For exan^le, the inventive lyophilized con^rasition can be produced using a lyophilization cycle comprising the following stqjs: (1) pre-cooling at a shelf temperature of 4 "C and ambient chamber pressure for 2.5 hours, (2) freezing at a shelf temperature of -50 "C and ambient chamber pressure for 14 hours, (3) glycine recrystallization at a shelf tea^erature of-20 "C and ambient chamber pressure for 6 hours, (4) re-freezing at a shelf temperature of-50 °C and ambient chamber pressure for 16 hours, (5) primary drying at a shelf temperature of -13 "C and 100 mTorr of pressure for 24 hours, (6) secondary drying at a shelf temperature of 24 °C and 100 mToir of pressure for 10 hours, and (7) stopper phase at a shelf temperature of 24 "C and ambient chamber pressure. The inventive lyophilized composition, however, is not limited to compositions produced by the above-described method. Indeed, any suitable lyophilization method can be used to produce the inventive lyophilized composition, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the chosen lyophilization parameters (e.g., drying times) will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of the solution to be lyophilized.<br>
[0038]      In addition to the preferred embodiments described herein, the inventive composition (whether in Uquid or lyophilized form) can comprise additional thraapeutic or biologically active agents. For example, therapeutic factors useful in the freatment of a particular indication (e.g., cancer) can be present Factors that control inflammation, such as ibuprofen or steroids, can be part of the composition to reduce swelling and inflammation associated with in vivo administration of the composition and physiological distress. Immune enhancers can be included in the conq&gt;osition to up regulate the body's natural defenses against disease. Vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, and micronutrients can be co-administered with the composition. Antibiotics, i.e., microbicides and fungicides, can be present to reduce the risk of infection pertaining to the procedures associated with administration of the composition and other disorders.<br>
[0039]      The invention further provides a method for killing a cell in a human comprising administering to the human a composition comprismg (i) a then^eutically effective amount of a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coi:pled to a maytansinoid, (ii) a buffering agent, (iii) a surfactant, (iv) atonicifying amount of sodium chloride, and (v) water, wherein the con^osition has a pH of about S-6, such that the antibody binds to Hit surface of the cell and the cytotoxicity of the maytansinoid is activated, whereby the cell is killed. Descriptions of the conjugate (i.e., the antibody chemically coupled to the maytansinoid), excipients (e.g., buffering agent, surfactant, sodium chloride, etc.), and<br><br>
components thereof^ set forth above in connection with other embodiments of the invention also are q&gt;plicable to those same aspects of the aforesaid inventive method. [0040]      The inventive method involves administeiing the inventive composition to a human. Ideally, the inventive method is used to target and kill cells affected by a disease, particularly a disease associated with elevated levels.of cellular proliferation, such as cancer. Thus, m this regard, the inventive method preferably is used to kill tumor cells in a human, thereby resulting in the prevention, amelionition, and/or cure of the cancer. [0041 ]      While any suitable means of administering the composition to a human can be used within the context of the invention, typically and preferably the inventive conqwsition is administered to a human via injection, and most preferably via infusion. By the term "injection," it is meant that the composition is forcefully introduced into a target tissue of the human. By the tenn "infusion," it is meant! that the composition is introduced mto a tissue, typically and preferably a vein, of the human. The composition can be administned to the hiunan by any suitable route, but preferably is administered to die human intravenously or intraperitoneally. When the inventive method is employed to kill tumor cells, however, intratumoral administration of the inventive composition is particularly preferred. When the inventive composition is administered by injecting, any suitable injection device can be used to administer the composition directly to a tumor. For example, the common medical syringe can be used to directly inject tiie conqx&gt;sition into a subcutaneous tumor. Alternatively, the composition can be topically applied to the tumor by bathing the tumor in the inventive liquid composition. Likewise, the tumor can be perfused with the inventive con^sition over a period of time using any suitable delivery device, e.g., a catheter. While less preferred, other routes of administration can be used to deliver the composition to the human. Indeed, although more than one route can be used to administer the inventive composition, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. For example, while not particularly preferred, the inventive composition can be ^plied or instilled into body cavities, absoibed dirou^ the skin, inhaled, or administered parenterally via, for instance, intramuscular or intraarterial administration. Preferably, the inventive composition parenterally administered to a human is specifically targeted to particular cells, e.g., cancer cells.<br>
[0042]      As described herein, the conjugate comprises an antibody, which is preferably a humanized monoclonal antibody, such as huN901, huMy9-6, huB4, or buC242. Other suitable antibodies include, for example, trastuzumab, bivatuzumab, sibrotuzumab, and lituximab. When compositions comprising such conjugates are employed in the inventive method, the antibody targets the conjugate to a desired cell (e.g., a tumor cell) through interactions with antigens (e.g., tumor-specific antigens) expressed at the surface of the cell (e.g., tumor cell). Tumor-specific antigens have been extensively described in the prior art<br><br>
for a variety of tumors, including, for example, epithelial cancers (e.g., MUCl), and breast and ovarian cancer (c.g., HER2/neu), (see, e.g., Bartnes, Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen., 121, 2941-5 (2001), and von Mensdorff-Pouilly et al.. Int. J. Biol. Markers, 15,343-356 (2000)), [0043]      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody (e.g., huMy9-6) binds to the CD33 antigen, which is expressed, for example, by acute myeloid leukemia cells. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody (e.g., huB4) binds to the CD19 antigen, which is expressed, for example, by human B-cell lymphoma cells. Alternatively, the antibody (e.g., huC242) binds to the CanAg antigen, which is expressed by a number of cancer cell types, including, for example, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and other gastrointestinal cancers, and the majority of non-small-cell lung cancers. Most preferably, die antibody (e.g., huN901) binds to the NCAM/CD56 antigen, which is expressed, for example, by small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells, and b!y other cancers of neuroendocrine origin. Other preferred antigens to which the antibody can bind include the GD3 antigen, PSMA, the alpha-folate receptor, Her2/neu, CD44v6, the fetoacinar pancreatic (FAP) antigen, the Cripto-1 antigen, the CA6 antigen, CD20, CA 55.1, MN/CA K, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (see, e.g., Chang et al.. Cancer Res., 59,3192-98 (1999), Miotti et al.. Int. J. Cancer, 39, 297-303, (1987), Colomer et al., stq}ra, Heider et al., supra. Welt et al., supra, LePage et al., American Assn. For Cancer Research (AACR), 2003 Anuual Meeting Poster Abstact No. 749, Kearse et al., Int. J. Cancer, 88, 866-72 (2000), Maloney et al., supra. Opavsky ct al.. Genomics, 33,480-87 (1996), Behm et al.. Blood, 87,1134-39 (1996), and U.S. Patent 5,665,357). Upon binding of the conjugate to a target (i.e., tumor) cell via any of the tumor specific antigens or receptors described herein, the cytotoxicity of the maytansinoid is activated. Examples of mechanisms by which maytansinoid cytotoxicity can be activated include release of the free maytansinoid inside the cell via cleavage of the disulfide linkage between the antibody and the maytansinoid, antibody degradation within die cell, and activation of maytansinoid cytotoxicity at the cell surface. The invoitive method, however, is not limited to these exemplary modes of maytansinoid activatioa Indeed, any mechanism that activates the cytotoxicity of the maytansinoid is within &amp;e scope of the inventive method.<br>
[0044]      For the purposes of human administration, the inventive liquid composition described herein may be administered (e.g., infiised) directly to a human, or dUuted with a suitable diluent immediately prior to administration. Suitable diluents are known in the art and include D5W and normal saline (NS). Dilutions of 1:1,1:2,1:3, or more (e.g., 1:5, 1:10, or even 1:50) with suitable diluents are possible. Dilution of the inventive composition desirably does not reduce the concentration of the conjugate molecule in the composition below about 0.1 mg/mL. Upon diluting the inventive liquid composition, the<br><br>
previously described concentrations of each of the components (e.g., buffering agent, surfactant, and sodiimi chloride) of the composition are correspondingly reduced. [0045]      When the inventive lyophilized con^sition described herein is administoed to a human, the composition must be first reconstituted by adding a sterile liquid excipient, for example, water suitable for injection, D5W, or NS, immediately prior to use. Thus, the invention further provides a method for killing a cell in a human comprising (a) providing the lyophilized composition as described herein, (b) adding water to the lyophilized composition to provide a reconstituted composition, and (c) administering the reconstituted composition to the human such that the antibody binds to the surfiice of the cell and the maytansinoid is internalized by the cell, whereby the cell is killed. Descriptions of the lyophilized composition, administration routes, tumor specific antigens, and components thereof; set forth above in coimection with othdr embodiments of the invention also are ^plicable to those same aspects of the aforesaid inventive method. Moreover, as discussed herein, after the inventive lyophilized composition is reconstituted with water, the descriptions of the relative concentrations of the conjugate and excipients (e.g.. buffering agent, surfactant, cryoprotectant, and bulking agent) described above in coimection with the inventive liquid composition also are applicable to those same aspects of the aforesaid inventive method.<br>
[0046]      As discussed herein, the inventive method, whether employing a liquid composition or a lyophilized composition, preferably is used in connection with treating cancer. The inventive method can be used to treat cancer of any type, including, for example, cancer of the lung, breast, colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, ovary, blood, and lymphatic organs. While less preferred, the inventive composition may be used to treat other diseases associated with cellular proliferation includmg autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis), graft rejections (e.g., renal transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, lung transplant rejection, cardiac transplant rejection, and bone mairow transplant rejection), graft versus host disease, viral infections (e.g., CMV infection, HTV infection, AIDS, etc,), and parasitic infections (e.g., giardiasis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis), and others.<br>
[0047]      The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 [0048]      This example demonstrates the production of a composition comprising a conjugate comprising an antibody chemically coupled to a maytansinoid, buffering agent, surfactant, tonicifying amount of sodium chloride, and water.<br><br>
[0049]      The generation of a conjugate comprising the huN901 monoclonal antibody chemically coiq)led to the maytansinoid DM1 via disulfide bonds ("huN901:DMr') has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,441,163). Foimulations containing eidier 1 mg/mLor5mg/mLofthehuN901:DMl conjugate in the presence of each of the above-described excipients individually were prepared. The stability of each of the formulations was assessed using the following assays: visual inspection to detect particulates, a chromatographic method to measure fi:ee diug-related species, and HPLC size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) to detect high and low molecular weight conjugate-related species. With respect to visual inspection, the presence of particulates are indicative of instability and, therefore, are considered undesirable, while a clear solution is indicative of a stable formulation. The chromatogr^hic ass,ay was used to measure the amount of fi«e drug at 4 "C and 25 "C. The results of each df these assays suggested that a formulation containing about S mg/mL buN901;DMl conjugate, about 10 mM sodium citrate, about 0.01% polysoifoate and sodium chloride at pH 5.5 (i.e., the inventive liquid composition) would have superior stability.<br>
[OOSO]       To confirm the stability of the above-described formulation with respect to dimer formation, which also is an indicator of instability, the huN90l:DMl conjugate was concentrated and formulated in either phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.5 (Formulations lA-lC), or 10 mM sodium citrate, O.OI % polysoibate 20, 60 mM NaCl, pH 5.5 (Formulation ID). After 6 months at 4 "C or 25 °C the samples were assayed by SEC-HPLC. The results of this analysis are set forth in Table 1.<br><br>
