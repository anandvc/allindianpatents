Optical Isomers - Diastereomers - Geometric Isomers - Tautomers<br>
Compounds of Formula I contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as<br>
racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual<br>
diastereomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds<br>
of Formula I.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless<br>
specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein may exist with different points of attachment<br>
of hydrogen, referred to as tautomers. Such an example may be a ketone and its enol form known as<br>
keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixture thereof are encompassed with<br>
compounds of Formula I.<br>
Compounds of the Formula I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of<br>
enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example MeOH or<br>
EtOAc or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual<br>
stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active amine as a resolving<br>
agent or on a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of the general Formula I or la may be<br>
obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known<br>
configuration.<br>

acids.<br>
It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I are<br>
meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Utilities<br>
The ability of the compounds of Formula I to antagonize the actions of VLA-4 integrin<br>
makes them useful for preventing or reversing the symptoms, disorders or diseases induced by the<br>
binding of VLA-4 to its various ligands. Thus, these antagonists will inhibit cell adhesion processes<br>
including cell activation, migration, proliferation and differentiation. Accordingly, another aspect of the<br>
present invention provides a method for the treatment (including prevention, alleviation, amelioration or<br>
suppression) of diseases or disorders or symptoms mediated by VLA-4 binding and cell adhesion and<br>
activation, which comprises administering to a mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.<br>
Such diseases, disorders, conditions or symptoms are, for example (1) multiple sclerosis, (2) asthma, (3)<br>
allergic rhinitis, (4) allergic conjunctivitis, (5) inflammatory lung diseases, (6) rheumatoid arthritis, (7)<br>
septic arthritis, (8) type I diabetes, (9) organ transplantation rejection, (10) restenosis, (11) autologous<br>
bone marrow transplantation, (12) inflammatory sequelae of viral infections, (13) myocarditis, (14)<br>
inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, (15) certain types of toxic<br>
and immune-based nephritis, (16) contact dermal hypersensitivity, (17) psoriasis, (18) tumor metastasis,<br>
 (19) atherosclerosis, (20) sickle cell anemia, (21) certain acute leukemias, (22) various melanomas,<br>
carcinomas and sarcomas (including multiple myeloma); (23) acute respiratory distress syndrome; (24)<br>
uveitis; (25) circulatory shock; and (26) hepatitis.<br>

Dose Ranges<br>
The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of<br>
course, vary with the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, and with the particular compound<br>
of Formula I used and its route of administration. The dose will also vary according to the age, weight<br>
and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range lie within the range of from about<br>
0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 50 mg per kg,<br>
and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be<br>
necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.<br>
For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable<br>
dosage range is from about 0.01 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.1 mg to about 10 mg) of a<br>
compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day.<br>
In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range is, e.g. from<br>
about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day, preferably<br>
from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg per kg.<br>
For use where a composition for sublingual administration is employed, a suitable<br>
dosage range is from 0.01 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.1 mg to about 5 mg) of a compound of<br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
comprises a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "composition",<br>
as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active<br>
ingredients), and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the<br>
carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or<br>
aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients,<br>
or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a<br>
compound of Formula I, additional active ingredients), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal,<br>
especially a human with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral,<br>
sublingual, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage<br>
forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols,<br>
and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of<br>
Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic<br>
bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, sublingual, rectal, topical,<br>
parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary<br>
(aerosol inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will<br>
depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active<br>
ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods<br>
well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or nebulizers.<br>
The compounds may also be delivered as powders which may be formulated and the powder composition<br>
may be inhaled with the aid of an insufflation powder inhaler device. The preferred delivery systems for<br>
inhalation are metered dose inhalation (MDI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a suspension or<br>
solution of a compound of Formula I in suitable propellants, such as fluorocarbons or hydrocarbons and<br>
dry powder inhalation (DPI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a dry powder of a compound of<br>
Formula I with or without additional excipients<br>
Suitable topical formulations of a compound of formula I include transdermal devices,<br>
aerosols, creams, ointments, lotions, dusting powders, and the like.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in<br>
intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding<br>
techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired<br>
for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral<br>
dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water,<br>
glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral<br>
liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches,<br>
sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets,<br>
with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of<br>
administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case<br>
solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard<br>
aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of Formula I may<br>
also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 3,630,200 and 4,008,719.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration<br>
may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined<br>
amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous<br>
liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such<br>
compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of<br>
bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary<br>
ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active<br>
ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the<br>
product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding,<br>
optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing<br>
in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally<br>
mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be<br>
made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert<br>
liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient<br>
and each cachet or capsule contains from about 1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient.<br>
The following are examples of representative pharmaceutical dosage forms for the<br>

The weight ratio of the compound of the Formula I to the second active ingredient may<br>
be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of<br>
each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the Formula I is combined with an NSACD<br>
the weight ratio of the compound of the Formula I to the NSAED will generally range from about 1000:1<br>
to about 1:1000, preferably about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the Formula I<br>
and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an<br>
effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.<br>

Compounds of the present invention may be prepared by procedures illustrated in the<br>
accompanying schemes. In Scheme 1, a substituted pyridyl-4-carboxylic acid derivative A is treated with<br>
thionyl chloride to make the carboxylic acid chloride derivative which is then reacted with a 4-amino-<br>
(L)-phenylalanine derivative to yield the amide B. The N-BOC-protecting group in B is removed with<br>
strong acid (TFA or HC1) to afford the free amine C.<br>
In Scheme 2, an appropriately substituted (Lproline ester D (R'=H) is sulfonylated with 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl<br>
chloride L in the presence of base (DJPEA or Na2CO3) to yield sulfonamide E which, if<br>
containing an ester protecting group, is treated with hydroxide to afford the free acid. Amine C and acid<br>
E are reacted together in the presence of an appropriate coupling agent (eg., PyBOP, HBTU/HOAt, or E<br>
may be first converted to the corresponding acid chloride) to afford amide F. Alternatively, the proline<br>
ester D (R'=BOC) is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid by treatment with a base such as LiOH. The<br>
acid is then coupled with C, as described above, to give M, following the removal of the BOC group.<br>
The amine M is then sulfonylated with L in the presence of a base to provide F. The ester in F can be<br>

Step 1: Synthesis of A^-[(3-Cyanobenzene)sulfonvl]-3-[3.3-difluoropyrrolidine1 methyl ester<br>
To a solution of (3S)-hydroxy-(L)-proline (Acros, 20 g, 0.15 mol) and sodium carbonate<br>
(26 g, 0.25 mol) in 500 mL of water at 0°C was added powdered 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride (25 g,<br>
0.12 mol). After stirring at rt overnight, the reaction mixture was acidified with concentrated HC1<br>
(pH=3), and the product was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The organic extracts were dried<br>
(MgSO4), filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was then dissolved in methylene chloride<br>
(100 mL) and MeOH (100 mL), and was added trimethylsilyldiazomethane (2 Mia. ether) at QOC until a<br>
yellow color persisted. After stirring at rt for 15 min, the mixture was concentrated to dryness to give N-<br>
[(3-cyanobenzene)sulfonyl]-3(»S)-hydroxy-(L)-proline, methyl ester (31.5 g).<br>
To the above compound (31.5 g, 0.10 mol) in 200 mL of EtOAc at 0°C was added TEA<br>
(20 mL, 0.14 mol) and MsCl (9.5 mL, 0.12 mol). After stirring at 0°C for 20 min, the reaction was<br>
quenched with 100 mL of aqueous sodium bicarbonate. After stirring for 15 min, the reaction mixture<br>
was partitioned between EtOAc (300mL) and aqueous sodium bicarbonate (200 mL). The organic layer<br>
was separated, washed with brine and concentrated to dryness to give N-[(3-cyanobenzene)sulfonyl]-<br>
3(S)-methanesulfonyloxy-(L)-proline, methyl ester (40 g).<br>
To a solution of the above compound (39.5 g, 0.10 mol) in 300 mL of AcCN was added<br>
TEA (35 mL, 0.25 mol). After heating at 75 °C for 4 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to rt and<br>
concentrated. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc (600mL) and washed with 1 N aqueous NaOH and<br>
brine, and concentrated to dryness to give N-[(3-cyanobenzene)sulfonyl]-2,3-dehydroproline, methyl<br>
ester (28 g).<br>
To a suspension of ,/V-[(3-cyanobenzene)sulfonyl]-2,3-dehydroproline methyl ester (0.7<br>
g, 2.4 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF was added 3,3-difluoropyrrolidine hydrochloride salt ( 2 g, 14.0 mmol)<br>
and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (2.4 mL, 14.0 mmol). After heating at 50 °C for 24 h, the<br>
