CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Application No. 11/030,934, filed January 7, 2005, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to tracking movement of an object placed within a living body, and specifically to object tracking using impedance measurements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many medical procedures involve introducing an object into a patient's body and sensing the object's movement. To support these procedures, various position sensing systems have been developed or envisioned in the prior art.<br>
For example, U.S. Patents 5,697,377 and 5,983,126 to Wittkampf, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, describe a system in which three substantially orthogonal alternating signals are applied through the patient. A catheter is equipped with a measuring electrode, which for cardiac procedures is positioned at various locations either against the patient's heart wall or within a coronary vein or artery. A voltage is sensed between the catheter tip and a reference electrode, preferably a surface electrode on the patient. Three processing channels are. used to separate out the three components as x, y and z signals, from which calculations<br>
BI05082USNP	1<br><br>
are made for determination of the three-dimensional location of the catheter tip within the body.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,944,022 to Nardella, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a similar system for detecting the position of a catheter. The system includes three sets of excitation electrodes, with one set disposed in each of three intersecting axes. A signal processor measures a voltage indicative of impedance between a detection electrode disposed on the catheter and each of the three sets of excitation signals in order to determine the X coordinate, Y coordinate and Z coordinate of the catheter.<br>
Additional methods for detecting impedance along axes between excitation electrodes are disclosed by U.S. Patent 5,899,860 to Pfeiffer; U.S. Patent 6,095,150 to Panescu; U.S. Patent 6,456,864 to Swanson; and U.S. Patents 6,050,267 to Nardella, all of whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Impedance measurements are also used in assessing contact between an electrode and tissue inside the body. For example, methods for determining contact between a catheter electrode and internal tissue, based on the impedance between the catheter electrode and a return electrode, are described in U.S. Patent 5,935,079 to Swanson, et al., U.S. Patent 5,836,990 to Li, U.S. Patent. 5,447,529 to Marchlinski, et al., and U.S. Patent 6,569,160 to Goldin, et al., all of whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Patent 5,341,807 to Nardella, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a system for detecting when an ablation electrode contacts endocardium tissue, utilizing separate circuits for position monitoring and for tissue<br>
BI05082USNP	2<br><br>
contact monitoring. When the ablation electrode touches internal tissue, the impedance from the body-surface to the electrode increases because less of the electrode is in contact with the electrolytic fluid (i.e., blood) that generally surrounds the probe.<br>
BI05082USNP	3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide efficient apparatus and methods for calibrating and for stabilizing impedance-based systems used for tracking an intrabody object.<br>
The above-mentioned U.S. Patent Application 11/030,934 describes a position tracking system in which impedance measurements between an intrabody probe and the surface of a patient' s body are used to track the probe position. These measurements involve passing a current between an electrode fixed to the probe and several electrodes on the body-surface. Such measurements are sensitive to variations in the electrical contact of the body-surface electrodes, as well as to variations in the extent of contact between the probe electrode and internal tissue.<br>
Body-surface electrode contact may fluctuate due to factors such as sweat and partial electrode lifting. Movement of the probe may bring the probe electrode into contact with internal tissue, thereby causing sudden changes in the impedance measured from the body-surface to the probe electrode. Both factors of surface electrode contact and internal tissue contact may affect the stability of position measurements.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the quality of the body-surface electrode contact is calibrated periodically to correct for contact fluctuations. In the disclosed embodiments, calibration is performed by measuring the current between, pairs of body-surface electrodes. These currents are indicative of the total impedance of the current path through the body between the electrodes, including the electrode contact<br>
BI05082USNP	4<br><br>
impedance. Techniques described hereinbelow are used to extract from the multiple current measurements a calibration factor for body-surface electrode contact of each electrode. The process is typically repeated at regular intervals in order to maintain accurate calibration.<br>
Further embodiments of the present invention provide means and methods for correcting impedance variations due to internal tissue contact. To achieve this correction, the probe electrode is tracked by a relative, rather than absolute, measure of impedance. Relative impedance is measured by comparing the impedance from the probe electrode to one body-surface electrode with the sum of several impedances measured between the probe electrode and several respective body-surface electrodes. When the impedances measured to the several body-surface electrodes change by the same relative amount, the change is attributed to internal tissue contact and the change is factored out of the location calculation.<br>
There is therefore provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method for calibrating impedance, including;<br>

Typically, calculating the relation includes determining a value of relative impedance between the probe' electrode and each of the body-surface electrodes.

In disclosed embodiments, calculating the relation includes determining at least two values of relative impedance between the probe electrode and the first and second body-surface electrodes and solving a set of linear equations whose parameters include the at least two values. In further embodiments, tracking the movement of the probe includes determining that a change in the first and second currents that does not significantly change the relation between the first and second currents is indicative of contact of the probe electrode with tissues of varying impedance within the body, and not due to the movement of the probe.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a position tracking system 20, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As described in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent Application 11/030,934, impedance-based position tracking in system 20 is performed by inserting a probe, such as a catheter 22, into an internal body cavity, such as a chamber of a heart 24 of a subject 26. Typically, the catheter is used for diagnostic or therapeutic treatment performed by medical practitioner 28, such as mapping electrical potentials in the heart or performing ablation of heart tissue. The catheter or other intrabody device may alternatively be used for other purposes, by itself or in conjunction with other treatment devices.<br>
The distal tip of catheter 22 comprises at least one electrode 48. Electrode 48 may be of any suitable shape and size, and may be used for other purposes, as well, such as for electrophysiological sensing or ablation. The electrode is connected by a wire to driver and . measurement circuitry in a control unit 30.<br>
A plurality of body-surface electrodes, such as adhesive skin patches 32, 34, 36, and 38 (collectively referred to hereinbelow as patches 32-38) are coupled to a body-surface (e.g., the skin) of subject 26. Patches 32-38 may be placed, at any convenient locations on the body-surface in the vicinity of the medical procedure. Typically, the locations of the skin patches are spaced apart. For example, for cardiac applications, patches 32-38 are typically placed around the chest of subject<br>
BI05082USNP	13<br><br>
Patches 32-38 are also connected by wires to control unit 30. The control unit determines position coordinates of catheter 22 inside heart 24 based on the currents measured between the catheter and each of patches 32-38 as described hereinbelow. The control unit drives a monitor 42, which shows the catheter position inside the body. The catheter may be used in generating a map 44 of the heart, and the displayed catheter position may be superimposed on this map or on another image of the heart.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic detail view, showing catheter 22 inside heart 24, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Typically, catheter 22 comprises at least one electrode 48, as described hereinabove. In. the pictured embodiment, electrode 48 communicates with one or more of patches 32-38. Control unit 30 drives a current between electrode 48 and one or more of patches 32-38. Currents through the one or more patches (referred to hereinbelow as patch currents) are measured by one or more of respective current measurement circuits 52, 54, 56, and 58 (collectively referred to hereinbelow as circuits 52-58). A measurement circuit is typically configured to be affixed to a body surface patch, or, alternatively, to be situated within control unit 30.<br>
Currents measured by circuits 52-58 are indicative of impedances between the catheter and the respective patches. Using methods described below with reference to Fig. 3, the measured currents may be used to calculate parameters of relative impedance, which are in turn used to derive coordinates of the catheter.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram schematically illustrating a method for tracking catheter 22 inside heart 24, in<br>
BI05082USNP	14<br><br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method comprises a patch calibration stage 60 and a tracking stage 66. Patch calibration is typically carried out initially, before practitioner 28 begins manipulating the catheter in the patient's body. Calibration factors derived during calibration stage 60 may be used to correct position measurements made during tracking stage 66. The same configuration of control unit and electrodes may be used both for calibration stage 60 and for tracking stage 66.<br>
At a measurement step 62 of calibration stage 60, control unit 30 successively drives currents between patches 32-38 and acquires current measurements from respective measurement circuits. For example, a calibration driving current may first be applied to patch 32. The other patches 34, 36, and 38 act as current sinks, such that the driving current from patch 32 is split into three calibration patch currents flowing through patches 34, 36, and 38. The three calibration patch currents . are measured using current measurement circuits 54, 56, and 58, respectively. Subsequently, the process is repeated by driving currents from each of patches 34, 36, and 38 in turn, and . measuring the patch currents at the other patches.<br>
At a calculation step 64 of calibration stage 60, the currents measured at measurement step 62 are used to derive calibration factors that may be used subsequently during tracking stage 66. In general, for a parallel circuit comprising a set of N patches, when a current I is driven from a patch j to the other N - 1 patches in the set, the current measured at a patch i may be<br>
BI05082USNP	15<br><br>
represented as Iij, and is related to the calibration driving current I by the equation:<br><br>
wherein aij is the conductance between pairs of patches i<br>
and j, and the denominator of equation (1) represents the conductance of the complete parallel circuit, which is the sum of the conductances between patch j and each of the other N - 1 patches in the set. The calibration patch current Iij may also be written in terms of Rij , the impedance between pairs of patches i and j, as follows:<br><br>
For N patches, there are N(N - 1) ordered patch pairs (i, j) for which values of Iij may be measured.<br>
The impedance Rij is approximately modeled as<br>
(3) R±j = G . Ci . Cj . d±j<br>
wherein Ci is a contact factor for patch i, Cj is a contact factor for patch j, dij is the distance between<br>
patches i and j, and G is a general constant representing medium resistivity.<br>
The values for distances, dij, may be determined using position sensing or manual measurement methods. The contact factors, Ci which are indicative of the impedance between the skin and the patch, represent the effect of several phenomena, including patch surface area, skin<br>
BI05082USNP	16<br><br>
properties, such as moisture and salinity, and impedance effects related to non-ideal current measurement circuits 52-58. Relative values of Ci, that is, values that express each contact factor relative to the sum of all the contact factors, may be solved in terms of the currents, Iij and the distances, dij . The values of Cj<br>
subsequently serve as calibration factors for tracking stage 66.<br>
One method for solving for the relative values of Ci consists of substituting equation (3) into equation (2), giving the following set of N(N - 1) simultaneous equations:<br><br>
Calculation of the values of Cj may be simplified by calculating an intermediate value, Rij , representing the<br>
relative impedance between patch j and patch i. For a given driving current I between patch j and the other N - 1 patches, Rij is defined as the impedance between<br>
patch j and patch i, divided by the sum of the impedances between patch j and each of the other N - 1 patches. That is, Rij is defined- as follows:<br><br>
Substituting equation. (3) into equation (4), gives the following set of N(N - 1) simultaneous equations:<br>
BI05082USNP	17<br><br><br>
As is shown in the Appendix, Rij can be calculated in<br>
terms of the patch currents measured for a given driving current, as follows:<br><br>
Thus, in the set of equations (5), the values of Rlj are known, and the distances dij are known, and we can<br>
therefore derive the remaining unknown values, C, . Rearranging equations (5) gives the following linear system of equations:<br><br>
As diJ = 0 for all i, the k ¹ j parameter of the summation is not required. The final linear system of equations may thus be written as:<br><br>
wherein Xi=Cj are the patch calibration factors.<br>
The system of equations (6) may be used at calculation step 64 to find the relative values of X, . The system of equations is of the type A X = 0 wherein A is an N(N-1)xN matrix that depends on Rij and dij and<br>
wherein X is a vector representing the N values of X1 .<br>
BI05082USNP	18<br><br>
Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of A or eigenvector analysis of the NxN matrix ATA provides a solution for X , as is known in the art.<br>
The relative values of X, are subsequently used during tracking stage 66 to prevent fluctuations in body-surface electrode contact from affecting the position measurements.<br>
During the tracking stage, the control unit drives currents from electrodes 48 to the patches. Typically, at certain intervals during the procedure, tracking stage 66 is interrupted, and calibration stage 60 is repeated.<br>
Tracking stage 66 begins with a measurement step 68, at which control unit 30 drives a current between catheter electrode 48 and two or more of patches 32-38 and measures the currents at each patch, according to the method described above in Fig. 2.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, after the currents between catheter electrode 48 and respective patches 32-38 are measured at step 68, relative impedances between the catheter electrode and the patches are calculated at a position calculation step 70, in a manner similar to that used to determine relative impedances between patches at step 64. The relative impedances between the catheter electrode and the patches provide an indication of the position of the catheter, which control unit 30 may then display on monitor 42, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
At step 70, the control unit typically applies the patch calibration factors derived during calibration stage 60, although tracking stage 66 may also be carried out without patch calibration. The. impedances measured<br>
BI05082USNP	19<br><br>
between the catheter electrode and patches 32-38 are used (along with the patch calibration factors) to calculate relative distances between the catheter electrode and each of the patches. These distances may then be used to determine absolute spatial coordinates of the catheter. Relative distances are determined using the equations derived hereinbelow.<br>
The impedance between the catheter electrode and a patch i may be modeled as<br>
(7) Ri = G . X, . Ccath ¦ di<br>
wherein Xi is the calibration factor for patch i, Ccath is a contact constant for catheter electrode 48, d1 is the distance between patch i and catheter electrode 48, and G is the general constant representing medium resistivity. The current driven from the . catheter electrode and flowing into a patch i is represented as patch current I1 , and is related to the driving current I by the equation:<br><br>
Following a derivation similar to that described above at step 64, relative values of distance di may be determined by generating a set of equations for relative impedances, Ri , which is defined as:<br><br>
Substituting equation (7) into equation (8), gives the following set of N simultaneous .equations:<br>
BI05082USNP	20<br><br><br>
Ri is independent of both the medium resistivity G and the catheter contact Ccath i.e., position measurements made in this fashion are insensitive to impedance variations caused by catheter contact with internal body tissues. Following a derivation similar to that described in the Appendix, Ri can be calculated in terms of the patch currents measured for a given driving current, as follows:<br><br>
The only unknown variables in the set of equations (9) are therefore the relative values of d1 . Rearranging equations (9) gives the following linear system of equations:<br><br>
The system of equations (10) has N unknowns di and N<br>
equations and is of the type A . d = 0 wherein A is an NxN matrix that depends on Ri and Xi . The solutions for the N relative values of di are found by SVD analysis of<br>
A, or eigenvector analysis of ATA .<br>
If an initial catheter position is known, the relative distance values di may be used at calculation step 70 to derive the relative movement of the catheter from the initial catheter position.<br>
BI05082USNP	21<br><br>
Alternatively or additionally, when four or more patches are used, absolute coordinates of the catheter electrode may be calculated at calculation step 70. Four unknown parameters are derived, including the three spatial coordinates of the catheter electrode, which may be represented as a vector q, and a multiplicative constant, a , which generates the absolute distances from the relative distances, di, calculated above.<br>
To solve for the four parameters, the absolute distance between the catheter electrode and patch 1, represented as a d1 , is equated to the absolute difference between the spatial coordinates of the catheter electrode and of the patch i, which may be represented as ||q — pi|| , wherein pi is a vector representing the coordinates of patch i. The equality provides a set of N equations of the form:<br>
(11) ||q - pi\\ = a . di.<br>
The values for q and a in the set of equations (11) may be solved using a minimization algorithm, such as the least squares method, which may be performed by minimization of the expression:<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the relative impedance, defined above as a ratio of an impedance and the sum of impedances, may be defined as a difference between measured impedances. In another alternative embodiment, a ratio may be taken between an impedance reading at each body-surface patch and the sum of readings at several other catches.<br>
BI05082USNP	22<br><br>
When catheter 22 moves, the relative impedance with respect to at least one patch changes. The measurement of the change in relative impedance thereby permits tracking of the catheter.<br>
By contrast, when catheter electrode 48 touches internal tissue, the patch currents will change, but the values of relative impedance will not change. Consequently, as noted above, errors in position measurement due to tissue contact are reduced when the methods described above are used. These methods further provide a means of evaluating internal tissue contact by sensing when changes in current are not reflected by changes in the relative impedances.<br>
Although the methods described above are illustrated in the context of a catheter-based system for diagnosis or treatment of conditions of the heart, the principles of the present invention may similarly be used in position tracking systems for the diagnosis or treatment of other body structures, such as the brain, spine, skeletal joints, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract, prostrate, and uterus.<br>
Furthermore, although the impedance calibration and position tracking techniques of stages 60 and 66 are described hereinabove as two complementary parts of a single position tracking method, in alternative embodiments these techniques may be used independently of one another. For example, the patch calibration technique described above may be used to determine and measure changes in the impedances of electrodes in other impedance-based tracking systems, as well as in other diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that use multiple electrodes on and/or in the body. Furthermore, position<br>
BI05082USNP	23<br><br>
tracking based on relative impedance, as in stage 66 above, is a useful method of increasing the accuracy and reliability of position measurements even in the absence of specific calibration of the impedances of body-surface electrodes.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and sub-combinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art.<br>

APPENDIX<br>
Derivation of Relation between Relative Impedance and Patch Currents:<br>
In general, for a parallel circuit comprising a set of N nodes, such as electrode patches, wherein a current I is driven from a node j to the other N - 1 nodes in the set, the current measured at a node i may be represented as Iii, and is related to impedances between the nodes,<br>
Rij , by the equation:<br><br>
Inverting both sides of the equation (Al) gives an equation for the inverse of Iij as follows:<br><br>
The sum of inverses of all Iij for a given driving current is  Dividing both sides, of (A2) by this sum<br>
gives:<br><br>
BI05082USNP	25<br><br><br>
As described in the Specification hereinabove, a relative impedance, Rij , is defined as the impedance between node j and node i, divided by the sum of the impedances between node j and each of the other N - 1 nodes. Rij can thus be expressed as:<br><br>
Substituting equation (A3) into equation (A4), gives ah equation for Rij in terms of Iij, as follows:<br><br>
