				<td>REPLACEADLE INTEGRATED WATER FILTRATION AND STERILIZATION CARTRIDGE AND ASSEMBLY THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates generally to a replaceable integrated water filtration and sterilization cartridge and housing assembly therefor which is capable of removing particulates, organic materials, inorganic materials and/or heavy metal materials from a water stream, while also sterilizing the filtered water stream to destroy most microorganisms, bacteria and viruses contained therein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As environmental agencies become more aware of the potential health risks associated with drinking either municipal or well water, there has been an every increasing need for residential water purification systems which are capable of removing organics, inorganics, particulates, microorganisms, bacteria and viruses from the water supply prior to consumption. Most conventional systems require a series of filtration and chlorification units to properly remove such matters from the water. These units are extremely costs to install and maintain, and take up a lot of space making them unfit for countertop use<br>
Filtration media has been used for years to remove particulates from the water supply, while carbon block filters have been effective in removal of organics and inorganics   However, conventional filters are incapable of removing microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts or molds   Ultraviolet radiation in the 200-300 nanometer range have been extremely effective in killing such microorganisms. As such, germicidal lamps have been used extensively in air and water purification, sewage treatment, protection of food and beverages, and other disinfection and sterilization applications<br>
Recent efforts by filtration manufacturers have resulted in the creation of a water purification system which combines the disinfection and sterilization capabilities of ultraviolet radiation with the paticulate, organic and inorganic filtering capabilities of conventional filter media   This combined system provides<br>
extremely pure and sterilized drinking water regardless of the origin of the water source<br>
These conventional two stage water purification systems typically include an ultraviolet lamp affixed to the base unit of a filtration housing assembly and protected by a stainless steel sheath or sleeve. A conventional carbon block filter is removably slid over the outside of the sleeve and then the filter housing is placed over the carbon filter and screwed into the base. Typically, the ultraviolet lamp is placed within a quartz tube and replaceable mounted to the base.<br>
Two stage water purification systems as discussed above require periodic maintenance such as replacing the carbon block filter approximately every six months (more frequently if needed), replacing the ultraviolet lamp every twelve months to insure proper performance (i.e., lamp may not burn-out, but disinfection capacity does diminish over time), and quartz tube should be cleaned every six months. Although the carbon block filter is easy to replace, i.e., simply unscrew the filter housing and slide the filter off the stainless steel sleeve at the open end, replacement of the ultraviolet lamp requires substantial disassembly of the base unit of the housing. Since the ultraviolet lamp replacement is extremely difficult, many end-users (i.e., homeowners) will tend to not replace such lamps as frequently as necessary. If the lamp is not replaced on a periodic basis its effectiveness in disinfecting and sterilizing water will diminish over time, thus posing a health risk to unwary end-users.<br>
Therefore, it would be highly desirable to have a two stage water â€¢ purification system which allows for easy removal and replacement of both the filter and the ultraviolet lamp. In this regard, the present inventor has developed a unique replaceable integrated filtration/sterilization cartridge which is readily and easily removable from the filter housing assembly   This integrated filtration/sterilization cartridge comprises both the ultraviolet lamp and filter member together as one single unit which may be removed from the base unit of the housing assembly without the need for any tools or detailed instructions Moreover, the concept of combining the filter member and the ultraviolet lamp in a single replaceable cartridge will cause the unsophisticated homeowner or end-use to replace both elements at the same time, thereby avoiding the inherent health<br>
risks of leaving a still illuminating, but less effective, ultraviolet lamp within the<br>
*<br>
filter assembly<br>

Outer housing 5 is secured to base unit 3 by means of a clap 4 or any other conventional means of securing these two component together, e.g., screw fitting. As cartridge 15 is secured to base unit 3 a permeate channel 7 is formed between outer surface 53 of first end plate 17 and the adjacent surface 55 of base unit 3 by means of o-rings 57 and 59 which create a fluid-tight seal between base unit 3 and first end plate 17. Similarly, a feed channel 11 is formed between outer surface 53 of first end plate 17 and the adjacent surface 55 of base unit 3 by means of o-rings 59 and 61. These o-rings (57,59,61) can be formed from any elastomeric material (e.g., rubber) or any other material which is capable of forming a fluid-tight seal between the two surfaces. The relationship of o-rings (57,59,61), permeate channel 7 and feed channel 11 can be seen in Fig. 4.<br>
As such, cartridge 15 may be sealed or self contained encapsulation within outef housing 5 and base unit 3 for as to form a permeate channel 7, feed channel 11 and a lamp compartment which is normal disposed within permeate channel 7. Sealing permeate channel 7, feed channel 11 and lamp 21 from each other can be accomplished by any combination of the following methods: elastomeric gasket, knife-over-gasket, compression o-ring, gland o-ring, grommet, glue adhesive, hot melt, in-situ end plate formation, insert molding, welding such as hot welding, solvent welding, ultrasonic welding, RF welding, EMA Bondâ„¢ and compression fitting.<br>
Another embodiment according to the present invention involves an in-line filtration/sterilization assembly which is capable of being replaceably mounted directly within a conduit carrying a feed stream such as water. The assembly comprises: a filtration housing 71 which includes a base unit 73 and an outer housing 75. Base unit 73 comprises a port means 77 for removing permeate from the assembly, and outer housing 75 comprises a port means 79 for feeding the feed stream into the assembly. Disposed within filtration housing 71 is an integrated filtration and sterilization cartridge 81 which comprises: a first end plate 83 and a second end plate 85; an ultraviolet lamp 87 disposed within a quartz tube 89 and affixed to first end plate 83; and a filtration member 91 disposed between first and second end plates (83,85). Filtration member 91 is preferably affixed to both first and second end plates (83,85) and disposed about ultraviolet lamp 87 thereby forming a permeate chamber 93 between ultraviolet lamp 87 and the inner surface 95 of filtration member 91. Base unit 73 is disposed at the opposite end of cartridge 81 as outer housing 75 so as to form a permeate compartment 99 between the inner surface 101 of base unit 73 and the outer surface 103 of first end plate 83 and wherein permeate compartment 99 is in contact with port means 77 for removing permeate from the assembly   First end plate 83 comprises at least one permeate through-hole 97 disposed therein and in contact with both permeate chamber 93 and permeate compartment 99. Outer housing 75 is disposed about cartridge 81 so as to form a feed chamber 105 between the inner surface 107 of the outer housing 75 and the outer surface 109 of filtration member 91 and wherein feed chamber 105 is in contact with port means 79 for feeding the feed stream into the assembly. This in-line assembly can be readily attached to a feed stream<br>
conduit by simply threading means 79 and means 77 to portions of the conduit, or by any other conventional removable sealing means, such as snap fitting.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 depicts another embodiment according to the present invention wherein second end plate 111 is affixed to the upper portion of filtration member 27 by any of the aforementioned methods. Second end plate 111 includes an elastomeric portion or gasket 113 which creates a fluid-tight seal between second end plate 111 and knife section 115 disposed about inner surface 37 outer housing 5. Gasket 113 is forced against knife 115 when bottom unit 3 is securely connected to outer housing 5. In accordance with this embodiment a feed stream enters base unit 3 via conduit 117 and passes between first end plate 119 and inner surface 37 of outer housing 5 into feed channel 35. First end plate 119 is affixed to an opposite end of filtration member 27 and include an elastomeric portion or gasket 121 which create a seal between first end plate 119 and base unit 3 when base unit 3 is securely connected to outer housing 5. The fluid-tight seal is formed by contact between gasket 121 and a knife 123 molded into base unit 3. The feed stream permeates through filtration member 27 into permeate channel 29 where it comes into contact with the ultraviolet radiation emitted from ultraviolet lamp 21 The treated permeate passes from permeate channel 29 through a permeate conduit 125 formed between first end plate 119 and the outer side wall of quartz tube 51 After passing through permeate conduit 125, the treated permeate passes through a permeate hole 127 into permeate chamber 129 disposed within base unit 3. Thereafter, the treated permeate passes out of base unit 3 via permeate port 131.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8 it is optional to have a two-plug electric power source connector 133 disposed directly in end cap 25<br>
Fig. 9 is similar to the cartridge shown in Fig. 8, except that is includes a counter current sleeve 141 which comprises a permeable inner layer 143 and an impermeable outer layer 145. Permeable inner layer 143 is typically formed of a permeable material such as plastic or stainless steel wire mesh or non-woven fabric (e.g., Typarâ„¢)   Impermeable outer layer 145 is typically an impermeable plastic or metal sheet. It is preferable that counter current sleeve 141 be wrapped or otherwise dispose about the inner surface of filtration member 27   Counter current sleeve 141 allows the permeate to pass through permeable layer 143 and out the<br>
top thereof such that the permeate is required to traverse the enter length of permeate chamber 29 in order to increase its residence time within permeate chamber 29 before exiting via permeate conduit 125.<br>
Fig. 10 depicts base unit 3 and Fig. 11 is top plan view of Fig. 10.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 are similar to Fig. 7, except that the permeate exits permeate channel via permeate port 151. Also, first end plate 153 is affixed to the inner surface of quartz tube 51 via elastomeric sealing means 23, and second end plate 155 is open ended such that permeate may pass therethrough into permeate conduit 151.<br>
Fig. 14 is similar to Fig. 12, except that first end plate 161 is formed of an elastomeric material which is capable of forming a fluid-tight seal between first end plate 161 and the outer surface of quartz tube 51, thus avoiding the need for gaskets, o-ring, grommets or the like. Since both second end plate 163 and first end plate 161 are formed of an elastomeric material there is no need to gaskets 113 and 121, respectively, since knives 115 and 123 can create a fluid-tight seal by coming into contact with first and second end plates (161,163).<br>
In each of Figs. 7, 12 and 14 outer housing 5 and base unit 3 form a fluid-tight seal therebetween by means of gasket or o-right 165.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
