				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an automatic parking system and more particularly to an optical parking system for motor vehicles<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
In the big metropolitan cities, the excessive increase in the number of vehicles has led to traffic congestion and traffic bottlenecks. The parking of the vehicles in commercial as well as residential complexes has become a big problem. As such, there is a need for optimum use of the space available for parking. There is a need for parking systems, which can regulate the parking of the vehicles in the parking space in such a manner so as to maximise the space utilisation for parking resulting in parking of maximum number of vehicles in the given parking space. Further, the system should regulate the parking of vehicles in a manner so as there is no dent on the incoming or outgoing vehicles in the parking space due to the collision with other vehicles.<br>
There are some parking systems available in the prior art. In one of the parking system, available in the prior art, the vehicles are parked in the multi-layered parking space. The vehicles are lifted upwards through motor driven chain. However, this type of parking system suffers from the disadvantage that it is costly and involves complex mechanical system.<br>
In another type of parking system, known in the prior art, the vehicles are parked in a silo structure. In this parking system, the drivers of the vehicle leave their vehicles in the parking lane which serve as a loading pick-up point and the vehicles are automatically transferred to a parking bay However, this parking system also suffers from the disadvantage that it is a costly system involving huge infrastructure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Primary object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system which helps in maximising parking space utilisation.<br>

Yet another object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which is highly efficient.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which helps in avoiding the collision of incoming or outgoing vehicles with the already parked vehicles.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which is extremely cheaper.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which can be easily made and installed.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which can operated in day and night both.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which can work in all weather conditions including fog, mist and rain.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which has a large visibility range.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which does not need manual intervention for parking arrangement.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, can be installed at any elevation/altitude.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an optical parking system, which is self-illuminating and which does not need any external illumination source. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an optical parking system for motor vehicles characterized by two high contrast grating having equal alternatively spaced uniform black and white strip grating of thickness 7 cm and spaced at a distance of 7 cm, fixed on two glass plates alongwith a diffusing screen, the said glass plates in turn are fixed on wooden frames at angle 110° to each other and disposed in a wooden box; the said wooden box illuminated with an illumination source facing the diffusing screen and having a front glass plate for viewing the fringe pattern forced due to interference between said two gratings.<br><br>
To accordance with this invention the optical parking system for motor vehicles is based upon moire fringe technique. The optical parking system of the present invention can be utilised to maximise the parking space available for parking of the vehicles. The optical parking system of the present invention is simpler, cheaper and easier to operate. The system can be easily installed at any elevation and it does not need complex mechanical arrangements. The parking system is self-illuminating and it does not need any external illumination source. It has a large visibility range and it does not need manual intervention for facilitating parking of the vehicles inside the parking space. The installation of the optical parking system of the present invention helps in avoiding the collision of the incoming or outgoing vehicles with the already parked vehicles in the parking space. The parking system of the present invention depends upon the passive optical interaction between the driver's line of vision and the moire pattern produced by the optical parking system and it can be utilised in day time as well night time irrespective of the weather conditions.<br>
Any further characteristics, advantages and applications of the invention will become evident from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which has been descried and illustrated with the help of following drawings wherein, initial position as shown in the top portion of the figure, inside the parking space. The perfect position of the parking is indicated by the bottom position of the motor vehicle. Similarly, the other incoming motor vehicles, entering the parking space, are guided by the Moire fringe pattern. Finally, this results in orderly parking of the motor vehicles inside the parking space with maximum space utilization.<br>
The present embodiment of the invention, which has been set froth above, was for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is to be understood that various changes, adaptations and the art without departing from the scope of the invention, which has been defined by following claims.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig 1 shows the isometric view of the optical parking system of tne present invention.<br>
Fig 2 shows the formation of vertical Moire fringe pattern depending upon the various positions of the motor vehicles in the parking space.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS:<br>
The optical parking system of the present invention is based upon the formation of Moire fringe pattern. The Moire fringe pattern is formed witn superposition of periodic objects of nearly the same periodicity and the most commonly used objects are gratings with equal opaque and transparent region The effect of Moire pattern is most pronounced if the spacing between the repetitive elements in each pattern is nearly equal and the angle of intersection between the two pattern is small. The optical parking system of the present invention utilizes Moire fringe pattern formed by superposition of two similar linear gratings in which one grating is a plane 2-D and the second grating has been bended at the center. The optical parking system depends entirely on a passive optical interaction between driver's line of vision and the Moire fringe pattern produced by the parking system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, two similar gratings (5) of equal spacing with high contrast (black and white).are pasted on the glass plates. These glass plates are of the dimension 40cm x 30 cm each and these are kept at an angle of 110° and the other side, facing the electric bulb (2), acts as a diffusing screen (4). The size of an individual black strip in the grating is about 7 cm and the spacing between such two black strips are kept at about 7 cm. These two gratings are fixed into wooden frames, which, in turn, are adjusted and aligned in a wooden box of the size of about 40 cm width, 40 cm height and 60 cm length. The front side of the box has a glass plate (6) with straight strips through which the driver of the vehicle can observe the fringes. The front glass plate is about 20-25 cm away from the first inclined wooden frame inside the box containing the grating. The box is illuminated with a light bulb (2) placed at one end of the wooden box (1). The wooden box (1) contains a number of holes along it's length which provide ventilation to the hot air Once the light bulb (2) is illuminated, the incoherent light passes through the folded grating and ultimately falls on the folded grating.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the pattern of Moire Fringes, as seen by the drivers of the motor vehicles depending upon the positions of their motor vehicles in the parking space, has been shown. In the parking space, the optical parking systems of the present invention are installed in a row. The driver of any incoming motor vehicle observes the Moire fringe pattern as made on the front glass plate of the optical parking system. The tilted pattern of the Moire Fringe pattern indicates that the parking of the motor vehicle is not proper and accordingly the driver changes the position of the vehicle, starting from the<br><br><br><br><br>
