				<td>IMPROVED CONFIGURATION AND PROCESS FOR CARBONYL REMOVAL<br>
This application claims the benefit of our co-pending International patent application<br>
with the serial number PCT/US03/02696, filed on 01/28/2003, and which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
Field of The Invention<br>
The field of the invention is gas purification, and especially removal of metal carbonyls<br>
from gases for combustion and/or synthesis.<br>
Background of The Invention<br>
Gasification of residues, and especially of heavy oil based products (e.g., petroleum coke<br>
visbreaker bottoms, asplmltenes, vacuum bottoms, etc.), is often accompanied by generation of<br>
significant quantities of metal carbonyls. For example, nickel and/or iron carbonyls are typically<br>
formed in gasification of vacuum bottoms. Metal carbonyls are highly undesirable as they are noi<br>
only toxic and carcinogenic at relatively low quantities, but also plate in various portions of a<br>
combustion turbine.<br>
To avoid such problems, numerous approaches have been developed to at least partially<br>
remove metal carbonyls from various gas streams. For example, surfaces in contact with a gas<br>
stream containing the metal carbonyls may be coated with austenitic (18/8) stainless steel to<br>
avoid reaction with the metal carbonyls. While such a coating may reduce metal plating on the<br>
so treated surfaces to at least some degree, use of stainless steel is relatively expensive.<br>
Furthermore, coating of surfaces susceptible to metal plating with stainless steel will not (at least<br>
to a significant degree) reduce the concentration of metal carbonyls in the gas stream and<br>
therefore only shift the problems associated with metal carbonyls to a location downstream of<br>
the stainless steel coating,<br>
In another approach, Dvorak et ai. employed spent catalysts comprising Cu and/or CuO<br>
and ZnO to reduce the concentration of sulfur compounds and iron carbonyl in a gas stream<br>
(Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 96 (1982), Abstract No. 164.903e). While the spent catalysts were<br>
relatively effective for removal of sulfur compounds, only small amounts of iron carbonyl were<br>
removed from the gases. Moreover, Cu and CuO sorbents are known to exhibit significant<br>
activity as hydrogenation catalysts. Consequently, when such catalysts are used in syngas,<br>
conversion of at least a portion of the syngas to methane and alcohols is almost unavoidable.<br>
To improve removal of iron carbonyl from a gas stream, the gas stream may be contacted<br>
with ZnO and or ZnS as proposed in EP023911A2, In such systems, ZnO and/or ZnS reduced<br>
the concentration of iron carbonyl to a significant extent (e.g., 99%), however, nickel carbonyl<br>
was removed in this system to a considerably lower degree (e.g., 77%).<br>
In yet another approach, zeolites have been employed to reduce metal carbonyls from gas<br>
streams (Golden et al. Sep. Sci, and Techn, (1991), 26, 12: 1559-1574). While zeolites typically<br>
reduce the concentration of metal carbonyls from a syngas with relatively high efficiency, the<br>
zeolites system described by Golden et al was limited to gas streams that are substantially free of<br>
hydrogen sulfide.<br>
In a still further approach, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,384 to Carr, a gas stream<br>
containing metal carbonyis is contacted with lead oxide that is bound on a solid support (e.g.,<br>
alumina). Lead oxide-based removal of metal carbonyls, and particularly iron carbonyl, is<br>
relatively effective, however, has various significant disadvantages. Among other things, the gas<br>
stream typically needs to be free of appreciable quantities of sulfur compounds to avoid sorbent<br>
poisoning. Furthermore, a highly toxic lead nitrate solution is employed to coat the carrier via a<br>
calcination process, which poses environmental and health hazards. Moreover, operation of lead<br>
oxide beads at temperatures higher than 100Â°C will tend to produce carbon deposits, especially<br>
in the absence of hydrogen.<br>
To circumvent at least some of the problems associated with lead oxide, a hydrophobic<br>
porous adsorbent may be employed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,428 to Eijkhout et al.<br>
Suitable adsorbents include Si/Al-containing zeolites with a pore size of between about 0.5 nm<br>
to 4,0 nm and an average pore volume of 0.005ml/g sorbent. Among various other advantages,<br>
Eijkhout's system can operate under conditions where the gas stream comprises significant<br>
amounts of hydrogen sulfide and water. However, effective removal of metal carbonyls is at<br>
least in part dependent on proper pore size as Si/Al-containing zeolites are thought to act as<br>
molecular sieves. Consequently, disposal of saturated Si/Al-containing zeolites will still pose<br>
substantial health and environmental risks due to the high toxicity and low boiling point of metal<br>
carbonyls.<br>
Further known adsorption methods for metal carbonyis include those described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 3,466,340 in which iron carbonyl is removed from liquid methanol or other alcohols<br>
using a solid ion exchange resin containing amino groups. Similarly, in French Pat. No.<br>
2,040,232, iron carbonyl-contaminated methanol is passed through a bed of Fe2O3 pellets to<br>
remove the iron carbonyl.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,239, the inventors describe iron carbonyl removal from a gas using<br>
alkali metal hydroxide in association with a high boiling hydroxylic solvent to form nonvolatile<br>
iron carbonylate salts, which are then separated from the gas. Alternatively, as described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 3,780,163, ozone is reacted with iron carbonyl from a gas containing carbon monoxide<br>
or from a liquid (e.g., ethyl acetate). However, all, or almost all of such known processes either<br>
result in a relatively toxic product that needs to be disposed of, or use highly toxic reagents that<br>
need to be destroyed or otherwise removed where such reagents are employed in molar excess to<br>
the metal carbonyl.<br>
Therefore, although various configurations and processes are known in the art to remove<br>
metal carbonyls from a gas stream, all or almost all suffer from one or more disadvantages.<br>
Thus, there is still a need for improved configurations and processes for carbonyl removal.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to plants having an adsorber that includes a sacrificial<br>
non-metallic material onto which a metal is plated from a metal carbonyl-containing feed gas at<br>
a predetermined temperature. Contemplated metal carbonyls include nickel carbonyl, iron<br>
carbonyl, and cobalt carbonyl, and especially suitable feed gases include those produced from<br>
gasification of petroleum coke, visbreaker bottoms, asphaltenes, and/or vacuum bottoms.<br>
In especially preferred aspects, the sacrificial non-metallic material comprises graphite,<br>
and the feed gas comprises a syngas frqm a gasification plant. Consequently, the predetermined<br>
temperatures will generally be in the range of between 150 Â°C to 200 Â°C. Where the metal is<br>
nickel, preferred temperatures are between 150 Â°C to 170 Â°C, and where the metal is iron, the<br>
preferred temperature is between 180 Â°C to 200 Â°C.<br>
Further preferred configurations also include those in which the adsorber has a first and<br>
second section (both comprising the sacrificial non-metallic material), wherein nickel is plated<br>
onto the material in the first section at a temperature between 150 Â°C to 170 Â°C, and wherein iron<br>
is plated onto the material in the second section at a temperature between 180 Â°C to 200 Â°C.<br>
It is further contemplated that in at least some plants the adsorber will be coupled to at<br>
least one component (e.g., gas turbine coupled to a power generator) of an integrated gasification<br>
combined cycle plant, and/or that the feed gas is heated by a gas turbine feed gas preheater. To<br>
reduce, or even prevent plating of a metal onto the heat exchanger, it is further contemplated that<br>
the feed gas is heated by an aluminums-containing surface in a heat exchanger. Furthermore, it is<br>
generally contemplated that a second adsorber may be employed in series (or parallel) to allow<br>
for continuous operation.<br>
Therefore, a method of reducing a metal carbonyl concentration in a feed gas includes<br>
one step in which a feed gas is provided that includes a metal carbonyl. In another step, the feed<br>
gas is contacted in an adsorber with a sacrificial non-metallic material at a temperature sufficient<br>
to plate a metal from the metal carbonyl onto the sacrificial non-metallic material. With respect<br>
to the components, temperatures, materials, and configurations, the same considerations as<br>
provided above apply.<br>
Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
along with the accompanying drawing.<br>
Brief Deicriptjon of the^ Drawing<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic configuration of an exemplary adsorber according to the<br>
inventive subject matter,<br>
Detailed Description<br>
As used herein, the term "metal carbonyl" refers to a molecule in which a metal in ionic<br>
form forms a compound with (C0)n~, wherein n is typically between 1 and 8, and includes mixed<br>
metal carbonyls, in which at least one (CO)n" and one other anion form the compound.<br>
Particularly contemplated metal carbonyls include nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4), iron carbonyl<br>
(Fe(CO)s), and cobalt carbonyl ((CO)3Co:(CO)2:Co(CO)3). Consequently, particularly<br>
contemplated metals include nickel, iron, and cobalt.<br>
As also used herein, the term "the metal plates" refers to the decomposition of a metal<br>
:arbonyl (which may be in gas and/or liquid phase) and the concomitant deposition of the metal,<br>
therein the metal deposit in elemental form on the sacrificial non-metallic material. Thus, it<br>
should be pointed out that the configurations and methods according to the inventive subject<br>
matter are drawn to those in which at least part of the metal carbonyl in the feed gas is<br>
decomposed and plated as a metal onto the sacrificial non-metallic material. Viewed from<br>
another perspective, the majority (i.e., at least 50%) of the metal carbonyl is not bound<br>
(absorbed) to a solid phase.<br>
As further used herein, the term "sacrificial non-metallic material" refers to any material<br>
onto which a metal can be plated from a metal carbonyl, wherein such material is predominantly<br>
comprised of atoms other than a metal (i.e., at least 50 atom%). Therefore, suitable materials<br>
include various inorganic and organic materials, and all reasonable mixtures thereof. However, it<br>
is particularly preferred that the sacrificial non-metallic material predominantly comprises<br>
carbon (i.e., at least 80 atom%, more preferably at least 90 atom%, and most preferably at least<br>
98 atom%). For example, especially suitable forms of carbon include graphite, activated carbon,<br>
vitreous carbon, fulierenes, etc. Where it is desired that the sacrificial non-metallic material<br>
comprises an inorganic material, numerous silicon-, calcium-, or magnesium-containing<br>
materials are contemplated. Among such materials, silicates, alumina, and clays are typically<br>
preferred.<br>
Furthermore, it should be recognized that contemplated sacrificial non-metallic materials<br>
may also include one or more metals on the surface or incorporated in to the material. For<br>
example, where the sacrificial non-metallic material is predominantly silicate or zeolite, the<br>
material may be coated or doped with iron.<br>
Consequently, it should be appreciated that the size and configuration of contemplated<br>
sacrificial non-metallic materials may vary considerably, and a particular size and configuration<br>
will at least to some degree be determined by the specific materials employed. For example,<br>
where the sacrificial non-metallic material is a graphite, powdered, pelletized, or otherwise<br>
shaped graphite may be employed. Similarly, wherein the sacrificial non-metallic material<br>
comprises vitreous carbon, it is generally preferred that such materials may be in form of a<br>
carbon felt. In other aspects, where the sacrificial non-metallic material comprises a silicate or<br>
other mineral material, the sacrificial non-metallic material may be shaped in spheres, which<br>
may further include openings of predetermined size (e.g., molecular sieves).<br>
With respect to the amount of contemplated sacrificial non-metallic materials used in the<br>
adsorber, it is generally contemplated that the quantity of sacrificial non-metallic material will be<br>
determined by the actual and/or expected quantity of metal carbonyls in the feed gas. However, it<br>
is typically preferred that the amount is selected such that continuous operation of the adsorber<br>
can be performed for at least one day, more typically at least 10 days, and most typically at least<br>
30 days.<br>
Still further, it should be recognized that where the adsorber has a first and a second<br>
section (infra), the sacrificial non-metallic materials in the first and second sections may be<br>
identical or different. For example, where the feed gas comprises nickel carbonyl and iron<br>
carbonyl, the sacrificial non-metallic material in the first section may be graphite (to thereby<br>
generate nickel coated graphite, which is a commercial commodity), while the sacrificial nonmetallic<br>
material in the second section may be iron (to thereby generate iron coated iron, which<br>
may be disposed of in numerous manfters without significant negative environmental impact).<br>
Suitable metals (and further configurations) for use in conjunction with the teachings presented<br>
herein include those described in our copending International patent application with the serial<br>
number PCT/US03/02696, filed on 01/28/2003, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In a particularly preferred aspect of the inventive subject matter, as depicted in Figure 1,<br>
an adsorber configuration 100 includes an adsorber vessel 110 includes a first section 110A that<br>
includes sacrificial non-metallic material 120, and a second section 11 OB that includes sacrificial<br>
20 non-metallic material 120 (chemically identical with the material of the first section 110 A). Feed<br>
gas 130 is heated to a first temperature Tl in a heat exchanger 140 against treated feed gas<br>
stream 134 to heated feed gas 130', which enters the first section 110A of adsorber 110. The feed<br>
gas leaving the first adsorber 132 is then further heated to a second temperature T2 in heater 150<br>
to form the further heated feed gas 132', which then enters the second section 110B of adsorber<br>
110. Treated feed gas stream 134 leaves the adsorber after passing through the second section<br>
110B, and heat is extracted from the treated feed gas stream 134 in exchanger 140 to heat the<br>
feed gas stream 130,<br>
With respect to the adsorber, it is generally contemplated that suitable adsorbers may<br>
have any configuration and/or dimension so long as the contemplated adsorbers include at least<br>
some sacrificial non-metallic material, receive a feed gas, and provide the feed gas after<br>
contacting the sacrificial non-metallic material to a downstream device (e.g., gas turbine).<br>
However, in a particularly preferred aspect of the inventive subject matter, the adsorber<br>
comprises a container with a first and second section in which a first and second metal plate onto<br>
the sacrificial material, respectively. Alternatively, and especially where only one metal carbonyl<br>
is present in the feed gas (or another metal carbonyl is present in relatively low quantities<br>
compared to the first metal carbonyl), suitable adsorbers may include only one section.<br>
It is generally preferred that contemplated adsorbers are positioned downstream of a gas<br>
turbine feed gas preheater (e.g,, a syngas preheater), and upstream of the gas turbine. While not<br>
limiting to the inventive subject matter, it is especially preferred that contemplated plants include<br>
at least two adsorbers (which may be in parallel/adjacent position relative to each other), which<br>
are fluidly couplsd in series such that a first adsorber receives the preheated feed gas, and<br>
provides a substantially metal carbonyl depleted (i.e., at least 95mol%, more typically at least<br>
98mol%, most typically at least 99mol%) feed gas to the second adsorber, which in this<br>
configuration acts as a guard bed and provides the substantially metal carbonyl depleted feed gas<br>
to the gas turbine, Furtheimore, it is especially preferred that in contemplated configurations the<br>
first and second adsorbers are fluidly coupled to a downstream device (e.g., gas turbine) using<br>
bypass piping such that (a) the first adsorber can be removed from the plant while the feed gas is<br>
continuously provided to the gas turbine via the second adsorber, and (b) that after removing the<br>
first adsorber and installing a replacement adsorber with a fresh batch of sacrificial material the<br>
second adsorber will act as the leading adsorber (i.e., as the first adsorber).<br>
In alternative configurations, however, the number of adsorbers may vary considerably,<br>
and appropriate configurations may include between one and six adsorbers, and even more. For<br>
example, where a gas turbine receives a discontinuous supply of feed gas, only one adsorber may<br>
be employed. On the other hand, where substantially complete depletion of a continuous supply<br>
of feed gas is required, three and even more adsorbers may be employed.<br>
Consequently, depending on the particular number and configuration of adsorbers, two or<br>
more adsorbers may be operated in series, in parallel, or in a mixed mode (some adsorbers serial<br>
and other adsorbers parallel). However, it is generally preferred that operation of two or more<br>
adsorbers will allow for continuous flow of the feed gas (and thereby continuous removal of<br>
metal carbonyl from the feed gas) to the gas turbine gas.<br>
Alternatively, and especially where the feed gas comprises syngas that is employed for<br>
synthesis of industrial products (e.g., ammonia, methanol, or other alcohols) or hydrogen<br>
production, it is contemplated that preferred locations of the adsorber or adsorbers are upstream<br>
of a synthesis loop or synthesis reactor. Thus, it should be appreciated that such configurations<br>
advantageously reduce the concentration of metal carbonyls in the synthesis process, which may<br>
adversely affect catalyst performance due to the build-up of the metal carbonyls (and metals) on<br>
the surface of the catalyst.<br>
Consequently, contemplated adsorbers may be employed as a retrofit component, as an<br>
upgrade, or in a new plant construction, and it should be appreciated that a particular nature of<br>
the plant is not limiting to the inventive subject matter. However, it is generally preferred that<br>
suitable plants include a gas turbine, and particularly preferred plants are IGCC plants. Thus, it is<br>
contemplated that the gas turbine is coupled to a power generator. There are numerous power<br>
generators known in the art, and all of the known power generators are contemplated suitable for<br>
use herein Similarly, there are numerous gas turbines known in the art, and all of the known gas<br>
turbines are contemplated suitable for use herein. Exemplary gas turbines include various aircooled<br>
gas turbines, water-cooled gas turbines, and/or integrated steam cooled gas turbines (see<br>
eg,, U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,668).<br>
In further aspects of the inventive subject matter, the nature of suitable feed gas may vary<br>
considerably, and it is generally contemplated that all gas streams are suitable that (a) can be<br>
partially or entirely employed as gas to drive a gas turbine, (b) can be employed for synthesis<br>
purposes (e.g., methanol or ammonia manufacture) and (c) will comprise at least temporarily a<br>
metal carbonyl. However, especially preferred feed gases include gases formed in a gasification<br>
reaction that employs gasification of hydrocarbonaceous materials, and especially heavy oil<br>
refinery residues. For example, suitable gasification materials for generation of contemplated<br>
feed gases include petroleum coke, visbreaker bottoms, asphaltenes, or vacuum bottoms.<br>
Alternatively, numerous other refinery fractions or residues are also considered suitable.<br>
Furthermore, it should be recognized that suitable feed gases may have been treated in<br>
one or more processes that change the chemical composition of the feed gas. For example,<br>
contemplated feed gases may be subjected to one or more shift conversions prior to entering the<br>
adsorber. Alternatively, or additionally, it is contemplated that the feed gas may be subjected to<br>
an acid gas removal process (which may or may not completely remove sulfurous compounds in<br>
the feed gas). Consequently, a particularly preferred feed gas is a syngas from a gasification of<br>
refinery residues after shift conversion and acid gas removal.<br>
Moreover, the feed gas may in further preferred aspects also be subjected to a cooling or<br>
heating step, and it is especially preferred that the feed gas is heated in a gas turbine feed gas<br>
preheater to a temperature of above 100Â°C. There are numerous gas turbine feed gas preheaters<br>
known in the art, and all of those are considered suitable for use herein (wherein the feed gas<br>
heater may also be placed downstream of the adsorber).<br>
With respect to the hest exchangers, it should be recognized that the particular nature of<br>
the heat exchangers will not be critical to the inventive subject matter. Therefore, all suitable<br>
heaters are contemplated appropriate for use herein. Furthermore, where the feed gas is<br>
preheated to the first temperature Tl, it should be appreciated that the first heat exchangers may<br>
be omitted. Regardless of the number of heat exchangers, it is generally preferred that the<br>
portion of the heat exchanger that contacts the feed gas is coated with or comprises a material<br>
onto which the metal will not, or only to a relatively small degree plate out. For example,<br>
suitable materials include aluminum, or stainless steel.<br>
The particular temperature Tl will typically depend on the specific first metal carbonyl<br>
and/or the sacrificial non-metal material, and it is generally preferred that all temperatures are<br>
suitable at which at least a portion of the first metal will plate onto the sacrificial material.<br>
However, it is even more preferred that the temperature will allow substantially complete (i.e., at<br>
least 90%) plating of the first metal from the first metal carbonyl on to the sacrificial material.<br>
Similarly, the temperature T2 will typically depend on the specific second metal carbonyl and/or<br>
the sacrificial non-metal material, and it is generally preferred that all temperatures are suitable<br>
at which at least a portion of the second metal will plate onto the sacrificial material. For<br>
example, where the feed gas comprises nickel carbonyl and iron carbonyl, and where the<br>
sacrificial material is graphite, the feed gas may be heated to temperature of between 150 Â°C to<br>
170 Â°C before entering the first section, and the feed gas leaving the first section may be heated<br>
to a temperature is between 180 Â°C to 200 Â°C before entering the second section. Thus, selective<br>
plating in separate compartments may be achieved. However, it should also be recognized that<br>
two or more metals may plated in a single section where desired (which will typically take place<br>
at the higher plating temperature for the metal carbonyls). Regardless of the place and/or<br>
sequence of plating, it is generally preferred that the temperature will be below a temperature<br>
that leads to undesired effects on the feed gas (e.g., carbon deposition from the feed gas at<br>
temperatures above 200 Â°C).<br>
It should still further be recognized that while contemplated configurations and processes<br>
are particularly advantageous for plants in which a turbine receives a metal carbonyl containing<br>
feed gas, that numerous alternative configurations and processes are also contemplated. Suitable<br>
alternative configurations and processes include all configurations and processes in which a<br>
metal carbonyl containing gas contacts a surface under conditions that enable at least partial<br>
plating of the metal carbonyl onto the surface, and wherein plating of the metal carbonyl is<br>
generally considered undesirable, or even detrimental to the surface.<br>
For example, numerous synthetic processes (e.g., ammonia synthesis, synthesis of single<br>
or mixed alcohols, or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons and hydrogen production)<br>
include metal containing catalysts, which can be poisoned by plating of a metal from a metal<br>
carbonyl. Other suitable processes may include mole sieves that may be contaminated by the<br>
metal carbonyls (e g., mol sieves of a pressure swing adsorption unit). Therefore, it is<br>
contemplated that alternative surfaces include synthesis catalysts, and vessels containing such<br>
catalysts. Furthermore, it is contemplated that pipelines, vessels, valves, and other components<br>
conveying feed gas containing a metal carbonyl can be protected using adsorbers according to<br>
the inventive subject matter. In a still further preferred aspect, it is contemplated that<br>
configurations and methods according to the inventive subject matter may also be employed to<br>
remove or at least reduce the concentration of metal carbonyls from a gas that is vented into an<br>
environment (e.g., plant or atmosphere) to protect the environment.<br>
Therefore, contemplated plants may also include an adsorber comprising a sacrificial<br>
non-metallic material onto which a metal is plated from a metal carbonyl contained in a feed gas<br>
at a temperature sufficient to plate the metal onto the non-metallic material. Consequently, a<br>
method of reducing a metal carbonyl concentration in a feed gas will include one step in which a<br>
feed gas is provided that includes a metal carbonyl. In another step, the feed gas is contacted in<br>
an adsorber with a sacrificial non-metallic material at a temperature sufficient to plate a metal<br>
from the metal carbonyl onto the sacrificial non-metallic material,<br>
Thus, specific embodiments and applications of improved configurations and processes<br>
for carbonyl removal have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those skilled in the<br>
art that many more modifications besides those already described are possible without departing<br>
from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted<br>
except in the spirit of the appended claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and<br>
the claims, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the<br>
context. In particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising" should be interpreted as referring<br>
to elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced<br>
elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements,<br>
components, or steps that are not expressly referenced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A method of reducing a metal carbonyl concentration in a feed gas, comprising:<br>
providing a feed gas that includes a metal carbonyl;<br>
contacting the feed gas in an adsorber with a sacrificial non-metallic material comprising graphite at a temperature sufficient to plate a metal from the metal carbonyl onto the sacrificial non-metallic material; and<br>
using the feed gas in a downstream device.<br>
2.	The method of claim 1, wherein the feed gas comprises of a synthesis gas produced from gasification of a material selected from the group consisting of petroleum coke, visbreaker bottoms, asphaltenes, and vacuum bottoms.<br>
3.	The method of claim 1, wherein the metal carbonyl is selected from the group consisting of nickel carbonyl, iron carbonyl, and cobalt carbonyl.<br>
4.	The method of claim 1, wherein the temperature to plate the metal onto the non-metallic material is in the range of 150 Â°C to 200 Â°C.<br>
5.	The method of claim 1, wherein the downstream device is a gas turbine, a synthesis unit,or a pressure swing adsorption unit.<br>
6.	The method of claim 5, wherein the gas turbine is a gas turbine of an integrated gasification combined cycle plant<br>
7.        The method of claim 1, optionally comprising a step of heating the feed gas using an aluminium-containing surface of a heat exchanger or using a gas turbine feed gas preheater.<br><br><br><br></td>
