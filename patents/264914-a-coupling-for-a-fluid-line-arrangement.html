				<td>Coupling for a fluid line arrangement<br>
The invention concerns a coupling for a fluid line arrangement according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Such a coupling for a fluid line arrangement is known from US-A-4,147,368. The prior coupling comprises a coupling part provided with a sealing unit that is in the form of a sealing ring and by means of which the coupling part and an insert part that can be fitted into the coupling part can be sealed against each other! The sealing ring is disposed in a circumferential, recessed receiving groove provided in the inner wall of the coupling part, has a radially outwardly disposed, planar outer side that contacts a planar support surface of the receiving groove, and is configured with a radially inwardly oriented, arcuate inner side, edge faces oriented at right angles to the outer side being configured between the outer side and the inner side.<br>
US-A-3,584,889 and US-A-3,368,830 each disclose a coupling for a fluid line arrangement, in which a coupling part in the form of a sleeve extending between two line ends of the fluid line arrangement is configured endwise with rectangular sealing-ring receptacles formed by radially broadening the sleeve. In US-A-3,584,889, a sealing ring having a radially outwardly disposed, planar outer side and an inwardly oriented, arcuate inner side is fitted into each of the sealing-ring receptacles, edge faces oriented at right angles to the outer side and comprising axially projecting elevations being configured between the outer side and the inner side. In US-A-3,368,830, a sealing ring having a radially outwardly disposed, planar outer side and an inwardly oriented inner side is fitted into each of the sealing-ring receptacles, the inner side being provided with a number of flexible ribs that are deformable and fit themselves to the line ends of the fluid line arrangement.<br>
Known from DE 200 16 118 U1 is a fluid line arrangement with a complexly configured seal exhibiting various curvatures, grooves and flat sides.<br>
Known from DE 299 03 469 01 is a fluid line arrangement with annular seals configured... hooks.1<br>
Known from US-A-3,891,224 is a D-shaped seal for a manhole composed of ring segments, which seal has a radially outwardly disposed, planar outer side and a radially inwardly oriented, arcuate inner side, with edge faces oriented at right angles to the outer side extending between the outer side and the inner side. The seal is configured with an inner cavity and contacts, by an edge face, an abutment step configured in a ring segment.<br>
Known from US-A-3,081,102 is a fluid line arrangement comprising a seal having dome-like and finger-like elevations.<br>
Known from DE 101 15 399 C1 is a coupling that is to be integrated into a fluid line arrangement and comprises a coupling part provided with a sealing unit having at least one sealing ring. The sealing unit of the prior coupling comprises two sealing rings of round cross section and an intermediate ring disposed between the sealing rings, and is intended to seal against each other the coupling part and an insert part that can be fitted into the coupling part.<br>
The object underlying the invention is to specify a coupling for a fluid line arrangement of the initially cited kind, which is configured as comparatively small in cross section and in which the or each sealing ring is reliably secured against twisting and dropout.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention, in a coupling for a fluid line arrangement of the aforesaid kind, by means of the characterizing features of Claim 1.<br>
By virtue of the fact that the sealing unit is provided with a retaining collar having oblique walls and projecting beyond the planar support surface; a step with a contact surface; and a sealing ring that is disposed in back of the retaining collar in the insertion direction of the insert part and that has, visually speaking, a D shape in which the outer side and the inner side merge directly into each other, despite the slender construction of the coupling, the or each sealing ring is secured against dropout and the twisting rigidity of the particular sealing ring is appreciably increased compared to a roundish cross section, thereby appreciably reducing the risk that it will twist portionally on itself.<br>
Further useful configurations of the invention are the subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
Further useful configurations and advantages will emerge from the following description of a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, taken with reference to the figures of the drawing. Therein:<br><br>
Fig. 1   is a partially cut-away side view of an exemplary embodiment of a coupling according to the invention, comprising a sealing unit equipped with a single D-shaped sealing ring, and<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 in the region of the sealing ring, with an insert part fitted into the coupling part.<br>
Figure 1 is a partially cut-away side view of an exemplary embodiment of a coupling according to the invention. The illustrated coupling according to the invention comprises a coupling part 1, which is fitted with an adapter 2 for connection to, for example, a hose of a fluid line arrangement not shown in Fig. 1. The coupling part 1 is also provided with a receiving portion 3, which is larger in circumference than the adapter 2 and in this exemplary embodiment includes a receptacle for a locking clamp 4, by means of which an insert part not shown in Fig. 1... after being fitted into...<br>
can be<br>
locked against accidentally slipping out of receiving portion 3 after being fitted into receiving portion 3 from an insertion side 5 of coupling part 1 that is disposed oppositely from adapter 2 in an insertion direction pointing from insertion side 5 toward adapter 2. In this way, the insert part is disposed operationally reliably in a substantially cylindrical receiving space 6 that is surrounded by receiving portion 3.<br>
The coupling according to the invention further comprises a sealing unit, which in the illustrated exemplary embodiment is formed by an annularly closed sealing ring 7. The sealing ring 7 is configured in the illustrated exemplary embodiment with a planar outer side 8 that in the intended arrangement faces outward, and has an arcuate inner side 9 that extends between the edge faces of planar side 8 and is oriented radially inward. In the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment, the sealing ring 7 has a substantially semicircular cross section and, in stretched-out arrangement, a semicylindrical shape, the planar outer side 8 being disposed in the plane of symmetry if the cross section were complemented to form a full circle or a full cylinder.<br>
In other useful configurations not depicted here, the arcuate inner side 9 of sealing ring 7 forms a partial circumference of a circle spanning an angular range of less than or more than 180 degrees, such that planar outer side 8 is outside the center of the corresponding full circle.<br>
In other useful configurations, arcuate inner side 9 has an elliptical outer surface and planar outer side 8 either is disposed in one of the two planes of symmetry of the ellipse, for a symmetrical configuration of the sealing ring 7, or is offset in parallel to one of said planes should an asymmetrical configuration be useful.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 in the region of sealing ring 7. As is clearly discernible from Fig. 2, the radially outward lying, planar outer side 8 of sealing ring 7 contacts an also planarly configured support surface 10 of coupling part 1, resulting in very good sealing action even in the presence of very weak radially outwardly acting forces, due to the large area of contact between outer side 8 and support surface 10. Formed adjacently to support surface 10 is a rear contact surface 11 of a step 12 that projects axially against the insertion direction, while a play compensating space 15 is present between a radially inwardly directed sealing wall 13 and an abutment wall 14 that is part of coupling part 1 and extends substantially in the radial direction.<br>
It is also clear from the representation according to Fig. 2 that configured on the edge region of planar support surface 11 that is in front in the insertion direction is a radially inwardly projecting retaining collar 16 having a front wall 17 located in front in the insertion direction and a rear wall 18 positioned in back in the insertion direction. Retaining collar 16 secures sealing ring 7 against accidentally slipping out of coupling part 1, rear wall 18 usefully having a smaller inclination than front wall 17 so that deformation can occur without damage.<br>
Also depicted in Fig. 2 is an insert part 19, which, analogously to coupling part 1, can be connected for example to a hose of a fluid line arrangement, also not shown in Fig. 2, to create a fluid connection to the hose connected to coupling part 1. In Fig. 2, insert part 19 is depicted in the intended arrangement for creating the fluid connection, in which an end portion 20 of insert part 19 that is in front in the insertion direction comes into contact by its radial outer side with the substantially radially inwardly oriented portions of arcuate outer side 9 and slightly deforms sealing ring 7, while a wall region of arcuate inner side 9 that is in back in the insertion direction rests against contact surface 11 to bring about sealing action in the region of end portion 20. Taken all together, this gives the inventive coupling a comparatively high ability to accommodate production tolerances in the radial direction.<br>
It can further be appreciated from Fig. 2 that when insert part 19 is arranged as intended between the front face, i.e., that located in front in the insertion direction, of end portion 12 of insert part 19 and the abutment wall 14 of coupling part 1, a greater tolerance range is also provided in the axial direction, by compensating space 15.<br><br><br><br><br>
