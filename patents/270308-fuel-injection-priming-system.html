				<td>DIESEL FUEL INJECTION PRIMING SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/975,997, filed on September 28, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to fuel injection systems and more<br>
particularly, to a diesel fuel injection priming system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Diesel engines commonly employ a piezoelectric fuel injection<br>
system for injecting fuel into the engine. When the diesel engine piezoelectric fuel<br>
injection system is run out of fuel, vapor can be trapped in the fuel injectors. This<br>
vapor can inhibit operation of the injectors that can prevent the engine from re-<br>
starting after normal priming of the fuel system with fuel.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A fuel injection priming system includes a fuel supply line<br>
connected to a fuel supply rail. A plurality of piezoelectric fuel injectors are<br>
connected to the fuel supply rail. An injector return fuel line is connected to the fuel<br>
injectors and in communication with a pressurized fuel line via a diverter valve and<br>
return fuel restriction device to allow fuel from the pressurized fuel line to pressurize<br>
the injector return fuel line and backfill the injectors during a priming operation.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0008] The Figure shows a schematic view of a diesel engine system<br>
having a fuel injection priming system according to the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0010] With reference to the attached Figure, the diesel engine system 10<br>
having a fuel injection priming system, according to the principles of the present<br><br>
disclosure, will now be described. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
having an engine block defining a plurality of cylinders 14 and a plurality of pistons<br>
16 disposed in respective ones of said plurality of cylinders 14.<br>
[0011] A fuel supply system is provided for supplying fuel to each of the<br>
cylinders 14 of the engine 12. The fuel supply system includes a fuel tank 20 in<br>
communication with a fuel pump 22 that supplies fuel through a fuel supply line 24 to<br>
a fuel rail 26. The fuel rail 26 is connected to a plurality of fuel injectors 28 each<br>
corresponding with a respective one of the plurality of cylinders 14. A return fuel line<br>
30 is in communication with the fuel supply rail 26 and with fuel tank 20. A<br>
controllable pressure relief valve 31 can be provided in the return fuel line 30 to<br>
direct fuel from the fuel rail 26 back to the fuel tank 20 via the return fuel line 30. An<br>
injector return fuel line 32 is connected to the injectors 28 and is in communication<br>
with fuel tank 20 via a pressure regulating valve 36, a diverter valve 38 and a return<br>
fuel restriction device 40. The pressure regulating valve 36 is provided in<br>
communication with the injector return fuel line 32 and regulates/maintains the<br>
pressure of fuel supplied to the injectors 28. The diverter valve 38 can be an<br>
electrical or mechanical valve that can be controlled to provide pressurized fuel to<br>
the injectors 28 from the high pressure fuel pump return line 39 during a priming<br>
operation.<br>
[0012] The return fuel restriction device 40 is provided in communication<br>
with the diverter valve 38 to restrict flow to the fuel tank 20 sufficiently to allow fuel<br>
from the high pressure fuel pump return line 39 to backfill the injectors 28, thus<br>
eliminating the vapor that can become trapped after fuel run out.<br><br>
[0013] The fuel injectors 28 can be piezoelectric fuel injectors. When the<br>
diesel engine piezoelectric fuel injection system has run out of fuel, vapor can<br>
become trapped in the fuel injectors 28. This vapor prevents the engine 12 from re-<br>
starting after normal priming of the fuel system with fuel. The injectors 28 may not<br>
work properly when filled with an un-pressurized vapor/fuel mixture. By pressurizing<br>
the injector return fuel line 32 via the diverter valve 38 with restricted by-pass 40,<br>
adequate priming of the piezoelectric injectors is provided to enable engine re-start.<br>
The priming system provides adequate return fuel pressure to allow the piezoelectric<br>
injectors to function as needed for engine re-start by allowing the pressure supplied<br>
via the diverter valve 38 with restricted by-pass 40 to provide sufficient pressure to<br>
backfill the injector return fuel lines 32, to enable engine re-start.<br><br>
