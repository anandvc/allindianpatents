'Preamble to the Description<br>
The invention is directed to the dermatological product and a process for manufacturing the dermatological product, in general and as such this invention is in the field of pharmaceutical industry. This invention pertains further to introduction of Zinc as one component in the manufacture of Dermatological product for protecting human skin.<br>
It is well known in the art that Zinc containing compounds are of great benefit to humans. Some of them are well known antimicrobials. Zinc is an essential component of several metalloenzymes and is an essential nutrient and constituent of all biological systems. Currently Zinc is known to be required by approximately 200 metalloenzymes in the human body. Zinc concentrations tend to be higher in the skin and in human skin six times more Zinc is found in the superficial / top skin layer.<br>
The importance of Zinc in the growth and maintenance of the functional integrity of the skin is unequivocal. Response of the top layer of the skin to Zinc is indicated by skin growth, return of skin colour and prevention of hair falling due to ageing. The path physiological role of Zinc in human being has been proved through animal studies which proves the effect of Zinc in the treatment of lesion, varicose ulcer and other forms of injuries and in the repair of skin.<br>
In view of extensive studies in the utilization of Zinc in dermatological composition for protection of human skin, research and development has been exclusively focused on the use of Zinc in this area of interest. Considerable clinical interest and commercial value has been attached to the premise that Zinc accelerates the healing of wounds clearly. If Zinc is beneficial to wound healing in the skin one would expect it to promote cell proliferation, migration and differentiation in regenerating tissues because of its antibacterial and non allergic properties. As an accepted practice Zinc is used in many of the world's finest cosmetic products.<br><br>
-1<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THIS INVENTION<br>
&gt;	A general objective of this invention is to provide a new product of corticosteroid with Zinc Sulphate that provides the desired therapeutic response through topical administration in the form of cream.<br>
&gt;	The invention relates to a dermatological product, which provides usage for bacterial infection, fungal infection, and anti-inflammatory and dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, wound healing and eczema.<br>
&gt;	This dermatological product is unique in that it contains Zinc as an active ingredient.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The various benefits of the topical zinc is enumerated as under:<br>
Topical Zinc augments cutaneous immune response.<br>
Topical Zinc heals genital lesions.<br>
Topical Zinc is a mitotic agent for epidermal cells.<br>
Topical Zinc tackles higher levels of skin infections also.<br>
Topical Zinc is a photo protector.<br>
Topical Zinc treats acne vulgaris.<br>
Topical Zinc protects herpes simplex.<br>
Topical Zinc is a painless debriding agent.<br>
Topical Zinc exhibits enhanced percutaneous absorption and cutaneous bioavailability.<br>
Topical Zinc helps in isochoric dermatitis.<br>
Topical Zinc accelerates wound healing.<br>
Topical Zinc exhibits better aqueous solubility.<br>
Topical Zinc increases skin permeability.<br>
Topical Zinc is useful in the treatment of folliculate reticulate, pappilomatosis and<br>
psoriasis.<br>
Topical Zinc resolves erosive diaper rash.<br>
Thus Zinc unquestionably is superior and effective for topical therapy.<br><br>
UNIQUENESS OF THIS DERMATOLOGICAL PRODUCT<br>
The existing skin ointments / creams available in the market contain STEROIDS / ANTIBACTERIAL Drugs / ANTI FUNGAL Drugs either alone or in a combination but not with Zinc Sulphate.<br>
Till this date there is no dermatological preparation in nature as this invented Dermatological product which provides all the benefits of steroid, anti bacterial and anti¬fungal drugs along with the excellent benefits of Zinc as mentioned earlier. This is the salient feature of this invention.<br>
As such Dermatological product is a unique combination of its kind. RATIONALE OF ZINC IN DERMATOLOGICAL PRODUCT<br>
Dermatological conditions are often caused by allergy accompanied by inflammation, irritation and itching. They are further complicated by either bacterial infection or fungal infection or both. Any dermatological drug combination should be able to control allergy, inflammation and also bacterial or fungal infection and wound healing. It is therefore evident that the invented Dermatological product is versatile in its scope and application.<br>
The dermatological product consists of the following ingredients:-<br>
1.	Clobetasol Propionate:<br>
A powerful steroid used in dermatological conditions to prevent allergy and control infl£immation and itching.<br>
2.	Gentamicin: Antibiotic to control bacterial infections of skin.<br>
3.	Miconazole<br><br>
Miconazole is a drug for the treatment of fungal complications of the skin.<br>
4.	Zinc is used to assist in rapid wound healing and to provide all its benefits in<br>
dermatological conditions.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to invent a novel dermatological product namely ZINCODERM-GM<br>
' It is another objective of the invention to invent a novel dermatological product using Zinc as one of the ingredients.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a safe and useful drug for combating skin diseases.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description:-<br>
