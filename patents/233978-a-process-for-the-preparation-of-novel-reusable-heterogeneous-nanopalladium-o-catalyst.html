				<td>The present invention relates to A process for the preparation of a reusable heterogeneous nanopalladium(O) catalyst. The catalyst on the solid support perform C-C bond formation reactions such as Heck, Suzuki, Sonagashira, and Stille type reactions of haloarenes that include unreactive chloroarenes. Layered double hydroxides and Merrifield resin supported nanopalladium catalysts are prepared by an exchange of PdC142-  followed by reduction and well characterized for the first time.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an eco-friendly process employing re-usable heterogeneous catalyst in place of soluble palladium catalysts for preparing coupling products by C-C bond formation reaction of haloarenes that include unreactive chloroarenes in the presence of base. The ligand free heterogeneous layered double hydroxides supported nanopalladium (LDH-Pd°) catalyst using the basic LDH in place of basic ligands indeed exhibits higher activity and selectivity in the C-C coupling reactions of haloarenes that include electron poor and electron rich chloroarenes in nonaqueous ionic liquids (NAIL) over the homogeneous PdC12 system. The coupling products find good applications as intermediates in the preparation of materials, natural products, and bioactive compounds.<br>
There are serious disadvantages in performing the catalytic C-C bond formation reaction with iodoarenes and bromoarenes in the manufacture of olefins due to high cost of the starting materials. Despite the synthetic elegance and high turnover number, these coupling reactions suffer from serious limitations of using the expensive bromo and iodoarenes that precluded the wide use in industry.    By employing the heterogeneous<br><br>
catalytic system and chloroarenes as starting materials, the cost naturally comes down<br>
due to easy recovery of the catalyst and low cost of chloroarenes when compared with<br>
bromo and iodoarenes.<br>

Sonogashira- and Stille type coupling of haloarenes that include chloroarenes in presence<br>
of base.<br>
Heterogeneous nano^alladium(O) catalysts are prepared by an exchange of PdCU2"<br>
followed by reduction on silica or resin or LDH .<br>
The nanopalladium (0) on supports is responsible for the activity of catalyst in<br>
C-C coupling reactions. The activity of heterogeneous nanopalladium catalysts is similar<br>
or higher than the homogeneous counter parts. The basic support, Mg-Al layered double<br>
hydroxides (LDH) is selected as the material of choice, which not only stabilizes the<br>
nanopalladium particles but also provides the adequate electron density to the anchored<br>
Pd° species to facilitate oxidative addition of even the deactivated electron rich<br>
chloroarenes.<br>
Higher yields and stereoselectivities are obtained when nanopalladium catalysts<br>
are used. Incidentally this forms the first report of heterogeneous palladium catalyst<br>
employed in the Stille type coupling. The consistent activity obtained for several cycles<br>
makes the process economical and possible for commercial realization.<br>
The coupling products find good applications as intermediates in the preparation<br>
of materials, natural products, and bioactive compounds. Thus this invention offers the<br>
best techno-economic route for the synthesis of coupling products. Therefore,<br>
nanopalladium catalysts are better option for the C-C bond formation reaction of<br>
haloarenes that include chloroarenes.<br>
Nanopalladium catalysts are prepared as exemplified and used in catalytic<br>
amounts for preparing coupling products by C-C bond formation reaction in presence of<br>
base in a heterogeneous way as described in the examples.<br>

Heck-Olefination between chlorobenzene and styrene catalysed by LDH-Pd° under<br>
thermal conditions<br>
In a 100 mL Schlenk flask, the NAIL (3.23 g, 10 mmol) was heated to melt<br>
(130°C) and degassed with nitrogen and vacuum prior to the addition of other reagents.<br>
After cooling the NAIL to room temperature, LDH-Pd° (3 mol%), tri-n-butyl amine<br>
(222mg, 1.2 mmol) were added. The styrene (1.2 mmol) and chlorobenzene (1 mmol)<br>
were then added and the reaction was heated to 130°C and stirred for 10-40 h under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of the reaction, the LDH-Pd° catalyst was filtered<br>
and washed with water and dichloromethane. After removing the solvent, the crude<br>
material was chromatographed on silica gel or recrystallized from ethanol to afford the<br>
/ra/w-stilbene.<br>
Examples 10-17<br>
The procedure was followed as in example 9 with various substrates under<br>

Styrene (1.2 mmol), chlorobenzene (1 mmol), LDH-Pd° (3 mol%), tri-n-butyl<br>

closed and irradiated in a Miele Electronic M270 microwave oven at 400W and 130°C<br>
for 0.5-1 h. After completion of the reaction, the LDH-Pd° catalyst was filtered and<br>
washed with water and dichloromethane. After removing the solvent, the crude material<br>
was chromatographed on silica gel to afford the /rans-stilbene.<br>

Examples 27-32<br>
In an effort to compare the reactivity of LDH-Pd° with other heterogeneous<br>
catalysts namely Pd/C, Pd/SiOi, resin-Pd0 and Pd/AhOs in the Heck-olefination, separate<br>
experiments were conducted under identical conditions with the same ingredients and the<br>
results are summarized in Table 3. The activity of various catalysts in the Heckolefination<br>
of 4-chloroanisole is found to be in the order: LDH-Pd°&gt;resin-<br>
Pd°&gt;Pd/C&gt;Pd/Al2O3&gt;Pd/SiO2. These results indicate that the basic support, LDH<br>
facilitates the oxidative addition of Pd° with 4-chloroanisole and eventually the Heckolefination<br>
reaction.<br>
The procedure was followed as in example 9 with various catalysts between 4-<br>
chloroanisole and styrene under thennal conditions and the results are presented in Table<br>

Example 33<br>
Suzuki coupling between chlorobenzene and phenylboronic acid catalysed by LDHPd°<br>
Chlorobenzene (1 mmol), phenylboronic acid (1.5 mmol), potassium fluoride (3<br>
mmol), LDH-Pd° (1 mol%) and 1,4-dioxane-water (5:1,5 mL) were charged in a roundbottomed<br>
flask. Reactions were carried out at 100°C for 10 h. After completion of the<br>
reaction (monitored by TLC), the catalyst was filtered and the reaction mixture was<br>
poured into water and the aqueous phase was extracted with ether. After drying, the<br>
corresponding product was purified by crystallization from diethyl ether-pentane.<br>
Examples 34-40<br>
The procedure was followed as in example 33 and the results are given in Table 4.<br>

To a stirred slurry of chlorobenzene (1 mmol), cuprous iodide (7.6mg, 0.04<br>
mmol), and LDH-Pd° (1 mol%), in THF (2 mL) and water (4 mL) was added<br>
triethylamine (152 mg, 1.5 mmol). A solution of 1.25 mmol of phenylacetylene in THF<br>
(2 mL) was then added over 2 h. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was<br>
evaporated, and the residue was treated with pentane. The solution was filtered to obtain<br>
the catalyst and evaporation of the solvent gives the coupling product.<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. A novel and ecofriendly process for the synthesis of coupling products from<br>
haloarenes that include highly unreactive chloroarenes by C-C bond formation is<br>
presented.<br>
2. The present process dispenses the use of soluble palladium catalysts instead a<br>
heterogeneous reusable LDH-Pd(O) is used.<br>
3. Nanopalladium catalyst, LDH-Pd(O) is prepared and used as heterogeneous catalyst for<br>
the synthesis of coupling products by C-C bond formation reactions. The use of<br>
heterogeneous nanopalladium catalyst precludes the presence of palladium in traces<br>
with the product.<br>
4. The stereoselectivity and the yields are good.<br>
5. The work-up procedure is simple.<br>
6. The catalyst is subjected to many recycles, which displayed consistent activity.<br>
7. The present process is environmentally safe since there is no disposal problem.<br>
8. The process is economical.<br><br><br>
