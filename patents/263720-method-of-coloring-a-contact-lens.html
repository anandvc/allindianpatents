METHOD OF COLORING A CONTACT LENS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to colored contact lenses and<br>
methods of making colored contact lenses.<br>
(2)	General Background<br>
Pad printed processes are often utilized to mass produce<br>
colored cosmetic corrective and non-corrective contact lenses.<br>
Pad-printing generally comprises the use of printing plates or<br>
clichés that have one or more depressions that collectively form<br>
a pattern that is transferable to a contact lens.  During a pad-<br>
printing process, the fluent colorant is introduced into the<br>
depressions of the cliche.  After the fluent colorant is<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT7US2006/000974<br>
introduced into the depressions of the cliché, a doctor blade or<br>
an ink cup is then wiped across the surface of the cliché<br>
surrounding the depression(s) to remove excess ink from the<br>
cliché. A printing pad is then pressed against the cliché to<br>
transfer at least some of the colorant from the depressions to<br>
the printing pad.  Finally, the printing pad is pressed against<br>
the contact lens to transfer the colorant from the printing pad<br>
to the contact lens.<br>
A disadvantage of using pad-printing techniques is that the<br>
clichés wear as a result of the wiping process and generally<br>
must be replaced after approximately one-hundred thousand<br>
cycles, thereafter being no longer suitable for use.  In<br>
addition to costs associated with forming new clichés, the<br>
replacement process requires halting production, dismounting the<br>
worn cliché or cliché set, and then mounting and aligning new<br>
cliché (s). Aligning new clichés is often time consuming and<br>
tedious.  When printing detailed image patterns comprising<br>
multiple layers of individual colorants, each new cliché for a<br>
particular colorant layer must not only be properly aligned to<br>
the contact lenses, but also to each of the other clichés. As a<br>
result, numerous iterations of resuming then halting the lens<br>
production line to verify the cliché alignment accuracy are<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
often required. As images for coloring contact lenses become<br>
more intricate with higher resolutions and increasing numbers of<br>
color layers, the difficulty of aligning clichés and the time<br>
spent to do so increases.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The pad-printing methods of the present invention are an<br>
improvement over prior art pad-printing methods of coloring<br>
contact lenses.  In general, the present invention increases the<br>
useful life of clichés and improves the image resolution<br>
achievable using printing pad techniques.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, a method comprises a<br>
step of forming a cliché.  The cliché comprises a piece of<br>
material having at least one depression formed therein using an<br>
electrical discharge machining process.  This method also<br>
comprises a step of introducing a fluent colorant into the<br>
depression of the cliché.  Still further, this method comprises<br>
a step of transferring at least some of the colorant from the<br>
depression to a contact lens.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, a method comprises a<br>
step of forming a cliché.  The cliché comprises a piece of<br>
material having a hardness rating in excess of Rockwell 64<br>
(measured on the "C" Scale).  The cliche also comprises a<br>
-3 -<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
depression formed into the piece of material.  The method also<br>
comprises a step of introducing a fluent colorant into the<br>
depression of the cliché.  Furthermore, the method comprises a<br>
step of transferring at least some of the colorant from the<br>
depression to a contact lens.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a method comprises a<br>
step of providing a cliché.  The cliche comprises a piece of<br>
material having a flat surface portion and a depression.  The<br>
flat surface portion defines a plane and the depression extends<br>
through the plane and into the piece of material a maximum depth<br>
perpendicular to and beyond the plane.  The method further<br>
comprises a step of introducing a fluent colorant into the<br>
depression of the cliché.  Additionally, the method comprises a<br>
step of wiping excess fluent colorant from the flat surface<br>
portion surrounding the depression, the wiping causing the piece<br>
of material to wear in a manner such that the maximum depth of<br>
the depression is reduced.  Still further, the method comprises<br>
a step of transferring at least some of the colorant from the<br>
depression to a contact lens.  The steps of introducing a fluent<br>
colorant into the depression of the cliché, wiping excess fluent<br>
colorant from the flat surface portion surrounding the<br>
depression, and transferring at least some of the colorant from<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
the depression to a contact lens occur in a manner such that<br>
these steps could be repeated in excess of one million times<br>
without the maximum depth of the depression being reduced by<br>
more than five micrometers.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a method comprises<br>
a step of forming a cliché.  The cliche comprises a piece of<br>
cemented carbide material having at least one depression formed<br>
thereinto.  The method further comprises steps of introducing a<br>
fluent colorant into the depression of the cliché, and<br>
transferring at least some of the colorant from the depression<br>
to a contact lens.<br>
While the principal advantages and features of the<br>
invention have been described above, a more complete and<br>
thorough understanding of the invention may be obtained by<br>
referring to the drawings and the detailed description of the<br>
preferred embodiment, which follow.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the<br>
Invention<br>
An example of an iris simulating image for use in coloring<br>
contact lenses via a pad-printing process is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The iris simulating image 20 comprises the plurality of<br>
individual colorant layers shown in Figures 2a through 2d.<br>
Using a pad-printing process, the individual colorant layers are<br>
each separately applied to a contact lens.<br>
The process of printing a colorant layer on a contact lens<br>
using a pad-printing process is schematically shown in Figures<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
3a through 3e. As depicted in Figure 3a, a cliché 3 0 having a<br>
flat surface 32 is flooded with a fluent colorant 34.  The<br>
cliche 30 has at least one depression 36 that extends into the<br>
material forming the cliché through the flat surface 32.  The<br>
depression 30 or set of depressions is configured such that when<br>
viewed from directly above the flat surface 32, the depression<br>
or set of depressions create a pattern identical to the<br>
particular colorant layer sought to be applied to a contact lens<br>
(i.e., a pattern such as shown in Figures 2a through 2d).  A<br>
doctor blade 38, or in some cases a portion of an ink cup, is<br>
engaged with and swept across the flat surface 32 of the cliché<br>
30 to wipe excess fluent colorant 34 from the portion of the<br>
flat surface surrounding the depression(s) 36, leaving fluent<br>
colorant in the depression(s).  Following these steps and as<br>
shown in Figure 3b, a conventional pad-printing pad 40 is then<br>
vertically aligned with the depression 36 and pressed downward<br>
against the cliché 30 to transfer at least some of the fluent<br>
colorant 34 in the depression(s) to the pad.  The pad 40 is<br>
thereafter brought into registration (Figure 3c) with a contact<br>
lens substrate 42 held on a lens holder 44 and then pressed<br>
(Figure 3d) against the lens substrate to deposit the colorant<br>
on the substrate.  When the pad 40 is raised from the contact<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
lens substrate 42, at least some of the colorant layer 46<br>
remains on the substrate in the desired pattern for the<br>
particular colorant layer, and is allowed to dry.  Although not<br>
shown, additional colorant layers are thereafter serially<br>
printed on the lens substrate 42 by transferring fluent colorant<br>
from other clichés (or other portions of the same cliche) that<br>
have distinct patterns or arrangement of depressions.<br>
Preferably, different fluent colorants are used for each<br>
distinct pattern.  Once transferred to the contact lens<br>
substrate 42, the individual colorant layers combine to form the<br>
complete iris-simulating image (such as shown in Figure 1).<br>
The number of colorant layers making up the overall image<br>
sought to be printed on contact lenses can vary, and in some<br>
cases may be only one.  However, the present invention is<br>
particularly advantageous when the image sought to be printed is<br>
an iris simulating image comprising multiple colorant layers.<br>
Typically the images sought to be printed on contact lenses<br>
are created or edited using computers.  For example, a computer<br>
having a processor such as an Intel Pentium-4 processor and that<br>
is equipped with a vector graphics design program such as Adobe<br>
Illustrator* is well suited for editing such images.  In<br>
situations where the image to be printed is an iris simulating<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
image, an initial digitized image pattern may be obtained by-<br>
scanning a photograph or rendering of a iris simulating pattern<br>
the computer, via a digital camera, or any other means of<br>
obtaining an digitized image of an iris pattern. Alternatively,<br>
the iris simulating patterns can be created from scratch using<br>
computer software.  When using a pad-printing process, several<br>
sub-images, each representing a separate colorant layer, may be<br>
generated.  Depressions are then formed into clichés to match<br>
the images or sub-images as described below.<br>
Unlike prior art techniques used to create clichés for<br>
pad-printing contact lenses, the present invention utilizes<br>
different materials and different methods of creating<br>
depressions in the clichés.  Preferably each cliché is formed<br>
from a piece of cemented cabide material.  As used herein,<br>
cemented carbide is meant to include Tungsten Carbide,<br>
Molybdenum Carbide, Tantalum Carbide, Rhenium Carbide,<br>
Columbium Carbide, Alumon Carbide, Barium.Carbide, Boron<br>
Carbide, Calcium Carbide, Cerium Carbide, Hafnium Carbide, Iron<br>
Carbide, Itrion Carbide, Lantion Carbide, Lition Carbide,<br>
Mangese Carbide, Molibion Carbide, Niobium Carbide, Neodymium<br>

Samarium Carbide, Sodium Carbide, Selenium Carbide, Silicon<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
Carbide, Tantalum Carbide, Torion Carbide, Titanium Carbide,<br>
Uranium Carbide, Vanadium Carbide, Zircon Carbide, and any other<br>
cemented carbide belonging to the class of hard, wear-resistant,<br>
refractory materials in which the hard carbide particles are<br>
bound together, or cemented, by a binder and binderless<br>
carbides such as CerbideTM, HardideTM, and any heterogeneous<br>
combination of metal(s) or alloy(s) with one or more ceramic<br>
phases in which the latter constitutes approximately fifteen to<br>
eighty-five percent by volume and in which there is relatively<br>
little solubility between metallic and ceramic phases at the<br>
preparation temperature.<br>
A perspective view of a portion of an exemplary cliché 30<br>
is shown in Figure 4.  The piece of cemented carbide material<br>
used to form the cliché 30 preferably comprises a flat surface<br>
32 having surface finish of six micro-inches centre line average<br>
(CLA).  Pieces of cemented carbide material meeting these<br>
specifications can be purchased through various cemented carbide<br>
material suppliers such as Philadelphia Carbide Company located<br>
in Oreland, Pennsylvania.  The piece of material used to create<br>
the cliche 30 is preferably plate material having overall<br>
dimensions similar to prior art pad-printing plates or clichés.<br>
Preferably a plurality of depressions 36 corresponding to<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
the image or image colorant layer sought to be reproduced using<br>
the cliché 30 are formed into the piece of material though the<br>
flat surface 32.  Unlike prior art techniques of forming<br>
depressions in clichés, the present invention preferably<br>
utilizes an electrical discharge machining (EDM) process to<br>
create the depressions 36.  This is preferably done by saving<br>
the desired image is a digitized format such as IGES (Initial<br>
Graphics Exchange Specification) format and exporting it to<br>
computer aided machining software (CAM software) (available<br>
through SmalTec International of Naperville, Illinois).<br>
Preferably, the CAM software, in turn, drives a CNC Controller<br>
and an electrical pulse controller used to run a wire electrical<br>
discharge grinding (WEDG) EDM device, such a Panasonic model MG-<br>
ED72W (also available through SmalTec International), to thereby<br>
form the depressions into the piece of material. Alteratively,<br>
a Die-Sinking EDM (also known as Sinker, Ram-Type, Conventional,<br>
Plunge or Vertical EDM) can be used to from the depressions into<br>
the piece of material.  When using a Die-Sinking EDM, a raised<br>
reciprocal pattern of the image is preferably formed on the<br>
electrode of the EDM machine using, known lasing processes.  For<br>
example, positive image or reciprocal relief of the depressions<br>
from a colorant layer can be etched into an electrode comprised<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
of a tungsten-copper alloy (such as is available through Saturn<br>
Industries of Hudson, New York) via a yttrium aluminum garnet<br>
(YAG) laser (such as an Electrox* Scriba II, commercially<br>
available from Electrox USA, Indianapolis, Indiana).  It should<br>
be appreciated that a cliché can comprises a single set of<br>
depressions forming a single color layer or that a cliché may<br>
comprise a plurality of sets of depressions, with each set<br>
forming a separate image pattern.<br>
Using the forgoing methods to create the depressions of a<br>
color contact pad-printing cliché, provides several advantages<br>
over prior art methods of forming depressions.  In particular,<br>
using a WEDG EDM process allows for the formation of very small<br>
and precise depressions that are not achievable using prior art<br>
techniques of forming color contact pad-printing clichés.  To<br>
illustrate this point, a detail perspective view depicting a<br>
pair of depression formed into the flat surface 32 of a cliché<br>
30 is shown in Figure 4. A first depression 50 is shown<br>
extending into the piece of material through the plane of the<br>
flat surface 32 of the cliché 30. The first depression 50<br>
extends into the material of the cliché 30 a constant depth 52<br>
perpendicular to and beyond the plane of the flat surface 32.<br>
The second depression 54 comprises a first portion 56 that<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
extends into the material of the cliché 30 a first depth 58<br>
perpendicular to and beyond the plane of the flat surface 32,<br>
and a second portion 60 that extends into the material of the<br>
cliché a second depth 62 perpendicular to and beyond the plane<br>
of the flat surface.<br>
For purposes of explaining resolution details of the<br>
depressions, it should be appreciated that a projected surface<br>
area can be determined for each of the first and second<br>
depressions 50, 54 by projecting the depressions perpendicularly<br>
onto the plane of the flat surface 32.  Using a EDM process to<br>
form the depressions allows very precise placement of the<br>
depressions.  For example, at least a portion of the projected<br>
surface area of the first depression 50 can be within 50<br>
micrometers, 25 micrometers, 10 micrometer, 5 micrometers, and<br>
even 2.5 micrometers of a portion of the second depression 54.<br>
This spacing is represented by the numeral 62 in Figure 4.<br>
Additionally, the projected surface areas of the depressions can<br>
be rather small.  For example, the projected surface area of an<br>
individual depression can be less than 6000 square micrometers,<br>
or if desired, less than 4000 square micrometers, 2000 square<br>
micrometers, 1000 square micrometers, or even 800 square<br>
micrometers.  Still further, using EDM processes to create the<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
depressions, the depth of any depression can vary by more than<br>
six micrometers from one portion to another portion of the<br>
depression. Although the variance in the depth of a depression<br>
is preferably gradual, the depth variance can also be abrupt.<br>
For example the first depth 58 of the first portion 56 of the<br>
second depression 54 shown in Figure 4 could be seven<br>
micrometers while the second depth 62 of its second portion 60<br>
may be in excess of twenty micrometers.<br>
By allowing high resolution depressions to be formed the<br>
cliches, very intricate patterns of depressions can be formed to<br>
collectively create a colorant layer of an image to be<br>
transferred to a contact lens. Additionally, by allowing the<br>
depth of depression to be varied and allowing the depths of<br>
separate depressions to be distinct, different thicknesses of a<br>
colorant can be simultaneously transferred to a contact lens<br>
using a pad-printing process.  In situation where the colorant<br>
is not fully opaque, this allows control over the shade of the<br>
color resulting from the colorant throughout different portions<br>
of the image.  Thus, using the methods described herein, a pad-<br>
printing process can achieve image resolutions and quality near<br>
those achievable via inject processes.<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/078520	PCT/US2006/000974<br>
By forming the clichés out of cemented carbide material,<br>
the hardness of the clichés is in excess of the industry<br>
standard Rockwell 62-64 ("C" Scale) steel currently employed in<br>
the art. Additionally, the wear resistance of clichés is nearly<br>
100 times greater than that of the material currently employed<br>
in the art. As discussed above, the wiping step of a pad-<br>
printing process invariably wears a cliché in a manner such that<br>
the depth of the depressions is gradually reduced.  By<br>
increasing the wear resistance of the clichés, such wear can be<br>
reduced to less than six micrometers per million pad-printing<br>
cycles.  Moreover, in some cases, the wear may be reduced to<br>
less than six micrometers per ten million cycles.  This allows<br>
clichés formed using methods of this invention to have a useful<br>
life many time greater than the useful life of clichés presently<br>
used in the art of coloring contact lenses.  By increasing the<br>
useful life of the clichés, the frequency of replacing the<br>
cliches can be reduced by a factor of more than one hundred.<br>
This greatly increases productivity and efficiency by reducing<br>
the undesirable downtime resulting from the alignment process<br>
each time the clichés are replaced.<br>
