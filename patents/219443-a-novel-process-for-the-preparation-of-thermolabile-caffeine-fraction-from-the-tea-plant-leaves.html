				<td>THERMOLABILE CAFFEINE FRACTION OF TEA LEAVES AND AN<br>
EFFICIENT METHOD OF INTRODUCING AGROBACTERIUMMEDIATED<br>
GENETIC TRANSFORMATION IN PLANTS<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a thermolabile caffeine fraction useful for an<br>
efficient Agrobacterium -mediated genetic transformation in plant systems to<br>
develop desired traits in plant, and a method of preparing said fraction from tea<br>
leaves and also, an efficient and cost-effective method of introducing said<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation into plant systems using said<br>
caffeine fraction of tea leaves.<br>
Background and prior art references of present invention<br>
Agrobacterium is a gram negative soil bacterium that transfers its Ti plasmid or the<br>
Tumor inducing plasmid1 into the cells of most dicotyledonous plants and quite a good<br>
number of monocotyledonous plants. The Ti plasmid undergoes cell-cell recognition,<br>
signal transduction, cellular and nuclear import and finally T-DNA integration (Winans<br>
SC Two-way chemical signaling in Agrobacterium-plant interactions Microbiological-<br>
Reviews. 1992,56: 1,12-31).<br>
The transfer DNA or the T-DNA harbouring the oncogenes bounded by the 25bp<br>
imperfect border repeats on either side brings about genetic transformation and hence<br>
crown gall disease. The process of signal transduction is initiated by a set of several<br>
Virulence genes', of which 7 genes are the most important.<br>
The first step of signal reception and then transduction is triggered by the inducers like<br>
phenolics and sugars (Ankenbauer RG; Nester EW Sugar-mediated induction of<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence genes: structural specificity and activities of<br>
monosaccharides. Journal of Bacteriology. 1990, 172: 11,6442-6446).<br>
For the past two decades, revolutionary work has been done on development of<br>
genetically transformed plants wherein, the disarmed strains of Agrobacterium (i. e. the<br>
Ti plasmid with the oncogenes replaced by penes of interest) are employed to produce<br>
plants as per ones requirements at a much t .. ner time. The inducers that are used for<br>
such genetic transformation experiments are generally the Acetosyringone (Morris JW;<br>
Morris RO Identification of an Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence gene inducer from<br>
the Pinaceous gymnosperm Pseudotsuga menziesii. Proceedings of the National<br>
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 1990, 87: 9, 3614-3618) and the<br>
Hydroxy-acetosyringone that are commercially provided by the Sigma Aldrich<br>
Company, USA.<br>
Tea leaves when extracted, are known to have fractions of caffeine, catechins and other<br>
flavonols and amino acids. Some chance experiments indicated that particular fractions<br>
of tea containing caffeine are capable of promoting infection by Agrobacterium, cellcell<br>
recognition and virulence. This led us to believe that the caffeine fractions can be<br>
used as a virulence inducer during genetic transformation experiments instead of<br>
Acetosyringone or Hydroxy-acetosyringone.<br>
Besides containing high levels of the 6 types of catechins (C) and their derivatives viz.,<br>
epicatechin (EC), gallocatechins (GC), epigallocatechins (EGC), epicatechin gallate<br>
(ECg), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), tea leaves also contain caffeine, amino acids,<br>
nitrogenous compounds, vitamins, inorganic elements, carbohydrates and lipids (Chu<br>
DC and Juneja L.R. General chemical composition of green tea and its infusion. In:<br>
Chemistry and Application of Green Tea. 1997. CRC Press, N. York. eds. Yamamoto<br>
T., Juneja L.R., Chu DC, Kim M., pp.).<br>
The report of Sunilkumar et a/., 1999. (Sunilkumar G; Vijayachandra K; Veluthambi K.<br>
1999, Pre-incubation of cut tobacco leaf explants promotes Agrobacterium-mediated<br>
transformation by increasing vir gene induction. Plant Science Limerick. 141: 1, 51-58)<br>
indicated that the requirement of preincubation for increased transformation efficiency<br>
can be obviated by the addition of 100 uM acetosyringone to the freshly cut leaf rings<br>
during the co-cultivation with Agrobacterium. The production of vir gene inducers by<br>
the leaf rings during the pre-incubation period is an important factor that contributes to<br>
increased transformation efficiency of Agrobacterium upon pre-incubation but the<br>
drawback is that the effect of the inducer 'acetosyringone1 and pre-incubation is similar<br>
and thus inducers do not have much role to play.<br>
Expression of Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence (vir) genes and transformation of<br>
dicots'by this organism are dependent upon host plant phenolic compounds and several<br>
alkylsyringamides, syringic acid, synthetic amides like ethylsyringamide, ferulic or<br>
sinapic acids are powerful inducers of vir genes (Vir gene inducing activities of<br>
hydroxycinnamic acid amides in Agrobacterium tumefaciens Berthelot, K; Buret, D;<br>
Guerin, B; Delay, D; Negrel, J; Delmotte, FM. Phytochemistry. 1998, 49: 6, 1537-<br>
1548).<br>
However, none of the inducers tested exhibited higher activity than acetosyringone, the<br>
reference compound for vir gene induction, with the exception to ethylsyringamide at<br>
concentrations above 1 mM. When tested on A. tumefaciens strain A348 (pSM243cd),<br>
ethylferulamide and ethylsinapamide are more efficient than the corresponding<br>
phenolic acids but only above 100<br>
The major draw back is that the above mentioned inducers are very expensive chemical<br>
compounds that are required to be used at high concentrations above 100 j^M.<br>
Moreover, the compounds like acetosyringone are manufactured only by a few select<br>
companies like Sigma Aldrich and requires import from United States of America by<br>
research laboratories situated in developing countries.<br>
Lee et al, 1995 (Lee, YongWoog; Jin, ShouGuang; Sim, WoongSeop; Nester, EW;<br>
Lee, YW; Jin, SG; Sim, WS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the<br>
United States of America. 1995 Genetic evidence for direct sensing of phenolic<br>
compounds by the VirA protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 92: 26, 12245-12249.)<br>
reported that the virulence (vir) genes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are induced by<br>
low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds and monosaccharides through a twocomponent<br>
regulatory system consisting of the VirA and VirG proteins. The virinducing<br>
abilities of 15 different phenolic compounds like acetovanillone was tested<br>
using four wild-type strains of A. tumefaciens KU12, C58, A6, and Bo542. By<br>
transferring different Ti plasmids into isogenic chromosomal backgrounds, the<br>
phenolic-sensing determinant was shown to be associated with Ti plasmid. Subcloning<br>
of Ti plasmid indicates that the vira locus determines which phenolic compounds can<br>
function as vir gene inducers. These results suggest that the VirA protein directly<br>
senses the phenolic compounds for vir gene activation. The drawback of this report is<br>
that subcloning of Ti plasmid is required for the identification of the accurate phenolics<br>
inducer for vir a locus.<br>
Hess et al., 1991 (Hess, KM; Dudley, MW; Lynn, DG; Joerger, RD; Binns, AN. 1991,<br>

specific inhibitor of bacterial sensor/response systems. Proceedings of the National<br>
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 1991, 88: 17, 7854-7858)<br>
reported that the aglycone of the dihydrodiconiferyl alcohol glycosides were potent<br>
inducers of virulence gene expression in A. tumefaciens. Using this model, a specific<br>
inhibitor of vir induction was developed. The drawback of this report is that this<br>
inhibitor did not affect the induction of other genes on the Ti plasmid but irreversibly<br>
blocks vir expression.<br>
Fortin et al., 1992 (Fortin, C; Nester, EW; Dion, P. 1992, Growth inhibition and loss of<br>
virulence in cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens treated with acetosyringone.<br>
Journal of Bacteriology. 174: 17, 5676-5685) reported that acetosyringone, a phenolic<br>
inducer of the virulence (vir) genes of A. tumefaciens, inhibited the growth of the<br>
nopaline type strains T37 and C58 incubated under acidic conditions. Two other vir<br>
inducers, sinapinic acid and syringaldehyde, also inhibited growth and promoted<br>
accumulation of avirulent clones in cultures of strains C58F and T37. On the other<br>
hand, various acetosyringone analogues reported not to induce the vir genes did not act<br>
as growth inhibitors. Mutants of strain C58F lacked the capacity to induce a virB::/acZ<br>
fusion in the presence of acetosyringone. The drawback of this report is that while<br>
some inducers were promotive, others are inhibitory and are also strain specific.<br>
Delmotte et al., 1991 (Delmotte FM; Delay D; Cizeau J; Guerin B; Leple JC<br>
1991 .Agrobacterium vir-inducing activities of glycosylated acetosyringone,<br>
acetovanillone, syringaldehyde and syringic acid derivatives. Phytochemistry., 30: 11,<br>
3549-3552.) reported that when A. tumefaciens str. A348 (pSM358) harbouring a<br>
virE::lacZ fusion plasmid was used to detect the ability of 13 synthetic acetosyringone,<br>
acetovanillone, syringaldehyde and syringic acid beta-glycosides to induce virulence,<br>
the activity of the reporter beta-galactosidase was detected by spectrofluorimetry using<br>
4-methylumbelliferyl beta-galactopyranoside as substrate. Acetosyringonyl beta-Lfticopyranoside<br>
was the most active monoglycoside tested; even at high concentrations<br>
this compound was devoid of toxic effects. However, monoglycosides were less active<br>
vir inducers than free acetosyringone. In contrast, the beta-maltoside of syringaldehyde<br>
showed higher activity than the free phenol at high concentrations. The activity of such<br>
glycosylated inducers may be related to specific sugar receptors on the bacterial cell<br>
surface. The drawback of the report is that the acetosyringone is costly compound that<br>
need to be imported from Sigma Aldrich, USA.<br>

(xxi) comparative analysis of the caffeine fraction (both autoclave and filter<br>
sterilized- please refer figures 1 and 2) and catechin fraction and the crude tea<br>
extract though HPLC using acetonitrile and phosphoric acid in gradient mode<br>
(0.05 to 0.2%) for detection of virulence inducing compound using diode array<br>
detector at 250 to 280 nm wavelength as shown in Table 1 and 2 here below.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, genetic transformation in plants<br>
via Agrobacterium is brought about by induction of virulence or vir genes and transfer(Table Removed)<br>
of the Ti plasmid harbouring the transgene into the plant tissue. Transgenes that code<br>
for desirable traits like disease and stress resistance, crop quality, flavors, colors, better<br>
shelf life when introduced into the plant tissues can bring about crop improvement in a<br>
shorter time than conventional breeding. Generally phenolic inducers are responsible<br>
for the induction of the vir genes and the popular commercially available inducers are<br>
the acetosyringone or the hydroxy-acetosyringone. These commercially available<br>
inducers are not only expensive but are also confined to few select companies like<br>
Sigma Aldrich, USA.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, caffeine fraction of tea leaves has<br>
the potential for substituting these commercially available inducers as they can induce<br>
the vir genes and bring about genetic transformation. This natural fraction that is easily<br>
available is not only cost effective but can also improve the transformation efficiency.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence inducer caffeine<br>
fraction from tea leaves can be used for transgenic production using different explants<br>
of different plant species.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, different concentrations of filter<br>
sterilized caffeine fractions of tea leaves were added as above.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, different concentrations of<br>
autoclaved caffeine fractions of tea leaves were added as above.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, Clostridium perfringens, a<br>
foodborne pathogen, exerts its toxic effect on humans when producing a toxin during<br>
sporulation in the intestine. Investigations were undertaken to determine the effect of<br>
caffeine which is consumed in large amounts worldwide in the diet, on sporulation and<br>
subsequent toxin formation. In the presence of 100 ug caffeine/ml or 200 ug<br>
theobromine/ml, sporulation of C. perfringens NCTC 8679 rose from 
Enterotoxin concentration increased from undetectable levels to 450 ug/mg of cell<br>
extract protein. Heat-resistant spore levels increased from 
and 2 X 107/ml. Caffeine caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in the percentages of cells<br>
possessing retractile spores and a similar increase in enterotoxin concentration.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the study on mechanism by which<br>
caffeine stimulates sporulation of C. perfringens indicated that cultures exposed to<br>
caffeine had significantly elevated levels of intracellular adenosine and guanosine<br>
triphosphates (Nolan LL; Labbe RG; Craker LE (ed.); Nolan L (ed.); Shetty K Effect of<br>
plant alkaloids on the sporulation of a food-borne pathogen. International symposium<br>
on medicinal and aromatic plants, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA, 27-30 Aug. 1995.<br>
Acta-Horticulturae. 1996, No. 426, 287-295).This property led us to employ the<br>
caffeine fraction from tea leaves for inducing of virulence genes in Agrobacterium<br>
mediated genetic transformations and also a substitute of an expensive chemical<br>
acetosyringone. Moreover, since the the virulence inducer caffeine fraction from tea<br>
leaves are also obtained from the maintenance foliage leaves that are generally<br>
discarded and burnt, this method appears to be all the more economical and cost<br>
effective. Use of the virulence inducer caffeine fraction from tea leaves is specially<br>
important in increasing the transformation efficiency.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, a thermolabile caffeine<br>
fraction of tea leaves - a substitute of acetosyringone for Agrobacterium mediated<br>
genetic transformations, (see figure 4)<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, a thermolabile caffeine fraction of<br>
tea leaves- a substitute for acetosyringone for Agrobacterium mediated genetic<br>
transformations obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the novelty of this method is that a<br>
cost effective natural extract was identified that could substitute for the cost of the<br>
inducers like acetosyringone and hydroxy-acetosyringone.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the caffeine fraction of tea<br>
leaves can be used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated genetic transformation of<br>
different systems or plants or explants.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, an economical system for<br>
obtaining an inducer without involving any costly extraction methods wherein the<br>
crude leaf extract with bactericidal activity is also extracted without requiring<br>
expensive instruments.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the caffeine fraction of tea leaf<br>
with virulence inducer activity can be obtained in abundance from naturally growing<br>
tea bushes.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence inducer caffeine<br>
fraction from tea leaves is of natural origin and is not of synthetic or semi-synthetic<br>
nature.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence inducer caffeine<br>
fraction from tea leaves can be obtained in abundance from actively growing apical<br>
shoots i. e. two and a bud making it economical.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence inducer caffeine<br>
fraction from tea leaves can be obtained in abundance even from the lower<br>
maintenance foliage thereby making it more economical as generally such leaves are<br>
discarded or burnt.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the crude extract can also be<br>
used during 'hairy root production' using Agrobacterium rhizogenesis.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the transformation efficiency by<br>
Agrobacterium can be increased considerably.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, use of tea leaf extract for<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens genetic transformation in different systems or plants or<br>
explants wherein the generally used synthetic inducers are ineffective.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, deriving a cost effective system<br>
for Agrobacterium tumefaciens genetic transformation wherein no commercial and<br>
yet costly inducers are used.<br>
The crude tea leaf extract in patent no NF 14/02 was obtained by using acetone and nhexane<br>
where as the caffeine fraction in patent no NF 221/02 was obtained by using<br>
solvent extraction using ethyl acetate and petroleum benzene for removal of<br>
catechins. The crude tea leaf extract contained generally catechin and caffeine<br>
whereas the caffeine fraction had only caffeine, therefore they should not be treated<br>
as one. The supporting data in figure 3 represents: Effect of different fractions of tea<br>
extract on the growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture. This clearly<br>
substantiates the difference between both the fractions.<br>
Use of caffeine fraction at concentrations of 0.5-300u,g/ml in the medium of fresh<br>
cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens instead of acetosyringone. This refers to the<br>
concentration of caffeine in the culture medium and actually refers to concentrations<br>
ranging from 0.5-300(ag of caffeine in the medium. The concentration of the inducer is<br>
indirectly estimated as the concentration of caffeine in the fraction.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not<br>
be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Two strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens viz. EHA105 (mild) and GV2260 (virulent)<br>
harbouring the antibiotic resistance genes for kanamycin or hygromycin and the<br>
reporter gus gene from mother cultures of respective strains were inoculated into 10-30<br>
ml liquid modified Yeast Mannitol Broth with kanamycin or hygromycin and incubated<br>
for 12-16 hrs at 25-30°C and 150-200 rpm in dark. Cells were harvested at 0.6-0.8<br>
optical density at 600 nm for lX109cells/ml during log phase of bacterial growth.<br>
Living bacterial cells were pelleted of by centrifugation at 15-30 minutes at 4000-8000<br>
rpm and 25-30°C. Bacterial pellet was suspended in fresh 5-25ml of Yeast Mannitol<br>
Broth without damaging the bacterial cells and cell density was optimized at<br>
lX109cells/ml by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Various explants of different<br>
plants were immersed in bacterial suspension for 5-35 minutes. Explants were blotted<br>
on filter papers to remove excess Agrobacterium tumefaciensis. Explants incubated on<br>
incubation medium for different periods of 1-10 days. Fresh tea leaves (100-500g) of<br>
Kangra jat dried in an oven at 60°C to a constant weight and extracted overnight at<br>
room temperature with 0.4-1.2 litres of 10-40% aqueous acetone and filtered. The<br>
filtrate extracted with 100-500 ml of n-hexane to obtain two layers for removing lipids.<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with petroleum ether (100-300ml) and ethyl acetate<br>
(100-400 ml) to remove catechins. The aqueous layer was taken and extracted with<br>
chloroform (100-400 ml) and ammonia solution (3-10%). The chloroform layer was<br>
concentrated to 10-50 ml and total caffeine was estimated. The concentrated<br>
chloroform layer served as a caffeine fraction and was sterilized both by autoclaving<br>
and filter sterilization method. The concentrated chloroform layer served as a caffeine<br>
fraction which was used at concentrations of 0.5-300|ig/ml in fresh cultures of<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Various explants of different plants were transferred to<br>
regeneration medium containing different concentrations of 0.5-300(^g/ml caffeine<br>
fractions for inducing the vir genes and increasing the transformation efficiency.<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens free explants were transferred to regeneration medium<br>
containing selection antibiotics for further regeneration and transgenic plant<br>
development. Comparative analysis of the three fractions viz. the caffeine fraction<br>
(both autoclave and filter sterilized), the catechin fraction and the crude tea extract<br>
though HPLC. Acetonitrile and phosphoric acid (0.05 to 0.2%) were used in gradient<br>
mode for detection of 'virulence inducing compound' with the help of diode array<br>
detector at 250 to 280 nm wavelength.<br>
Example 2<br>
Caffeine fractions were filter sterilized and used as an inducing agent instead of<br>
acetosyringone in different explants for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated<br>
transformations as described above in Example-1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Caffeine fractions were autoclaved used as an inducing agent instead of<br>
acetosyringone in different explants for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated<br>
transformations as described above in Example-1 and 2.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
(1) Caffeine fraction of tea leaf can be used as a potent virulence inducing agent for<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated genetic transformations instead of<br>
acetosyringone.<br>
(2) Caffeine fraction of tea leaf can be used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated<br>
genetic transformation in different systems or plants or explants wherein the<br>
commercially used virulence inducing agent acetosyringone is ineffective.<br>

leaf prove to be a cost effective system for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated<br>
genetic transformation.<br>
(4) Since the caffeine fraction of tea leaf with virulence acitivity is obtained without<br>
involving any expensive instruments or costly extraction methods, its use proves to<br>
be an economical method.<br>

obtained in abundance from naturally growing tea bushes round the year.<br>
(6) The caffeine fraction of tea leaf with virulence inducing ability is of natural origin<br>
and is not of synthetic or semi-synthetic nature.<br>
(7) The caffeine fraction of tea leaf with virulence inducing ability can be obtained in<br>
abundance from even the lower maintenance foliage thereby, making it more<br>
economical as generally such leaves are discarded or burnt.<br>
(8) The caffeine fraction of tea leaf can also be used as an agent with virulence<br>
inducing ability in different in vitro systems involving different plants or explants.<br>
(9) The caffeine fraction of tea leaf with virulence inducing ability can also be used<br>
during 'hairy root production' using Agrobacterium rhizogenesis.<br>
