IRON FORTIFIED FOOD PRODUCT AND ADDITIVE<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
IRON FORTIFIED FOOD PRODUCT AND ADDITIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to the field of fortified food   products. More in particular, it relates to the fortification of a food product with iron. The invention also relates to an additive for the fortification and supplementation of food and other products with iron and to a method of preparing the same.<br><br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Iron is an essential trace element in animal and human nutrition. It is a component of heme in hemoglobin and of myoglobin, cytochromes and several enzymes. The main role of<br>
   iron is its participation in the transport, storage and utilization of oxygen.<br>
Iron deficiency was and remains a common nutritional problem not only in the developing world but also in the<br>
   industrialized countries. Inadequate intake of dietary iron causes the high incidence of anemia which nutritional surveys have identified among children, adolescents and women. Since the human body does not produce minerals, it is totally dependent on an external supply of iron, either nutritional or<br>
   supplementary. The importance of adequate iron intake is recognized during the whole life of the human being. The recommended daily allowance for iron intake is from 10 to 18 mg per day, and is dependent on age and sex. Children, women up to the time of menopause, and expectant and nursing mothers<br>
   are in the group with higher requirements of iron.<br>
In general, water-soluble inorganic minerals are likely to impair the stability of the food product, and it is hard to<br><br>
WO 2007/009536                                                                          PCT/EP2006/005696<br>
Another problem in iron fortification is the capacity of iron to promote destructive free-radical reactions, which can result in off- flavors. Thus, the addition of soluble iron   sources to fat containing products - mostly products with a high level of unsaturated fatty acids - cause flavor changes due to lipid oxidation. Iron promoted oxidation not only affects the organoleptic properties of foods and beverages, but also undesirably affects the nutritional quality of these   products. These interactions can be also enhanced during heat treatment, such as pasteurization or sterilization.<br>
Finally, from a technical point of view, soluble iron salts can also cause corrosion of processing equipment.<br><br>
As alternatives to the soluble sources of iron, which are highly bioavailable but lead to an undesirable flavor and/or color, insoluble iron sources such as elemental iron, ferric pyrophosphate, etc. may be used. These forms of iron cause<br>
   little or no discoloration and off-flavor problems but are poorly bioavailable. In addition, added to drinks and liquid beverages they may cause sedimentation, which could make the mineral not available to the consumer because it remains in the package, or lost of transparency, if added to clear<br>
   products.<br>
Also, the efficiency of the uptake of iron from food fortified with large particles of water-insoluble iron salts or elemental iron, the bioavailability and bioacessability,   remain a problem due to slow dissolution of the mineral.<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
Finally, from a technical point of view, the use of insoluble<br>
large particles of insoluble iron salts can cause abrasion and<br>
severe damage of the mixing and processing equipment.<br>
  So far, few attempts have been made to simultaneously address these very complex issues. For example, EP-B-870 435 (Taiyo Kagaku) discloses a mineral-containing composition having improved dispersion stability and comprising enzymatically decomposed lecithin and water-insoluble mineral, preferably<br>
   Fe(III) or ferric pyrophosphate. The use of enzymatically decomposed lecithin is essential for achieving the desired dispersion stability. A major drawback of these compositions is that the emulsifier lecithin has to be present. It is known that lecithin has not very pleasant taste. In addition, the<br>
   use of emulsifier makes the product particularly costly and not appealing to the consumer.<br>
Products containing lecithin are "Generally Recognised As Safe" (GRAS) under 21 CFRa 184.1400 and specifications of the<br>
   Food Chemicals Codex. Lecithin products that have been<br>
modified sometimes require special labelling. For example, when enzymatically modified, the phrase "Enzymatically Modified Lecithin" should appear on labelling. Finally, lecithin is known to vary significantly in quality from batch<br>
   to batch causing extra difficulties in food processing.<br>
In many cases the unnecessary use of emulsifiers is not desirable. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a nutritional additive that fulfils the above-mentioned requirements for stability without the necessity of using enzymatically-decomposed lecithin.<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an iron fortified food product and iron-containing additive, which overcomes one or more of the above mentioned drawbacks. Surprisingly, it has now been found that this object can be   achieved by the food product according to the invention, having and iron content of at least 5 ppm (R. F. Hurrell, Preventing Iron Deficiency Through Food, Fortification, Nutrition Reviews, Vol. 55, No. 6), comprising iron-containing nanoparticles stabilised with biopolymers. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention provides a food product which has been fortified in iron, having iron content  of at least 5 ppm, comprising iron-containing nanoparticles, wherein the nanoparticles are stabilised by means of a biopolymer.<br>
According to a second aspect, there is provided an iron   containing additive for use in the food and other products according to the invention, in the form of an iron-containing nanoparticles having a diameter of 5 - 1000 nanometer, wherein the nanoparticles are stabilised by means of a biopolymer.<br>
   According to a third aspect, there is provided a process for preparing the iron-containing additive of the invention and according to a fourth aspect, there is provided a process for making the food product of the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention regards an iron-fortified food product having an iron content of at least 5 ppm iron (Fe). The food product<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
comprises iron in the form of iron-containing biopolymer-<br>
stabilised nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are defined for the<br>
purpose of this invention as particles stabilised by the<br>
presence of protective biopolymer. They have a particle size<br>
  of about 5 to 1000 nanometer. The compositions of the<br>
invention contain biopolymer-stabilised iron containing<br>
nanoparticles, which have an effective average particle size<br>
of less than about 1000 nm. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the biopolymer stabilised iron containing<br>
   nanoparticles have an effective average particle size of less than about 900 nm, preferably less than about 800 nm, less than about 700 nm, less than about 600 nm, less than about 500 nm, less than about 400 nm, less than about 300 nm, less than about 250 nm, less than about 200 nm, less than about 150 nm,<br>
   less than about 100 nm, less than about 75 nm, or even less than about 50 nm.<br>
The effective average particle size can be measured using techniques that are well known in the art, such as electron   microscopy or light scattering techniques. The nanoparticles may be crystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous.<br>
The iron containing nanoparticles used in the present invention are stabilised by means of a biopolymer and their<br>
   derivatives, such as, polyamides (e.g. proteins and poly(amino acids)), polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose, starch and xanthan), organic polyoxoesters synthesized by bacteria and eukaryotic organisms (e.g. poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids), poly(malic acid), polylactides, polyglycolide, polyanhydrides, polyesteramides<br>
   and cutin), polythioesters, polyphosphate, polyisoprenoids (e.g. natural rubber or Gutta Percha), polyphenols (e.g. lignin or humic acids), and nucleic acids such as ribonucleic acids and deoxyribonucleic acids. The most preferred<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
biopolymers are polyamides (peptides, proteins, polyamino acids) and polysaccharides.<br>
The polyamide (protein) source may be any specific type of   protein, e.g. animal (collagens and gelatines), in particular dairy protein, or plant protein. The plan protein sources are for example soy, pea, amaranth, canola (rape), carob, corn, oat, potato, sesame, rice, wheat, lupin protein, or mixtures thereof.  These proteins can be intact or partially hydrolysed, and can be used separately or in combination with each other. The preferred protein source is whey protein or soy protein.<br>
The polysaccharide source can be used as stabilisers,   particularly polysaccharide gums. Preferred stabilisers are selected from the group of locust bean gum, tamarind seed polysaccharide, alginates, alternan, cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (anionic), cell wall polysaccharides from fungi, chitin, chitosan, curdlan,   dextran, elsinan, emulsan, gellan, glycogen, glycopeptides, seed gums, hyaluronan, inulin, levan, lipopolysaccharides and other extracellular polysaccharides, peptidoglycans from archaea and bacteria, pectin, pullulan, schizophyllan, scleroglucan, succinoglycan, starch, teichoic acids,   teichuronic acids and xanthan gum, guar gum, tara gum, gum arabic, kalaya gum, carrageenan, agar soybean polysaccharides and mixtures thereof. The preferred polysaccharide source is gum arabic.<br>
   One or more auxiliary non-polysacccharide stabilisers may be used in addition to the polysaccharide stabiliser(s). In particular, examples of auxiliary stabilisers are glycol alginate esters, methoxy pectin (HM-pectin), sodium<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na), propylene glycol alginate ester (PGA) and beet-derived pectin (BD-pectin), OSA starch. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
  Incidentally, the biopolymer can be used together with other nonionic or negatively charged surfactants. It is desired that the surfactant is usually used so as to be contained in the mineral additive of the present invention in the range of from 0 to 20% by weight.<br><br>
The amount of the biopolymer to be used may be generally about 0.01 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 5 wt.%, and preferably around 1% wt. with respect to the total amount of non-dried product containing nanoparticles, but these ranges do not<br>
   restrict the scope of the invention because they may vary depending on differences in the type of biopolymer and concentration of nanoparticles. The weight ratio of biopolymer to iron-containing nanoparticles is generally at least about 1:10,000 or higher (e.g. more biopolymer in comparison to<br>
   nanoparticle mass).<br>
The advantages of using the biopolymer-stabilised iron-containing nanoparticles according to the present invention are the excellent chemical stability in respect to interaction<br>
   with other elements, oxidation, complexion activity, and<br>
colour change due to the low concentration of free iron ions these than soluble iron salts. Very importantly, due to the presence of stabilising biopolymer, these particles are compatible with many products containing other biopolymers.<br><br>
Furthermore, due to their low chemical activity, these iron containing nanoparticles allow multiple fortification with<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
vitamins, other minerals such as Ca, Zn, Mn, Mg, Cu, Se and other micro-nutrients.<br>
Due to their very small particle size, sedimentation is very    slow or completely negligible in comparison to large<br>
particles, which provides excellent physical stability of liquid and semi-liquid products.<br>
In addition, the nanoparticles have excellent dispersibility   in aqueous phases, including emulsions and gels, and in products comprising the same.<br>
Due to their small particle size, the mineral compositions have a good bioavailability and bioacessability in comparison   to large particles of the same compound.<br>
Due to their small size and low solubility, these substances don not cause adverse organoleptic effects, such bad (metallic) taste, chalkiness and sandiness.  <br>
Furthermore, due to their small size, these substances do not have significant abrasion effect on the equipment.<br>
The iron-fortified food products of the present invention can   be advantageously in the form of beverages, (dry) soups, fat spreads, (yoghurt or protein) drinks, dressings or cereal products like bread.<br>
A second aspect of the invention is an iron-containing    additive for use in the food or other products as iron<br>
supplement according to any one of the preceding claims, in the form of iron containing nanoparticles of iron insoluble inorganic or organic salt, or mixtures thereof, and having a<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
particle size of 5 to 1000 nanometer, wherein the nanoparticles are stabilised by means of a biopolymer.<br>
The iron-containing	additive preferably comprises a low-<br>
  soluble salt having	a Ks of 10"7 or less. By low soluble we<br>
mean a Ks, where Ks	is the solubility product, of 10-7 or<br>
less.<br>
The forms of the water-insoluble minerals generally include   inorganic salts, organic salts, and the like. The inorganic salts include, for example, ferrous and ferric oxides (e.g. Fe2O3, Fe3O4), hydroxides (e.g. FeOOH, Fe(OH)3), carbonates (e.g. FeCO3, Fe2(CO3)3, phosphates ( e.g. Fe3(PO4)2, FePO4, Fe2P2O7, Fe4(P2O7)3, FeNH4PO4) or other inorganic insoluble iron 15 salts or mixtures thereof. Examples of organic low-soluble salts are iron - partially hydrolysed proteins, iron phytate or other sufficiently low soluble organic salts of iron. Each of those inorganic salts can be used alone or in admixture of two or more salts.  <br>
More preferably, the low-soluble iron salt is selected from the group of iron phosphates, more preferably pyrophosphate and iron orthophosphate or mixtures thereof.<br>
    The iron containing food product is prepared by mixing the iron-containing additive as dispersed in liquid or dried form using a suitable mixing process known in the art.<br>
The amount of iron in the food product is at least 5 ppm iron  (Fe), but preferably it is at least 10, 20, 50 or even 100 ppm.<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
According to another embodiment, the iron-containing additive is prepared by chemical homogeneous or inhomogeneous precipitation in the presence of the biopolymer or a mixture of biopolymers. The precipitation can be achieved by fast  mixing, using any suitable fast mixing process, of two<br>
solutions or (liquid-in-liquid, liquid-in-gas, gas-in-liquid, or solid-in-liquid or mixtures) dispersions containing iron ions and counter ions that form insoluble iron salt, respectively. The biopolymer can be present in either or in   both phases. The pH of the final product can be from 2 to 8, preferably between 6 and 7. Preferably, the biopolymer is present in the system containing ions that do not interact strongly with the biopolymer.<br>
   	 The resulting iron-containing biopolymer-stabilised<br>
nanoparticles can be separated from the mother liquid and dried e.g. using spray or freeze drying. Or the can be concentrated or directly dried together with the side products. Preferably, the side products should be Na, K or<br>
   	ammonium salts.<br>
The resulting iron-containing biopolymer-stabilised nanoparticles can be crystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous. In the preferred embodiment, the biopolymer- stabilised nanoparticles are amorphous or polycrystalline.<br>
Finally, the additive according to the invention, comprising iron-containing nanoparticles could be further utilized in a wide variety of fields such as cosmetics, animal feed additives, plant fertilizers, pharmaceutical products, personal and home care products.<br><br>
WO 2007/009536	PCT/EP2006/005696<br><br>
The animal feeds containing the iron-containing nanoparticles<br>
of the present invention include, for example, feeds for pets,<br>
domestic animals, cultured fishes, and the like.<br>
  Cosmetics containing the iron-containing nanoparticles of the present invention include lotion; milky lotion; bathing agents; detergents such as cleansing agents; dentifrices, skin creams and the like.<br>
   Industrial products containing the iron-containing<br>
nanoparticles of the present invention include iron-based catalysts, agricultural purposes, for slugs and snails control, sheet materials for walls or floors, additive to polymers and resins.<br><br>
