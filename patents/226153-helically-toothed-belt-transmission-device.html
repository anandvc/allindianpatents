TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
helically-toothed-belt transmission device, and<br>
particularly to a helically-toothed pulley and a<br>
helically-toothed belt used in a belt-drive transmission<br>
device that is driven under a heavy load or at a high-speed<br>

BACKGROUND ART<br>
When using straight teeth with a belt-drive<br>
transmission device, there exist problems of generating a<br>
lot of noise and vibration. As a way to solve these problems,<br>
a belt-drive transmission device that applies helical teeth,<br>
for example, is known (KOKAI No. 4-330853 (refer to claims<br>
and Fig. 3B) ) . However, for a power transmission device,<br>
such as a reduction device that is driven under a heavy load<br>
or at a high-speed rotation (e.g. 1500 rpm to 4500 rpm),<br>
the noise and the vibration are not always effectively<br>
reduced when using helical teeth.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, the embodiments of the belt-drive<br>
transmission device of the present invention, which use<br>
helical teeth, will be explained with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, behavior of the<br>
belt and generation of noise and vibration in the belt-drive<br>
transmission device using a belt with helical teeth, will be<br>
explained.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows an arrangement of an<br>
endless helically-toothed belt installed on a<br>
helically-toothed pulley, which is viewed from a back side<br>
of the belt. As shown in the figure, the helically-toothed<br>
belt 10 is entrained around a pair of helically-toothed<br>
pulleys 20 and 30 which are rotatable about respective axes<br>
"L1" and "L2". For example, the helically-toothed pulley<br>
30 is a drive pulley and the rotational power of the<br>
helically-toothed pulley 30 is transmitted to the driven<br>
pulley 20 via the helically-toothed belt 10. In Fig. 1,<br>
the helically-toothed belt 10 described by a solid line<br><br>
indicates an arrangement of the helically-toothed belt<br>
immediately after the belt installation. On the other hand,<br>
a phantom line indicated by a reference number 10'<br>
represents a position of the helically-toothed belt 10<br>
after the belt-drive transmission device is driven.<br>
Immediately after the helically-toothed belt 10 is<br>
installed on the helically-toothed pulleys 20 and 30<br>
(before the belt-drive transmission device is driven),<br>
teeth traces of the helically-toothed belt 10 coincide with<br>
teeth traces of the helically-toothed pulleys 20 and 30,<br>
so that the longitudinal direction of the helically-toothed<br>
belt 10 is made substantially perpendicular to the<br>
rotational axes "L1" and "L2" of the helically-toothed<br>
pulleys 20 and 30. However, when the helically-toothed<br>
pulley 30 or the drive pulley is driven and the load bears<br>
upon the helically-toothed belt 10, the helically-toothed<br>
belt 10 skids along the teeth traces of the pulleys, thus<br>
a thrust occurs. Namely, when the belt-drive transmission<br>
device is driven, the hellcally-toothed belt 10 skids on<br>
the helically-toothed pulley 20 m the "A" direction along<br>
the rotational axis "L1", and skids on the<br>
helically-toothed pulley 30 in the "B" direction, which is<br>
opposite to the "A" direction, along the rotational axis<br>
"L2", as shown in Fig. 1. Thereby, the helically-toothed<br>
belt 10, represented by the solid line, is moved to the<br><br>
position 10' which is represented by the phantom line. This<br>
type of thrust is prominent when the belt-drive<br>
transmission device is operated under a heavy load or at<br>
a high-speed rotation.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic enlarged view showing the<br>
relations between the teeth traces of the helically-toothed<br>
pulley 30 and the teeth traces of the helically-toothed belt<br>
10 engaged thereto, after the belt-drive transmission<br>
device operation is started or after thrust has occurred.<br>
As shown in the figure, a tooth trace 11 of the<br>
helically-toothed belt 10 is inclined against a tooth trace<br>
31 of the helically-toothed pulley 30 to the amount of<br>
angles where the belt has slanted by the skid, so that the<br>
tooth trace 11 slips out of the tooth trace 31. When a gap<br>
is induced between the tooth trace of the helically-toothed<br>
belt 10 and the tooth trace of the helically-toothed pulley<br>
30, inadequate contact is generated between the pulley and<br>
the belt, for example a shoulder (a part connecting a<br>
working flank and a tooth tip cylinder) of the pulley<br>
contacts a mating flank of the belt, or the like. Such<br>
inadequate engagement generates noise and vibration. Note<br>
that, as can be seen from Fig. 1, the same phenomena are<br>
induced on the helically-toothed pulley 20.<br>
In order to solve such problems, backlash between<br>
the belt and the pulley is selectively enlarged in a first<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention, so as to prevent<br>
inadequate contact between the pulley teeth and the belt<br>
teeth and reduce noise and vibration. Referring to Fig.<br>
3, the definition of backlash in the present embodiment will<br>
be explained.<br>
In Fig. 3, (a half) tooth profiles of the belt and<br>
pulley are shown. A solid curve "P1" describes the tooth<br>
profile of the pulley and a broken curve "P2" describes the<br>
tooth profile of the belt. A straight line "B", a dash-dotted<br>
line, is the base line on a bottom land of the belt, so that<br>
a tooth height "H" is defined by the height from the base<br>
line B to the tip of the belt tooth. Further, an arc "C",<br>
which is also indicated by a dash-dotted line, is an arc<br>
that passes through a point that is distant from the base<br>
line "B" by a half of the distance of the tooth height "H"<br>
(1/2 H), and its center coincides with the center of the<br>
pulley. Namely, the diameter of the arc "C" is equivalent<br>
to a value where the tooth heights "H" are subtracted from<br>
the outside diameter of the pulley. The backlash between<br>
the belt and the pulley is defined by the distance "D"<br>
between the pulley tooth and the belt tooth at a position<br>
along the arc "C" (the distance between the intersection<br>
of the curve "P1" and the arc "C", and the intersection of<br>
the curve "P2" and the arc "C") .<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 4, an angle of the helical<br><br>
tooth applied to the endless belt of the first embodiment<br>
will be explained. Fig. 4 is a part of a schematic<br>
development of the helically-toothed belt 10, which is<br>
applied to the first embodiment. The teeth traces of the<br>
helically-toothed belt 10 are represented by the slanted<br>
solid lines which lie in the lateral direction of the belt.<br>
Here, the pitch of the belt teeth is denoted by "Pt" and<br>
the width is denoted by "W". Further, when denoting an angle<br>
(tooth helix angle) between the line in the lateral<br>
direction of the belt (or the line perpendicular to the belt<br>
longitudinal direction) and the tooth trace as "θ", a space<br>
"d" between the end of the first tooth engagement and the<br>
beginning of the neighboring second tooth engagement are<br>
represented by d = Pt-W.tan θ, using the pitch "Pt", the<br>
belt width "W", and the tooth helix angle "θ". In the first<br>
embodiment, the tooth helix angle "θ" is set so as to satisfy<br>
-0.2 
In a conventional helically-toothed-belt<br>
transmission device, although the backlash "D" is set to<br>
about 1.5% with respect to the tooth pitch "Pt", the backlash<br>
"D" of the helically-toothed-belt transmission device of the<br>
first embodiment, is set in a range of 1.6% to 3% (D/Pt x 100)<br>
of the tooth pitch "Pt".<br>
Namely, in the helically-toothed-belt transmission<br>
device of the first embodiment, an inadequate contact between<br><br>
the teeth of the pulley and the belt is prevented, even when<br>
thrust is induced on the belt when a heavy load is placed upon<br>
the belt during operation, by setting the backlash "D" widely<br>
(wide backlash) , such as at 1. 6% to 3% of the tooth pitch "Pt" .<br>
Further, this is particularly effective for the tooth helix<br>
angles "θ" that satisfy -0.2 
wide range of tooth helix angles "θ" (even for a small angle<br>
which is not very effective for a compressible tooth profile) ,<br>
the noise and the vibration can be reduced. As described<br>
above, according to the first embodiment, noise and vibration<br>
are effectively reduced for the helically-toothed-belt<br>
transmission device which is driven under a heavy load or at<br>
a high-speed rotation.<br>
Next, with reference to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, a<br>
belt-drive transmission device of a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be explained. Fig. 5 is part of a<br>
schematic development of the helically-toothed belt 10,<br>
which is applied to the second embodiment. The teeth traces<br>
of the helically-toothed belt 10 are represented by the<br>
slanted solid lines which lie in the lateral direction of<br>
the belt. Further, Fig. 6 shows a form of a compressible<br>
tooth profile applied in the second embodiment.<br>
In the belt-drive transmission belt of the second<br>
embodiment, the tooth helix angle "θ" is set in a range of<br>
d/Pt = 1 - W.tan θ / Pt 
 <br>
value of "d" is "0" or negative, so that the engagement of<br>
the neighboring second tooth starts before the end of the<br>
first tooth engagement (or simultaneous with the end of the<br>
engagement).<br>
In Fig. 6, a curve "P3" indicated by a solid line<br>
represents the tooth profile of the helically-toothed<br>
pulleys 20 and 30 of the second embodiment, and a curve "P4"<br>
indicated by a broken line represents the tooth profile of<br>
the helically-toothed belt 10 of the second embodiment.<br>
Further, a dash-dotted line "B" represents the base line of<br>
the belt when the belt is installed. A groove depth "Dp",<br>
a depth from the base line "B" to the tooth root cylinder of<br>
the pulley, is smaller than the tooth height "H" of the belt<br>
by "h". Therefore, when the helically-toothed belt 10 is<br>
entrained about the helically-toothed pulleys 20 and 30, and<br>
tension is given, the belt teeth are pressed against the tooth<br>
root cylinder of the pulley and compressed. Thereby,<br>
positioning accuracy of each of the belt teeth to the pulley<br>
grooves is improved, so that a cumulative error between the<br>
belt teeth and the pulley teeth is reduced, and the inadequate<br>
contact between the belt teeth and the pulley teeth is<br>
prevented. Note that, in the second embodiment, the<br>
compressibility (h/Hx100) of the helically-toothed belt is<br>
set within 1.5% to 5%.<br>
As described above, according to the second<br><br>
embodiment, noise and vibration are effectively reduced<br>
from the helically-toothed-belt transmission device where<br>
the tooth helix angle "θ" is within the range of d/Pt =<br>
1-W.tan 0/Pt ≤ 0, and where the device is driven under a heavy<br>
load or at a high-speed rotation, by preventing the<br>
inadequate contact between the belt teeth and the pulley<br>
teeth. Note that, the helically-toothed-belt transmission<br>
device of the second embodiment is particularly effective<br>
around a span resonance frequency.<br>
(EXAMPLES)<br>
In the following, the effect of the first embodiment<br>
and the second embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained with reference to the inventive examples and the<br>
comparative examples.<br>
For all of the inventive examples 1-5 and the<br>
comparative examples 1-4, helically-toothed belts having<br>
a tooth pitch of 3mm and a belt width 25mm, were applied.<br>
Further, the tooth helix angles of the comparative examples<br>
1, 2, and the inventive example 1, were 2°, and the tooth<br>
helix angles of the comparative examples 3, 4 , and the<br>
inventive example 2, were 5°. Further, the tooth helix<br>
angles of the comparative example 5 and the inventive<br>
examples 3 and 4 were 8°. For all of the comparative examples<br>
1, 3, and 5, a conventional tooth profile was applied, and<br>
the backlash was 1.5% of the tooth pitch, and the<br><br>
compressibility was 0%. However, the backlash of the<br>
inventive examples 1, 2, and 3 was 2.4% of the tooth pitch,<br>
and the compressibility was 0%. Further, for the<br>
comparative examples 2,4, and the inventive example 4, the<br>
backlash was 0.8% of the tooth pitch and the compressibility<br>
was 4.7%.<br>
Namely, the inventive examples 1, 2, and 3,<br>
corresponding to the first embodiment, have the wide<br>
backlash, and the inventive example 4, corresponding to the<br>
second embodiment, has a compressible tooth profile. Note<br>
that, the comparative examples 2 and 4, corresponding to<br>
the examples where a compressible tooth profile is used,<br>
have the tooth helix angle of the first embodiment.<br>
In Fig. 7, the result of noise tests for the<br>
comparative examples 1, 2 and the inventive example 1, when<br>
the tooth helix angles were 2°, is shown. As is apparent<br>
from Fig. 7, when the tooth helix angles were 2°, the<br>
inventive example 1 to which the wide backlash was applied<br>
generated noise at a little less than 64dB and showed a<br>
significantly high noise-reduction effect compared to the<br>
comparative example 1 with the conventional tooth profile<br>
and the comparative example 2 with the compressible tooth<br>
profile, which generated noise above 75dB.<br>
In Fig. 8, the result of noise tests for the<br>
comparative examples 3, 4 and the inventive example 2, when<br><br>
the tooth helix angles were 5°, is shown. Even when the<br>
tooth helix angles were 5°, the inventive example 2 to which<br>
the wide backlash was applied generated noise of about 63dB<br>
and showed a significantly high noise-reduction effect<br>
compared to the comparative example 3 with the conventional<br>
tooth profile and the comparative example 3 with the<br>
compressible tooth profile, which generated noise above<br>
68dB.<br>
In Fig. 9, the result of noise tests for the<br>
comparative example 5 and the inventive examples 3 and 4 ,<br>
when the tooth helix angles were 5°, is shown. Although<br>
the comparative example 5 having the conventional tooth<br>
profile generated noise above 72dB, for the inventive<br>
examples 3 and 4, the noise was about 67dB, so that a<br>
significant noise-reduction effect was obtained compared<br>
to the comparative example 5.<br>
Note that, the wide backlash and the compressible<br>
tooth profile can also be combined (e.g. the backlash of<br>
2.3% and the compressibility of 1.5%) .<br>
