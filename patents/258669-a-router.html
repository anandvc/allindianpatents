FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a router and in general to wireless communication units<br>
and wireless networks, and more specifically to dynamic determination of route<br>
reconvergence utilized in communication networks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A router in a communication network, upon receiving a packet, can read the packet's<br>
routing information, select a route, and then forward the packet to a next router in the<br>
route. The router has collected information about routes on the network that can be used<br>
to perform route selection when forwarding packets. When the router detects a failure of a<br>
neighboring router in a current route topology, a reconvergence of the route topology<br>
occurs, in, e.g., link-state routing protocols, for example, open shortest path first (OSPF)<br>
and intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS).<br>
Reconvergence includes a process in which the router selects an alternative path to the<br>
destination networks that are affected by the failure. Reconvergence conventionally is a<br>
three step process performed by the router, which includes the following: (1) detection of<br>
the actual failure; (2) re-calculation of the route topology utilizing topology information,<br>
to obtain an alternative route to the destination in the routing information; and (3)<br>
updating the routing table in the router. Conventionally, these three steps occur in a<br>
sequential manner. Consequently, the total time of reconvergence is the sum of time for<br>
each of these steps.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In overview, the present disclosure concerns communication systems, such as an<br>
Enterprise Network, a cellular Radio Access Network, or the like, often associated with,<br>
e.g., wireless communications devices or units, often referred to as communication units,<br><br>
such as cellular phone or two-way radios and the like having the ability to send and/or<br>
receive communications, associated with a communication system. Such communication<br>
systems may further provide services such as voice and data communications services.<br>
More particularly, various inventive concepts and principles are embodied in<br>
communication systems, portions thereof, and methods therein for determining a route for<br>
a packet associated with a call to a communication unit over a communication network.<br>
It should be noted that the term communication unit may be used interchangeably herein<br>
with subscriber unit, wireless subscriber unit, wireless subscriber device or the like. Each<br>
of these terms denotes a device ordinarily associated with a user and typically a wireless<br>
mobile device that may be used with a public network, for example in accordance with a<br>
service agreement, or within a private network such as an enterprise network. Examples<br>
of such units include personal digital assistants, personal assignment pads, and personal<br>
computers equipped for wireless operation, a cellular handset or device, or equivalents<br>
thereof provided such units are arranged and constructed for operation in communication<br>
networks.<br>
The communication systems and communication units of particular interest are those<br>

The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the best modes<br>
of performing one or more embodiments of the present invention. The disclosure is<br>
further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the inventive principles<br>
and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The invention is<br>
defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during the<br>
pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and the<br>
like, if any, are used solely to distinguish one from another entity, item, or action without<br>
necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such<br>
entities, items or actions. It is noted that some embodiments may include a plurality of<br>
processes and/or steps, which can be performed in any order, unless expressly and<br>
necessarily limited to a particular order; i.e. processes or steps that are not so limited may<br>
be performed in any order.<br>
Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles when<br>
implemented, are best supported with or in software or integrated circuits (ICs), such as a<br>
digital signal processor and software therefore or application specific ICs. It is expected<br>
that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design<br>
choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic<br>
considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be<br>
readily capable of generating such software instructions or ICs with minimal<br>
experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk of<br><br>
obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention, further<br>
discussion of such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with respect<br>
to the principles and concepts used by the preferred embodiments.<br>
As further discussed herein below, various inventive principles and combinations thereof<br>
are advantageously employed to reduce a time for network reconvergence. One or more<br>
embodiments utilize a feedback from neighboring routers. A router on the communication<br>
network monitors the behavior of a neighboring router in the communication network<br>
route to confirm whether the neighboring router is in communication. For example, a<br>
conventional "hello" message can be periodically expected from the neighboring router,<br>
or a physical connection can be confirmed. Considering information including the past<br>
history of a pattern of behavior of the router in connection with confirming the<br>
communication connection, a behavior of the neighboring router for confirming<br>
communication connection can be predicted and a time utilized in route reconvergence<br>
can be reduced.<br>
According to exemplary embodiments and alternative exemplary embodiments, a<br>
conventional "hello" message is received periodically from the neighboring router, and<br>
can be stored, e.g., in a history, together with any other relevant information, e.g.,<br>
information concerning the time of arrival. From this history, information reflecting the<br>
accuracy of the neighbor router, such as average time between two "hello" messages,<br>
jitter (i.e., variation of period between two "hello" messages), and/or standard deviation<br>
from the average can be determined. With this information, the router can predict a<br>
reasonable expected maximum wait time, after which the neighboring router (or the path<br>
thereof) can be determined to have failed or at least that it is likely to have failed. The<br>
maximum wait time indicates a time period which is sufficiently long for the router to<br>
receive, e.g., the next "hello" message from the particular neighboring router.<br>
The router can maintain this information for each neighbor to which it is connected. Wait<br>
time can be different from one neighbor router to another, and/or can fluctuate over time.<br>
For example, if one neighbor router has a past history of very accurate transmission of<br>
"hello" messages with very low deviation from the mean time period, the chance of this<br><br>
router still being alive after not receiving one "hello" message for a long time period<br>
beyond the average time is rather low. On the other hand, if another router has a past<br>
history of very inaccurate and fluctuating "hello" message transmissions, the chance of<br>
this router still being alive after not receiving one "hello" message for the same time<br>
period is likely to be higher.<br>
In accordance with exemplary embodiments and alternative exemplary embodiments, the<br>
neighbor router failure detection and subsequent route reconvergence can be carried out<br>
based on the observed behavior of the routers in a past history, e.g., timing of "hello"<br>
messages over a sample period. The conventional failure detection technique calls for a<br>
fixed timer period configured on the router, e.g., router_dead_timer in OSPF (open<br>
shortest path first) protocol; after the fixed timer period expires without a connection<br>
confirmation, e.g., a "hello" message, the neighbor router is deemed to be or have failed<br>
and reconvergence occurs to exclude the failed router (or the path with the failed router).<br>
Detecting a router failure based on observed behavior allows a more accurate detection of<br>
true onset of failure. A shorter network reconvergence can permit faster re-routing of<br>
packets. Rapid reconvergence can be desirable for packet traffic that can carry data<br>
sensitive to timely continuity, e.g., voice over internet protocol (VoIP), other audio<br>
communications, video communications and/or other image communications.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, when the router detects that a timer based<br>
on observed behavior has expired for a neighbor router, the router can be considered<br>
likely to have failed. The router can begin a topology recalculation of a new route before<br>
the conventional router dead interval expires. Advantageously, the router can be ready to<br>
install the new route, having been calculated, immediately after the dead interval expires.<br>
In this way, the failure detection and the re-determination of topology information and<br>
selection of the new route can be overlapped.<br>
In accordance with conventional techniques for link state routing protocols, the neighbor<br>
router dead interval is determined by a pre-configured static time period. For example, the<br>
router_dead_timer in the OSPF protocol can be specified by an operator.<br><br>
According to one or more embodiments, e.g., utilizing an OSPF protocol, upon expiration<br>
of the router dead interval, the router sends the conventional link state update (LSU)<br>
information to its neighbors to inform them of the change in the network topology,<br>
thereby causing further conventional shortest path first (SPF) calculations.<br>
A time period over which the history is kept can be configurable, in accordance with one<br>
or more embodiments. The history of behaviors can begin with, e.g., a conventional initial<br>
neighbor discovery.<br>
The following observations may be considered when determining the collection of<br>
behaviors and the wait time for a neighbor router: (1) the larger the number of samples,<br>
the higher the confidence of the derived value; (2) the lower the value of standard<br>
deviation, the higher the confidence of the derived value; and (3) the derived time period<br>
advantageously is shorter than the router dead interval, in order to achieve desired time<br>
savings.<br>
The following formula, provided as an example, can assist in characterizing the properties<br>
mentioned above, and can be utilized in connection with one or more embodiments:<br>
MaxWaitTime(x) = (Avg(x) * (1 + Dev(x)/Avg(x))) * ((N(x) + 1) / N(x))<br>
Where<br>
X = router X.<br>
N(x) = number of past "hello" messages received from router X from the<br>
beginning of the measurement period.<br>
Avg(x) = average time period between two "hello" messages from router X over<br>
the sample period.<br>
Dev(x) = standard deviation of the "hello" messages received for router X over<br>
the sample period.<br>
Further in accordance with exemplary embodiments, a router and method therefore are<br>
provided in order to reduce a reconvergence time in a communication network. In<br>
accordance with one or more embodiments, a process of re-determining a route topology<br><br>
can be overlapped with a process of awaiting a failure determination with respect to a<br>
neighbor router in the path. Further, in accordance with one or more embodiments, a time<br>
utilized in connection with a determination that a pre-determined path on the router has<br>
failed (or is likely to have failed) can be determined dynamically. In exemplary and<br>
alternative exemplary embodiments, the overlapping and the dynamic determining of the<br>
time can be utilized together.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, dynamic determination of router failure time will be discussed<br>
and described. FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating simplified and representative devices for<br>
transmitting and receiving packets in an exemplary communication network 109 in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments. An exemplary communication network<br>
109, simplified for illustration, includes first router A 101, second router B 103 and third<br>
router C 105. Communication packets 107a-f can be transmitted between neighboring<br>
routers. The first router 101 on the communication network 109 can monitor the behavior<br>
of neighboring second router B 103 and third router C 105 in the communication network<br>
route 109, e.g., to confirm whether the neighboring router 103, 105 is in communication<br>
or available for communication. Conventional "hello" messages 107a, 107f can be<br>
periodically expected to be received by the first router A 101 from the second router B<br>
103 and the third router C 105. Similarly, "hello" messages 107b, 107d can be expected<br>
to be periodically transmitted from the first router A 101 to the neighbor routers A, B 103,<br>
105, in order to confirm the connection or availability of a connection. In this simplified<br>
illustration, the second router B 103 and the third router C 105 also exchange "hello"<br>
messages 107c, 107e. Packets, e.g., the "hello" messages, can be exchanged in<br>
accordance with known techniques, for example, utilizing communication interfaces on<br>
the routers and in accordance with relevant networking protocols.<br>
Considering now the first router A 101, for example, one or more embodiments can<br>
provide that the calculation of a new route and the time awaiting the dead interval timer<br>
can be overlapped somewhat, if not entirely. Accordingly, the first router A 101 can be<br>
configured to facilitate calculating an alternate path in the communication network 109<br>
for routing a packet received utilizing the communication interface while awaiting a<br>
determination that a pre-determined path for the packet has failed. The calculation of the<br><br>
alternate path in the communication network 109 can be performed in accordance with<br>
known techniques, utilizing for example known re-convergence techniques that omit the<br>
failed path. The determination that a pre-determined path for the packet is or is deemed to<br>
have failed can be made in accordance with known techniques. For example, in<br>
accordance with or more embodiments, a conventional dead interval timer can be utilized;<br>
upon expiration of the dead interval timer without a "hello" message from the neighbor<br>
second router B 103 or third router C 105 (whichever is in the route), the neighbor router<br>
is deemed to be failed.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the router itself can be configured to<br>
determine that the neighbor router and/or the path, pre-determined in accordance with the<br>
route topology, has failed. In accordance with exemplary and alternative exemplary<br>
embodiments, the router can determine that the path has failed, for example by observing,<br>
detecting, or receiving an expiration of the conventional dead interval timer.<br>
One or more embodiments provide that the alternate path is calculated after a delay and/or<br>
upon occurrence of certain situations, for example, upon determining that the path is<br>
likely to be failed. A determination of likely failure of the path is discussed in detail<br>
below.<br>
In accordance with exemplary embodiments and alternative exemplary embodiments, the<br>
pre-determined path including a network element, e.g., the neighboring router, can be<br>
determined to be likely to be failed based at least in part on prior behaviors of the network<br>
element. For example, conventional "hello" messages are received by the first router A<br>
101 from, e.g., the neighboring second router B 103, together with information<br>
concerning the time of arrival. The information reflects a history of prior behaviors. From<br>
the behaviors of the second router B 103, information reflecting the accuracy of periodic<br>
transmission of messages, e.g., as average time between messages, jitter (i.e., variation of<br>
period between two "hello" messages), and/or standard deviation from the average can be<br>
determined. Information reflecting accuracy can be calculated in accordance with known<br>
techniques, e.g., known standard deviation and/or other statistical techniques. With this<br>
information, the first router A 101 can predict a reasonable expected maximum wait time<br><br>
with respect to the second router B 103, indicating a period which is normally long<br>
enough for the first router A 101 to receive the next message, e.g., "hello" from the<br>
second router B 103. After the reasonable expected maximum wait time expires without a<br>
"hello" message, the second router B 103 can be determined to be likely to be failed.<br>
Advantageously, the behaviors can be collected from one or more network elements, e.g.,<br>
routers, which are adjacent to the first router A 101 according to a route topology that is<br>
currently utilized by the first router A 101. The route topology can change, e.g., routers<br>
can be added and/or removed. Hence, the network elements that are monitored for<br>
inclusion of behaviors can be added and/or removed from the history of past behaviors. A<br>
router can be added and/or removed from the route topology in accordance with<br>
conventional procedures, and hence such procedures will not be detailed further herein.<br>
Optionally, the information regarding the prior behaviors can be collected over a period<br>
of time, e.g., a pre-defined window of time, or a pre-determined number of actions. Prior<br>
behaviors can be stored as information in a history, e.g., in a table. Optionally, prior<br>
behaviors can be accumulated and/or aggregated.<br>
Specific behaviors observed by the first router A 101 can include, e.g., an action taken by<br>
the network element, a performance of the network element on the route, and an accuracy<br>
of the network element. In accordance with one or more exemplary and alternative<br>
exemplary embodiments, behaviors can include, e.g., the performance observed with<br>
respect to the neighbor router (e.g., a time of arrival of a message), the action observed<br>
with respect to the neighbor router (e.g., a "hello" message), and/or an accuracy with<br>
respect to the neighbor router (e.g., standard deviation for timing of messages). Accuracy<br>
can be derived from information in the history including, e.g., prior messages. A time<br>
after which the neighbor router is likely to be failed can be determined based on the<br>
information in the history. For example, a maximum time for response for a particular<br>
neighbor router can include an average response time plus one or more standard<br>
deviations. After such maximum time for response expires, the neighbor router is likely to<br>
have failed.<br><br>
The calculation of an alternate path for routing the packet can include calculating a route<br>
topology, where the route topology omits the neighbor in the pre-determined path that is<br>
determined to likely have failed. The calculation of the alternate path can be performed in<br>
accordance with known techniques.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the first router A 101 can calculate an<br>
alternate path for routing a packet received utilizing the communication interface, while<br>
awaiting a first determination that a pre-determined path for the packet has failed, and/or<br>
a second determination that the pre-determined path is likely to fail. The path can<br>
correspond to a destination, for example, and thus one or more routes and paths in the<br>
routes can be appropriate. The determination that the path has failed has been previously<br>
discussed in detail. The determination that the path is likely to have failed has similarly<br>
been discussed in detail above.<br>
A process overlapping the determination and the calculation (mentioned just above) can<br>
be advantageous in situations including, for example, communications where timely<br>
arrival of packets is desirable (often noted as time sensitive or time critical), e.g., voice,<br>
other audio, video and/or other image communications, where the communication<br>
including the packet can be supported over the pre-determined path and the alternate path.<br>
The reduction of time to re-route a packet can increase the quality of the voice, other<br>
audio, and video communication by, for example, avoiding or eliminating undue blanks<br>
or voids in such communications.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the router can dynamically determine a<br>
router failure time. The first router A 101 can predict a behavior of one or more network<br>
elements, e.g., routers such as second router B 103, in a route topology, wherein the<br>
network element(s), e.g., second router B 103 can be included in a pre-determined path<br>
for routing a packet received by the first router A 101, e.g., utilizing a communication<br>
interface. Exemplary illustrations of predicting the behavior have been discussed<br>
previously in detail. According to exemplary embodiments, the first router A 101 itself,<br>
e.g., a processor therein, can be configured to facilitate determining whether the pre-<br>
determined path has failed.<br><br>
Advantageously, the behavior that is predicted can be a failure of the network element(s).<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the route topology can be re-determined,<br>
in response to a prediction that failure is likely. The re-determined route topology can<br>
exclude the network element(s) that are likely to have failed, e.g., responsive to predicting<br>
the failure.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary router of a communication network will be<br>
discussed and described. FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating portions of an exemplary<br>
router of a communication network in accordance with various exemplary embodiments.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary router 201 for use in operation of one or more<br>
embodiments. The communication device router 201 may include one or more controller<br>
205s, one or more communication interfaces or ports 207 for communication with other<br>
network elements, routers, or devices 203 over a communication network, one or more<br>
processors 209, and one or more memories 211.<br>
The processor 209 may comprise one or more microprocessors and/or one or more digital<br>
signal processors and/or one or more ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The<br>
memory 211 is coupled to the processor 209 and may comprise a read-only memory<br>
(ROM), a random-access memory (RAM), a programmable ROM (PROM), an<br>
electrically erasable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or magnetic memory or the like.<br>
The memory 211 may include multiple memory locations for storing, inter alia, an<br>
operating system, data and variables 213 for programs executed by the processor 209;<br>
computer programs for causing the processor to operate in connection with various<br>
functions such as packet processing 215, failure detection 217, failure prediction 219,<br>
route re-determination 221, and/or other processing (not illustrated); a database 223 of,<br>
e.g., information concerning routes and/or history information; and a database 225 for<br>
other information used by the processor 209. The computer programs may be stored, for<br>
example, in ROM, PROM, etc. and may direct the processor 209 in controlling the<br>
operation of the router 201.<br><br>
The processor 209 may be programmed to store and/or forward packets to other routers<br>
on the communication network, e.g., utilizing communications over the communication<br>
port 207. Conventional techniques are known for use in connection with receiving and<br>
transmitting packets over the communication network. Responsive to instructions stored<br>
in memory 211, or automatically upon receipt of certain information, e.g., a packet,<br>
utilizing the communication port 207, the processor 209 may direct communication<br>
packets, to, e.g., other routers on the communication network.<br>
FIG. 3, FIG. 4, and FIG. 5 present timing diagrams to illustrate exemplary detection of<br>
router failure, and hence path failure (FIG. 3), and prediction of router failure (FIG.4,<br>
FIG. 5), in accordance with one or more embodiments.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, detection of router failure will be discussed and described. FIG.<br>
3 is a timing diagram illustrating an example detection of failure of a router of a<br>
communication network, in accordance with various exemplary embodiments. A router<br>
can monitor incoming "hello" messages from a particular neighbor router over time, e.g.,<br>
T(sec). In the illustration, an exemplary router receives exemplary "hello" messages at 0<br>
seconds and 1 second. The neighbor router actually fails in this example between 1 and 2<br>
seconds, and consequently no further "hello" messages are received by the router. In the<br>
present example, the dead interval timer is set to 3 seconds, for example, by an operator<br>
configuring the router, and is intended to reflect a maximum time in all situations<br>
permitted between "hello" messages. The failure of the path is detected at expiration of<br>
the dead interval timer, in this example, at four seconds after the first "hello" message.<br>
The router detection failure has been previously discussed in connection with various<br>
exemplary embodiments. Router detection failure can advantageously be implemented in<br>
connection with, e.g., the router discussed for example in connection with FIG. 2.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, one or more examples illustrating a first prediction of router<br>
failure will be discussed and described. FIG. 4 is a timing diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary pattern of accurate communications detected on a communication network, in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments. In the present example, FIG. 4<br>
exhibits greater accuracy than, e.g., the router discussed in connection with FIG. 5<br><br>
(below). A router monitors incoming "hello" messages from a particular neighbor router<br>
over time, e.g., T(sec). In the illustration, an exemplary router receives exemplary "hello"<br>
messages at intervals of approximately one second. The prediction of the likely behavior<br>
of the router has been previously discussed in connection with various exemplary<br>
embodiments. Consider, for example, that the average interval between an arrival of<br>
"hello" messages is 1.05 seconds, with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. In<br>
accordance with one or more embodiments, an interval for determining that the router is<br>
likely to have failed is 1.1 seconds, derived (in this exemplary embodiments) by adding<br>
the average interval between arrivals with the standard deviation for the behaviors in the<br>
history information. Router behavior prediction can advantageously be implemented in<br>
connection with, e.g., the router discussed for example in connection with FIG. 2.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, one or more examples illustrating a second prediction of router<br>
failure will be discussed and described. FIG. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary pattern of inaccurate communications detected on a communication network,<br>
in accordance with various exemplary embodiments. As in the prior example, the router<br>
monitors incoming "hello" messages from a particular neighbor router over time, e.g.,<br>
T(sec). In the illustration, an exemplary router receives exemplary "hello" messages,<br>
sometimes at an interval of less than one second, sometimes at an interval approaching<br>
two seconds. In comparison with die example of FIG. 4 (illustrating an accurate pattern),<br>
FIG. 5 exhibits a pattern with much lower accuracy. The prediction of the likely behavior<br>
of the router has been previously discussed in connection with various exemplary<br>
embodiments. Consider, in this example, that the average interval between arrival of<br>
"hello" messages is 1.30 seconds, with a standard deviation of 0.50 seconds. In<br>
accordance with one or more embodiments, an interval for determining that the router is<br>
likely to have failed is 1.8 seconds, derived (in this exemplary embodiment) by adding the<br>
average interval with the standard deviation for the behaviors in the history. Router<br>
behavior prediction can advantageously be implemented in connection with, e.g., the<br>
router discussed for example in connection with FIG. 2.<br>
The pattern of historical behavior for the router in the example of FIG. 4 is more accurate,<br>
and the pattern of historical behavior for the router in the example of FIG. 5 is less<br><br>
accurate. A predicted behavior for the router in the example of FIG. 4 is more strict or<br>
deterministic than for FIG. 5, and results in a shorter time for predicting likely failure.<br>
On the other hand, the predicted behavior for the router in the example of FIG. 5 is less<br>
strict than FIG. 4, with a longer time for predicting likely failure. In any event, the time<br>
for determining a likely failure according to the examples of FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 can be<br>
less than the time for determining an actual failure, e.g. 3 seconds or on average 2.5<br>
seconds, according to the example of FIG. 3.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, an example process for a prediction of the behavior of a<br>
neighbor, e.g., a next router in a communications network topology will be discussed and<br>
described. FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary procedure for prediction of a<br>
behavior of a neighbor 601 in a communication network, in accordance with various<br>
exemplary and alternative exemplary embodiments. Advantageously, the procedure<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6 can be implemented, for example, on the processor illustrated in FIG.<br>
2 or other suitable arranged apparatus.<br>
The procedure provides for getting 603 a history of behaviors of the network element,<br>
e.g., the neighbor router according to the route topology. The history of behaviors has<br>
been previously discussed in detail. The history can be maintained in any appropriate<br>
means, e.g., memory, storage of a list, storage of a table, etc.<br>
Having obtained the history, the procedure provides for determining 605 a next likely<br>
behavior of the neighbor router from the history, for example, a likely time when the<br>
network element (e.g., the neighbor router) will take the next action (e.g., send a "hello"<br>
message). Various exemplary embodiments and alternative exemplary embodiments may<br>
implement various known techniques and methodologies to accomplish a determination<br>
of a time for a next likely action. Exemplary processes for determining a next likely<br>
behavior, e.g., the time of a "hello" message, have been discussed above in more detail.<br>
The exemplary procedure provides for determining 607 an error based, e.g., on the history<br>
of behaviors, and adjusting the time for the next action accordingly. For example, where<br>
the next likely behavior time reflects an average time, the time can be adjusted to<br><br>
accommodate a standard deviation. Various exemplary embodiments and alternative<br>
exemplary embodiments may implement various known techniques and methodologies to<br>
accomplish a determination of an appropriate adjustment of the time. The procedure 609<br>
can end, and in accordance with one or more embodiments, can return a value for further<br>
use, e.g., a predicted behavior of the neighbor. The predicted behavior of the neighbor can<br>
be utilized as discussed in detail above.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, exemplary and simplified relevant portions of a processing of<br>
packets by a router on a communication network will be discussed and described. FIG. 7<br>
is a flow chart illustrating exemplary portions of packet processing at a router, in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments. Advantageously, the procedure<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7 can be implemented, for example, on the processor illustrated in FIG.<br>
2. In the present exemplary illustration, first and second processes handle packets (e.g.,<br>
"hello" packets) 701, 703 and packets for routing (e.g., communication packets) 705, 707,<br>
709, 711. The two processes can run logically in parallel, although alternative<br>
implementations are possible.<br>
A first process 701, 703 handles packets received. A relevant action 701 is received from<br>
a particular network element (e.g., a neighbor router), such as a "hello" message. The<br>
action 703 is stored in a history of actions by the particular network element, as described<br>
in greater detail previously. The first process loops to continue handling packets received<br>
701.<br>
A second process 705, 707, 709, 711 handles packet routing. The second process receives<br>
705 a communication packet to be transmitted further along the communication network,<br>
utilizing a network element (e.g., a neighbor router) on a route.<br>
The second process can determine 707 whether the neighbor on the route has failed<br>
and/or is likely to have failed. Processes and devices for determining failure or likely<br>
failure, and examples thereof, have been described previously in detail.<br><br>
If the neighbor 709 has failed or is likely to have failed, the second process can determine<br>
an alternate route for the packet. Determining an alternate route has been described<br>
previously. The second process 711 can transmit the packet to the neighbor on the route.<br>
The neighbor can be the next network element in the route according to the original route<br>
topology, or if the route was re-determined, can be the next network element in the re-<br>
determined route topology.<br>
The second process can loop to continue handling packets received 705.<br>
While much of the balance of this disclosure describes, for example, various uses of the<br>
"hello" message, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the same advantages can be<br>
achieved and that the same principles can be applied, for example, to messages,<br>
communications, and other means of conveying information and/or status of a neighbor,<br>
in addition to the conventional "hello" message described in the examples and alternative<br>
examples utilized above to illustrate various principles.<br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various embodiments in<br>
accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true, intended, and fair scope and<br>
spirit thereof. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims, as they may be<br>
amended during the pendency of this application for patent, and all equivalents thereof.<br>
The foregoing description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
precise form disclosed. Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above<br>
teachings. The embodiment(s) was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of<br>
the principles of the invention and its practical application, and to enable one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various<br>
modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and<br>
variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims, as<br>
may be amended during the pendency of this application for patent, and all equivalents<br>
thereof, when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally,<br>
