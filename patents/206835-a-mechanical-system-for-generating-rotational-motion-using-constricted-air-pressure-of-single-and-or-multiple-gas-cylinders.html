				<td>Field of Invention :<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanical system for generating rotational motion using pressure of constricted air. Some gas cylinder with piston have been used in this system. Constricted air gives pressure on piston and when the piston is unlocked then the piston will be moving upward by help of the pressure of constricted air. This linear motion of the piston is converted into rotating motion resulting in rotation in wheel.<br>
This mechanical system can be used in car , motor car , torch light , lantern etc. Velocity of car will be same to that of oil in engine of car when using the said mechanical system.<br>
Moreover every day the large number of poisonous smoke is spreading in air by using oil in Engine and for this step by step the environment is poisoning day after day. That problem will be solved by using this mechanical system. Nowadays Electric is not supplied in many village or in which village Electric supply is present but power cut may be occurred . In summer season public suffer from hot but in this time man can use fan by using the present invention. Electric lamp will be lighting by the mechanical system but needs a electric generator.<br>
In village or town lantern is lighted by using kerosene oil. But without kerosene oil lantern can also be lighted by using this mechanical system but needs a electric lamp &amp; small electric generator.<br>
Again torch can also be lighted by using the present invention which needs a small electric generator . Power can be supplied in this new type of torch or lantern by help a little physical labour.<br>
Again also power can be supplied to the torch or lantern from Electric but needs a electric motor , yet it has facility . Normally battery cells are charged by electricity and it takes 12 to 24 hours . But the present invention takes a little time to be charged by an electric motor.<br><br>
Object of Invention:<br>
Accordingly , one object of the present invention is to provide a mechanical system for generating rotational motion using constricted air pressure of a cylinder.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mechanical system for generating rotational motion using constricted air pressure of multiple cylinders.<br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide an eco-friendly mechanical system that doesn't use gasolene/diesel for generation of rotational motion as well as power thereby reducing the draw - backs of polluting conventional system generating rotational motion and / or power.<br>
	Summary of the Invention :<br>
To achieve The aforesaid objectives of the present invention,a mechanical system<br>
for generating rotalional motion using constricted air presure of single and/or<br>
multiple gas cylinders has been desired.<br>
The present invention is divided into five parts.	<br>
The mechanical system has a gas cylinder which has a piston on its head. The bottom of the piston is in the gas cylinder. It will never come out. It will only move up and down inside the cylinder. As a result air inside the cylinder will never come out. If some pressure is given on the piston it will move downward inside the cylinder. The air inside the cylinder will be compressed. If the pressure is withdrawn, the piston will move upwards by the pressure of the compressed air.<br>
This linear displacement because of the upward movement of the piston is transformed into circular motion by some Mechanical arrangements.<br>
There is no air inside the gas cylinder under ordinary pressure. Air is kept inside the cylinder by giving tremendous pressure by compressor machine. Tremendous pressure is needed to lower the piston on cylinder into the cylinder. When the piston will move upward, piston will also move upward by pressure.<br>
There are arrangement to lock and unlock the piston. The piston is locked by lowering it to a definite length inside the cylinder by pressure. If the piston is unlocked, there will be upward displacement of some length of the piston.<br>
A rack is on the head of piston. A pinion is attached with rack. This pinion is attached with other pinion. In this way some pinions are attached with<br>
3<br><br>
one another. Last pinion's shaft has a wheel. On all sides of this wheel's<br>
circumference has ten numbers of rods in definite distance and definite length<br>
and rods stay with circumference vertically. The last part of the machine is fifth<br>
part. The wheel attached with ten rod is included in fifth part.<br>
Fifth part:<br>
This segment has three machine parts.<br>
1.	One shaft has a little pinion and a wheel. Ten rods in definite distance<br>
and definite lengths are around the circumference the wheel.<br>
2.	There is a balencer which control the moving of the wheel.<br>
3.	A piston, crank, connecting rod, crank shaft and flywheel.<br>
These three parts of the mechanical system are placed in such way so that when the said system will be moved, Then end of the Ten Rod one after one will give pressure to the head of the piston and piston will get down, then crank, crank shaft and flywheel will move and piston will get up and next rod's end will give pressure to the head of piston. Then piston again will get down. In this way again and again the piston will be getting up and down. As result crank shaft, flywheel will have moved.   '<br>
The piston of gas cylinder will move upward in unlocked condition because of tremendous pressure . The piston with gas cylinder will move upward once. Then the piston having crank will move up and down respectivly. As a result crank shaft and flywheel will move at a great speed.<br>
A small portion of the pressure that moved the piston of the cylinder upword in unlocked condition will exert pressure on the head of the piston by the end of that rod. Only then the said system will run for longer period.<br>
When the upward movement of the piston of the gas cylinder in unlocked condition tremendous pressure comes to an end. The said system will not move further. Like the winding of watch, The piston of the said mechanical system will be locked by lowering it with the pressure. In this way can wind this machine. If the piston of the gas cylinder is unlocked, the said system will start functioning.<br>
4<br><br>
The following sections describe the said mechanical system for two different cases.<br>
Case 1: The mechanical system runs for a specified time span when the gas cylinder is unlocked . But this does not ensure continuous running of the said system for long hours. This problem is solved by using one more little gas cylinder or a big gas cylinder comparative. There are two solid pipes. Around the body of every pipe has some hole in definite distance. It has hole of definite radious and definite length vertically in its own axis. Those holes are orderly arrangement on the body of the pipe. It is twisted to look. In every hole of the pipe has a piston with gas cylinder. Along the centre of every solid pipe has a shaft. To keep the shaft fixed two solid pipes are moved like wheel. Then every pipe will be moving forwards along the shaft. It will be also moving backwards. "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"are two. One is No-1 and other No-2 "power supplying cell". This two power supplying cell is first part of the system.<br>
Two "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" stand mutually like horizontal in definite distance as parallel. There are two racks, suppose A &amp; B with holder attached at bottom. One rack(A) is standing just above "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"No-1 in a perpendicular position. The other rack(B) is standing just above "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" No-2 in a perpendicular position. When the rack will come down, the holders at the bottom of Rack(A) &amp; (B) will be stuck at the head of the piston of gas cylinder of "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" No-1 or No-2 respectively. There is a rod on both side partly round pinion. Such are two parts, one" rod on both side partly round pinion. Such a part is attached with rack (A) by partly round pinion and partly round pinion of other side by round pinion are attached with help of a round pinion of a big shaft. Partly round pinion of one side of other rod is attached with rack (B). Partly round pinion of other side with a n a t h e r round pinion is attached with a half round pinion of that big shaft in the same way. A big round pinion of big shaft is attached with next fourth part, eight partly round pinion, four by four are in special places.These partly pinions are doing the work of semi automatic system i.e No-1 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"of which cylinder attached with a piston which is<br>
5<br><br>
unlocked, begins to rise up. As result rack (A) also will go up and by pinion attached with rack(A) big shaft will move.At that time by partly round pinion No-2 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" will move the definite circle and piston attached cylinder will come under other rack(B) and rack(B) coming down and it will stick the head of piston and the piston will be unlocked. Then the piston will be rise up. At that time again No -1 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" will move the definite circle and second piston will come under the first rack (A) and (A) rack will come below and under the rack the holder will stick to the head of piston. Then the piston will be unlocked. As result piston will begin to go upwards. Firstly No-1 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"of which first piston will rise up and with the end of rising up of No-1 piston, No-2 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" of which piston will begin to rise up and with the end of rising up of piston, No-1 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" of which second piston will begin to rise up. In this way one by one piston is unlocked and will rise up.<br>
All partly pinion and half round pinion and big round pinion and semi automatic system are third part.<br>
Case 2 : As soon as the gas-cylinder is unlocked , the piston attached to the said cylinder will receive a heavy upward thrust. The amount of pressure or thrust will be lesser gradually when the said piston moves in upward direction. Apparently, it may appear that the motion of the final output shaft may not be uniform always. There are two main actfull shaft in fourth part of the system. Of these two main actfull shaft every has special twisted pinion.This special type twisted pinion is attached each other. In fourth part high and low pressure are change into equal pressure and next pinion of shaft is giving equal pressure. As result the system will be moving in equal pressure. The unlock piston of gas cylinder is rising up by tremendous pressure.<br>
The power of this pressure 80-85% will make move the system. 5%<br>
power is spending in semi automatic system. Rest 10-15%	may         be<br>
spoiled by friction.<br>

In shaft(23) a big round pinion(22) ia attached to round pinion(21). In shaft(23) two twisted pinion (25), (26) of special type are placed. This twisted pinion is attached to ordinary twisted pinion(27) of shaft(24) which has a big round pinion(28). When the unlocked piston of gas cylinder is rising upwards, piston feels much and less pressure. This changed pressure is changed into equal pressure by special type of pinion attached to a shaft (23), (24) and this equal pressure is sending to next pinion by round pinion(28). A little round pinion(30) is attached to round pinion(28) which is placed in the shaft (29) to which a big round pinion is attached. This big round pinion(31) is attached to littlepinion(33) of the shaft(32) which has a wheel(34). Along the circumference of this wheel(34) round which ten rod(35) of definite length and distance is situated.<br>

A holder(l 3) with rack(l 2) on the head of piston attaches to the gas cylinder is standing vertically on No-1 power supplying cell and of No-2 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple<br>
cylinders" a holder(57) with rack(56) on the head of piston attached to the gas cylinder is standing vertically on No-2 "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders".<br>
rack(12) and Rod(l 6) on both side partly pinion(l 5)&amp;(17) with the help of round pinion (18) are situated to the big shaft(20) with help of a round pinion(l 8) and half round pinion(l 9) is attached. Other rack(5 6) also with rod(5 9) on both side partly pinion(60), (61) and with the help of round pinion(63) are attached to big shaft(20) with half round pinion(64). There are four and four total eight partly round pinion in special places in big shaft(20). By these (65,66,67,68,69, 70, 71,72) partly round pinions and some more parts of the system will do the work of semi automatic system. It is understood to say the semi automatic system that the piston of gas cylinder of "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" no-1 andNo-2 one by one is unlocked and as result piston will rise upwards. This system is called semi automatic system. In shaft(20) all partly round pinion and half round pinion and big round pinion(21) which are auto system has been shown in third part. In shaft(20) big round pinion(21) is attached to big round pinion(22). The next description has been said in fig.-6.<br>
Semi Automatic system are divided into three parts: 1. Group(A)    2. Group(B)    3. Group(C)<br>
9<br><br>
This mechanical system is divided into five parts.<br>
First Part: Figure ( 7 ) shows "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders" No. - 1 , No. -2 . There is piston with gas cylinder in power supply cell.<br>
Second Part : Figure ( 7) also shows two rack(12) , &amp; (56) ; two A rod on both side partly round pinion ; two round pinion (18) &amp; (63).<br>
Third Part: It is comprised of shaft(20) , two half round pinion (19) , (64) a big round pinion (21) and eight partly round pinion ( 65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72) present in this shaft (20) . Semi- Automatic system means upward displacement method of definite length when the piston of a gas cylinder is unlocked one by one.<br>
Fourth Part: There are two shafts (23) &amp; (24) in fig (7) . There are a big round pinion (22) and two (25) &amp; (26) specially twisted pinion in shaft (23) . Shaft(24) has a big round pinion (28) and an ordinary twisted pinion (27)<br>
Fifth Part: Shaft (32) and small pinion (33) , a small wheel (34) present in the shaft in fig (7) constitute this part . Ten big rods (35) of definite length with definite distance in between them , located on the circumference of the wheel (34) , are perpendicular with the circumference . A balancer (D) , a piston (44) are joined with piston having crank (46) by a connecting rod. There are crank shaft , fly wheel.<br>
The main part of the system is gas cylinder (6) [ Fig (3) ] . There is a piston (7) on its head . Bottom of this piston (7) must be inside the cylinder(6) . It will never come out. It will only move up and down inside the cylinder. As a result air inside the cylinder will never come out. If some pressure is given on the piston , it will move downward inside the cylinder . The air inside the cylinder will be compressed . If the pressure is withdrawn , the piston will move upward by the pressure of the compressed air . This linear<br>
If<br><br>
displacement because of the upward movement of the piston is transformed into circular motion by some parts.<br>
There is no air inside the gas cylinder under ordinary pressure. Air is kept inside the cylinder by giving tremendous pressure by compressor . Tremendous pressure is needed to lower the piston (7) on cylinder into the cylinder . When the piston will move upward, Piston (7) will also move upward by pressure.<br>
There are arrangements to lock and unlock piston (7) . [ from figure (3) &amp; figure (3c) ] , the piston (7) is locked (11) by lowering it to a definite length inside down the cylinder by pressure . If the piston (7) is unlocked there will be upward displacement of some length of the piston.<br>
Figure (6) shows that there is a rack (12) on the head of piston (7) . A holder (13)<br>
is under rack (12) the holder is attached with the piston (7) . Adjacent to the holder (13)<br>
there is a round pinion (14) . The piston can be unlocked with its help. A rod (16) is on<br>
both sides of partly round pinion (15.17) . Rack (12) is connected with the partly round<br>
 pinion (15) . Round pinion (18) is attached with partly round pinion (17) . Round pinion<br>
 (18) is connected with half round pinion (19) . Half round pinion (19) is located in shaft<br>
 (20). The big round pinion (21) of shaft (20) is connected with the big round pinion (22)<br>
of shaft (23) . There are two specially twisted pinions (25 &amp; 26) in shaft (23) . Shaft (24)<br>
has an ordinary twisted pinion (27) . Shaft (23) &amp; (24) is connected by these twisted<br>
round pinion. There is a big round pinion (28) in shaft (24) . This pinion (28) is<br>
connected with a small round pinion (30) in shaft,(29) . Big round pinion (31) of shaft<br>
(29) is connected with a small pinion (33) of the last shaft (32).<br>
Shaft (32) has a wheel (34) . Ten big rods (35) of definite length are located on the circumference of the wheel at definite distance in between them as a perpendicular to the circumference of the wheel. There is a balancer (D).<br>
n<br><br>
Description of Balancer (If):<br>
In fig 12 (b) two plates (.36,37) are situated at definite length being parallel to each other C The lower parts of those plates are connected.There are two rollers( 38,39) on the both sides into the plates. There is a shaft (40) in wheel (38) and shaft (41) in the wheel (39) . The wheel (38) will move freely with the shaft (40) being fixed , on the other hand the wheel (39) will move with the shaft(42)being fixed . Two shafts (42,43 ) are there on the outer side along the middle of the two plates . The balancer (D) will move or swing with the help of shafts (42,43).<br>
There are piston (44), crank (46) , crank shaft (47) , fly wheel (48) . The piston<br>
(44) is connected with the crank (46) by a connecting rod (45) . The figure 12 (C) shows       <br>
that there is a 'U' - shaped hole along the middle-of the body of the piston (44) figure <br>
(13) and fig (7) shows that a wheel (34) connected with 10 rods (35) , balancer (D) and a	<br>
piston (44) are situated at a particular position . The wheel (39) of balancer (D) is placed into the accurately 'U'-shaped hole of piston (44) . When the piston (44) will move up and down , the wheel (39) will also move up and-down but the shafts ( 42,43) of the balancer will remain unmoved . The result is that the wheel (38) situated opposite to the wheel (39) will move down and up . That is when the wheel (39) moves down , the wheel (38) will move up and vice - versa in respect of shafts (42,43 ) . The top of a rod of a wheel (34) of 10 rods in shaft (32) is touched the head of the piston (44) .<br>
In fig (6) , When the piston (7) of gas cylinder (6) is unlocked , the piston will move up. There is a rack (12) on the head of the piston (7) . As a result , there will be displacement of the rack (12) towards arrow mark (49). Partly round pinion (15) attached with the rack (12) will move towards arrow mark (49) and partly round pinion (17) will move towards arrow mark ( 50) . Half round pinion (19) of shaft (20) will also move by the round pinion (18) connected with partly round pinion (17) . Round pinion (22) in shaft (23) connected with big round pinion (21) of shaft (20) will move towards arrow mark (52 )<br>
12<br><br>
Specially twisted pinion (25) of shaft (23) will move with ordinary twisted pinion (27) of shaft (24) . As a result , big round pinion (28) of shaft (24) will move towards arrow mark (53) . Round pinions (30,31) of shaft (29) will move small pinion (33) of shaft (32) and the wheel (34) connected with rod (35) of shaft (32) will move towards arrow mark (54). The result is that the rod ( 35) whose end touched the head of the piston (44) will put pressure on the head of the piston (44) . The piston will move downward . Fig (13) shows that as much the piston (44) will move downward , the end of rod (35) on the head of the piston will also move to the side of the head of the piston . As soon as the piston's downward movement is complete . The end of the rod (35) and the head of the piston will be detached . When the piston (44) will move downward , the wheel (39) of balancer (D) will also move downward . As a result the wheel (38) of balancer (D) will also move upward. When the downward movement of the piston is complete , the end of the rod (35) will be stuck at the wheel (38) . The result is that the wheel (34) of 10 rods (35) will not move further . When the piston comes" down , it has speed . Because of this speed the piston will again move upward . With the piston moving upward , the wheel (39) will also move upward and the wheel (38) will come down . Then the end of the rod (35) will move along the side of the wheel (38). When the upward movement of the piston comes to an end , just then the end of rod (35) will be detached from the wheel (38) , then the wheel (34) of 10 rods will again move . The rod preceding the rod that touched the head of the piston before hand will touch the head of the piston , and will pressurise the piston downward . The same procedure will start. As a result the ends of rod (35) will put pressure on the head of the piston one by one . The piston (44) will move up and down repeatedly . The crank , crank shaft and fly wheel will move again and again. Fig (13) (ii) shows that the wheel of 10 rods and balancer (D) are positioned in such place that the end of the rod that is stuck at the wheel (38) of balancer (D) will go upto half way of the wheel . The end of the rod will not go to the bottom of the wheel (38). If the end of the rod goes to the bottom of the wheel (38) , or to the more than half , or less than half , the system will not move. The radius of wheel (38) of balancer and wheel (39) must be of definite measurement.<br>

Fig (6) shows that the piston (7) of gas cylinder (6) will move upward in unlocked condition because of tremendous pressure . The piston (7) with gas cylinder will move upward once. Then the piston (44) having crank (46) will move up and down repeatedly . As a result crank shaft (47) and fly wheel (48) will move at a great speed. A small portion of the pressure that moved the piston (7) of gas cylinder (6) upward in unlocked condition will exert pressure on the head of the piston (44) by the end of the rod (35). Only then the system will run for longer period . When the upward movement of the piston (7) of gas cylinder in unlocked condition tremendous pressure comes to an end . The system will not move further. Like the winding of watch , the system will be locked by lowering it with the pressure . In this way can wind this system. If the piston (7) of the gas cylinder is unlocked the system will start functioning .<br>
The following sections describe the said mechanical system for two different cases.<br>
Case 1 : The mechanical system runs for a specified time span when the gas cylinder is unlocked . But this does not ensure continuous running of the said system for long hours. The system can be made either in big or in small size. The gas cylinder of a small system will be small and the gas cylinder of a big system will be big . Power of a small system will be less; Whereas the power of a big system will be more.<br>
Suppose the size of a gas cylinder is such that it moves one minute . If a big gas cylinder is used , it will run for a longer time . If a number of small gas cylinders are used , the system will also run for a long time. If a big gas cylinder is used the complexity of the system will be less . But the size of a system will possibly be bigger . Besides , if there is an explosion of the gas cylinder , the loss will be to a great extent. If necessary the system will be operated using big gas cylinder.. If the small cylinders are used , the complexity of the system will increase . But the system will be small in accordance with the power of the system . What is more is that there is no possibility of explosion . the description that follows gives how small gas cylinder can be used in the system.<br>

In fig ( 1) shows two solid metal cylinders like wheel (1) . There are some holds of definite length and definite radius . the holes are situated by the side of the solid cylinder (1) at a particular distance and they are perpendicular to their own axes . The holes are arranged in a particular pattern by the side of the cylinder. They are in twisted way . there is pinion (3) in twisted way on the circumference of the cylinder . The pinion is attached with those holes (2) . There are shafts (4) along the centre of the two cylinder , there is a twisted canal by the side of the shaft (4). If the solid cylinders are moved like wheel with the shaft remaining fixed. Each of the cylinders will move forward like wheel along the shaft. If they are moved in opposite direction , they will go backward. There are piston with gas cylinders in the holes of the cylinders which are like wheel. Suppose these solid cylinders which are attached with piston and gas cylinder are "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"". One of them is No-1 ""Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"" and the other is No-2 ""Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders"" . These two "Cells having barrels for mounting multiple cylinder's are the 1st part of the system . C.B.M.M.C. ( "Cells'having barrels for mounting multiple cylinders") are placed horizontally at a particular distance with parallel to each other.<br>
In fig (7) there are two racks ( 12,56) with holder attached at bottom . One rack (12 ) is standing just above C.B.M.M.C. No.-l in a perpendicular position. The other rack (56) is standing just above the C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 in a perpendicular position . When the rack will come down , the holder (13,57) at the bottom of rack will be stuck at the head of the piston of gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -1 &amp; C.B.M.M.C. No. -2 respectively . Fig (7) Shows that there are two parts with a rod on both side partly round pinion . Partly round pinion (15) of the one side of the rod (16) is connected with the rack (12) . Partly round pinion (17) of the other side of the rod (16) is connected with the round pinion (18). This round pinion (18) is again linked with the half round pinion (19) of the big shaft (20). the rack (56) is connected with the one side of a partly round pinion (60) of rod (59) . Partly round pinion (61) of the other side of the rod (59) is connected with the half round pinion (64) of shaft (20) by round pinion (63).<br>
Two racks (12,56) , two A rod on both side-partly round pinion and round pinion (18,63) are of second part.<br>
15<br><br>
Fig (7) shows that there is a big round pinion (21) of the big shaft (20 ) . The pinion (21) is connected with the next fourth part .Apart from that there are eight partly round pinion ( four each ) and two half round pinion (19,64) on the two sides in the big shaft (20) . A big round pinion ( 21) is situated on the one side of the big shaft (20) . Beside it there is a half round pinion (19). Partly round pinion ( 72,71,70,69,68,67,66,65) are situated in special positions. Half round pinion (64) is situated on the other side of the shaft (20). Half round pinion (19) and half round pinion (64) are situated in the shaft (20) in a way so that half round pinion (19) get half cycle when the shaft (20) moves a full cycle . The rest half cycle get half round pinion (64) . In shaft (20) except big round pinion (21) , each of the half and partly round pinion are equal in radius.<br>
An imaginary line ( x ) is drawn parallel to the shaft ( 20) . Suppose , when the shaft (20) will move once , each half and partly round pinion except the big round pinion (21) of the shaft (20) will touch the imaginary line after certain intervals.<br>
Let us see how and where the pinions are positioned . suppose if the shaft (20) moves once , the first teeth of half round pinion (19) touches the imaginary line in the arrow mark (51) direction just then partly round pinion (68) and 1st teeth of (72) will touch the imaginary line . If the half round pinion (19) passes ? of its half round path ( imaginary line) last teeth of partly round pinion ( 68 &amp; 72) will cross that imaginary line . Then the 1st teeth of the partly round pinion ( 67) will touch that imaginary line. When the half round pinion ( 19) crosses the imaginary line which is the ? of the pinion's half round path , the last teeth of the partly round pinion ( 67) will cross that line . 1st teeth of the partly round pinion (66) will also touch that line . When the half round pinion (19) will cross the imaginary line which is the last ? of the half round path , last teeth of the partly round pinion (66) will cross the imaginary line . The shaft (20) will move half round . This time the 1st teeth of the half round pinion (64) will touch that imaginary line . Just then the 1st teeth of (65 &amp; 69) will touch that imaginary line when the half round pinion ( 64) crosses the first V3 path of its half round path i.e. the imaginary line , last teeth of (65 &amp; 69) will cross that line . Just then 1st teeth of the partly round pinion (70) will touch the imaginary line. When the second ? of the half round path of the half round<br>
16<br><br>
pinion (64) will cross that imaginary line , the last teeth of partly round pinion (70 ) will cross that imaginary line. Then the 1st teeth of the partly round pinion ( 71) will touch that imaginary line. When the half round pinion (64) will cross the imaginary line in its last ? path , last teeth of the partly round pinion (71) will cross that line . The shaft (20) will have its one round. If it moves another round , those pinions will touch the imaginary line in the same way as that at before . So it is clear how the partly round pinion ( 65 ,-66,67,68,69,70,71,72) and half round pinion ( 19,64) are situated . Round pinion ( 18 &amp; 73) , a rod on one side partly round pinion (74) , round pinion ( 76) , round pinion (77) , A rod on one side partly round pinion (78) , round pinion ( 80 &amp; 63) are situated on particular positions on that imaginary line (x ) .      <br>
The automatic system is divided into 3 parts . (1) Group A (2) Group B (3) Group C . Automatic system means how the piston with gas cylinder are being unlocked and are going up one by one . Group A is shown in fig (7) , Round pinion ( 77) on the imaginary line (x ) is connected with partly round pinion (68) , there is a pinion (82) along the edge of the mouth of the cylinder (81) . There is a shaft (183) along the axis of the cylinder (81) . There is also a wheel (84) in the shaft (83) . The wheel (84) and the round pinion (77) are connected by a connecting rod (85). A big round pinion (86) is attached with the pinion (82) of the cylinder (81),. A cylinder (87) is attached with the round pinion (86) in a perpendicular way . It is clear from the fig (7) (A) that there are two teeth after some space on the edge of the mouth of the cylinder(87) . Big round pinion (86) is connected with the twisted pinion (3) of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 . Same part are Connected with round pinion (76) some parts are situated on the imaginary line (x) . They are connected one after another and are finally connected with twisted pinion(3) of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 1.<br>
Group B is shown in fig 7 (B) . In the diagram A rod ( 79) on one side partly pinion (78) is situated at a particular place on the imaginary line (x) . Similarly a rod (75) on one side partly round pinion (74) is situated at another particular place of the imaginary line.<br>
17<br><br>
Another rod (96) is connected with the other side of the fulcrum (95) of rod (79) . The rod (96) is entered into the clamp (97) which is on the arm of the partly round pinion (60) of rod (59) . The rod (75) is connected with the another rod (99) which is on the other side of the fulcrum (98) . This rod (99) is entered into the clamp (100) which is on the arm to the side of the partly round pinion (15) of rod (16).<br>
Group C is shown in fig 7 (C). The fig shows that there is a round pinion (80) on the imaginary line x . The round pinion (80) is attached with the wheel ( 103) by the connecting rod (102) . A rack (104) is attached with this wheel (103) . The piston of the gas cylinder C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 is unlocked by the rack (104) moving the round pinion (58) which is attached with the holder (57).<br>
In the picture there is also a similar round pinion (73) positioned in another place of the imaginary line . Round pinion (73) is connected with the wheel (106) by the connected rod (105) . A rack (107) is attached with this wheel. with the help of this rack (107) the piston of gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 1 is unlocked when the round pinion (14) attached with the holder (13) is moved. ,<br>
In fig 7 (C) there is pinion in the half- circle of wheel (103) &amp; wheel (106) . The two wheels are connected with each other by a rod ( 110) on both side partly round pinion (111 &amp; 112).<br>
Functions Group A , Group B &amp; Group C :<br>
Group A : Fig - 7(A) shows that when the piston with the gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C.<br>
No. - 1 is unlocked , the piston will start to move upward .there will be upward<br>
displacement of definite length . As a result there will be displacement of the rack (12) in<br>
the upward direction . Half round pinion (19) in shaft (20) will move half round along<br>
with shaft (20) in the direction of arrow mark (51) by some pinions connected with rack<br>
(12).<br>
13<br><br>
When the half round pinion will move ? of its path , partly round pinion (68) of shaft (20) with round pinion (77) and other parts attached with it will help C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 to move towards the arrow mark (113) particular parts of the circle.<br>
Group B : From fig 7 (B) we get, when the half round pinion (19) moves the second ? of its total path partly round pinion (67) of shaft (20) will lower the arm of rod ( 59) which is on the side where the partly round pinion (60) of a rod ( 59) on both side partly pinion (60,61) with the help of a rod on one side partly round pinion (78) and other parts. As a result the holder (57) of rack (56) will be stuck on the head of the piston which is attached with the gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. --2.<br>
Group C : From fig 7 (C) we get when the half round pinion ( 19) moves last ? of its path , the partly round pinion (66) of shaft (20) will replace the rack (104) towards the arrow mark (115) with the help of the round pinion (80) and other parts . The result is that the round pinion (58) which is attached with the rack (104) and holder (57) will move towards the arrow mark (115). Moreover the piston attached with a gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No- 2 will be unlocked.<br>
When the rack (104) unlocks the piston attached with the gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No-2 the rack (104) will have to come to the previous position which was before the piston of the gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 was unlocked . For this purpose , the wheels ( 103 &amp; 106) are connected by rod (110) on both side partly round pinion ( 111 ,112) [ in fig 7 (C) ] Because of this inter connection the rack (104 ) will be able to come to its former position to unlock the piston after unlocking of the preceding piston of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 . Similarly , when the piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 is unlocked the piston will go upward . The rack (56) will also go upward and it will help to move half round pinion (64) of shaft (20) towards arrow mark (51) by some pinions . The result is that the some function will be done on C.B.M.M.C. No. - 1 by partly round pinion ( 69,70,71) of shaft (20) . Functions of Group A are shown in fig 7 (A) . The function is to move C.B.M.M.C. No. - 1 upto a definite parts of the circle towards the arrow mark (114) by the round pinion (76) attached with the partly<br>
19<br><br>
round pinion (69) and other parts. In this way , the piston with gas cylinder will reach at the bottom of the rack (12) . When the big round pinion is busy to move C.B.M.M.C. No-1 upto definite parts of circle . Within a particular time of that time two teeth will help to move the round pinion (14) situated at the holder (13) upto a particular parts of the circle towards the arrow mark ( 137) . Here and there are two teeth on the edge of the cylinder (94) of big round pinion (93).<br>
In this way , the holder (13) of rack (12) is stuck coming down on the head of the piston of gas cylinder in same same position . the function of Group B in C.B.M.M.C.  No. -1 is same that of C.B.M.M.C. No. -2 . That is to lower the arm which is on the side of partly round pinion (15) of rod (16) by rod (99) and partly pinion (70) the rod (75) on one side pinion (74) . In this way the holder (13) of rack (12) is stuck on the head of the piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -1.<br>
The function of Group C in C.B.M.M.C. No. -1 is same that of above of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 2 . That is to unlock the piston of the second gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -1 by round pinion (73) attached with the partly round pinion (71) and by other parts.<br>
Case 2 : As soon as the gas cylinder is unlocked the piston attached to the said cylinder will receive a heavy upward thrust. The amount of pressure or thrust will be lesser gradually when the said piston moves in upward direction. Apparently , it may appear that the motion of the final output shaft may not be uniform always. Fig (7) &amp; fig (9) shows that the solution is done by the twisted pinion of shaft (23,24) of fourth part. There are two specially twisted pinions opposite to each other in the shaft (23) . When the shaft moves one round , the twisted pinion(25) gets half round and the twisted pinion(26) gets the rest half. There is an ordinary twisted pinion (27) in shaft (24) . The perpendicular distance from the own axis of the shaft(24) upto the each teeth of the twisted pinions(27) is equal.<br>
Specially twisted pinion of shaft (23) is attached with the twisted pinion(27) of shaft(24). If any of those two shafts are moved , the other will also move . The radius of the shaft (24) is such that with half round rotation of shaft (23) means one round rotation of shaft(24) , The round pinion(22) of shaft (23) is of so measurement that<br>
20<br><br>
when the piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. - 1 is unlocked it will come up . The big round pinion will rotate half round . As a result the shaft (23) will rotate half round because of the piston of the gas cylinder . That is a specially twisted pinion (25) will help to rotate the twisted pinion (27) of shaft (24) a full round . For this a special pinion in shaft (23) is necessary for the piston with gas cylinder . However big or small the piston with gas cylinder may be and how much or less time is the system operated a specially twisted pinion in shaft (23) is enough . This shaft (23) will rotate only half round . However , big gas cylinder required big parts of the system . If two   or more gas cylinder are used , there must be two twisted pinion in shaft (23) . The unequal pressure of the piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -1 exert equal pressure in shaft (24) by a specially twisted pinion of shaft (23 ) and an ordinary twisted pinion of shaft (24) . Big round pinion (28) of shaft (24) is exerting equal pressure on the next pinion . As a result , the end of the rod (35) of the wheel will apply equal pressure always on the head of the piston attached with the crank of the system . Similarly unequal pressure of the piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -2 exert equal pressure in shaft (24) by a specially twisted pinion (26) of shaft (23) and an ordinary twisted pinion of shaft (24).<br>
Description of the specially twisted pinions (25,26) of shaft (23)<br>
In fig (6) , (7) &amp; (9) shows that the perpendicular distance of the 1st tooth of specially twisted pinion (25,26) in respect of the own axis (y) of shaft (23) is of definite measurement and equal. They are on the opposite sides to each other on specially twisted pinions ( 25,26) of shaft (23) . The perpendicular distance of the tooth next to the specially twisted piston (25,26) with respect to the own axis (y) of the shaft (23) will gradually decrease . The perpendicular distance of the last tooth in comparison with that of the 1st in respect of the axis y is less to a great extent. But the perpendicular distance of the last tooth of each of the specially twisted pinions in respect of the axis (y) is same . They are located in the same place of shaft (23) but on the opposite side of it. How less the perpendicular distance of the last tooth in comparison with that of the first one in respect of the axis y be will depend on how less pressure will the piston of the gas cylinder feel while going upwards in unlocked condition . In fig (11) we see that there is<br>
21<br><br>
a big pinion and small pinion in each shaft . A big pinion of a shaft is connected with a small pinion of another shaft. These may be used between the 4th &amp; 5th parts when necessary.<br>
This mechanical system can be refuelled like the winding of the watch . That is energy which brings down the unlocked pistons of the gas cylinder again and locked them.<br>
Big round pinion (28) of shaft (24) of the 4th part is connected with the small round pinion (30) of shaft (29) . The shaft (29) is made bigger slightly in length . The direction , in which the shaft was moving while the system is on , is opposite when the system is given energy . This moving in the opposite direction can be done either by manually or by motor. But this should be according to the capacity of the system . If a big gas cylinder that will help to operate the system for much time according to the need is used and if it is moved in the opposite direction ( fig 6) the piston of the gas cylinder will come down. The piston can be locked to the holder (13) by round pinion (14) . If piston with many gas cylinders are used . The system will like the fig (7) . Then the piston will come down one by one and will be locked with the help of the semi automatic system . This means the system will move to the opposite starting of the system .<br>
In fig (8) it is shown that there are two handles (118 , 126) . There are wheels under the each handle (119,117) respectively . The wheel (119) is attached with the wheel ( 121) by the connecting rod (120) . There is a bent connecting rod (122) in the wheel (121). Another end of the connecting rod (122) is attached specially with the shaft (123) of the round pinion (73) . If the handle is moved towards the arrow mark (136) . There will be displacement of the connecting rod (122) by the wheel (121) towards the arrow mark (125) . When the handle (118) is moved towards the direction opposite to the arrow mark (136) , there will be the displacement of the connecting rod (122) towards the arrow mark (124) . The round pinion (73) of shaft (123) will be displaced towards the arrow mark (124) along the shaft (123) . In the previous case , There will be a displacement of the round pinion (73) of shaft (123) towards the arrow mark (125) along the shaft (123)<br>
22<br><br>
Similarly , if the handle (126) is moved towards the arrow mark (131) or towards the opposite direction with the help of the wheel (117) attached with the handle (126) connecting rod (127) , the wheel (128) , the bent connecting rod (129) will move the pinion (80) of shaft (130) towards the arrow mark (132) or opposite direction respectively along the shaft (130) . During the winding of the system the handle (118) will move towards the arrow mark (136) and the handle (.126) will move towards the arrow mark (131).<br>
In fig (8) the handles (118 &amp; 126) are shown displaced towards the arrow mark (136 ,131) respectively.<br>
As a result , Partly round pinion (71 &amp; 66) of shaft (20) will move false . But partly round pinion (72 &amp; 65) will now be effective . With the single rotation of it in shaft (20) after particular time partly round piniorr(72) will be connected with the round pinion (73) and partly round pinion (65) will be connected with the round pinion (80).<br>
Now the semi automatic system will work reversely in comparison with way the system worked when it was winding . A piston with gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -2 will come down and during the end of that time partly round pinion will be connected with the round pinion (80) . The result is that the connecting rod (102) will try to move in the direction of the arrow mark (133) . But until the head of the piston and the lock system of the gas cylinder do not come to the same level, the whole connecting rod (102) will not move in the direction of the arrow mark (133) . There is a spring (134) in the middle of the connecting rod (102) . The arm of the connecting rod (102) from the spring (134) to the round pinion (80) will be displaced in the direction of the arrow mark (133) with the spring (134) . As a result the spring (134) will be extended . With the piston coming down , when the head of the piston and gas cylinder will reach to the same level, the piston will be locked because of the pull of the spring (134) . In the same way there is a spring (135) in the connecting rod (105) . Just after the piston of the gas cylinder is locked , the piston of the gas cylinder of C.B.MM.C. No. -1 will be locked by the connecting rod (105) and the round pinion (73) attached with the partly round pinion (72) of shaft (20) and other parts . When all the pistons of gas cylinder of C.B.M.M.C. No. -1<br>
2t<br><br>
&amp; C.B.M.M.C. No -2 are locked the winding of the system is complete . That is to supply energy to the system is complete. The system can be started when necessary.<br>
Measurement of System Parts and Analysis of Energy uses in the System<br>
Now if use a big gas cylinder in this rotating system, when this rotating system will be winded them 10% energy will be lost for the friction of parts and others problem. And when it will be rotating then 10% energy will be lost for friction of parts. Last 80% energy will come as output for rotation this rotating system. Now again if use many gas cylinder instead of one gas cylinder , when this rotating system will be charged then 6% energy will lost for friction of parts and other problem. And when this rotating system will be rotating then 10% energy will be lost for friction of parts. By automatic system in system 5% energy is lost for running . Last 79% energy will come as output for rotation this rotating system.<br>
This mechanical system has different hrs power. Such as less than one hrs power or more than one hrs power of the system is made . This mechanical system is made in such way that it will be running for short time or long time . The rotating system may be small in shape or big in shape which depend on rotating time &amp; hrs power<br>
Here the measurement of system parts and analysis of energy of this one type invented rotating system is given .<br>
The volume of gas cylinder is 15 ml .The radius of gas cylinder is .32" , The length of gas cylinder is 3". 5000 ml air is converted into 15 ml inside the cylinder by giving tremendous pressure by compressor system . Tremendous pressure need to bring down 1" length the piston of cylinder into the cylinder . Now the volume of air inside the gas cylinder (6) with piston is 10 ml. When the piston (7) is unlocked just then piston feels a tremendous pressure .

When the piston will be unlocked then the piston will move upward due to pressurised air with a fixed length . Between these two power supplying system the cell from first power supplying system will be unlocked and power will be feeded. After that the cell from the second power supplying system will be unlocked and feed power similarly . And then second cell of first power supplying system will come in action and then second power supplying system come in action and the system will continue using the cell for the two power supplying system. When the piston will be unlocked there will be a deferential pressure . Because during the unlocking of piston the pressure is more and when the unlocking is over, then pressure is less . These deferential pressure will be converted into equal pressure by help of a special gear. This equal pressure produce rotation with the help of crank and piston arrangement.<br><br>
