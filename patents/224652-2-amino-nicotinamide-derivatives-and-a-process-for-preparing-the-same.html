The invention relates to   2-amino-nicotinamide derivatives alone or in combination with one or more other pharmaceuticallyctive compounds for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use for therapy of a disease which responds to an inhibition of the VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, especially a neoplastic disease, retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration; a method for the treatment of such a disease in animals, especially in humans; new 2-amino-nicotinamide derivatives and processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
Certain diseases are known to be associated with deregulated angiogenesis, for example diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, such as retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, haemangiobfastoma, haeman-gioma, endometriosis, and especially neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors and liquid tumors (such as leukemias).<br>
According to recent findings, at the centre of the network regulating the growth and differen¬tiation of the vascular system and its components, both during embryonic development and normal growth and in a wide number of pathological anomalies and diseases, lies the angio¬genic factor known as "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor" (= VGEF; originally termed "Vascular Permeability Factor",» VPF), along with its cellular receptors (see Breier, G., et al., Trends in Cell Biology 6,454-6 [1996] and references cited therein).<br>
VEGF is a dimeric, disulfide-linked 46-kDa glycoprotein produced by normal cell lines and tumor cell lines. It is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, shows angiogenic activity in In vivo test systems (e.g. rabbit cornea), is chemotactic for endothelial cells and monocytes, and induces plasminogen activators In endothelial cells, which are then involved in the pro¬teolytic degradation of extracellular matrix during the formation of capillaries. A number of isoforms of VEGF are known, which show comparable biological activity, but differ in the type of cells that secrete them and in their heparin-binding capacity. In addition, there are other members of the VEGF family, such as "Placenta Growth Factor" (PLGF) and VEGF-C.<br><br>
VEGF receptors are transmembranous receptor tyrosine kinases. They are characterized by an extracellular domain with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular tyrosi¬ne kinase domain. Various types of VEGF receptor are known, e.g. VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3.<br>
A large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells could stimulate the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothe¬lium in a paracrine manner and thus, through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor growth. Increased VEGF expression could explain the occurrence of cerebral oedema in patients with glioma. Direct evidence of the role of VEGF as a tumor angiogenesis factor in vivo has been obtained from studies in which VEGF expression or VEGF activity was inhibi¬ted. This was achieved with antibodies which inhibit VEGF activity, with dominant-negative VEGFR-2 mutants which inhibited signal transduction, or with the use of antisense-VEGF RNA techniques. All approaches led to a reduction in the growth of glioma cell lines or other tumor cell lines in vivo as a result of inhibited tumor angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for those tumors which grow beyond a maximum diameter of about 1-2 mm; up to this limit, oxygen and nutrients may be sup¬plied to the tumor cells by diffusion. Every tumor, regardless of its origin and its cause, is thus dependent on angiogenesis for its growth after it has reached a certain size.<br>
Three principal mechanisms play an important part in the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors against tumors: 1) Inhibition of the growth of vessels, (especially capillaries, into avascular resting tumors, with the result that there is no net tumor growth owing to the balance that is achieved between apoptosis and proliferation; 2) Prevention of the migration of tumor cells owing to the absence of blood flow to and from tumors; and 3) Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, thus avoiding the paracrine growth-stimulating effect exerted on the surroun¬ding tissue by the endothelial cells which normally line the vessels.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that nicotinamide derivatives of formula I, described be¬low, are a new class of compounds that have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit, for example, the activity of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, the growth of<br><br>
tumors and VEGF-dependent cell proliferation, and the other diseases mentioned above and below.<br>
The compounds of formula I open up, for example, an unexpected new therapeutic ap¬proach, especially for diseases in the treatment of which, and also for the prevention of which, an inhibition of angiogenesis and/or of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase shows beneficial effects.<br>

When a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule, a compound of formula 1 may also form internal salts.<br>
For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unaccept¬able salts, for example picrates or perchlorates. For therapeutic use, only pharmaceutically acceptable salts or free compounds are employed (where applicable in the form of pharma¬ceutical preparations), and these are therefore preferred.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and those in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, any reference to the free com¬pounds hereinbefore and hereinafter is to be understood as referring also to the correspon¬ding salts, as appropriate and expedient.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and N-oxides thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, as described hereinbefore and hereinafter.<br>
The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated as follows:<br>
Test for activity against VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The test is conducted using Flt-1 VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The detailed procedure is as follows: 30 u.l kinase solution (10 ng of the kinase domain of Flt-1, Shibuya et al., Oncogene 5, 519-24 [1990]) in 20 mM Tris»HCI pH 7.5, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCI2), 3 mM magnesium chloride (MgCI2), 10 uM sodium vanadate, 0.25 mg/ml polyethylenglycol (PEG) 20000,1mM dithiothreitol and 3 ug/ul poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 8 uM [^PJ-ATP (0.2 uCi), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0 to 100 uM of the compound to be tested are incubated together for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is then terminated by the addition of 10 ul 0.25 M ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) pH 7. Using a multichannel dispenser (LAB SYSTEMS, USA), an aliquot of 20 ul is applied to a PVDF (= polyvinyl difluoride) Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, USA), through a Gibco-BRL microtiter filter manifold and connected to a vacuum. Following complete elimination of the liquid, the membrane is washed 4 times successively in a bath containing 0.5% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and once with ethanol, incubated for 10 minutes each time while shaking, then mounted in a Hewlett Packard TopCount Manifold and the radioactivity measured after the addition of 10 pi Microscint® (B-scintillation counter liquid). ICso-values are determined by linear regression analysis of the percentages for the inhibition of each compound in three concentrations (as a rule 0.01, 0.1, and 1 umol). The ICso-values that can be found with compounds of formula I are in the range of 1 to 1000 nM, preferably in the range of 1 to 100 nM.<br>
The antitumor efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be demonstrated in vivo as follows: ^<br>
In vivo activity in the nude mouse xenotransplant model: female BALB/c nude mice (8-12 weeks old), Novartis Animal Farm, Sisseln, Switzerland) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed ad libitum. Tumors are induced either by subcutaneous injection of<br><br>
tumor cells into mice (for example, Du 145 prostate carcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 81; see Cancer Research 37, 4049-58 (1978)) or by implanting tumor fragments (about 25 mg) subcutaneously into the left flank of mice using a 13-gauge trocar needle under Forene® anaesthesia (Abbott, Switzerland). Treatment with the test compound is started as soon as the tumor has reached a mean volume of 100 mm3. Tumor growth is measured two to three times a week and 24 hours after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpen¬dicular axes. The tumor volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et al., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8 [1982]). The antitumor efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tu¬mor volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as T/C%. Tumor regression (given in %) is reported as the smallest mean tumor volume in relation to the mean tumor volume at the start of treatment. The test compound is admini¬stered daily by gavage.<br>

The inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor autophosphorylation can be confirmed with a further in vitro experiment in cells: transfected CHO cells, which permanently express human VEGF receptor (KDR), are seeded in complete culture medium (with 10% fetal calf serum = FCS) in 6-well cell-culture plates and incubated at 37°C under 5% CO* until they show about<br><br>
80% confluency. The compounds to be tested are then diluted in culture medium (without FCS, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and added to the cells. (Controls comprise medium without test compounds). After two hours of incubation at 37°C, recombinant VEGF is added; the final VEGF concentration is 20 ng/ml). After a further five minute incubation at 37°C, the cells are washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and immediately lysed in 100 pi lysis buffer per well. The lysates are then centrifuged to remove the cell nuclei, and the protein concentrations of the supematants are determined using a commercial protein assay (BIORAD). The lysates can then either be immediately used or, if necessary, stored at -20°C.<br>
A sandwich ELISA is earned out to measure the KDR-receptor phosphorylation: a monoclonal antibody to KDR (for example Mab 1495.12.14; prepared by H. Towbin) is immobilized on black ELISA plates (OptiPlate™ HTRF-96 from Packard). The plates are then washed and the remaining free protein-binding sites are saturated with 1% BSA in PBS. The cell lysates (20 ug protein per well) are then incubated in these plates overnight at 4°C together with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (PY20.-AP from Transduction Laboratories). The (plates are washed again and the) binding of the antiphosphotyrosine antibody to the captured phosphorylated receptor is then demonstrated using a luminescent AP substrate (CDP-Star, ready to use, with Emerald II; TROPIX). The luminescence is measured in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). The difference between the signal of the positive control (stimulated with VEGF) and that of the negative control (not stimulated with VEGF) corresponds to VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation (= 100 %). The activity of the tested substances is calculated as % inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation, wherein the concentration of substance that induces half the maximum inhibition is defined as the ED50 (effective dose for 50% inhibition). Compounds of formula I here preferably show ED50 values in the range of 0.25 nM to 1000 nM, preferably 0.25 to 250 nM.<br>
A compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof inhibits to varying degrees also other tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction which are mediated by trophic factors, for example Abl kinase, kinases from the Src family, especially c-Src kinase, Lck, and Fyn; also kinases of the EGF family, for example, c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), c-erbB3 kinase, c-erbB4 kinase; insulin-like growth factor receptor kinase (IGF-1 kinase), especially members of the PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase family, such as PDGF-receptor kinase, CSF-1-receptor kinase, Kit-receptor kinase and VEGF-receptor kinase; and also serine/threonine kinases, all of which<br><br>
On the basis of their efficacy as inhibitors of VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, the compounds of the formula I primarily inhibit the growth of blood vessels and are thus, for example, effective against a number of diseases associated with deregulated angiogenesis, especially diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macula degeneration, psoriasis, haemangioblastoma, such as haemangioma, mesangial cell proliferative disorders, such as chronic or acute renal diseases, e.g. diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangio¬pathy syndromes or transplant rejection, or especially inflammatory renal disease, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, endometriosis, chronic asthma, and especially neoplastic diseases (solid tumors, but also leukemias and other "liquid tumors", especially those expressing c-kit, KDR, fit-"! or Flt-3), such as especially breast cancer, cancer of the colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), cancer of the prostate or Kaposi's sarcoma. A compound of formula I (or an N-oxide thereof) inhibits the growth of tumours and is especially suited to preventing the metastatic spread of tumors and the growth of micrometastases.<br>
A compound of formula I can be administered alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, possible combination therapy taking the form of fixed combinati¬ons or the administration of a compound of the invention and one or more other therapeutic agents being staggered or given independently of one another, or the combined admini¬stration of fixed combinations and one or more other therapeutic agents. A compound of formula I can besides or in addition be administered especially for tumor therapy in com¬bination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical intervention, or a com¬bination of these. Long-term therapy is equally possible as is adjuvant therapy in the con¬text of other treatment strategies, as described above. Other possible treatments are thera¬py to maintain the patient's status after tumor regression, or even chemopreventive therapy, for example in patients at risk.<br>
Therapeutic agents for possible combination are especially one or more cytostatic or cyto¬toxic compounds, for example a chemotherapeutic agent or several selected from the group comprising an inhibitor of poiyamine biosynthesis, an inhibitor of protein kinase, especially of serine/threonine protein kinase, such as protein kinase C, or of tyrosine protein kinase,<br><br>
such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, a cytokine, a negative growth re¬gulator, such as TGF-R or IFN-13, an aromatase inhibitor, a classical cytostatic, and an inhi¬bitor of the interaction of an SH2 domain with a phosphorylated protein.<br>
A compound according to the invention is not only for the (prophylactic and preferably the¬rapeutic) management of humans, but also for the treatment of other warm-blooded ani¬mals, for example of commercially useful animals, for example rodents, such as mice, rab¬bits or rats, or guinea-pigs. Such a compound may also be used as a reference standard in the test systems described above to permit a comparison with other compounds.<br>
In general, the invention relates also to the use of a compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof for the inhibition of VEGF-receptor tyrosine activity, either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
A compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof may also be used for diagnostic purposes, for example with tumors that have been obtained from warm-blooded animal "hosts", especially humans, and implanted into mice to test them for decreases in growth after treatment with such a compound, in order to investigate their sensitivity to the said compound and thus to improve the detection and determination of possible therapeutic methods for neoplastic diseases in the original host.<br>

wherein X, n, R and R' are as defined for a compound of the formula I in the presence of a reducing agent. The carbonyl compound of the formula V may also be present in the form of reactive derivative; however, the free aldehyde or ketone is preferred. Reactive derivatives of the compounds of formula V are, for example, corresponding bisulfite adducts or especially semiacetals, acetals, semiketals or ketals of compounds of formula V with alcohols, for example lower alkanols; or thioacetals or thioketals of compounds of formula V with mercaptans, for example lower alkanesulfides.<br>
The reductive alkylation is preferably carried out with hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, especially a noble metal catalyst, such as platinum or especially palladium, which is preferably bonded to a carrier material, such as carbon, or a heavy metal catalyst, such as Raney nickel, at normal pressure or at pressures of from 0.1 to 10 MegaPascal (MPa), or<br><br>
With reduction by means of complex hydrides, such as borohydrides, especially alkali metal cWioborohydrides, for example sodium cyanoborohydride, in the presence of a suitable acid, preferably relatively weak acids, such as lower alkanecarboxylic acids, especially acetic acid, or a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; in customary solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or ethers, for example cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence or absence of water.<br>
Detailed description of the process:<br>
In the more detailed description of the process below R1f R2, R3, R, R\ X, W and n are as defined for compounds of formula I, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The reaction of compounds of formula II and III is preferably carried out in a polar solvent, for example in alcohols, e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 3-ethyl-3-pentanol, in dimethylacetamide-, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone and preferably under an inert atmosphere, for example under a nitrogen or an argon atmosphere. The base that is used in the reaction can be selected from customary bases, such as potassium carbonate, caesium carbonate or an organic base such as a tretiary amine, such as ethyldiisopropyl-amine, or an aromatic amine such as pyridine, or in the presence of an excess of the reagent of formula III. Good results were obtained with potassium carbonate. The reaction is catalysed by copper ion catalysts or nickel salts. Preferably, copper(l)oxide or coppers-iodide is used as the catalyst. The compounds are preferably reacted between 0.5 and 24 hours, e.g. 120 minutes, between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. If dimethylformamide is chosen as the solvent for the reaction, the temperature is e.g. preferably in the range of 80 °C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Protecting groups<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, are or need to be protected in a compound of formulae II, III and/or IV, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br><br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the func¬tional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etheri-fications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reac¬tions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not pre¬sent in the end-products.The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.<br>
The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W*. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley, New York 1981, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" {Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" (Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention a compound of formula I comprising a 2-methoxypyridyl radical is transferred into a compound of formula I comprising a 2-hydroxypyridyl radical by treatment with trimethylsilyl iodide for about 20 to 35 hours at a temperature between 45 °C and 70 °C in a suitable solvent, e.g. a halogenated alkane, like chloroform, optionally followed by treatment with methanol.<br>
Additional process steps<br>
In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned here¬inabove under "protecting groups". The protecting groups are then wholly or party removed<br><br>
according to one of the methods described there.<br>
Salts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. A salt with two acid mo¬lecules (for example a dihalogenide of a compound of formula I) may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound (for example a monohalogenide); this may be done by heating to a melt, or for example by heating as a solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature, for example from 130 to 170°C, one molecule of the acid being ex¬pelled per molecule of a compound of formula I.<br>
Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corres¬ponding isomers in a manner known perse by means of suitable separation methods. Dia-stereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar pro¬cedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of dia-stereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
A compound of formula I, wherein W is O, can be converted into the respective compound wherein W is S, for example, by using an appropriate sulfur compound, e.g. using reaction with Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)2,4-dithioxo-1,2,3,4-dithiaphosphetan) in a halogenated carbon hydrate, such as dichloromethane, or an aprotic solvent, such as toluene or xylene, at temperatures from about 30 °C to reflux.<br>
A compound of the formula I wherein Ri is hydrogen can be converted to the respective compound wherein Ri is lower alkyl by reaction e.g. with a diazo lower alkyl compound, especially diazomethane, in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of a noble metal<br><br>
catalyst, especially in dispersed form, e.g. copper, or a noble metal salt, e.g. coppers-chloride orcopper(ll)-sulfate. Also reaction with lower alkylhalogenides is possible, or with other leaving group carrying lower alkanes, e.g. lower alkyl alcohols esterified by a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as a lower alkane sulfonic acid (optionally substituted by halogen, such as fluoro), an aromatic sulfonic acid, for example unsubstituted or substituted benzene-sulfonic acid, the substituents preferably being selected from lower alkyl, such as methyl, halogen, such as bromo, and/or nitro, e.g. esterified by methane sulfonic acid, tri-methane sulfonic acid or p-toluol sulfonic acid. The alkylation takes place especially in aqueous solution and/or in the presence of polar solvents, typically alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or ethylene glycol, ethers, typically dioxane, amides, typically dimethylformamide, or phenols, typically phenol, and also under non-aqueous conditions, in non-polar solvents, typically benzene and toluene, or in benzene/water emulsions, where applicable in the presence of acidic or basic catalysts, for example leaches, typically sodium hydroxide solution, or in the presence of solid-phase catalysts, typically aluminium oxide, that have been doped with hydrazine, in ethers, for example diethylether, generally at temperatures from about 0°C to the boiling temperature of the corresponding reaction mixture, preferably between 20°C and reflux temperature, if necessary under increased pressure, e.g. in a sealed tube, a temperature in excess of boiling point also being possible, and/or under inert gas, typically nitrogen or argon.<br>
It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.<br>
General process conditions<br>
All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, pre¬ferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralisiing agents, for example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the H+ form, de¬pending on the type of reaction and/or reactants at reduced, normal, or elevated tempera¬ture, for example in the range from -100°C to about 190°C, preferably from about -80°C to about 150°C, for example at -80 to -60°C, at room temperature, at - 20 to 40°C or at the boi¬ling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where ap-<br><br>
propriate under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under argon or nitro¬gen.<br>
Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients, if these contain salt-forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds, provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.<br>
At all reaction stages, isomeric mixtures that occur can be separated into their individual isomers, e.g. diastereomers or enantiomers, or into any mixtures of isomers, e.g. racemates or diastereomeric mixtures, typically as described under "Additional process steps".<br>
In certain cases, typically in hydrogenation processes, it is possible to achieve stereose¬lective reactions, allowing for example easier recovery of individual isomers.<br>
The solvents from which those can be selected which are suitable for the reaction in ques¬tion include for example water, esters, typically lower alkyl-lower alkanoates, e.g diethyl acetate, ethers, typically aliphatic ethers, e.g. diethylether, or cyclic ethers, e.g. tetrahydro-furan, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, typically benzene or toluene, alcohols, typically metha¬nol, ethanol or 1- or 2-propanol, nitriles, typically acetonitrile, halogenated hydrocarbons, typically dichloromethane, acid amides, typically dimethylformamide, bases, typically hetero¬cyclic nitrogen bases, e.g. pyridine, carboxylic acids, typically lower alkanecarboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid, carboxylic acid anhydrides, typically lower alkane acid anhydrides, e.g. ace¬tic anhydride, cyclic, linear, or branched hydrocarbons, typically cyclohexane, hexane, or isopentane, or mixtures of these solvents, e.g. aqueous solutions, unless otherwise stated in the description of the process. Such solvent mixtures may also be used in processing, for example through chromatography or distribution.<br>

Suspensions in oil comprise as the oil component the vegetable, synthetic, or semi-synthe¬tic oils customary for injection purposes. In respect of such, special mention may be made of liquid fatty acid esters that contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid ha¬ving from 8 to 22, especially from 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoleic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, B-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene.
