1.        STABILIZER COMPOSITION FOR COLORED HALOGEN-CONTAINING THERMOPLASTIC RESIN COMPOSITIONS<br>
2.<br>
(A)	BAERLOCHER GmbH<br>
(B)	GERMAN<br>
(C)	Freisinger Str.l, 85716 Unterschleissheim,<br>
          Germany.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The invention relates to a stabilizer composition which comprises at least one calcium salt and also one dye or one pigment or both for weathering-resistant thermoplastic resin compositions, in particular for weathering-resistant colored resin compositions based on polyvinyl chloride - (PVC) - where the composition has low content of b-diketones or is in essence free from b-diketones.<br>
Halogen-containing polymers are subject to a wide variety of chemical degradation reactions induced through use or by the environment, for example due to exposure to electromagnetic radiation or to heat or to combinations of two or more external effects, which can lead to disadvantageous impairment of performance characteristics or even to problems during processing. Degradation of halogenated polymers, in particular of PVC, often produces hydrochloric acid, which is eliminated from the polymer chain, the result being a discolored, unsaturated plastic with colorant polyene sequences.<br>
A factor with particularly problematic effect here is that halogen-containing polymers require a relatively high processing temperature before they have the rheological parameters needed for processing. However, even at these temperatures marked decomposition of the polymer takes place in the case of unstabilized polymers, and this results not only in the undesired color change described above but also in a change in the properties of the material. Furthermore, the hydrochloric acid released from unstabilized, halogen-containing polymers at this processing temperature can lead to noticeable corrosion of processing plant. This phenomenon is significant particularly when production stoppages occur during processing of these halogenated polymers to give moldings, for example via extrusion, and the polymer melt remains in the extruder for a prolonged period. The abovementioned decomposition reactions can particularly occur during this period, making the batch within the extruder unusable and sometimes damaging the extruder.<br>
In order to solve the problems mentioned, compounds known as stabilizers are usually added to halogen-containing polymers for processing purposes, these being intended to provide maximum inhibition of the abovementioned decomposition reactions. These<br>
2<br><br>
stabilizers are generally solids which are added to the polymer intended for processing, before it is processed.<br>
The use of calcium hydroxide as stabilizer for PVC is described by way of example in DE 29 35 689 Al. EP 0 394 547 Bl discloses the combination of overbased alkaline earth metal carboxylates with zeolite, with calcium hydroxide and with perchlorates.<br>
WO 99/55777 describes a stabilizer composition for halogen-containing thermoplastic resin compositions. According to that publication, a mixture composed of optionally surface-modified calcium hydroxide and/or calcium oxide and of an isocyanurate containing hydroxy groups is proposed for stabilization.<br>
Processing aids are generally indispensible for the controlled adjustment of properties during and after the processing of halogen-containing thermoplastic polymers. Issues attracting the attention of the processing industry are not only that the costs of these processing aids are often considerable but also that the overall property profile of a halogen-containing thermoplastic polymer is affected by stabilizers and processing aids. Stabilizers demanded for the processing of halogen-containing polymers are therefore increasingly those which bring about excellent processing properties together with stability appropriate to the particular requirements even when the amounts used are small. The prior art often proposes the use of p-diketones as a measure for improving the stabilizing properties of stabilizer compositions used for the stabilization of halogen-containing polymers.<br>
By way of example, DE 694 29 805 T2 describes the use of P-diketones as stabilizers for halogen-containing polymers. Other publications which describe the use of compounds of that type for the stabilization of halogen-containing polymers are US 5,475,145, EP 0 346 279 Al or EP 0 307 358 Al, for example.<br>
By way of example, the German patent application No. 10352762.1, unpublished at the<br>
priority date of the present invention, is concerned with the action of b-diketones in<br>
stabilizer compositions.<br>
3<br><br>
From the overall prior art it is apparent that the use of p-diketones as a constituent of stabilizer compositions has been recommended on grounds of improving thermal stability.<br>
Surprisingly, however, the presence of b-diketones in stabilizer compositions for halogen-containing polymers has a problematic effect in the case of colored halogen-containing polymers, i.e. in the case of polymer compositions which comprise dyes or pigments or both.<br>
Materials composed of colored halogen-containing polymers are mainly used in the outdoor sector. Because of this, these materials are often in direct contact with environmental effects. Among these are in particular severe temperature variations, high-energy radiation, mechanical stress and the like. Particularly when the materials composed of halogen-containing polymers have been arranged so as to be visible, esthetic reasons frequently make it important that the external appearance of the material is not altered or is not altered more than necessary even during prolonged weathering. Colored halogen-containing polymers often show bleaching of the material after prolonged weathering. A generally undesirable esthetic impairment of the component manufactured from this type of material when exposed to weathering of this type is also accompanied by impairment of mechanical stability. It has hitherto been accepted that when stabilizer compositions known from the prior art are used, bleaching of the material usually starts after a period of about 1000 h of artificial weathering. Surprisingly, this time can be observed in almost identical manner not only with frequently-used lead formulations but also with relatively new calcium-zinc-based formulations. Complete surface bleaching then takes place within a further period of up to about 500 h with the abovementioned formulations.<br>
These alterations in the polymeric structure of this type of component lead to a wide variety of disadvantages. Users usually refuse to accept, or are unwilling to accept, these types of alterations in the appearance of a component used in the outdoor sector. A further disadvantage that should be stated is that the bleaching phenomenon can cause impairment of the mechanical properties of the molding.<br>
4<br><br>
The prior art has hitherto provided no indications as to how the abovementioned disadvantages can be avoided in the case of materials composed of colored halogen-containing polymers. A recommendation often encountered in this connection is to use appropriate stabilizers with respect to high-energy radiation, in particular with respect to UV radiation. While these measures certainly can bring about a slight delay in the bleaching process, the fundamental problem of unacceptably rapid alterations in the properties of the material remains unsolved.<br>
An object underlying the invention is therefore to provide a stabilizer composition for halogen-containing thermoplastic resins which, unlike the formulations known from the prior art, exhibits adequate weathering resistance. Another object underlying the invention is to provide a stabilizer composition for halogen-containing thermoplastic resins which is particularly suitable for use in UPVC for the outdoor sector.<br>
The invention achieves this object via a stabilizer composition for halogen-containing thermoplastic resins comprising by way of example<br>
(a)	at least one stabilizing calcium compound, for example calcium hydroxide and/or calcium oxide, where these may optionally have been surface-modified, or a calcium salt of an organic carboxylic acid and<br>
(b)	at least one dye or at least one pigment or both and<br>
(c)	at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups,<br>
where, based on the entire stabilizer composition, the content of P-diketones is less than 0.1% by weight in the stabilizer composition.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a stabilizer composition for the stabilization of halogen-containing thermoplastic resins, comprising<br>
5<br><br>
(a)	at least one stabilizing calcium compound or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component A and<br>
(b)	at least one dye or one pigment or their mixture as component B and<br>
(c)	at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component C,<br>
where, based on the entire stabilizer composition, the content of (3-diketone or salts of a P-diketone or their mixtures is less than 0.1% by weight in the stabilizer composition.<br>
A stabilizer composition of the present invention is in principle suitable for the stabilization of compositions which comprise at least one halogen-containing polymer, in particular at least one halogen-containing thermoplastic resin. The invention provides here that an inventive stabilizer composition comprises at least one stabilizing calcium compound, for example a stabilizing calcium salt. Suitable stabilizing calcium compounds are in principle any of the calcium compounds, such as calcium salts, which have a stabilizing effect on halogen-containing thermoplastic resins, in particular a stabilizing effect with respect to degradation via thermal stresses such as in particular those occurring during the processing of these halogen-containing thermoplastic resins.<br>
By way of example, a suitable component A is calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide or their mixture, in essence in any desired form. Calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide are preferably used here in powder form. Suitable powders can have a size distribution of the powder particles which is in essence as desired, as long as the stabilizing result is not impaired by the particle size distribution selected or is not impaired substantially more than is tolerable in the circumstances. Similar considerations apply to the BET surface area of the particles used.<br>
By way of example, for the purposes of the present invention use is made of calcium oxide particles or calcium hydroxide particles whose D50 value for the particle size distribution is about 30 pm or less, in particular less than about 10 urn or less than about 5 urn. The secondary particle size (agglomerate size) should not exceed a value of about 40 um. The<br>
6<br><br>
secondary particle size is preferably less than about 40 urn, in particular less than about 30 um or less than about 20 urn.<br>
The calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide particles can optionally have been surface-modified in a manner known to the person skilled in the art. Particles surface-modified with stearic acid or with 12-hydroxystearic acid are particularly suitable. Other suitable stabilizing calcium compounds are calcium soaps of saturated, unsaturated, straight-chain or branched, aromatic, cycloaliphatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids or hydroxycarboxylic acids preferably having from about 2 to about 22 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable carboxylic acid anions comprise anions of monovalent carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, hexanoic acid, enanthic acid, octanoic acid, neodecanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, pelargonic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tridecanoic acid, myristylic acid, palmitic acid, laurylic acid, isostearic acid, stearic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid, 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid, oleic acid, 3,6-dioxaheptanoic acid, 3,6,9-trioxadecanoic acid, behenic acid, benzoic acid, p-tert-butylbenzoic acid, dimethylhydroxybenzoic acid, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, toluic acid, dimethylbenzoic acid, ethylbenzoic acid, n-propylbenzoic acid, salicylic acid, p-tert-octylsalicylic acid, sorbic acid, anions of divalent carboxylic acids and, respectively, their monoesters, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, salicylic acid, polyglycoldicarboxylic acids whose degree of polymerization is from about 10 to about 12, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or hydroxyphthalic acid, anions of tri- or tetravalent carboxylic acids, respectively, their mono-, di- or triesters, such as hemimellitic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid or citric acid or else what are known as overbased carboxylates as described by way of example in DE-A 41 06 404 or in DE-A 40 02 988, the disclosure of the latter documents being incorporated as part of the disclosure of the present text.<br>
For the purposes of one preferred embodiment of the present invention calcium soaps are preferably used whose anions derive from saturated or unsaturated carboxylic acids or from hydroxycarboxylic acids having from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms. Particularly suitable compounds here are stearates, oleates, laurates, palmitates, behenates, versatates,<br>
7<br><br>
hydroxystearates, dihydroxystearates, p-tert-butylbenzoates or (iso) octanoates of calcium or mixtures composed of two or more thereof. For the purposes of another embodiment of the present invention an inventive stabilizer composition comprises, for example, calcium stearate.<br>
The invention has found that particularly good results can be achieved if the stabilizer composition comprises, based on the thermoplastic resin(s) to be stabilized, an amount of from 0.01 to 30 phr or from about 0.02 to about 20 phr or up to about 10 phr, of component A. Particularly suitable proportions of component A are by way of example in the range from about 0.05 to about 3.0 phr or within the range from about 0.08 to about 2.0 phr. Other amounts likewise suitable are, by way of example, from about 0.1 to about 1.5 phr, for example from about 0.15 to about 1.0 phr or from about 0.2 to about 0.8 phr or from about 0.25 to about 0.5 phr.<br>
An inventive stabilizer composition comprises, alongside a stabilizing calcium salt or a mixture composed of two or more such salts, at least one dye or at least one pigment or one mixture composed of at least one dye and of at least one pigment as component B.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, therefore, an inventive stabilizer composition relates to the stabilization of colored halogen-containing polymers. For the purposes of the present invention the term "colored" relates here to chromaticity coordinates L 1 or b = 0 ± &gt;1 or a = 0 ± &gt;1 and b = 0 ± &gt;1. By way of example, therefore, the "terracotta" shade often used in the context of production of PVC pipes features the following chromaticity coordinates: L = about 45, a = about 30 and b = about 37.<br>
The term "stabilizer composition" used for the purposes of the present text can therefore on the one hand refer to a stabilizer composition itself having the abovementioned ingredients. However, it can moreover likewise refer to a stabilizer composition present by this stage within a polymer composition, irrespective of the manner in which it has arisen.<br>
8<br><br>
The inventive term "stabilizer composition" can therefore by way of example also cover stabilizer compositions which have been previously mixed with polymer materials, where the individual ingredients of the stabilizer composition and a dye or a pigment or both have been introduced in their entirety to some extent in succession into the polymer.<br>
Suitable dyes for use for the purposes of the present stabilizer compositions are in principle any of the dyes which give the desired chromaticity coordinates to a polymer composition comprising said dye. Suitable pigments for use for the purposes of the present stabilizer compositions are correspondingly in principle any of the pigments which give the desired chromaticity coordinates to a polymer composition comprising said pigment. Examples worthy of mention here are the oxides, sulfides, chromates and carbon, these usually being classified as inorganic pigments. Organic dyes and pigments are likewise suitable, in particular those from the group of the azo dyes and azo pigments or else from the group of the polycyclic aromatic compounds.<br>
Examples of particularly suitable dyes and pigments are iron oxide, copper oxide, chromium oxide, mixed oxides containing copper and chromium or copper and iron or copper and chromium and iron in differing proportions, carbon blacks, iron oxide yellow, nickel titanium yellow, Cd sulfide, Cd selenide, lead chromate, lead molybdate, chromium oxide, Sb oxide, iron oxide red grades, ultramarines, cobalt blue grades, chromium oxide dihydrate, chromium oxide, cobalt green, Hansa pigments, benzidine pigments, toluidine pigments, lithol red grades, green gold, naphthol AS grades, azo condensation pigments, metal complex pigments, anthrapyrimidine, anthranthrone, perylenes, pyranthrone, quinophthalone, trans-perinone, thioindigo grades, quinacridones, isoviolanthrone, aniline black, indanthrene blue, dioxazines, phthalocyanine blue grades, phthalocyanine blue-green grades or phthalocyanine green grades.<br>
The invention has found that particularly good results can be achieved if the stabilizer composition comprises, based on the thermoplastic resin(s) to be stabilized, an amount of from 0.01 to 30 phr or from about 0.02 to about 20 phr or up to about 10 phr, of component B. Particularly suitable proportions of component B are by way of example in<br>
the range from about 0.05 to about 6.0 phr or within the range from about 0.08 to about<br>
9<br><br>
4.0 phr. Other amounts likewise suitable are, by way of example, from about 0.1 to about 3 phr, for example from about 0.15 to about 2.0 phr or from about 0.2 to about 1.6 phr or from about 0.25 to about 1 phr.<br>
An inventive stabilizer composition also comprises other compounds alongside components A and B. The invention has shown that it is advantageous for an inventive stabilizer composition to comprise at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups, in order to improve the stabilizing effect. An inventive stabilizer composition therefore comprises, alongside a stabilizing calcium salt or a mixture composed of two or more such salts and alongside the dyes or pigments or alongside a mixture composed of a dye and a pigment, at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component C.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, a suitable component C is in principle any of the isocyanurates which have at least one OH group. However, for the purposes of one<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, isocyanurates are used which contain at least two OH groups. However, for the purposes of the present invention it is particularly preferable to use isocyanurates which have three OH groups.<br>
For the purposes of one particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the isocyanurate containing hydroxy groups is selected from compounds of the general formula (II)<br><br><br><br>
in which the groups X and the indices n are identical or different and n is a whole number from 0 to 5 and X is a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms.<br>
10<br><br>
Particular preference is given here to tris(hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate (hereinafter termed THEIC) and also to hindered phenolic isocyanurates of EP 0 685 516 Bl, the disclosure of which with regard to appropriate hindered phenolic isocyanurates is expressly incorporated by way of reference and the disclosure of which concerning these isocyanurates is part of the disclosure of the present text.<br>
The invention has found that particularly good results can be achieved if the stabilizer composition comprises, based on the thermoplastic resin(s) to be stabilized, an amount of from 0.001 to 10 phr or from about 0.002 to about 8 phr or up to about 5 phr, of component C. Particularly suitable proportions of component C are by way of example in the range from about 0.005 to about 3.0 phr or within the range from about 0.005 to about 2.0 phr. Other amounts likewise suitable are, by way of example, from about 0.01 to about 1.0 phr, for example from about 0.02 to about 0.5 phr or by way of example from about 0.05 to about 0.3 phr or less, for example up to about 0.299 phr, based on the thermoplastic resin(s) to be stabilized.<br>
In a method which has proven successful in achieving an inventive effect, the content of P-diketone or salts of a P-diketone or their mixtures is less than about 0.1% by weight in an inventive stabilizer composition. By way of example, advantages can be achieved here if the content of p-diketone or salts of a P-diketone or their mixtures is less than about 0.05% by weight, less than about 0.01% by weight or less than about 0.005% by weight, based on the entire stabilizer composition. By way of example, the content of p-diketone or salts of a p-diketone or their mixtures is less than about 1000 ppm, in particular less than about 500 ppm or less than about 100 ppm or less than about 50 ppm in an inventive stabilizer composition.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, p-diketones are in particular compounds of the general formula I<br>
11<br><br><br>
(I),<br><br>
in which R1 and R3 are in each case mutually independent and are an unsubstituted or substituted linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl group having from 7 to 31 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl group having from 3 to 14 carbon atoms in the ring, or an unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 18 carbon atoms, or R1 or R3 are in each case mutually dependent and can be O-R1 or HN-R1, and R2 is O-R1 or COOH or an unsubstituted or substituted linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, or in each case R1 or R3 or R1 and R3 together with R2 form an unsubstituted or substituted cycloaliphatic or heterocycloaliphatic ring in each case having, mutually independently, from 3 to 18 carbon atoms, or else their salts.<br>
Corresponding compounds which are covered by the general formula I and whose content<br>
should for the purposes of the present invention be at or below the abovementioned upper<br>
limits are propionylacetylmethane, butyroylacetylmethane, pentanoylacetylmethane,<br>
hexanoylacetylmethane,	heptanoylacetylmethane,	triacetylmethane,<br>
benzoylacetylmethane, dimedone, acetyltetralone, palmitoyltetralone, stearoyltetralone,<br>
benzoyltetralone, acetylacetone, 2-acetylcyclohexanone, 2-benzoylcyclohexanone, 2-<br>
acetylcyclohexanone-1,3-dione,	bis(4-methylbenzoyl)methane,	bis(2-<br>
hydroxybenzoyl)methane,	tribenzoylmethane,	diacetylbenzoylmethane,<br>
stearoylbenzoylmethane,	palmitoylbenzoylmethane,	diacetylbenzoylmethane,<br>
dibenzoylmethane,	4-methoxybenzoylbenzoylmethane,	bis(3,4-<br>

butylbenzoyl)methane, benzoylacetylethylmethane, benzoyltrifluoroacetylmethane, distearoylmethane, stearoylacetylmethane, palmitoylacetylmethane, lauroylacetylmethane, benzoylformylmethane, acetylformylmethylmethane, benzoylacetylphenylmethane, bis (cyclohexanoyl(2))methane and the like.<br>
12<br><br>
Salts of these compounds are in particular the salts with alkali metals, with alkaline earth metals or with appropriate transition metals. Examples of appropriate salts are the salts of the abovementioned compounds with Li, Na, K, Ba, Ca, Mg, Zn, Zr, Ti, Sn or Al.<br>
For the purposes of another embodiment of the present invention it has been found advantageous for an inventive stabilizer composition to be in essence free from b-diketone or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures. "Free from b-diketone or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures" means for the purposes of the present invention a condition in which no b-diketones or salts of a b-diketone, not even very small amounts, are added to the stabilizer composition. The content of b-diketones or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures here is at most by way of example of the order of magnitude of minor contaminants or below the achievable detection limits of analysis methods commonly used at the time of the invention.<br>
If an inventive stabilizer composition comprises a component C, the content, based on the entire stabilizer composition, of components A, B and C in the stabilizer composition is from about 0.5 to about 80% by weight. The content of components A, B and C in such an instance is preferably from about 1 to about 50% by weight, for example from about 5 to about 20% by weight.<br>
The proportion of component A in the stabilizer composition here is by way of example in the range from about 0.5 to about 30% by weight, by way of example in the range from about 1 to about 25% by weight or in particular in the range from about 5 to about 20% by weight or by way of example in the range from about 8 to about 11% by weight, based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition. It has likewise been found advantageous for the proportion of component A in the stabilizer composition to be in the range from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight, by way of example in the range from about 1 to about 10% by weight or in the range from about 1.5 to about 7% by weight or in the range from about 2 to about 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition.<br>

For the purposes of the present invention, a type of hydrotalcite suitable here is in principle any type which with regard to processing properties and/or the stabilization of a halogen-containing polymer for the purposes of an inventive stabilizer composition at least exhibits no, or certainly in essence no, disadvantageous effect. Preference is moreover particularly given to those hydrotalcites which do not adversely affect the storage stability of an inventive stabilizer composition. By way of example, particularly suitable hydrotalcites are those described in the publications WO 96/02465 Al (in particular pp. 3 -7 and examples), EP 0 189 899 (in particular pp. 10 -15, tables 2 -10), DE 38 43 581 (in<br>

28<br><br>
weathering resistance and unexpectedly high heat resistance, and which also have excellent processing properties.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides a polymer composition comprising a stabilizer composition, a dye or a pigment or both and at least one polymer, comprising as stabilizer composition at least one stabilizing calcium compound, for example a stabilizing calcium salt, or a mixture composed of two or more such compounds and comprising as polymer a halogen-containing thermoplastic resin or a mixture composed of two or more halogen-containing thermoplastic resins where the polymer composition comprises less than 0.1 phr of b-diketone or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures.<br>
By way of example, the content of b-diketone or of salts of a b-diketone or of their mixtures is less than 0.05 phr or less than 0.01 phr or less than 0.005 phr or less than 0.001 phr or less than 0.005 phr or less than 0.001 phr in an inventive polymer composition. Other polymer compositions suitable for the purposes of the present invention are those whose content of b-diketone or of salts of a b-diketone or of their mixtures, based on the weight of the polymer composition, is about 0.1% by weight or less, for example less than about 0.05% by weight, less than about 0.01% by weight or less than about 0.005% by weight, based on the entire stabilizer composition. By way of example, the content of p-diketone or of salts of a b-diketone or of their mixtures can be less than about 1000 ppm, in particular less than about 500 ppm or less than about 100 ppm or less than about 50 ppm in an inventive polymer composition.<br>
An inventive polymer composition comprises an amount which is preferably from 0.01 to 2 phr of a stabilizing calcium salt or of a mixture composed of two or more of these salts as component A, based on the halogen-containing resin. An inventive polymer composition comprises an amount which is preferably from 0.01 to 2 phr of dyes or pigments or of their mixture as component B, based on the halogen-containing resin. An inventive polymer composition comprises an amount which is preferably from 0.01 to 2 phr of an isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups or of a mixture composed of two or more of these compounds as component C, based on the halogen-containing resin.<br>
29<br><br>
An inventive polymer composition preferably comprises a hydrotalcite or a mixture composed of two or more hydrotalcites. The invention therefore likewise encompasses polymer compositions which comprise a zinc salt or comprise a mixture composed of two or more zinc salts. The invention moreover encompasses polymer compositions which comprise a polyol, and also encompasses polymer compositions which are in essence free from P-diketones or from salts of P-diketones or from their mixtures.<br>
With respect to a polymer composition of the present invention, the statements made above in relation to the stabilizer composition are also applicable to the stabilizer components present in that polymer composition. A fundamental difference between the polymer compositions of the present invention and the inventive stabilizer compositions is that the stabilizer compositions comprise no polymer. In other respects, the properties of the stabilizer compositions present in the polymer composition and of the inventive stabilizer compositions are identical, and the abovementioned statements with regard to the stabilizer compositions are therefore also applicable to the stabilizer components present in the polymer compositions.<br>
For the purposes of one preferred embodiment of the present invention, an inventive polymer composition comprises an amount of from about 0.1 to 20 phr, in particular from about 0.5 to about 15 phr, or from about 1 to about 12 phr, or from about 1.5 to 5 phr of the inventive stabilizer composition. The ideal amount for a particular instance also depends here on the lubricants used. The unit phr is "per hundred resin" and therefore relates to parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer. Examples of suitable amounts used are within the range of about 2-3 phr and, respectively, 3-4 phr, if a proportion of processing aids is included in the calculation.<br>
An inventive polymer composition preferably comprises, as halogenated polymer, at least a proportion of PVC, the proportion of PVC here in particular being at least about 20% by weight, preferably at least about 50% by weight, for example at least about 80% by weight or at least about 90% by weight.<br>
30<br><br>
The mixing of polymers or of polymers and of the inventive stabilizer composition for the preparation of the inventive polymer compositions can in principle take place at any desired juncture prior to or during the processing of the polymer. By way of example, the<br>
stabilizer composition can be admixed with the polymer present in the form of powder or of pellets, prior to processing. However, it is similarly possible to add the stabilizer composition to the polymer or to the polymers in a softened or molten condition, for example during processing in an extruder.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides a process for the preparation of a polymer composition, comprising a stabilizer composition and at least one polymer, by mixing with one another<br>
(a)      at least one stabilizing calcium compound or one mixture composed of two or more stabilizing calcium compounds as component A and<br>
(b)	at least one dye or one pigment or one mixture composed of two or more thereof as component B and<br>
(c)	at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component C, and<br>
(d)	at least one halogen-containing thermoplastic resin or one mixture composed of two or more halogen-containing thermoplastic resins,<br>
where the polymer composition after mixing comprises less than 0.1 phr of b-diketone or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures.<br>
The inventive stabilizer composition can take any desired physical form, e.g. powder mixture form, compressed-granule form, spray-granule form, or microgranule-form, flake form or pastille form. These forms of the product can either be produced in the form of granules from pulverulent mixtures by compression and/or heat, and/or by adding granulation auxiliaries, or can be molded by cooling and, respectively, spraying of melts of the inventive composition to give flakes, pastilles or prills. For preparation of halogen-containing resin compositions, the individual substances can be added directly or in the form of a mixture in the abovementioned forms of the product prior to or during<br>
31<br><br>
processing. The halogen-containing thermoplastic resin composition can then be molded in a manner known per se to give moldings.<br>
An inventive polymer composition can be brought in a known manner to a desired shape. Examples of suitable processes are calendering, extrusion, injection molding, sintering, extrusion blow molding or the plastisol process. By way of example, an inventive polymer composition can also be used for the production of foams. In principle, the inventive polymer composition is suitable for the production of rigid PVC or of flexible PVC.<br>
An inventive polymer composition can be processed to give moldings. The present invention therefore also provides moldings for use in the weathered outdoor sector, at least comprising an inventive stabilizer composition or an inventive polymer composition.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "molding" in principle encompasses any of the three-dimensional structures that can be produced from an inventive polymer composition. For the purposes of the present invention, examples of products encompassed by the term "molding" are wire sheathing, automobile components, such as the automobile components used in the engine compartment or used on the external areas, cable insulation, cable sheathing, decorative foils, agricultural foils, hoses, sealing profiles, office foils, hollow products (bottles), packaging foils (thermoforming foils), blown foils, pipes, foams, heavy-duty profiles (window frames), lightweight-wall profiles, construction profiles, sidings, fittings, foam sheets and other sheets, coextrudates with recycled core, housings for electrical apparatuses or machines, for example computers or household devices, in particular for use in the weathered outdoor sector. Other examples of moldings that can be produced from an inventive polymer composition are synthetic leather, floor coverings, textile coatings, wallpapers, coil coatings, or underbody protection for motor vehicles.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of an inventive stabilizer composition or of an inventively prepared stabilizer composition or of an inventive polymer composition in the production of polymeric moldings or of surface-coating compositions for use in the<br>
weathered outdoor sector.<br>
32<br><br>
The invention in particular provides the use of a stabilizer composition for the stabilization of a halogen-containing thermoplastic resin or of a mixture composed of two or more halogen-containing thermoplastic resins, where the stabilizer composition comprises at least<br>
(a)	one stabilizing calcium compound or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component A and<br>
(b)	at least one dye or one pigment or one mixture composed of two or more thereof as component B and<br>
(c)	at least one isocyanurate bearing hydroxy groups or one mixture composed of two or more such compounds as component C,<br>
where the content of b-diketone or salts of a b-diketone or their mixtures is less than 0.1% by weight in the stabilizer composition.<br>
