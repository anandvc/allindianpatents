				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an electrode for electrolytic processes, in particular to a cathode<br>
suitable for hydrogen evolution in an industrial electrolytic process. Reference will be<br>
made hereafter to chlor-alkali electrolysis as the typical industrial electrolytic process<br>
with hydrogen cathodic evolution, but the invention is not restricted to a specific<br>
application. In the electrolytic process industry, competitiveness is associated with<br>
different factors, the main of which being energy consumption reduction, directly<br>
connected with the process voltage; this justifies the many efforts directed to reduce it in<br>
its various components, for instance ohmic drops, which depend on process parameters<br>
such as temperature, electrolyte concentration and interelectrodic gap, as well as<br>
anodic and cathodic overvoltage. The problem of anodic overvoltage, in principle more<br>
critical, was tackled in the past by developing increasingly sophisticated catalytic<br>
anodes, based initially on graphite and later on titanium substrates coated with suitable<br>
catalysts, which in the case of chlor-alkali electrolysis are specifically directed to<br>
decrease chlorine evolution overvoltage. Conversely, cathodic overvoltage naturally<br>
obtainable with electrodes made of uncatalysed chemically resistant material (for<br>
example carbon steel) were accepted for a long time. The market is nevertheless<br>
demanding increasingly high caustic product concentrations, making the use of carbon<br>
steel cathodes unviable from a corrosion standpoint; furthermore, the increase in the<br>
cost of energy has made the employment of catalysts to be increasingly convenient also<br>
to facilitate cathodic hydrogen evolution. The most common solutions known in the art<br>
to obviate these needs are represented by the use of nickel substrates, chemically more<br>
resistant than carbon steel, and of catalytic materials based on ruthenium oxide or<br>
platinum. US 4,465,580 and 4,238,311 for instance disclose nickel cathodes provided<br>
with a coating of ruthenium oxide mixed with nickel oxide, which for a long time has<br>
constituted a more expensive but technically better alternative to the carbon steel<br>
cathodes of the previous generation. Such cathodes however were affected by a rather<br>
limited lifetime, probably due to the poor adhesion of the coating to the substrate.<br>
A substantial improvement in the adhesion of the catalytic coating on the nickel<br>
substrate was introduced by the cathode disclosed in EP 298 055, which comprises a<br>
nickel substrate activated with a platinum or other noble metal and a cerium compound,<br><br><br>
simultaneously or sequentially applied and thermally decomposed in order to obtain a<br>
catalytic coating based on platinum or other noble metal either diluted with cerium or, in<br>
a preferred embodiment, coated with a porous layer of cerium having a protective<br>
function: the role of cerium is in fact to destroy the possible iron-based impurities, which<br>
would prove harmful for the noble metal catalyst activity. Albeit an improvement over the<br>
prior art, the cathode of EP 298 055 presents a catalytic activity and a stability in<br>
electrolysis conditions not yet sufficient for the needs of present-day industrial<br>
processes; in particular, the coating of EP 298 055 tends to be seriously damaged by<br>
the occasional current inversions typically taking place in case of malfunctioning of the<br>
industrial plants.<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide a new cathode composition for<br>
industrial electrolytic processes, in particular for electrolytic processes with cathodic<br>
hydrogen evolution.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a cathode composition for industrial<br>
electrolytic processes with a higher catalytic activity than the formulations of the prior<br>
art.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a cathode composition for industrial<br>
electrolytic processes characterised by a higher duration in the usual process conditions<br>
than the formulations of the prior art.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a cathode composition for industrial<br>
electrolytic processes with a higher tolerance to accidental current inversion than the<br>
formulations of the prior art.<br>
These and other objects will be better clarified by the following description, which is not<br>
intended as a limitation of the invention whose scope is defined by the appended<br>
claims.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under a first aspect, the invention consists of a cathode for electrolytic processes,<br>
particularly suitable for being employed in the electrolysis of alkali chloride brines (chlor-<br>
alkali process) obtained on a nickel substrate and provided with a coating comprising<br>
two distinct zones, a first zone comprising palladium and optionally silver and having a<br>
protective function especially towards current inversion phenomena (protection zone),<br>
and a second active zone comprising platinum and/or ruthenium, optionally mixed with a<br>
small amount of rhodium, having a catalytic function toward cathodic hydrogen evolution<br>
(activation zone). Platinum and ruthenium contained in the activation zone, as well as<br>
palladium and silver contained in the protection zone, may be present at least in part in<br>
form of oxides; throughout the present description, the presence of a given element is<br>
not intended as limited to the metallic form or to the zero oxidation state. In a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, palladium is contained in a distinct layer,<br>
intermediate between the nickel substrate and the outer activation layer containing the<br>
catalyst for hydrogen evolution based on platinum and/or ruthenium. In a second<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, palladium is segregated in islands dispersed<br>
within the activation layer containing the platinum and/or ruthenium-based catalyst for<br>
hydrogen evolution.<br>
Although palladium to some extent would be suitable per se to catalyse cathodic<br>
hydrogen evolution, as known from the scientific literature, in the formulations according<br>
to the present invention the availability of sensibly more active catalytic sites prevents<br>
an appreciable hydrogen evolution to take place on the palladium sites, as will be<br>
evident to one skilled in the art. Palladium conversely imparts a surprising effect of<br>
lifetime enhancement of the cathodes of the invention, especially in conditions of<br>
repeated current inversions due to accidental malfunctioning of the relevant<br>
electrolysers. Without wishing to limit the present invention to a particular theory, it may<br>
be assumed that during the normal electrolysis operation palladium, especially in<br>
conjunction with silver, forms hydrides, which are ionised in case of current inversion<br>
thereby preventing the cathode potential to be shifted to values high enough to give rise<br>
to significant dissolution phenomena of ruthenium and platinum. Palladium or even<br>
better palladium/silver mixtures would thus behave as a reversible hydrogen sponge<br><br><br>
capable of releasing hydrogen ionised during the inversion events as soon as normal<br>
functioning conditions are restored (self-hydridisation effect). In one preferred<br>
embodiment, a 20% Ag molar palladium/silver mixture is advantageously used, but Ag<br>
molar concentrations may range from 15 to 25% still showing an optimum self-<br>
hydridisation functionality.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the catalytic component of the cathode of the invention,<br>
based on platinum and/or ruthenium and optionally containing small amounts of<br>
rhodium, is stabilised in cathodic discharge conditions upon addition of elements<br>
present in form of oxides with high oxidising power. In fact it was surprisingly observed<br>
that the addition of elements like Cr or Pr can preserve the catalyst activity while<br>
contributing to the stability thereof; for example the addition of Pr, preferably in a 1:1<br>
molar ratio (or in any case in a preferred molar ratio of 1:2 to 2:1) with respect to Pt<br>
proves particularly effective. Such beneficial effect was also observed with ruthenium<br>
oxide-based activations. The fact that praseodymium proved particularly suitable for this<br>
function allows to suppose that also the other rare earth group elements capable of<br>
forming oxides with high oxidising power are generally suitable for imparting stability to<br>
platinum or ruthenium-based catalysts.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention particularly suited to the formulation of cathodes for<br>
chlor-alkali processes, a nickel substrate (for instance a mesh or an expanded or<br>
punched sheet or an arrangement of parallel slanted strips known in the art as louver) is<br>
provided with a dual coating comprised of a catalytic layer containing 0.8 to 5 g/m2 of<br>
noble metal (activation zone), and of a protection zone containing 0.5 to 2 g/m2 Pd<br>
optionally mixed with Ag, either in form of intermediate layer between the catalytic<br>
activation layer and the substrate, or in form of islands dispersed within the catalytic<br>
activation layer. By noble metal loading of the catalytic coating according to the<br>
invention it is herein intended the content of platinum and/or ruthenium, optionally<br>
added with a small amount of rhodium; in particular, the content of rhodium is preferably<br>
10 to 20% by weight of the overall noble metal content in the activation zone.<br>
The preparation of a cathode in accordance with the invention is a particularly delicate<br>
operation especially as concerns those embodiments wherein the activation zone is<br>
overlaid to a protection zone consisting of a palladium-containing intermediate layer; the<br><br><br>
anchoring of such intermediate layer to a nickel substrate is in fact optimal when it is<br>
prepared, as known in the art, starting from palladium precursors, optionally mixed with<br>
silver precursors, in acidic solution, for instance by nitric acid. In this way, the nickel of<br>
the substrate undergoes some superficial dissolution and the subsequent thermal<br>
decomposition gives rise to the formation of a mixed nickel and palladium oxide phase<br>
which is particularly compatible in terms of morphological characteristics with the<br>
underlying nickel substrate: hence the adhesion of the intermediate layer turns out to be<br>
optimal. On the other hand, the subsequent deposition of the activation layer proves<br>
surprisingly better when alcoholic or more preferably hydroalcoholic solutions are used;<br>
in a particularly preferred embodiment, for the preparation of a cathode on a nickel<br>
substrate comprising a protective zone in form of intermediate layer, two distinct<br>
solutions are prepared, a first aqueous solution of a Pd precursor, for instance Pd (II)<br>
nitrate, for instance acidified with nitric acid and optionally containing an Ag precursor;<br>
and a second hydroalcoholic solution, for instance containing Pt (II) diamino dinitrate or<br>
Ru (III) nitrosyl nitrate, with the optional addition of a small amount of a rhodium<br>
precursor, for instance Rh (III) chloride, and optionally Cr (III) or Pr (III) or other rare<br>
earth chloride, for instance in a 2-propanol, eugenol and water mixture. Each of the two<br>
solutions, starting from the palladium-containing aqueous solution, is applied in multiple<br>
coats, for instance 2 to 4 coats, carrying out a decomposition thermal treatment<br>
(typically at temperatures of 400 to 700°C, depending on the chosen precursor)<br>
between one coat and the next. After applying the last coat of the second solution, the<br>
final thermal treatment provides a high performance-cathode in terms of overvoltage,<br>
duration and current inversion tolerance. The indicated precursors are particularly<br>
suitable for obtaining a cathode with a final thermal treatment carried out at a limited<br>
temperature, characterised by an overall acceptable cost and by optimum performances<br>
also in terms of adhesion to the substrate, anyway other precursors may be used<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
The manufacturing of a cathode according to an embodiment providing a protection<br>
zone in form of palladium-rich islands within the activation zone is advantageously<br>
carried out by means of the application in multiple coats, for instance 2 to 4, of the same<br>
precursors of palladium, ruthenium and/or platinum, and optionally of an additional<br>
metal such as chromium, praseodymium or other rare earths, again in a preferably<br>
hydroalcoholic solution, even more preferably consisting of a 2-propanol, eugenol and<br><br><br>
water mixture, with subsequent thermal treatment between 400 and 700°C after each<br>
coat. The method takes advantage of the impossibility to form palladium alloys with<br>
platinum and ruthenium in normal conditions due to the difference in the metal lattices of<br>
such elements, resulting in physically distinct protection zone and activation zones: a<br>
palladium-rich phase (protection zone) tends to segregate in islands within the<br>
activation zone, acting as preferential hydrogen absorption sites, particularly useful<br>
during the occasional current inversion phenomena.<br>
The invention will be better understood by aid of the following examples, which shall not<br>
be intended as a limitation of the scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A 1 mm thick, 30 cm x 30 cm nickel net with rhomboidal meshes (4x8 mm diagonals),<br>
subjected to the steps of sand-blasting, degreasing and washing as known in the art,<br>
was painted with 3 coats of an aqueous solution of Pd (II) nitrate and AgNO3, acidified<br>
with nitric acid, with execution of a 15 minute thermal treatment at 450°C after each coat<br>
until obtaining a deposit of 0.92 g/m2 Pd and 0.23 g/m2 Ag. On the so-obtained<br>
palladium-silver layer, 4 coats of Pt (II) diamino dinitrate in a hydroalcoholic solution<br>
containing 25% by weight 2-propanol, 30% eugenol and 45% water were applied, with<br>
execution of a 15 minute thermal treatment at 475°C after each coat until obtaining a 2<br>
g/m2 Pt deposit.<br>
The catalytic activity of the cathode thus obtained was determined in a membrane-type<br>
sodium chloride brine electrolysis cell producing 32% NaOH at a temperature of 90°C<br>
and at a current density of 6 kA/m2, and compared to a cathode of the prior art<br>
consisting of an analogous nickel net activated with the Pt-Ce coating disclosed in<br>
Example 1 of EP 298 055, with an equivalent Pt loading of 2 g/m2.<br>
In the course of 8 hours of testing, the voltage of the cell, equipped in both cases with<br>
an equivalent titanium anode coated with titanium and ruthenium oxides, remained<br>
stable around a value of 3.10 V for the cathode of the invention and 3.15 V for the<br>
cathode of EP 298 055.<br><br><br>
The tolerance to inversions for the two cathodes was compared by the standard cyclic<br>
voltammetry test which provides, at the specified process conditions, alternating the<br>
polarisation from -1.05 V/NHE to +0.5 V/NHE and back, at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, until<br>
deactivation is observed (loss of catalytic activity with cathodic potential exceeding the<br>
value of -1.02 V/NHE at 3 kA/m2).<br>
Following this test, the cathode of the invention showed a tolerance to 25 inversions at<br>
the specified experimental conditions versus 4 inversions of the cathode of the prior art.<br>
The test demonstrated the higher tolerance to inversions of the cathode of the invention<br>
over the one of the prior art, with an at least comparable catalytic activity; it is also<br>
known to those skilled in the art that a higher tolerance to inversions is also a reliable<br>
indication of a higher overall duration at the usual operating conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A 1 mm thick, 30 cm X 30 cm nickel net with rhomboidal meshes (4x8 mm diagonals),<br>
subjected to the steps of sand-blasting, degreasing and washing as known in the art,<br>
was painted with 3 coats of an aqueous solution of Pd (II) nitrate, acidified with nitric<br>
acid, with execution of a 15 minute thermal treatment at 450°C after each coat until<br>
obtaining a deposit of 1 g/m2 Pd. On the so-obtained palladium layer, 4 coats of a<br>
hydroalcoholic solution consisting of 25% by weight 2-propanol, 30% eugenol and 45%<br>
water, containing Pt (II) diamino dinitrate and Pr (III) nitrate in a 1:1 molar ratio were<br>
applied, with execution of a 15 minute thermal treatment at 475°C after each coat until<br>
obtaining a deposit of 2.6 g/m2 Pt and 1.88 g/m2 Pr.<br>
The catalytic activity of the so-obtained cathode was determined by the same test of<br>
example 1 and compared to a cathode of the prior art consisting of an analogous nickel<br>
net activated with the Pt-Ce coating disclosed in Example 1 of EP 298 055, with an<br>
equivalent Pt loading of 2.6 g/m2.<br>
In the course of 8 hours of testing, the cell voltage remained stable around a value of<br>
3.05 V for the cathode of the invention and 3.12 V for the cathode of EP 298 055.<br><br><br>
The tolerance to inversions for the two cathodes was compared by the standard cyclic<br>
voltammetry test of example 1.<br>
Following this test, the cathode of the invention showed a tolerance to 29 inversions at<br>
the specified experimental conditions versus 3 inversions of the cathode of the prior art.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A 1 mm thick, 30 cm X 30 cm nickel net with rhomboidal meshes (4x8 mm diagonals),<br>
subjected to the steps of sand-blasting, degreasing and washing as known in the art,<br>
was painted with 5 coats of a hydroalcoholic solution consisting of 25% by weight 2-<br>
propanol, 30% eugenol and 45% water, containing Pd (II) nitrate, Pt (II) diamino<br>
dinitrate and Cr (III) nitrate, with execution of a 15 minute thermal treatment at 475°C<br>
after each coat until obtaining a deposit of 2.6 g/m2 Pt, 1 g/m Pd and 1.18 g/mz Cr.<br>
The catalytic activity of the so-obtained cathode was determined by means of the same<br>
test of the preceding examples and compared to a cathode of the prior art consisting of<br>
an analogous nickel net activated with the Pt-Ce coating disclosed in Example 1 of EP<br>
298 055, with an equivalent Pt loading of 3.6 g/m2.<br>
In the course of 8 hours of testing, the cell voltage remained stable around a value of<br>
3.05 V for the cathode of the invention and 3.09 V for the cathode of EP 298 055.<br>
The tolerance to inversions for the two cathodes was compared by the standard cyclic<br>
voltammetry test of the previous examples.<br>
Following this test, the cathode of the invention showed a tolerance to 20 inversions at<br>
the specified experimental conditions versus 4 inversions of the cathode of the prior art.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A 1 mm thick, 30 cm X 30 cm nickel net with rhomboidal meshes (4x8 mm diagonals),<br>
subjected to the steps of sand-blasting, degreasing and washing as known in the art,<br>
was painted with 5 coats of an aqueous solution acidified with nitric acid, containing Pd<br><br>
(II) nitrate, Pt (II) diamino dinitrate, Rh (III) chloride and Pr (III) nitrate, with execution of<br>
a 12 minute thermal treatment at 500°C after each coat until obtaining a deposit of 1.5<br>
g/m2 Pt, 0.3 g/m2 Rh, 1 g/m Pd and 2.8 g/m2 Pr.<br>
The catalytic activity of the so-obtained cathode was determined by means of the same<br>
test of the preceding examples and compared to a cathode of the prior art consisting of<br>
an analogous nickel net activated with the Pt-Ce coating disclosed in Example 1 of EP<br>
298 055, with a Pt loading of 3 g/m2.<br>
In the course of 8 hours of testing, the cell voltage remained stable around a value of<br>
3.02 V for the cathode of the invention and 3.08 V for the cathode of EP 298 055.<br>
The tolerance to inversions for the two cathodes was compared by the standard cyclic<br>
voltammetry test of the previous examples.<br>
Following this test, the cathode of the invention showed a tolerance to 25 inversions at<br>
the specified experimental conditions versus 4 inversions of the cathode of the prior art.<br>
