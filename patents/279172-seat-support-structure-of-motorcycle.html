[Title of the Invention]  SEAT SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement of the seat support structure of a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As the conventional seat support structure of a motorcycle, there has been known the seat support structure which receives a load which acts on a seat by supporting a mounting member formed on a lower portion of the seat using support bolts mounted on a seat rail side (for example, see patent literature 1).<br>
[Patent Literature 1]   Japanese Patent Laid-open 2002-284075 [0003]<br>
Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 of the patent literature 1 show the structure in which a mounting member 32 extends downwardly from a bottom plate 31 of a seat S at an approximately center portion thereof in the longitudinal direction, a support bolt 36 is mounted on a rail frame 16 of a seat rail 11 mounted on a rear portion of a vehicle body frame by way of a bracket 35, an elongated hole 33 is formed in a lower portion of the mounting member 32, and the support bolt 36 is inserted into the<br>
elongated hole 33, whereby a load which acts on the seat S is supported on the support bolt 36 by way of the mounting member.<br>
The seat S is vertically movable within a range of a gap between the elongated hole 33 and the support bolt 36. [Disclosure of the Invention] [0004]<br>
For example, the sinking of the seat S attributed to a rider who sits on a front portion of the seat S is restricted by the mounting member 32 and the support bolt 36. However, sinking of the seat S attributed to a pillion who sits on a rear portion of the seat S is not taken into consideration with respect to the above-mentioned motorcycle and hence, when the load which acts on the rear portion of the seat S is large, there may be a case in which the sinking of the rear portion of the seat S becomes excessively large. Accordingly, for example, when a gap between the seat S and a rear cowl which is arranged below the seat S is largely set by taking such a large sinking into consideration, the gap becomes conspicuous thus worsening the appearance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to restrict the sinking of a rear portion of a seat by improving the seat support structure of a motorcycle. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
The invention according to claim 1 is characterized in<br>
that, in a motorcycle in which a seat load which acts on a seat is received by a cross member mounted on a rear portion of a vehicle body, a raised portion is formed by raising the cross member behind a first load receiver which is mounted on the cross member, and a second load receiver is mounted on the raised portion. [0006]<br>
The load which acts on the seat is supported by the first load receiver which is mounted on the cross member and the second load receiver of the raised portion which is formed by raising the cross member behind the first load receiver.<br>
Particularly, the second load receiver supports the seat load attributed to the pillion who rides on the rear portion of the seat and can suppress the sinking of the rear portion of the seat. [0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 2 is characterized in that an inserting portion is formed on a lower portion of the seat in a projecting manner, an engaging portion which is engaged with the inserting portion is mounted on the cross member, and the engaging member is configured such that a gate-shaped hook is mounted on the cross member and a rubber is arranged below the hook. [0008]<br>
When the inserting portion formed on the lower portion<br>
of the seat in a projecting manner is engaged with the engaging portion formed on the cross member, due to the provision of the rubber, there is no possibility that the inserting portion comes into direct contact with the cross member and, at the same time, a buffer effect can be achieved. [0009]<br>
The invention according to claim 3 is characterized in that a regulator is mounted on a back surface of the raised portion.<br>
The heat generated by the regulator is transferred to the raised portion and is irradiated from the regulator per se and the raised portion. [0010]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that grab rails are mounted on the cross member and third load receivers are mounted on the grab rails.<br>
By mounting the grab rails on both sides of the cross member, it is possible to increase a distance between the third load receivers which are provided on left and right sides of the grab rails and hence, the inclination of the seat in the lateral direction can be suppressed correspondingly. [Advantage of the Invention] [0011]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, since the second load receiver is formed on the raised portion which<br>
is formed behind the first load receiver, when the rider and the pillion sit on the seat, the load which acts on the seat can be received by the first load receiver and the second load receiver. Particularly, the sinking of the rear portion of the seat can be restricted by the second load receiver. Further, for example, it is unnecessary to form the large gap between the seat and the vehicle body cover by taking the sinking of the seat into consideration and hence, it is possible to enhance the appearance of the rear portion of the vehicle. [0012]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, the seat support structure includes the inserting portion which is formed on the lower portion of the seat in a projecting manner and the engaging portion which is engaged with the inserting portion, and the gate-shaped hook is mounted on the cross member and the rubber is arranged below the hook in the engaging portion and hence, there is no possibility that the inserting portion below the seat and the cross member directly come into contact with each other in the engaging portion whereby the riding feeling can be enhanced. [0013]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, since the regulator is mounted on the back surface of the raised portion, it is possible to accelerate the radiation of heat from the regulator by the raised portion whereby the<br>
performance of the regulator can be maintained. [0014]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, since the grab rails are mounted on the cross member and the third load receivers are mounted on the grab rails, it is possible to increase the lateral span of the third load receivers whereby the inclination of the seat in the lateral direction can be suppressed.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0015]<br>

In such a constitution, a plurality of bolt inserting holes 151d are formed in the frame-side mounting portions 151e, 151e and a plurality of nuts 186 are mounted on a bottom surface of the frame-side mounting portions 151e, 151e. Further, bolt inserting holes 151f, 151f which allow bolts for mounting the mounting portions 144a, 144b of the rear cover 144 to pass therethrough are formed in rear portions of the frame-side mounting portions 151e, 151e and, at the same time, nuts 191, 191 are mounted on bottom surfaces of the frame-side mounting portions 151e, 151e.<br>
The hook 154 is a member having a U-shape in a plan view<br>
and a width of the rubber plate 156 is substantially arranged equal to a lateral width of the inside of the hook 154. [0038]<br>
Fig. 6 is a transverse cross-sectional view of the rear portion of the vehicle body according to the present invention. The cross plate 151 is a member which has an approximately U-shaped cross section, wherein the frame-side mounting portion 151e is constituted of vertical portions 151g which extend substantially vertically from the seat rails 23, 24 and a horizontal portion 151h which extends from upper end portions of the vertical portions 151g in a substantially horizontal manner. [0039]<br>
The base portions 166, 167 are respectively constituted of load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d which are mounted on the frame-side mounting portions 151e of the cross plate 151, sideward inclined portions 166e, 167e which are extended obliquely in the sideward and downward direction from the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d respectively, and side horizontal portions 166f, 167f which are respectively extended sideward and substantially horizontally from the side inclined portions 166e, 167e and are mounted on the grab rail body 168. [0040]<br>
By forming the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d for receiving a load of the seat 16 on the above-mentioned base<br>
portions 166, 167 by way of the cushion rubbers 174, 174, a distance D between the cushion rubbers 174, 174 can be increased compared to a case in which the cushion rubbers 174, 174 are brought into contact with the cross plate 151 and hence, the inclination of the seat 16 in the lateral direction of the vehicle can be further suppressed. [0041]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 described above, the present invention is characterized in that the inserting portion 157a is formed on the lower portion of the seat 16 in a projecting manner, the engaging portion 165 which is engaged with the inserting portion 157a is formed on the cross plate 151 which constitutes a cross member, the gate-shaped hook 154 is formed on the cross plate 151 in the engaging portion 165, and the rubber plate 156 which constitutes the rubber is arranged below the hook 154. [0042]<br>
By providing the inserting portion 157a of the seat 16 and the engaging portion 165 which is engaged with the inserting portion 157a, by forming the hook 154 on the cross plate 151 in the engaging portion 165, and by arranging the rubber plate 156 below the hook 154, in the engaging portion 165, there is no possibility that the inserting portion 157a of the seat 16 and the cross plate 151 are brought into direct contact with each other due to the provision of the rubber plate 156 and,<br>
at the same time, the riding feeling can be enhanced due to<br>
a resilient force of the rubber plate 156.<br>
[0043]<br>
Further, the present invention is also characterized by mounting the regulator 164 on the back surface 162b of the raised portion 162.<br>
Due to the provision of the raised portion 162, the radiation of heat from the regulator 164 is accelerated and hence, the performance of the regulator 164 can be maintained. [0044]<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized by mounting the grab rail 87 on the cross plate 151 and by forming the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d as the third load receiver on the grab rail 87, and more particularly, on the base portions 166, 167. [0045]<br>
Since the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d are formed on the base portions 166, 167 of the grab rail 87, the distance in the lateral direction of the vehicle between the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d, that is, the distance D in the lateral direction of the vehicle between the cushion rubbers 174, 174 which are brought into contact with the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d can be increased whereby the inclination of the seat 16 on the left and right sides can be suppressed.<br>
[0046]<br>
The manner of operation of the seat support structure described above is explained hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 7(a), (b) are operational views which show the manner of operation of the seat support structure according to the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 7(a), for example, when only a rider sits on the front portion of the seat 16 or a small load (seat load Fl) acts on the rear portion of the seat 16, as shown in Fig. 6, the cushion rubbers 174 on the seat 16 side are brought into contact with the load receiving flat portions 166d, 167d and, at the same time, lower portions of the inserting portions 157a of the bottom plate 157 shown in Fig. 7(a) push the center inclined portion 161 of the cross plate 151 downwardly by way of the rubber plate 156. [0047]<br>
In Fig. 7(b), for example, when the rider sits on the front portion of the seat 16 and the pillion sits on the rear portion of the seat 16, the seat 16 is further deflected from the state shown in Fig. 7(a) and hence, the contact surface 157b formed on the rear end portion of the bottom plate 157 is brought into contact with the rear seat load receiver 162a formed on the upper end of the raised portion 162 of the cross plate 151 and receives the seat load F2 (F2&gt;F1) . Accordingly, even when the seat load F2 is large, it is possible to suppress<br>
the large sinking of the seat 16 with the provision of the rear<br>
seat load receiver 162a.<br>
[0048]<br>
Accordingly, even when the gap C between the seat 16 and the rear cover 144 in a state that neither the rider nor the pillion sits on the seat 16 shown in Fig. 2 is small, it is possible to prevent the interference between the seat 16 and the rear cover 144 whereby the gap C becomes less conspicuous thus enhancing the appearance of the rear portion of the vehicle. [0049]<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view showing a rear portion of a rear fender of the motorcycle according to the present invention. In the drawing, a pair of left and right through holes 138a, 138a are formed in the rear fender 13 8, mounting bolts 201, 201 are allowed to pass through these through holes 138a, 138a and these mounting bolts 201, 201 are threadedly engaged with nuts 202, 202 whereby, on the rear fender 138, a license plate support stay 204 which supports a license plate 203 and a blinker stay 143 which supports rear blinkers 141, 142 together with the rear fender 138 are mounted. [0050]<br>
Here, numerals 208, 211 indicate bolts and nuts which are served for mounting the license plate 2 03 on the license plate support stay 2 04, numeral 212 indicates nuts which are<br>
threadedly engaged with bolts 213 projected from the rear blinkers 141, 142 respectively for jointly fastening the rear fender 138 and the blinker stay 143. [0051]<br>
The rear fender 138, the license plate support stay 204 and the blinker stay 143 are members which are respectively bent in a convex shape in the rearward direction of the vehicle to form convex bent portions 138c, 204c, 143c thus obviating the interference with the rear wheel 122. By arranging the rear fender 138, the license plate support stay 204 and the blinker stay 143 closer to the front portion of the vehicle, a total length of the motor cycle can be reduced. [0052]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 7(a), (b) described above, the present invention is characterized in that in the motorcycle 10 (see Fig. 1) in which the seat load which acts on the seat 16 is received by the cross plate 151 mounted on the rear portion of the vehicle body, the raised portion 162 is formed by raising the cross plate 151 behind the center inclined portion 161 which constitutes the first load receiver which is mounted on the cross plate 151, and the rear seat load receiver 162a which constitutes the second load receiver is mounted on the raised portion 162. [0053]<br>
Since the rear seat load receiver 162a is formed on the<br>
raised portion 162 which is formed behind the center inclined portion 161, when the rider and the pillion sit on the seat 16, the load (seat load F2) which acts on the seat 16 can be received by the center inclined portion 161 and the rear seat load receiver 162a. Particularly, the sinking of the rear portion of the seat can be restricted by the rear seat load receiver 162a. Further, for example, it is unnecessary to form the large gap C (see Fig. 2) between the seat 16 and the rear cover 144 which constitutes the vehicle body cover by taking the sinking of the seat 16 into consideration and hence, it is possible to enhance the appearance of the rear portion of the vehicle.<br>
[Industrial Applicability] [0055]<br>
