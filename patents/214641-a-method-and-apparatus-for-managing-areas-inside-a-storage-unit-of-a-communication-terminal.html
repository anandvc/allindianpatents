				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING AREAS INSIDE<br>
A STORAGE UNIT OF A COMMUNICATION TERMINAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for managing areas<br>
inside a storage unit of a communication terminal to be used by applications.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, mobile communication terminals such as a mobile phone have<br>
been used to access WWW (World Wide Web) servers over the Internet, thereby<br>
browsing websites or downloading and executing application programs (hereinafter,<br>
referred to simply as applications) executable on mobile phones. The downloaded<br>
applications are first typically stored into a nonvolatile memory or the like built in a<br>
mobile phone. The applications are then read from this memory and executed when<br>
needed.<br>
In contrast to hard disks and the like provided on PCs (Personal Computers) etc.,<br>
however, the nonvolatile memories built in mobile phones typically have small storage<br>
capacities. It is therefore impossible to store many applications. Consequently, when a<br>
new application is downloaded with no sufficient free space in the storage areas, the<br>
application(s) stored previously must be erased before the new application is stored.<br>
Besides, when applications once erased are to be executed again, the WWW servers<br>
must naturally be accessed again for download. This means operations troublesome to<br>
the users of the mobile phones. Then, for the sake of compensating the small storage<br>
capacities, detachable external memories are attached to the mobile phones so that the<br>
downloaded applications are stored into these external memories.<br>
With the advance and sophistication of applications in recent years, however,<br>
application sizes are also growing by leaps. It is thus difficult to provide sufficient<br>
memory capacities even by using external memories.<br>
With the advance and sophistication of applications in recent years,<br>
however, application sizes are also growing by leaps. It is thus difficult to<br>
provide sufficient memory capacities even by using external memories.<br>
In general, downloading an application requires that a storage area for<br>
storing the application itself and a storage area for storing data to be used by the<br>
application both be reserved. Since applications have different sizes and use<br>
different amounts of data, the necessary storage capacities vary from one<br>
application to another. Thus, for example, when the sizes of areas to be reserved for applications are fixed uniformly, there can occur spaces in which<br>
neither an application itself nor data to be used by the application is stored.<br>
The generation of such wasted spaces for no use at all is against efficiency.<br>
For efficient use of storage areas, it is preferable to change the sizes of<br>
areas to reserve in accordance with the sizes of the applications to be<br>
downloaded. In this case, an external memory is usually accessed by using<br>
both an interface for accessing the external memory and a device driver, a<br>
program for controlling this interface. To be more specific, permission to use<br>
the foregoing device driver and the like is granted to the applications, thereby<br>
allowing accesses to the external memory. This makes it possible to reserve<br>
storage areas of necessary and sufficient sizes depending on the applications.<br>
Nevertheless, if free accesses to the external memory are thus given to<br>
the applications downloaded to the terminal, there can occur the security<br>
problem that unauthorized applications tamper or erase other applications or<br>
data stored in the external memory. In addition, some applications might<br>
reserve excessively large storage areas.<br>
To avoid such unforeseeable circumstances, there has been a method of<br>
setting storage areas to be allocated for applications in advance (see Japanese<br>
Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. 2000-172490). Specifically,<br>
before downloading applications, the user of the mobile terminal sets the storage<br>
areas for storing the applications.<br><br>
Nevertheless, it is troublesome for the user to make an area setting upon<br>
each application download. Nevertheless, setting the storage areas for storing<br>
applications to be installed in uniform sizes regardless of the sizes of the<br>
respective applications might cause the problem, as described above, that<br>
applications having sizes greater than those of the areas reserved cannot be<br>
installed. In addition, if applications have sizes extremely smaller than those of<br>
the storage areas reserved, there arise a lot of unused spaces, precluding efficient<br>
use of the external memory.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been achieved in view of the foregoing<br>
circumstances. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a method<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to the drawings. Note that the invention is not limited to the<br>
present embodiment, but may include any embodiments as fall within the scope<br>
set forth in claims. By way of example, the present embodiment will deal with<br>
the case of storing an application program for conducting e-commerce by using<br>
a mobile phone (hereinafter, referred to as "electronic money application") and<br>
electronic money data to be used by this electronic money application into an<br>
external memory of the mobile phone.<br>
1. Overall Configuration<br>
 Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an example of the overall configuration of a<br>
communication system 10 according to the present embodiment. The<br>
communication system 10 may include a plurality of mobile phones and a<br>
plurality of content server. In order to avoid complicated drawings, however, a<br>
single mobile phone 600 and a single content server 100 alone are shown in the<br>
diagram.<br>
The content server 100 has an identifier for identifying the server, or<br>
domain name, "www.aaa.com". It has the same hardware configuration as that<br>
of a typical WWW server, and is operated by a provider who provides the<br>
application to client devices. The content server 100 is connected with the<br>
Internet 200, and carries out packet communication with client devices over the<br>
Internet 200.<br>
A mobile packet communication network 300 includes a wireless base<br>
station for carrying out wireless communication with mobile phones<br>
accommodated in the mobile packet communication network 300, an exchange<br>
" connected to the wireless base station, a gateway exchange connected to the<br>
exchange (none of these is shown), a gateway server 400 connected to the<br>
gateway exchange, and an area management server 500 connected to the<br>
gateway server 400.<br><br>
These wireless base station, exchange, gateway exchange, and gateway server<br>
400 are used to relay packet communication which is held between the mobile phones<br>
accommodated in the mobile packet communication network 300 and the WWW<br>
servers such as the content server 100 connected to the Internet 200.<br>
The gateway server 400 is connected with the Internet 200, and has the function<br>
of performing interconversion between a communication protocol used inside the mobile<br>
packet communication network 300 and a communication protocol used in the Internet<br>
200. Specifically, the gateway server 400 performs interconversion between the wireless<br>
communication protocol used in the mobile packet communication network 300 and<br>
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) which is used as the standard<br>
in the Internet 200. As a result, the communication to be held between the mobile<br>
packet communication network 300 and the Internet 200 is relayed by the gateway<br>
server 400.<br>
The area management server 500 is a server operated by a communication<br>
carrier who operates the mobile packet communication network 300. The area<br>
management server 500 is connected to the gateway server 400, and has the same<br>
hardware configuration as that of a typical WWW server. The area management server<br>
500 has the function of carrying out packet communication, and holds packet<br>
communication with the mobile phones accommodated in the mobile packet<br>
communication network 300 for data exchange.<br>
The mobile phone 600 is one owned by a not-shown user, and carries out packet<br>
communication with WWW servers connected to the Internet 200 over the mobile<br>
packet communication network 300. Consequently, the user can enjoy a variety of<br>
mobile data communication services provided by the mobile packet communication<br>
network 300.<br><content server><br><br>
The content server 100 has a storage unit 101 which includes storage<br>
devices such as a hard disk, and contains WEB page files to be described later,<br>
application programs to be provided to mobile phones, and so on. Specifically,<br>
the storage unit 101 contains an electronic money application "shopping" and an<br>
application program "trust" which is necessary for downloading the electronic<br>
money application to the mobile phone 600 (hereinafter, this will be referred to<br>
as "trusted application"). The reliability of this trusted application is secured in<br>
advance by the communication carrier who operates the mobile packet<br>
communication network 300.<br>
The electronic money application "shopping" is stored in a location<br>
specified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)<br>
"http://www.aaa.com/shopping". The trusted application "trust" is stored in a<br>
location specified by "http://www.aaa.com/trsut".<br>
The applications to be stored into the storage unit 101 are also given<br>
respective identifiers (hereinafter, referred to as application identifiers). For<br>
example, this electronic money application has an application identifier<br>
"AAA001". The trusted application is a program to be performed by the<br>
mobile phone 600, and has the function of downloading the electronic money<br>
application from the content server 100 and storing it into an external memory<br>
of the mobile phone by using a device driver provided in the mobile phone 600.<br>
To use the e-commerce service, the user of the mobile phone 600 has<br>
previously signed the use contract to the provider who operates the content<br>
server 100. That is, the electronic money application and electronic money<br>
data will be provided to the mobile phones 600 of contracted users alone.<br>
As shown by way of example in Fig. 2, the storage unit 101 contains an<br>
application contractor table TB1 which contains terminal identifiers for<br>
identifying the mobile phones 600 owned by contracted persons and the names<br>
of the contracted persons in association with each other. The storage unit 101<br>
also contains text files named "index.html" and "download.html" which are<br><br>
written in a markup language CHTML (Compact Hyper Text Markup Language).<br>
The file "index.html" is stored in a location specified by a URL<br>
"http://www.aaa.com/index.html", and "download.html" is stored in a location<br>
specified by a URL "http://www.aaa.com/download.html".<br>
The file "index.html" is written so that when it is interpreted by a WWW<br>
browser capable of CHTML interpretation, a WWW browser screen M2 shown<br>
by way of example in Fig. 3 appears. Moreover, "index.html" describes URLs<br>
that designate the storage locations of file for displaying pages linked with this<br>
page. The diagram shows an example of the screen to appear on the mobile<br>
phone 600 when the WWW browser executes this file "index.html".<br>
The file "download.html" is written so that when it is interpreted by a<br>
WWW browser capable of CHTML interpretation, a page for downloading the<br>
trusted application "trust" provided by the content server 100 appears on the<br>
screen of the WWW browser. In addition, "download.html" describes an URL<br>
that designates the storage location of the trusted application "trust". In Fig. 3,<br>
M3 shows an example of the screen to appear on the mobile phone when<br>
"download-html" is executed.<br>
The functions of the content server 100 will be described below.<br>
(A) Providing WEB Pages<br>
The content server 100 provides WEB pages for the mobile phone 600.<br>
Specifically, when the content server 100 receives a page request message<br>
transmitted from the mobile phone 600 to request a file for displaying a page,<br>
the message including a URL and the terminal identifier for identifying the<br>
mobile phone, it reads the file specified by the URL from the storage unit 101.<br>
Subsequently, the content server 100 generates a page transmission message<br>
including the file read from the storage unit 101. Subsequently, the content<br>
server 100 transmits the generated message to the mobile phone 600 that is<br>
identified by the terminal identifier included in the page request message.<br>
(B) Providing Applications<br><br>
When the content server 100 receives an application request message<br>
transmitted from the mobile phone 600 to request program download, the<br>
message including the terminal identifier and a URL, it searches the application<br>
contractor table TB1 with the terminal identifier included in the request message<br>
as a key.<br>
When the appropriate terminal identifier is stored in the application<br>
contractor table TB1, it is determined that the user of the mobile phone 600 is<br>
one of those who have signed the use contract for the electronic money<br>
application. Subsequently, the content server 100 reads the program specified<br>
by the URL from the storage unit 101.<br>
Next, the content server 100 generates an application transmission<br>
message including this program. Subsequently, the content server 100<br>
transmits the message generated thus to the mobile phone that is identified by<br>
the terminal identifier included in the application request message.<br>
(C) Instructing Execution of Trusted Application<br>
When this application request message is one for requesting the trusted<br>
application the content server 100 generates an application transmission<br>
message including the trusted application read from the storage unit 101 and an<br>
instruction for the destination mobile phone of this message to execute the<br>
trusted application. The content server 100 transmits the generated message to<br>
the mobile phone that is identified by the terminal identifier included in the<br>
application request message.<br>
(D) Providing Electronic Money Data<br>
When the content server 100 receives from the mobile phone 600 an<br>
electronic money request message for requesting electronic money data, it<br>
searches the application contractor table TB1 with the terminal identifier<br>
included in this message as a key.<br>
When the appropriate terminal identifier is found, the content server 100<br>
determines that the user of the mobile phone 600 originating the electronic<br><br>
money request message is one of those who have signed the use contract for the<br>
electronic money application. Subsequently, the content server 100 generates a<br>
message including electronic money data which indicates a predetermined<br>
amount of money. Next, the content server 100 transmits the generated<br>
message to the mobile phone 600 identified by the terminal identifier.<br><mobile phone><br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram showing an example of the hardware configuration of<br>
the mobile phone 600. As shown in Fig. 4, the components of the mobile<br>
phone 600 excluding an antenna 603 are connected to a bus 601. Data<br>
exchange between the individual components is performed through this bus 601.<br>
A communication unit 602 has the antenna 603, and carries out wifeless<br>
communication with the not-shown wireless base station constituting the mobile<br>
packet communication network 300 under the control of a CPU (Central<br>
Processing Unit) 611. An operation unit 604 has a plurality of keys including a<br>
not-shown numerical keypad. The user of the mobile phone 600 enters<br>
instructions by using the operation unit 604. Specifically, when the user of the<br>
mobile phone 600 operates the operation unit 604, signals corresponding to the<br>
operation are supplied to the CPU 611. A display 605 is composed of, for<br>
example, a liquid crystal display panel and a control circuit for exercising<br>
display control on the liquid crystal display panel. The display 605 displays<br>
text and graphic screens, and menu screens for operating the mobile phone 600,<br>
under the control of the CPU 611.<br>
A storage unit 606 has a nonvolatile memory (not shown) such as an<br>
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory), for<br>
example. It contains data for controlling the mobile phone 600 as well as the<br>
terminal identifier for identifying the mobile phone 600 uniquely. For example,<br>
this terminal identifier is a phone number "0*0^***-????". An external<br>
memory 607 is an IC card having a nonvolatile memory such as an EEPROM.<br>
It is detachably attached to the mobile phone 600 via an external memory<br><br>
interface unit 608. The external memory interface unit 608 is an interface for<br>
writing and reading data to/fromthe external memory 607 under the control of<br>
the CPU 611. A ROM (Read Only Memory) 609 contains various programs to<br>
be executed by the CPU 611. For example, it contains an OS (Operating<br>
System) program for controlling the entire mobile phone 600, a WWW browser<br>
program, and a device driver intended for the external memory 607.<br>
This device driver is composed of programs called "download helper"<br>
and "access helper". As will be detailed later, these programs are executed<br>
only when the trusted application is in execution. That is, while an application<br>
or data is downloaded, the trusted application, the download helper, and the<br>
access helper are executed. The storage area of the external memory 607 is<br>
optimized thus.<br>
A RAM (Random Access Memory) 610 is used as a work area of the<br>
CPU 611. Data to be used by the programs executed by the CPU 611 is<br>
temporarily stored therein. When the mobile phone 600 is powered on, the<br>
CPU 611 reads the OS from the ROM 609 for execution. When the OS is in<br>
execution, the CPU 611 performs processing according to signals received by<br>
the communication unit 602 and signals supplied from the operation unit 604.<br>
If a user operation instructs to start the WWW browser, the WWW browser<br>
program is read from the ROM 609 for execution. When a signal<br>
corresponding to a user operation is supplied from the operation unit 604 after<br>
the execution of the WWW browser, the CPU 611 identifies the user instruction<br>
based on this signal and the screen displayed on the display 605, and performs<br>
processing according to this instruction.<br>
The functions of the mobile phone 600 will be described below.<br>
(A) Page Browsing and File Download<br>
To browse a WEB page provided by a WWW server in connection with<br>
the Internet 200 from the mobile phone 600, the user of the mobile phone 600<br>
initially enters a URL. Subsequently, the CPU 611 transmits the page request<br><br>
message for requesting the file for displaying the WEB page specified by this<br>
URL, the message including the terminal identifier and the URL. This page<br>
request message includes the terminal identifier and the URL. Then, it receives<br>
the page transmission message transmitted from the content server 100 in<br>
response to the page request message, and extracts the file included in this page<br>
transmission message.<br>
Moreover, to download an application provided by a WWW server in<br>
connection with the Internet 200, the user makes a predetermined operation.<br>
The CPU 611 then transmits the application request message for requesting<br>
application download. This message includes the terminal identifier and a<br>
URL which designates the location of the file to be downloaded. Then, it<br>
receives the application transmission message transmitted in response to the<br>
application request message, and extracts the application included in this<br>
message.<br>
(B) Application Download Function<br>
The download helper has the functions of reserving a storage area in the<br>
external memory 607 for storing an application provided by the content server<br>
100 and data to be used by this application, and storing the application into the<br>
reserved storage area. To be more specific, the mobile phone 600 initially<br>
downloads the trusted application provided by the content server 100. Then,<br>
when the CPU 611 receives the instruction to execute the trusted application<br>
transmitted from the content server 100, it executes this trusted application.<br>
Subsequently, the download helper is executed by this trusted application.<br>
The download helper generates an area reservation request message for<br>
reserving a storage area in the external memory 607 for storing the electronic<br>
money application and the electronic money data provided by the content server<br>
100, and transmits it to the area management server 500. This message<br>
includes the terminal identifier stored in the ROM 609 and an application<br>
identifier of the trusted application. When an area reservation instruction<br><br>
message transmitted from the area management server 500 in response to the<br>
area reservation request message is received, this area reservation instruction<br>
message is interpreted by the trusted application in execution.<br>
When the trusted application determines that this area reservation<br>
instruction message is one for instructing to reserve the storage area for storing<br>
the application and data, the download helper is executed to control the external<br>
memory interface unit 608. Consequently, the area for storing the electronic<br>
money application and the electronic money data is reserved in the external<br>
memory 607.<br>
When the storage area is thus reserved in the external memory 607, the<br>
trusted application generates an application request message for downloading<br>
the electronic money application, and transmits it to the content server 100.<br>
This application request message includes the URL for designating the storage<br>
location of the electronic money application, the trusted application containing<br>
the URL.<br>
When the CPU 611 receives the application transmission message<br>
transmitted from the content server 100 in response to the application request<br>
message, it executes the trusted application to extract the electronic money<br>
application included in the application transmission message. Next, the trusted<br>
application executes the download helper. The download helper controls the<br>
external memory interface unit 608 to store the extracted electronic money<br>
application into the external memory 607.<br>
As above, according to the present embodiment, it is impossible to<br>
reserve any storage area in the external memory 607 or to store any application<br>
thereto without using the download helper.<br>
(C) Data Download Function<br>
The access helper is a program having the function of storing the<br>
electronic money data provided by the content server 100 into the external<br>
memory 607.<br><br>
When the user makes a predetermined operation from the mobile phone<br>
600 while the trusted application is in execution, the access helper is executed.<br>
The access helper generates an electronic money request message for requesting<br>
the electronic money data provided by the content server 100, and transmits it to<br>
the content server 100.<br>
When a message transmitted from the content server 100 in response to<br>
the electronic money request message is received, the trusted application<br>
extracts the electronic money data included in the received message.<br>
Subsequently, the access helper is executed to control the external memory<br>
interface unit 608, whereby the electronic money data is stored into the external<br>
memory 607.<br><area management server>
<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing an example of the hardware configuration of<br>
the area management server 500 according to the present embodiment. As<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the components of the area management server 500 are<br>
connected to a bus 501. The individual components of the area management<br>
server 500 exchange data through this bus 501.<br>
A communication unit 502 is an interface for carrying out<br>
communication with the mobile phone 600 via the gateway server 400. An<br>
operation unit 503 is composed of input devices such as a not-shown keyboard<br>
and mouse. The administrator of the area management server 500 enters<br>
various instructions to the area management server 500 from this operation unit<br>
503. Specifically, when operated by the administrator of the area management<br>
server 500, the operation unit 503 supplies signals describing the operations to a<br>
CPU 508. A display 504 has a not-shown liquid crystal display and driver<br>
circuit for driving the liquid crystal display. It displays screens to be provided<br>
to the administrator, such as a menu screen, under the control of the CPU 508.<br>
A storage unit 505 is made of storage devices such as a hard disk. It<br>
contains a data table TB2 shown by way of example in Fig. 6, in which<br><br>
application identifiers, the capacities of storage areas necessary for storing the<br>
corresponding applications (hereinafter, referred to as application area<br>
capacities), and the names of providers providing the applications are stored in<br>
association with one another. In addition, the storage unit 505 contains a<br>
control program for controlling the area management server 500.<br>
A ROM 506 contains an IPL (Initial Program Loader). A RAM 507 is<br>
used as a work area of the CPU 508. Data to be used by the programs executed<br>
by the CPU 508 is temporarily stored therein. When the area management<br>
server 500 is powered on, the CPU 508 reads the IPL from the ROM 506 for<br>
execution. Subsequently, the CPU 508 reads the control program from the<br>
storage unit 505 for execution.<br>
This control program has the function of instructing the mobile phone<br>
600 to reserve a storage area for storing the electronic money application and the<br>
electronic money data provided by the content server 100.<br>
Specifically, when it receives an area reservation request message<br>
transmitted from the mobile phone 600 while the control program is in execution,<br>
the CPU 508 searches the data table TB2 with the application identifier included<br>
in the message as a key. If the appropriate application identifier is found, the<br>
CPU 508 reads the application area capacity corresponding to the application<br>
identifier from the storage unit 505. For example, as shown in Fig. 6, if an<br>
application identifier "BBB001" is included in the area reservation request<br>
message, an application area capacity of "30 kByte" is read. Subsequently, the<br>
CPU 508 generates an area reservation instruction message for instructing to<br>
reserve the storage area for storing the application and data to be used by the<br>
application. Subsequently, the CPU 508 transmits the area reservation<br>
instruction message to the mobile phone that is identified by the terminal<br>
identifier included in the area reservation request message received previously.<br>
As described above, since the area management server 500 is operated<br>
by the communication carrier who operates the mobile packet communication<br><br>
network 300 and is installed inside the mobile packet communication network<br>
300, the confidentiality of the area reservation request message is secured.<br>
2. Operation<br>
Next, an example of operation of the present embodiment will be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
Incidentally, the area management server 500 and the content server 100<br>
shall be powered on in advance. Besides, the mobile phone 600 shall be<br>
powered on in advance, and the OS and the WWW browser be executed to<br>
display the WWW browser screen Ml shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Initially, the user of the mobile phone 600 enters<br>
"http://www.aaa.com/index.html", the URL of a Web page file provided by the<br>
content server 100 having the server name "www.aaa.com", into the text box<br>
intended for URL specification displayed on the screen Ml shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The user makes a click operation on the "Show" button on the same screen.<br>
Then, a page request message for requesting the file of that Web page is<br>
generated (step S101). This page request message includes the terminal<br>
identifier "0*0-***-????" and the entered URL<br>
"http://www.aaa.com/index.html".<br>
The page request message generated is transmitted to the content server 100<br>
specified by "www.aaa.com" via the mobile packet communication network 300<br>
and the Internet 200 (step S102).<br>
When the content server 100 receives this page request message, the file<br>
"index.html" that is specified by the URL included in the page request message<br>
is read from the storage unit 101. Next, a page transmission message including<br>
the read file "index.html" is generated. Besides, from the terminal identifier<br>
included in the page request message, the originating mobile phone 600 is<br>
identified. This page transmission message is transmitted to the identified<br>
mobile phone 600 via the Internet 200 and the mobile packet communication<br>
network 300 (step S103).<br><br><br>
When the page transmission message is received at the mobile phone<br>
600, the file "index.html" included in this page transmission message is<br>
extracted. The WWW browser interprets "index.html", and the screen M2<br>
shown in fig .3 appears on the display 605.<br>
When the user of the mobile phone 600 clicks on the part of the<br>
"Download Application" shown underlined on the WWW browser screen M2,<br>
the URL "http://www.aaa.com/download.html" linked with the "application<br>
download" in the file "index.html" is extracted (step S104). Subsequently, a<br>
page request message for requesting "download.html" designed by the extracted<br>
URL is generated. This page request message includes the terminal identifier<br>
of the mobile phone 600 and the extracted URL. Then, this page request<br>
message is transmitted to the content server 100 which is represented by the<br>
server name "www.aaa.com" (step S105).<br>
When the page request message transmitted from the mobile phone 600<br>
is received at the content server 100, the file "download.html" that is specified<br>
by the URL included in this page request message is read from the storage unit<br>
101. Next, a page transmission message including the read file<br>
"download.html" is generated. Then, this page transmission message is<br>
transmitted to the mobile phone 600 that is identified by the terminal identifier<br>
included in the page request message (step S106).<br>
When the page transmission message is received at the mobile phone<br>
600, the file "download.html" included in this page transmission message is read.<br>
The WWW browser interprets "download.html", and the screen M3 shown in<br>
Fig. 3 appears.<br>
When the user of the mobile phone 600 clicks on the "Yes" button<br>
displayed on the same screen M3, the URL "http://www.aaa.com/trust"<br>
described in "download.html" is extracted. Then, an application request<br>
message for requesting acquisition of the trusted application "trust" that is<br>
specified by the URL is generated (step S107). This application request<br><br>
message includes the terminal identifier and the extracted URL. The<br>
application request message generated is transmitted to the content server 100<br>
represented by the server name "www.aaa.com" (step S108).<br>
When the application request message is received at the content server<br>
100, the application contractor table TB1 stored in the storage unit 101 is<br>
searched with the terminal identifier included in this message as a key. Since<br>
the terminal identifier "0*0-****-????" is already registered on the application<br>
contractor table TB1, the user of the mobile phone 600 is determined to be one<br>
who has signed the use contract for the electronic money application.<br>
Consequently, the trusted application included in the application request<br>
message, or "trust", is read. Subsequently, an application transmission message<br>
including the read "trust" and an execution instruction for the trusted application<br>
is generated. The application transmission message generated is transmitted to<br>
the mobile phone 600 that is identified by the terminal identifier included in the<br>
application request message (step S109).<br>
When the application transmission message is received at the mobile<br>
phone 600, the trusted application included in the message is stored into the<br>
storage unit 606 (step S110). Subsequently, "trust" is executed according to the<br>
execution instruction for this trusted application. Subsequently, the download<br>
helper is executed to generate an area reservation request message for reserving<br>
a storage area in the external memory 607 for storing the electronic money<br>
application "shopping" and the electronic money data. This message includes<br>
the terminal identifier and the application identifier "AAA001" of the electronic<br>
money application. This message is transmitted from the mobile phone 600 to<br>
the area management server 500 (step S111).<br>
When the area reservation request message is received at the area<br>
management server 500, the data table TB2 stored in the storage unit 505 of the<br>
area management server 500 is searched with the application identifier included<br>
in this message as a key. Then, the corresponding application area capacity "10<br><br>
KBytes" is read.<br>
Next, the area management server 500 generates an area reservation<br>
instruction message including the read application area capacity. This message<br>
is transmitted to the mobile phone 600 that is identified by the terminal identifier<br>
included in the area reservation request message (step S112).<br>
When the area reservation instruction message is received at the mobile<br>
phone 600, the trusted application determines that this area reservation<br>
instruction message is to instruct of the reservation of the storage area for<br>
storing an application and data to be used by the application. Then, the trusted<br>
application controls the external memory interface unit 608 by using the<br>
download helper, so that an area of "10 KBytes" for storing the application<br>
program "shopping" and the electronic money data to be used by "shopping" is<br>
reserved in the external memory 607 (step S113). Next, the trusted application<br>
generates an application request message including the URL<br>
"http://www.aaa.com/shopping" of the electronic money application and the<br>
terminal identifier. This message is transmitted from the mobile phone 600 to<br>
the content server 100 that provides "shopping" (step S114).<br>
When the application request message is received at the content server<br>
100, the application contractor table TB1 stored in the storage unit 101 is<br>
searched with the terminal identifier included in this message as a key. Since<br>
the terminal identifier "0*0-****-????" is already registered on the application<br>
contractor table TB1, the user of the mobile phone 600 is determined to be one<br>
who has signed the use contract for the electronic money application.<br>
Consequently, "shopping" which is specified by the URL included in the<br>
application request message is read from the storage unit 101. Subsequently,<br>
an application transmission message including the read electronic money<br>
application is generated. This message is transmitted to the mobile phone 600<br>
that is identified by the terminal identifier included in the application request<br>
message (step S115).<br><br>
When the application transmission message is received at the mobile<br>
phone 600, the trusted application extracts the electronic money application<br>
"shopping" included in the message. Subsequently, the download helper is<br>
executed to store the extracted "shopping" into the storage area reserved in the<br>
external memory 607 (step S116). Subsequently, the screen M4 shown in Fig.<br>
3, indicating the completion of the download of the electronic money application,<br>
appears on the display 605.<br>
When the user of the mobile phone 600 makes an operation for acquiring<br>
the electronic money data provided by the content server 100 (step S117), the<br>
trusted application generates an electronic money request message for<br>
requesting the electronic money data. This message includes the terminal<br>
identifier, and is transmitted from the mobile phone 600 to the content server<br>
100 (step S118).<br>
When the electronic money request message is received at the content<br>
server 100, the application contractor table TB1 stored in the storage unit 101 is<br>
searched with the terminal identifier included in this message as a key. Since<br>
the terminal identifier "0*0-****-????" is registered on the application<br>
contractor table TB1, the user of the mobile phone 600 is determined to be one<br>
who has signed the use contract for the electronic money application. Thus, an<br>
electronic money transmission message including the electronic money data on a<br>
predetermined amount of money is generated. This message is transmitted<br>
from the content server 100 to the mobile phone 600 that is identified by the<br>
terminal identifier included in the electronic money request message (step S119).<br>
When the electronic money transmission message is received at the<br>
mobile phone 600, the electronic money data on the predetermined amount of<br>
money, included in this message, is extracted by the trusted application. The<br>
access helper is executed to store the extracted electronic money data into the<br>
external memory 607 (step S120).<br>
As described above, the present embodiment is configured so that the<br><br>
device driver necessary for accessing the external memory 607, including the<br>
download helper and the access helper, cannot be used unless the execution<br>
instructions are given from the area management server 500 and the content<br>
server 100. It is therefore possible to prevent applications and data stored in<br>
the external memory from being tampered or erased by using the device driver<br>
from a downloaded application. In addition, since appropriate storage areas are<br>
reserved for respective applications, it is possible to use the storage areas of the<br>
external memory efficiently.<br>
3. Modification<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the applications and data downloaded<br>
from the content server 100 are stored into the external memory 607 in<br>
unencrypted form. Nevertheless, the mobile phone 600 may encrypt the<br>
applications and data when it stores the applications and data into the external<br>
memory 607.<br>
The external memory 607 may also be accessed with a key all the time.<br>
Specifically, this key is held in the area management server 500. When the<br>
area management server 500 receives the area reservation request message from<br>
the mobile phone 600, it attaches this key to the area reservation instruction<br>
message. The mobile phone 600 accesses the external memory 607 by using<br>
this key. The external memory 607 cannot be accessed if no key is attached or<br>
if the key is unauthorized. This improves the security of the mobile phone 600<br>
further.<br>
Among IC cards available for use as the external memory are a contact<br>
type which requires contact with the interface at the time of access and a<br>
noncontact type which requires no contact. Either type of IC card may be used<br>
in the present invention.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the mobile phone 600 receives the trusted<br>
application and the execution instruction for this trusted application together.<br>
Nevertheless, the execution instruction may be given so that the trusted<br><br>
application is executed automatically by the mobile phone 600. In this case,<br>
for example, the content server makes the mobile phone 600 acquire<br>
predetermined data indicating that this application is the trusted application, at<br>
the time of download. The mobile phone 600 shall perform the downloaded<br>
application automatically only when it receives this data.<br>
The foregoing embodiment has dealt with the mobile phone 600 as an<br>
example of the terminal for downloading applications. It is understood,<br>
however, that this terminal is not limited to a mobile phone, but may be such<br>
mobile communication terminals as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) as long<br>
as they can access the mobile packet communication network 300.<br>
The mobile phone 600 may be provided with the facilities of executing<br>
programs written in accordance with the Java (TM) programming language, so<br>
that the trusted application and the electronic money application are written in<br>
accordance with the Java programming language.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the trusted application is provided by the<br>
content server 100. Nevertheless, the contents may be provided by the area<br>
management server 500. To be more specific, the provider who operates the<br>
content server 100 initially provides the trusted application to the<br>
communication carrier who operates the area management server 500. This<br>
communication carrier verifies that this trusted application is not unauthorized<br>
one, and then stores it into the storage unit 505. Consequently, all the contents<br>
are provided from the trusted application to the mobile phone 600.<br>
According to such an embodiment, the applications provided to the<br>
mobile phone 600 are checked for reliability by the area management server 500.<br>
This prevents the content server 100 from updating or otherwise modifying the<br>
trusted application freely. As a result, it becomes possible, for example, to<br>
monitor unauthorized acts such as tempering on the trusted application disguised<br>
as upgrading. This improves the security of the mobile phone 600 further.<br>
Moreover, even if a trusted application that makes unauthorized<br><br>
operation is discovered, the communication carrier can stop the provision of the<br>
application to the mobile phone 600 immediately. Consequently, even if some<br>
unauthorized application is already provided to the mobile phone 600, it is<br>
possible to suppress the damage to a minimum.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the trusted application downloaded from<br>
the content server 100 to the mobile phone 600 performs the area reservation in<br>
the external memory 607 and the download of the electronic money application<br>
and the electronic money data. Nevertheless, the trusted application may be<br>
configured to perform the download of applications and data to be used by the<br>
applications alone. In this case, for example, a trusted application dedicated to<br>
the management of storage areas may be downloaded to the mobile phone 600<br>
in advance so that area reservation is always performed by using this trusted<br>
application intended for area reservation. In this case, the content server 100 is<br>
not involved in the process of area reservation. This makes it substantially<br>
impossible for the content server 100 to conduct unauthorized processing on the<br>
external memory, thereby improving the security of the mobile phone 600<br>
further.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the download helper is stored in the ROM<br>
609 of the mobile phone 600 and is configured unchangeable. Nevertheless,<br>
the download helper may be rendered capable of being updated when needed.<br>
To be more specific, in the foregoing embodiment where the area<br>
management server 500 provides the trusted application for performing area<br>
management alone, the function of the download helper is given to the trusted<br>
application. Then, the trusted application having this function is downloaded<br>
from the area management server 500. According to such an embodiment, it<br>
becomes possible to upgrade the function of the download helper while securing<br>
the reliability on the external memory 607.<br>
It is understood that the application of the method of the present<br>
embodiment is not limited to the external memory. The storage areas for<br><br>
storing applications and data to be used by the applications may be reserved in a<br>
nonvolatile memory built in the mobile phone 600, such as a flash memory.<br>
Moreover, the external memory may be configured undetachable.<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, the area reservation instruction message<br>
transmitted from the area management server 500 includes the information on<br>
the storage area capacity. Nevertheless, the area management server 500 may<br>
transmit the specification on the capacity of the storage area and the instruction<br>
for the reservation of the storage area to the mobile phone 600 separately.<br>
Moreover, in the foregoing embodiment, the trusted application<br>
interprets the area reservation instruction message, and carries out the<br>
reservation of the storage area by using the download helper. However, the<br>
method of interpreting the area reservation instruction message is not limited to<br>
this method. For example, the download helper may take charge of both the<br>
interpretation of the area reservation instruction message and the reservation of<br>
the storage area.<br>
Furthermore, in the foregoing embodiment, the accesses of the mobile<br>
phone to the external memory are managed by using the trusted application, an<br>
application whose reliability is secured in advance. Nevertheless, any<br>
application may be used if what is intended is only the efficient use of the<br>
storage area in situations where no consideration needs to be given to security<br>
problems. For example, some area of the external memory may be configured<br>
accessible by using applications other than reliability-secured trusted<br>
applications.<br>

In a mobile phone 600, a trusted application and a download helper are<br>
executed to generate an area reservation request message for requesting reservation of<br>
a storage area for storing a program, data, and the like. This message is transmitted to<br>
an area management server 500. When the area management server 500 receives the<br>
area reservation message, it transmits an area reservation instruction message to the<br>
