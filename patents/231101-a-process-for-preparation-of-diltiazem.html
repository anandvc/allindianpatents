				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF DILTIAZEM<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of diltiazem by first synthesizing (2R,3S)-(-)-Ethyl-2,3-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate with greater than 99% enantioselectivity and devoid of osmium even in a crude form in a single pot using recyclable multifunctional catalysis ol' the formula lE-IE-PdOsW, in which IE is a ion-exchanger comprising LDH, quaternary ammonium salt anchored on silica, clay, alumina, magnesia or resin, converting the diol obtained without further crystallization into cyclic sulfite and reacting the cyclic sulfite with 2-aminothiophenol in the presence of Fe.sup.3+ -exchanged clay in xylene to obtain a cyclic lactam which is then subjected to N-alkylation and acylation to provide diltiazem.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Diltiazem, a typical calcium antagonist, has been used throughout the world as a remedy for angina and hypertension. Among the four possible stereoisomers of diltiazem, only the (+)-(2S,3S)-isomer exhibits potent coronary vasodilating activity. Therefore, diltiazem has been developed and marketed as a single isomer. For the synthesis of diltiazem, many processes have been extensively investigated and at present it is mainly manufactured by the route using the optically active (-)-trans methyl glycidate as a key intermediate, which is prepared via enzymatic methods. However, there is an inherent drawback to the optical resolution in that the maximum yield of one enantiomer cannot exceed 50%. Although several approaches for the asymmetric synthesis of diltiazem have been reported, for reasons involving enantiomeric purity and overall efficiency, a more efficient method is needed.<br>
Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,697, (1999) wherein synthesis of diltiazem was carried out by using optically pure chiral diols. The inherent disadvantage is the optically pure diols used are expensive involving tedious experimental procedures. Reference is also made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,785 (2001) wherein synthesis of diltiazem was carried out by using optically pure chiral diols. The inherent disadvantage is the optically pure diols used are expensive, involving tedious experimental procedures.<br>
Reference is made to J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 851 wherein optically active trans-phenylglycidic acid ester is prepared using chiral auxiliary followed by a stereoselective opening of the epoxide by various substituted aminothiophenols to<br><br><br>
give the desired intermediate ester for diltiazem. The inherent disadvantage is the use of stoichiometric amount of chiral auxiliary. Reference is also made to Tetrahedron Lett. 2001, 42, 1313 wherein optically active trans-phenylglycidic acid ester is prepared via chiral oxazaborolidine-mediated Mukaiyama aldol reaction followed by reduction and cyclization. The inherent disadvantage is the use of stoichiometric amount of expensive reagent.<br>
Reference is made to J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 6730 wherein optically active diols were prepared via enantioselective lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of threo-diacetate ethyl ester which leads to (+)-diltiazem precursors (2S,3R)-diol and (2R,3S)-diol. The inherent disadvantage is the recovery of entire toxic osmium tetroxide to prepare threo-diol ester. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of diltiazem that comprises the following steps: (a) Synthesis of (2R, 3S)-(-)-Ethyl-2,3-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate with greater than 99% enantioselectivity and devoid of osmium even in the crude in a single pot using recyclable multifunctional catalysts of the formula IE- IB-PdOsW, in which IE is a ion-exchanger comprising LDH, quaternary ammonium salt anchored on silica, clay, alumina, magnesia or resin (b) conversion of the diol thus obtained without further crystallization into cyclic sulfite using standard protocol, (c) cyclic sulfite on reaction with 2-aminothiophenol in the presence of Fe3+-exchanged clay in xylene at 120-140°C gave the cyclic lactam, (d) cyclic lactam was in turn subjected for N-alkylation, and acylation to afford diltiazem.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a novel and ecofriendly process for synthesis of (2R, 3S)-(-)-Ethyl-2,3-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate from 4-haloanisole and ethyl acrylate in a single pot using a multifunctional catalyst.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of diltia/em wherein the work-up procedure is simple.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of diltiazem wherein the catalyst is capable of being recycled with consistent activity.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
The present invention comprises a simplified synthesis of (+)-diltiazem through IE-PdOsW wherein IE is ion-exchanger, catalyzed three-component coupling reaction and Fe.sup.3+ -exchanged clay catalyzed ring opening of sulfite with 2-aminothiophenol followed by cyclization as key steps.<br>
The lE-PdOsW catalyzes the one pot synthesis of optically pure diol starting from 4-iodoanisole and ethyl acrylate using H.sub.2 O.sub.2 as a terminal oxidant. The diol was converted to the corresponding sulfite and upon reaction with 2-aminothiophenol in the presence of Fe.sup.3+ -exchanged clay in xylene at 120-140.degree. C. gave the cyclic lactam. N-alkylation, followed by acylation of lactam gave the diltiazem in 37% overall yield. It is significant to note that Fe.sup.3+ -exchanged clay was used for this purpose as a new variant to the conventional acid catalysts to obtain quantitative yields.<br>

Washing cycles were repeated until disappearance of Cl" ions from the discarded water. The clay was dried overnight in an oven at 120° C and finely ground in a mortar.<br>
Example 2: Experimental procedure for the synthesis of diltiazem a) Synthesis of (2R, 3S)-(-)-Ethyl-2r3-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate<br>
LDH-PdOsW (0.4g, 0.1 mmol), 4-iodoanisole (lOmmol), ethyl aery late (lOmmol) and EtsN (llmmol) were stirred at 70°C for 16h under nitrogen atmosphere.

useftil in catalyzing three different reactions by generating the precursors, prochiral olefins and NMO for AD reaction in situ from the readily available cheaper starting materials such as ethyl acrylate and 4-haloanisole and hence saves the energy and time, which are vital for a better and economical process.<br>
3.   Multifunctional catalysts are prepared and used as heterogeneous catalysts for synthesis   of (2R,   3S)-(-)-Ethyl-2,3-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate chiral diols. Use of heterogeneous multifunctional atalysts precludes the presence of osmium in the product.<br>
-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionate obtained using heterogeneous multifunctional catalyst was put to direct use in the synthesis of ditiazem without any further crystallization.<br>
5.   Reusable Fe3+-clay is used to prepare hydroxy lactam.<br>
6.   The enantioselectivity and the yields obtained are higher than reported in homogeneous dihydroxylation.<br>
