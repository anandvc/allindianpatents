Further, the invention is concerned with a process and an intermediate for the manufacture of the above compounds, pharmaceutical preparations which contain such compounds, the use of these compounds for the production of pharmaceutical preparations as well as a process for the manufacture of the intermediate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are active compounds and inhibit the coagulation factor Xa. These compounds consequently influence blood coagulation. They therefore inhibit the formation of thrombin and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of thrombotic disorders, such as amongst others, arterial and venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, stroke (cerebral thrombosis) due to atrial fibrillation, inflammation and arteriosclerosis. They have potentially benefit in the treatment of acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and restenosis, e.g. after transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass grafting of the coronary or peripheral arteries and in the maintenance of vascular access patency in long term hemodialysis patients. F.Xa inhibitors of this invention may form part of a combination therapy with an anticoagulant with a different mode of action or with<br><br>
a platelet aggregation inhibitor or with a thrombolytic agent. Furthermore, these compounds have an effect on tumour cells and prevent metastases. They can therefore also be used as antitumour agents.<br>
Other inhibitors of factor Xa had previously been suggested for the inhibition of the formation of thrombin and for the treatment of related diseases. However, there is still a need for novel factor Xa inhibitors which exhibit improved pharmacological properties, e.g. an improved selectivity towards thrombin.<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I) which are factor Xa inhibitors. The compounds of the present invention unexpectedly inhibit coagulation factor Xa and also exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to other compounds already known in the art.<br>

Compounds of formula (I) can form pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts of compounds of formula (I) with physiologically compatible mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, sulphurous acid or phosphoric acid; or with organic acids, such as methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid or salicylic acid. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to such salts. Compounds of formula (I) in which a COOH group is present can further form salts with bases. Examples of such salts are alkaline, earth-alkaline and ammonium salts such as e.g. Na-, K-, Ca- and trimethylammoniumsalt. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" also refers to such salts. Acid addition salts as described above are preferred.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "aryl group optionally substituted with an alkyl group" means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the aryl group is substituted with an alkyl group and situations where the aryl group is not substituted with the alkyl group*<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such excipient<br>
Compounds that have the same molecular Formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers." Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror<br><br>
images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, if a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof, A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can possess one or more asymmetric centers. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992).<br>

The inhibition of the coagulation factor Xa by the compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated with the aid of a chromogenic peptide substrate assay as described hereinafter.<br>
Factor Xa activity was measured spectrophotometrically in microtiter plates in a final volume of 150 \xl using the following conditions: Inhibition of human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was tested at an enzyme concentration of 3<br><br>
nM using the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix AB, Molndal, Sweden) at 200 nM, The reaction kinetics of the enzyme and the substrate were linear with both time and the enzyme concentration. The inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and tested at various concentrations up to 100 jxM. The inhibitors were diluted using HNPT buffer consisting of HEPES lOOmM, NaCl 140mM, PEG 6000 0.1% and Tween 80 0.02%, pH 7.8. The cleavage of S-2222 by human factor Xa was followed at 405 nm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The velocity of the reaction was determined by the autoreader from the slope of the linear regression fit to 7 time points (1 minute). The initial velocity for each inhibitor concentration was determined by the slope of at least 4 time points in the linear phase by a linear regression fit (mOD/min2). Apparent dissociation constants Ki were calculated according to Cheng and Prusoff [Cheng, Y. C; Prusoff, W. H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (Kj) and the concentration of the inhibitor that causes 50 percent inhibition (IC50) of an enzyme reaction. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973, 22, 3099-3108.] based on the IC50 and the respective Km, determined previously (K, = IC1-6 (1+S/Km)), The Km for the substrate used was determined under the conditions of the test with at least 5 substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 times K^. [Lottenberg R, Hall J A, Blinder M, Binder EP, Jackson CM., The action of thrombin on peptide p-nitroanilide substrates. Substrate selectivity and examination of hydrolysis under different reaction conditions. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Feb 15; 742(3):539-57]. According to Eadie [Eadie G.S. The inhibition of cholinesterase by physostigmine and prostigmine. J. Biol. Chem. 1942, 146, 85-93.], the Km for S-2222 amounted to 613 \iM.<br>
The activity of the low molecular weight substances can, moreover, be characterized in the "prothrombin time" (PT) clotting test. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent. Thereafter, 0.25 ml of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) was placed in the instrument-specific sample container. In each case 5 jil of each dilution of the substance-dilution series was then mixed with the plasma provided. This plasma/inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 minutes.   Thereafter, there<br><br>
were pipetted to the semi-automatic device (ACL, Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Instrument Laboratory)) 50 |j,l of plasma/ inhibitor mixture in the measurement container. The clotting reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of Dade® Innovin® (recombinant human tissue factor combined with calcium buffer and synthetic phospholipids, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4212-50), The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the PT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can furthermore be characterised by the Activated Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT). This coagulation test can e.g. be run on the ACL 300 Coagulation System (Instrumentation Laboratory) automatic analyzer. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent. The test is performed with the Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent (purified soy phosphatides in l.OxlO^M ellagic acid, stabilizers and preservative, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4218-100), Thereafter, 0.25 ml aliquots of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) are spiked with 5 \i\ of test compound in at least 6 concentrations. 50 \i\ plasma at 4 °C containing 1/50 vol. inhibitor in solvent are incubated with 50 \x\ Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent in water at 37 °C for 3 min,, then 50 \il CaCl2.2H20 25 mM in water at 37 °C are added* The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the APTT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The Ki values of the active compounds of the present invention preferably amount to about 0.001 to 50 \*M, especially about 0.001 to 1 pM. The PT values preferably amount to about 0.5 to 100 faM, especially to about 0.5 to 10 \xM. The aPTT values preferably amount to about 0.5 to 100 fxM, especially to about 0.5 to 10|JVl.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and<br><br>
liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants,<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about 1 to 300 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br><br>
