This invention in general rdaites to the sdf actuating, hydraitically controlled Ball Valve Ddivery S^;tan in FUel Ihjecti
PRIOR ART:<br>
A conventional Delivery Valve (DV) system has two componcftfs, nandy valve body and valve pin. In a fued injection pump, the DV bocfy talces a seating on the ground and lapped flat surface of the element band cotlar ntd there by ensires a hard meta! fat^ fn-essure sealing The vatve pin has four flutes in the guide shafto as to provide a separtfe passage fiM- the flow of fiid. The pin by virtue of guide shaftves freely in Uie valve body. The pin has a variable lengh retraction collar, vrfiich is ground to an accurate diameter, mtfchii^ perfectly wth the vatve botfy diamder. Ttie radial durance between the valve body &amp; vdve fan are of the mder of 2-4 niawis. In tlie Vdve pin, above the rdief collar, there is a conical ground suiface which takes seating on to die vatve body and provides the perfect seating The valve pin is always pressed on to its seat on the valve body by a weak compression spring When die pressure of the fiuel in the Pump dement chamber exceeds the opening i»-essure of tlie Vdve pin (Force exerted by the spring), the valve ptn liAs up and dlows the fud to flow into the H^ Pressure Pipe (HPP) aid Injector. After the end of injection, the [n-essuredrops down, the nozzle in the iryector closes and the fiid starts flowing t»ck towards the elemat, pushmg the vdve pin to the valve seat The pressure build -up due to the sudden closure of the valve pin and the possible secmid time injection will be avoided by the addkiond space treded by the re(raction collar in the DV diamber diring the closure of the pia<br><br>

DESCRIPTIOS OF THE INVKKTION ;<br>
The ball valve delivery system as par the invmtton consists of a hardened and polished sted bril. the said stee) ball tdces a sealing directly in to the cMinter sak nude on the top of the b«rd of the [ximp demat. The said steel ball is qxing - loaded to ensure that 11% fiiel flow takes i^ace in uni-direction, that is fixun demert chamber towards the valve holder and tiot vice versa. In the new invoition, the effect of rdief volume will be achieved by the niodificati<xi of the hf pipe whi is a nmmal application variable. this achieved by either increasing qie tengfii or imer diameter hi pressure till tlk re ddiveiy characteristics are wueved. new cmcept diminates need complicated sub assemuy ddivwy valve body and frin also helps in recbcing over dl aze></xi>
A simple ball valve is provided for use on a craE^ant speed diced ei^inee, to achieve tf» ncMi-retum function of the conventional ddivery valve system. As fllustrated m Fig. 2, the ball valve assemUy comprises of a hardened and polished d^d ball v4ach k spring loaded Tht said ball is accommodated in the eourter sink provided on die top of the baod of pump dement A com|»v^on spring placed directly above the said ball holds the said ball down until ^ pressure in element diamber CKceeds a {nre-defined levtA. Ihe valve holder has got extant ttreads and the pump housing h^ matdiing internal tiveada The bard is pressed against its seat in the pump hmsing when the vdve bolder is tightened to Uie specified torque levd into the pump hnising- The o-riqg [rovided on the valve holder will ensure that there is no leakage of &amp;el bdween the threads of valve holder and the pump housing The brraize gasket placed bctvraen tltt vd ve holder and the dement ban-d gets squeezed and jHOVides perfect sedii^ when the valve holder is screwed on to tlw housing tha-e by in'events the loss of hi^ pressire generated. Thffe is adequate flow 8re&amp; incoiporated between the said ball tnd die fauur bore of the valve holder so that the flow of presairised fiid takes place smoofiily and wtthout throttlBig.<br><br>
As sudt the said Ball Vdve system accordng to the invmtton herein ensures the non¬return function of a con^%nti(»iat delivery valve, while avoiding the need of complicated sub-assemtdy and further reducing mderial wastage, reducing tt» size of fuel iiyection pun^, towering the cost of produ(Ai(»i and maintenuice and lessenii^ the production time and expertise.

As per the invention from Fig. 2 the Ball valve delivery i^stcm ccnqirises of a hardened and polished sted ball (1) seated in the counter ank (4) jHovided in the barrd (3) placed in the punp housing (8). A conqression qning (2) is placed on top of the said ball holds the said 1^1 tig^y down on to its seat in the barrd utAil the pressure exceeds a pre-defined lerol. The dearatce (10) between the ball and the oettral btx'e in valve holder (5) provides the required lk)w passfige, as soon as the ball lifts up. The said ball moves up, if the pressure in dw pump demoit chamber (9) exceeds the spnng pressure on the said ball. Hi^ pressire scaling between the valve holder and pump housing is assured by the bronze gasket (T). The low pressure ceding between the threaded joints of pun^ housii^ and vdve holder is ensured with the hdp of rubber o^ng (6&gt;<br>
COMPARBION OF TECHNICAL FEATURES OF THE INVENTION WITH RESPECT TO THB PRIOR ART IN THE FIELD;<br>
As per file invei^on, the plungpr of the fUd mjeotion pump has the same features as in the known existing ait.<br><br>
As per the inventicm, tie ddtvcry vi^ve body and the valve pin of the fiiel iiyection IKimp in tiie exi^ng art has been dinuiaUd and rq)laced by a hardened and polished steel b^l of suit^le diameter. Tlw bril diameter will be decided based on the phmger dioneter and the extent of imnwrskm into the pomp element barrd.<br>
As per the inventicm, therefractiiHi volume of 35 or 30 mn? in the ddivery valve system of the existir^ art is completely dinvnated.<br>
As per the inveition, thet^eiing pressure of the foel iiuection pump is same as in the known existii^ art.<br>
As per the invention, the UAal heigtt of Ihe pump from the flangB arface has been reduced from 122 mm to 113 mm.<br>
