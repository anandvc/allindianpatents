Apparatus and methods for scatter correction in projection<br>
radiography, particularly mammography<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for projection<br>
radiography comprising a radiation source, a detector and,<br>
downstream of said detector, a processing unit which uses the<br>
projection data supplied by the detector to approximately<br>
determine the scatter material distribution of the object<br>
under examination and which reads out scatter information from<br>
a data memory as a function of the scatter material<br>
distribution and corrects the projection data in respect of<br>
the scatter component on the basis of said scatter<br>
information.<br>
The invention further relates to a method with scatter<br>
correction for projection radiography and a method for<br>
obtaining scatter information.<br>
An apparatus and methods of this kind are known from US<br>
6,104,777 A.<br>
The scatter produced in the object under examination (breast),<br>
the intensity of which may almost attain the order of<br>
magnitude of the direct, unscattered, image-producing primary<br>
radiation, results in image quality impairment by reducing the<br>
contrast, increasing the noise, and ultimately in respect of<br>
the image post-processing methods used for differentiating<br>
between various types of tissue in the images produced, in<br>
particular between glandular and fatty tissue in the breast.<br>
For differentiation in respect of two tissue types, techniques<br>
using a single energy spectrum, i.e. a single x-ray tube<br><br>
voltage, or the dual energy method using two voltage values<br>
are known in mammography. In both cases scatter compensation<br>
is required; with the dual energy method this is also because<br>
the amount of scatter is different in the two energy spectra.<br>
To reduce scatter, mechanical measures have already been<br>
proposed. The use of slit collimators requires mechanical<br>
displacement of the slit collimators over the breast<br>
measuring field and is therefore time-consuming. Anti-scatter<br>
grids not only reduce the scatter, but also the imaging-<br>
producing primary radiation. Arguments in favor of dispensing<br>
with anti-scatter grids have been ongoing for years. For<br>
compression thicknesses of less than 4-5 cm, the dose could<br>
even be reduced or the SNR (= signal-to-noise ratio)<br>
increased if the grid is removed. On the other hand there are<br>
applications in which it is not technically possible to use a<br>
grid, e.g. in tomosynthesis.<br>
A large number of computer correction methods have already<br>
been proposed. Methods of this kind are known e.g. from M.<br>
DARBOUX, J.M. DINTEN: Physical model based scatter correction<br>
in mammography. In: Proc. SPIE, Vol. 3032, 1997, pages 405 to<br>
410 and from J.M. DINTEN and J.M. VOLLE: Physical model based<br>
restoration of mammographies. In. Proc. SPIE, Vol. 3336,<br>
1998, pages 641 to 650 and in US 6,104,777 A. These are<br>
convolution/deconvolution methods in which a scatter<br>
intensity distribution is approximated as a convolution of<br>
the primary radiation distribution using suitable convolution<br>
kernels . In the cited documents an analytical model is thus<br>
proposed with which the physical scatter process in the<br>
scatter object (breast) is explicitly computed as an integral<br>
transformation. However, this explicit analytical<br>
representation only describes first-order scatter, not<br><br>
multiple scatter. The intensity distribution of multiply<br>
scattered photons is assumed to be a spatially constant<br>
background over the detector surface and must be estimated<br>
from previously determined tables. The analytical model for<br>
calculating just the first-order scatter contribution<br>
requires 4-dimensional numerical integrations (3 space<br>
coordinates + energy spectrum) for each detector pixel, i.e.<br>
it is compute-intensive. Approximations are therefore<br>
required in order to reduce the computational complexity.<br>
Because of the high computational complexity it is proposed<br>
to perform the calculations in advance and tabulate the<br>
results.<br>
In addition, W. KALENDER: Monte Carlo calculations of x-ray<br>
scatter data for diagnostic radiology. In: Phys. Med. Biol.,<br>
1981, Vol. 26, No. 5, pages 835 to 849 describes the use of<br>
Monte Carlo methods for simulating radiation propagation in<br>
radiography.<br>
Proceeding from this prior art, the object of the invention<br>
is therefore to specify an apparatus and methods enabling<br>
improved scatter correction compared to the prior art to be<br>
performed.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus and the methods<br>
having the features set forth in the independent claims.<br>
Advantageous further developments and embodiments are set<br>
forth in claims dependent thereon.<br>
With the apparatus and method, the projection images supplied<br>
by a detector are analyzed in a processing unit. It is first<br>
attempted to approximately determine the scatter material<br>
distribution, in mammography typically the proportions of<br><br>
glandular and fatty tissue, of an object under examination.<br>
In another processing step, scatter information depending on<br>
the scatter material distribution is read out of a data<br>
memory. This scatter information can then be used to correct<br>
the projection images in respect of the scatter content of<br>
said projection images, it being essential that the scatter<br>
information read out of the data memory has been determined<br>
in advance by a Monte Carlo simulation which takes the<br>
multiple interaction of the photons with the object under<br>
examination into account.<br>
The basis for the solution described here is optimally<br>
correct physical modeling. In contrast to the prior art,<br>
modeling is possible which takes a much larger number of<br>
details into account, namely in the following respect: the<br>
occurrence of multiple scatter and polychromasia and the<br>
geometrical relationships, in particular the peculiarities of<br>
the scatter distribution at the edges of the objects, can be<br>
simulated. During the scatter correction itself, merely table<br>
access is required, possibly with subsequent interpolation,<br>
and the calculation of the scatter distribution in the<br>
detector plane is reduced to 2-dimensional integrations over<br>
the detector plane. Despite the relatively simple<br>
implementation of the scatter correction, the procedure is<br>
not limited to special cases and requires no drastic<br>
simplifications or approximations, such as simplified<br>
acquisition geometry, monochromatized radiation,<br>
simplifications of the physical model or a Taylor development<br>
by orders of approximation or similar.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the scatter material distribution<br>
is specifically determined for different regions of the<br>
projection image. To perform scatter correction in an image<br><br>
region, the scatter contributions of the surrounding<br>
contributions which depend on the specific scatter material<br>
distribution are then determined and corrected accordingly.<br>
In this way it is possible to take local scatter variations<br>
into account.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, in the region of the edges<br>
of the object under examination, scatter information which<br>
takes the particular geometrical relationships in the region<br>
of the object edge into account is used for scatter<br>
correction.<br>
The scatter information is preferably obtained under the<br>
assumption that the scatter material distribution is<br>
homogeneous along the radiation direction. Particularly in<br>
the context of mammography, such an assumption only results<br>
in slight deviations from the actual scatter distribution.<br>
The specific scatter information associated with an image<br>
area can also be calculated under the assumption that the<br>
object under examination is also homogeneously structured in<br>
the direction perpendicular to the beam, thereby simplifying<br>
the calculation of the scatter information.<br>
However, if particularly high accuracy in calculating the<br>
scatter information is required, any inhomogeneity<br>
perpendicular to the beam direction can be taken into<br>
account.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the scatter material distribution<br>
is determined by analyzing the ratio of incident radiation<br>
intensity to the unscattered primary radiation in an image<br>
region, the values for the primary radiation being<br><br>
ascertained by means of a scatter correction based on the<br>
scatter information associated with a characteristic<br>
homogeneous scatter material distribution.<br>
The processing steps carried out by the processing unit can<br>
also be executed iteratively, the calculated primary<br>
radiation components being used to simplify the approximate<br>
calculation of the scatter components and thus arrive at<br>
improved values for the primary radiation.<br>
The scatter correction does not generally need to be<br>
performed at full detector resolution. It may occasionally be<br>
sufficient to perform scatter correction at selected grid<br>
points and interpolate between the determined scatter<br>
correction values at the selected grid points.<br>
Further advantages and embodiments of the invention will<br>
emerge from the following description in which examples of<br>
the invention are specifically explained with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the configuration	of a mammography machine<br>
in which a breast under	examination is compressed<br>
between two compression	plates and irradiated<br>
with x-radiation;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a simplified breast structure assumed<br>
for calculating the scatter correction;<br>
Figure 3 shows a flowchart of a method performed for<br>
scatter correction;<br><br>
Figure 4 shows the breast tissue distribution assumed for<br>
calculating a simple scatter beam spread<br>
function; and<br>
Figure 5 shows the breast structure assumed for<br>
calculating a precise scatter beam spread<br>
function.<br>
Figure 1 shows the configuration of a mammography machine 1<br>
in which x-radiation 3 is produced with the aid of a<br>
radiation source 2. The divergence of the x-radiation 3 is<br>
limited if necessary using a collimator 4 which is shown in<br>
Figure 1 as a single beam diaphragm. However, the collimator<br>
4	can also be contrived such that a plurality of virtually<br>
parallel x-ray beams is produced. Such a collimator 4 can be<br>
implemented e.g. as an iris diaphragm.<br>
The mammography machine 1 additionally has compression plates<br>
5	between which a breast 6 is compressed. The x-radiation 3<br>
passes through the compression plates 5 and the breast 6 and<br>
generally crosses an air gap 7 before the x-radiation 3 is<br>
incident on an x-ray detector 8 comprising a plurality of<br>
individual detector elements 9, the so-called detector<br>
pixels.<br>
The portion of x-radiation 3 passing through the breast 6<br>
without interacting with the breast 6 is known as the primary<br>
radiation 10. On the other hand, the portions of x-radiation<br>
3 incident on the x-ray detector 8 after at least one<br>
scattering within the breast 6 are referred to as secondary<br>
radiation 11.<br><br>
It should be noted that the term scatter is to be understood<br>
as any kind of interaction between the x-radiation 3 and the<br>
material of the breast 6 causing a change in the propagation<br>
direction of the photons of the x-radiation 3.<br>
Since, as mentioned in the introduction, the secondary<br>
radiation 11 may considerably distort the structure of the<br>
breast 6 imaged by the primary radiation 10, it is<br>
advantageous if the secondary radiation 11 can be removed<br>
from the projection images of the breast 6 captured by the x-<br>
ray detector 8. For this purpose, a processing unit 12<br>
connected downstream of the x-ray detector 8 performs a<br>
scatter correction. In order to be able to perform the<br>
scatter correction, model assumptions are made concerning the<br>
structure of the breast 6. In particular it is assumed that<br>
the tissue structure of the breast 6 which is essentially<br>
composed of glandular and fatty tissue can be described by a<br>
homogeneous tissue distribution along the propagation<br>
direction of the x-radiation 3. Figure 2 accordingly shows<br>
different regions 13, 14 and 15 in the breast 6 whose<br>
different shadings are designed to illustrate different<br>
amounts of fatty and glandular tissue along the propagation<br>
direction of the x-radiation 3. In the context of projection<br>
radiography, this constitutes a simplification which does not<br>
result in major deviations from the actual scatter<br>
distribution.<br>
On the basis of this model assumption, the scatter correction<br>
can now be performed, the sequence of which is shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
After image capture 16, a projection image 17 is present<br>
which reproduces the primary radiation 10 and secondary<br><br>
radiation incident on the x-ray detector 8. The projection<br>
image 17 undergoes data reduction 18 in which different<br>
breast regions 13, 14 and 15 are each assigned specific<br>
tissue distributions. In addition, information relating to<br>
the geometrical relationships, in particular the edges of the<br>
breast 6, are obtained. With the aid of the information<br>
obtained in data reduction 18 concerning the physical<br>
constitution of the breast 6, a scatter beam spread function<br>
(SBSF) 20 assignable to the particular breast region 13, 14<br>
and 15 can be looked up in a breast SBSF atlas 19. Using the<br>
SBSFs 20 and an estimate for the primary radiation 10, a<br>
scatter correction 21 can then be performed. The correction<br>
values generated as part of scatter correction 21 can be<br>
directly applied to the projection images 17 if the scatter<br>
correction has been calculated for each of the detector<br>
pixels 9 of the x-ray detector 8. Because of the minimal<br>
scatter variation across the x-ray detector 8, it may be<br>
sufficient to perform the scatter correction for selected<br>
detector regions. These can be individual grid points or<br>
groups of detector pixels 9. The scatter correction for the<br>
detector pixels 9 for which no scatter correction has yet<br>
been determined can be determined by an interpolation 22<br>
which produces a correction image 23 having the same<br>
resolution as the projection image 17. By combination 24 of<br>
the projection image 17 and the correction image 23 there is<br>
finally produced a finished structure image 25 which<br>
preferably contains exclusively the structure of the breast 6<br>
imaged by the primary radiation 10.<br>
The requirements for the radiation correction described here<br>
and the associated processing steps will now be described in<br>
detail below:<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
It is firstly assumed that the sensitivity spectrum N(E)<br>
critical for imaging is known:<br>
the radiation of the x-ray tubes is polychromatic, the energy<br>
spectrum Qu(E) of the photons emitted as bremsstrahlung at the<br>
anode depends on the high voltage U applied with which the<br>
electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode; the<br>
maximum photon energy is then Emax(U) = U(keV/kV)=eU; however, it<br>
is not just the image spectrum that is critical for imaging,<br>
but also the transparency of spectral filters W(E) used and<br>
the spectral response sensitivity ΗD(E) of the detector 8. The<br>
resulting (normalized) spectral distribution is defined by:<br><br>
It is secondly assumed that - for a given resulting spectral<br>
distribution NU(E) and given breast layer thickness H which<br>
is defined by the spacing of the compression plates 5 - the<br>
attenuation of the detector signal (of primary x-radiation,<br>
without scatter) is present in pre-calculated form as a<br>
function of the proportion of glandular tissue or fatty<br><br>
tissue(if necessary validated by measurements), i.e. the<br>
following function is given in tabular form:<br><br>
it being assumed that the compressed breast 6 completely<br>
fills out the layer thickness H between the compression<br>
plates 5. As shown in Figure 4 this condition is no longer<br>
met in the region of a few cm near a breast tip 26 and<br>
outside in the region of unattenuated radiation. As will be<br>
explained in detail below, these image field regions must be<br>
dealt with separately as part of a pre-correction, e.g. by<br>
suitable extrapolation of the tissue layer thickness H to 0.<br><br>
For mathematical reasons the logarithmic attenuation signal<br>
is more useful than the non-logarithmic attenuation function<br>
F in equation (# 2):<br><br>
The function fH is monotonic and continuous and consequently<br>
invertible, e.g. by inverse interpolation. It can therefore<br>
be assumed that the inverse function<br><br>
is also available in tabular form.<br>
It is thirdly assumed that the so-called breast SBSF atlas 19<br>
is available, for the method described here is based on<br>
knowledge of the relevant SBSFs 20 (scatter beam spread<br>
functions). An SBSF 20 describes in each case the spatial<br>
intensity distribution of the scatter on the x-ray detector 8<br>
implemented as a flat-panel detector for a thin x-ray beam<br>
which penetrates the scatter object (breast) according to<br>
Figure 1 at a predefined location. The SBSF 20 depends on<br>
capture parameters and on object parameters.<br>
Capture parameters are, for example, the tube voltage which<br>
affects the photon emission spectrum which, moreover, is also<br>
dependent on the anode material, the pre-filtering, the air<br>
gap, the SID (source-image distance), the collimation, the<br>
spectral response sensitivity of the x-ray detector 8 and the<br>
presence or absence of an anti-scatter grid.<br><br>
An object parameter is on the one hand the layer thickness H<br>
of the breast 6 and, on the other, the different proportion<br>
of glandular or fatty tissue along the propagation direction<br>
of the x-radiation 3.<br>
It is assumed that the SBSFs 20 are available for the most<br>
important capture and object parameters arising, i.e. that<br>
there exists a set of tables created in advance, the so-<br>
called breast SBSF atlas 19, which can be used to determine<br>
with sufficient accuracy the associated SBSF 20 for the<br>
specific capture conditions for each proportion of fatty and<br>
glandular tissue (scatter material distribution) along an x-<br>
ray beam, e.g. by interpolation in the breast SBSF atlas 19<br>
or by semi-empirical conversions for parameters on which the<br>
SBSF is only weakly dependent or for which functional<br>
dependencies are known, such as in the case of the SID.<br>
The breast SBSF atlas 19 is created in advance by means of<br>
Monte Carlo simulation calculation. Monte Carlo simulation<br>
permits adequate modeling of the physical processes of<br>
absorption and multiple scattering (predominantly coherent<br>
scattering in the lower frequency range in mammography)<br>
during passage through the scatter object, in particular the<br>
breast 6, taking account of the capture conditions (anode<br>
material, filter, voltage, air gap, SID, field size, and<br>
possibly anti-scatter grid). This is the major advantage of<br>
the Monte Carlo methods over analytical simulation models<br>
which are generally limited to single scattering and in which<br>
in most cases various simplifications and approximation are<br>
also introduced in order to reduce the cost/complexity. The<br>
calculation of scatter distributions on the basis of a Monte<br>
Carlo simulation will be familiar to the average person<br><br>
skilled in the art and as such is not part of the subject<br>
matter of the application.<br>
Description of the individual steps:<br>
The scatter correction is subdivided into the following<br>
individual steps which can be repeated in an iterative cycle:<br>
0.	Empty image calibration and determination of the<br>
effective attenuation signal (even a simple general<br>
scatter pre-correction being recommended);<br>
1.	Determination of the proportion of glandular and fatty<br>
tissue;<br>
2.	Estimation of the scatter distribution (more accurate<br>
SBSF model);<br>
3.	Estimation of the primary radiation distribution<br>
(scatter correction);<br>
4.	Iterative repetition from step 1. or end.<br>
Steps 0. and 1. must be performed for each measuring beam,<br>
i.e. for each pixel (j,k), the term pixel being used in the<br>
following both for the detector pixels 9 and for detector<br>
regions comprising a plurality of detector pixels.<br>
Step 0: Io calibration and attenuation signal with pre-<br>
correction<br>
If Io(j,k) is the empty image which is identical to the<br>
measured intensity distribution in the beam path without<br>
scatter object, I(j,k) the measured intensity distribution<br>
with scatter object (breast), then the effective attenuation<br>
signal for total radiation, i.e. the superposition of primary<br>
and secondary (=scattered) radiation, is given by:<br><br><br>
In general it will be advisable in respect of step 1. to<br>
carry out even here a pre-correction of the scatter<br>
background which shall be denoted by S(0) . Methods for<br>
estimating S(0) are appended below. S(0) can be location-<br>
dependent, but is constant in the simplest case. The pre-<br>
correction already provides an estimate of the primary<br>
attenuation signal (normalized primary intensity)<br><br>
Step 1: Estimation of specific tissue proportions<br>
If P(j, k) is initially assumed to represent only primary<br>
radiation without scatter, with equation (#4) and (#3) this<br>
yields for the glandular tissue component:<br><br>
and for the glandular tissue weight per unit area [g/cm2] :<br><br>
and for the fatty tissue weight per unit area:<br><br>
As the abovementioned assumption does not strictly apply, an<br>
iterative procedure is required. This will be explained in<br>
greater detail in connection with remarks concerning step 4.<br><br>
Step 2: Optimally correct estimation of the scatter<br>
distribution over the entire projection image<br>
This step involves several sub-steps:<br>
2.1 Look-up in the breast SBSF atlas<br>
Generation of the SBSF atlas 19 will now be described in<br>
further detail.<br>
In step 1, a(j, k) was calculated for each beam to which a<br>
pixel (j,k) is assigned. For the calculated value of α(j,k)<br>
and H as well as further parameters such as air gap,<br>
spectrum and other parameters, the associated SBSF 20 is then<br>
generally determined from the breast SBSF atlas 19 by<br>
interpolation:<br>
SBSF((λx, λv); a; H; air gap, voltage, filter, detector,...)<br>
SBSF is a two-dimensional function or rather a two-<br>
dimensional field (data array) depending on the row and<br>
column coordinates on the x-ray detector 8. Each SBSF 20 is<br>
focused on a center, namely the particular beam or rather the<br>
relevant pixel with the coordinates (0,0) and reduces as a<br>
function of distance from the beam center. The distance from<br>
the center in both coordinate directions is characterized by<br>
an index pair (λX,λy) . The SBSF 20 is a kind of point or line<br>
image function, the beam corresponding to the point or line<br>
in reality.<br>
To characterize the interpolation we employ the notation:<br><br><br>
This applies to any pixels (j,k) and therefore the total<br>
scatter distribution is described by equation (#9).<br>
2.3 Low-pass filtering<br>
Because of the multiple scatter processes producing it in the<br>
body, the scatter distribution is relatively smooth and<br>
therefore exhibits a low-frequency Fourier spectrum. In order<br>
to eliminate high-frequency error components induced by the<br>
preceding steps, 2-dimensional smoothing is advisable.<br>
Step 3: Scatter correction<br>
Initially the available data is actually uncorrected, i.e.<br>
measurement-based data containing the superposition of<br>
primary radiation 10 (direct, unscattered radiation) and<br>
secondary radiation 11 (= scatter).<br>
After normalization according to equation (#5a) we have:<br><br><br>
P	initially unknown but wanted (normalized) primary-<br>
radiation 10<br>
S	unknown secondary radiation 11, but estimated<br>
(normalized) using the proposed model.<br>
Normalization should be understood as division by the<br>
intensity distribution  without scatter object.<br>
Equation (#9) directly yields a subtractive scatter<br>
correction:<br><br>
for estimating the primary radiation distribution.<br>
Another correction which is recommended in cases of a<br>
relatively large amount of secondary radiation 11 is<br>
multiplicative scatter correction:<br><br>
Note that the corrections in equation (#11) and equation<br>
(#12) are only approximate and do not provide identical<br>
results. For S/T«l, however, (#11) becomes (#12).<br>
Step 4: Iteration<br>
In equation (#11) and (#12) the scatter radiation term S,<br>
which for its part must be calculated by equation (#9),<br>
appears on the right-hand side ; however, equation (#9) is<br>
defined by means of the (unknown) primary radiation P which<br>
for its part appears on the left-hand side of equation (#11)<br>
and (#12) and is only to be calculated by one of these<br><br>
equations. P therefore appears both on the left- and right-<br>
hand side of equation (#11) and (#12). Such implicit<br>
equations must be solved iteratively. We write for S in<br>
equation S_(#9) :<br><br>
Iteration is performed for the subtractive method as follows:<br>
Start of iteration with pre-correction which will be<br>
described in greater detail below:<br><br>
For the multiplicative method, the iteration is performed as<br>
follows:<br>
Start of iteration with pre-correction which will be<br>
described in greater detail below:<br><br><br>
The sequence of iterations is aborted if the result between<br>
step n and n+1 only varies slightly. In many cases even one<br>
cycle suffices (n=l).<br>
SNR improvement by statistical estimation: ML and Bayesian<br>
methods<br>
Interestingly the multiplicative correction method (#15b)<br>
can be derived from a statistical estimation approach<br>
according to the maximum likelihood principle (ML). Although<br>
in the relevant technical literature a simple convolutional<br>
model is used for the scatter operator S_(P) in equation<br>
(#13a), for example, in A. H. BAYDUSH, C. E. FLOYD: Improved<br>
image quality in digital mammography with image processing.<br>
In: Med. Phys., Vol. 27, July 2000, pages 1503 to 1508, ML<br>
can basically be applied independently of the specific<br>
scatter model, particularly also in the case of the scatter<br>
model described here.<br>
The feature of a method based on the ML principle is that<br>
although the SNR (= signal-to-noise ratio) is usually<br>
improved after a few iterations, if the iterations are<br>
continued, the noise increases uncontrollably and the SNR<br>
deteriorates again. In order to counteract this runaway of<br>
the ML algorithm, Bayesian estimation methods are<br>
recommended, resulting in algorithms which differ from<br>
equation (#15b) in having a stabilizing additional term on<br>
the right-hand side. The effect of this additional term on<br>
convergence rate, SNR and the compromise between noise and<br>
local resolution can be controlled by parameters.<br>
Pre-corrections<br><br>
In the previous comments concerning steps 1 and 2.1,<br>
equations (#6) and (#7), it was assumed that the compressed<br>
breast 6 completely fills out the layer thickness H between<br>
the compression plates 5 and that the function fH-1 can be<br>
evaluated. As shown in Figure 4 this condition is no longer<br>
fulfilled in the region of a few cm near a breast tip 26 and<br>
outside in the region of unattenuated x-radiation 3. These<br>
image field regions must be dealt with separately as part of<br>
a pre-correction. In the region of unattenuated x-radiation 3<br>
outside the breast 6, the effective attenuation signal<br>
according to equation (#5a) must theoretically be = 1, but is<br>
generally &gt; 1 because of the presence of scatter. The<br>
difference<br><br>
in the image region outside the breast 6.<br>
From the normal image region of the fully compressed breast<br>
6 to the region near the breast tip 26 a suitable<br>
extrapolation of the tissue layer thickness from H to 0<br>
must be performed. In this image region, H must therefore<br>
generally be assumed to be variable in equations (#2), (#6)<br>
and (#7) .<br>
If necessary, segmentation into 3 image regions can also be<br>
performed as described in K. NYKANEN, S. SILTANEN: X-ray<br><br>
scattering in full field digital mammography. In Med. Phys. ,<br>
Vol. 30(7), July 2003, pages 1864 to 1873.<br>
In the normal image region with constant tissue layer<br>
thickness H a scatter pre-correction can look like this: as<br>
there has not yet been any evaluation of the tissue<br>
proportions (glandular/fatty tissue), initially 100 % fat<br>
can be assumed. Although because of the lower density of fat<br>
(0.92 compared to 0.97 g/cm3 for glandular tissue) the<br>
scatter is underestimated, for a Oth-order correction this<br>
estimation is significantly better than no correction at<br>
all. α=0 is inserted in equation (#7) and the subsequent<br>
equations, making the scatter kernel SBSF location-<br>
independent, in particular independent of the pixel index<br>
(j.k), and equation (#9) is reduced to a genuine<br>
convolution.<br><br><br>
Creating the breast SBSF atlas<br>
Of interest in the SBSF concept is the distribution of the<br>
scatter produced in the scatter body in the detector plane<br>
when, as shown in Figure 4, the (unscattered) primary<br>
radiation (i.e. a mini cone beam 27) is focused on a single<br>
detector pixel 9. If this is done consecutively for each<br>
detector pixel 9 and all the associated SBSFs 20 are summed,<br>
the total scatter distribution is obtained for the case where<br>
the entire detector surface is illuminated - and not only<br>
individual detector pixels 9.<br>
As already described above in connection with the third<br>
requirement and step 2, the breast SBSF atlas 19 of the<br>
scatter beam spread functions (SBSF) comprises the scatter<br>
intensity distributions normalized to the intensity of the<br>
primary radiation 10 in the detector pixel 9 (assuming that<br>
the mini cone beam 27 is focused on just one pixel 9) as a<br>
function of a plurality of different parameter<br>
configurations:<br>
SBSF(( λx,λy); a;H; air gap, voltage, filter, detector,... ) (#17)<br>
and also contains the dependency of the x-ray energy spectrum<br>
on the tube voltage, pre-filtering, radiation-sensitive<br>
detector material, e.g. the type of scintillation crystal,<br>
and the dependency on the presence or absence of an anti-<br>
scatter grid and where applicable the dependence on the type<br>
of anti-scatter grid as well as the dependence on other<br>
parameters.<br>
The creation of an SBSF series will now be explained:<br><br>
First the parameters characterizing the relevant mammography<br>
machine 1 are defined: SID, air gap, anode material of the x-<br>
ray tubes (and associated emission spectra), detector<br>
material, pre-filter material (e.g. compression plates), and<br>
other parameters. Then comes the compression thickness H,<br>
the voltage, the spectral filters used and other variables,<br>
the voltage and if necessary the spectral filter (thickness)<br>
generally being modified as a function of the compression<br>
thickness H in order to optimize image quality.<br>
For this parameter configuration, the parameter a describing<br>
the tissue composition according to equation (#2a) is varied<br>
between 0 (fat only) and 1 (glandular tissue only): the<br>
calculation using the tried and tested Monte Carlo method<br>
produces a set of different SBSFs 20, each α-value being<br>
assigned an SBSF 20.<br>
The tissue thickness H is varied between &gt; 0 and up to<br>
approximately 10 cm and another set of SBSFs 20 is again<br>
calculated for each H . The voltage and the spectral filters<br>
can also be varied, the variation being linked to H or also<br>
independent of H . However, in the latter case multiple<br>
variations are possible. In addition, the calculation can be<br>
continued for all the parameter combinations.<br>
For calculating the SBSFs 20, simplifications can be<br>
performed which are well justified:<br>
• Disregarding the beam divergence of the x-radiation 3 due<br>
to the cone beam geometry by assuming approximately<br>
parallel beam geometry; this is justified in that generally<br>
SID &gt;&gt; H ; this is achieved in that the SBSF 20 remains<br><br>
location- and pixel-independent for an identical beam<br>
configuration; by identical configuration is meant that,<br>
for each pixel, the material distribution is the same along<br>
the mini cone beam 27 and in the lateral neighborhood.<br>
•	To improve the statistics for the Monte Carlo method and<br>
reduce the computational complexity, pixels approximately<br>
an order of magnitude larger (e.g. 1 xl mm2 or 2 x 2 mm2)<br>
than the actual detector pixels 9 (
calculate the SBSFs 20; this is justified by the low-<br>
frequency Fourier spectrum of the spatial scatter<br>
distribution.<br>
•	The succession of fatty and glandular tissue is replaced by<br>
a mixture; although the scatter depends (for the same<br>
weight per unit area and path length) on whether the denser<br>
tissue is nearer the x-ray detector 8 or nearer the<br>
radiation source 2, according to J.M. DINTEN and J.M.<br>
Voile: Physical model based restoration of mammographies.<br>
In Proc. SPIE, Vol. 3336, 1998, 641-650, the differences<br>
occurring under mammographic conditions can be disregarded.<br>
Advantages<br>
The solution proposed here has the following advantages:<br>
If required, the method can be incorporated in existing<br>
mammography machines without mechanical reconstruction.<br>
Moreover it is a method which on the one hand shares the<br>
adequacy of physical modeling using the Monte Carlo method,<br>
but on the other hand - because all the time-consuming<br>
calculations are carried out in advance where possible and<br><br><br>
the necessary data is stored in tables - ultimately involves<br>
relatively low computational complexity for the scatter<br>
correction.<br>
The modeling accuracy of the scatter correction described here<br>
is essentially greater than that of the known (analytical)<br>
physical models, as a number of simplifying assumptions and<br>
approximations can be dispensed with.<br>
The possibilities of the scatter correction proposed here go<br>
far beyond the possibilities of the long known<br>
convolution/deconvolution methods. Disregarding the specific<br>
technical embodiment of the method and looking at it from a<br>
mathematical standpoint, the method can be regarded in the<br>
mathematical sense as a generalization of the long known<br>
convolution/deconvolution method. On the one hand, by using<br>
approximations and dispensing with accuracy, it can be<br>
categorized as method of this type and then shares its<br>
advantages, such as the possibility of using the so-called FFT<br>
(= Fast Fourier Transformation). On the other hand, however,<br>
the method described here can also be extended in terms of SNR<br>
improvement, e.g. by extending the iterative multiplicative<br>
algorithm in the direction of statistical Bayesian estimation.<br>
In this context it should be re-emphasized that only pre-<br>
calculation of the SBSFs 20 enables the method described here<br>
to be performed in full generality.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br><br>
In this example, scatter correction is performed, as described<br>
above with equations (#5)-(#9) and (#13)-(#15), using<br>
homogeneous location-dependent scatter beam spread functions<br>
20 (= SBSF). For creating said scatter beam spread functions<br>
20 it is assumed by way of simplification that the tissue<br>
distribution characterized by the proportion α(j, k) of<br>
glandular tissue along the beam leading from the source to<br>
the detector pixel continues in a constantly homogeneous<br>
manner according to Figure 4 at right angles to the beam,<br>
i.e. parallel to the compression plates 5. It is therefore<br>
assumed with respect to the scatter contribution of the beam<br>
in the pixel (j, k) that the tissue composition in the lateral<br>
neighborhood of the beam does not vary abruptly. Although<br>
this is no longer relevant at the edge of the breast, special<br>
treatment could be provided there.<br>
Note, however, that the actual location-dependent<br>
inhomogeneity of the tissue composition is allowed for by a<br>
specifically different amount of glandular tissue α(j',k') for<br>
each pixel (j', k') and a specific scatter contribution<br>
dependent thereon. The SBSFs 20 are therefore generally<br>
different for each pixel.<br>
Example 1a:<br>
In this example la the method is essentially performed as in<br>
example 1.<br>
However, the following simplifications are made:<br>
For each pre-specified layer thickness and the other<br>
parameters such as voltage and pre-filtering, a common SBSF<br>
20 is used for all the pixels. In this case the SBSF 20 is<br><br><br>
therefore selected on a location-independent basis. The<br>
selection can be made, for example, by suitable averaging<br>
over the tissue compositions present. ∆S in equation (#7)<br>
and (#9) then becomes independent of the pixel index (j,k);<br>
the double index (j,k) can - similarly as in equations (#16a)<br>
to (#16c) - be omitted.<br>
The important feature is that the integral in equation (#9)<br>
becomes a genuine convolution which can be efficiently<br>
executed by FFT (=Fast Fourier Transformation).<br>
Example 1b:<br>
In this example lb the method is likewise performed<br>
essentially as in example 1.<br>
In this case, however, a uniform convolution kernel (for all<br>
the layer thicknesses) is used for the scatter calculation.<br>
The fact that for a small layer thickness relatively less<br>
scatter is produced than for a large layer thickness must be<br>
taken into account by means of scaling factors which are a<br>
function of the layer thickness and other parameters such as<br>
voltage and filtering.<br>
Approximately the same computational complexity is necessary<br>
for example 1b as for example la. On the other hand, much<br>
less memory space is required for storing the breast SBSF<br>
atlas 19 in this example.<br>
Notes on examples la and lb:<br>
In general the simplified examples la and lb share the<br>
characteristic that the convolutional models for the scatter<br><br><br><br>
can be inverted using the Fourier transformation. This is<br>
known as deconvolution. The examples described here differ<br>
from the conventional deconvolution methods in using one or<br>
more scatter beam spread functions 20 obtained in advance by<br>
Monte Carlo simulation.<br>
With regard to performing deconvolution, reference is made to<br>
a publication by J.A. SEIBERT and J.M. BOONE: X-ray scatter<br>
removal by deconvolution. In Med.Phys., Vol. 15, 1988, pages<br>
567 to 575. Reference is also made to the more recent<br>
publication P. ABBOTT et al: Image deconvolution as an aid to<br>
mammographic artifact identification I: basic techniques. In:<br>
Proc.SPIE, Vol. 3661, 1999, pages 698 to 709 which deals with<br>
deconvolution using regularization techniques for noise<br>
suppression. Another deconvolution method with thickness-<br>
dependent convolution is described in D.G. TROTTER et al:<br>
Thickness-Dependent Scatter-Correction Algorithm for Digital<br>
Mammography. In: Proc. SPIE, Vol. 4682, 2002, pages 469 to<br>
478. In this method an iteration with relaxation is<br>
performed.<br>
Example 2<br>
In this example the method is essentially performed as in<br>
example 1, but employing scatter beam spread functions 20<br>
which have been calculated for an inhomogeneous medium.<br>
Figure 5, for example, illustrates the case where a breast<br>
region 28 has a different composition from that of a<br>
surrounding breast region 29.<br>
This enables it to be taken into account that the SBSF 20<br>
depends not only on the tissue composition along the mini<br><br>
cone beam 27 supposedly focused on the detector pixel 27 but<br>
also on the tissue composition in the lateral neighborhood<br>
into which photons are scattered and can be further scattered<br>
again in the direction of the pixel. However, the effective<br>
extent of the lateral neighborhood is not very large because<br>
of the average free path length 
mammography energy range between about 20 and 40 keV. It<br>
would therefore suffice to assume the tissue composition to<br>
be homogeneous in a lateral half space, but generally<br>
different from the mini cone beam 27. The allowance for<br>
inhomogeneous SBSFs 20 with differences between beam and<br>
neighborhood might be relevant particularly at the breast<br>
edge .<br>
This example therefore constitutes a generalization of the<br>
above-described examples 1, la and lb, as in this case the<br>
SBSFs 20 depend not only on a tissue parameter a, but also<br>
on a surrounding tissue parameter y to be newly introduced.<br>
In this case the breast SBSF atlas 19 would therefore have an<br>
additional dimension.<br>
For the sake of clarity, the following table compares the<br>
different characteristics of examples 1, la, lb and 2:<br><br><br>
The method described here can also be applied to so-called<br>
dual energy methods which will be known to the average person<br>
skilled in the art. With the so-called dual energy method,<br>
which is used primarily in mammography or in bone<br>
densitometry, images are recorded simultaneously using two<br>
different energy spectra. The recordings using different<br>
energy spectra are provided by two different voltages and if<br>
possible also different spectral filtering so that the<br>
spectral regions effectively corresponding to the two<br>
measurements overlap one another as little as possible. By<br>
means of a computational process which is essentially based<br>
on the solution of a generally nonlinear system of two<br>
equations assigned to the two spectra, finer tissue<br>
differentiation can be achieved compared to a recording using<br>
one energy spectrum. For computation to be successful, the<br>
scatter components must be eliminated as much as possible, as<br>
otherwise the artifacts induced by the scatter components are<br>
in some circumstances stronger than the actual tissue image.<br>
Because of the differences in scatter for the two spectra,<br>
effective scatter correction is therefore critically<br>
important for the quality of the dual energy method.<br>
The proposed scatter correction method can also be used in<br>
this context. The geometrical parameters are identical for<br>
the two recordings, but the spectrally dependent parameters<br>
are different.<br>
The correction must be carried out for each of the two<br>
recordings according to the described formula, the only<br>
difference being that different SBSFs 20 must be used<br>
according to the different spectra.<br><br><br>
