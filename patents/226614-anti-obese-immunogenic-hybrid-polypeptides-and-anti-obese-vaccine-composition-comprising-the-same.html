SJ BIOMED INC, of 604 Business Incubator Center, Hanyang Univ., Sa l(il)-dong, Sangnok-gu, Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do 426-791, Republic of Korea.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/087800	PCT7KR2005/000784<br>
ANTI-OBESE IMMUNOGENIC HYBRID POLYPEPTIDES AND ANTI-OBESE VACCINE COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an immunogenic <br>
5   hybrid polypeptide, which comprises an amino acid sequence of a mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apolipoprotein B-100 and in which a C-terminus of the mimetic peptide is fused to an N-terminus of a helper T cell epitope, and a vaccine composition for preventing or treating obesity comprising 10   the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, arteriosclerosis and coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) have been gradually increasing in Korea due to a shift to Western dietary<br>
15    habits, and are the leading cause of increased mortality. Serum lipids causing these diseases include cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids and phospholipids. They form lipoproteins with apolipoprotein and ere transported through the bloodstream. Among them, low<br>
20   density lipoproteins (LDL) function to transport mainly TG and cholesterol, and changes in LDL-cholesterol levels are indications of the prognosis of the diseases.<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
  LDL-cholesterol, which is a major factor of lipid metabolism-associated diseases of adult people, binds to LDL receptors on the plasma membrane of cells in each tissue and is stored and used in the tissue. Alternatively,<br>
5    LDL-cholesterol is. taken up by scavenger cells and hydrolyzed, and free cholesterol is transferred to HDL along with apo E lipoprotein to be recycled in the liver, or is converted to bile salt to be discharged. During this process,  the  apolipoprotein  performs  very  important<br>
10  functions to maintain structural homeostasis of lipoproteins, serves as a cofactor of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, and plays a critical role in binding to a specific receptor on the plasma membrane.<br>
Apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B-100) is a major protein<br>
15    component of LDL, and is also present in IDL and VLDL. Thus, when antibodies in the blood are induced to recognize apo B-100, LDL clearance by phagocytes will easily occur. In this regard, some recent studies have been focused on the  employment  of  vaccines  to  decrease  plasma LDL-<br>
20  cholesterol levels and reduce the incidence of arteriosclerosis. Antibodies induced by such anti-cholesterol vaccine therapy are 1gM types which are considered to bind to VLDL, IDL and LDL, and such a strategy suggests the possibility of developing vaccines<br>
25 for preventing and treating hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis  (Bailey,  et  al.,  Cholesterol vaccines.<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
Science 264, 1067-1068, 1994; Palinski W et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A. 92, 821-5, 1995; Wu R, de Faire U et al., Hypertension. 33, 53-9, 1999) . Also, apolipoprotein B-100 is a huge protein molecule, which consists of 4560 amino acid<br>
5  residues, contains signal peptide of 24 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of more than 500 kDa (Elovson J et al., Biochemistry, 24:1569-1578, 1985). Since apolipoprotein B-100 is secreted mainly by the liver and is an amphipathic molecule, it can interact with the lipid components of plasma<br>
10 lipoproteins and an aqueous environment (Segrest J. P et al., Adv. Protein Chem., 45:303-369, 1994). Apolipoprotein B-100 stabilizes the size and structure of LDL particles and plays a critical xole in controlling the homeostasis of plasma LDL-cholesterol through binding to its receptor (Brown<br>
15  MS et al., Science,   232:34-47, 1986).<br>
Korean Pat. Laid-open Publication No. 2002-0018971, which was filed by the present inventors, describes a mimetic peptide of an epitope of apo B-100 having an anti-obesity effect. However, this publication only discloses that the<br>
20 mimetic peptide of the B cell epitope has an anti-obesity effect.<br>
Prior to the present invention, there is no report of enhancing the immuriogenicity of an apolipoprotein by fusing a B cell epitope of the apolipoprotein and a T cell <br>
25 epitope, except for an attempt to enhance immune responses by employing a protein carrier or adjuvant.<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,446, when luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) is conjugated with a different protein to enhance the immunogenicity of LHRH, the majority of immune responses are directed to the<br>
5  carrier protein rather than to LHRH, leading to carrier-induced immune suppression. Thus, persistent effort is required for selecting additional materials and determining linkage patterns and linkage sites capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of B cell epitopes.<br>
10       Many attempts to fuse a hapten with a carrier protein were made to enhance the immunogenicity of the hapten, but failed to obtain uniform enhancing effects. In particular, the linear linkage of a B cell epitope and a T cell epitope, like the present invention, resulted in loss of <br>
15 immunogenicity according to the orientation of the epitopes, the type of each epitope, and the like (Francis, M. J. et al., Nature 330:168-170, 1987), and the presence of a linker brought about reduced antigenicity (Partidos, C. et al., Mol. Immunol. 29:651-658, 1992). That is, there is no<br>
20  consistent rule applicable to design peptide vaccines, and the efficacy of designed vaccines is also not predictable. For the same reasons, when a highly hydrophobic PB1« peptide, which is an apo-B mimetic peptide, is fused with a T cell epitope, an antigenic region can be internalized into the <br>
25 fusion protein, leading to a decrease in its ability to induce antibody responses.<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT7KR2005/000784<br><br>
     Based on this background, the present inventors made various attempts to enhance the immunogenicity of PB14, which is a mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apolipoprotein B-100 having an anti-obesity effect. As a<br>
5    result, a hybrid polypeptide, in which an N-terminus of a helper T cell epitope is fused to a C-terminus of the mimetic peptide, displayed an excellent immunoenhancing effect, indicating that it is effective for preventing or treating obesity. It was an unexpected result since hybrid<br>
10  polypeptides displays excellent anti-obesity activity without inducing immune responses that neutralize beneficial activities or effects of the B cell epitope of apolipoprotein B-100 or without causing harmful side effects.<br>
15   Disclosure of the Invention<br>
        In one aspect, the present invention provides an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide, which comprises an amino acid sequence of a mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apolipoprotein B-100 and in which a C-terminus of the<br>

5   Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide, which comprises an amino acid sequence of a mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apolipoprotein B-100 and in which a C-terminus of the<br>
10   mimetic peptide is fused to an N-terminus of a helper T cell epitope.<br>
In a strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of an apolipoprotein, the present invention intends to provide an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide in which a T cell epitope is<br>
15   fused to a mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of an apolipoprotein, especially apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100). When a T cell epitope was fused to a mimetic peptide of the B cell epitope of apo B-100, PB14 had improved ability to induce antibody responses and displayed vaccine<br>
20   efficacy for an extended period of time, and so h.ad an excellent anti-obesity effect.<br>
The term "mimetic peptide of an epitope", as used herein refers to a peptide that mimics a minimal part of the epitope, which is an epitope that is sufficiently<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
similar to a native epitope so that it can be recognized by an antibody specific to the native epitope, or that is able to increase an antibody to crosslink with a native epitope. A mimetic peptide is also called a mimotope. Such a mimetic <br>
5     peptide is advantageous because it is recognized as "non-self" in vivo and thus overcomes the problem of self-tolerance in immune responses. The mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apo B-100 is recognized by an antibody specifically binding to apo B-100. The antibody <br>
10    specifically binding to apo B-10O includes polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, which specifically recognize and bind to apo B-100, and fragments -thereof, for example, Fc,<br>
Fab and F(ab')2.<br>
The mimetic peptide of a B cell epitope of apo B-100<br>
15   according to the present invention includes an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Thus, in a preferred aspect, the present invention relates to an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide, which includes an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and in<br>
20    which a C-terminus of a peptide recognized by an antibody specifically binding to apo B-100 is fused to an N-terminus of a helper T cell epitope.<br>
The present inventors isolated mimetic peptides (SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3) that are recognizable by a monoclonal<br>
25   antibody against apo B-100, Mab B or Mab B23, from a phage displayed peptide library by biopamning with the library.<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
The mimetic peptide of the epitope of apo B-100, which includes an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1, 2 and 3, may be in a monomeric form that is composed of a single copy of the amino acid sequence having <br>
5    any one of the SEQ ID Nos., or, to further enhance the immunogenicity of the mimetic peptide, may be in a multimeric form in which two or more, preferably three to eight, and more preferably three to six copies of the amino acid sequence having any one of the SEQ ID Nos. are linked.<br>
10    Most preferred is a tetramer (SEQ ID No. 4) in which four copies are linked. When the mimetic peptide is in a multimeric form, amino acid sequences each of which constitutes a monomer may be covalently linked directly or via a linker. When the amino acid sequences are linked via<br>
15    a linker, the linker may consist of one to five amino acid residues, which are selected from, for example, glycine, alanine, valine,  leucine,  isoleucine,  proline,  serine, threonine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, lysine and arginine.  Preferred amino acids<br>
20   available in the linker may include valine, leucine, aspartic acid, glycine, alanine and proline. More preferably, taking the ease of gene manipulation into account, two amino acids selected from valine, leucine, aspartic acid, etc. may be linked and used as a linker. A<br>
25    preferred mimetic peptide is prepared by linking two or more copies of an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
Nos. 1, 2 and 3 via the linker.<br>
         The term "T cell epitope", as used herein, refers to an amino acid sequence that is able to bind to MHC Class II molecules with a suitable efficiency and stimulate T cells <br>
5      or bind to T cells in a complex with MHC Class II. In this case, the T cell epitope is recognized by a specific receptor present on T cells, and functions to provide a signal requiring the differentiation of B cells to antibody-producing cells and induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes <br>
10     (CTL) to destroy target cells. The T cell epitope is not-specifically limited as long as it stimulates T cells and strengthens immune responses, and a variety of proteins, peptides, etc. suitable for the purpose are available. With respect to the objects of the present invention, the T cell <br>
15     epitope is preferably a helper T cell epitope. Examples of the helper T cell epitope may include hepatitis B surface antigen helper T cell epitopes, Chlamydia trachomitis major outer membrane protein helper T cell epitopes, Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite helper T cell epitopes, <br>
20     Escherichia coli TraT helper T cell epitopes, Tetanus toxoid helper T cell epitopes, diphtheria toxoid helper T cell epitopes, Schistosoma mansoni triose phosphate isomerase helper T cell epitopes, measles virus F protein helper T cell epitopes, T cell epitope sequences derived <br>
25     from pertussis vaccines, BCG (Bacile Calmette-Guerin), polio vaccines, mumps vaccines, rubella vaccines, rabies<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
vaccines, purified protein derivatives of tuberculin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and fragments or combinations thereof. The T cell epitope may include an addition, deletion or substitution of a selected amino acid residue<br>
5     according to the specific purpose, and may be provided in a multimeric form in which two or more different T cell epitopes are linked. In an embodiment of the present invention, a surface antigen of hepatitis B virus is used. The genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 3.2 kb in length,<br>
10    possesses the information for four important proteins and contains four open reading frames, S gene (surface antigen protein), C gene (core protein), P gene (DNA polymerase) and X gene. The S gene is divided into an S region encoding HBsAg and a preS region.  The preS region is divided into<br>
15   preSl encoding 108 or 119 amino acids according to HBV strains and preS2 encoding 55 amino acids regardless of subtype. The HBV preS2 protein activates helper T cells during in vivo immune responses, thereby stimulating the formation of an antibody against HBV.<br>
20  The term "hybrid polypeptide", as used herein, generally indicates a peptide in which heterogenous peptides having different origins are linked, and in the present invention, refers to a peptide in which a B cell epitope and a T cell epitope are linked.  This hybrid<br>
25 polypeptide may be obtained by chemical synthesis or expression and purification through genetic recombination<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
after each partner is determined. Preferably, a hybrid gene, in which a gene sequence encoding a B cell epitope is linked to another gene sequence encoding a T cell epitope, is expressed in a cell expression system. In such a hybrid <br>
5     polypeptide, the B cell epitope and the T cell epitope may be linked directly or by means of a connector, such as a linker. When a linker is used, it should not negatively affect the induction of immune responses by the hybrid polypeptide.<br>
10        The term "polypeptide", as used herein, is a term including a full-length amino acid chain in which residues including two or more amino acids are conjugated by covalent   peptide  bonds,   and   includes  dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides and polypeptides. In particular,<br>
15   in the present invention, the polypeptide means a hybrid polypeptide in which two or more peptides, in which several to several tens of amino acids are covalently bonded, are linked with each other. The hybrid polypeptide of the present invention is a polypeptide in which two or more<br>
20   peptides, for example, a B cell epitope and a T cell epitope, are linked. Each peptide sequence comprising the polypeptide includes a sequence corresponding to the aforementioned epitope, and may further include a sequence adjacent to the epitope.  These peptides may be made of L-<br>
25    or D-amino acids, or may be in various combinations of amino acids in two different configurations.  The hybrid<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT7KR2005/000784<br><br>
polypeptide of the present invention may be entirely composed of an antigenic region including the aforementioned B cell epitope, T cell epitope and a certain sequence adjacent thereto, and may further include an<br>
5   additional sequence. However, this additional sequence preferably should not reduce the overall immunogenicity. Such an additional sequence is exemplified by a linker sequence.<br>
The term "immunogenicity", as used herein, refers to<br>
10   the ability to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses to defend the body against impurities. A material inducing such immune responses is called an immunogen. The present invention employs a polypeptide having both a B cell epitope and a T cell epitope, which are immunogenic<br>
15    materials.<br>
The present inventors linked a C-terminus of PB14/ which is a tetrameric apo B-100 mimetic peptide that is an anti-obesity functional peptide having a B cell epitope but deficient in a T cell epitope, to a portion (T fragment) of<br>
20   HBV preS2 having a T cell epitope, thereby generating a gene fragment for the expression of PB14T (FIG. 1) . A PB14 fragment was obtained using BamHI and Xhol, and a T fragment was obtained using Sail and Hindlll. The PB14T gene  fragment was inserted into a pQE30 vector and<br>
25   transformed into E. coli JM109. An emerged colony was analyzed by restriction mapping (FIG. 2) and DNA sequencing<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
(FIG. 3), and was found to be a correct clone in which the B cell epitope is linked to the T cell epitope. This clone was designated "pBl4T". The pQE30 vector used for the expression of PBI4T and PBle initiates protein expression<br>
5     from its internal start codon along with six histidine residues for the convenience of protein purification, followed by an enterokinase cleavage site. The thus expressed PB14T is 16.2 kDa, and PBls is 16.5 kDa. Protein expression was investigated by subjecting samples collected<br>
10    at given time points to SDS-PAGE analysis (FIGS. 4 and 5).<br>
 Thus, an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide of SEQ ID No. 9, in which a tetrameric apo B-100 mimetic peptide is linked to an HBV surface antigen preS2, may be provided in the practice of the present invention.<br>
15	The immunogenic hybrid polypeptide of the present<br>
invention may be produced by chemical synthesis or genetic recombination. Preferably, the present hybrid polypeptide may be produced by transforming a host cell with a recombinant  vector  and  isolating  and  purifying  a<br>
20    polypeptide expressed by the host cell.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides a recombinant vector comprising a gene encoding the immunogenic hybrid polypeptide, and a host cell transformed with the recombinant vector.<br>
25        In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of producing the immunogenic hybrid polypeptide by<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
culturing a host cell transformed with the recombinant vector.<br>
      A process  of producing  the  immunogenic hybrid polypeptide  of  the  present  invention  by  genetic <br>
5      recombination comprises the following four steps.<br>
The first step is to insert a gene encoding the hybrid polypeptide into a vector to construct a recombinant vector. A vector into which foreign DNA is introduced may be a plasmid, a virus, a cosmid,  or the like.   The<br>
10   recombinant vector includes a cloning vector and an expression vector. A cloning vector contains a replication origin, for example, a replication origin of a plasmid, pharge or cosmid, which is a "replicon" at which the replication of an exogenous DNA fragment attached thereto<br>
15   is initiated. An expression vector was developed for use in protein synthesis. A recombinant vector serves as a carrier for a foreign DNA fragment inserted thereto, which typically means a double-stranded DNA fragment. The term "foreign DNA", as used herein, refers to DNA derived from a<br>
20    heterogeneous species, or a substantially modified form of native DNA from a homogenous species. Also, the foreign DNA includes a non-modified DNA sequence that is not expressed in cells under normal conditions. In this case, a foreign gene is a specific target nucleic acid to be transcribed,<br>
25  which encodes a polypeptide. The recombinant vector contains  a  target  gene that • is  operably linked to<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR200S/000784<br><br>
transcription and translation expression regulatory sequences, which exert their functions in a selected host cell, in order to increase expression levels of the transfected gene in the host cell. The recombinant vector<br>
5     is a genetic construct that contains essential regulatory elements to which a gene insert is operably linked to be expressed in cells of an individual. Such a genetic construct is prepared using a standard recombinant DNA technique. The type of the recombinant vector is not<br>
10    specifically limited as long as the vector expresses a target gene in a variety of host cells including prokaryotes and eukaryotes and functions to produce a target protein. However, preferred is a vector which is capable of mass-producing a foreign protein in a form<br>
15   similar to a native form while possessing a strong promoter to achieve strong expression of the target protein. The recombinant vector preferably contains at least a promoter, a start codon, a gene encoding a target protein, a stop codon and a terminator. The recombinant vector may further<br>
20   suitably contain DNA coding a signal peptide, an enhancer sequence, 5'- and 3'-untranslational regions of a target gene, a selection marker region, a replication unit, or the like.<br>
The second step is to transform a host cell with the<br>
25  recombinant vector and culture the host cell. The recombinant vector is introduced into a host cell to<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT7KR2005/000784<br><br>
generate a transformant by a method described by Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1. 74, 1989, the method including a calcium phosphate or calcium <br>
5   chloride/rubidium chloride method, electroporation, electro injection, chemical treatments such as PEG treatment, and gene gun. A useful protein can be produced and isolated on large scale by culturing a transformant expressing the recombinant vector in a nutrient medium.<br>
10  Common media and culture conditions may be suitably selected according to host cells. Culture conditions, including temperature, pH of a medium and culture time, should be maintained suitable for cell growth and mass production of a protein of interest. Host cells capable of<br>
15   being transformed with the recombinant vector according to the present invention include both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Host cells having high introduction efficiency of DNA and having high expression levels of an introduced DNA may be typically used. Examples of host cells include<br>
20    known prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells such as Escherichia sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., Steptomyces sp., fungi and yeast, insect cells such as Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9), and animal cells such as CHO, COS 1, COS 7, BSC 1, BSC 40 and BMT 10. E.  coli may be preferably used.<br>
25   The third step is to induce the hybrid polypeptide to express and accumulate.  In the present invention, the<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
inducer IPTG was used for the induction of peptide expression, and induction time was adjusted to obtain maxmimal protein yield.<br>
      The final step is to isolate and purify the hybrid <br>
5     polypeptide. Typically, a recombinantly produced peptide can be recovered from a medium or a cell lysate. When the peptide is in a membrane-bound form, it may be liberated from the membrane using a suitable surfactant solution (e.g., Triton-X 100) or by enzymatic cleavage.  Cells used<br>
10    in the expression of the hybrid peptide may be destroyed by a variety of physical or chemical means, such as repeated freezing and thawing, sonication, mechanical disruption or a cell disrupting agent, and the hybrid peptide may be isolated  and  purified  by  commonly  used  biochemical<br>
15   isolation techniques (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989; Deuscher, M., Guide to Protein Purification Methods Enzymology, Vol. 182. Academic Press. Inc., San Diego, CA, 1990). Non-limiting examples of the biochemical<br>
20   isolation     techniques    include     electrophoresis, centrifugation, gel filtration, precipitation, dialysis, chromatography   (ion-exchange  chromatography,   affinity chromatography,  immunosorbent  affinity  chromatography, reverse phased HPLC, gel permeation HPLC), isoelectric<br>
25   focusing, and variations and combinations thereof.<br>
In detail, in the present invention, the PB14T gene<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
fragment was ligated with a pQE30 vector and transformed into E. coli. The pQE30 vector is useful for mass-producing proteins in E. coli because it contains a promoter element consisting of the phage T5 promoter and a lac operator<br>
5     system using IPTG as an inducer. The expression of PB14T was confirmed by Western blotting using two antibodies recognizing PB14T, a rabbit anti-PB14 polyclonal antibody and a mouse anti-preS2 monoclonal antibody, as primary antibodies, and expressed proteins were then purified. PB14<br>
10    and PBI4T were denatured with 8 M urea because they are insoluble, and were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin for histidine-tagged proteins.<br>
Rats were immunized with the expressed and purified polypeptide, and were assessed for an increase in body<br>
15    weight of rats, serum antibody titers and changes in serum lipid profiles. As a result, compared to a normal group or a group vaccinated with a non-fusion mimetic peptide, a group vaccinated with the hybrid polypeptide showed suppressed weight gain, high titers and extended retention<br>
20    of an antibody against the mimetic peptide, and decreased serum levels of TG and LDL-cholesterol.<br>
There is no consistent rule applicable to peptide vaccine design, and the efficacy of designed vaccines is also unpredictable.  For the same reasons, when a highly<br>
25   hydrophobic PB14 peptide is fused with a T cell epitope that is a heterogeneous peptide, an antigenic region can be <br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT7KR2005/000784<br><br>
internalized into the fusion protein, leading to a decrease in its ability to induce antibody responses. In this difficult situation to deduce the fusion results, the present inventors designed the hybrid polypeptide in which 5 a mimetic peptide of the apo B-100 epitope is linked to a T cell epitope, and demonstrated that the hybrid polypeptide has increased immunogenicity that results in increased anti-obesity effect.<br>
The immunogenicity of an artificially synthesized<br>
10   hybrid polypeptide and a vaccine comprising the same is achieved when a B cell epitope and a helper T cell epitope are present at the same time. Also, the efficacy of the vaccine may be determined according to the orientation of the B cell epitope and the helper T cell epitope. That is,<br>
15   the ability of the hybrid polypeptide to induce antibody responses may vary depending on the helper T cell epitope being located at an N-terminus or a C-terminus of the B cell epitope (Partidos, C, Stanley, C, and Steward, M, The effect of orientation of epitope on the immunogenicity of<br>
20   chimeric synthetic peptides representing measles virus protein sequences, Molecular Immunology, 29(5), 651-658, 1992).<br>
In order to investigate the effect of the orientation of the B cell epitope and the helper T cell epitope on the<br>
25  induction of immune responses, the present inventors prepared a TB14 gene fragment by linking an N-terminus of<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
PB14 to a T fragment (FIG. 12), unlike the preparation of the BI4T gene fragment involving linking a C-terminus of PBI4 to a T fragment. In detail, a pTBl4 vector was constructed according to a method described in Example 9,<br>
5    transformed into E. coli M15, and expressed therein. The expressed hybrid polypeptide PTBI4, which has a His tag, was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA His-bound resin.<br>
In order to compare PTB14 and PB14T for their ability<br>
10    to induce antibody responses and immunogenicity, SD rats were immunized with each of the polypeptides, and blood samples were collected. Compared to PB14, PTB14 had enhanced ability to induce antibody responses, and the retention period of the serum antibody against PTBI4 was<br>
15   prolonged. However, these improvements upon immunization with PTBI4 were remarkably found to be about 50-60% lower than with PB14T (FIG. 16) . The same results were found in the suppression of body weight gain of the rats (Table 2) . These results indicate that the PB14T polypeptide, prepared<br>
20    by linking a C-terminus of PBI4 to a T fragment, has much stronger immunogenicity and anti-obesity effects.<br>
Thus, in yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a vaccine for preventing or treating obesity, comprising an immunogenic hybrid polypeptide which includes<br>
25   an amino acid sequence of a mimetic peptide of the apo B-100 epitope and in which a C-terminus of the mimetic<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
peptide is fused to an N-terminus of a helper T cell epitope.<br>
    An iramunogen can be determined to be available as a vaccine having good efficacy by comparing the magnitude of 5 responses to the immunogen and the ratio of observed individuals. In the present invention, with respect to the present object to provide a vaccine for preventing and treating obesity, the effect of an antigen on the induction of immune responses was assessed by investigating (a) body<br>
10    weight gain, (b) serum antibody titers and (c) changes in serum lipid profiles, thereby determining a highly efficient form of the antigen.<br>
In detail, 100 ug of each of purified PB14 and PB14T peptides were intraperitoneally injected into 7-week-old SD<br>
15   white rats three times at 2-week intervals, and changes in<br>
body weight of the rats were observed and plotted ' on a<br>
graph (FIG. 15).  From the primary injection to boosting<br>
(secondary injection), rats of each group showed similar<br>
body weight ranging from 292 g to 297 g. However, from one<br>
20   week after the secondary injection, a difference in body weight of rats was observed between vaccinated groups and normal and mock groups. This indicates that the weak immune responses induced by the primary injection were enhanced after boosting by the secondary injection, and that the<br>
25    enhanced immune responses lead to the suppression of body weight gain of rats.  Compared to the normal and mock<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
groups, the vaccinated groups displayed a reduction in body weight increment. Also, the PB14T peptide had a stronger inhibitory effect on body weight increment than the PB14 peptide (Table 2). This difference in body weight increment <br>
5     was maintained even after the third injection. In addition, the chimeric antigen PBI4T, which was homogenous, was found to more effectively induce immune responses than the PBI4 peptide conjugated with a carrier protein, ovalbumin. In vaccinated SD white rats,  serum antibody titers were<br>
10   measured at 10, 12, 14 and 16 weeks of age by ELISA (FIG. 16) . The PBl4T-immunized group showed increased antibody titers relative to the PB14-immunized group. At 14 weeks of age, the PBI4T-immunized group displayed 1.5-fold higher absorbancy (O.D.: optical density) values than the PB14-<br>
15    immunized group. At 16 weeks of age, the PBl4-immunized group showed a reduction in antibody titer, whereas the PBl4T-immunized group maintained the increased antibody titers. With respect to serum lipids, the vaccinated groups displayed lower levels of TG and cholesterol than the<br>
20   normal and mock groups. In particular, LDL-cholesterol levels were reduced to 60% of normal levels (FIG. 17) .<br>
These results demonstrate that a fusion form of PB14 with a T cell epitope has higher immunogenicity than PB14 itself, which has a B cell epitope, and thus can be used in<br>
25    an effective vaccine composition.<br>
In addition, the present  inventors conducted a<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
clinical test with pet dog subjects for the efficacy of ■PBI4T. PBI4T was mixed with alumina and injected into ten pet dogs twice at 2-week intervals, and changes in body weight were observed. As a result, no increment in body<br>
5     weight was found in the pet dogs even when the dogs were allow to freely eat snacks and high-fat diets (Table 4). Also, when serum samples were collected from the immunized pet dogs after the secondary injection and serum antibody titers were measured by ELISA, high absorbance was found<br>
10   even when the serum samples were diluted 5,000-50,000 times, indicating that the PBI4T peptide has an excellent effect on the induction of antibody responses.<br>
The anti-obesity vaccine of the present invention is composed of an antigen,  a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
15   carrier, a suitable adjuvant and other common materials, and is administered in an immunologically effective amount. The term "immunologically effective amount", as used herein, refers to an amount that is sufficient to exert the therapeutic and preventive effect on obesity and does not<br>
20   cause side effects or severe or excess immune responses. An accurate dosage may vary according to the specific immunogen to be administered, and may be determined by those skilled in the art using a known method for assaying the development of an immune response. Also, the dosage may<br>
25   vary depending on administration forms and routes, the recipient's age, health state and weight, properties and<br><br>

PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
degree of symptoms, types of currently received therapy, and treatment frequency. The carriers are known in the art and include a stabilizer, a diluent and a buffer. Suitable stabilizers include carbohydrates, such as sorbitol, <br>
5    lactose, mannitol, starch, sucrose, dextran and glucose, and proteins, such as albumin or casein. Suitable diluents include . saline, Hanks' Balanced Salts and Ringer's solution. Suitable buffers include an alkali metal phosphate, an alkali metal carbonate and an alkali earth<br>
10    metal carbonate. The vaccine may also contain one or more adjuvants to enhance or strengthen immune responses. Suitable adjuvants include peptides; aluminum hydroxide; aluminum phosphate; aluminum oxide; and a composition that consists of a mineral oil, such as Marcol 52, or a<br>
15   vegetable oil and one or more emulsifying agents, or surface active substances such as lysolecithin, polycations and polyanions. The vaccine composition of the present invention may be administered as an individual therapeutic agent or in combination with another therapeutic agent, and<br>
20 may be co-administered either sequentially or simultaneously with a conventional therapeutic agent. The vaccine composition may be administered via known administration routes. Administration methods include, but are  not limited to,  oral,  intradermal,  intramuscular,<br>
25   intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intranasal routes.  Also,  a  pharmaceutical  composition  may  be<br><br>

10    digestion was carried out again to obtain a B14T fragment. For protein expression, a pQE30 plasmid was selected as a vector system, which is designed to express a protein of interest in a form fused with six histidine residues to facilitate protein purification. The B14T gene fragment was<br>

EXAMPLE 6: Evaluation of expression form of PB14T and PBle recombinant peptides in E.  coll<br>
     In order to determine whether PB14T and PBls were<br>
5     expressed as soluble or insoluble proteins, the cells were harvested three hours after IPTG induction by centrifugation. The harvested cells were resuspended in sonication buffer and sonicated. The resulting pellet and supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In detail, the cells<br>
10   treated with IPTG to induce protein expression were centrifuged at 9,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The pelleted cells was frozen at -20°C for a while, thawed on ice, and resuspended in sonication disruption buffer (5 ml per 1 g pellet). The cells were sonicated fifteen times for 30 sec<br>
15  (each time with 1 min pause) . The cell lysate was then centrifuged at -9,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was recovered, thus yielding a crude extract A containing unprocessed soluble proteins. Also, the pellet was recovered,  thus  giving a  crude extract  B containing<br>
20   unprocessed insoluble proteins. The crude extracts A and B were individually mixed with 2x SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95°C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel. The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the target proteins were present mainly in the pellet  rather than the<br><br><br>

EXAMPLB 7: Purification of PB14, PB14T and PB18 recombinant peptides<br>
5.  Peptide purification was carried out using Ni-NTA resin for histidine-tagged proteins. This purification is an affinity chromatographic method using the interaction between Ni+ bound to the resin and the histidine hexamer at a terminal end of a fusion protein.  After transformed E.<br>
10  coli cells were pre~cultured in 10 ml of LB medium overnight, the 10-ml culture was inoculated in 500 ml of LB medium and cultured at 37°C until OD at 600 nm reached 0.4 to 0.5. Then, 1 mM IPTG was added to the medium, and the cells were further cultured for 4 hrs.  The cells were<br>
15   centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 30 min, and the cell pellet was placed at -20°C. After the frozen cells were thawed on ice, they were resuspended in sonication disruption buffer (5 ml/g of wet cells) and sonicated. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 9000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min.  The pellet was<br>
20   resuspended in a volume of binding buffer equal to that of the supernatant, sonicated three times to remove cell debris, and centrifuged at 9000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The thus obtained supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin.<br><br>

A column was 1 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height and was packed with 2 ml of a resin, and all of the steps were carried out at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After the resin was packed into the column, the resin was washed with a three<br>
5    to five column volume of distilled water, and the resin was charged with Ni2+ using a five column volumn of lx charge buffer (50 mM NiS04) and equilibrated with the binding buffer, thereby generating a Ni-chelate affinity column. After a sample was loaded onto the column twice, the column<br>
10   was washed with the binding buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm reached a baseline of 1.0 and then with washing buffer for 10 min. After the column was completely equilibrated, the column was eluted with elution buffer containing a higher concentration of imidazole than the<br>
15   washing buffer, thereby forming an imidazole gradient, and the elution was run alone through the column for a futher 10 min to.completely elute proteins bound to the resin. A total of twenty 2-ml fractions were collected. Since the eluted peptide was dissolved in 8 M urea, it was dialyzed<br>
20    in PBS overnight to remove urea.<br>
As described above, since each protein was highly insoluble, it was purified after being- denatured with a buffer containing 8 M urea, and proteins bound to the resin were eluted using an imidazole gradient of 50 mM to 400 mM.<br>
25   The results are given in FIGS. 9, 10 and 11. Most proteins were eluted at about 300 mM of imidazole.  Protein yields <br>

per 1 L culture were 3-3.5 mg for PB1B and 4-4.5 mg for ,PB1«T._<br>
EXAMPLE 8: Quantification of PB14, PB14T and PBla recombinant peptides<br>
5  When the eluted PB14T, PB14 and PBls peptides were dialyzed in PBS, proteins were aggregated because urea was removed, thus forming precipitates. In this state, accurate protein concentrations could not be measured. The aggregation of the purified proteins was solved using 50 mM<br>
10.  CHAPS. Protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay and a Bradford assay. 2 mg/ml of BSA was serially diluted to 1000, 500, 250, 125 and 62.5 ug/ml, and the serial BSA dilutions were used as standard. The BCA assay was performed according to the protocol provided by<br>
15  Pierce. The BCA protein color reaction was carried out at 37°C for 30 min, and absorbance was then measured at 562 nm. Also, a sample was allowed to react with a Bradford reagent at room temperature for 10 min, and absorbance was then measured at 595 nm. Standard curves were obtained using the<br>
20   absorbance of serial dilutions of BSA or Bradford protein color reactions, and protein concentrations of samples were determined using the standard curves.<br>

The pQE30 vector, transformed into E. coli M15, was double-digested with Kpnl (Takara) and Sail (Takara) to excise a T cassette (preS2) . A pBluescript plasmid was also treated with the same restriction enzymes. The excised T <br>
5     cassette and linearlized pBluescript were separated on a gel, purified, and ligated with each other using T4 DNA ligase. 4 ul of pBluescript, 4 fil of T cassette, 1 ul of T4 DNA ligase (MBI Fermentas, 1 Weiss u/ml) and 1 |jl of lOx buffer (MBI Fermentas) were mixed in a 1.5-ml tube, and the<br>
10   ligation mixture was incubated at 16°C overnight. The recombined vector was then mixed with JM109 competent cells, heat-shocked at 42°C for 90 sec, and incubated in LB medium at 37°C for 1 hr. Then, the transformed cells were smeared onto LB/Amp plates and incubated at 37°C.  Several<br>
15   colonies were randomly selected from the emerged coloni es and cultured. Plasmid DNA was then isolated from the cultured cells, digested with restriction enzymes, and electrophoresed on an agarose gel to analyze the size of DNA fragments. An Xhol site in the T cassette was removed<br>
20   to obtain a TB4 cassette. That is, since the T cassette (HBV preS2 gene, 183 bp) could not be used in cloning due to the Xhol site near its 3'-end (about 150 bp apart from the 5'-end of the T cassette), the T cassette was point-mutated at the internal Xhol site and thus had a new<br>
25   sequence.  A short DNA fragment (30 bp) was excised from <br>

PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
pBluescript-preS2 due to the internal Xhol site of the T cassette. Synthetic oligomers were inserted into this position. To prevent self-ligation, the vector was treated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH,<br>
5     Germany) at 37°C for 30 min, dephosphorylated at 95°C for 5 min, and eluted from a gel. The oligomers were phosphorylated at their 5'-ends by treatment with polynucleotide kinase at 37°C for 30 min and 65°C for 20 min.  Then, the vector and the oligomers were allowed to<br>
10   stand at 95°C for 5 min, and were slowly cooled in a heat block to be annealed. The oligomers and pBluescript-T were then treated with ligase at 16°C overnight. The recombined pBluescript-T was transformed into JM109 cells and smeared onto LB/Amp plates.  After plasmid DNA was Isolated from<br>
15   emerged colonies and analyzed, a clone carrying a desired plasmid was obtained. The oligomers consisted of 28 nucleotides corresponding to preS2, in which the fifth nucleotide, G, at the 5'-end of a sense-strand, was replaced with A to remove Xhol site, thereby having a lysine<br>
20   substitution for arginine. Sense and anti-sense strands, each of which was designed to be 28 mer, were annealed and inserted into the Xhol-treated pBluescript-preS2. After the pBluescript-T was double-digested with Sail and Xhol and pQE30-B4 was digested with Sail, they were purified from<br>
25   gels. The. obtained T was inserted into the pQE30-B4 cleaved at its 5'-end, thereby generating pQE30-pTB4. The recombined<br><br>

TB4 was confirmed by restriction mapping with Sail and Hindlll. The thus obtained vector was designated pTBl4 (FIG. 13) .<br>
EXAMPLE 10: Expression and purification of PTB14<br>
5   The expression vector pTBl4 was introduced into E. coli M15, and the transformed cells were cultured in 2 L of LB medium containing Amp and Kan. The cultured cells were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min, thus yielding 9 g of wet cells.   Since the recombinantly expressed  hybrid<br>
10   polypeptide PTB4 had a His-tag, it was subjected to affinity chromatography using an Ni-NTA His-bound resin. A column used was 4 ml in resin volume, 1.8 cm in diameter a.nd 8 cm in height. The absorbance range of an Econo system was 0.5, the paper speed of a recorder was 2 cm/hr, and the sample<br>
15   loading rate was 2 ml/min. First, the wet cells were suspended in sonication buffer, sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in binding buffer and subjected to affinity chromatography. A binding solution flowed through the column to settle a<br>
20    resin. When a baseline was decided using a detector and a predetermined value was indicated, the sonicated sample was loaded onto the column. When the sample entered into the column and a predetermined value was indicated, a washing solution was run through the column.  When a predetermined<br><br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
value was indicated, an elution solution was run through the column, thereby isolating PTB14. The expressed and purified hybrid polypeptide was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The PTBI4 separated on an SDS-PAGE gel<br>
5     was transferred onto a membrane by semi-dry transfer. The blot was incubated in blocking buffer (0.5% casein-phosphate buffered saline-Tween, 0.02% NaN3) at 37°C for 2 hrs, and washed with Tris-buffeared saline-Tween (TBS-T, pH 7.6) twice for 2 min each washing.  Then, the blot was<br>
10   incubated in a primary antibody at 37°C for 1 hr and washed with TBS-T four times for 5 min each time. The blot was incubated in a secondary antibody for 1 hr and washed according to the same method, ro identify the T cassette, an anti-preS2 monoclonal antibody (1:10,000) and an HRP-<br>
15    conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG- antibody (1:10,000) were used. A B cassette was detected using a rabbit anti-PBl4 anti-serum (1:10,000) and an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000). After being dried, the blot was treated with ECL reagents fozr 5 min to detect bands. As<br>
20    a result, in the B cassette, which was detected using the rabbit anti-PBl4 anti-serum and the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, an about 16-kDa band was found in PBI4T and PTBI4 samples. In -the T cassette, which was detected using the anti-preS2 monoclonal antibody and the<br>
25   HRP-conj ugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, a band of about 8 kDa was found in the PBI4 sample, and a band of <br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
about 16 kDa band was found in PBI4T and PTBI4 samples. These results indicate that each hybrid polypeptide was accurately expressed and purified (FIG. 13).<br>
EXAMPLE 11: Conjugation of PB14 and ovalbumin<br>
5    PBI4 was conjugated with a carrier protein, ovalbumin. The carrier protein and PB14 were mixed at a molar ratio of about 1:10, and allowed to react with agitation at 4°C for about 1 hr in a reaction vial. After the reaction mixture was supplemented with 2% 10 glutaraldehyde, it was allowed to react for 3 hrs. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed using a dialysis membrane, MWCO 3,000, in PBS buffer overnight to remove remaining glutaraldehyde.<br>
EXAMPLE 12: Vaccination (Immunization)<br>
15   7-week-old SD white rats were divided into six groups and vaccinated (Table 1) . As described in Table 1, 100 p.g of each peptide, purified and quantified in Examples 7 and 10, was mixed with each adjuvant to give a final volume of 100 ul,  and intraperitoneally injected into the rats.<br>
20    Injection was carried out three times at 2-week intervals, that is, at 7, 9 and 11 weeks of age. Freund's adjuvant and aluminum hydroxide were as adjuvants. The Freund's adjuvant<br><br>
WO 2005/087800<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000784<br><br>
was used in the same amount as the peptide. Aluminum hydroxide of 5.8 mg/ml was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, mixed with each peptide, and incubated with agitation at room temperature. Blood samples<br>
5   were collected five days after the first boosting and five days, two weeks and four weeks after the second boosting.<br>

PCT7KR2005/000784<br><br>
washed with PBST three times. Serum samples collected from vaccinated SD rats were 1:500 to 1:8000 diluted in PBS. 100 jil of each diluted serum sample was added to each well, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Each well was washed with PBST <br>
5         three times and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rat IgG as a secondary antibody. The plate was subjected to color development with OPD, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.<br>
        FIG. 16 shows the antibody titers of SD rats of <br>
10       vaccinated groups at 10, 12, 14 and 16 weeks of age. Titers were determined by ELISA based on the absorbance value of 0.6 when each serum sample was 1:2000 diluted. When the serum sample was diluted at 1:500 to 1:8000, the groups injected with PB14, PB14T and PTB14 showed increased <br>
15     antibody titers until 14 weeks of age. The PBl4T-immunized group displayed 1.5-fold higher O.D. values than the PB14-immunized group, and the PTBl4-immunized group showed a slight increase compared to the PB14 group. At 16 weeks of age, the PB14 group showed a reduction in antibody titer, <br>
20       and the PB14T and PTB14 groups maintained the increase of antibody titers. However, PTB14 was found to have a remarkably weak effect in increasing antibody titers by about 50-60% compared to PB14T.<br>

PBI4T was mixed with alumina as an adjuvant. 0.5 ml of the mixture (2 mg/ml) was intramuscularly or subcutaneously injected into ten pet dogs (managed with an obesity treatment in an animal hospital in Ansan, Korea)<br>
15  twice at 2-week intervals. Changes in body weight of the dogs were observed for a period of 1.5 to 3 months. As a result, an antibody was slowly reduced (half-life: three months), and no increase in body weight was found in the pet dogs even when the dogs were allow to freely eat snacks<br>
