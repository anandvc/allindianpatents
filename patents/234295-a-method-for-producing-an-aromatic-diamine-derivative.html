Description<br>
Method for Producing Aromatic Diamine Derivative<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for producing an aromatic diamine derivative; and more particularly to a method for producing an aromatic diamine derivative which is applied as a charge transport material of an electrophotographic photoconductor or as an organic electroluminescent device material.<br>
Background Art<br>
Aromatic diamine compounds have been applied as a charge transport material of an electrophotographic photoconductor or as an organic electroluminescent (EL)<br>
device material.  Particularly in the case where an aromatic<br>
i<br>
diamine compound is applied as an organic EL device material, when the device material does not have a high glass transition temperature, the resultant organic EL device fails to exhibit heat resistance. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an aromatic diamine derivative. containing in the molecule thereof a large number of aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings or heterocyclic rings).<br>
However, in general, an aromatic diamine derivative containing in the molecule thereof a large number of aromatic rings exhibits very poor solubility in a solvent. Such low<br><br>
solubility raises problems, including precipitation of diamine molecules in a solvent during the course of reaction, and limited reaction yield. For example, the following reaction:<br><br>
is difficult to progress, because of the presence of a large number of intramolecular aromatic rings, which cause the raw materials and reaction intermediates to exhibit low solubility.<br>
An aromatic diamine derivative is known to be produced through a reaction pathway applying a raw material such as<br>
a-naphthylamine, p-naphthylamine, 4-aminodiphenyl, or benzidine, which compounds are known to exhibit mutagenicity. Production of these compounds, which are designated "specified chemical substances," is prohibited in Japan, and therefore demand has arisen for a production method which does not apply such a compound as a raw material or an intermediate.<br><br>
For example, International Application PCT/JP02/02132 describes, as an example of such a production method, a method for producing an aromatic amine by reacting an aromatic amine having an arylalkyl group (e.g., a benzyl group) with an aromatic halide, without using a raw material or intermediate which may exhibit mutagenicity as described above.<br>
However, difficulty is encountered in determining conditions for the aforementioned reaction, since the reaction requires a reduction reaction (e.g., hydrogenation) upon elimination of an arylalkyl group, which often causes reduction of an aromatic ring (i.e., a side reaction).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to solve the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an aromatic,diamine derivative which is useful as a charge transport material of an electrophotographic photoconductor or as an organic EL device material, and which can be produced at high yield in an efficient manner.<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies, and as a result have found that when an aromatic amide having a specific structure is reacted with an aromatic halide having a specific structure, an aromatic diamine derivative can be produced at high yield in an efficient manner. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for producing an aromatic diamine derivative represented by the following formula (3), which method comprises reacting an aromatic amide represented, by the following formula (1) with an aromatic halide represented by the following formula (2):<br><br>

atoms; each of Ar1 and Ar2 represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 30 ring carbon atoms, or<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl group having 5 to<br>
30 ring carbon atoms; Ar3 represents a substituted or unsubstituted arylene group having 6 to 30 ring carbon atoms,<br>

Subsequently, a stirrer piece was placed in the flask, a rubber cap (septum) was provided on each of the side necks of the flask, and a spiral reflux condenser was provided on the center neck. A three-way stop-cock and a balloon containing argon gas were provided on the reflux condenser.  The atmosphere in the reaction system was replaced by the argon gas contained in the balloon by use of a vacuum pump (this procedure was performed three times).<br>
Subsequently, diethylbenzene (50 mL) was added through the rubber septum by use of a syringe, the flask was placed in an oil bath, and the resultant mixture was gradually<br>
heated to 200°C under stirring.  Six hours later, the flask was removed from the oil bath, whereby the reaction was completed.  Thereafter, the flask was allowed to stand in an<br><br>
argon atmosphere for 12 hours.<br>
The resultant reaction mixture was transferred'to a<br>
separatory funnel, and dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to<br>
the mixture, to thereby dissolve the precipitate in the<br>
mixture. After the mixture was washed with saturated brine<br>
(60 mL), the resultant organic layer was dried over anhydrous<br>
potassium carbonate. The potassium carbonate was separated<br>

mixture.  Thereafter, the mixture was allowed to stand for 12<br>
hours, and was gradually cooled to room temperature for<br>
recrystaliization.<br>
The thus-precipitated crystals were separated through<br>

Subsequently, xylene (20 mL) was added through the rubber septum by use of a syringe, the flask was placed in an oil bath, and the resultant mixture was gradually heated to<br>
140°C under stirring. After the mixture was stirred at 140°C for six hours, the flask was removed from the oil bath, and<br>
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 12 hours.<br>
The thus-precipitated product was completely dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), and the resultant solution was transferred to a separatory funnel. After the solution was washed with saturated brine (50 mL), the thus-separated organic layer was dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration of the organic layer, the solvent was removed through evaporation, and toluene (150 mL) and ethanol (50 mL) were added to the resultant residue.  The resultant<br>
mixture was heated to 80°C, with a drying tube being used, to thereby dissolve the precipitate in the mixture, followed by<br>
gradual cooling to room temperature.  Subsequently, the<br>
resultant precipitate was separated through filtration, and<br>
washed with a small amount of toluene and ethanol.<br>
Thereafter, the precipitate was dried by use of a vacuum<br>
dryer at 60°C for three hours, to thereby yield 0.72 g of N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-biphenylyl)benzidine.<br>
The thus-obtained N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-iphenylyl)benzidine was subjected to measurement in terms of NMR (nuclear<br><br>
magnetic resonance spectrometry), FD-MS (field desorption mass spectrometry), and HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography).  The measurement results are as follows.<br>
NMR: 8 90 MHz 7.1-7.8 (44H, m)<br>

(1) Synthesis of N,N-di-(4-biphenylyl)-benzylamine<br>
4-Bromobiphenyl (product of Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) (10.0 g), sodium t-butoxide (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (4.32 g), and palladium acetate<br>
(product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (42 mg) were placed in a 100-mL three-neck flask.  Subsequently, a stirrer piece was placed in the flask, a rubber cap (septum) was provided on each of the side necks of the flask, and a spiral reflux condenser was provided on the center neck. A three-way stop-cock and a balloon containing argon gas were provided on the reflux condenser.

The resultant reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and dichloromethane (300 mL) was added to the mixture, to thereby dissolve the precipitate in the mixture. After the mixture was washed with saturated brine (60 mL), the resultant organic layer was dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate.

The atmosphere in the flask was replaced by the hydrogen gas by use of a vacuum pump (this procedure was performed 10 times). The balloon was filled with fresh hydrogen gas so as to compensate for the above-consumed hydrogen gas. After the hydrogen gas volume was returned to 2 L, the solution contained in the flask was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 30 hours. Thereafter, dichloromethane (100 mL) was added to the solution, and the catalyst was separated through filtration.<br>
Subsequently, the resultant solution was transferred to a separatory funnel, and the solution was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate (50 mL).  Thereafter, the resultant organic layer was separated, and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration of the organic layer, the solvent was removed through evaporation, and toluene (50 mL) was added to the<br><br>
resultant residue for recrystallization. The thus-precipitated crystals were separated through filtration, and<br>
then dried under vacuum at 50°C, to thereby yield 0-99 g of di-4-biphenylylamine.<br>

4-Bromobiphenyl (product of Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) (10.0 g), sodium t-butoxide (product of Wakp Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (4.32 g) , and palladium acetate<br><br>
(product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (42 mg) were placed in a 100-mL three-neck flask.  Subsequently, a stirrer piece was placed in the flask, a rubber cap (septum) was provided on each of the side necks of the flask, and a spiral reflux condenser was provided on the center neck. A three-way stop-cock and a balloon containing argon gas were provided on the reflux condenser. The atmosphere in the reaction system was replaced by the argon gas contained in the balloon by use of a vacuum pump (this procedure was performed three times).<br>
Subsequently, dehydrated toluene (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (60 mL), acetamide (product of Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) (1.24 g), and tris-t-butylphosphine (product of Aldrich, 2.22 mol/L toluene<br>
solution) (169 |iL) were added through the rubber septum by use of a syringe, and the resultant mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature for five minutes.<br>
Subsequently, the flask was placed in an oil bath, and<br>
the resultant mixture was gradually heated to 120°C under stirring.  Seven hours later, the flask was removed from the oil bath, whereby the reaction was completed. Thereafter, the flask was allowed to stand in an argon atmosphere for 12<br>
hours.<br>
The resultant reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and dichloromethane (300 mL) was added to the mixture, to thereby dissolve the precipitate in the mixture. After the mixture was washed with saturated brine<br><br>
(60 mL),. the resultant organic layer was dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The potassium carbonate was separated through filtration, and the solvent of the resultant organic layer was removed through evaporation.  Toluene (200 mL) and ethanol (40 mL) were added to the resultant residue, and the<br>
resultant mixture was heated to 80°C, with a drying tube being used, to thereby completely dissolve the residue in the mixture. Thereafter, the mixture was allowed to stand for 12 hours, and was gradually cooled to room temperature for recrystallization.<br>
The thus-precipitated crystals were separated through<br>
filtration, and then dried under vacuum at 60°C, to thereby<br>
yield 0.91 g of N,N-di-(4-biphenylyl)acetamide.<br>
(2) Synthesis of N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-biphenylyl)benzidine<br>
The procedure of Example 1 (2) was repeated, except that the N,N-di-(4-biphenylyl)benzamide (1.00 g) was replaced by the N,N-di-(4-biphenylyl)acetamide obtained above in (1) (0.85 g), to thereby yield 0.38 g of N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-biphenylyl)benzidine.<br>
The thus-obtained N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-biphenylyl) benzidine was subjected to measurement in terms of NMR, FD-MS, and HPLC. The measurement results are as follows.<br>
NMR: 8 90 MHz 7.1-7.8 (44H, m)<br>
FD-MS: 792, 396<br>
HPLC: chemical purity of 99.3% or more<br>
The overall reaction yield"was found to be 5%.<br><br>
