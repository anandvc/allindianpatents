CYCLOOCT-(EN-)YL DERIVATIVES FOR USE AS FRAGRANCES<br>
This invention relates to substituted cyclooctenes having agrestic, natural, and floral, green, woody odour notes, their manufacture, and to fragrance compositions containing<br>
them.<br>
Substituted cyclooctenes have been described in the literature, for example, the German patent publication DE 19814913 A1 discloses cyclooctene aldehydes, such as cyclooct-4-en aldehyde (1) possessing an odour note described to be comparable with the odour of fresh harvested potatoes.<br><br>
Whereas the odour notes imparted by cyclooct-4-en aldehyde (1) may be interesting in their own right, in the fragrance industry, there is always an ongoing demand for new compounds that enhance or improve on odour notes, or impart new odour notes.<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found certain monosubstituted cyclooctenes structurally similar to (1), but which possess characteristically different odour notes which are described as agrestic and thujone-like, and floral, green, woody odour notes.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention refers to the use of a compound of formula I as fragrance,<br><br>
wherein X is carbonyl, or -(CHOH)-; and<br>
R is methyl or ethyl, or linear or branched C3 to C5 alkyl, such as /-propyl, n-propyl, n-<br>
butyl, sec-butyl, teRT-butyl, n-pentyl, sec-pentyl, and ferf-pentyl; or<br>
R is vinyl, or linear or branched C3 to C5 alkenyl, such as propen-1-yl, propen-2-yl, allyl,<br>
but-1-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, and pentenyl; and<br>
the dotted line represents one optional double bond.<br>
3D061 WO  /23.02.05<br><br>
The compounds according to the present invention may contain one or more chiral centres and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomerically pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC or by stereoselective syntheses.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula I are 1-cyclooct-3-enylethanone, 1-cyclooct-3-enylpropan-1 -one, 1 -cyclooct-3-enyl-2-methylpropan-1 -one, 1 -cyclooct-3-enylpropan-1 -ol, 1-cyclooct-4-enylethanone, 1-cyclooct-2-enylethanone, 1-cyclooct-2-enylethanol, 1-cyclooct-1-enylethanone, 1-cyclooctylpropanone, 1-cyclooctyl-2-methylpropanone, and 1 -cyclooctyl-2-methylpropanol.<br>
Particularly preferred are compounds of formula I having a double bond at position C-3, i.e. a compound of formula I wherein the bond between C-3 and C-4 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, and the bonds between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-<br>
3,	and C-4 and C-5 represent each a single bond, such as 1-cyclooct-3-enylethanone,<br>
1-cyclooct-3-enylpropan-1-one, 1-cyclooct-3-enyl-2-methylpropan-1-one and 1-<br>
cyclooct-3-enylpropan-1-ol.<br>
As used in relation to compounds of formula I "one optional double bond" refers to compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C-1 and C-2 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, and the bonds between C-2 and C-3, C-3 and C-<br>
4,	and C-4 and C-5 represent each a single bond; or the bond between C-2 and C-3<br>
together with the dotted line represents a double bond, and the bonds between C-1 and<br>
C-2, C-3 and C-4, and C-4 and C-5 represent each a single bond; or the bond between<br>
C-3 and C-4 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, and the bonds<br>
between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-3, and C-4 and C-5 represent each a single bond; or<br>
the bond between C-4 and C-5 together with the dotted line represents a double bond,<br>
and the bonds between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-3, and C-3 and C-4 represent each a<br><br>
single bond; or the bonds between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-3, C-3 and C-4, and C-4 and C-5 represent each a single bond.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be used alone or in combination with known odourant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural products and synthetic molecules currently available, such as essential oils, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, ethers and acetals, esters and lactones, macrocycles and heterocycles, and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or excipients conventionally used in conjunction with odourants in fragrance compositions, for example, carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art.<br>
The following list comprises examples of known odourant molecules, which may be combined with the compounds of the present invention:<br>
natural products: tree moss absolute, basil oil, tropical fruit oils (such as bergamot oil, mandarin oil, etc.), mastix absolute, myrtle oil, palmarosa oil, patchouli oil, petitgrain oil, wormwood oil, lavender oil, rose oil, jasmin oil, ylang-ylang oil.<br>
alcohols: farnesol, geraniol, linalool, nerol, phenylethyl alcohol, rhodinol, cinnamic alcohol, (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol, menthol, a-terpineol.<br>
aldehydes: citral, a-hexyl cinnamaldehyde, Lilial, methylionone, verbenone, nootkatone, geranylacetone.<br>
esters: allyl phenoxyacetate, benzyl salicylate, cinnamyl propionate, citronellyl acetate, decyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl butyrate, ethyl acetoacetate, cis-3-hexenyl isobutyrate, cis-3-hexenyl salicylate, linalyl acetate, methyl dihydrojasmonate, styralyl propionate, vetiveryl acetate, benzyl acetate, geranyl acetate.<br>
lactones: y-undecalactone, 8-decalactone, pentadecanolide, 12-oxahexadecanolide.<br>
acetals: Viridine (phenylacetaldehyde dimethylacetal).<br><br>
other components often used in perfumery: indole, p-mentha-8-thiol-3-one, methyleugenol, eugenol, anethol.<br>
Whereas a single compound of formula I enhances, or improves on odour notes in their own right, it was found that a mixture of double bond isomers enhances the diffusion of a fragrance even more. Thus, the present invention refers in a further aspect to a fragrance composition comprising a mixture of A) a compound of formula Ic; and B) at least one compound selected from a compound of formula la, a compound of formula lb, and a compound of formula Id<br><br>
wherein X and R have the same meaning as defined above and R = R' = R"= Rm and X = X' = X" = X"'<br>
Particularly preferred are mixtures comprising a compound of formula la, a compound of formula Ic, and a compound of formula Id. Preferred mixtures are those comprising at least 50% by weight of a compound of formula Ic based on the total weight of all double bond isomers, i.e. amount of the compound of formula la + lb +lc + Id = 100% by weight.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in a broad range of fragrance [ applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functional perfumery. The compounds can be employed in wide ranging amounts depending upon the specific application and on the nature and quantity of other odourant ingredients, that may be for example, from about 0.001 to about 20 weight percent of the application. In one embodiment, compounds may be employed in a fabric softener in an amount of about 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent. In another embodiment, compounds of the present invention may be used in an alcoholic solution in amounts of about 0.1 to 20 weight percent, more preferably between about 0.1 and 5 weight percent. However, these values should not be regarded as limiting the present invention, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations, <br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by direct mixing the compound of the present invention or the fragrance composition comprising the compound with the fragrance application. Alternatively, they may be added in an entrapped form, by being in a previous step entrapped with an entrapment material, for example polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposomes, precursors, film formers, absorbents, for example by using carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, and then mixed with the application.<br>
Thus, the invention additionally provides a method of manufacturing a fragrance application, comprising the incorporation of a compound of formula I as a fragrance ingredient, either by directly admixing the compound of formula I into the application or by admixing a fragrance composition comprising a compound of formula I, which may then be mixed to a fragrance application, using conventional techniques and methods.<br>
As used herein, "fragrance application" means any product, such as fine perfumery, e.g. perfume and Eau de Toilette; household products, e.g. detergents for dishwasher, surface cleaner; laundry products, e.g. softener, bleach, detergent; body care products, e.g. shampoo, shower gel; and cosmetics, e.g. deodorant, vanishing creme, comprising an odourant. This list of products is given by way of illustration and is not to be regarded as being in any way limiting.<br>
Whereas some compounds have been described in the literature, others have not, and are novel. Thus, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of formula I <br>
wherein X is carbonyl, or -(CHOH)-; and<br>
R is methyl or ethyl, or linear or branched C3 to C5 alkyl, such as /-propyl, n-propyl, n-<br>
butyl, sec-butyl, ferf-butyl, n-pentyl, sec-pentyl, and terT-pentyl; or<br><br>
R is vinyl or linear or branched C3 to C5 alkenyl, such as propen-1-yl, propen-2-yl, allyl,<br>
but-1-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, and pentenyl; and<br>
the dotted line represents one optional double bond;<br>
provided that<br>
when X is carbonyl and one of the bonds between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-3, and C-3<br>
and C-4 together with the dotted line is a double bond, R is not methyl or ethyl;<br>
when X is carbonyl and the bond between C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line is a<br>
double bond, R is not /-propyl;<br>
when X is carbonyl and the bond between C-3 and C-4 together with the dotted line is a<br>
double bond, R is not methyl or ethyl;<br>
when X is carbonyl and all of the bonds between C-1 and C-2, C-2 and C-3, C-3 and C-<br>
4, and C-4 and C-5 together with the dotted line represent each a single bond, R is not<br>
methyl or ethyl;<br>
when X is -(CHOH)-, R is not methyl; and<br>
when X is -(CHOH)- and the bond between C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line is<br>
a double bond, R is not ethyl.<br>
Compounds of formula I, wherein the bond between C-3 and C-4 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, i.e. substituted cyclooct-3-enes, may be prepared by the reaction of olefins with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid, well known to a person skilled in the art and described for example by Schellhammer (Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl), 1973, Band Vll/2a, pages 447-460) herein incorporated by reference, starting from cyclooctene by acylation with the appropriately substituted carboxylic acid. The resulting ketones (2) may be reduced to give further compounds of formula I as shown in scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula I, wherein the bond between C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, i.e. substituted cyclooct-2-enes, may be prepared by selective bromination of cyclooctene, resulting in 3-bromo-cyclooctene, followed by addition of the appropriate aldehyde R-CHO under Grignard type reaction conditions known to the person skilled in the art. The resulting alcohols (3) may be oxidised to give further compounds of formula I as shown in scheme 2.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C-4 and C-5 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, i.e. substituted cyclooct-4-enes, may be prepared by selective bromination under acidic conditions starting from cycloocta-1,5-diene, resulting in 5-bromo-cyclooctene, followed by addition of the appropriate aldehyde under Grignard conditions, resulting in an alcohol which may be oxidised to give further compounds of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C-1 and C-2 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, i.e. substituted cyclooct-1-enes, may be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate alkynes with cyclooctanone under alkaline conditions, followed by Rupe rearrangement under acidic conditions.<br>
Alternatively, a double bond isomeric mixture of compounds of formula I, i.e. a mixture of substituted cyclooct-1-enes, -3-enes and -4-enes, may be prepared by addition of an alkanoic acid chloride to cyclooctene followed by dehydrochlorination of the resulting chlorocycfooctyl alkanone under conditions known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Further particulars as to reaction conditions are provided in the examples.<br>
There now follows a series of non-limiting examples that illustrate the invention.<br><br>
Example 1: 1-cvclooct-3-envlethanone<br>
To cyclooctene (300 g, 2.73 mol) were added acetic anhydride (556 g, 5.45 mol) and zinc chloride (30 g, 0.22 mol). The reaction mixture was warmed to 90-95°C within 30 min., stirred at that temperature during 7.5 hours, cooled to 60°C, and treated with caution, within 10 min., with water (400 ml). The resulting mixture was heated at 100°C during 3 h., cooled to 25°C, and extracted with hexane (3 x 300 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with aq. sat. NaCI soln. (800 ml), aq. sat. NaHC03 soln. (800 ml), aq. sat. NaCI soln. (400 ml), and dried (Na2S04). Evaporation of the solvent led to 375 g of crude material which was distilled under vacuum with a short-path Vigreux column. After collecting the unreacted cyclooctene (65 g, 21.7%) at 40-50°C/100 mbar, the fractions distilling at 110°C/24 mbar were collected (144 g) and redistilled using a microdistillation column (20 x 1.5 cm, filled with 3x3 mm rolled wire netting) to give 110 g of 1-cyclooct-3-enylethanone (34% based on the reacted cyclooctene, 109°C/20 mbar) as colourless oil.<br>
