				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing cheese flavour concentrate. It is a cheap substitute for matured cheese, which is conventionally for flavouring processed chesses, spreads and other food products. The product has great commercial utility as intermediate cheese flavor ingredient for food industry.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Enormous scientific information generated in couple of years to understand the biochemistry of cheese ripening and flavour generation has established beyond doubt that the typical flavour in cheese is a complex mixture of perhaps several hundred flavour components and is achieved during ripening as a result of action of various agents like starter bacteria and non-starter bacteria, rennet, milk enzymes, etc. on lactose, protein, and fat of cheese curd. The process of ripening which is necessary for flavour development, is very slow and usually takes 4 to 6 months to develop full flavour and is costly and time consuming. Several attempts have been made in the past with varying degree of accomplishment to accelerate cheese-ripening process (Law, 1979; Lee &amp; Olson, 1982; Bottazzi and Scolari, 1983; Law, 1984; EI Soda, 1986; Fox, 1989; EI Soda and Panadian, 1991). The different methods studied to enhance ripening include addition of ripened cheese slurry (Singh and Kristoffersen, 1971; Thakar and Upadhyay, 1992); high temperature ripening (Fedrick, 1987); use of exogenous enzymes (Kanawjia and Singh, 1990; Bockelmann, 1995) and many others. It is now possible to develop typical cheese flavour in a given substrate (cheese curd slurry, recombines cheese curd, UF-retentate, buffalo milk cheese curd etc.) with the help of numerous combinations of the ripening agents (coagulants, starter culture, non-starter culture, adjunct starter, milk proteinases, lipases, etc.) and reaction conditions.<br><br>
Based on the information available in literature it was hypothesized that a controlled substrate-enzyme reaction would yield a cheese flavour in short time. The present research project was based on this hypothesis, and designed to develop concentrated cheese flavourant or more specifically Cheddar Cheese Flavour Base (CCFB) in paste and dried form, which would replace matured cheese in processed cheese and spreads. Cheese flavour base (CFB) is a variant of slurry system and enzyme-modified cheese (EMC), which involves addition of biocatalyst (mainly exogenous enzymes from starter and adjunct bacteria) to curd and/or cheese slurried and incubation at high temperature (30 to 45°C) for short time (12 to 36 h). This type of product is essentially utilized to provide a strong cheesy note at a low cost to processed cheeses and other food products (Moskowitz and Noelck, 1987). In general, the level of addition of this product in foods ranges from 0.1 to 2%, which ultimately reduces the requirement for matured cheese in processed cheese formulations (Kilara, 1985).<br>
The present investigation was undertaken with the specific objectives of a) standardization of process parameters for the production of Cheddar Cheese Flavour Base (CCFB) using biocatalysts; b) preservation of CCFB; and c) utilization of CCFB in processed cheese.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel process for producing cheddar cheese<br>
flavour concentrate<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing cheddar cheese flavour concentrate having a high flovour intensity in comparison to that of natural<br>
cheese.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing cheddar cheese flavor concentrate which may be in spray or paste form.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing cheddar cheese flavor concentrate which has a substantiate shelf life.<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
i) Cow Milk: Whole cow milk was obtained from the herd maintained in NDRI, Karnal<br>
ii) Cheddar Cheese: Cheddar Cheese from cow milk was made in experimental dairy plant using standard procedure (Kosikowski, 1982) Starter culture (NCDC-149) and adjunct bacteria (NCDC-19) and microbial rennet (i.e., Meito renner). Cow milk were used to make Cheddar cheese. The 10 kg blocks were made, dried , waxed and ripened for one month.<br>
iii) Old Cheddar Cheese (OCC) Slurry: One-month-old Cheddar Cheese was converted into slurry with Fryma disc mill/grinder. The pH, moisture and salt-in-moisture of OCC-Slurry were appropriately adjusted. The OCC-Slurry was used as substrate for biochemical reactions or ripening.<br>

vi) Process of Spray Drying of E-CCFB-paster: E-CCFB-paste was dried using spray drying process. The basic conditions for spray drying standardized were: inlet air temperature; outlet air temperature; temperature of feed; total solids of feed; type of atomizer. The targeted final product moisture ranged from 4.5-5.0%. These process condition were standardized to obtained better flavour retention and flow ability.<br>
