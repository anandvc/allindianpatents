Date: June 18,2007<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the continuous manufacture of a flexible complex of coated fabric comprises at least one, even several tight pocket(s), pocket(s) that can contain a gas, liquid or possibly a solid. The invention also relates to a flexible complex of coated fabric comprising at least one tight pocket<br>
Flexible complexes constituted by a succession of pockets are frequently used for combating pollution or also for lost forms in a marine atmosphere.<br>
The realization of these pockets most often requires a manufacture, that is, that a pocket is manufactured and then the following pocket is manufactured.<br>
The current methods of manufacture are discontinuous methods. One of the methods consists in assembling a pocket by adhesion, for example. The pockets manufactured in this manner are then successively assembled.<br>
Another method of manufacture consists in assembling two sheets of coated fabric. The uniting of the two sheets is made by heating with or without pressure and with or without the addition of material or also by simple adhesion. This uniting is realized step by step. Generally, this latter method is reserved for pockets with large dimensions.<br>
In the case of a plastic sheet the uniting can be done by high-frequency welding or also by thermal welding or possibly by adhesion. In the case of rubber sheets it is necessary to vulcanize them in advance; the uniting of the two vulcanized sheets can be made either by adhesion or by the addition of a band of non-vulcanized rubber that is vulcanized under pressure.<br>
These discontinuous technologies have the disadvantage of taking a long time and of therefore being onerous. In particular, they require a supplementary operation of continuous vulcanization before or after the manufacture for fabrics coated with rubber.<br>
-2-<br><br>
There is therefore a need for a process for manufacturing a flexible complex comprising at least one tight pocket that is less onerous while permitting the obtention of a resistant product.<br>
The inventors have discovered that a specific manufacturing process permitted the problems presented above to be resolved in entirely or in part.<br>
The present invention has the task of avoiding these disadvantages entirely or in part by proposing a process for the continuous manufacture of tight pockets comprising, in particular for fabrics coated with rubber, a vulcanization integrated into the described process.<br>
According to one of its aspects the invention has as subject matter a process for the continuous manufacture of a flexible complex comprising or constituted by at least one tight pocket comprising the steps consisting in:<br>
-	depositing an anti-adhesive agent 14 on at least one sheet of coated fabric 10 in the zones for forming the pocket or pockets,<br>
-	continuously assembling the sheet of coated fabric 10 on which the anti-adhesive agent 14 was deposited with the sheet of coated fabric 20 by heating and/or pressure.<br>
Compared to discontinuous assembly methods the using of a continuous assembly machine, in particular one operating under pressure and/or at a high temperature, can have several advantages:<br>
* At the assembly level: these are autogenous assemblies, therefore without the addition of supplementary material such as adhesive, that has a different composition than the coatings and that can constitute a weak point.<br>
-3-<br><br>
*	At the esthetic level: this process allows the use of a textile back cloth that can confer a uniform aspect. In particular, when a back cloth consisting of textile support or any other sheet is used at the moment of assembly this can confer a uniform and decorative aspect. The significant variants of back cloths can allow the product to be personalized. Finally, this operation of personalization or of decoration can be carried out at the same time as the operation of assembly and it is therefore simple and not very onerous to carry out.<br>
*	At the level of bulkiness: after the inflation of the pockets the complex realized can be substantially, even perfectly flat without a significant excess thickness, which limits its bulkiness after folding.<br>
The expression "fabric" denotes in the sense of the present invention a structure constituted by warp and woof threads that are generally perpendicular.<br>
The expression "continuous" denotes in the sense of the present invention that there is no break in the rhythm, especially no stop time. In particular, no stop between the production of a pocket and the following one.<br>
More precisely, the expression "continuous process" denotes a process in which the product exits in a regular manner without a stop between the different pockets and/or the different articles produced.<br>
"Simultaneously" means that the operations are carried out in one and the same operation and that in particular when an operation of depositing the anti-adhesive agent takes place at a certain level of the fabric, an assembly operation takes place a little further on the same fabric.<br>
More particularly, the process and/or the assembly stage is/are carried out at a substantially constant speed, that is, varying by less than 20%, in particular less than 10% and is even carried out at a constant speed.<br>
-4-<br><br>
The stage consisting in depositing the anti-adhesive agent on the coated fabric can, as far as it is concerned, be carried out step by step or continuously.<br>
The speed of the depositing of the anti-adhesive agent can be greater than or equal to 8 m/h, in particular greater than or equal to 12 m/h, in particular greater or equal to 15 m/h and even greater than or equal to 20 m/h.<br>
It is possible to provide an accumulation stage between the stage of depositing anti-adhesive and that of assembling the fabrics, in particular when the speed of the depositing of the anti-adhesive agent is greater than that of the assembly.<br>
The assembly stage can be carried out for its part at a moving speed of the coated fabric that is greater than or equal to 8 m/h, in particular greater than or equal to 12 m/h, in particular greater or equal to 15 m/h and even greater than or equal to 20 m/h.<br>
During the assembly stage it is possible to insert a back cloth, in particular a fabric. The relief of this fabric will grain or emboss coating 3. The fabric can be removed after the assembly operation. This can allow the article produced to be personalized or decorated without performing a supplementary stage in the process.<br>
The process can furthermore comprise a previous stage consisting in realizing at least two sheets of coated fabric 10 and 20.<br>
The invention also has as subject matter a process for the continuous manufacture of a succession of tight pockets formed from two sheets of coated fabrics, which fabric is constituted by warp threads and woof threads, characterized in that in that the steps of the manufacturing process are as follows: - stage 1:<br>
-5-<br><br>
-	An anti-adhesive is continuously deposited on the first sheet of coated fabric at the<br>
locations where the pockets will be found. The continuous placing of this anti-<br>
adhesive can be robotized.<br>
-step 2:<br>
-	The first sheet is continuously united to the second sheet.<br>
-	For fabrics coated with rubber, simultaneously and continuously, on the one hand the two sheets are vulcanized and on the other hand they are united in the zones without anti-adhesive by pressure and heating.<br>
-	For the fabrics coated with plastic the two sheets are continuously united in the zones without anti-adhesive by pressure and heating.<br>
According to other characteristics of the invention:<br>
The steps of depositing the anti-adhesive 14 and of assembly can be carried out simultaneously. The stages can be carried out in particular without a stop between the stage of depositing anti-adhesive agent and the assembly stage, and/or without another stage being intercalated between the stage of depositing anti-adhesive agent and the assembly stage, in other words the one directly follows the other.<br>
The fabric of each sheet can be covered with coating on one face or on both faces. The coating can comprise or be constituted by at least one layer of rubber or at least one layer of plastic.<br>
The anti-adhesive agent can be constituted by a product incompatible with the coating of the sheets and supportive of pressure such as, e.g., a non-melting film, a powder, a dispersion or a solution of anti-adhesive.<br>
This manufacturing process is not limited to two sheets of coated fabric but rather it is possible to assemble N sheets.<br>
-6-<br><br>
In this instance the assembly can be made with N-l sheets of coated fabric that have the anti-adhesive agent 14 (figure No. 1) and 1 sheet without anti-adhesive agent.<br>
Figure No. 1 is a schematic view in perspective of the complex comprising two sheets of coated tissue 10 and 20 and one anti-adhesive 14 in order to form tight pockets.<br>
The following description of the manufacturing process is an example given by way of example.<br>
The sheets of fabric coated with rubber 10 and 20 are realized in a preparatory stage. The different steps of this realization schematized in figure 2 (sectional view) and figure 3 (perspective view) are as follows:<br>
*	Continuous deposition of an adhesive 2 on fabric 1, figures 2, 3, which adhesive is a<br>
dispersion or a polymer solution.<br>
The adhesive can be deposited on a single face of the fabric or on both faces. This adhesive is deposited in order to permit the obtention of a good adherence between elements 1 and 3.  It is made on a spreader and the adhesive is formulated in such a manner as to have a good adherence between fabric 1 and coating 3.<br>
*	Drying of this dispersion or solution.<br>
*	Continuous depositing by calendaring on the adhesive layer of at least one layer<br>
of a coating 3, figure 2, which is a mixture of rubber formulated in such a manner as<br>
to render the pockets tight and to correspond to the usage characteristics of the<br>
device. Anti-adhesive 14 is placed with the sheets of coated fabrics realized in this<br>
manner in the first stage on the first sheet of coated fabric 10 at the area<br>
corresponding to the pockets. This anti-adhesive agent can comprise or be<br>
constituted either by a non-melting film or by a powder such as talcum or Bentone<br>
or by a dispersion or a solution of anti-adhesive.<br>
-7-<br><br>
In the second stage of uniting, the sheet of coated fabric 10 that received anti-adhesive 14 is assembled onto sheet 20 without anti-adhesive by heating and/or pressure. The heating allows the rubber to become vulcanized and the pressure imparts cohesion and adherence on the one hand between the fabrics 1 and 2 and the coating 3 and on the other hand between the sheets of coated fabrics 10 and 20 at the locations where there is no anti-adhesive.<br>
This operation can be performed continuously on a machine comprising a heated cylinder and an apron feed provided with jacks in order to ensure the pressure or also by passage between two cylinders of which one or both can be covered with polymer in order to ensure a uniform pressure.<br>
In particular, the two-stages described above are performed simultaneously. Furthermore, the process can comprise a stage that allows the flexible complex to present a system A that permits the filling, in particular the inflating of all the pockets 6 at one time and/ or at a single point.<br>
This system A can correspond to passages 4 connecting pockets 6 one after the other, thus allowing them to be filled at one time and/or at a single point.<br>
Figure 4 represents an embodiment of a flexible complex comprising a system A. This stage of the unit of system A can be realized in particular by a stage of the process in which the depositing of an anti-adhesive is also carried out at the locations intended to form passages 4 between pockets 6, in particular where it is desired that the pockets communicate.<br>
According to a variant the placing of the anti-adhesive intended to permit the formation of system A can be concomitant with the placing of the anti-adhesive agent intended to permit the formation of the pockets.<br>
-8-<br><br>
However, a flexible complex in which the pockets are connected to each other can have the disadvantage that in the case of a leak all the pockets can become empty.<br>
In order to remedy this problem entirely or in part the inventors discovered a system that allows the volume to be limited that can escape in case of a leak, especially of the type in which the wall of a pocket is pierced.<br>
The process can therefore comprise a stage that allows the obtention of a flexible complex in which it is possible to obturate passages 4 existing between the pockets, especially when the latter are filled, e.g., by a gas, liquid or a solid.<br>
This can be realized in particular by a stage consisting in depositing, before or during the assembly of the sheets, an obturator 5 at the level of the locations intended to form passages 4 between the pockets, in other words, at the level of system A, or also at the level of the distribution zone intended to form a passage between the pockets.<br>
This obturator 5, in particular inflatable, can consist of a tube 5 with an adjustable diameter, in particular elastic, with a diameter at rest lower than the size of the passages between the pockets in such a manner that the pockets can be filled at a single time and/or at a single point.<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment of a flexible complex comprising an obturator 5 in which the latter is an inflatable elastic tube.<br>
This obturator 5 can allow passages 4 between pockets 6 to be obturated in a single operation, e.g. by filling it.<br>
Once pockets 6 are filled, the diameter of tube 5 can be increased in such a manner that it comes to rest on the walls of passages 4 between the pockets and obturates them.   The increase of the diameter of tube 5 can be due to its being filled, in<br>
-9-<br><br>
particular by air. In this instance tube 5 can be realized by a plastic or elastomeric material with a great return force and a low modulus.<br>
Figure 6 shows an embodiment of an obturation.<br>
According to a particular embodiment the process comprises the stages consisting in:<br>
-	depositing anti-adhesive 14 on a coated fabric at the location intended to form<br>
pockets 6 and passages 4 that allowed the various pockets to be inflated,<br>
-depositing tube 5 at the level of the surface defined by the anti-adhesive, which tube allows passages 4 between pockets 6 to be obturated, in particular once the latter have been filled,<br>
-	continuously assembling the sheet of coated fabric 10 on which the anti-adhesive<br>
agent 14 was deposited to the sheet of coated tissue 20 by heating and/or pressure.<br>
The above-described process can permit in particular flexible complexes to be produced that comprise several pockets that are parallel and/or successive.<br>
According to another one of its aspects the invention has as subject matter a flexible complex comprising at least one tight pocket 6, the internal surface of which pocket is covered entirely or in part and in particular on one of its faces with an anti-adhesive agent.<br>
The tight pockets can:<br>
-	each comprise a valve allowing the filling of each pocket, which implies a<br>
discontinuous inflating, pocket by pocket,<br>
-	be connected to each other in such a manner that all the pockets can be inflated at<br>
one time, which is then a continuous inflation.<br>
- 10-<br><br>
More precisely, passages 4 between pockets 6 can comprise an obturator 5, especially inflatable, e.g., of the bladder or tube type, especially elastic, that permits these passages to be obturated.<br>
The flexible complexes described in the present patent can be:<br>
-	flexible, inflatable dams, especially useful when combating aquatic pollution,<br>
-	concrete forms, especially for maritime applications,<br>
-	inflatable rafts or boats,<br>
-	inflatable structures, e.g., rapid deployment tent, decontamination shower or<br>
-	inflatable or weighted dikes, especially for combating floods.<br>
