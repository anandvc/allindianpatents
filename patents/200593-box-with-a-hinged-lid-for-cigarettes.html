The invention relates to a hinge-lid box foe cigarettes or the like, having a box part and a lid hinged on a box rear wall, and having 3 collar anchored in the box part and having a collar front wall and collar side walls, its region projecting out of the box part being enclosed by the lid in the closed position, a lid front wall being bounded by a (lowerl lid closing edge and a box front wall of the box part being bounded by an (upperi opposing closing edge.<br>
Conventional hinge-lid boxes are designed in such a way that the transversely oriented lid closing edge rests on the likewise transversely oriented opposing closing edge of the box part when in the closed position. However, a hinge-lid box has already been disclosed which has an oblique lid closing edge and a correspondingly oblique, opposing closing edge, there being a spacing between the lid closing edge and the opposing closing edge arranged parallel to the latter, so that a strip-like area of the collar front wall is even visible in the closed position of the lid.<br>
The invention is based en the object of further developing [cigarette) packs of the hinge-lid type primarily with regard to the shaping of the front side, and also of irprcving their handling.<br>
In order to achieve this object, che hinge-lid box according to the invention is characterized in that the lid closing edge and the opposing closing edge are arranged at distances from each other which vary over the pack width.<br>
/I<br><br>
The hinge-lid box according to the invention is therefore designed so that the preferably transversely running lid closing edge and the opposing edge have different contours. Tliis produces different shapes in the region of the front side of the pack, geomeliically differently shaped regions of the area of the collar front wall being visible in the closed position of the pack. At least this region of the collar front wall can be configured ornamentally or graphically, or can also contain infomiation for the user.<br>
The distance between the lid closing edge and opposing closing edge ensures easier handling when opening, specifically when lifting, the lid. The gap formed between the two closing edges does not according to the invention, have to extent over the complete width of the hinge-lid box, but can be fonned in a central or laterally offset region. Outside the gap. the lid closing edge and opposing closing edge can rest on each other in die con\'entiQnal way or with a particular" coinciding contour.<br>
The configuration of the hinge-lid box according to the invention, specifically with regard to the contour of the lid closing edge and the opposing closing edge, can ad\antageously be combined with a further configuradon feature, specifically with a round-edge pack or oblique-edge pack, that is to say with hinge-lid boxes in which the upright pack edges ha\e a rounded or bevelled cross section, at least in the region of the front side.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to the hinge-lid box for cigarettes, comprising a box pait and a lid hinged on a box rear wall, and also comprising a collar with a collar front wall and collar side walls, a lower lid closing edge of a lid front wall being located at a distance opposite an upper opposing closing edge of a box front<br><br>
wall when the lid is closed, thereby fonning an opening with an exposed area of the collar fi'ont wall, characterized m lliat the lid closing edge and the opposing closing edge have a non-uniform distance from each other in an ai'ea of the opening, specifically a distance which vaiies over a width of the opening, the lid closing edge has a continuously rectilinear course oriented transversely with respect to upright pack edges, the lid closing edge is a folding edge between the lid iront wall and a lid inner tab resting on the inside ofthe said lid fi*ont wall, and the opposing closing edge has a course which differs fi-oni the lid closing edge, specifically being curved or angled.<br>

Hinge-lid boxes comprise a (lower) box part 10 and an (upper) lid 11 connected to the latter. Box part 10 and lid 11 are connected to each other firstly in the area of a box rear wall 12 and secondly in the area of a lid rear wall 13, via a transversely oriented hinge 14. The box part 10 further comprises a box front wall 15 and box side walls 16, IV. The lower closure of the box Darts 10 is a bottom wall 18.<br><br>
In a way similar to this, the lid 11 comprises a lid<br>
front wail 19, lid side walls 20, 21 and an end wall 22.<br>
The box side walls 16, 17 and, in a corresponding way, the lid side walls 20, 21 comprise side tabs 23, 24 which overlap one another wholly or partially and, respectively, of lid side tabs 25, 25. Mutually associated side tabs are connected to each other by adhesive bonding. In addition, in most exemplary embodiments of hinge-lid boxes, a lid inner tab 27 is provided. The latter is connected to a free edge of the lid front wall 17 and is folded over against the inside of the same and fised to it.<br>
A classically constructed hinge-lid box further includes a collar 28. This comprises a separate blank (e.g. Fig. 9) . The collar 28 comprises a collar front wall 29 and collar side walls 30, 31. In the area of the collar front wall 29 there is a cut-out 32 open at the top. This cut-out is bounded by an approximately U-shaped collar edge 33.<br>
One special feature of the present hinge-lid boxes is the configuration of closing edges of the box part 10, on the one hand, and. of the lid II, on the other hand.. The lid front wall 19 forms a lid closing edge 34 with its lower edge. If a lid inner tab 2 7 is present (e.g. Fig. 1, Fig. 2], this lid closing edge 34 is formed by a folded edge of the lid inner tab 27 and the lid front wall 19.<br>
In conventional hinge-lid boxes, when the lid 11 is closed, the lid closing edge 34 rests on an opposing closing edge 35, which is formed by an upper edge of the box front wall 15. The present hinge-lid boxes are constructed in such a way that the lid closing edge 34 rests on the opposing closing edge 35 only in some<br><br>
areas or over the entire width with a possibly variable distance from the opposing closing edge 35.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Figs. 1 to 3, the lid closing edge 34 is oriented horizontally or transversely at right angles to upright pack edges 35.<br>
The opposing closing edge 35 of the box part 10 has a different contour, is of V-shaped design, specifically with two edge limbs 37, 38 running towards each other at an obtuse angle. In the present case, these run together centrally in an elevation or point 39. The opposing closing edge 35 is arranged overall at a distinct distance from the lid closing edge 34, in such a way that a gap 4 0 extending over the full width of the pack front side is formed. In this area, when the pack is closed {Fig. 1) one sub-area of the collar front wall 29 is visible, to be specific in a geometric shape determined by the shape of the closing edges. At least in this area, the collar front wall 29 may be decorative or have informative printing.<br>
Closing edges are also formed in the region of the pack side walls, to be specific in a shape which rises obliquely towards the pack rear side. In this case, these are obligue edges 41 as lower boundaries of the lid side walls, 20, 21, and correspondingly arranged obligue edges 42 as upper boundaries of the box side walls 16, 17. When the lid 11 is closed, the oblique edges 41, 42 lie on each other.<br>
The blank (Fig. 3) for a pack designed in this way is shaped accordingly. The box front wail 15 is bounded at the free end of the blank by the angled opposing closing edge 35. In the area of the pack edges 36, this merges into a longitudinal edge 4 3 running in the direction of the pack edges 36. This is followed by the respective oblique edge 42 of the outer side tab 24.<br><br>
The collar or the cellar front wall 29 is matched to the contour of the opposing closing edge 35, specifically is likewise angularly shaped, so that regions of the collar edge 33 run approximately parallel to the opposing closing edge 33.<br>
In their fundamental construction, the hinge-lid boxes according to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 likewise correspond to a conventional hinge-lid box. As in the present exemplary embodiment, the lid closing edge 34 is of rectilinear shape and runs transversely with respect to the rectangular pack edges 36.<br>
Designed in a particular way is the opposing closing edge 35 as the upper boundary of the box front wall 15. In the central area of the box front wall 15, a depression 44 is formed. This depression is bounded by a circular or partly circular section 45 of the opposing closing edge 35. When the hinge-lid box is closed (Fig. 4), a field of view, with an approximately circular area, of the collar front wall 2 9 can be seen on the front. This field is bounded on one side by Che section 45 of the opposing closing edge 35 and on the other side by the transverse lid closing edge 34.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the collar 23 is formed in the conventional way. In addition, the blank for this pack in principle corresponds to a conventional blank for this pack type, only the depression 44 having CO be formed by appropriate stamping in the area of the box front wall 15.<br>
In the hinge-lid box according to Fig. 6 to Fig. 9, a distinction from the previous configuration principle is provided in as much as the lid closing edge 34 also has a special contour, specifically wavy or zigzag-like in the present case. The lid closing edge 34 comprises<br><br>
two side limbs 46, 47 and a central section 48. All the regions of the lid closing edge 3 4 run obliquely, that is to say at an angle to the pack edges 36. One side limb 45 - starting from the pack edge 36 - is oriented obliquely downwards. Its centre section 48 adjoining this is oriented obliquely upwards, and the other side limb 47 is designed to fall obliquely in the direction of the pack edge 36. Round curves 4 9 are provided as a transition between the edge sections.<br>
The opposing closing edge 35 of the box front wall 15 is formed in a similar way, and therefore runs overall parallel to the lid closing edge 34, but at a distinct distance. Accordingly, the opposing closing edge 35 also forms side limbs 4 6, 4 7 and a central section 48. In this way, a zigzag-like or wavy form of the gap 4 0 is created, with a corresponding visible region of the area of the collar front wall 29. The blank (Fig. 8) for this pack form is designed accordingly. As distinct from the preceding exemplary embodiments, there is no lid inner tab. Instead, the lid front wall 19 forms the lid closing edge 34 directly and in one layer, the said lid closing edge 34 being formed in the manner described. The side limbs 46, 47 merge into the oblique edges 41 of the lid side walls 20, 21.<br>
The  oppos ite   end  o f   the  b1ank   is   des igned correspondingly in the area of the box front wall 15, specifically with the opposing closing edge 35. This is<br>
adjoined by the longitudinal edges 43, which merge into the oblique edges 42.<br>
The collar 28 (Fig. 9] is also formed in a particular way. The collar front wall 29 has a cut-out 32 which is arranged asymmetrically, specifically offset to the side, and which is bounded by two edge regions 50, 51 running towards each other at an acute angle. In this case, the collar 28 is arranged and shaped in such a way that the edge region 51 of the collar edge 33 runs<br><br>
parallel to the central section 48 of the opposing closing edge 35.<br>
In the hinge-lid box according to Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, the opposing closing edge 35 of the box front wall 15 is designed to be wavy with two lateral depressions 52, 53 and a central or centrally arranged curved elevation 54. The transversely oriented, rectilinear lid closing edge 34 rests on the elevation 54 of the opposing closing edge 35 in the closed position (Fig. 10). This produces two lateral fields of view 55, 56, in the area of which the collar front wall 29 can be seen.<br>
The above-described configuration of the closing edges is appiled in a hinge-1 id box having round edges, that is to say with upright pack edges 3 6 which have a rounded, circular cross section, corresponding to the dimensions of a cigarette. In this case, the opposing closing edge 3 5 extends as far as the region of the round edges or as far as a boundary of the round edges which faces the box side walls 16, 17 (Fig. 11). The opposing closing edge 35 forms rounded portions 57 here, which are followed by upright longitudinal edges 43.<br>
The collar 28 is designed accordingly, specifically with a collar edge 33 running in a wave shape.. The contour is matched to the shape of the opposing closing edge 35, that is to say with a central, wavy elevation.<br>
The hinge-lid box according to Fig. 12 to Fig. 14 also relates to a round-edge pack, that is to say a hinge-lid box with rounded pack edges 36. The opposing closing edge 35 forrvvs two curved edge sections 58, 59, which run together centrally in a point 60 oriented upwards. At the edges, the edge sections 58, 59 merge inco the oblique edges 42 without any step, that is to say in a curve.<br><br>
The lid front wall 19 is configured in a particular way. The lid closing edge 34 is approximately S-shaped with a downwardly oriented convexity 61 and an opposite convexity 62 running upwards. The convexity 61 running downwards is dimensioned and shaped in such a way that it corresponds with the corresponding part of the opposing closing edge 35. The convexity 61 enters the region of the box front wall 15 with a form fit in such a way that the convexity 61 rests on the edge section 58 of the opposing closing edge 35. On the opposite side, an approximately oval field of view 63 is produced off-centre. In this region, the collar front wall 29 is visible.<br>
The lid 11 or the lid front wall 19 is provided with a lid inner tab 27. The latter is provided at the free edge (blank according to Fig. 14) with a transversely oriented, rectilinear marginal edge 54. On the side facing the lid front wall 19, the lid inner tab 2 7 is contoured in a wave shape corresponding to the lid closing edge 34. A subsection of the connection between lid inner tab 27 and lid front wall 19 is designed as a curved severing cut 65. Another region tdashed in Fig. 141 forms a folding edge 65. In the folded position (Fig. 13), the lid inner tab 27 is located in an oblique position or with the marginal edge 64 oriented obliquely.<br>
With regard to the collar edge 33, the collar 28 is also adapted to the contour of the opposing closing edge 35 in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
r"ig. 15 to Fig. 17 also show details of a hinge-lid box with rounded pack edges 36. The opposing closing edge 3 5 on the box front wall 15 has a contour with two rounded edge sections 67 and 6 8. These run together centrally in a point 69 pointing downwards. At the edges and in the region of the box side walls 16, 17,<br><br>
the edge sections 67, 68 merge into the oblique edges<br>
42 with rounded portions 57.<br>
The lid front wall 19 (without lid inner tabs) has a curved lid closing edge 34. The latter runs over the full width of the pack front side at a distance from the opposing closing edge 35. A field of view or a gap 40 is therefore produced, extending over the complete width of the pack.<br>
Fig. 18 to Fig. 21 concern details of a hinge-lid box which is suitable for round or bevelled pack edges 36, but in the present case has conventional pack edges 36 with a rectangular cross section. The lid closing edge 3 4 and opposing closing edge 35 rest on each other or are immediately opposite each other in one sub-area. In another sub-area of the pack width, the closing edges 34, 35 run at a distance from each other, so that a gap 40 is produced, which extends only over a sub-area of the front side of the hinge-lid box.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown, the lid overall is formed in a conventional way, specifically with [rectangular) lid inner tabs 27 and rectilinear lid closing edge 34 oriented transversely with respect to the pack edges 36. In addition., the opposing edge 35 here comprises only rectilinear part-edges, which run parallel to the lid closing edge 34. In this case, this is a first, marginal (left-hand) part-edge 70. This runs at a distance from the lid closing edge 34. A transitional edge 71 adjoins the part-edge 70 approximately centrally with an oblique course as far as a second part-edge 72. The latter extends in a different (right-hand) sub-area of the pack front side, to be specific parallel to the part-edge 70, but offset in such a way that, in this area, the lid closing edge 34 and opposing closing edge 35 rest on each other when the lid 11 is closed. The gap 4 0 formed in this way<br><br>
extends over a sub-area of the front side, specifically approximately as far as the centre.<br>
In the area of the box side wall 16, the part-edge 7 0 merges via a connecting edge 73 into the oblique edge 42 of the side tab 24. The connecting edge 73 extends in the relevant pack edge 36. On the opposite side, the part-edge 72 merges directly in a conventional way into the corresponding oblique edge 42.<br>
The collar 28 is also shaped in a particular way, nainely being adapted to the contour of the opposing closing edge 35. Accordingly, the collar edge 33 comprises two mutually offset part-edges and a transitional edge, substantially parallel to the contour of the opposing closing edge 35. To make the f cigarettes easier, the cut-out 32 in the region of the collar front wall 29 is shaped in such a way that to one side (on the left) a depression 7 4 is formed, which opens a larger area of the cigarettes when the lid 11 is open.<br><br>
