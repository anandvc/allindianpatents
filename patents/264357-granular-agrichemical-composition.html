				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
GRANULAR AGRICHEMICAL COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a granular<br>
agricultural chemical composition containing a<br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient<br>
which can efficiently control harmful insects breeding<br>
in paddy fields and plowed fields.  More particularly,<br>
it relates to a granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition which comprises basic inorganic mineral<br>
granules coated with a nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
The nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredients include, for example, thiocyclam oxalate<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "TCHO"), cartap<br>
hydrochloride, bensultap, etc.  They are insecticides<br>
which act as contact toxicity or stomach poison, and<br>
also exhibit activity by submerged application, and<br>
furthermore they are expected to have residual<br>
activity.  They are effective against Scirtothrips<br>
dorsalis Hood, leafhoppers and rice stem withering<br>
nematode as well as insects belonging to Lepidoptera<br><br>
and Coleoptera, and they are less in chemical injury<br>
(Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
[0003]<br>
It is known that the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredients undergo hydrolysis under<br>
alkaline conditions and are unstable (Non-Patent<br>
Document 2).  Therefore, it is naturally avoided to use<br>
basic inorganic minerals such as calcium carbonate as<br>
granular nuclei of granular composition containing a<br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient,<br>
and no granular compositions using basic inorganic<br>
minerals have been known.<br>
[0004]<br>
For improving the stability of nereistoxin<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredients in<br>
formulations, there have been known formulations coated<br>
with a waxy material which is solid at room temperature<br>
(Patent Document 1).<br>
[0005]<br>
It is reported that among nereistoxin<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredients, only<br>
bensultap has been formulated stably under basic<br>
conditions.  For example, there are a report on solid<br>
besultap formulations using calcium carbonate as an<br>
extender (Patent Document 2) and a report that<br>
bensultap in formulations can be stabilized by<br>
containing a basic oxide such as calcium oxide, zinc<br>
oxide or magnesium oxide (Patent Document 3).<br><br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
However, it has not been reported that<br>
formulations of TCHO and cartap hydrochloride have been<br>
stably obtained under basic conditions, and stable<br>
formulations of overall nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredients have not yet been found.<br>
When a granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition is to be prepared, basic inorganic mineral<br>
materials such as calcium carbonate usable as an<br>
extender are high in safety and inexpensive, but they<br><br>
cannot be used for obtaining formulations of<br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredients<br>
which are unstable under basic conditions.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0008]<br>
The inventors have conducted researches on<br>
various extenders, vehicles and stabilizers usable for<br>
granular composition in the fields of agriculture and<br>
horticulture, and as a result, have found that though<br>
it is known that nereistoxin agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredients decompose under alkaline conditions,<br>
the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredients can be stably coated on basic inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei such as calcium carbonate.<br>
That is, it has been found that even when basic<br>
inorganic mineral granular nuclei are used as an<br>
extender, a stable granular composition can be obtained<br>
by coating a mixture of the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient and phosphoric acid as a<br>
stabilizer on basic inorganic mineral granular nuclei<br>
such as calcium carbonate using an oleophilic liquid as<br>
an adhesive.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to the<br>
following embodiments.<br>
[0009]<br>
(1)  A granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition which comprises a nereistoxin agricultural<br><br>
chemical active ingredient as an agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient, inorganic mineral granular nuclei<br>

an extender, an oleophilic liquid as an adhesive and<br>
phosphoric acid as a stabilizer.<br>

composition described in the above (1) or (2), wherein<br>
the oleophilic liquid is liquid paraffin.<br>
(4)	A granular agricultural chemical<br>

which additionally contains a solidification inhibitor.<br>
(5)	A granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition described in any one of the above (l)-(4)<br>
which comprises 65-98% by weight of basic inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei, 1.0-20.0% by weight of a<br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient,<br>
0.5-10% by weight of an oleophilic liquid,0.05-0.5% by<br>
weight of phosphoric acid and 0-2% by weight of a<br>
solidification inhibitor.<br>
(6)	A granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition described in any one of the above (l)-(5),<br>
wherein the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient and phosphoric acid are coated on the<br><br>
inorganic mineral granular nuclei using the oleophilic<br>
liquid as an adhesive.<br>
(7)	A granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition described in any one of the above (l)-(6)<br>
which is obtained by adding the nereistoxin<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredient and phosphoric<br>
acid to a composition comprising a mixture of inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei and the oleophilic liquid and<br>
mixing them to coat the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient.<br>
(8)	A granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition described in any one of the above (6) or<br>
(7), wherein a solidification inhibitor is mixed with<br>
the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient<br>
and/or phosphoric acid.<br>
(9)	A method for producing a granular<br>
agricultural chemical composition described in any one<br>
of the above (l)-(8) which comprises mixing the<br>
inorganic mineral granular nuclei with the oleophilic<br>
liquid, then adding the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient and phosphoric acid to the<br>
mixture and mixing them to coat the nereistoxin<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredient.<br>
(10)	A method for producing a granular<br>
agricultural chemical composition described in the<br>
above (9), wherein a solidification inhibitor is mixed<br>
with the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient and/or phosphoric acid.<br><br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0010]<br>
Although basic inorganic mineral granular<br>
nuclei such as calcium carbonate are used as extender,<br>
the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient<br>
in the granular agricultural chemical composition is<br>
stable for a long period of time by using an oleophilic<br>
liquid and phosphoric acid as a stabilizer in<br>
combination.<br>

carbamate), Dinotefuran ((RS)-l-methyl-2-nitro-3-<br>
(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine), Acetamiprid ((E)-<br><br>
N-t 6-chloro-3-pyridyl]methyl)-N'-cyano-N-<br>
methylacetoamidine), Thiamethoxam (3-(2-chloro-l,3-<br>

[0013]<br>
Examples of the basic inorganic mineral<br>
granular nuclei contained in the inorganic mineral<br>
granular nuclei used as an extender in the present<br>
invention are calcium carbonate, talc, calcium oxide,<br>
etc., and calcium carbonate which is available in a<br>
large amount is preferred.  The above basic inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei may be used each alone or in<br>
admixture of two or more.  In the present invention,<br>
inorganic mineral granular nuclei which are not basic,<br><br>
such as sea sand, quartz and silica sand may be present<br>
in the basic inorganic mineral granular nuclei.  The<br>
basic inorganic mineral granular nuclei contained in<br>
the inorganic mineral granular nuclei used in the<br>
present invention may be contained in an optional<br>
amount in the range of usually 5-100% by weight.<br>
[0014]<br>
Usually, in the case of granular agricultural<br>
chemical composition obtained by coating inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei with an agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient, the proportion in weight of the<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredient coated on<br>
granular nuclei of smaller diameter to the weight of<br>
the granular nuclei is greater, and, on the other hand,<br>
the proportion in weight of the agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient coated on granular nuclei of larger<br>
diameter to the weight of the granular nuclei is<br>
smaller.  Thus, there is a difference in contents of<br>
these agricultural chemical active ingredients, and<br>
sometimes there occurs variation in the results of<br>
content analysis, which causes hindrance to control of<br>
quality.  Therefore, particle size distribution of the<br>
inorganic mineral granular nuclei used in the present<br>
invention is usually 0.05-2.0 mm, preferably 0.06-1.7<br>
mm.  The amount of the inorganic mineral granular<br>
nuclei used is usually 65-98% by weight, preferably 75-<br>
95% by weight in the composition.<br>
[0015]<br><br>
As the oleophilic liquids used as an adhesive<br>
in the granular agricultural chemical composition of<br>
the present invention, there may be used liquid<br>
paraffin (e.g., Moresco White 60, Moresco White 40,<br>
Moresco White 30 (trademarks) manufactured by Matsumura<br>
Sekiyu Kagaku Kenkyujo), petroleum fraction, animal and<br>
vegetable oils, etc., and the oleophilic liquids can be<br>
selected from those which have a viscosity of usually<br>
68 mm/s2 (40°C) or lower, preferably 1.5-20 mm/s2 (40°C) ,<br>
more preferably 1.75-13 mm/s2 (40°C).  These can be used<br>
each alone or in admixture of two or more, and the<br>
oleophilic liquids are not limited to the above<br>
examples.  The content of the oleophilic liquids in the<br>
granular agricultural chemical composition is usually<br>
about 0.5-10% by weight, preferably about 1.0-5.0% by<br>
weight.<br>
[0016]<br>
The phosphoric acid used as a stabilizer in<br>
the granular agricultural chemical composition of the<br>
present invention is preferably higher than industrial<br>
grade (75%).  The amount of phosphoric acid is usually<br>
0.05-0.5% by weight, preferably 0.1-0.3% by weight in<br>
the composition.  The method of addition of phosphoric<br>
acid is not particularly limited, and preferred are the<br>
following methods.<br>
(1)  The nereistoxin agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient is mixed with phosphoric acid to<br>
prepare a premix.<br><br><br>
(2)	After the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient is adhered to the inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei, phosphoric acid is added.<br>
(3)	After an adhesive (oleophilic liquid) is<br>
added to the inorganic mineral granular nuclei and<br>
before the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient is adhered, phosphoric acid is added alone.<br>
(4)	A mixture of phosphoric acid and the<br>
following solidification inhibitor (such as white<br>
carbon) at 1:1 is added.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition of the present invention, in order to<br>
inhibit solidification of the nereistoxin agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient during storage of the<br>
composition, if necessary, there may be used white<br>
carbon (e.g., SIPERNAT 22S (trademark) manufactured by<br>
Degussa Co., Ltd.), diatomaceous earth, magnesium<br>
stearate, aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, clay,<br>
vermiculite, pumice, etc.  Not only the nereistoxin<br>
agricultural chemical active ingredient, but also the<br>
above powders may also be added to the powder to be<br>
coated on the granular nuclei.<br>
The solidification inhibitor is used in an<br>
amount of usually 0-2% by weight, preferably 0.2-0.7%<br>
by weight in the granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition.<br>
[0018]<br><br>
A surface active agent can also be added to<br>
the granular agricultural chemical composition of the<br>
present invention.  The surface active agents include,<br>
for example, nonionic surface active agents, anionic<br>
surface active agents, cationic surface active agents<br>
and amphoteric surface active agents which are commonly<br>
used for agricultural chemical formulations.  Specific<br>
examples of the surface active agents are nonionic<br>
surface active agents such as polyoxyethylenealkylaryl<br>
ethers, polyoxyethylenestyrylphenyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylenealkyl esters, polyoxyethylenephenyl<br>
ether polymers, polyoxyethylenealkylenearylphenyl<br>
ethers, and polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene block<br>
polymers, anionic surface active agents such as<br>
polyoxyethylenestyrylphenyl ether sulfate, lignin<br>
sulfonic acid salts, alkylaryl sulfonates, and alkyl<br>
naphthalenesulfonates, cationic surface active agents<br>
such as alkyl betaine and quaternary ammonium salts,<br>
and amphoteric surface active agents.<br>
[0019]<br>
The granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition of the present invention    is usually<br>
obtained by mixing well the inorganic mineral granular<br>
nuclei with the oleophilic liquid by a mixer, and<br>
thereafter adding phosphoric acid and a powder<br>
containing the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient, followed by mixing well by a mixer to coat<br>
the active ingredient.  The powder containing the<br><br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient and<br>
phosphoric acid can be added in an optional order.<br>
Specifically, there are the following<br>
methods, and the granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition can be produced by any of these methods.<br>
(1)	The inorganic mineral granular nuclei<br>
are mixed with oleophilic liquid, then phosphoric acid<br>
is added to the mixture, and thereafter a powder<br>
containing the nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient is added, followed by mixing to obtain<br>
coated granules.<br>
(2)	A powder obtained by adsorbing<br>
phosphoric acid to the solidification inhibitor (such<br>
as white carbon) is added to a mixture of inorganic<br>
mineral granular nuclei and oleophilic liquid, and then<br>
a powder containing nereistoxin agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient is added, followed by mixing to<br>
obtain coated granules.<br>
(3)	The inorganic mineral granular nuclei<br>
are mixed with oleophilic liquid, then a powder<br>
containing nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient is added, followed by mixing to coat the<br>
active ingredient, and then phosphoric acid is added to<br>
obtain coated granules.<br>
(4)	The inorganic mineral granular nuclei<br>
are mixed with oleophilic liquid, then a powder<br>
containing nereistoxin agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient is added, followed by mixing to coat the<br><br>
active ingredient, and then a powder of solidification<br>
inhibitor (white carbon, etc.) to which phosphoric acid<br>
is adsorbed is added to obtain coated granules.<br>
(5) The inorganic mineral granular nuclei are<br>
mixed with oleophilic liquid, then a powder containing<br>
nereistoxin agricultural chemical active ingredient and<br>
phosphoric acid is added, followed by mixing to obtain<br>
coated granules.<br>
[0020]<br>
The granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition of the present invention exhibits<br>
insecticidal effect against harmful insects for farm<br>
products by direct application to paddy field or soil<br>
of plowed field.<br>
[0021]<br>
The present invention will be explained in<br>
detail below using the following examples and test<br>
examples, which should not be construed as limiting the<br>
invention.  In examples, "part" is by weight.<br>
[0022]<br>
Example 1<br>
95.0 parts of TCHO and 5.0 parts of Sipernat<br>
22S were mixed well, and the mixture was pulverized by<br>
a hammer mill to prepare a TCHO premix.  50 parts of<br>
Sipernat 22S and 50 parts of phosphoric acid were mixed<br>
well to prepare a phosphoric acid premix.  93.3 parts<br>
of basic inorganic mineral granular nuclei (silica sand<br>
containing calcium carbonate grains, grain size<br><br>
distribution: 0.5-1.7 mm, pH (10%): 9.5) and 1.5 part<br>
of Moresco White 60 were mixed well by a concrete<br>
mixer, and to the mixture were added 5.0 parts of the<br>
TCHO premix and 0.2 part of the phosphoric acid premix,<br>
followed by mixing for 15 minutes.  The mixture was<br>
screened by a sieve having an opening of 0.5-1.7 mm to<br>
obtain a granular composition containing 4% of TCHO of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0023]<br>
Example 2<br>

Test example (Stability test)<br>
Stability of the granular agricultural<br>
chemical compositions obtained in the above Examples<br>
and Comparative Examples was compared in the following<br>
manner.<br>
50 g of the granular agricultural chemical<br>
composition was put in an aluminum bag, and the bag was<br>
sealed.  The bag was stored in a thermostat of 54°C, and<br>
storage stabilities of the active ingredient after 2<br>
weeks and 4 weeks were examined.  The test results are<br>
shown (Tables 1-3).  The abbreviation "A.I." in the<br>
Table means "active ingredient", and the term "Cartap"<br>
means "cartap hydrochloride".<br>
[0044]<br><br><br><br>
[0045]<br>
As is clear from the results of Tables 1 and<br>
2, TCHO in the granular agricultural chemical<br>
compositions of the present invention was stable<br>
although basic inorganic mineral granular nuclei were<br>
used as extenders.  Even when the content of calcium<br>
carbonate as inorganic mineral granular nuclei was<br>
high, the agricultural chemical active ingredient in<br>
the granular compositions was stable.  As is clear from<br>
Table 3, when phosphoric acid was not contained<br>
(Comparative Example 1), stability of TCHO was damaged.<br>
Furthermore, when PEG-400 which was water-soluble<br>
liquid was used as an adhesive in place of the<br>
oleophilic liquid (liquid paraffin) (Comparative<br>
Examples 2 and 3), decomposition of the agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient was conspicuous regardless<br>
of whether phosphoric acid was added or not.  The<br>
above-mentioned tendency seen in the case of TCHO was<br>
similarly seen in the case of cartap hydrochloride<br>
(Example 12 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5).  When<br>
TCHO and cartap hydrochloride were applied to the<br>
patent relating to stabilization of bensultap<br>
(Comparative Examples 6-9), both the agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredients were conspicuously<br>
decomposed.  Thus, it can be seen that even when basic<br>
inorganic minerals are used or known formulations in<br>
which bensultap is stable are used, TCHO and cartap<br>
hydrochloride which are the same nereistoxins cannot be<br><br>
