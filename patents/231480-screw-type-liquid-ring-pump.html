				<td>Screw type liquid ring pump.<br>
The present invention relates to a screw type liquid ring pump including a pump housing with an inlet and an outlet and an, inside the housing, rotating helical screw rotor, which rotor is connected with a shaft which is commonly provided for the rotor a well as a driving unit in<br>
the form of a motor, preferably an electric motor, whereby the pump with the pump housing represents an elongation of the motor with the motor housing thus representing an integrated or one piece unit.<br>
Liquid ring pumps of the above kind are commonly known where the pump and the driving unit, usually an electric motor, are built together forming one unit. With such solution the production is simplified and the costs are reduced, mainly due to the fact that fewer constructional parts are required such as only one shaft and two shaft bearings, compared to a conventional solution where the pump and rotor are manufactured as two independent units, each with two bearings. The building length of the pump is much shorter with the one piece solution, whereby the pump requires less space and is more effective relative to the size of the pump.<br>
In the applicants own European patent No. 0 454 794 an example is shown of a conventional liquid ring type helical screw pump with a motor, each with its own shaft and own bearings, as well as an integrated solution where a common shaft is used for the pump and motor. With this last mentioned pump solution with a common shaft, the shaft sealing between the pump<br>
and motor is provided in relation to the motor housing, in front of the housing. A disadvantage with this solution is that leakage in the shaft sealing will result in that moisture<br>
enter into the bearing and further into the motor housing, which in the worst case will result hi<br>
* break down of the motor. Another disadvantage is that the sealing arrangement as such and<br>
the connection between the pump and the motor is relatively complicated and causes additional work in connection with the mounting and maintenance of the pump.<br>
With the present invention is provided an improved shaft sealing solution which eliminates or at least essentially reduces the problem with leakage to the motor, which is essentially simpler<br>
to assemble and which provides essentially shorter building length of the total pump and motor solution.<br>
The invention is characterized in that the shaft sealing is provided wholly or partially in an annular space in the rotor, whereby the sealing at one end is resting against an annular part of the screw rotor provided in the annular space between the rotor an the shaft, and at its other end is tightly provided against an inwardly protruding party at the outlet end of the pump, as defined in the attached independent claim 1,<br>
Independent claims 2-4 define preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig 1 shows a screw type liquid ring pump according to the invention; A) seen in vertical cross section and B) seen from above,<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged cross section of a part of the pump shown in Fig. 1 A) in the area around the rotor and the shaft sealing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows as mentioned above a pump and motor solution according to the invention. It includes a driving unit in the form of a motor, preferably an electric motor 2 and a pump unit 20 in the form of a liquid ring screw pump (with helical screw rotor 8) built together as an integrated unit. The pump unit as such further includes an inlet part 3 with an inlet (inlet connection) 15, a screw rotor 8 connected at its forward part with a shaft 7 which is common for the motor and the pump, a rotor housing 9 and an outlet part or pressure chamber part 11 with an outlet (connection part) 19. The outlet part is formed like an intermediate piece between the pump 20 and the motor 2 forming the connection between the two units, whereby the outlet part 19 is connected with the housing for the motor 2 via a screw connection by* means of screws 14.<br>
The main parts of the pump unit 20, i.e. the inlet pail 3, the rotor housing 9 and the outlet part 11 is on the other hand, with an intermediate sealing element (not shown) held together hi a tight connection by means of suitable screws 13.<br>
The pump 20 further includes, in the example shown in the drawhlgs, a grinder 4 with a cutter provided at the outer end of the motor and pump shaft 7 in the inlet part 3 which thus in the<br>
present case is in the form of a grinder housing suitably adapted to the grinder 4. The inlet part or grinder housing 3 is further provided with, by means of screws 18, a removable end plate 5 which provides easy access to the space within the grinder housing to enable cleaning of the grinder and the area therein. The cutter elements of the grinder 4 are replaceable by means of screws 16,17.<br>
The uniqueness of the invention., which is further shown in Fig. 2, is related to the design and provision of the shaft sealing 22,23 being arranged hi an annulus 24 which is formed, by machining by suitable means, in the rotor 8, between the rotor and the shaft 7, whereby the sealing at its inner end, by means of u spring activated (mechanical) sealing element 22 is forced against an annular part 25 in the annulus 24 and at its other end, via a rotatable wearing and sealing ring 23, respectively stationary wearing and sealing ring 26, is kept tightly resting against an inwardly protruding part in the outlet part 11. In the here shown example hi Fig. 2 the inwardly protruding part, due to mounting and production reasons, is formed by a bushing 21 which is connected to the outlet part 11. With mis solution a larger intermediate space is formed between the outlet part 11 (the bushing 21) and the motor housing such that moisture or fluid, if there is a leakage through the sealing 22,23, 25,26, may easily be drained out of the pump. The building length of the pump is further reduced since the sealing is provided hi the annulus of the rotor. Basically the reduction of the building length of the motor and pump unit equals the length of the annulus 24 of the rotor in which the sealing is provided. The fact that the sealing is provided within the rotor also results in that the rotor is not exposed to the liquid or gas that is flowing through the pump which reduces or eliminates corrosion of the rotor, This in turn implies that the rotor may be manufactured of a cheaper material, for instance black iron, which is cheaper than the material of which the other parts and components of the pump is made from. A still further advantage with the present invention is that the pump is made of fewer components, which in turn makes it simpler and cheaper to produce.<br>
It should be noted, even though the example shown in the drawings and described above includes a grinder, that the invention as defined in the claims is not limited to a pump with a grinder, but may as well be used for a pump without a grinder.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A screw type liquid ring pump having a pump housing (9) with an inlet part (3) and an outlet part (11) and an, inside the housing, rotating helical screw rotor (8), said rotor being connected with a shaft (7) commonly being provided for the rotor as well as a driving unit in the form of motor, whereby the pump (20) with the pump housing (9) represents an elongation of the motor (2) with the motor housing, representing an integrated or one piece unit, characterized in that the shaft sealing (22,23) is provided wholly or partially in an annular space (24) provided within the rotor (8), whereby the sealing at its one end is resting against an annular part (25) of the screw rotor provided in the annular space (24) between the rotor and the shaft, and at its other end is tightly provided against an inwardly protruding part (21) at the outlet end of the pump.<br>
