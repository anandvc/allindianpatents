Gas pressure container for gas-powered motor vehicles<br>
The present invention relates to a gas pressure container and its use for filling a further gas pressure container.<br>
Gas-aided motor vehicles form an alternative to conventional vehicles which are powered by petrol or diesel fuel <br>
However,   pressures whiff appropriate storage vessels have to have represent a technical problem here. It is known that the pressure necessary in a storage vessel such as a tank in order to store a sufficient amount of gas car be reduced when an adsorbent is provided in the tank. This adsorbent enables the necessary pressure in the vessel to be reduced for the same amount of gas.<br>
A motor vehicle having such a container comprising an adsorbent is disclosed in JP-A 2002/267096.<br>
However, this does not solve the problem of how such a vehicle is to be filled.<br>
To solve this problem, JP-A 2003/278997 proposes filling a container in a vehicle by direct connection to a town gas line, with a compressor being provided in between.<br>
However, this has the disadvantage of dependence on the presence of a town gas line. In addition, a compressor is required for fuelling and this is associated with production of noise during fuelling of the vehicle. In addition, the adsorbent used is not protected against impurities which may be present as components in the town gas.<br>
There is therefore a need for a gas pressure container which can be, for example, pair of a filling station which allows filling of a motor vehicle in a manner having a simplicity comparable to that prevailing at present for gas-powered vehicles having a pressure container without an adsorbent and in which the assortment is protected against impurities.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide such containers.<br>
The object Is achieved by a gas pressure container having a minimum volume of 1 m^ and<br><br>
a prescribed maximum filling pressure for the uptake, storage and delivery of a fuel gas which is gaseous under storage conditions and is suitable for powering a vehicle by combustion of the fuel gas, wherein the gas pressure container has a filter through which the fuel gas can flow at least during uptake or during delivery, with the filter being suitable for removing possible impurities in the fuel gas from the stream and the impurities being able to reduce the storage capacity for the fuel gas of an adsorbent used for the storage of the fuel gas.<br>
It has been found that it is advantageous to equip the gas pressure container which is to serve for fuelling a vehicle with a filter which protects the adsorbent used for the storage of the fuel gas.<br>
The fuel gas can be a pure gas or a gas mixture and is suitable for powering a vehicle by combustion of the fuel gas. The fuel gas therefore typically comprises at least one of the gases hydrogen or methane. For economic reasons, use is made not of the pure gases but rather gases from natural sources which comprise the pure gases hydrogen and/or methane. These are preferably town gas or natural gas. Very particular preference is given to natural gas.<br>
The fuel gas is gaseous under storage conditions. This means that the fuel gas is present in the gaseous state of matter in the gas pressure container. Accordingly, the fuel gas is in the gaseous state up to a pressure which corresponds to the maximum filling pressure of the gas pressure container. This should be the case for a temperature range up to -20'C.<br>
Furthermore, the gas pressure container has a filter through which the fuel gas can flow at least during uptake or during delivery, with the filter being suitable for removing possible impurities in the fuel gas from the stream and the impurities being able to reduce the storage capacity for the fuel gas of the adsorbent used for storage of the fuel gas.<br>
The task of the filter is thus to protect an adsorbent used against impurities in order to ensure that it has sufficient storage capacity for the fuel gas.<br>
These impurities can be at least one higher hydrocarbon, ammonia or hydrogen sulfide or a mixture of two or more of these substances. Carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide may also be such impurities. In addition, at least one odorous substance can likewise be an impurity. An example of such an odorous substance is tetrahydrothiophene. In addition, numerous gaseous foreign substances by means of which the fuel gas can be<br><br>
contaminated and which can specifically affect the adsorbent in an adverse manner are possible.<br>
Examples of higher hydrocarbons are ethane, propane, butane, and further higher alkanes and also their unsaturated analogues.<br>
The type of impurity depends on the fuel gas used and on the method of producing or extracting it.<br>
These impurities have an adverse effect in that they reduce the storage capacity of the adsorbent for the fuel gas. Such a reduction can, in particular, be due to reversible or irreversible adsorption on the adsorbent. However, it is likewise possible for not only adsorption but also a chemical reaction with the adsorbent to occur so that its storage capacity for the fuel gas is reduced.<br>
The adsorbent used can be present in the gas pressure container of the invention. A further possibility is that the adsorbent used is present in a further gas pressure container which is located in or on a vehicle. Here, the filter can prevent impairment of the storage capacity for the fuel gas of the adsorbent used in the further gas pressure container in or on the vehicle by impurities during filling of this further gas pressure container.<br>
Finally, there is the possibility that an adsorbent can be present both in the gas pressure container according to the invention and in the further gas pressure container, with these adsorbents being able to be identical or different.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "adsorbent" is, in the interests of simplicity, also used for the case when a mixture of a plurality of adsorbents is employed.<br>
Likewise, the tenn "filter" is used in the interests of simplicity for the purposes of the present invention even when a plurality of filters is employed.<br>
The fuel gas can flow through the filter while it is being taken up in the gas pressure container of the invention. As a result, the fuel gas is purified for storage with the aim of later delivery to a vehicle. This is particularly advantageous when an adsorbent is used in the gas pressure container of the invention. In this way. impairment of the storage capacity for the fuel gas of the adsorbent used in the gas pressure container of the invention by impurities can be avoided.<br><br>
The uptake of the fuel gas in the gas pressure container of the invention can be effected by means known from the prior art for the uptake of the fuel gas. It is possible here to use conventional valve technology, with a teed line which leads to the gas pressure containev and which advantageously has at least one valve advantageously being present. The filter can, for example, represent part of the feed line, with further components also being able to be present. In addition, it is also possible for a plurality of feed lines which can correspondingly comprise a plurality of filters or no filters to be present.<br>
In addition, the feed line to the gas pressure container for the uptake of the fuel gas in the gas pressure container can also serve for delivery of the fuel gas. Here, the fuel gas can flow through the filter again. However, it is likewise possible for the feed line which at the same time represents the discharge line to have a bypass which enables the gas to go around the filter. Likewise, further lines which serve for uptake and/or delivery and which have no filter can also be present.<br>
If the uptake of the fuel gas in the gas pressure container of the invention and the delivery from the gas pressure container take place at different points, it is not necessary for the means for taking up the fuel gas in the gas pressure container of the invention to be equipped with the filter. As an alternative, only the means for delivery of the fuel gas can be provided with a filter so that the fuel gas flows through the filter when it is delivered.<br>
The means for delivery can also comprise conventional valve and line technology. These should be dimensioned so that filling of a further pressure container in or on a vehicle takes not more than 3-5 minutes.<br>
Particularly when a further gas pressure container to be filled has an adsorbent, the means for delivery of the fuel gas can additionally comprise means of cooling (for example in the form of at least one feed line and discharge line with cooling liquid). The evolution of heat during filling can in this way be compensated by the heat of adsorption.<br>
It is likewise possible for the means for delivery of the fuel gas to additionally have a suction line which leads expanded fuel gas which has flowed through or around the further gas pressure container for the purpose of cooling back into the gas pressure container according to the invention.<br>
An analogous situation also applies to the means for taking up the fuel gas in the gas pressure container of the invention.<br><br>
A gas pressure container in the case of which the tuel gas flows through the filter only during delivery of the fuel gas is particularly suitable when the gas pressure container has no adsorbent and in addition is to be employed for conventional gas filling of vehicles in which the gas pressure container present in the vehicle has no adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas. Here, the gas pressure container can be used in a duai capacity if means for delivery of the fuel gas which have no filter are present. The conventional delivery of the fuel gas to a gas-powered vehicle known from the prior art is thus possible, with the use of the filter not being necessary here and this therefore preferably being bypassed. If the fuel gas is then to be delivered to a vehicle whose further gas pressure container has an adsorbent for the storage of the fuel gas, the fuel gas can be delivered through the filter so that the adsorbent present in the vehicle is protected against impurities.<br>
Finally, there is also the possibility that the fuel gas flows through the filter both during uptake and during delivery. This can, as indicated above, be achieved by the means for the uptake of the fuel gas in the gas pressure container according to the present invention also serving for delivery of the fuel gas. When the means for the uptake are not simultaneously utilized for delivery, this can be realized by both the means for uptake and the means for delivery having a filter. In such a case, a plurality of separate filters are therefore necessary.<br>
If the gas pressure container does not have an adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas, it is advantageous for the maximum filling pressure to be 300 bar (absolute). This value corresponds approximately to the maximum filling pressure which is, adhered to in conventional filling systems for gas-powered motor vehicles when these do not have an adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas. Since, however, the pressure in a further gas pressure container which is present in or on a vehicle can be smaller when an adsoitent for storage of the fuel gas is present in order to store the same amount of fuel gas, the maximum filling pressure of the gas pressure container according to the invention can also be lower than 300 bar (absolute). The maximum filling pressure for the gas pressure container according to the invention is therefore preferably 200 bar (absolute). However, the maximum filling pressure should be above 100 bar in order to ensure a sufficient pressure drop for delivery of the fuel gas to the further gas pressure container in or on the vehicle. Accordingly, the maximum filling pressure for the further gas pressure container which is located in or on a vehicle is 100 bar (absolute), preferably 80 bar (absolute), i     more preferably 50 bar (absolute). However, this should not be below 10 bar (absolute).<br>
If an adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas is present in the gas pressure container<br><br>
according to the invention, what has been said with regard to the further gas pressure container which is present in or on a vehicle applies to this gas pressure container. Accordingly, the prescribed maximum filling pressure for the gas pressure container according to the invention can also be less than 300 bar (absolute). This is of particular importance because a cheaper construction of the gas pressure container is possible as a result of the lower maximum pressure. The maximum filling pressure of a gas pressure container according to the invention which has an adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas is therefore preferably 150 bar (absolute). The maximum filling pressure is preferably 100 bar (absolute), more preferably 90 bar (absolute). However, it has to be ensured that, jn particular, a pressure drop from the gas pressure container according to the invention to the further gas pressure container in or on a vehicle in the direction of the vehicle is present.<br>
Owing to the lower maximum filling pressure required for a gas pressure container according to the invention when an adsorbent for storage of the fuel gas is present, it is advantageous to regulate the volume flow by means of larger cross sections compared to conventional gas pressure containers for filling gas-powered vehicles in appropriate lines for delivery of the fuel gas so as to ensure a volume flow which is similarly high to the case where a gas pressure container in the high-pressure range (maximum filling pressure 300 bar) is used.<br>
If, for example, the pressure in the gas pressure container according to the invention is 100 bar (instead of 300 bar), the valve for delivery of the fuel gas should, to achieve an approximately equal filling time for the further gas pressure container, have a cross section which is by about a factor of 3 larger.<br>
The gas pressure container of the invention can, as indicated above, have means for uptake and means for delivery of the fuel gas, with a filter being comprised in at least one case. Here, feed lines and/or discharge lines which have such a filter and are additionally equipped with appropriate valves are usually employed. In addition, further components can be present. Reference may here be made, in particular, to sensors which examine the quality of the fuel gas. Such sensors can be present upstream of the filter or downstream thereof. In addition, regulation instrumentation may be provided to close existing valves at appropriately too high an impurities content in order to prevent the storage capacity for the fuel gas of the adsorbent used for storage of the fuel gas from being adversely affected.<br>
Such sensor and regulation technology are known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
The means for uptake of the fuel gas in the gas pressure container of the invention can additionally comprise a compressor which serves for filling the gas pressure container and can build up the necessary pressure,<br>
A person skilled in the art will likewise know how such a filter has to be constructed and the dimensions necessary. The latter depends ultimately on the quality of the fuel gas to be used. The filter can, for example, be in the form of an exchangeable cartridge or be an integral part of a feed and/or discharge line. The impurities are typically bound by adsorption on an appropriate adsorbent in the filter. Here too, appropriate systems are known to those skilled in the art. Suitable adsorbents are metal oxides, molecular sieves, zeolites, activated carbon and the porous metal organic frameworks described in more detail below and also mixtures of these. Combination filters comprising a plurality of different adsorbents which have been optimized for particular Impurities are particularly suitable.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to use one or more filters which comprise different adsorbents for separating off the impurities. The adsorbents used in the filter for separating off the impurities from the fuel gas can, if appropriate, be regenerated after removal from the filter or without being removed. This can be achieved, for example, by heating. There is generally the possibility of removing such impurities by pressure swing adsorption or temperature swing adsorption or combinations thereof.<br>
The filter is typically preceded by a desiccant which removes any moisture (water) present from the fuel gas.<br>
It can be advantageous to provide a plurality of feed lines and/or discharge lines which have a filter, with the uptake and/or delivery of the fuel gas occurring so that at least one line serves for uptake or delivery via a filter and the filter In at least one further line has been regenerated at the same time.<br>
To ensure a sufficient stock of the fuel gas, the gas pressure container of the invention has a minimum volume of 1 m^. The gas pressure container advantageously has a minimum volume of 10 m^, more preferably greater than 100 m^.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "gas pressure container" is in the interests of simplicity also used for the case where a plurality of gas pressure containers connected to one another is used. Thus, the term "gas pressure container" also includes<br><br>
the embodiment in which a plurality of gas pressure containers connected to one another is used.<br>
If a plurality of gas pressure containers connected to one another is used, the minimum volume indicated above is based on the sum of the individual minimum volumes.<br>
If a plurality of gas pressure containers connected to one another is used, the filter can be present on at least one of the gas pressure containers. The filter can likewise be present on a plurality of gas pressure containers.<br>
The gas pressure container of the invention thus sen/es for the uptake, storage and delivery of a fuel gas which is suitable for powehhg a vehicle by combustion of the fuel gas.<br>
The present invention thus further provides for the use of a gas pressure container according to the invention for filling a further gas pressure container which is present in or on a vehicle and comprises an adsorbent for the storage of the fuel gas.<br>
The vehicle can be, for example, a passenger car or a goods vehicle. The volume of the further gas pressure container which is present in or on the vehicle is in the range from 50 to 500 I.<br>
A filter can likewise be present in the vehicle which has the further gas pressure container with an adsorbent tor the storage oi the fuel gas.<br>
The adsorbent used for the storage of the fuel gas can be activated carbon or a porous metal organic framework.<br>
The storage density for the fuel gas in a gas pressure container having an adsorbent should, at 25°C, be at least 50 g/i, preferably at least 80 g/l, for methane-comprising fuel gases and at least 25 g/l, preferably at least 35 g/l, for hydrogen-comprising fuel gases.<br>
It is advantageous for the activated carbon to be in the form of a shaped body and to have a specific surface area of at least 500 m^/g (Langmuir, Nj, 77 K). The specific surface area is more preferably at least 750 m^/g and very particularly preferably at least 1000 mVg.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the adsorbent for the storage of the fuel gas is a<br><br>

For example, preference is given to one-ring dicarboxylic acids, one-ring tricarboxylic acids, one-ring tetracarboxylic acids, two-ring dicarboxylic acids, two-ring tricarboxylic acids, two-ring tetracarboxylic acids, three-ring dicarboxylic acids, three-ring tricarboxylic acids, three-ring tetracarboxylic acids, four-ring dicarboxylic acids, four-ring tricarboxylic acids and/or four-ring tetracarboxylic acids. Suitable heteroatoms are, for example, N, O, S, B, P, Si, Al, and preferred heteroatoms are N, S and/or O. Suitable substituents here are, inter alia, -OH, a nitre group, an amino group and an alkyl or alkoxy group.<br>
Particularly preferred at least bidentate organic compounds are acetylenedicarboxylic acid (ADC), benzenedicarboxylic acids, naphthalenedicarboxvlic acids, biphenyldicarboxylic<br><br>

In addition to these at least bidentate organic compounds, the MOF can further comprise one or more monodentate IJgands.<br>
Suitable solvents tor preparing the MOF are, inter alia, ethanol, dimethylfonnamide, toluene, methanol, chlorobenzene, diethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, water, hydrogen peroxide, methylamine, aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, N-methylpolidone ether, acetonitrile, benzyl chloride, triethylamine, ethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. Further metal ions, at least bidentate organic compounds and solvents for preparing MOFs are described, inter alia, in US-A 5,648,508 or DE-A 10111 230.<br>
The pore size of the MOF can be controlled by selection of the appropriate ligand and/or the at least bidentate organic compound. It is generally the case that the larger the organic compound, the larger the pore size. The pore size is preferably from 0.2 nm to 30 nm, particularly preferably in the range from 0.3 nm to 3 nm, based on the crystalline material.<br>
However, larger pores whose size distribution can vary also occur in a shaped MOF body. Preference is nevertheless given to more than 50% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 75%, being made up by pores having a pore diameter of up to 1000 mm. However, preference is given to a major part of the pore volume being made up by pores having two diameter ranges. It is therefore preferred for more than 25% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 50% of the total pore volume, to be made up by pores which have a diameter in the range from 100 nm to 800 nm and more than 15% of the total pore volume, in particular more than 25% of the total pore volume, to be made up by pores which have a diameter up to 10 nm. The pore distribution can be determined by<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Particular preference is given to a porous metal organic framework in which Zn, Al or Cu are present as metal ion and the at least bidentate organic compound is terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxyljc acid or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxyiic acid.<br>
Apart from the conventional method of preparing MOFs, as described, for example in US 5,648,508, these can also be prepared by an electrochemical route. In this regard, reference may be made to DE-A103 55 087 and WO-A 2005/049892. The MOFs prepared by this route have particularly good properties in respect of the adsorption and desorption of chemical substances, in particular gases. They differ in this way from those prepared in a conventional way even if these are made from the same organic and metal ion constituents and are therefore to be regarded as a new framework. For the purposes of the present invention, electrochemically prepared MOFs are particularly preferred.<br>
Accordingly, the electrochemical preparation relates to a crystalline porous metal organic framework which comprises at least one at least bidentate organic compound coordinated to at least one metal ion and is obtained in a reaction medium comprising the at least one bidentate organic compound by at least one metal ion being produced by oxidation of at least one anode comprising the corresponding metal.<br>
The term "eiectrochemical preparation" refers to a method of preparation in which the formation of at least one reaction product is associated with the migration of electric charges or the occurrence of electric potentials.<br>
The term "at least one metal ion" as is used In connection with the electrochemical preparation refers to embodiments in which at least one ion of a metal or at least one ion of a first metal and at least one ion of al least one second metal which is different from the first metal is provided by anodic oxidation.<br>
Accordingly, the electrochemical preparation comprises embodiments in which at least one ion of at least one metal is provided by anodic oxidation and at least one ion of at least one metal is provided via a metal salt, with the at least one metal in the metal salt and the at least one metal which is provided as metal ion by means of anodic oxidation<br><br>
being able to be identical or different. The present invention therefore comprises with regard to electrochemically prepared MOFs, for example, an embodiment in which the reaction medium comprises one or more different salts of a metal and the metal ion comprised in this salt or in these salts is additionally provided by anodic oxidation of at least one anode comprising this metal. Likewise, the reaction medium can comprise one or more different salts of at least one metal and at least one metal wt^ich is different from these metals can be provided as metal ton by means of anodic oxidation in the reaction medium.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention in connection with the electrochemical preparation, the at least one metal ion is provided by anodic oxidation of at least one anode comprising this at least one metal, with no further metal being provided via a metal salt.<br>
The term "metal" as used for the purposes of the present invention in connection with the electrochemical preparation of MOFs comprises all elements of the Periodic Table which can be provided in a reaction medium by an electrochemical route involving anodic oxidation and are able to forni at least one porous metal organic framework with at least one at least bidentate organic compound.<br>
Regardless of its method of preparation, the MOF is obtained in powder form or as agglomerate. This can be used as such as sorbent in the process of the invention either alone or together with other sorbents or further materials. It is preferably used as loose material, in particular in a fixed bed. Furthermore, the MOF can be converted into a shaped body. Preferred processes here are extrusion or tableting. In the production of shaped bodies, further materials such as binders, lubricants or other additives can be added to the MOF. It is likewise conceivable for mixtures of MOF and other adsorbents, for example activated carbon, to be produced as shaped bodies or separately form shaped bodies which are then used as mixtures of shaped bodies. The possible geometries of these shaped MOF bodies are subject to essentially no restrictions. Examples are, inter alia, pellets such as circular pellets, pills, spheres, granules, exlrudates such as rods, honeycombs, grids or hollow bodies.<br>
To produce these shaped bodies, all suitable processes are possible in principle. The following procedures are particularly preferred:<br>
kneading of the framework either alone or together with at least one binder and/or at<br><br>
least one pasting agent and/or at least one template compound to give a mixture; shaping of the resulting mixture by means of at least one suitable method such as extrusion; optional washing and/or drying and^or calcination of the extrudate; optional finishing treatment.<br>
Application of the framework to at least one porous or nonporous support material. The material obtained can then be processed further to produce a shaped body by the above-described method.<br>
Application of the framework to at least one porous or nonporous substrate.<br>
Foaming into porous polymers such as polyurethane.<br>
Kneading and sfiaping can be carried out by any suitable method, as described, for example, in Ullmann's Enzyklopadie der Technischen Chemie 4, 4th edition, volume 2, p. 313 ff. (1972), whose relevant contents are hereby fully incorporated by reference into the present patent application.<br>
Kneading and/or shaping can, for example, preferably being carried out by means of a piston press, roller press in the presence or absence of at least one binder material, compounding, palletization, tableting, extrusion, coextrusion, foaming, spinning, coating, granulation, preferably spray granulation, spraying, spray drying or a combination of two or more of these methods.<br>
Very particular preference is given to producing pellets, extrudates and/or tablets.<br>
The l^neading and/or shaping can be carried out at elevated temperatures, for example in the range from room temperature to 300'C, and/or at superatmospheric pressure, for example in the range from atmospheric pressure to a few hundred bar, and/or in a protective gas atmosphere, for example in the presence of at least one noble gas, nitrogen or a mixture of two or more thereof.<br>
The kneading and/or shaping is, in a further embodiment, carried out with addition of at least one binder which can In principle be any chemical compound which ensures a viscosity of the composition to be kneaded and/or shaped which is desired for kneading and/or shaping. Accordingly, binders can, for the purposes of the present invention, be either viscosity-increasing or viscosity-reducing compounds.<br><br>
Preferred binders are, for example, aluminum oxide or binders comprising aluminum<br>
oxide, as described, for example, in WO 94/29408, silicon dioxide, as described, for<br>
example, in EP 0 592 050 A1, mixtures of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide, as<br>
described, for example, in WO 94/13584, clay minerals as described, for example, in<br>
JP 03-037156 A, for example montmorillonite, kaolin, bentonite, hallosite, dickite, nacrite<br>
and anauxite, alkoxysilanes as described, for example, in EP 0 102 544 B1, for example<br>
tetraalkoxysilanes such as tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetrapropoxysilane,<br>
tetrabutoxysilane, or, for example, trial koxysilanes such as trimethoxysilane,<br>
triethoxysilane, tripropoxysilane, tributoxysilane, alkoxytitanates, for example<br>
tetraalkoxytitanates	such	as	tetramethoxytitanate,	tetraethoxytitanate,<br>
tetrapropoxytitanate, tributoxytitanate, or, for example, trialkoxytitanates, such as trimethoxytitanate, triethoxytitanate, tripropoxytitanate, tributoxytitanate, alkoxyzirconates, tor example tetraoxyzirconates such as tetramethoxyzirconate, tetraethoxyzirconate, tetrapropoxyzirconate, tetrabutoxyzirconate, or, for example, trialkoxyzirconates such as trimethoxyzirconate, triethoxyzirconate, tripropoxyziroonate, trtbutoxyzirconate, silica sols, amphiphilic substances and/or graphite. Particular preference is given to graphite.<br>
As viscosity-increasing compound, it is possible to use, if appropriate in addition to the abovementioned compounds, for example, an organic compound and/or a hydrophilic polymer such as cellulose or a cellulose derivative such as methyicellulose and/or a polyacrylate and/or a polymethacrylate and/or a polyvinyl alcohol and/or a polyvinyl pyrrolidone and/or a polyisobutene and/or a polytetrahydrofuran.<br>
As pasting agent, it is possible to use, inter alia, preferably water or at least one alcohol such as a monoalcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example methanol, ethanoi, n-propanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propano! or 2-methyl-2-propanol or a mixture of water and at least one of the alcohols mentioned or a polyhydric aJcoho! such as a glycol, preferably a water-miscible polyhydric alcohol, either alone or in admixture with water and/or at least one of the monohydrlc alcohols mentioned.<br>
Further additives which can be used for kneading and/or shaping are, inter alia, amines or amine derivatives such as tetraalkylammonium compounds or amino alcohols and carbonate-comprising compounds, e.g. calcium carbonate. Such further additives are described, for instance, in EP 0 389 041 A1, EP 0 200 260 A1 or WO 95/19222.<br>
The order of addition of the additives such as template compound, binder, pasting agent, viscosity-increasing substance in shaping and kneading is in principle not critical.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the stiaped body obtained after kneading and/or shaping is subjected to at least one drying step which is generally earned out at a temperature in the range from 25 to 300°C, preferably in the range from 50 to 300°C and particularly preferabiy in the range from 100 to 3O0'C. It is likewise possible to carry out drying under reduced pressure or under a protective gas atmosptiere or by spray drying.<br>
