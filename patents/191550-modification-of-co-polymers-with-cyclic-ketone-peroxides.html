The present invention relates to a process for the modification of (co)polymers which employs cyclic ketone peroxides and to the use of these cyclic ketone peroxides for the modification of (co)polymers.<br><br>
Several processes for the modification of (co)polymers with peroxides are known from the prior art. In many of these processes, unsaturated peroxides are employed. Some examples of these processes can be found in EP-A-0322945 and WO 94/05707.<br>
In addition, Canadian Patent 999,698 teaches that methylethyl ketone peroxides can be used to reduce the viscosity of a-olefinic polymers. Further, EP-A-0-497590 and EP-A-0264156 are examples of patents which ' suggest the use of methylethyl ketone peroxide and methylisobutyl ketone peroxide for increasing the melt flow index of polypropylene.<br>
Methylethyl ketone peroxide and methylisobutyl ketone peroxide are known to be mixtures of several different ketone peroxide compounds, among which the noncyclic ketone peroxides predominate. However, these ketone peroxides do contain some small quantities of cyclic ketone peroxides which result from side reactions during the preparation of the methylethyl and methylisobutyl ketone peroxjdes. For example, in commercially available methylethyl ketone peroxides about 1-4% of the total active oxygen content is attributable to cyclic ketone peroxides.<br>
Although these peroxides are known for use in the modification of polymers, their performance in, for example, polypropylene degradation<br><br>
is disappointing and they often cause yellowing of the polymer. Thus, while these peroxides increase the melt flow index of polypropylene, they are not nearly as effective as commercial products such as 2,5-bis(tertiarybutylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl hexane in this application. The present peroxides offer a performance which is comparable to that of the commercially available peroxides and offer the further advantage that less uridesirable by-products are generated by side reactions of the peroxides during their decomposition.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for peroxides which provide an acceptable price/performance ratio in polymer modification. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the summary and detailed description of the present invention which follow.<br>
SUMMARY -Of Jti£-J-RV-ENTi^<br>
In a first aspect, the prestnL invenLion re'idies to a process for the modification of (co)polymers employing an organic peroxide. The process comprises the step of contacting a (co)polymer with organic peroxide under conditions whereby at least some of said organic peroxide is decomposed. The process is further characterized in that at least 20% of the total active oxygen content of the organic peroxide is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected from peroxides represented by the formulae I-III:<br><br><br>
wherein Ri-Rio are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, C5-C20 aryl, C7-C20 aralkyi and C7-C20 alkaryl, which groups may include linear or branched alkyl moieties; and each of Ri-Rio "lay be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from hydroxy, C1-C20 alkoxy, linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl, C5-C20 aryloxy, halogen, ester, carboxy, nitrile, and amido.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention also relates to the use of ., an organic peroxide wherein at least 20% of the total active oxygen content is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected from peroxides represented by the formulae I-III; to modify (co)polymers.<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 87/06944 discloses the use of 3,6,6,9,9-pentamethyl-3-n-propyl-l,2,4,5-tetraoxy cyclononane to modify polypropylene and increase its melt flow index. A similar disclosure is found in U.S. Patent 4,451,589. However, these publications do not teach or suggest the use of the present organic peroxides of the formulae I-III for the modification of (co)polymers.<br>
It has been unexpectedly found that the peroxides of the formulae I-III provide a performance in polymer modification processes which is<br><br>
comparable to the performance of commercially available peroxides for this application and that they provide a performance which is superior to their non-cyclic dialkyl ketone peroxide counterparts.<br>
DETAJ-L€I)-a£SCfiIPJK)NJ}F-4--HE--4NY€44-TJ^<br>
The peroxides of the formulae I-111 can be made by reacting a ketone with hydrogen peroxide as is described in U.S. Patent 3,003,000; Uhlmann, 3rd Edition, Vol. 13, pp. 256-57 (1962); the article, "Studies in Organic Peroxides. XXV. Preparation, Separation and Identification of Peroxides Derived from Methyl Ethyl Ketone and Hydrogen Peroxide," Milas, N.A. and Golubovic, A., J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 81, pp. 5824-26 (1959), Organic Peroxides, Swern, D. editor. Wiley-Interscience, New York (1970) and Houben-Weyl Methoden der Organische Chemie, E13, Volume 1, page 736, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable ketones for use in the synthesis of the present peroxides include, for example, acetone, acetophenone, methyl-n-amyl ketone, ethylbutyl  ketone,  ethylpropyl  ketone,  methylisoamyl 'ketone, methylheptyl ketone, methylhexyl ketone, ethylamyl ketone, diethyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methylisopropyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl-n-butyl ketone, methyl-t-butyl ketone, isobutylheptyl  ketone, diisobutyl  ketone, 2^4-pentanedione, 2,4-hexanedione, 2,4-heptanedione, 3,5-heptanedione, 3,5-octanedione, 5-methyl-2,4-hexanedione, 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-heptanedione, 2,4-octanedione, 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexanedione, 6-methyl-2,4-heptanedione, 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione, 1-phenyl-1,3-pentanedione, l,3-diphenyl-l,3-propanedione, l-phenyl-2,4-pentanedione, methyl benzyl ketone, phenylmethyl ketone, phenyl ethyl ketone, methylchloromethyl ketone, methylbromomethyl ketone and coupling products thereof. Preferred peroxides of the formulae I-III are those in which Ri-Rio are  independently selected from C1-C12 alkyl groups. Of course, other<br><br>
ketones having the appropriate R groups corresponding to the peroxides of the formulae I-III can be employed, as well as mixtures of two or more different ketones.<br>
Examples of preferred peroxides of the formulae I-III for use in accordance with the present invention are the cyclic ketone peroxides derived from acetone, methylamyl ketone, methylheptyl ketone, methylhexyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methylethyl ketone, mehtyloctyl ketone, methylnonyl ketone, methyldecyl ketone, methylundecyl ketone, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Cyclic ketone peroxides are composed of at least two ketone peroxide entities which may be the same or different. Thus, cyclic ketone peroxides may exist in the form of dimers, trimers, etc. When cyclic ketone peroxides are prepared, usually a mixture is formed which predominantly exists of the dimeric and trimeric forms. The ratio between the various forms mainly depends on the reaction conditions during the preparation. If, desired, th^ mixture may be separated in the individual cyclic ketone peroxide compounds. Generally, the cyclic ketone peroxide trimers are less volatile and more reactive than the corresponding dimers. Preference for certain compositions or individual compounds may depend on differences in physical properties or requirements in application of the peroxides, e.g. storage stability, half-life time vs. temperature, volatility, boiling point, solubility, etc. It is to be understood that any form of the cyclic ketone peroxides, e.g. oligomeric compounds or mixtures, are comprised in the present invention.<br>
The peroxides can be prepared, transported, stored and applied as such or in the form of powders, granules, pellets, pastilles, flakes, slabs, pastes and solutions. These formulations may optionally be phlegmatized, as necessary, depending on the particular peroxide and its concentration in the formulation.<br><br>
Which of these forms is to be preferred partly depends on the ease of feeding the peroxide into closed systems. Also, considerations of safety may play a role to the extent that phlegmatizers may have to be incorporated in certain compositions to ensure their safety. As examples of suitable phlegmatizers may be mentioned solid carrier materials such as polymers, silica, chalk, clay, inert plasticizers, solvents and inert diluents such as silicone oils, white oils and water.<br>
The present cyclic ketone peroxides are exceptionally well suited for use in the modification of polymers. More particularly, these peroxides can be employed in processes such as the degradation of poiyolefins such as polypropylene and copolymers thereof, the crossllnking of poiyolefins such as ethylene/propylene/diene polymers, polyethylene and copolymers thereof, the dynamic crosslinking of blends of elastomers and thermoplastic polymers, the grafting of monomers onto polymers such as polyethers, poiyolefins and elastomers, and the functionalization of poiyolefins in the case of functional group containing cyclic ketone peroxides.<br>
In general, the cyclic ketone peroxide may be brought into contact with the (co)polymer in various ways, depending upon the particular object of the modification process. For example, if surface modification of a three dimensional polymeric object is desired, the cyclic ketone peroxide may be applied to the surface of the material to be modified. Alternatively, if it is desirable to modify the (co)polymer homogeneously throughout the (co)polymeric matrix, then the peroxide may be mixed with the material to be modified, which material may be in the molten state, in the form of a solution, or, in the case of an elastomer, in a plastic state. It is also possible to mix the (co)polymer, in powder form, with the cyclic ketone peroxide.<br>
To accomplish homogeneous mixing of the unmodified (co)polymer with the peroxide, most conventional mixing apparatus may be used.' Typical<br><br>
mixing apparatus includes kneaders, internal mixers and (mixing) extruding equipment. Should mixing be a problem for a particular material because of its high melting point, for example, the (co)polymer can first be modified on its surface while in the solid state and subsequently melted and mixed. Alternatively, the (co)polymer may be first dissolved in a solvent and the reaction with the cyclic ketone peroxide can then be carried out in solution.<br>
An important practical aspect of the present invention is that the moment the cyclic ketone peroxide and the (co)polymer are brought into contact with each other and also the moment that the cyclic ketone peroxide is to react with the (co)polymer can be chosen independently of the other usual polymer processing steps, including the introduction of additives, shaping, etc. For instance, the modification may be done before other additives are introduced into the polymer or after the introduction of other additives. More importantly, it is possible to accomplish the present polymer modification during a polymer shaping step such as extrusion, compression moulding, blow moulding or injection moulding. The present polymer modification process is most preferably carried out in an extrusion apparatus.<br>
The word, "(co)polymer" as used in this application should be interpreted to mean, "polymers and copolymers." The term, "ketone peroxide" as used in this application should be interpreted to include peroxides derived from both ketones and aldehydes.<br>
In general, any (co)polymer comprising abstractable hydrogen atoms can be modified by the present process. The (co)polymer material treated by the process of the present invention may be in any physical form including finely divided particles (flake), pellets, film, sheet, in the melt, in solution and the like. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention the' (co)polymeric material is in the finely divided form suitable for powder modification in a subsjtantially<br><br>
oxygen-free atmosphere, in the melt form suitable for modification in an air-containing atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere, or in a solution in a suitable solvent.<br>
The amount of peroxide used in the modification process of the present invention should be an amount effective to achieve significant modification of the (co)polymer when treating a (co)polymer. More particularly, from 0.001-15.0 weight percent of peroxide, based on the weight of the (co)polymer, should be employed. More preferably, from 0.005-10.0 weight percent is employed. Most preferably, an amount of 0.01-5.0 weight percent is employed.<br>
In order to clearly distinguish the present cyclic ketone peroxides from prior art ketone peroxides which contained some cyclic ketone peroxides as an impurity therein, it is required that at least 20 percent of the total active oxygen content of the peroxide(s) employed in the modification process of the present invention be attributable to one or more ryclic ketone r'=rcxide(s). More preferably, the cyclic ketone peroxides provide at least 50 percent of the total active oxygen content of the composition which is employed in the modification process and most preferably at least 70 percent of the total active oxygen content of the peroxide composition used in the modification process is attributable to the cyclic ketone peroxide(s). • Comparative examples included herein demonstrate the advantages of these cyclic ketone peroxides over their non-cyclic counterparts.<br>
During modification, the (co)polymer may also contain the usual polymer additives. As examples of such additives may be mentioned: stabilizers such as inhibitors of oxidative, thermal or ultraviolet degradation, lubricants, extender oils, pH controlling substances such as calcium carbonate, release agents, colorants, reinforcing or non-reinforcing fillers such as silica, clay, chalk, carbon black and fibrous materials such as glass fibers, nucleating agents, plasticizers, accelerators, and cross-linking agents such as other<br><br>
types of peroxides and sulfur. These additives may be employed in the usual amounts.<br>
It has been found that when certain (co)polymers are contacted with the present cyclic ketone peroxides, degradation of the polymer chains occurs. For instance, polymers which tend to degrade include isotactic polypropylene, atactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, alkylene/propylene copolymers such as ethylene/propylene random and block copolymers, and terpolymers such as alkylene/propylene/butylene terpolymers, e.g., ethyl ene/propylene/butylene terpolymers; propylene/diene monomer copolymers, propylene/styrene copolymers, poly(butene-l), poly(butene-2), polyisobutene, isoprene/isobutylene copolymers, chlorinated isoprene/isobutylene copolymers, poly(methylpentene), polyvinyl alcohol, polystyrene, poly(a-methyl)styrene, 2,6-dimethyl polyphenylene oxide and mixtures or blends of these polymers with one another and/or with other non-degradable polymers.<br>
The treatment of (co)polymers prone to degradation by the process of the present invention generally produces a polymeric material having a net increase in melt flow index and decrease in weight average molecular weight, as well as a narrower molecular weight distribution (dispersity), when compared to the starting, unmodified polymer. In the case of polypropylene and copolymers thereof, most of the mechanical properties of the modified (co)polymers remain unchanged. Further, some properties of specific (co)polymeric products are improved, such as, tenacity of fibers, warpage of injection-molded articles and the transparency of polymer films. The modification process of the present invention is particularly advantageous for various polypropylene processes such as fiber spinning, high speed injection molding and melt-blowing of non-wovens.<br>
Degradation may b^ carried out in the usual manner.  In the presence of one or more of the peroxides of the formulae I-III, the (co)polymer<br><br>
is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the (co)polymer and above the decomposition temperature of the peroxide. Usually, a temperature of 50-350°C, more preferably, 100-300°C, is employed. The heating time is generally between 0.1 and 30 minutes and, more preferably, 0.5-5 minutes. Degradation is most preferably carried out in an extrusion apparatus.<br>
Peroxides containing t-butylperoxide groups, commonly employed in the degradation of polyolefins, release upon reaction t-butanol and acetone as major decomposition products. An advantage of cyclic ketone peroxides such as those derived from methylethyl ketone, methylpropyl ketone, butylmethyl ketone and diethyl ketone, is that they do not give acetone or t-butanol as decomposition products.<br>
The present cyclic ketone peroxides may also be employed in the cross-linking of polymers such as low, linear low, medium and high density polyethylene, ethylene/al kene copolymers, ethylene/propylene/diene monomer terpolymers, chlorosulphonated polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, propylene/diene monomer copolyttiers, brominated isoprene/isobutylene copolymers, partially hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, poly(cyclopentadiene), poly(methylcyclopentadiene), polynorbornene, isoprene/styrene copolymers, butadiene/styrene copolymers, butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, aerylonitrile/butadiene/styrene terpolymers, polyacrylamides, polymethacrylamides, polyurethanes, polysulfides, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, copolyether esters, polyamides, silicone rubbers, fluorrubbers such as polyf 1 uoral koxyphosphazenes•, al lylglycidyl ether/epichlorohydrin copolymers and mixtures or blends thereof.<br>
For carrying out the cross-linking process of the present invention, use may 'be made of conventional cross-linking techniques and equipment.  The process of the present Invention is particularly<br><br>
suitable for the crosslinking of high density polyethylene in rotomolding processes which are generally carried out at high temperatures.<br>
The present invention is also suitable for the dynamic cross-linking of a blend of an elastomer and a thermoplastic (co)polymer. Suitable elastomers for use in the blends to be dynamically cross!inked by the process of the present invention comprise ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, chlorinated polyethylenes, chlorosulphonated polyethylenes, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/propylene/diene monomer terpolymers, butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, natural rubber, polychloroprene, silicone rubbers, fiuorrubbers and mixtures or blends thereof.<br>
Suitable thermoplastic (co)polymers for use in the blends crosslinked by the process of the present invention comprise thermoplastic, crystalline or amorphous (co)polymers. More particularly, said (co)polymer is selected from low, medium and high density polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene,. atactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyamides, polyphenylene oxides, alloys of polyphenylene oxides with polystyrene and mixtures thereof.<br>
The (co)polymer modification process of the present invention is also useful for the grafting of monomers onto polymers or for the production of graft-copolymers. Examples of suitable (co)polymers which according to the present invention can be grafted by means of the cyclic ketone peroxides are copolymers and block copolymers of conjugated 1,3-dienes, and one or more copolymerizable monoethylenically unsaturated monomers such as aromatic monovinylidene hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic monovinylidene hydrocarbons, (meth)acrylonitrile, alkyl (meth)acrylates, acrylamides, unsaturated ketones, vinyl esters, vinyl i'denes and vinyl halides; ethylene/propylene copolymers and ethylene/propylene copolymers with<br><br>
other (poly)unsaturated compounds such as hexadiene-1,4, dicyclopentadiene and 5-ethylidenenorbornene; polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and copolymers thereof; and polyols including polyols which are essentially free of ethylenic unsaturation. Such polyols include polyalkylene polyether polyols having from 2-6 carbon atoms per monomeric unit and an Mn of 400-2000, polyhydroxyl containing polyesters, hydroxy-terminated polyesters and aliphatic polyols.<br>
Suitable monomers for grafting onto the above-mentioned polymers using the cyclic ketone peroxides of the present invention are olefinic or ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as: substituted or unsubstituted vinyl aromatic monomers including styrene and a-methylstyrene; ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof such as (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrylic esters and glycidyl methacrylate; ethylenically unsaturated nitriles and amides such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and acrylamide; substituted or unsubstituted ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as butadiene; vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate; ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and their derivatives including mono- and diesters, anhydrides and imides, such as maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, nadic anhydride, maleic acid, aryl, alkyl and aralkyl citraconimides and maleimides; vinyl halogenides such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride; olefins such as isobutene and 4-methylpentene; and epoxides.<br>
In the grafting process, the ratio of the polymer to the grafting monomer is from 99:1 to 1:50. Again, the conventional grafting processes, conditions and apparatus may be employed to achieve grafting with the peroxides of the formulae I-III of the present invention.<br>
Finally, the modification process of the present invention can be employed to introduce functional' groups into (co)polymers. This may<br><br>
be accomplished by employing a peroxide of the formulae I-III which contains one or more functional "R" groups attached thereto. These functional groups will remain intact in the free radicals formed by the cyclic ketone peroxides and thus are introduced into the modified (co)polymer. Conventional polymer modification conditions and apparatus may be used to achieve this object of the present invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the modification process is conducted in the presence of a coagent in order to control the amount of polymer degradation or enhance the degree of modification (i.e. crosslinking or functional group introduction) in the (co)polymer.<br>
A coagent is generally understood to be a polyfunctional reactive additive such as a polyunsaturated compound which will react rapidly with polymer radicals, will overcome steric hindrance effects and will minimize undesirable side reactions. Further information about coagents (which are sometimes called coactivators) is set forth in Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Vol. 61, pp. 238-254 and W. Hofmann, Progress in Rubber and Plastics Technology, Vol. 1, No. 2, March 1985, pp. 18-50, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In relation to the present invention the term "coagent" has the same meaning as is given in these publications.<br>
A wide variety of useful coagents are commercially available including di- and triallyl compounds, di-and tri(meth)acrylate compounds, bismaleimide compounds, divinyl compounds such as divinyl benzene, vinyl toluene, vinyl pyridine, polyalkenylbenzenes and their polymers, polybutadiene, parachinone dioxime, 1,2-cis-polybutadiene and derivatives of these compounds. Furthermore, other useful coagents include oligomers of 1,3-diisopropenyl benzene, 1,4-diisopropenyl benzene, and 1,3,5-triisopropenyl benzene.<br><br>
The incorporation of an effective amount of one or more of these coagents into the (co)polymer prior to, or during the reaction with the present cyclic ketone peroxides will tend to reduce the amount degradation of the modified materials. In this manner, the degree o^ degradation can be adjusted, if desired. Suprisingly, in some cases the coagent may result in improved mechanical properties such as an enhanced adhesion strength in modified (co)polymers of a polar nature. This enhancement may be attributable to a greater degree of functional group introduction into the (co)polymer resulting from the presence of a coagent.<br>
Finally, in another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of an organic peroxide wherein 20% of the total active oxygen content is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected from peroxides represented by the formulae I-III; to modify (co)polymers. The modification conditions and apparatus are the same as those disclosed above with respect to the (co)polymer modification processes.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the modification such as degradation, o-oss-linking and grafting of a (co)polym^, comprising the step of contacting said (co)pol&gt;iner with an organic peroxide, qjtionally in the presence of a coagent, under the conditions whereby at least some of said organic peroxide is decomposed, charactmzed in that at least 20% of the total active oxygen contact of the oi^anic peroxide is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected fix»n peroxides rq&gt;resented by the formulae 1-111;<br><br>
wherein Ri-Rio are indq)endently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, C^-Oio aryl C7-C20 araJkyl and C7-C20 alkaryl, whidi groups may include linear or brandied alkyl moieties; and each of Rr Rio may be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected frmn hydroxy, Ci-C20 aUcoxy, linear or branched Ci-Cjo alkyl, C,y-C2o aryloxy, halogen, estw, carboxy, nitrile, and amido and recovering the modified (co)polymer fit&gt;m the reaction stream in a known manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The total active oxygen content was measured by placing 50 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 250 ml round-bottomed 'flask fitted with a ground" glass joint, an inlet tube for nitrogen gas, a heating mantle<br><br>
and a 70 cm. long air condensor. Nitrogen gas was then passed over the liquid with heating until the liquid boiled. After 2 minutes of boiling, 5 ml of 770 g/1 potassium iodide solution was added and a sample containing approximately 2 meq of active oxygen was added to the reaction mixture with mixing. The air condensor was then connected and the contents of the flask were heated rapidly to boiling and maintained at moderate boiling for 30 minutes. 50 ml of water was then added through the condensor and the condensor was removed from the flask. The reaction mixture was then immediately titrated with a 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution until the yellow color disappeared. A blank should be run alongside this titration.<br>
The total active oxygen may then by calculated by subtracting the volume of sodium thiosulphate solution used in the blank from the amount used in the titration, multiplying this figure by the normality of the sodium thiosulphate solution and then by 800, and finally dividing by the mass of the peroxide sample in milligrams.<br>
The active oxygen content of the non-cyclic peroxides used was measured by placing 20 ml" of glacial acetic acid in a 200 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a ground glass joint and an inlet tube for nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas was then passed over the surface of the liquid. • After 2 minutes, 4 ml of 770 g/1 potassium iodide solution was added and a sample containing approximately 1.5 meq of active oxygen was added to the reaction mixture with mixing. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for at least 1 minute at 25°C ± 5°C. The reaction mixture was then titrated with a 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution to colorless end point adding 3 ml of 5 g/1 starch solution towards the end of the titration. A blank should be run alongside this titration.<br>

In these examples, Moplen® FLS20 was premixed with 0.1 weight percent of Irganox® 1010 antioxidant and the amounts of the peroxides mentioned in Table 1 to give an active oxygen concentration of 0.011%. The peroxides were all diluted in isododecane as phlegmatizer. The mixing was performed in a cubic mixer for a period of 15 minutes.<br>

In fact, the present cyclic ketone peroxides are shown to be comparable to the commercial product, Trigonox® 101, which is currently employed in polypropylene degradation.

From Table 2 it can be seen that increasing concentrations of cyclic ketone peroxides result in increasing levels of polypropylene degradation.

From Table 3 it can be seen that the higher the modification temperature, the greater the degree of polypropylene degradation. This demonstrates that the process of the present invention is effective over a wide temperature range and that the degree of polymer degradation can be controlled, to an extent, by varying the modification temperature. Further, it is shown that the non-cyclic ketone peroxides {MEKP-T3, Butanox® LPT and Trigonox® 233) are far less effective in polypropylene degradation than the cyclic ketone peroxides of the present invention.<br><br>
