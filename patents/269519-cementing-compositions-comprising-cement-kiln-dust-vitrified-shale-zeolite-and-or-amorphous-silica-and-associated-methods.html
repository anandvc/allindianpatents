				<td>CEMENTING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING CEMENT KELN DUST,<br>
VITRIFIED SHALE, ZEOLITE, AND/OR AMORPHOUS SILICA UTILIZING A<br>
PACKING VOLUME FRACTION, AND ASSOCIATED METHODS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to cementing operations and, more particularly, to the use of cementing compositions comprising water, cement kiln dust ("CKD"), vitrified shale, zeolite, and/or amorphous silica, that are prepared by utilizing a packing volume fraction, and associated methods of use.<br>
Cementing compositions are commonly utilized in a variety of subterranean operations. Subterranean applications that may involve cementing compositions include, but are not limited to, primary cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. For example, cement compositions are used in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings such as casings and liners are cemented in well bores. In performing primary cementing, cement compositions are pumped into the annular space between the walls of a well bore and the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened substantially impermeable cement therein that substantially supports and positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surface of the pipe string to the walls of the well bore. Cement compositions are also used in plugging and abandonment operations as well as in remedial cementing operations such as plugging permeable zones or fractures in well bores, plugging cracks and holes in pipe strings, and the like. Cementing compositions also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing.<br>
Cementing compositions used heretofore commonly comprise Portland cement. Portland cement generally is a major component of the cost for the cementing compositions. To reduce the cost of such cementing compositions, other solid particulate components may be included in the cementing composition in addition to, or in place of, the Portland cement The resulting combination of multiple solid particulate materials in the cementing compositions can result in a "settling effect," in which different sized particulate materials will settle separately at different speeds. This settling of the solids in a cement composition may result in defective cementing procedures and failure of the set cement to provide zonal isolation. Thus, among other things, there are needs for an improved<br>
cementing composition for well cements which can be utilized without resulting in settling of solid particulates.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention relates to cementing operations and, more particularly, to cementing compositions comprising water, CKD, vitrified shale, zeolite, and/or amorphous silica, that are prepared by utilizing a packing volume fraction, and associated methods of use.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to cementing operations and, more particularly, to cementing compositions comprising water, CKD, vitrified shale, zeolite, and/or amorphous silica, that are prepared by utilizing a packing volume fraction, and associated<br>
methods of use. The cementing compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of subterranean applications, including primary cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. The cementing compositions of the present invention also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing.<br>
In some embodiments, cementing compositions of the present invention comprise water, CKD, vitrified shale, zeolite, and/or amorphous silica, that utilize a packing volume fraction. Optional additives also may be included in the cementing compositions of the present invention as desired, including, but not limited to, hydraulic cement, other materials such as silica, hematite or other iron oxide, barium hydroxide, carbonates, alumina etc., and organic products such as plastic wastes and other compatible wastes. The cementing composition may further include set retarding additives, set accelerating additives, dispersing agents, fluid loss control additives, lightweight additives, and the like.<br>
The cementing compositions of the present invention should utilize a packing volume fraction suitable for a particular application as desired. As used herein, the term "packing volume fraction" refers to the volume of the solid particulate materials in a fluid divided by the total volume of the fluid. The size ranges of the preferred solid particulate materials are selected, as well as their respective proportions, in order to provide a maximum (or close as possible to maximum) packing volume fraction so that the fluid is in a hindered settling state. It is known that, in such a state, the solid particulate materials behave "collectively" like a porous solid material. The hindered settling state is believed to correspond, in practice, to a much higher solid material concentration in the fluid than that present in the prior art.<br>
The present invention consists of the combination of at least three features to obtain a maximum packing volume fraction. One is the use of at least three particulate materials wherein the at least three particulate materials are in size ranges "disjointed" from one another. Another feature of the present invention is the choice of the proportions of the three particulate materials in relation to the mixing, such that the fluid, when mixed, is in a hindered settling state. Another feature is the choice of the proportions of the three particulate materials between each other, and according to their respective size ranges, such that the maximum packing volume fraction is at least substantially achieved for the sum total of all particulate materials in the fluid system. Packing volume fraction is described in<br>
further detail in United States Patent No. 5,518,996, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The present invention employs the use of at least three particulate materials comprising CKD, vitrified shale, zeolite, and/or amorphous silica. The sizes of these materials may be "ultra fine," "very fine," "fine," "small," "medium," "large," and "very large" particulate materials. "Ultra fine" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 7 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. "Very fine" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 0.05 microns to about 0.5 microns. "Fine" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 0.5 microns to about 10 microns. "Small" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 10 microns to about 20 microns. "Medium" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 20 microns to about 200 microns. "Large" particulate materials may be present with a size in the range of from about 200 microns to about 800 microns. "Very large" particulate materials may be present with a size greater than about 1 millimeters. As recognized by one skilled in the art, the proportion of particulates chosen in the composition depend on the end use. In any event, the particulates and the relative sizes and concentrations in a given composition should be chosen based on a maximum packing volume fraction as disclosed hereia<br>
In certain embodiments, the cementing compositions of the present invention may contprise CKD, a waste material generated during the manufacture of cement. CKD, as that term is used herein, refers to a partially calcined kiln feed that is removed from the gas stream and collected in a dust collector during the manufacture of cement. The chemical analysis of CKD from various cement manufactures varies depending on a number of factors, including the particular kiln feed, the efficiencies of the cement production operation, and the associated dust collection systems. CKD generally may comprise a variety of oxides, such as SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SO3, Na2O, and K2O. In some embodiments, the CKD may be present as fine particulate materials. In other embodiments, the CKD may be present as small particulate materials. In other embodiments, the CKD may be present as medium particulate materials. In other embodiments, the CKD may be present as large particulate materials. In certain embodiments, the CKD may be present in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 25% to about 75% by weight of composition ("bwoc") therein.<br>
In certain embodiments, the cementing compositions of the present invention may comprise vitrified shale in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength, density, and/or cost. A variety of shales are suitable, including those comprising silicon, aluminum, calcium, and/or magnesium. Suitable examples of vitrified shale include, but are not limited to, 'TRESSUR-SEAL® FINE LCM" material and "PRESSUR-SEAL® COARSE LCM" material, which are commercially available from TXI Energy Services, Inc., Houston, Texas. In certain embodiments, the vitrified shale may be present as large particulate materials. In other embodiments, the vitrified shale may be present as very large particulate materials. In certain embodiments, the vitrified shale may be present in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 30% bwoc therein. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the appropriate amount of the shale to include for a chosen application.<br>
In certain embodiments, the cementing compositions of the present invention may comprise zeolite.   Zeolite may be used in conjunction with vitrified shale in some embodiments.  In other embodiments, zeolite may be an alternative to vitrified shale.  The choice may be dictated by a number of factors, such as total extent of compressive strength of the cement, time for cement composition to develop compressive strength, and density of the composition. Zeolites generally are porous alumino-silicate minerals that may be either a natural or synthetic material.  Synthetic zeolites are based on the same type of structural cell as natural zeolites, and may comprise aluminosilicate hydrates. As used herein, the term "zeolite" refers to all natural and synthetic forms of zeolite.   In certain embodiments, the zeolite may be present as fine particulate materials. In other embodiments, the zeolite may be present as small particulate materials.  In other embodiments, the zeolite may be present as medium particulate materials. In other embodiments, the zeolite may be present as large particulate materials.  In certain embodiments, the zeolite may be present in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 25% bwoc therein.<br>
In certain embodiments, suitable zeolites for use in present invention may include "analcime" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "bikitaite" (which is lithium aluminum silicate), "brewsterite" (which is hydrated strontium barium calcium aluminum silicate), "chabazite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate),<br>
"clinoptilolite" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "faujasite" (which is hydrated sodium potassium calcium magnesium aluminum silicate), "harmotome" (which is hydrated barium aluminum silicate), "heulandite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "laumontite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "mesolite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "natrolite" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "paulingite" (which is hydrated potassium sodium calcium barium aluminum silicate), "phillipsite" (which is hydrated potassium sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "scolecite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "stellerite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "stilbite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), and "thomsonite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, suitable zeolites for use in the present invention include chabazite and clinoptilolite. An example of a suitable source of zeolite is available from the C2C Zeolite Corporation of Calgary, Canada.<br>
In certain embodiments, the cementing compositions of the present invention may comprise amorphous silica. Amorphous silica is generally a byproduct of a ferrosilicon production process, wherein the amorphous silica may be formed by oxidation and condensation of gaseous silicon suboxide, SiO, which is formed as an intermediate during the process. An example of a suitable source of amorphous silica is commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., Duncan, Oklahoma, under the trade name "SILICALITE." In certain embodiments, the amorphous silica may be present as very fine particulate materials. In other embodiments, the amorphous silica may be present as fine paniculate materials. In other embodiments, the amorphous silica may be present as small particulate materials. In other embodiments, the amorphous silica may be present as medium particulate materials. In certain embodiments, the amorphous silica may be present in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 5% to about 40% bwoc therein.<br>
The water used in the cementing compositions of the present invention may include freshwater, saltwater (e.g., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated saltwater produced from subterranean formations), seawater, or combinations thereof. Generally, the water may be from any source, provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds that may adversely affect other components in the cementing composition. In some embodiments, the water may be included in an amount<br>
sufficient to form a pumpable slurry. In some embodiments, the water may be included in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 40% to about 200% by weight. As used herein, the term "by weight," when used herein to refer to the percent of a component in the cementing composition, means by weight included in the cementing compositions of the present invention relative to the weight of the dry components in the cementing composition. In some embodiments, the water may be included in an amount in the range of from about 40% to about 150% by weight.<br>
The cementing compositions of the present invention may optionally comprise a hydraulic cement. A variety of hydraulic cements may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, including, but not limited to, those comprising calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, iron, and/or sulfur, which set and harden by reaction with water. Suitable hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to, Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, high alumina content cements, slag cements, silica cements, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydraulic cement may comprise a Portland cement In some embodiments, the Portland cements that are suited for use in the present invention are classified as Classes A, C, H, and G cements according to American Petroleum Institute, API Specification for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed., July 1, 1990. In certain embodiments, the cement may be present in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 20% to about 50% bwoc therein<br>
In certain embodiments, the cementing compositions of the present invention further may comprise a set retarding additive. As used herein, the term "set retarding additive" refers to an additive that retards the setting of the cementing compositions of the present invention. Examples of suitable set retarding additives include, but are not limited to, ammonium, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, metal salts of sulfoalkylated lignins, hydroxycarboxy acids, copolymers that comprise acrylic acid or maleic acid, and combinations thereof. One example of a suitable sulfoalkylate lignin comprises a sulfomethylated lignin. Suitable set retarding additives are disclosed in more detail in United States Patent No. Re. 31,190, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable set retarding additives are commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. in Duncan, Oklahoma, under the tradenames "HR® 4," "HR® 5," HR® 7," "HR® 12," "HR'®15," HR* 25," "SCR™ 100," and "SCR™ 500." Generally, where<br>
used, the set retarding additive may be included in the cementing compositions of the present invention in an amount sufficient to provide the desired set retardation. In some embodiments, the set retarding additive may be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight.<br>
Optionally, other additional additives may be added to the cementing compositions of the present invention as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure. Examples of such additives include, but are not limited to, accelerators, weight reducing additives, heavyweight additives, lost circulation materials, filtration control additives, dispersants, and combinations thereof. Suitable examples of these additives include crystalline silica compounds, amorphous silica, salts, fibers, hydratable clays, microspheres, pozzolan lime, latex cement, thixotropic additives, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
An example of a cementing composition of the present invention may comprise water, cement, CKD, amorphous silica, and vitrified shale. Another example of a cementing composition of the present invention may comprise water, cement, CKD, amorphous silica, zeolite, and vitrified shale. As desired by one of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, such cementing composition of the present invention further may comprise any of the above-listed additives, as well any of a variety of other additives suitable for use in subterranean applications.<br>
The cementing compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of subterranean applications, including, but not limited to, primary, cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. The cementing compositions of the present invention also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing.<br>
An example of a method of the present invention comprises providing a cementing composition of the present invention comprising water and paniculate materials in a hindered settling state; placing the cementing composition in a location to be cemented; and allowing the cementing composition to set therein. In some embodiments, the location to be cemented may be above ground, for example, in construction cementing. In some embodiments, the location to be cemented may be in a subterranean formation, for example, in subterranean applications. As desired by one of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, the cementing compositions of the present invention useful in this method<br>
further may comprise any of the above-listed additives, as well any of a variety of other additives suitable for use in subterranean applications.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as defined by the appended claims.
