				<td>METHOD OF PRODUCING UNSATURATED ACID IN FIXED-BED<br>
CATALYTIC PARTIAL OXIDATION REACTOR WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or unsaturated acids<br>
from olefins or alkanes in a fixed bed shell-and-tube heat<br>
exchanger-type reactor by catalytic vapor phase oxidation,<br>
as well as a heat exchanger-type reactor for use in the<br>
same process.<br>
Background Art<br>
A process for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated acids from olefins or alkanes in vapor phase<br>
by using a catalyst is a typical process of catalytic<br>
vapor phase oxidation.<br>
Particular examples of such catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation include a process for producing acrolein and/or<br>
acrylic acid by the oxidation of propylene or propane, or<br>
a process for producing methacrolein and/or methacrylic<br>
acid by the oxidation of isobutylene, isobutane, t-butyl<br>
alcohol or methyl t-butyl ether.<br>
Generally, catalytic vapor phase oxidation is<br>
carried out by charging one or more kinds of granular<br>
catalysts into a reaction tube (catalytic tube), supplying<br>
feed gas into a reactor through a pipe, and contacting the<br>
feed gas with the catalyst in the reaction tube. Reaction<br>
heat generated during the reaction is removed by heat<br>
exchange with a heat transfer medium whose temperature is<br>
maintained at a predetermined temperature. The heat<br>
transfer medium for heat exchange is provided on the outer<br>
surface of the reaction tube so as to perform heat<br>
transfer. The reaction mixture containing a desired<br>
1<br><br>
product is collected and recovered through a pipe, and<br>
sent to a purification step. Since the catalytic vapor<br>
phase oxidation is a highly exothermic reaction, it is<br>
very important to maintain reaction temperature within a<br>
certain range and to reduce the magnitude of a hot spot<br>
occurring in a reaction zone. It is also very important to<br>
disperse heat at a site where heat accumulation may occur<br>
due to the structure of a reactor or a catalyst layer.<br>
The partial oxidation of olefins or alkanes<br>
corresponding thereto uses a multimetal oxide containing<br>
molybdenum and bismuth or vanadium or a mixture thereof,<br>
as a catalyst.<br>
Generally, (meth)acrylic acid, a final product, is<br>
produced from propylene, propane, isobutylene, isobutane,<br>
t-butyl alcohol or methyl-t-butyl ether (referred to as<br>
'propylene or the like' , hereinafter) by a two-step<br>
process of vapor phase catalytic partial oxidation. More<br>
particularly, in the first step, propylene or the like is<br>
oxidized by oxygen, inert gas for dilution, water steam<br>
and a certain amount of a catalyst, so as to produce<br>
(meth)acrolein as a main product. Then, in the second step,<br>
the (meth) acrolein is oxidized by oxygen, inert gas for<br>
dilution, water steam and a certain amount of a catalyst,<br>
so as to produce (meth)acrylic acid. The catalyst used in<br>
the first step is a Mo-Bi-based oxidation catalyst, which<br>
oxidizes propylene or the like to produce (meth)acrolein<br>
as a main product. Also, some acrolein is continuously<br>
oxidized on the same catalyst to partially produce<br>
(meth)acrylic acid. The catalyst used in the second step<br>
is a Mo-V-based oxidation catalyst, which mainly oxidizes<br>
(meth)acrolein in the mixed gas containing the<br>
(meth)acrolein produced from the first step to produce<br>
(meth)acrylic acid as a main product.<br>
2<br><br>
A reactor for performing the aforementioned process<br>
is provided either in such a manner that both the two-<br>
steps can be performed in one system, or in such a manner<br>
that the two steps can be performed in different systems.<br>
Recently, a catalyst for use in producing<br>
unsaturated acids such as (meth)acrylic acid from alkanes<br>
such as propane or isobutane via a single-step process has<br>
been developed.<br>
Meanwhile, (meth)acrylic acid manufacturers now<br>
conduct diversified efforts either to improve the<br>
structure of the reactor so as to increase the production<br>
of acrylic acid by the reactor, or to propose the most<br>
suitable catalyst to induce oxidation, or to improve<br>
process operations.<br>
In part of such prior efforts, propylene or the like<br>
 which is supplied into the reactor is. used at high space<br>
velocity and high concentration. However, in this case,<br>
rapid oxidation occurs in the reactor, which makes it<br>
difficult to control the resultant reaction temperature.<br>
Also, a hot spot is generated in the catalyst layer of the<br>
reactor, and heat accumulation occurs in the vicinity of<br>
the hot spot, resulting in increased production of<br>
byproducts, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and<br>
acetic acid at high temperature, and in a drop in yield of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.<br>
Furthermore, production of (meth)acrylic acid using<br>
high space velocity and high concentration of propylene or<br>
the like causes various problems, as the reaction<br>
temperature abnormally increases in the reactor, such<br>
problems including the loss of active ingredients from the<br>
catalyst layer, a drop in the number of active sites<br>
caused by sintering of metal components, or the like.<br>
Consequently, this leads to deterioration of the function<br>
3<br><br>
of the catalyst layer.<br>
Accordingly, in the production of (meth)acrylic<br>
acid, control of the reaction heat in the relevant reactor<br>
is of great importance. Particularly, not only the<br>
formation of hot spots in the catalyst layer but also the<br>
accumulation of heat in the vicinity of the hot spots must<br>
be inhibited, and the reactor must be effectively<br>
controlled so that the hot spots do not lead to reactor<br>
runaway (a state where the reactor cannot be controlled or<br>
explodes by a highly exothermic reaction). Therefore, it<br>
is very. important to inhibit hot spots and heat<br>
accumulation in the vicinity of the hot spots so as to<br>
extend the lifetime of the catalyst, to inhibit side<br>
reactions, and thus to increase yield of (meth)acrylic<br>
acid.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors of the present invention have made<br>
improvements in a fixed-bed shell-and-tube heat exchanger-<br>
type reactor for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated acids from olefins. In the improvements, at<br>
least one reaction zone of the first-step reaction zone<br>
and the second-step reaction zone was divided into two or<br>
more shell spaces along the axial direction by at least<br>
one partition, and the temperature of a heat transfer<br>
medium filled in each of the divided shell spaces was set<br>
to a temperature suitable for the activity of a catalyst<br>

reaction tube corresponding to the first shell space, to<br>
[the lowest active temperature + 20°C], when referring to<br>
the two or more shell spaces sequentially as the first<br>
shell space, the second shell space, . .., the nth shell<br>
space; and the first shell space is controlled in such a<br>

contribution per length = (mole number of unsaturated<br>
aldehydes or alkanes that have reacted in the relevant<br>
catalyst layer zone / mole number of the total unsaturated<br>
aldehydes or alkanes supplied to the reaction zone) /<br>
volumetric ratio of the relevant catalyst layer zone to<br>
the total catalyst layer of the reaction zone.<br>

first shell space of the second-step reaction zone is<br>
controlled in such a manner that it provides a reactant<br>
conversion contribution per length as defined in Equation<br>

each of the divided shell spaces is independently heat-<br>

first shell space is controlled in such a manner that it<br>
provides an alkane conversion contribution per length as<br>
defined in Equation 2 of 1.2~2.5.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained<br>
in more detail.<br>
(1) Disposition of Partition<br>
The inventors of the present invention have<br>
conducted many studies and obtained the following results.<br>
When a catalyst having a high activity corresponding to a<br>
conversion of 96% or more in the first-step reaction zone<br>
(for example, a catalyst having a conversion of 96% at a<br>
temperature, where the highest catalytic activity can be<br>
obtained, under a space velocity of feed of 1500 hr-1 and<br>
that of an olefin of 100 hr"1) is packed in the first-step<br>
reaction zone and the reaction zone is operated with no<br>
temperature control along the axial direction, a hot spot<br>
having a temperature near the sintering temperature of the<br>
catalyst is generated in the front portion of the first-<br>
step reaction zone. Additionally, when a catalyst having a<br>
high activity corresponding to an acrolein conversion of<br>
95% or more in the second-step reaction zone (for example,<br>
a catalyst having a conversion of 95% at a temperature,<br>
where the highest catalytic activity can be obtained,<br>
8<br><br>
under a space velocity of unsaturated aldehydes of 90 hr~<br>
l) is packed in the second-step reaction zone and the<br>
reaction zone is operated with no independent temperature<br>
control along the axial direction, a hot spot having a<br>
temperature near the sintering temperature of the catalyst<br>
is generated in the front portion of the second-step<br>
reaction zone. Such problem of hot spots also occurs in a<br>
single-step process for producing unsaturated acids from<br>
alkanes.<br>
In addition, it is not possible to sufficiently<br>
control the reaction heat of catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation mere by circulating a heat transfer medium<br>
uniformly in a reactor. A large hot spot is generated<br>
frequently, thereby causing excessive oxidation in a local<br>
site in the reactor. As a result, undesirable oxidation<br>
increases, resulting in a drop, in yield of the. target<br>
product. Moreover, catalysts are locally exposed to high<br>
 temperature conditions caused by the presence of a hot<br>
spot, resulting in degradation in lifetime of the<br>
catalysts.<br>
A hot spot refers to a site where the highest<br>
temperature peak is generated, and is formed by the<br>
generation of reaction heat caused by catalytic vapor<br>
phase oxidation. The hot spot is determined by the<br>
composition of reactants, the flow rate (L/min) of the<br>
reactants, the temperature of a heat transfer medium,<br>
etc., and has a certain position and magnitude under a<br>
certain process condition. Generally, each catalytic layer<br>
has at least one hot spot. However, since the activity of<br>
a catalyst varies with time, the position and temperature<br>
of a hot spot may also be varied.<br>
According to the present invention, a partition is<br>
disposed in such a manner that each shell space divided by<br>
9<br><br>
the partition has at least one temperature peak, after the<br>
characterization of the temperature profile of a catalyst<br>
layer. By doing so, a hot spot and zones near the hot spot<br>
having the possibility of heat accumulation can be heat-<br>
controlled intensively in an independent heat-control<br>
space. As used herein, the term "each divided shell space"<br>
indicates an internal space surrounded by a catalytic<br>
tube, a shell, a partition, a tube sheet, etc.<br>
In each reaction zone, the portions where heat<br>
control is problematic due to the hot spot include the<br>
front portion of a catalyst layer, in which main reactants<br>
including olefins, alkanes or unsaturated aldehydes, and<br>
molecular oxygen, are present at high concentrations.<br>
Also, if two or more catalyst layers are used in each<br>
step, such problematic portions include the vicinity of<br>
the boundary between the adjacent catalyst layers having<br>
different activities.<br>
The partition is preferably located at either a<br>
position where heat control is problematic due to the hot<br>
spot or heat accumulation caused by the hot spot, or a<br>
position allowing the largest possible removal of heat<br>
generation in each zone.<br>
Additionally, when each reaction zone is divided<br>
into two or more shell spaces by using at least one<br>
partition and is subjected to heat control, it is possible<br>
to provide the process with high flexibility under the<br>
variations in temperature profile characteristics.<br>
(2) Heat Control of Heat Transfer Medium of the<br>
First Shell Space of Each Step<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, at<br>
least one of the first-step reaction zone and the second-<br>
step reaction zone is divided into two or more shell<br>
spaces by at least one partition; each of the divided<br>
10<br><br>
shell spaces is independently heat-controlled; a heat<br>
transfer medium in the first shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone or the first shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone has a temperature ranging from the lowest<br>
active temperature of a catalyst layer packed in a<br>
reaction tube corresponding to the first shell space of<br>
the first-step reaction zone or the first shell space of<br>
the second-step reaction zone to [the lowest active<br>
temperature + 20 °C ], when referring to the two or more<br>
shell spaces corresponding to the first-step reaction zone<br>
sequentially as the first shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone, the second shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone, ..., the nth shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone, and the two or more shell spaces<br>
corresponding to the second-step reaction zone<br>
sequentially as the first shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, the second shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, .. ., the nth shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone (wherein n is an integer of 2 or more); and<br>
the first shell space of the first-step reaction zone or<br>
the first shell space of the second-step reaction zone is<br>
controlled in such a manner that it provides a reactant<br>
conversion contribution per length as defined in Equation<br>
1 or 2 of 1.2-2.5.<br>
According to another aspect of the present<br>
invention, in the case of a single-step process for<br>
producing unsaturated acids from alkanes, a reaction zone<br>
for producing the unsaturated acids is divided into two or<br>
more shell spaces by at least one partition; each of the<br>
divided shell spaces is independently heat-controlled; a<br>
heat transfer medium in the first shell space has a<br>
temperature ranging from the lowest active temperature of<br>
a catalyst layer packed in a reaction tube corresponding<br>
11<br><br>
to the first shell space to [the lowest active temperature<br>
+ 20°C], when referring to the two or more shell spaces<br>
sequentially as the first shell space, the second shell<br>
space, ..., the nth shell space; and the first shell space<br>
is controlled in such a manner that it provides an alkane<br>
conversion contribution per length as defined in Equation<br>
2 of 1.2-2.5.<br>
As used herein, the term "the lowest active<br>
temperature of the first-step catalyst layer" refers to<br>
the lowest temperature where the olefin conversion<br>
(defined by the following Equation 3) in the relevant<br>
catalyst layer reaches 90%, when the olefins, such as<br>
propylene or the like, are allowed to react with the<br>
relevant catalyst layer at a space velocity of about<br>
95-115 hr"1.<br>
The above space velocity of the olefins ranging from<br>
about 95 hr-1 to 115 hr"1 corresponds to a space velocity<br>
of total reaction feed gas introduced to the first-step<br>
reaction zone of about 1300~1500 hr-1, the feed gas<br>
comprising 7~7.5% of olefins, 13~15% of oxygen, 7~10% of<br>
water steam and the balance amount of inert gas.<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
Olefin conversion (%) = [mole number of reacted<br>
olefins/mole number of supplied olefins] X 100<br>
As used herein, the term "the lowest active<br>
temperature of the second-step catalyst layer" refers to<br>
the lowest temperature where the unsaturated aldehyde<br>
conversion (defined by the following Equation 4) in the<br>
relevant catalyst layer reaches 90%, when the unsaturated<br>
aldehydes are allowed to react with the relevant catalyst<br>
layer at a space velocity of about 75~100 hr"1.<br>
The above space velocity of the unsaturated<br>
aldehydes ranging from about 75 hr"1 to ' 100 hr"1<br>
12<br><br>
corresponds to a space velocity of total reaction feed gas<br>
introduced to the second-step reaction zone of about<br>
1050~-1700 hr-1, the feed gas comprising 5~6% of<br>
unsaturated aldehydes, 5.5~6.5% of oxygen, 1~2% of<br>
unsaturated acid, 12~17% of water steam, 1~2% of<br>
byproducts and the balance amount of inert gas.<br>
[Equation 4]<br>
Unsaturated aldehyde conversion (%)= [mole number of<br>
reacted unsaturated aldehydes/mole number of supplied<br>
unsaturated aldehydes] X 100<br>
Meanwhile, the lowest active temperature of the<br>
catalyst layer for producing unsaturated acids from<br>
alkanes refers to the lowest temperature where the alkane<br>
conversion (defined by the following Equation 5) in the<br>
relevant catalyst layer reaches 60%, when the alkanes are<br>
allowed to react with the relevant catalyst layer at a<br>
space velocity of about 50~80 hr"1.<br>
The above space velocity of the alkanes ranging from<br>
about 50 hr-1 to 8 0 hr"1 corresponds to a space velocity of<br>
total reaction feed gas introduced to the reaction zone of<br>
about 1500 - 2000 hr-1, the feed gas comprising 3~5% of<br>
alkanes, 10~15% of oxygen, 30~50% of water steam and the<br>
balance amount of inert gas.<br>
[Equation 5]<br>
Alkane conversion (%) = [mole number of reacted<br>
alkanes/mole number of supplied alkanes] X 100<br>
The lowest active temperature of a catalyst layer<br>
depends on the kind of the catalyst, content of the<br>
catalytic substance in the catalyst layer, ratio of main<br>
metal elements in the catalyst, presence of any alkali<br>
metal, kind of the alkali metal, mixing ratio with<br>
inactive materials, size of the catalyst, shape of the<br>
catalyst, sintering temperature of the catalyst, sintering<br>
13<br><br>
atmosphere of the catalyst, and combinations thereof.<br>
Generally, the first-step catalyst layer has an<br>
active temperature of 280~450°C, while the second-step<br>
catalyst layer has an active temperature of 250~370°C.<br>
Meanwhile, the catalyst layer for producing unsaturated<br>
acids from alkanes has an active temperature of<br>
350~420°C.<br>
The catalyst used in the first-step reaction zone is<br>
sintered generally at a temperature of 400~600°C, the<br>
catalyst used in the second-step reaction zone is sintered<br>
generally at a temperature of 300~500°C, and the catalyst<br>
used in the reaction zone for producing unsaturated acids<br>
from alkanes is sintered generally at a temperature of<br>
500~600°C. If the highest peak temperature of a catalyst<br>
layer exceeds the sintering temperature where the catalyst<br>
is sintered during the preparation thereof, the catalyst<br>
layer is deteriorated, resulting in a drop in yield of the<br>
target product.<br>
Additionally, when a catalyst layer is heated due to<br>
high reaction heat so that the hot spot temperature of the<br>
catalyst layer rapidly increases or heat accumulation<br>
occurs in the vicinity of the hot spot, oxidation forming<br>
byproducts such as COx and acetic acid occurs<br>
predominantly at such high temperature, resulting in a<br>
drop in yield of unsaturated acids.<br>
In general, in the first-step reaction zone and/or<br>
the second-step reaction zone, and the reaction zone for<br>
producing unsaturated acids from alkanes via a single-step<br>
process, each front portion, for example, the catalyst<br>
layer corresponding to the first shell space of each step<br>
shows a high concentration of reactants (olefins,<br>
unsaturated aldehydes or alkanes) and a high reaction<br>
pressure, and consequently leads to a severe reaction. As<br>
14<br><br>
a result, a hot spot with a significantly large magnitude<br>
is formed in the front portion of each reaction zone.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that the reaction in the above<br>
portion is controlled in such a manner that the peak<br>
temperature of the relevant catalyst layer is<br>
significantly lower than the sintering temperature of the<br>
catalyst. Additionally, although each catalyst layer<br>
corresponding to the first shell space of each step<br>
comprises 20~30% of the total length of the catalyst<br>
layer, conversion of reactants in the first shell space<br>
reaches 50% or more. In other words, the first shell space<br>
has an excessively high load of reaction in view of its<br>
proportion to the total catalyst layer, and thus may be<br>
thermally unstabilized with ease due to the high reaction<br>
heat.<br>
Therefore, in order to solve the aforementioned<br>
problem caused by the first shell space of each step, the<br>
temperature of the heat transfer medium in the first shell<br>
space of each step is decreased possibly to the lowest<br>
active temperature of the catalyst, according to the<br>
present invention. By doing so, it is possible to control<br>
the magnitude of a hot spot and to prevent heat<br>
accumulation in the vicinity of the hot spot, while not<br>
degrading reactivity severely.<br>
Since a hot spot has a magnitude and a position<br>
variable depending on the kind and activity of the<br>
catalyst used in the relevant catalyst layer, the<br>
temperature of a heat transfer medium is preferably<br>
controlled considering the characteristics and reactivity<br>
of the catalyst.<br>
The reactivity of the catalyst layer corresponding<br>
to each shell space can be expressed by the reactant<br>
conversion contribution per length, represented by<br>
15<br><br>
Equations 1 and 2.<br>
To satisfy the condition of the reactant conversion<br>
contribution per length being 1.2-2.5, temperature of a<br>
heat transfer medium, shear pressure (pressure of the<br>
reactor inlet), space velocity, activity of a catalyst,<br>
etc. may be controlled.<br>
The partition dividing the first shell space of each<br>
step from the second shell space of each step is disposed<br>
in such a manner that the first shell space includes a<br>
temperature peak occurring in the inlet portion of each<br>
reaction zone.<br>
Preferably, the first partition dividing the first<br>
shell space from the second shell space is disposed in a<br>
position corresponding to 25%~50% of the axial length of<br>
the reaction zone of each step. This indicates that<br>
contact- time in the first shell space of each step<br>
corresponds to about 25%~50% of the total contact time of<br>
each step. For example, when the first-step reaction zone<br>
has a total axial length of 3000mm, the first partition<br>
may be disposed at a point of 1200mm, which corresponds to<br>
40% of the total length. However, the first partition<br>
should be in such a position with the proviso that the<br>
reactant conversion contribution (defined by Equation 3, 4<br>
or 5) of the first shell space ranges from 1.2 to 2.5.<br>
(3) Heat Control of Heat Transfer Medium of Each<br>
Shell Space<br>
In the production process and heat exchanger-type<br>
reactor according to the present invention, the<br>
temperature of the heat transfer medium in each shell<br>
space is set as nearly as possible to isothermal<br>
conditions. According to the amount of heat generation<br>
and the capacity of the heat transfer medium, the<br>
temperature difference between portions of the heat<br>
16<br><br>
transfer medium, which correspond to both the ends of a<br>
catalyst layer in each of the divided shell spaces, is<br>
preferably 0-5 °C, and more preferably 0-3 °C.<br>
Examples of the heat transfer medium include a very<br>
highly viscous medium, for example a molten salt which<br>
consists mainly of a mixture of potassium nitrate and<br>
sodium nitrite. Other examples of the heat transfer<br>
medium include a phenyl ether medium (e.g., "Dowtherm"),<br>
polyphenyl media (e.g., "Therm S"), hot oil, a naphthalene<br>
derivative (S.K. oil) and mercury.<br>
By controlling the flow rate of the heat transfer<br>
medium, the reaction throughout the tube corresponding to<br>
each of the shell spaces in the reactor can be carried out<br>
at substantially the same molten salt temperature.<br>
When heat transfer media filled in shell spaces have<br>
different temperatures along the flow direction (also<br>
referred to as the axial direction hereinafter) of<br>
reactants, reactivity of the relevant catalyst layer<br>
varies in proportion to the temperature.<br>
It is preferable to set the temperature of the heat<br>
transfer medium (molten salt or heat transfer salt) in<br>
each of the divided shell spaces in such a manner that the<br>
relevant catalyst layer has optimal activity.<br>
Particularly, the temperature of the heat transfer<br>
media can be varied in the axial direction according to<br>
the present invention. Thus, it is possible to inhibit the<br>
catalyst from being damaged by an excessively high<br>
exothermic reaction and to prevent degradation in yield of<br>
the target product, resulting in improvement of the yield.<br>
The temperature of the heat transfer media in the<br>
adjacent shell spaces in each of the reaction zones is<br>
preferably set to cause a temperature difference 0-50 °C,<br>
and more preferably 5-15 °C along the axial direction.<br>
17<br><br>
In the case of the first-step reaction zone, it is<br>
preferred that the temperature of the heat transfer medium<br>
in each of the first shell space of the first step, the<br>
second shell space of the first step, . . ., the nth shell<br>
space of the first step, divided by partitions, is set in<br>
such a manner that the temperature of each heat transfer<br>
medium increases along the axial direction.<br>
In the case of the second-step reaction zone, the<br>
heat transfer medium in each of the first shell space of<br>
the second step, the second shell space of the second<br>
step, ..., the nth shell space of the second step, divided<br>
by partitions, does not increase or decrease monotonously,<br>
because the product of the first step is supplied to the<br>
reaction zone corresponding to the first shell space of<br>
the second step. It is preferred to set the temperature of<br>
the heat transfer medium in each shell space in such a<br>
manner that the temperature of the heat transfer medium<br>
increases monotonously from the second shell space to the<br>
nth shell space except the first shell space, and the<br>
temperature of the first shell space is set according to<br>
the manner as described hereinafter related to the<br>
temperature setting in the second-step reaction zone.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of the reaction zone for<br>
producing unsaturated acids from alkanes via a single-step<br>
process, it is preferred that the temperature of the heat<br>
transfer medium circulating in each of the first shell<br>
space, the second shell space, ..., the nth shell space,<br>
divided by partitions, is set in such a manner that the<br>
temperature of each heat transfer medium increases along<br>
the axial direction.<br>
Further, according to the present invention it is<br>
preferred that Thi-Tsaiti ^ 150 °C, more preferably Thi-Tsaiti ^<br>
110 °C, and ThN-TsaltN 
18<br><br>
100 °C (wherein N is an integer of 2 or more), when<br>
referring to the shell spaces divided by partitions in the<br>
first-step reaction zone for producing unsaturated<br>
aldehydes from olefins or the reaction zone for producing<br>
unsaturated acids from alkanes sequentially as the first<br>
shell space, the second shell space, . . . , the nth shell<br>
space.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that Thi-Tsaiti ^ 130 °C,<br>
more preferably Thi-Tsaitl 
more preferably ThN_TSaitN ^ 70 °C (wherein N is an integer<br>
of 2 or more), when referring to the shell spaces divided<br>
by partitions in the second-step reaction zone for<br>
producing unsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes<br>
sequentially as the first shell space, the second shell<br>
space, ..., the nth shell space.<br>
Herein, Thi is the highest peak temperature of a<br>
reaction mixture in the catalyst layer corresponding to<br>
the first shell space (the highest peak temperature of the<br>
catalyst layer), and ThN is the highest peak temperature<br>
of the reaction mixture in the catalyst layer<br>
corresponding to the nth shell space (the highest peak<br>
temperature of the catalyst layer) . Additionally, Tsaiti is<br>
the temperature of the heat transfer medium filled in the<br>
first shell space, and TsaitN is the temperature of the<br>
heat transfer medium filled in the nth shell space.<br>
In the first shell space, the concentration and<br>
pressure of reactants are high, so that the temperature<br>
difference between the highest peak temperature of the<br>
catalyst layer and the temperature of the heat transfer<br>
medium is higher than that in the next shell space. For<br>
this reason, the temperature difference range in the first<br>
shell space will be surely wider than those in the next<br>
shell spaces. However, the present invention provides a<br>
19<br><br>
method by which the magnitude of peak temperature in the<br>
first shell space is minimized while a temperature<br>
difference in the next shell space is limited in an<br>
extended range, thereby forming an overall temperature<br>
profile having a smooth shape.<br>
According to the present invention, the temperature<br>
difference, between the highest peak temperature of a<br>
catalyst layer in each.reaction zone and the temperature<br>
of a heat transfer medium is controlled as described<br>
above, so that the catalyst can show uniform activity in<br>
the axial direction. Thus, it is possible to inhibit heat<br>
accumulation in a hot spot and suppress side reactions,<br>
thereby preventing a drop in yield.<br>
(4)	Constitution of Catalyst Layers<br>
The catalyst layer in the first-step reaction zone<br>
may consist of one layer with axially uniform activity, or<br>
if necessary, two or more stacked layers with increasing<br>
activity. The catalyst layer in the second-step reaction<br>
zone may consist of one layer with axially uniform<br>
activity, or if necessary, two or more stacked layers with<br>
increasing activity. The catalyst layer of the reaction<br>
zone for producing unsaturated acids from alkanes may be<br>
formed in the same manner as described above.<br>
(5)	Constitution of Reaction Inhibition Layer<br>
Preferably, a layer formed of an inactive material<br>
or a mixture of an inactive material and a catalytic<br>
material, i.e., a reaction inhibition layer, is disposed<br>
within a portion of the catalytic tube, which corresponds<br>
to a position where the partition is disposed. By doing<br>
so, it is possible to eliminate a problem in heat transfer<br>
at the position where the partition is disposed.<br>
A commercially available shell-and-tube reactor for<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid includes catalytic tubes in<br>
20<br><br>
the number of several hundreds • to several tens of<br>
thousands, and a partition disposed in such a reactor has<br>
a relatively large thickness of 50~100mm. Therefore, in<br>
the reaction zone of each step having two or more divided<br>
shell spaces, it is difficult to remove the reaction heat<br>
at the portion where a partition is disposed, thereby<br>
causing a problem in heat transfer. To solve this problem,<br>
it is preferred to dispose a layer formed of an inactive<br>
material or a mixture of an inactive material and a<br>
catalytic material, i.e., a reaction inhibition layer<br>
within a portion of the catalytic tube, which corresponds<br>
to a position where the partition is disposed.<br>
In the reaction inhibition layer, the volume ratio<br>
of an inactive material to a catalytic material in this<br>
reaction inhibition layer is 20~100%.<br>
The inactive material used in the reaction<br>
inhibition layer is designated as a material which is<br>
inactive to a reaction for producing unsaturated aldehydes<br>
and/or unsaturated acids from olefins and/or alkanes, for<br>
example, catalytic oxidation of propylene or the like and<br>
(meth) acrolein. It can be used in a sphere, cylinder,<br>
ring, rod, plate or wire mesh shape, or a mass shape with<br>
suitable size, or a suitable combination thereof. Widely<br>
known examples of the inactive material include alumina,<br>
silica alumina, stainless steel, iron, steatite,<br>
porcelain, various ceramics, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the reaction inhibition layer is packed<br>
to a height corresponding to 20-500% of the thickness of<br>
a partition.<br>
The heat control system according to the present<br>
invention can be applied not only to oxidation of olefins<br>
but also to a reaction system for carrying out different<br>
reactions along the axial direction in a stepwise manner<br>
21<br><br>
and a reaction system requiring independent heat control<br>
of every reaction zone to the optimal temperature even if<br>
the reaction zones perform the same reaction.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is to<br>
be understood that the following examples are illustrative<br>
only and the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Reference Example 1: Determination of Lowest Active<br>
Temperature of Catalyst Layer Corresponding to First Shell<br>
Space of First Step<br>
A pilot reactor in which the first step is conducted<br>
in one catalytic tube was provided. The catalytic tube had<br>
an inner diameter of 26mm. In the first-step catalytic<br>
tube, a catalyst layer was packed to a height of about<br>
1200 mm. At this time, two kinds of catalysts having<br>
activity increasing along the axial direction from the<br>
inlet to the outlet were packed to a height of 320mm and<br>
880mmf respectively (see "Method of Controlling Catalytic<br>
Activity" described in US3801634 and US4837360) . The<br>
catalyst was comprised of the first-step oxidation<br>
catalyst material obtained according to the method as<br>
22<br><br>
disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 0349602 (Korean<br>
Patent Application No. 10-1997-0045132), the catalyst<br>
material being based on molybdenum (Mo) and bismuth (Bi).<br>
The first catalyst layer (referred to as LGC1<br>
hereinafter) of the first-step reaction zone showed an<br>
activity corresponding to 85~90% of the catalytic<br>
activity of the second catalyst layer, when measuring the<br>
catalytic activity by propylene conversion (space velocity<br>
of propylene 98 hr-1, molten salt temperature of 300°C).<br>
Like the following Example 1, the first shell space<br>
included the peak portion of the second catalyst layer,<br>
and the catalyst layer of the first shell space had a<br>
length of 540mm.<br>
The starting materials introduced into the inlet of<br>
the reactor were comprised of propylene, oxygen, steam and<br>
nitrogen gas, wherein propylene content was 7% and the<br>
ratio of oxygen to propylene was about 1.80. Based on the<br>
catalyst layer corresponding to the first shell space of<br>
the first-step reaction zone (catalyst layer of 540mm<br>
corresponding to the first shell space) , space velocity<br>
was 1400 hr-1 (standard temperature and pressure, STP) ,<br>
and space velocity of the olefins introduced into the<br>
first-step reaction zone was 98-hr-1 (STP).<br>
* Space velocity= flow rate of feed (L/hr, STP)/<br>
volume of catalyst layer (L)<br>
The above conditions were the same as those of the<br>
following Example 1, with the exception of the space<br>
velocity and the temperature of molten salt.<br>
(1) When the molten salt filled in the first shell<br>
space of the first step was set to a temperature of 285°C,<br>
it was shown that propylene conversion was 8 6.2% after the<br>
analysis of the gas obtained from the outlet of the first<br>
shell space of the first step.<br>
23<br><br>
(2)	When the molten salt filled in the first shell<br>
space of the first step was set to a temperature of 290°C,<br>
it was shown that propylene conversion was 88.3% after the<br>
analysis of the gas obtained from the outlet of the first<br>
shell space of the first step.<br>
(3)	When the molten salt filled in the first shell<br>
space of the first step was set to a temperature of 295°C,<br>
it was shown that propylene conversion was 90.8% after the<br>
analysis of the gas obtained from the outlet of the first<br>
shell space of the first step.<br>
(4)	As can be seen from the above results, the<br>
catalyst layer used in Reference Example 1 has the lowest<br>
active temperature of 290°C.<br>
Example 1: Variations in Yield and in Magnitudes of<br>
Temperature Peaks at Hot Spots Depending on Variations in<br>
Temperature Setting of Molten Salt<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a pilot reactor was provided in<br>
which each of first-step reaction and second-step reaction<br>
is conducted in one catalytic tube (included in zone 10 or<br>
20 of FIG. 3) . The catalytic tube had an inner diameter<br>
of 26 mm, and the first-step catalytic tube was filled<br>
with catalyst layers to a height of about 1200 mm, and the<br>
second-step catalytic tube was filled with catalyst layers<br>
to a height of about 1100 mm.<br>
In the catalyst layers of the first step reaction<br>
zone 10, two kinds of catalysts having activity increasing<br>
along the axial direction from the inlet to the outlet<br>
were packed to a height of 320mm and 880mm, respectively<br>
(see "Method of Controlling Catalytic Activity" described<br>
in US3801634 and US4837360). In the catalyst layers of the<br>
second-step reaction zone 20, two kinds of catalysts<br>
having activity increasing along the axial direction from<br>
the inlet to the outlet were packed a height of 290mm and<br>
24<br><br>
810mm, respectively.<br>
The catalyst layers of the first-step reaction zone<br>
were comprised of the first-step oxidation catalyst<br>
material obtained according to the method as disclosed in<br>
Korean Patent Publication No. 034 9602 (Korean Patent<br>
Application No. 10-1997-0045132), the catalyst material<br>
being based on molybdenum (Mo) and bismuth (Bi) . The<br>
catalyst layers of the second-step reaction zone were<br>
comprised of a catalyst based on molybdenum and vanadium<br>
(V) , the preparation of which is described in Korean<br>
patent No. 0204728 or Korean patent No. 0204729.<br>
In the first catalyst layer of the first-step<br>
reaction zone, LGC1 catalyst was used. The catalyst showed<br>
an activity corresponding to 85~90% of the catalytic<br>
activity of the second catalyst layer, when measuring the<br>
catalytic activity by propylene conversion (space velocity<br>
of propylene 98 hr-1, molten salt temperature of 300°C) .<br>
The first catalyst layer of the second-step reaction<br>
zone showed an activity corresponding to 85~90% of the<br>
catalytic activity of the second catalyst layer.<br>
A partition was disposed at the 600~mm position<br>
(central portion) of the first-step reaction zone, so that<br>
the first shell space of the first step covered both<br>
temperature peaks occurring in the first catalyst layer of<br>
the first step and the second catalyst layer of the first<br>
step. In a portion inside the catalytic tube<br>
corresponding to the position of the partition, an<br>
inactive material layer was filled to a thickness<br>
corresponding 120% of the thickness of the partition.<br>
Reference numerals 11 and 12 in FIG. 1 illustrate<br>
the shell spaces divided in the first-step reaction zone.<br>
Each molten salt filled in each shell space was set to a<br>
temperature of 308 °C and 315°C, respectively. Reference<br>
25<br><br>
numeral 21 in FIG. 1 illustrate a shell space of the<br>
second-step reaction zone, the shell space being filled<br>
with a molten salt set to a temperature of 265°C.<br>
A pipe inducing a flow represented by reference<br>
numeral 2 in FIG. 1 serves to connect the two catalytic<br>
tubes and is surrounded by a heat insulation material.<br>
Starting materials comprising propylene, steam, oxygen and<br>
inert gas enter the reactor through a line 1, passes<br>
through the reaction steps, and then flows out from the<br>
reactor through a line 3. The starting materials were<br>
comprised of propylene, oxygen, steam and nitrogen gas,<br>
wherein the propylene content was 7% and the ratio of<br>
oxygen to propylene was about 1.80. Space velocity was<br>
1400 hr-1 (standard temperature and pressure, STP) in the<br>
total first-step reaction zone, and 1530 hr"1 (STP) in the<br>
total second-step reaction zone. Also,, the space velocity<br>
of olefins introduced into the first-step reaction zone<br>
was 98 hr"1 (STP) .<br>
In the first shell space of the first step, the<br>
value defined by Equation 1 was about 2.<br>
A hot spot was generated in the zone corresponding<br>
to the first shell space of the first-step reaction zone,<br>
the hot spot having a temperature of 392.5°C. After the<br>
reaction in the first-step reaction zone, acrolein and<br>
acrylic acid were obtained in a yield of 80.33% and<br>
11.37%, respectively. In the second-step reaction zone<br>
operated under isothermal conditions, a hot spot having a<br>
temperature of 320.5°C was generated. After the reaction<br>
in the second-step reaction zone, acrolein and acrylic<br>
acid were obtained in a yield of 0.631% and 86.83%,<br>
respectively.<br>
Since no reaction occurred in the reaction<br>
inhibition layer (inactive material layer), no abnormal<br>
26<br><br>
increase in temperature caused by a drop in heat transfer<br>
efficiency could be observed.<br>
Example 2: Variations in Yield and in Magnitudes of<br>
Temperature Peaks at Hot Spots Depending on Variations in<br>
Temperature Setting of Molten Salt<br>
This example was performed in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 1, except that the temperatures of<br>
the molten salt in the first-step reaction zone (first-<br>
step reactor) were set to 300 °C and 315 °C, respectively,<br>
in an axial direction. In the first shell space of the<br>
first step, the value defined by Equation 1 was about 1.9.<br>
In the zone corresponding to the first shell space<br>
in the first-step reaction zone, a hot spot with a<br>
temperature of 381.2 °C was generated. The yields of<br>
acrolein and acrylic acid were 79.02% and 11.46%,<br>
respectively. In the second-step reaction zone operated<br>
under isothermal conditions, the temperature of a hot spot<br>
was 327.5 °C, and the yields of acrolein and acrylic acid<br>
were 0.607% and 84.95%, respectively.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
This example was performed in the same manner as<br>
described in Example- 1, except that the temperature of the<br>
molten salt filled in each shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone was set to 310°C. The temperature, 310"C, of<br>
the molten salt in the first-step reaction zone is higher<br>
than the lowest active temperature by 20°C.<br>
In the first-step reactor operated under isothermal<br>
conditions, a hot spot with a temperature of 405.7 °C was<br>
generated. The yields of acrolein and acrylic acid were<br>
80.43% and 10.11%, respectively. In the second-step<br>
reaction zone operated under isothermal conditions, the<br>
temperature of a hot spot was 316.0 °C, and the yields of<br>
acrolein and acrylic acid were 1.257% and 84.66%,<br>
27<br><br>
respectively.<br>
After the analysis of the conversion in the portion<br>
corresponding to the first shell space of the first step<br>
according to Comparative Example 1, the value defined by<br>
Equation 1 was 2.7.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
This example was performed in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 1, except that the temperature of the<br>
molten salt filled in each shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone was set to 320°C. The temperature, 320°C, of<br>
the molten salt in the first-step reaction zone is higher<br>
than the lowest active temperature by 30°C .<br>
As the highest peak temperature of the first-step<br>
catalyst layer exceeds 430°C, the catalyst layer was<br>
damaged so that the total propylene conversion decreased<br>
rapidly to a level less than 90%. So, the test was<br>
terminated.<br>
Before the catalyst layer was damaged, conversion in<br>
the portion corresponding to the first shell space of the<br>
first step according to Comparative Example 2 was<br>
analyzed. As a result, the value defined by Equation 1 was<br>
3.01.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
This example was performed in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 1, except that the temperature of the<br>
molten salt filled in each shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone was set to 312°C. The temperature, 312°C, of<br>
the molten salt in the first-step reaction zone is higher<br>
than the lowest active temperature by 22°C.<br>
In the first-step reactor operated under isothermal<br>
conditions, a hot spot with a temperature of 409.1 °C was<br>
generated. The yields of acrolein and acrylic acid were<br>
78.8% and 11.9%, respectively. In the second-step<br>
28<br><br>
reaction zone operated under isothermal conditions, the<br>
temperature of a hot spot was 32 9.2 °C, and the yields of<br>
acrolein and acrylic acid were 0.367% and 85.08%,<br>
respectively.<br>
After the analysis of the conversion in the portion<br>
corresponding to the first shell space of the first step<br>
according to Comparative Example 3, the value defined by<br>

Temperature of Catalyst Layer Corresponding to First Shell<br>
Space of Second Step<br>
A pilot reactor in which the first-step reaction and<br>
the second-step reaction are conducted in one catalytic<br>
tube was provided. The catalytic tube had an inner<br>
diameter of 26mm. In the catalytic tube, a first-step<br>
catalyst layer was packed to a height of about 3570 mm,<br>
and the second-step catalyst layer was packed to a height<br>
of about 3125 mm. Herein, the catalyst material filled in<br>
29<br><br>
the first-step reaction zone (reference numeral 10 in FIG.<br>
2) was the first-step oxidation catalyst material obtained<br>
according to the method as disclosed in Korean Patent<br>
Publication No. 0349602 (Korean Patent Application No. 10-<br>
1997-0045132) , the catalyst material being based on<br>
molybdenum (Mo) and bismuth (Bi). The three catalyst<br>
layers filled in the second-step reaction zone (reference<br>
numeral 20 in FIG. 2) were comprised of a catalyst based<br>
on molybdenum and vanadium (V) , the preparation of which<br>
is described in Korean patent No. 0204728 or Korean patent<br>
No. 0204729.<br>
The second-step catalyst layers were comprised of<br>
three kinds of catalysts having activity increasing along<br>
the axial direction from the inlet to the outlet (see<br>
"Method of Controlling Catalytic Activity" described in<br>
US3801634 and US4837360). The first catalyst layer<br>
(reference numeral 21 in FIG. 2) of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, from which the second-step reaction<br>
started, showed an activity corresponding to about 20% of<br>
the catalytic activity of the third catalyst layer of the<br>
second step (reference numeral 23 in FIG. 2) . This was<br>
accomplished by forming the first catalyst layer with a<br>
mixture containing 2 0 wt% of the same catalyst material as<br>
the third catalyst layer and 80 wt% of an inactive<br>
material. The second catalyst layer of the second step<br>
(reference numeral 22 in FIG. 2) showed an activity<br>
corresponding to 87% of the catalytic activity of the<br>
third catalyst layer of the second step.<br>
The three catalyst layers of the second-step<br>
reaction zone were packed to a height of 500mm, 700mm and<br>
1925mm, respectively, along the axial direction. The first<br>
catalyst layer of the second step was packed to a height<br>
of 250mm in the catalytic tube corresponding to the shell<br>
30<br><br>
spaces of the second-step reaction zone, and the remaining<br>
250mm was disposed in the partition (reference numeral 30<br>
in FIG. 2) , by which the first-step reaction zone was<br>
divided from the second-step reaction zone, and in the<br>
catalytic tube covering the shell spaces of the first-step<br>
reaction zone.<br>
The second-step reaction zone was divided into two<br>
independent shell spaces (reference numerals 24 and 25 in<br>
FIG. 2) by the partition (reference numeral 27 in FIG. 2)<br>
disposed in the boundary between the second catalyst layer<br>
of the second step and the third catalyst layer of the<br>
second step. Meanwhile, an inactive material layer was<br>
packed in the catalytic tube at the portion corresponding<br>
to the position of the partition to a height corresponding<br>
to 120% of the thickness of the partition.<br>
The- starting materials introduced into the inlet of<br>
the second-step reaction zone (i.e., the partition 30 by<br>
which the first-step reaction zone was divided from the<br>
second-step reaction zone) were comprised of acrolein,<br>
acrylic acid, oxygen, steam and nitrogen gas, more<br>
particularly, 5.5% of acrolein, 0.9% of acrylic acid, 5.0%<br>
of oxygen, 1.0% of byproducts such as COx and acetic acid,<br>
and the balance amount of nitrogen gas.<br>
In the catalyst layers corresponding to the first<br>
shell space of the second-step reaction zone (catalyst<br>
layer of 950mm corresponding to 250mm of the first<br>
catalyst layer combined with 700mm of the second catalyst<br>
layer), space velocity was 1500 hr-1 (standard temperature<br>
and pressure, STP) . Herein, space velocity of the<br>
hydrocarbon reactant, i.e. acrolein, introduced into the<br>
second-step reaction zone was 81 hr-1 (STP) and the feed<br>
gas mixture had a pressure of 0.4kgf/cm2G.<br>
The above conditions were the same as those of the<br>
31<br><br>
following Example 3, with the exception of the space<br>
velocity and the temperature of molten salt.<br>
(1)	When the molten salt filled in the first shell<br>
space of the second step was set to a temperature of<br>
255 °C, it was shown that the conversion defined by<br>
Equation 4 was 83.1% after the analysis of the gas<br>
obtained from the outlet of the first shell space of the<br>
second step.<br>
(2)	When the molten salt filled in the first shell<br>
space of the second step was set to a temperature of<br>
260 °C, it was shown that the conversion defined by<br>
Equation 4 was 91.9% after the analysis of the gas<br>
obtained from the outlet of the first shell space of the<br>
second step.<br>
As can be seen from the above results, the catalyst<br>
layer has the lowest active temperature of 260"C.<br>
Example 3 (Use of Mixed Layers and Multi-step Heat<br>
Control System)<br>
A pilot reactor in which the first-step reaction and<br>
the second-step reaction are conducted in one catalytic<br>
tube was provided. The catalytic tube had an inner<br>
diameter of 2 6mm. In the catalytic tube, a first-step<br>
catalyst layer was packed to a height of about 357 0 mm,<br>
and the second-step catalyst layer was packed to a height<br>
of about 3125 mm. Herein, the catalyst material filled in<br>
the first-step reaction zone (reference numeral 10 in FIG.<br>
2) was the first-step oxidation catalyst material obtained<br>
according to the method as disclosed in Korean Patent<br>
Publication No. 0349602 (Korean Patent Application No. 10-<br>
1997-0045132), the catalyst material being based on<br>
molybdenum (Mo) and bismuth (Bi). The three catalyst<br>
layers filled in the second-step reaction zone (reference<br>
numeral 20 in FIG. 2) were comprised of a catalyst based<br>
32<br><br>
on molybdenum and vanadium (V) , the preparation of which<br>
is described in Korean patent No. 0204728 or Korean patent<br>
No. 0204729.<br>
The second-step catalyst layers were comprised of<br>
three kinds of catalysts having activity increasing along<br>
the axial direction from the inlet to the outlet (see<br>
"Method of Controlling Catalytic Activity" described in<br>
US3801634 and US4837360). The first catalyst layer<br>
(reference numeral 21 in FIG. 2) of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, from which the second-step reaction<br>
started, showed an activity corresponding to about 20% of<br>
the catalytic activity of the third catalyst layer of the<br>
second step (reference numeral 23 in FIG. 2). This was<br>
accomplished by forming the first catalyst layer with a<br>
mixture containing 20 wt% of the same catalyst material as<br>
the third catalyst layer and 80 wt% of an inactive<br>
material. The second catalyst layer of the second step<br>
(reference numeral 22 in FIG. 2) showed an activity<br>
corresponding to 87% of the catalytic activity of the<br>
third catalyst layer of the second step.<br>
The three catalyst layers of the second-step<br>
reaction zone were packed to a height of 500mm, 700mm and<br>
1925mm, respectively, along the axial direction. The first<br>
catalyst layer of the second step was packed to a height<br>
of 250mm in the catalytic tube corresponding to the shell<br>
spaces of the second-step reaction zone, and the remaining<br>
250mm was disposed in the partition (reference numeral 30<br>
in FIG. 2), by which the first-step reaction zone was<br>
divided from the second-step reaction zone, and in the<br>
catalytic tube covering the shell spaces of the first-step<br>
reaction zone.<br>
The second-step reaction zone was divided into two<br>
independent shell spaces (reference numerals 24 and 25 in<br>
33<br><br>
FIG. 2) by the partition (reference numeral 27 in FIG. 2)<br>
disposed in the boundary between the second catalyst layer<br>
of the second step and the third catalyst layer of the<br>
second step. Each molten salt filled in each shell space<br>
was set to a temperature of 275°C and 270°C, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, an inactive material layer was packed in the<br>
catalytic tube at the portion corresponding to the<br>
position of the partition to a height corresponding to<br>
120% of the thickness of the partition (reference numeral<br>
26 in FIG. 2) .<br>
The starting materials introduced into the inlet of<br>
the second-step reaction zone, (i.e. the partition 30, by<br>
which the first-step reaction zone was divided from the<br>
second-step reaction zone) were comprised of acrolein,<br>
acrylic acid, oxygen, steam and nitrogen gas, more<br>
particularly, 5.5% of acrolein, 0.9% of acrylic acid, 5.0%<br>
of oxygen, 1.0% of byproducts such as COx and acetic acid,<br>
and the balance amount of nitrogen gas. In the total<br>
second-step reaction zone, space velocity was 1500 hr"1<br>
(standard temperature and pressure, STP). Herein, space<br>
velocity of the hydrocarbon reactant, i.e. acrolein,<br>
introduced into the second-step reaction zone was 81 hr"1<br>
(STP) and the feed gas mixture had a pressure of<br>
0.4kgf/cm2G.<br>
In the reaction zone corresponding to the first<br>
shell space of the second step, the value defined by<br>
Equation 2 was about 2.<br>
In the second-step reaction zone, two catalyst<br>
layers of the three catalyst layers except the mixed layer<br>
(i.e. the first catalyst layer) had a temperature peak.<br>
The two peak temperatures were 309. 4°C and 321.7°C along<br>
the axial direction. When the propylene content introduced<br>
into the first step was 7.0%, yield of acrylic acid was<br>
34<br><br>
86.2%. Yields of byproducts, COx (carbon monooxide and<br>
carbon dioxide) and acetic acids, were 8.51% and 1.80%,<br>
respectively.<br>
The reaction mixture arriving in the first catalyst<br>
layer of the second step along the axial direction had a<br>
temperature of 316°C, and the temperature difference<br>
between the above temperature and the first heat transfer<br>
medium of the second step was 41°C.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
This example was performed in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 3, except that the temperature of the<br>
molten salt filled in each shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone was set to 285°C. The temperature, 285"C, is<br>
higher than the lowest active temperature by 25 °C, and<br>
thus is not included in the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the reaction zone corresponding to the first<br>
shell space of the second step according to Comparative<br>
Example 4, the value defined by Equation 2 was about 2.2,<br>
which was included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the second-step reaction zone, two catalyst layers of<br>
the three catalyst layers except the mixed layer (i.e. the<br>
first catalyst layer) had a temperature peak. The two peak<br>
temperatures were 331. 3°C and 328.1°C along the axial<br>
direction. Yield of acrylic acid was 83.8%, and the yields<br>
of byproducts, COx (carbon monooxide and carbon dioxide)<br>
and acetic acid were 11.3% and 2.12%, respectively.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the present invention provides<br>
an improved system in which the temperature of a heat<br>
transfer medium in each shell space is controlled<br>
depending on the activity of a catalyst and the degree of<br>
reaction. By doing so, it is possible to inhibit heat<br>
accumulation in a hot spot and the vicinity thereof, and<br>
thus to ensure thermal stability, to reduce the production<br>
of byproducts and to improve the yield of a final product.<br>

catalyst layer zone / mole number of the total alkanes<br>
supplied to the reaction zone) / volumetric ratio of the<br>
relevant catalyst layer zone to the total catalyst layer<br>
of the reaction zone.<br>
43<br><br>
Disclosed is a process for producing unsaturated<br>
aldehydes and/or unsaturated acids from olefins or alkanes in a<br>
fixed bed shell-and-tube heat exchanger-type reactor by catalytic<br>
vapor phase oxidation. A heat exchanger-type reactor for use in<br>
such a process is also disclosed. In the process, at least one of<br>
the first-step reaction zone and the second-step reaction zone is<br>
divided into two or more shell spaces by at least one partition;<br>
each of the divided shell spaces is independently heat-controlled;<br>
a heat transfer medium in the first shell space of the first-step<br>
reaction zone or the first shell space of the second-step reaction<br>
zone has a temperature ranging from the lowest active temperature<br>
of a catalyst layer packed in a reaction tube corresponding to<br>
the first shell space of the first-step reaction zone or the first<br>
shell space of the second-step reaction zone to [the lowest active<br>
temperature + 20 °C], when referring to the two or more shell<br>
spaces corresponding to the first-step reaction zone sequentially<br>
as the first shell space of the first-step reaction zone, the second<br>
shell space of the first-step reaction zone, ..., the nth shell space<br>
of the first-step reaction zone, and the two or more shell spaces<br>
corresponding to the second-step reaction zone sequentially as<br>
the First shell space of the second-step reaction zone, the second<br>
shell space of the second-step reaction zone,... , the nth shell space<br>
of the second-step reaction zone; and the first shell space of the<br>
first-step reaction zone or the first shell space of the second-step<br>
reaction zone is controlled in such a manner that the first shell<br>
space provides a reactant conversion contribution per length as<br>
defined in Equation 1 or 2 of 1.2-2.5.</td>
