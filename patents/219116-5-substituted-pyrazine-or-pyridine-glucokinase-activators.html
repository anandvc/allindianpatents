5-SUBSTITUTED-PYRAZINE OR PYRIDINE GLUCOKINASE ACTIVATORS<br>
[0001] Glucokinase (GK) is one of four hexokinases that are found in mammals [Colowick, S.P., in The Enzymes, Vol. 9 (P. Boyer, ed.) Academic Press, New York, NY, pages 1-48, 1973]. The hexokinases catalyze the first step in the metabolism of glucose, i.e., the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase has a limited cellular distribution, being found principally in pancreatic (_)-cells and liver parenchymal cells. In addition, GK is a rate-controlling enzyme for glucose metabolism in these two cell types that are known to play critical roles in whole-body glucose homeostasis [Chipkin, S.R., Kelly, K.L., and Ruderman, N.B. in Joslin 's Diabetes (C.R. Khan and G.C. Wier, eds.), Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, PA, pages 97-115, 1994]. The concentration of glucose at which GK demonstrates half-maximal activity is approximately 8 mM. The other three hexokinases are saturated with glucose at much lower concentrations (
[0002] The finding that type II maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY-2) is caused by loss of function mutations in the GK gene suggests that GK also functions as a glucose sensor in humans (Liang, Y., Kesavan, P., Wang, L. et al., Biochem. J. 309, 167-173, 1995).   Additional evidence supporting an important role for GK in the regulation of<br><br>
glucose metabolism in humans was provided by the identification of patients that express a mutant form of GK with increased enzymatic activity. These patients exhibit a fasting hypoglycemia associated with an inappropriately elevated level of plasma insulin (Glaser, B., Kesavan, P., Heyman, M. et al., New England J. Med. 338, 226-230, 1998). While mutations of the GK gene are not found in the majority of patients with type II diabetes, compounds that activate GK, and thereby increase the sensitivity of the GK sensor system, will still be useful in the treatment of the hyperglycemia characteristic of all type II diabetes. Glucokinase activators will increase the flux of glucose metabolism in (3-cells and hepatocytes, which will be coupled to increased insulin secretion. Such agents would be useful for treating type II diabetes.<br>

[00046]	The carboxylic acids of formula V wherein R2 is hydrogen and R20 is<br>
mercapto [4-(mercapto)phenylacetic acid], methylthio [4-(methylthio)phenylacetic acid], or methylsulfonyl [4-(methylsulfonyl)phenylacetic acid] are commercially available. The carboxylic acid of formula V wherein R2 is trifluoromethyl and R20 is fluoro [4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetic acid], and the carboxylic acid of formula V wherein R2 is nitro and R is chloro [4-chloro-3-nitrophenyl acetic acid] are also commercially available. If necessary for further chemical modification to produce the desired substitutions at R and R , the carboxylic acids can be converted to the corresponding esters of lower alkyl alcohols using any conventional esterification methods.<br>
[00047]	The reactions hereto forward are to be carried out on the lower alkyl esters<br>
of the carboxylic acids of formula VI or VIII or may be carried out on the carboxylic acids of formula V or DC themselves.<br>
[00048]	If it is desired to produce compounds of formula V where R2 is hydrogen<br>
and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl, the known 4~(mercapto)phenylacetic acid can be used as a starting material. The compound of formula V where R is hydrogen and R is mercapto can be alkylated by conventional methods (for example, with a lower alkyl halide) to the corresponding lower alkyl thio compounds of formula V. The lower alkyl thio compounds can then be converted to the corresponding lower alkyl sulfonyl compounds of formula V by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[00049]	If it is desired to produce compounds of formula V where R is halo and<br>
R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl, the known 2-halothiophenols can be used as starting materials. In this reaction sequence, the mercapto group can be alkylated by conventional methods (for example, with a lower alkyl halide) to the corresponding 2-halo-l-lower alkyl thio benzenes.   These compounds can then be converted to the corresponding 3-<br><br>
halo-4-(lower alkyl thio)-phenyl acetic acids. First, the 2-halo-l-lower alkyi thio benzenes can be acylated with a (lower alkyl)oxalyl chloride (such as methyloxalyl chloride or ethyloxalyl chloride) via a Friedel-Crafts acylation to produce the alpha-keto carboxylic ester in the position para to the lower alkyl thio functional group. The alpha-keto carboxylic ester can then be hydrolyzed by any conventional method for converting an alpha-keto carboxylic ester to an alpha-keto carboxylic acid. Wolff-Kishner reduction of the resulting alpha-keto carboxylic acid will produce the compounds of formula V where R2 is halo and R20 is lower alkyl thio (see for example, J. Med. Chem. 1972, 75, 1029-1032 for a similar reaction sequence). The lower alkyl thio compounds can then be converted to the corresponding lower alkyl sulfonyl compounds of formula V by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[00050]	On the other hand, if it is desired to produce the compounds of formula V<br>
where R is bromo and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl, the compounds wherein R is hydrogen and R~ is lower alkyl thio, compounds produced as described above, can also be used as starting materials. The phenyl acetic acid derivatives of formula V wherein R is hydrogen and R is lower alkyl thio can be brominated. Any conventional method of aromatic bromination can be utilized to effect this conversion (/. MecL Chem. 1989, 52, 2493-2500). Once the compounds of formula V where R is bromo and R is lower alkyl thio are available, they can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula V where R is bromo and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[00051]	If it is desired to produce the compounds of formula V where R2 is cyano<br>
and R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl, these compounds can be prepared as described hereinbefore from compounds where R2 is bromo and R" is lower alkyl sulfonyl. Any conventional method for the nucleophilic displacement of an aromatic bromo substituent with a cyano group transferring agent [such as copper(I) cyanide] can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br><br>
[00052]	If it is desired to produce the compounds of formula V wherein R2 is nitro<br>
and R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl, the known 4-chloro-3-nitrophenyl acetic acid can be used as starting material. This compound can be converted to the compounds of formula V wherein R is nitro and R is lower alkyl thio. Any conventional method for the nucleophilic displacement of an aromatic chlorine group with a lower alkyl thiol can be utilized to effect this conversion (Synthesis 1983, 751-755). Once the compounds of formula V wherein R is nitro and R is lower alkyl thio are available, they can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula V wherein R is nitro and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion. On the other hand, if it is desired to directly produce the compounds of formula V wherein R is nitro and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl from the compound of formula V where R is nitro and R is chloro, any conventional method for the nucleophilic displacement of an aromatic chlorine group with a lower alkane sulfinate (such as sodium methane sulfinate) can be utilized to effect this conversion (J. Org. Chem., 1989, 54, 4691-4692).<br>
[00053]	If it is desired to produce the compounds of formula V where R is fluoro<br>
and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl, these compounds can be alternatively prepared from the aforementioned compounds where R is nitro and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl. The aromatic nitro substituent is first converted to the aromatic ammo group. Any conventional method for the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group can be utilized to effect this conversion. The amino group can then be converted to the fluorine group to produce the compounds of formula V where R is fluoro and R is lower alkyl sulfonyl. Any conventional method for converting an aromatic amino group to an aromatic fluorine can be utilized to effect this conversion (Synthetic Common. 1992, 22, 73-82; J. Fluorine Chem. 1991, 57,299-304).<br>
[00054]	On the other hand, if it is desired to produce the compounds of formula V<br>
where R2 is trifluoromethyl and R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl, the known 4-fluoro-3-<br><br>
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetic acid can be used as a starting material. In this reaction, any conventional method for the nucleophilic displacement of an aromatic fluorine group with a lower alkyl thiol can be utilized to effect this conversion (J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 6592-6594; J. Org. Chem. 1982, 47, 4341-4344). Once the compounds of formula V where R is trifluoromethyl and R~ is lower alkyl thio are available, they can be converted to the corresponding compounds of formula V where R is trifluoromethyl and R   is lower alkyl sulfonyl using conventional oxidation procedures.<br>
[00055]	If it is desired to produce compounds of formula V where R2 is methyl and<br>

Next, the 5-[fluoro]heteroaromatic-2-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester can then be converted to the compounds of formula X wherein R4 is a tert-butyl carboxylate substituent.

Deprotection of the benzyl ethers under standard hydrogenation conditions can provide the desired compounds of formula I wherein R4 is a (bis-hydroxymethyl)methoxy substituent.<br><br>
[000107] The compounds of formula I have an asymmetric carbon atom through which the group -CH2R3 and the amide substituents are connected. In accordance with this invention, the preferred stereoconfiguration at this carbon is "R."<br>
[000108] If it is desired to produce the R isomer or the S isomer of the compounds of formula I, these compounds can be isolated as the desired isomer by conventional chemical means. The preferred chemical mean is the use of pseudoephredrine as a chiral auxiliary for the asymmetric alkylation of the phenylacetic acids of formula V (Jl Am. Chenu Soc. 1991, 119, 6496-6511). To form the desired R acids of formula IX, the compounds of formula V where R is lower alkyl thio and R is as described above are first converted to the pseudoephedrine amides using lR,2R~(-)-pseudoephedrine as the desired enantiomer of pseudoephedrine. Any conventional method for converting a carboxylic acid to a carboxamide can be utilized to effect this conversion. The pseudoephedrine amides can undergo highly diastereoselective alkylations with alkyl halides to afford the a-substituted amide products corresponding to formula DC. These highly diastereomerically enriched amides can be converted to the highly enantiomerically enriched R carboxylic acids of formula DC where R is lower alkyl thio and R is as described above by conventional acidic hydrolysis methods for converting a carboxamide to a carboxylic acid. These R carboxylic acids of formula IX where R20 is lower alkyl thio and R" is as described above can be converted to the R isomers of formula I where R is lower alkyl thio and R is as described above. In carrying out this reaction, any conventional method of condensing a primary amine with a carboxylic acid, without racemization, can be utilized to effect this conversion. Once the compounds of formula I where R is lower alkyl thio and R is as described above are available, they can be converted to the corresponding R compounds of formula I where R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl and R is as described above by oxidation. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[000109] On the other hand, the R carboxylic acids of formula DC where R20 is lower alkyl thio and R2 is as described above can first be oxidized to the R compounds of<br><br>
formula IX where R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl and R2 is as described above. Any conventional method of oxidizing an alkyl thio substituent to the corresponding sulfone group can be utilized to effect this conversion. These compounds can be then converted to the corresponding R compounds of formula I where R20 is lower alkyl sulfonyl and R2 is as described above. In carrying out this reaction, any conventional method of condensing a primary amine with a carboxylic acid, without racemization, can be utilized to effect this conversion.<br>
[000110] Another chemical means to produce the R or S isomer of the compounds of formula I is to react the compound of formula IX with an optically active base. Any conventional optically active base can be utilized to carry out this resolution. Among the preferred optically active bases are the optically active amine bases such as alpha-rnethylbenzylamine, quinine, dehydroabietylamine, and alpha-methylnaphthylamine. Any of the conventional techniques utilized in resolving organic acids with optically active organic amine bases can be utilized in carrying out this reaction. In the resolution step, the compound of formula IX is reacted with the optically active base in an inert organic solvent medium to produce salts of the optically active amine with both the R and S isomers of the compound of foimula DC In the formation of these salts, temperatures and pressure are not critical and the salt formation can take place at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The R and S salts can be separated by any conventional method such as fractional crystallization. After crystallization, each of the salts can be converted to the respective compounds of formula IX in the R and S configuration by hydrolysis with an acid. Among the preferred acids are dilute aqueous acids, i.e., from about 0.001N to 2N aqueous acids, such as aqueous sulfuric or aqueous hydrochloric acid. The configuration of formula IX which is produced by this method of resolution is carried out throughout the entire reaction scheme to produce the desired R or S isomers of formula I.<br>
[000111] The resolution of racemates of the compounds of the formula IX can also be achieved via the formation of corresponding diastereomeric esters or amides. These diastereomeric esters or amides can be prepared by coupling the carboxylic acids of the formula IX with a chiral alcohol or a chiral amine. This reaction can be carried out using<br><br>
any conventional method of coupling a carboxylic acid with an alcohol or an amine. The corresponding diastereomers of compounds of the formula DC can then be separated using any conventional separation methods. The resulting pure diastereomeric esters or amides can then be hydrolyzed to yield the corresponding pure R or S isomers. The hydrolysis reaction can be carried out using conventional known methods to hydrolyze an ester or an amide without racemization. Finally, the separation of R and S isomers can also be achieved using an enzymatic ester hydrolysis of any lower alkyl esters corresponding to the compound of the formula VIII {Tetrahedron Lett 1989, 30, 7053-7056), which results in the formation of corresponding chiral acid and chiral ester. The ester and the acid can be separated by any conventional method of separating an acid from an ester. The configuration of formula VIII which is produced by this method of resolution is carried out throughout the entire reaction scheme to produce the desired R or S isomers of formula I.<br>
[000112] The resolution of racemates of the compounds of the formula IX can also be achieved via the formation of corresponding diastereomeric esters or amides.

This reaction can be carried out using any conventional method of coupling a carboxylic acid with an alcohol or an amine. The corresponding diastereomers of compounds of the formula IX can then be separated using any conventional separation methods.

Biological Activity<br>
Example A:   In Vitro Glucokinase Activity<br>
[000362] Glucokinase In Vitro Assay Protocol: Glucokinase (GK) was assayed by coupling the production of glucose-6-phosphate to the generation of NADH with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, 0,75-1 kunits/mg; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides as the coupling enzyme (Scheme 2).<br><br>
[000363] Recombinant human liver GK1 was expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-GK) [Liang et al, 1995] and was purified by chromatography over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column using the procedure provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic properties of native GK and GST-GK are essentially identical (Liang et al, 1995; Neet et al., 1990).<br>
[000364] The assay was conducted at 25Â°C in a flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plate from Costar (Cambridge, MA) with a final incubation volume of 120 pL. The incubation mixture contained the following: 25 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.1), 25 mM KC1, 5 mM D-glucose, lmM ATP, 1.8 mM NAD, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 (+)M sorbitol-6-phosphate5 1 mM dithiothreitol, test drug or 10% DMSO, 1.8 unit/ml G6PDH, and GK (see below). All organic reagents were &gt;98% pure and were from Boehringer Mannheim with the<br><br>
exceptions of D-glucose and Hepes which were from Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and were added to the incubation mixture minus GST-GK in a volume of 12 (+)L to yield a final DMSO concentration of 10%. This mix was pre-incubated in the temperature controlled chamber of a SPECTRAmax 250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) for 10 minutes to allow temperature equilibrium and then the reaction was started by the addition of 20 (+)L GST-GK.<br>
[000365] After addition of enzyme, the increase in optical density (OD) at 340 nm was monitored over a 10 minute incubation period as a measure of GK activity. Sufficient GST-GK was added to produce an increase in OD34o of 0.08 to 0.1 units over the 10 minute incubation period in wells containing 10% DMSO but no test compound. Preliminary experiments established that the GK reaction was linear over this period of time even in the presence of activators that produced a 5-fold increase in GK activity. The GK activity in control wells was compared with the activity in wells containing test GK activators, and the concentration of activator that produced a 50% increase in the activity of GK, i.e., the SC1.5, was calculated. All of the compounds of formula I described in the Synthesis Examples had an SC1.5 less than or equal to 100 ^iM.<br>

Immediately prior to dosing, a pre dose (time zero) blood glucose reading is acquired by snipping off a small portion of the animals tail (-lmm) and collecting 15jaL blood into a heparinized capillary tube for analysis. Following GK activator administration, additional blood glucose readings are taken at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post dose from the same tail wound. Results are interpreted by comparing the mean blood glucose values of six vehicle treated mice with six GK activator treated mice over the six hour study duration. Preferred compounds are considered to be those that exhibit a statistically significant (p
