1-(Azolin-2-yl)amino-1,2-diphenylethane compounds for combating insects, arachnids and nematodes<br>
The present invention relates to 1-(azoiin-2-yl)amino-1,2-diphenylethane compounds which are useful for combating insects, arachnids and nematodes. The present invention also relates to a method for combating animal pests selected from insects, arachnids and nematodes, and to agricultural compositions for combating animal pests.<br>
Animal pests and in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating insects, arachnids and nematodes.<br>
Jennings et al. Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology 30, 1988, p. 190-197 describe several 2-phenyiamino oxazolines and 2-benzylamino oxazolines which have insecti-cidal activity. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992, 56 (7), 1062-1065 discloses phenyl-, benzyl- und phenethyl thiazolines having insecticidal activity. However, these compounds are limited in their activity or with regard to breadth of their activity spectrum.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be e.g. prepared from the corresponding diphenylethylamines II by the synthetic routes outlined in schemes 1 and 2. Compounds of the formula I, wherein A is a radical A2 with X being S and R7 being H can be obtained according to the method outlined in scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1:<br><br><br>
According to the method outlined in scheme 1, a 1,2-diphenylaminoethane il is converted into the corresponding isothiocyanate III by conventional means, e.g. by reacting II with thiophosgene (see e.g. Houben-Weyl, E4, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie", chapter lllc, pp. 837-842. The isothiocyanate III is then reacted with an ami-noethanol of the general formula IV, thereby obtaining the thiourea compound of the formula V. The reaction of the aminoethanol IV with isothiocyanate III can be performed in accordance with standard methods of organic chemistry, see e.g. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992, 56 (7), 1062-1065.<br>
The thus obtained thioureas can be cyclized by conventional means thereby obtaining the desired thiazoline compound of the formula I, wherein A is A2 with X being S and R7 being H. Cyclization of compound V can be achieved e.g. under acid catalysis or under dehydrating conditions e.g. by Mitsunobu's reaction (see Tetrahedron Let-ters1999, 40, 3125-3128).<br>
Compounds of the formula I, wherein A is a radical A2 with X being O and R7 being H can be obtained by a route similar to the method outlined in scheme 1 (see also Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1988, 30, 190-197). Unlike the method of scheme I diphenylamino-<br><br>
ethane II is converted into the corresponding isocyanate Ilia, e.g. by reaction with phosgen, diphosgen or another phosgene equivalent. The isocyante Ilia is then reacted with aminoethanol IV and the thus obtained urea is cyclized.<br>
Compounds of the formula I, wherein A is a radical of the formula A2 with X being O and R7 being H can also be obtained by the method outlined in scheme 2. In scheme 2 the variable Hal is halogen, especially chlorine. Y is OH or halogen. Z is hydrogen, alkyl or halogen, especially fluorine.<br><br>
According to scheme 2, diphenylaminoethanes are converted into the corresponding carbamates of the formula VII by reacting II with a phenyl chloroformate such as 4-chlorophenyl chloroformat according to standard methods (see e.g. Pesticide Bio-<br><br>
chemistry and Physiology 30, 1988, p. 190-197). The thus obtained carbamate VII is reacted with the aminoalkohot IV in the presence of trimethylchlorosilane according to the method described in J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 8515-8521. Thereby, 2-hydroxyethyl ureas of the formula Va {Y = OH} are obtained. The 2-hydroxyethylureas can be cy-clized to the oxazoline compounds I according to the procedures described in Org. Lett. 1999, 1, 1705-1708 or Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 2807-2810.<br>
Alternatively, substituted 2-chloroethyl ureas Va {X = CI} can be cyclized according to the methods described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994, 4, 2317-2322 or under the conditions described below. Chloroethyl ureas Va can be obtained from the corresponding diphenylethylamines II by reacting II with 2-Chloroethylisocyanate VIII.<br>

In order to obtain compounds of the formual I, wherein R6 or R7 is C^Ce-alkyloxycarbonyl or CrC6-alkylthiocarbonyl, the starting material is reacted with a suitable haloformiate of the formula Rb-C(0)-Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, especially chlorine and wherein Rb is CrCe-alkyloxy or CrCe-alkylthio. The reaction can be performed by routine methods described in standard textbooks on organic synthesis, see e.g. J. March, Advanced Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley and Sons..<br>
The cyano group can be introduced as a radical R6 or R7e.g. by reaction of the starting material with bromocyan according to the methods described in the experimental part of the present application. The introduction of nitro groups as radicals R6 or R7 can be performed by reacting compounds I with R6 or R7 being H with nitronium source according to standard methods well known in the art.<br>
The group (S02)NRaRb can be introduced as a radical R6 or R7 e.g. by reacting the starting material with the chlorosulfonamide CI-(S02)NRaRb according to routine methods described in standard textbooks on organic synthesis, see e.g. J. March, Advanced Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley and Sons.<br><br>
The group C(0)NRaRb can be introduced as a radical R6 or R7 e.g. by reacting the starting material with the chloroformamide CI-CO-NRaRb or by reaction with isocy-anates OCN-Ra for Rb being hydrogen.<br>
Diphenylethylamines of the formula II are known in the art (e.g. 1,2-diphenylethylamine, CAS-Nr.[ 3082-58-4]) or they can be prepared by methods familiar to an Organic chemist and well known in the art.

The compounds of formula (I) or the pesticidai compositions comprising them may be used to protect growing plants and crops from attack or infestation by animal pests, especially insects, acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant/crop with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula (I). The term "crop" refers both to growing and harvested crops.<br>
The animal pest, i.e. the insects, arachnids, and nematodes, the plant, soil or water in which the plant is growing can be contacted with the present compound(s) I or compositions) containing them by any application method known in the art. As such, "contacting" includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions directly on the animal pest or plant - typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the animal pest or plant).<br>
Moreover, animal pests may be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food supply or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula (I). As such, the application may be carried out before or after the infection of the locus, growing crops, or harvested crops by the pest.<br>
"Locus" means a habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.<br>
Effective amounts suitable for use in the method of invention may vary depending upon the particular formula I compound, target pest, method of application, application timing, weather conditions, animal pest habitat, or the like.
