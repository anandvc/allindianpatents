				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The system consists of the filling interlock micro switch which is mounted on the filling nozzle. The said micro switch is mounted in such a way that when the filling dispenser tube is inserted in the filling nozzle, the micro switch contact opens and provides open circuit in the electrical circuit and because of this starter interlock relay will be kept open. So engine cannot be cranked. The said starter interlock relay will also be deactivated by said ECU if the engine is in running or idling condition. Thus starter interlock relay will be deactivated (i.e. opened) if engine is in running / idling or gas is filling. While said micro switch is open and if the engine is in Idling or Running position then the said actuator power relay will be opened which cut off power supply to fuel lock off solenoid. Hence the engine will stop automatically if someone tries to fill the gas while engine is in running or idling position. This invention interfaces gas filling with cranking and switching off of engine. The advantage of the invention is that it automatically switches off the running engine during fuel filling and also if the engine is already off &amp; gas is being filled in, then if somebody tries to crank the engine, then it disables cranking &amp; starting of the engine.

 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to safety features of commercial and passenger vehicles which run on the Gaseous and Liquid Alternate fuels (CNG / LPG / Hydrogen &amp; combinations of these) which uses gas tanks as fuel storage and more particularly it relates to anti cranking system for vehicles with gaseous and liquid alternate fuels during filling of the fuel in the storage tank in filling stations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Generally the alternate fuel like CNG is the natural gas which is compressed using compressor and stored in the filling station of the gas. The said gas is dispensed into the vehicle storage tanks using a dispenser nozzle at various filling pressures depending on the country and the types of fuel being used in the vehicles. Since the fuel is highly pressurized, there are safety requirements that the vehicle should be switched off during the filling of the gas in the vehicle. There is a possibility of fire hazard at the filling station if the vehicle is not switched off intentionally or unknowingly during the filling of the gas.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide anti -cranking system for vehicles with gaseous and liquid alternate fuels which automatically switches off the running engine if fuel filling is attempted while the engine is running.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide anti -cranking system for vehicles with gaseous and liquid alternate fuels which disables the cranking and starting of the engine while fuel is being filled.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the  drawings wherein the  showings  are  for the  purpose  of<br>
illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of<br>
limiting the same.<br>
Now referring to figure-01 to 03,In accordance with the present invention, "Fuel<br>
Filling safety interlock for Alternate fuel vehicles" with gaseous and liquid alternate<br>
fuels comprises; ECU (1) for monitoring the Engine RPM, Engine speed sensor (2)<br>
which detects the Rpm of the said Engine, start interlock micro switch (3) which<br>
detects fuel filling dispenser coupled with the filling nozzle and / or opening of the<br>
cover on fuel filling adaptor , starter interlock relay (4), actuator relay (5), key switch<br>
(6) for starter signal, starter solenoid (7), fuel lock off solenoid (8), battery (9) for<br>
power supply, wherein said ECU (1) is interfaced with said starter interlock relay (4),<br>
said actuator relay (5), said battery (9) and ground (17).<br>
Said ECU (1) is interfaced with said starter interlock relay (4) with the help of starter<br>
relay control (26).<br>
Said ECU (1) is interfaced with said actuator relay (5) with the help of actuator power<br>
relay diagnostic feedback (23) and actuator relay control (25).<br>
Said ECU (1) is interfaced with said battery (9) with the help of line (28) ,<br>
Also said ECU (1) is interfaced with ground (17).<br>
Said starter relay (4) having key switch (6) for starter signal to be interfaced to starter<br>
solenoid (7).<br>
Said start interlock micro switch (3) is interfaced with said starter interlock relay (4)<br>
through the connection lines (19, 21) and with said actuator relay (5) though<br>
connection lines (19, 20 and 18, 22).<br>
Negative terminal and positive terminal of said fuel lock off solenoid (8) is interfaced<br>
with ground (17) and with actuator power relay   contact diagnostic feedback (23)<br>
respectively.<br>
 <br>
Referring to figure-01, said starter interlock relay (4) and actuator power relay (5) is controlled with the help of the gas filling engine start interlock micro switch (3). When the said micro switch (3) is open then the said starter interlock relay (4) will be opened and thus no power supply to the said starter solenoid (7). During the engine is in running or idling position if the said micro switch (3) is kept open i.e. the gas is being filling then the said actuator relay (5) will be opened and the power supply to the said fuel lock off solenoid (8) will be cut off enabling the running engine to be switched OFF.<br>
Referring to figure-02, the said ECU (1) continuously checks the rpm of the engine with the help of said Engine Speed Sensor (2). If the rpm of said engine is greater than the minimum speed which is Cranking or Idling or Running speed of engine and if the said micro switch (3) at fitting nozzie is opened, then power supply to the fuel lock off solenoid (8) will be cut off by said ECU (1) thereby avoiding the fuel supply to the combustion chamber and automatically stopping the engine of the vehicle. In case the engine is standstill or not running and said micro switch (3) at the filling nozzle is opened, i.e. fuel is being filled, since during the fuel filling the said starter interlock relay (4) is open which disables the cranking of the standstill engine. Thus preventing the cranking of the engine during fuel filling.<br>
Referring now to figure-03, when the said micro switch (3) is closed the power supply from said battery (9) will be given to said actuator power relay (5) through the connection line (18,19,20) and to Starter interlock relay (4) through connection line (19, 21). Thus the said starter interlock relay (4) will be activated (i.e. closed) if said ECU (1) gives low output to said starter relay control (26). The said starter relay control (26) will be in low state only when engine is in standstill position.<br>
 <br>
Similarly said actuator power relay (5) will also be activated if ECU (1) gives low output to said actuator power relay control (25).<br>
In the fuel lock off solenoid (8) negative terminal is connected with ground (17) and positive terminal (24) is connected with said actuator power relay diagnostic feedback (23). Thus when actuator relay (5) is closed, the positive terminal (24) of said fuel lock off solenoid (8) is connected to said actuator power relay diagnostic feedback( 23) and then to said Battery (9) through line(22).<br>
When the said micro switch (3) is opened, there is no connection between line (18) and line(19). Hence said actuator power relay (5) and Starter interlock relay (4) will remain open i.e. no fuel supply to combustion chamber and deactivate the cranking of engine. Thus engine will remain in standstill position if gas is being filled in gas storage tank.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
