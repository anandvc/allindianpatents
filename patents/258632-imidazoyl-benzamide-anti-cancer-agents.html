				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60/569,510,<br>
filed May 6,2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to chemical entities which are inhibitors of one or more<br>
mitotic kinesins and are useful in the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases, for example<br>
cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders, fungal disorders, and<br>
inflammation.<br>
[0003]	Among the therapeutic agents used to treat cancer are the taxanes and vinca<br>
alkaloids, which act on microtubules. Microtubules are the primary structural element of the<br>
mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is responsible for distribution of replicate copies of the<br>
genome to each of the two daughter cells that result from cell division. It is presumed that<br>
disruption of the mitotic spindle by these drugs results in inhibition of cancer cell division,<br>
and induction of cancer cell death. However, microtubules form other types of cellular<br>
structures, including tracks for intracellular transport in nerve processes. Because these<br>
agents do not specifically target mitotic spindles, they have side effects that limit their<br>
usefulness.<br>
[0004]	Improvements in the specificity of agents used to treat cancer is of<br>
considerable interest because of the therapeutic benefits which would be realized if the side<br>
effects associated with the administration of these agents could be reduced. Traditionally,<br>
dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer are associated with identification of<br>
therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples of this include not only the<br>
taxanes, but also the camptothecin class of tppoisomerase I inhibitors. From both of these<br>
perspectives, mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for new anti-cancer agents.<br>
[0005]	Mitotic kinesins are enzymes essential for assembly and function of the mitotic<br>
spindle, but are not generally part of other microtubule structures, such as in nerve processes.<br>
Mitotic kinesins play essential roles during all phases of mitosis. These enzymes are<br>
"molecular motors" that transform energy released by hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical<br>
force which drives the directional movement of cellular cargoes along microtubules. The<br>
catalytic domain sufficient for this task is a compact structure of approximately 340 amino<br>
acids. During mitosis, kinesins organize microtubules into the bipolar structure that is the<br>
mitotic spindle. Kinesins mediate movement of chromosomes along spindle microtubules, as<br>
well as structural changes in the mitotic spindle associated with specific phases of mitosis.<br><br>
L. perimental perturbation of mitotic kinesin function causes malformation or dysfunction of<br>
the mitotic spindle, frequently resulting in cell cycle arrest and cell death.<br>
[0006]	In one aspect, the invention relates to methods for treating cellular<br>
proliferative diseases, and for treating disorders by inhibiting the activity of one or more<br>
mitotic kinesins.<br>

point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -CONH2 is attached through the carbon<br>
atom.<br>
[0026]	By "optional" or "optionally" is meant that the subsequently described event or<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the<br>
event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally<br>
substituted alkyl" encompasses both "alkyl" and "substituted alkyl" as defined below. It will<br>
be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more<br>
substiruents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution<br>
patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable.<br>
[0027]	"Alkyl" encompasses straight chain and branched chain having the indicated<br>
number of carbon atoms, usually from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, for example 1 to 8 carbon atoms,<br>
such as 1 to 6 carbon atoms. For example C1-C6alkyl encompasses both straight and<br>

and heteroeycloalkyl are as described herein. Acyl groups have the indicated number of<br>
carbon atoms, with the carbon of the keto group being included in the numbered carbon<br>
atoms. For example a C2 acyl group is an acetyl group having the formula CH3(K*I=O)-.<br>
[0031]	By "alkoxycarbonyl" is meant an ester group of the formula (alkoxy)(K*I=O)-<br>
attached through the carbonyl carbon wherein the alkoxy group has the indicated number of<br>

[0034]	"Aryl" encompasses:<br>
5- and 6-membered carbocyclic aromatic rings, for example, benzene;<br>
bicyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for<br>
example, naphthalene, indane, and tetralin; and<br>
tricyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for<br>
example, fluorene.<br>
For example, aryl includes 5- and 6-membered carbocyclic aromatic rings fused to a 5- to 7-<br>
membered heterocycloalkyl ring containing 1 or more heteroatoms chosen from N, O, and S.<br>
For such fused, bicyclic ring systems wherein only one of the rings is a carbocyclic aromatic<br>
ring, the point of attachment may be at the carbocyclic aromatic ring or the heterocycloalkyl<br>
ring. Bivalent radicals formed from substituted benzene derivatives and having the free<br>
valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals. Bivalent radicals derived<br>
from univalent polycyclic hydrocarbon radicals whose names end in "-yl" by removal of one<br>
hydrogen atom from the carbon atom with the free valence are named by adding "-idene" to<br>
the name of the corresponding univalent radical, e.K*i., a naphthyl group with two points of<br>
attachment is termed naphthylidene. Aryl, however, does not encompass or overlap in any<br>
way with heteroaryl, separately defined below. Hence, if one or more carbocyclic aromatic<br>
rings is fused with a heterocycloalkyl aromatic ring, the resulting ring system is heteroaryl,<br>
not aryl, as defined herein.<br>
[0035]	The term "aryloxy" refers to the group -O-aryl.<br>
[0036]	The term "aralkyl" refers to a residue in which an aryl moiety is attached to the<br>
parent structure via an alkyl residue. Examples include benzyl-, phenethyl-, phenylvinyl-,<br>
phenylallyl and the like.<br>
[0037]	The term "heteroaralkyl" refers to a residue in which a heteroaryl moiety is<br>
attached to the parent structure via an alkyl residue. Examples include furanylmethyl-,<br>
pyridinylmethyl-, pyrimidinyleth} 1 and the like.<br><br>
[0038]	The term "halo" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo, and the term<br>
"halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.<br>
[0039]	"Haloalkyl" indicates alkyl as defined above having the specified number of<br>
carbon atoms, substituted with 1 or more halogen atoms, up to the maximum allowable<br>
number of halogen atoms. Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to,<br>
trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, and penta-fluoroethyl.<br>
[0040]	"Heteroaryl",encompasses:	<br>
5- to 7-membered aromatic, monocyclic rings containing one or more, for example,<br>
from 1 to 4, or in certain embodiments, from 1 to 3, heteroatoms chosen from<br>
N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon; and<br>
bicyclic heterocycloalkyl rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 4, or in<br>
certain embodiments, from 1 to 3, heteroatoms chosen from N, O, and S, with<br>
the remaining ring atoms being carbon and whereinat least one heteroatom is<br>
present in an aromatic ring.<br>
For example, heteroaryl includes a 5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl, aromatic ring fused to<br>
a 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl ring. For such fused, bicyclic heteroaryl ring systems wherein<br>
only one of the rings contains one or more heteroatoms, the point of attachment may be at the<br>
heteroaromatic ring or the cycloalkyl ring. When the total number of S and O atoms in the<br>
heteroaryl group exceeds 1, those heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In certain<br>
embodiments, the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group is not more than 2.<br>
In certain embodiments, the total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not<br>
more than 1. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, (as numbered<br>
from the linkage position assigned priority 1), 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2,3-pyrazinyl,<br>
3,4-pyrazinyl, 2,4-pyrimidinyl, 3,5-pyrimidinyl, 2,3-pyrazolinyl, 2,4-imidazolinyl,<br>
isoxazolinyl, oxazolinyl, thiazolinyl, thiadiazolinyl, tetrazolyl, thienyl, benzothiophenyl,<br>
furanyl, benzofuranyl, benzoimidazolinyl, indolinyl, pyridizinyl, triazolyl, quinolinyl,<br>
pyrazolyl, imidazopyridinyl, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline. Bivalent radicals derived<br>
from univalent heteroaryl radicals whose names end in "-yl" by removal of one hydrogen<br>
atom from the atom with the free valence are named by adding "-idene" to the name of the<br>
corresponding univalent radical, e.K*i., a pyridyl group with two points of attachment is a<br>
pyridylidene. Heteroaryl does not encompass or overlap with aryl as defined above.<br>
[0041]	In the term "heteroaralkyl," heteroaryl and alkyl are as defined herein, and the<br>
point of attachment is on the alkyl group. This term encompasses, but is not limited to,<br><br>
pyridylmethyl, thiophenylmethyl, and (pyrrolyl)1-ethyl.<br>
[0042]	A "leaving group" or "atom" is any group or atom that will, under the reaction<br>
conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site.<br>
Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-<br>
nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups.<br>
[0043]	"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said<br>
event or circumstances occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally<br>
substituted alkyl" includes "alkyl" and "substituted alkyl" as defined herein. It will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more<br>
substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution<br>
patterns that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently<br>
unstable.<br>
[0044]	"Protecting group" has the meaning conventionally associated with it in<br>
organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a<br>
multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on<br>
another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the<br>
selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in<br>
T.H. Greene and P. K*I. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
For example, a hydroxyl protected form is where at least one of the hydroxyl groups present<br>
in a compound is protected with a hydroxyl protecting group. Likewise, amines and other<br>
reactive groups may similarly be protected.<br>
[0045]	By "heterocycloalkyl" is meant a single aliphatic ring, usually with 3 to 7 ring<br>
atoms, containing at least 2 carbon atoms in addition to 1-3 heteroatoms independently<br>
selected from oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, as well as combinations comprising at least one of<br>
the foregoing heteroatoms. Suitable heterocycloalkyl groups include, for example (as<br>
numbered from the linkage position assigned priority 1), 2-pyrrolinyl, 2,4-imidazolidinyl, 2,3-<br>
pyrazolidinyl, 2-piperidyl, 3-piperidyl, 4-piperdyl, and 2,5-piperzinyl. Morpholinyl groups<br>
are also contemplated, including 2-morpholinyl and 3-morpholinyl (numbered wherein the<br>
oxygen is assigned priority 1).<br>
[0046]	As used herein, "modulation" refers to a change in CENP-E activity as a direct<br>
or indirect response to the presence at least one chemical entity described herein, relative to<br><br>
the activity of CENP-E in the absence of the chemical entity. The change may be an increase<br>
in activity or a decrease in activity, and may be due to the direct interaction of the chemical<br>
entity with CENP-E, or due to the interaction of the compound with one or more other factors<br>
that in turn affect CENP-E activity.<br>
[0047]	The term "sulfanyl" includes the groups: -S-( optionally substituted (C1-<br>
C6)alkyl), -S-(optionalIy substituted aryl), -S-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and<br>
-S-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyi). Hence, sulfanyl includes the group C1-C6<br>
alkylsulfanyl.<br>
{0048]	The term "sulfinyl" includes the groups: -S(O)-H, -S(O)-( optionally<br>
substituted (C1-C6)alkyl), -S(O)-optionally substituted aryl), -S(O)-optionally substituted<br>
heteroaryl), -S(O)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyi); and -S(O)-(optionally substituted<br>
amino).<br>
[0049]	The term "sulfonyl" includes the groups: -S(O2&gt;H,.-S(O2)-( optionally<br>
substituted (C1-C6)alkyl), -S(O2)-optionally substituted aryl), -S(O2)~optionally substituted<br>
heteroaryl), -S(O2)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyi) ,-S(O2)-(optionally substituted<br>
alkoxy), -S(O2)-optionally substituted aryloxy), -S(O2)-optionally substituted heteroaryloxy),<br>
-S(O2)-(optionally substituted heterocyclyloxy); and -S(O2)-(optionally substituted amino).<br>
[0050]	The term "substituted", as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens<br>
on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group,<br>
provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is<br>
oxo (i.e., =O) then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents<br>
and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or<br>
useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a<br>
compound that'is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and<br>
subsequent formulation as an agent having at least practical utility. Unless otherwise<br>
specified, substituents are named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood<br>
that when (cycloalkyl)alkyl is listed as a possible substituent, the point of attachment of this<br>
substituent to the core structure is in the alkyl portion.<br>
[0051]	The terms "substituted" alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycloalkyi, and<br>
heteroaryl, unless otherwise expressly defined, refer respectively to alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,<br>

[0057]	Compounds of Formula I-XIII include, but are not limited to, optical isomers<br>
of compounds of Formula I-XIII, racemates, and other mixtures thereof. In those situations,<br>
the single enantiomers or diastereomers, i.e., optically active forms, can be obtained by<br>
asymmetric synthesis or by resolution of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can be<br>
accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence<br>
of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral high-pressure liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) column. In addition, compounds of Formula I-XIII include Z- and<br>
E- forms (or cis- and trans- forms) of compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds. Where<br>
compounds of Formula I-XIII exists in various tautomeric forms, chemical entities of the<br>
present invention include all tautomeric forms of the compound. Compounds of Formula I-<br>
XIII also includes crystal forms such as polymorphs and clathrates.<br>
[0058]	Chemical entities of the present invention include, but are not limited to<br>
compounds of Formula I-XIII and all pharmaceutically acceptable forms thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the compounds recited herein include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, solvates, chelates, non-covalent complexes, prodrugs, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts. Hence, the terms "chemical entity" and "chemical entities" also encompass<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, chelates, non-covalent complexes, prodrugs, and<br>
mixtures.<br>
[0059]	"Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" include, but are not limited to salts with<br>
inorganic acids, such as hydrochlorate, phosphate, diphosphate, hydrobromate, sulfate,<br>
sulfinate, nitrate, and like salts; as well as salts with an organic acid, such as malate, maleate,<br><br>
fumarate, tartrate, succinate, citrate, acetate, lactate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, 2-<br>
hydroxyethylsulfonate, benzoate, salicylate, stearate, and alkanoate such as acetate, HOOC-<br>

include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, and<br>
ammonium.<br>
[0060]	In addition, if the compound of Formula I-XIII is obtained as an acid addition<br>
salt, the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of the acid salt* Conversely, if the<br>
product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition<br>
salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the<br>
solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition<br>
salts from base compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic<br>
methodologies that may be used to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition<br>
salts.	'<br>
[0061]	As noted above, prodrugs also fall within the scope of chemical entities, for<br>
example ester or amide derivatives of the compounds of Formula I-XIII. The term "prodrug"<br>
includes any compound that becomes a compound of Formula I-XIII when administered to a<br>
patient, e.K*i., upon metabolic processing of the prodrug. Examples of prodrugs include, but<br>
are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate and like derivatives of functional groups<br>
(such as alcohol or amine groups) in the compounds of Formula I-XIII. In some<br>
embodiments, the prodrug is a phosphate ester. A thorough discussion of prodrugs is<br>
provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the<br>
A.CS. Symposium Series, in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,<br>
American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in Design of Prodrugs,<br>
ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0062 ]	The term "solvate" refers to the chemical entity formed by the interaction of a<br>
solvent and a compound. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, such as<br>
hydrates, including monohydrates and hemi-hydrates.<br>
[0063]	The term "chelate" refers to the chemical entity formed by the coordination of<br>
a compound to a metal ion at two (or more) points.<br>
[0064]	The term "non-covalent complex" refers to the chemical entity formed by the<br>
interaction of a compound and another molecule wherein a covalent bond is not formed<br>
between the compound and the molecule. For example, complexation can occur through van<br>
der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions (also called ionic<br><br>
bonding).<br>
[0065]	The term "active agent" is used to indicate a chemical entity which has<br>
biological activity. In certain embodiments, an "active agent" is a compound having<br>
pharmaceutical utility. For example an active agent may be an anti-cancer therapeutic.<br>
[0066]	The term "antimitotic" refers to a drug for inhibiting or preventing mitosis, for<br>
example, by causing metaphase arrest. Some antitumour drugs block proliferation and are<br>
considered antimitotics.	<br>
[0067]	The term "therapeutically effective amount" of a chemical entity of this<br>
invention means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human patient,<br>
to provide a therapeutic benefit such as amelioration of symptoms, slowing of disease<br>
progression, or prevention of disease e.K*i., a therapeutically effective amount may be an<br>
amount sufficient to decrease the symptoms of a disease responsive to CENP-E inhibition. In<br>
some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to reduce<br>
cancer symptoms. In some embodiments a therapeutically effective amount is an amount<br>
sufficient to decrease the number of detectable cancerous cells in an organism, detectably<br>
slow, or stop the growth of a cancerous tumor. In some embodiments, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount is an amount sufficient to shrink a cancerous tumor.<br>
[0068]	The term "inhibition" indicates a significant decrease in the baseline activity of<br>
a biological activity or process. "Inhibition of CENP-E activity" refers to a decrease in<br>
CENP-E activity as a direct or indirect response to the presence of at least one chemical entity<br>
described herein, relative to the activity of CENP-E in the absence of the at least one<br>
chemical entity. The decrease in activity may be due to the direct interaction of the chemical<br>
entity with CENP-E, or due to the interaction of the chemical entity(ies) described herein with<br>
one or more other factors that in turn affect CENP-E activity. For example, the presence of<br>
the chemical entity(ies) may decrease CENP-E activity by directly binding to CENP-E, by<br>
causing (directly or indirectly) another factor to decrease CENP-E activity, or by (directly or<br>
indirectly) decreasing the amount of CENP-E present in the cell or organism.<br>
[0069]	A "disease responsive to CENP-E inhibition" is a disease in which inhibiting<br>
CENP-E provides a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, decrease in<br>

[0072]	The present invention is directed to a class of novel chemical entities that are<br>
inhibitors of one or more mitotic kinesins. According to some embodiments, the chemical<br>
entities described herein inhibit the mitotic kinesin, CENP-E, particularly human CENP'-E.<br>
CENP-E is a plus end-directed microtubule motor essential for achieving metaphase<br>
chromosome alignment. CENP-E accumulates during interphase and is degraded following<br>
completion of mitosis. Microinjection of antibody directed against CENP-E or<br>
overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of CENP-E causes mitotic arrest with<br>
prometaphase chromosomes scattered on a bipolar spindle. The tail domain of CENP-E<br>
mediates localization to kinetochores and also interacts with the mitotic checkpoint kinase<br>
hBubR1. CENP-E also associates with active forms of MAP kinase. Cloning of human (Yen,<br>
et al., Nature, 359(6395):536-9 (1992)) CENP-E has been reported. In Thrower, et al., EMBO<br>
J., 14:918-26 (1995) partially purified native human CENP-E was reported on. Moreover, the<br>
study reported that CENP-E was a minus end-directed microtubule motor. Wood, et al., Cell,<br>
91:357-66 (1997)) discloses expressed Xenopus CENP-E in E. coli and that XCENP-E has<br>
motility as a plus end directed motor in vitro. CENP-E See, PCT Publication No. WO<br>

[0074]	The methods of inhibiting a mitotic kinesin comprise contacting an inhibitor of<br>
the invention with one or more mitotic kinesin, particularly a human kinesin; or fragments<br>
and valiants thereof. The inhibition can be of the ATP hydrolysis activity of the mitotic<br>
kinesin and/or the mitotic spindle formation activity, such that the mitotic spindles are disrupted.<br>
[0075]	The present invention provides inhibitors of one or more mitotic kinesins, in<br>
particular, one or more human mitotic kinesins, for the treatment of disorders associated with<br>
cell proliferation. The chemical entities compositions and methods described herein can<br>
differ in their selectivity and are used to treat diseases of cellular proliferation, including, but<br>
not limited to cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders, fungal<br>
disorders and inflammation.<br>

stirring for about 2 hours, the product, a compound of Formula 403, is isolated and used<br>
without further purification.<br>
[00130]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 4, Step 2, the hydroxyl group is converted to a<br>
protected amino group. If the protecting group is phthamide, it can be made as follows. To a<br>
stirred solution of a compound of Formula 403 in an inert solvent such as THF are added an<br>
excess (such as about 1.1 equivalents) of isoindole-1.3-dione and triphenylphosphine. An<br>
excess (such as about 1.1 equivalents) of DEAD is then added dropwise and the reaction is<br>
stirred for about 30 min. The product, a compound of Formula 405, is isolated and purified.<br>
[00131]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 4, Step 3, the Boc protecting group is then<br><br>
removed to form the corresponding free amine. One of skill in the art will appreciate that this<br>
should be accomplished in such a manner as to leave the other protected amine intact. For<br>
example, to a solution of a compound of Formula 405 in a nonpolar, aprotic solvent such as<br>
DCM is added an acid, such as TFA, at room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred for<br>
about 20 min. The product, a compound of Formula 407, is isolated and used without further<br>

base such as diisopropylethylamine at room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred<br>
overnight. The product, a compound of Formula 409, is isolated and purified.<br>
[00133]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 4, Step 5, the amine protecting group, PG, is<br>
then removed. If the amine protecting group, PG, is a phthalimide, it can be removed is<br>
follows. To a solution of a compound of Formula 409 in a polar, protic solvent such as<br>
methanol is added an excess (such as about 10 equivalents) of hydrazine hydrate. The<br>

removing other protecting groups are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[00134]	The free amine of a compound of Formula 411 can be acylated, alkylated,<br>
reductively alkylated, or sulfonylated using techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br><br><br><br>

preferred for the compound of Formula I-XIII. For the sake of brevity in the remaining<br>
description of the synthesis of compounds of Formula I-XIII, it should be understood that<br>
either single isomer or a mixture of isomers can be employed to give the corresponding<br>
product.<br>
[00137]	Particular stereoisomers can be obtained from mixtures using techniques<br>
known in the art. For example, some embodiments, a free amine of Formula 605 is dissolved<br>
in an inert organic solvent (such as IP A) and warmed to 60°K*I. In a separate vessel, a<br>
resolving agent (such as dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid) is dissolved, such as in the same warm<br>
solvent, and then quickly added (with agitation) to the warm amine solution. The reaction<br>
mixture is left to crystallize by cooling to room temperature over 16 hours under continuing<br>
agitation. The desired isomer is isolated and purified in the usual manner.<br>
[00138]	In some embodiments, an optically active amine of Formula 607 can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding aryl aldehyde as shown in Reaction Scheme 5.<br>

[00140]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 5, Step 2, to an about 0 °K*I solution of a<br>
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran is<br>
added an excess (such as about 1.2 equivalents) of borane-tetrahydrofuran complex. The<br>
resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for about 15 minutes. A compound of<br>
Formula 603 in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise, and the resulting<br>
solution is refluxed for about 4 hours; The product, a compound of Formula 605, is isolated<br>
and optionally purified.<br>
[00141]	The amine of Formula 605 can be then resolved using techniques known in the<br>
art. For example, a 0 °K*I solution of the amine of Formula 605 in an inert solvent such as<br>
ethyl acetate is saturated with hydrochloric acid (gas). The resulting salt is collected by<br><br>
filtration and dried in vacuo. L-N-Acetylleucine sodium salt is added slowly to a stirred<br>
solution of the aforementioned salt in water. Crystals form overnight and are removed by<br>
filtration, washed with a small amount of cold water, and recrystallized from absolute<br>
methanol. The crystalline salt of Formula 607a is isolated and optionally purified.<br>

combined, made strongly alkaline, and washed three times with diethyl ether. The combined<br>
organic layers are washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate. Hydrochloric acid is<br>
passed through the solution until the precipitation of hydrochloride salt is complete. The same<br>
procedure as above can be applied with D-N-acetylleucine salt. The crystalline compound of<br>
Formula 607b is isolated and optionally purified.<br><br>

added an excess of a primary amine in an inert solvent such as THF. The reaction mixture is<br>
heated to about about 100 °K*I under microwave irradiation for about 4 h. The product, a<br>
compound of Formula 711, is isolated and purified.<br><br>
[00148]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 7. Step 1, to a suspension of zinc powder in a<br>
dry degassed polar, aprotic solvent .such as DMF was activated using techniques known in the<br>
art and further described in the example as follows. 1,2-Dibromoethane was added to the zinc<br>
solution under nitrogen. The mixture was heated using a heat gun for about 30 seconds until<br>
gas starts to evolve from the solution, indicating the activation of the zinc. The mixture was<br>
then allowed to cool to room temperature followed by the addition of TMSC1, and allowed to<br>
stir at room temperature for 30 min. A solution of a compound of Formula 701 in a dry<br>
degassed polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF was added to the zinc solution, and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The solution of 702 is used for the next<br><br>
step.<br>
[00149]	Referring to Reaction Scheme 7, Step2, to a solution of 702 was a added a<br>
solution of a compound of Formula 703 (where X1 is Br or I) in a dry degassed polar, aprotic<br>
solvent such as DMF, and a palladium catalyst and a ligand such as Pd2(dba3), and tri-o-<br>
tolylphospine. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hour. The product, a compound of<br>
Formula 704 is isolated and purified.<br>
[00150]	Once made, the chemical entities of the invention find use in a variety of<br>
applications involving alteration of mitosis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art,<br>
mitosis may be altered in a variety of ways; that is, one can affect mitosis either by increasing<br>
or decreasing the activity of a component in the mitotic pathway. Stated differently, mitosis<br>
may be affected (e.K*i., disrupted) by disturbing equilibrium, either by inhibiting or activating<br>
certain components. Similar approaches may be used to alter meiosis.<br>
[00151]	In some embodiments, the chemical entities of the invention are used to inhibit<br>
mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis. By "inhibit" in<br>
this context is meant decreasing or interfering with mitotic spindle formation or causing<br>
mitotic spindle dysfunction. By "mitotic spindle formation" herein is meant organization of<br>
microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. By "mitotic spindle dysfunction"<br>
herein is meant mitotic arrest.<br>
[00152]	The chemical entities of the invention bind to, and/or inhibit the activity of,<br>
one or more mitotic kinesin. In some embodiments, the mitotic kinesin is human, although<br>
the chemical entities may be used to bind to or inhibit the activity of mitotic kinesins from<br>
other organisms. In this context, "inhibit" means either increasing or decreasing spindle pole<br>
separation, causing malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle poles, or otherwise causing<br>
morphological perturbation of the mitotic spindle. Also included within the definition of a<br>
mitotic kinein for these purposes are variants and/or fragments of such protein and more<br>
particularly, the motor domain of such protein.<br>
[00153]	The chemical entities of the invention are used to treat cellular proliferation<br>
diseases. Such disease states which can be treated by the chemical entities provided herein<br>
include, but are not limited to, cancer (further discussed below), autoimmune disease, fungal<br>
disorders, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, cellular proliferation induced<br>
after medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the like.<br>
Treatment includes inhibiting cellular proliferation. It is appreciated that in some cases the<br>
cells may not be in an abnormal state and still require treatment. Thus, in some<br><br>
embodiments, the invention herein includes application to cells or individuals afflicted or<br>
subject to impending affliction with any one of these disorders or states.<br>

As used herein, treatment of cancer includes treatment of cancerous cells, including cells afflicted .<br>
by any one of the above-identified conditions. Thus, the term "cancerous cell" as provided<br>
herein, includes a cell afflicted by any one of the above identified conditions.<br>
[00155]	Another useful aspect of the invention is a kit having at least one chemical<br>
entity described herein and a package insert or other labeling including directions treating a<br>
cellular proliferative disease by administering an effective amount of the at least one chemical<br>
entity. The chemical entity in the kits of the invention is particularly provided as one or more<br>
doses for a course of treatment for a cellular proliferative disease, each dose being a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation including a pharmaceutical excipient and at least one chemical<br>
entity described herein.<br>
[00156]	For assay of mitotic kinesin-modulating activity, generally either a mitotic<br>
kinesin or at least one chemical entity described herein is non-diffusably bound to an<br>
insoluble support having isolated sample receiving areas (e.K*i., a microtiter plate, an array,<br>
etc.). The insoluble support may be made of any composition to which the sample can be<br>
bound, is readily separated from soluble material, and is otherwise compatible with the<br>
overall method of screening. The surface of such supports may be solid or porous and of any<br>
convenient shape. Examples of suitable insoluble supports include microtiter plates, arrays,<br><br>
membranes and beads. These are typically made of glass, plastic (e.K*i., polystyrene),<br>
polysaccharides, nylon or nitrocellulose, Teflon™, etc. Microtiter plates and arrays are<br>
especially convenient because a large number of assays can be carried out simultaneously,<br>
using small amounts of reagents and samples. The particular manner of binding of the<br>
sample is not crucial so long as it is compatible with the reagents and overall methods of the<br>
invention, maintains the activity of the sample and is nondiffusable. Particular methods of<br>
binding include the use of antibodies (which do not sterically block either the ligand binding<br>
site or activation sequence when the protein is bound to the support), direct binding to<br>
"sticky" or ionic supports, chemical crosslinking, the synthesis of the protein or agent on the<br>
surface, etc. Following binding of the sample, excess unbound material is removed by<br>
washing. The sample receiving areas may then be blocked through incubation with bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA), casein or other innocuous protein or other moiety.<br>
[00157]	The chemical entities of the invention may be used on their own to inhibit the<br>
activity of a mitotic kinesin. In some embodiments, at least one chemical entity of the<br>
invention is combined with a mitotic kinesin and the activity of the mitotic kinesin is<br>
assayed. Kinesin activity is known in the art and includes one or more of the following: the<br>
ability to affect ATP hydrolysis; microtubule binding; gliding and<br>
polymerization/depolymerization (effects on microtubule dynamics); binding to other proteins<br>
of the spindle; binding to proteins involved in cel1-cycle control; serving as a substrate to<br>
other enzymes, such 3S kinases or proteases; and specific kinesin cellular activities such as<br>
spindle pole separation.<br>
[00158]	Methods of performing motility assays are well knoAvn to those of skill in the<br>
art. (See e.K*i., Hall, et al. (1996), Biophys. J., 71: 3467-3476, Turner et al., 1996, AnaL<br>
Biochem. 242 (l):20-5; Gittes et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 7O(1): 418-29; Shirakawa et al., 1995,<br>
J. Exp. BioL 198: 1809-15; Winkelmann et al., 1995, Biophys. J. 68: 2444-53; Winkelmann<br>
et al., 1995, Biophys. J. 68: 72S.)<br>
[00159]	Methods known in the art for determining ATPase hydrolysis activity also can<br>
be used. Suitably, solution based assays are utilized. U.S. Patent 6,410,254, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes such assays. Alternatively, conventional<br>
methods are used. For example, Pi release from kinesin (and more particularly, the motor<br>
domain of a mitotic kinesin) can be quantified. In some embodiments, the ATPase hydrolysis<br>
activity assay utilizes 0.3 M PCA (perchloric acid) and malachite green reagent (8.27 mM<br>
sodium molybdate II. 0.33 mM malachite green oxalate, and 0.8 mM Triton X-100). To<br><br>
perform the assay, 10 µL of the reaction mixture is quenched in 90 µL of cold 0.3 M PCA.<br>
Phosphate standards are used so data can be converted to mM inorganic phosphate released.<br>
When all reactions and standards have been quenched in PCA, 100 µL of malachite green<br>
reagent is added to the relevant wells in e.K*i., a microtiter plate. The mixture is developed for<br>
10-15 minutes and the plate is read at an absorbance of 650 nm. If phosphate standards were<br>
used, absorbance readings can be converted to mM Pi and plotted over time. Additionally,<br>
ATPase assays known in the art include the luciferase assay.<br>
[00160]	ATPase activity of kinesin motor domains also can be used to monitor the<br>
effects of agents and are well known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments<br>
ATPase assays of kinesin are performed in the absence of microtubules. In some<br>
embodiments, the ATPase assays are performed in the presence of microtubules. Different<br>
types of agents can be detected in the above assays. In some embodiments, the effect of an<br>
agent is independent of the concentration of microtubules and ATP. In some embodiments,<br>
the effect of the agents on kinesin ATPase can be decreased by increasing the concentrations<br>
of ATP, microtubules or both. In some embodiments, the effect of the agent is increased by<br>
increasing concentrations of ATP, microtubules or both.<br>
[00161]	Chemical entities that inhibit the biochemical activity of a mitotic kinesin in<br>
vitro may then be screened in vivo. In vivo screening methods include assays of cell cycle<br>
distribution, cell viability, or the presence, morphology, activity, distribution, or number of<br>
mitotic spindles. Methods for monitoring cell cycle distribution of a cell population, for<br>
example, by flow cytometry, are well known to those skilled in the art, as are methods for<br>
determining cell viability. See for example, U.S. Patent 6,437,115, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. Microscopic methods for monitoring spindle formation and<br>
malformation are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.K*i., Whitehead and Rattner<br>
(1998), J. Cell Sci. 111:2551-61; Galgio et al, (1996) J. Cell Biol., 135:399-414), each<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00162]	The chemical entities of the invention inhibit one or more mitotic kinesins.<br>
One measure of inhibition is IC50, defined as the concentration of the chemical entity at which<br>
the activity of the mitotic kinesin is decreased by fifty percent relative to a control. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 1 mM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 100 µM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 10 µM. In some<br><br>
- embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 1 µM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 100 nM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has an IC50 of less than about 10 nM.<br>
Measurement of IC50 is done using an ATPase assay such as described herein.<br>
[00163]	Another measure of inhibition is Kj. For chemical entities with IC50'S less than<br>
1 µM, the K*i or Kd is defined as the dissociation rate constant for the interaction of the<br>
compounds described herein, with a mitotic kinesin. In some embodiments, the at least one<br>
chemical entity has a K*i of less than about 100 µM. In some embodiments, the at least one<br>
chemical entity has a K*i of less than about 10 µM. In some embodiments, the at least one<br>
chemical entity has a K*i of less than about 1 µM. In some embodiments, the at least one<br>
chemical entity has a K*i of less than about 100 nM. In some embodiments, the at least one<br>
chemical entity has a K*i of less than about 10 nM.<br>
[00164]	The K*i for a chemical entity is determined from the IC50 based on three<br>
assumptions and the Michaelis-Menten equation. First, only one compound molecule binds<br>
to the enzyme and there is no cooperativity. Second, the concentrations of active enzyme and<br>
the compound tested are known (i.e., there are no significant amounts of impurities or<br>
inactive forms in the preparations). Third, the enzymatic rate of the enzyme-inhibitor<br>
complex is zero. The rate (i.e., compound concentration) data are fitted to the equation:<br><br>
where V is the observed rate, Vmax is the rate of the free enzyme, I0 is the inhibitor<br>
concentration, Eo is the enzyme concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the<br>
enzyme-inhibitor complex.<br>
[00165]	Another measure of inhibition is GI50, defined as the concentration of the<br>
chemical entity that results in a decrease in the rate of cell growth by fifty percent. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 1 mM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 20 µM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 10 µM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 1 µM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 100 nM. In some<br>
embodiments, the at least one chemical entity has a GI50 of less than about 10 nM.<br><br>
Measurement of GISO is done using a cell proliferation assay such as described herein.<br>
Chemical entities of this class were found to inhibit cell proliferation.<br>
(O0166]	In vitro potency of small molecule inhibitors is determined, for example, by<br>
assaying human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) for viability following a 72-hour exposure to a<br>
9-point dilution series of compound. Cell viability is determined by measuring the<br>
absorbance of formazon, a product formed by the bioreduction of MTS/PMS, a commercially<br>
available reagent. Each point on the dose-response curve is calculated as a percent of<br>
untreated control cells at 72 hours minus background absorption (complete cell kill).<br>
[00167]	Anti-proliferative compounds that have been successfully applied in the clinic<br>
to treatment of cancer (cancer chemotherapeutics) have GIso's that van' greatly. For example,<br>
in A549 cells, paclitaxel GI50 is 4 nM, doxorubicin is 63 nM, 5-fluorouracil is 1 µM, and<br>
hydroxyurea is 500 uM (data provided by National Cancer Institute, Developmental<br>
Therapeutic Program, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). Therefore, compounds that inhibit cellular<br>
proliferation, irrespective of the concentration demonstrating inhibition, have potential<br>
clinical usefulness.<br>
[00168]	To employ the chemical entities of the invention in a method of screening for<br>
compounds that bind to a mitotic kinesin, the mitotic kinesin is bound to a support, and a<br>
compound of the invention is added to the assay. Alternatively, the chemical entity of the<br>
invention is bound to the support and a mitotic kinesin is added. Classes of compounds<br>
among which novel binding agents may be sought include specific antibodies, non-natural<br>
binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc. Of particular<br>
interest are screening assays for candidate agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A<br>
wide variety of assays may be used for this purpose, including labeled in vitro protein-protein<br>
binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding,<br>
functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.<br>
[00169]	The determination of the binding of the chemical entities of the invention to a<br>
mitotic kinesin may be done in a number of ways. In some embodiments, the chemical entity<br>
is labeled, for example, with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety, and binding is determined<br>
directly. For example, this may be done by attaching all or a portion of a mitotic kinesin to a<br>
solid support, adding a labeled test compound (for example a chemical entity of the invention<br>
in which at least one atom has been replaced by a detectable isotope), washing off excess<br>
reagent, and determining whether the amount of the label is that present on the solid support.<br>
[00170]	By "labeled" herein is meant that the compound is either directly or indirectly<br><br>
labeled with a label which provides a detectable signal, e.K*i., radioisotope, fluorescent tag,<br>
enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescent tag, or specific<br>
binding molecules, etc. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and<br>
streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin etc. For the specific binding members, the<br>
complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule which provides for<br>
detection, in accordance with known procedures, as outlined above. The label can directly or<br>
indirectly provide a detectable signal.	<br>
(O0171]	In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. For example,<br>
the kinesin proteins may be labeled at tyrosine positions using 125I, or with fluorophores.<br>
Alternatively, more than one component may be labeled with different labels; using l25I for<br>
the proteins, for example, and a fluorophor for the antimitotic agents.<br>
[00172]	The chemical entities of the invention may also be used as competitors to<br>
screen for additional drug candidates. "Candidate agent" or "drug candidate" or grammatical<br>
equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, e.K*i., protein, oligopeptide, small organic<br>
molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for bioactivity. They may be<br>
capable of directly or indirectly altering the cellular proliferation phenotype or the expression<br>
of a cellular proliferation sequence, including both nucleic acid sequences and protein<br>
sequences. In other cases, alteration of cellular proliferation protein binding and/or activity is<br>
screened. Screens of this sort may be performed either in the presence or absence of<br>
microtubules. In the case where protein binding or activity is screened, particular<br>
embodiments exclude molecules already known to bind to that particular protein, for<br>
example, polymer structures such as microtubules, and energy sources such as ATP.<br>
Particular embodiments of assays herein include candidate agents which do not bind the<br>
cellular proliferation protein in its endogenous native state termed herein as "exogenous"<br>
agents. In some embodiments, exogenous agents further exclude antibodies to the mitotic<br>
kinesin.<br>
[00173]	Candidate agents can encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically<br>
they are small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than<br>
about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural<br>
interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding and lipophilic binding, and typically<br>
include at least an amine, carbonyl-, hydroxyl-, ether, or carboxyl group, generally at least<br>
two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon<br>
or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or<br><br>
more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules<br>
including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives,<br>
structural analogs or combinations thereof.<br>
[00174]	Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including<br>
libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for<br>
random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules,<br>
including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural<br>
compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily<br>
produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily<br>
modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means. Known<br>
pharmacological agents.may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such<br>
as acylation, alkylation, esterification, and/or amidification to produce structural analogs.<br>
[00175]	Competitive screening assays may be done by combining a mitotic kinesin and<br>
a drug candidate in a first sample. A second sample comprises at least one chemical entity of<br>
the present invention, a mitotic kinesin and a drug candidate. This may be performed in<br>
either the presence or absence of microtubules. The binding of the drug candidate is<br>
determined for both samples, and a change, or difference in binding between the two samples<br>
indicates the presence of a drug candidate capable of binding to a mitotic kinesin and<br>
potentially inhibiting its activity. That is, if the binding of the drug candidate is different in<br>
the second sample relative to the first sample, the drug candidate is capable of binding to a<br>
mitotic kinesin.<br>
[00176]	In some embodiments, the binding of the candidate agent to a mitotic kinesin<br>
is determined through the use of competitive binding assays. In some embodiments, the<br>
competitor is a binding moiety known to bind to the mitotic kinesin, such as an antibody,<br>
peptide, binding partner, ligand, etc. Under certain circumstances, there may be competitive<br>
binding as between the candidate agent and the binding moiety, with the binding moiety<br>
displacing the candidate agent.<br>
[00177]	In some embodiments, the candidate agent is labeled. Either the candidate<br>
agent, or the competitor, or both, is added first to the mitotic kinesin for a time sufficient to<br>
allow binding, if present. Incubations may be performed at any temperature which facilitates<br>
optimal activity, typically between 4 and 40°K*I.<br>
[00178]	Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but may also be<br>
optimized to facilitate rapid high tliroughput screening. Typically between 0.1 and 1 hour<br><br>
will be sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second<br>
component is then added., and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed,<br>
to indicate binding.<br>
[00179]	In some embodiments, the competitor is added first, followed by the candidate<br>
agent. Displacement of the competitor is an indication the candidate agent is binding to the<br>
mitotic kinesin and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially inhibiting, the activity of the<br>
mitotic kinesin. In some embodiments, either component can be labeled.Thus, for example,<br>
if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the wash solution indicates displacement<br>
by the agent. Alternatively, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the<br>
support indicates displacement.<br>
[001801	In some embodiments, the candidate agent is added first, with incubation and<br>
washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor may indicate<br>
the candidate agent is bound to the mitotic kinesin with a higher affinity. Thus, if the<br>
candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of<br>
competitor binding, may indicate the candidate agent is capable of binding to the mitotic<br>
kinesin.<br>
[00181]	Inhibition is tested by screening for candidate agents capable of inhibiting the<br>
activity of a mitotic kinesin comprising the steps of combining a candidate agent with a<br>
mitotic kinesin as above, and determining an alteration in the biological activity of the mitotic<br>
kinesin. Thus, in some embodiments, the candidate agent should both bind to the mitotic<br>
kinesin (although this may not be necessary), and alter its biological or biochemical activity<br>
as defined herein. The methods include both in vitro screening methods and in vivo<br>
screening of cells for alterations in cell cycle distribution, cell viability, or for the presence,<br>
morpohology, activity, distribution, or amount of mitotic spindles, as are generally outlined<br>
above.<br>
[00182]	Alternatively, differential screening may be used to identify drug candidates<br>
that bind to the native mitotic kinesin but cannot bind to a modified mitotic kinesin.<br>
[00183]	Positive controls and negative controls may be used in the assays. Suitably all<br>
control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically significant<br>
results. Incubation of all samples is for a time sufficient for the binding of the agent to the<br>
protein. Following incubation, all samples are washed free of non-specifically bound material<br>
and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determined. For example, where a<br>
radiolabel is employed, the samples may be counted in a scintillation counter to determine the<br><br>
amount of bound compound.<br>
[00184]	A variety of other reagents may be included in the screening assays. These<br>
include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.K*i., albumin, detergents, etc which may be used<br>
to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background<br>
interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as<br>
protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may be used. The mixture<br>
of components may be added in any order that provides for the requisite binding.<br>
[00185]	Accordingly, the chemical entities of the invention are administered to cells.<br>
By "administered" herein is meant administration of a therapeutically effective dose of at least<br>
one chemical entity of the invention to a cell either in cell culture or in a patient. By<br>
"therapeutically effective dose" herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is<br>
administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be<br>
ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. As is known in the art,<br>
adjustments for systemic versus localized delivery, age, body weight, general health, sex, diet,<br>
time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary,<br>
and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. By "cells"<br>
herein is meant any cell in which mitosis or meiosis can be altered.<br>
[00186]	A "patient" for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and<br>
other animals, particularly mammals, and other organisms. Thus the methods are applicable<br>
to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a<br>
mammal, and more particularly, the patient is human.<br>
[00187]	Chemical entities of the invention having the desired pharmacological activity<br>
may be administered, in some embodiments, as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition<br>
comprising an pharmaceutical excipient, to a patient, as described herein. Depending upon<br>
the manner of introduction, the chemical entities may be formulated in a variety of ways as<br>
discussed below. The concentration of the at least one chemical entity in the formulation may<br>
vary from about 0.1-100 wt.%.<br>
[00188]	The agents may be administered alone or in combination with other<br>
treatments, i.e., radiation, or other chemotherapeutic agents such as the taxane class of agents<br>
that appear to act on microtubule formation or the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I<br>
inhibitors. When used, other chemotherapeutic agents may be administered before,<br>
concurrently, or after administration of at least one chemical entity of the present invention.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, at least one chemical entity of the present invention is K*i-<br><br>
administered with one or more other chemotherapeutic agents. By "K*i-administer" it is meant<br>
that the at least one chemical entity is administered to a patient such that the at least one<br>
chemical entity as well as the K*i-administered compound may be found in the patient's<br>
bloodstream at the same time, regardless when the compounds are actually administered,<br>
including simultaneously.<br>
[00189]	The administration of the chemical entities of the present invention can be<br>
done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneSusly, intravenously,<br>
intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneal!}', intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginally,<br>
rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example, in the treatment of wounds and<br>
inflammation, the compound or composition may be directly applied as a solution or spray.<br>
[00190]	Pharmaceutical dosage forms include at least one chemical entity described<br>
herein and one or more pharmaceutical excipients. As is known in the art, pharmaceutical<br>
excipients are secondary ingredients which function to enable or enhance the delivery of a<br>
drug or medicine in a variety of dosage forms (e.K*i.: oral fonns such as tablets, capsules, and<br>
liquids; topical forms such as dermal, opthalmic, and otic forms; suppositories; injectables;<br>
respiratory forms and the like). Pharmaceutical excipients include inert or inactive<br>
ingredients, synergists or chemicals that substantively contribute to the medicinal effects of<br>
the active ingredient. For example, pharmaceutical excipients may function to improve flow<br>
characteristics, product uniformity, stability, taste, or appearance, to ease handling and<br>
administration of dose, for convenience of use, or to control bioavailability. While<br>
pharmaceutical excipients are commonly described as being inert or inactive, it is appreciated<br>
in the art that there is a relationship between the properties of the pharmaceutical excipients<br>
and the dosage forms containing them.<br>
[00191]	Pharmaceutical excipients suitable for use as earners or diluents are well<br>
known in the art, and may be used in a variety of formulations. See, e.K*i., Remington's<br>

[00192]	Oral solid dosage forms such as tablets will typically comprise one or more<br>
pharmaceutical excipients, which may for example help impart satisfactory processing and<br><br>
compression characteristics, or provide additional desirable physical characteristics to the<br>
tablet. Such pharmaceutical excipients may be selected from diluents, binders, glidants,<br>
lubricants, disintegrants, colors, flavors, sweetening agents, polymers, waxes or other<br>
solubility-retarding materials.<br>
[00193]	Compositions for intravenous administration will generally comprise<br>
intravenous fluids, i.e., sterile solutions of simple chemicals such as sugars, amino acids or<br>
electrolytes, which can be easily carried by the circulatory system and assimilated. Such<br>
fluids are prepared with water for injection USP.<br>

Inhibition of Cellular Viability in Tumor Cell Lines Treated with Mitotic Kinesin<br>
Inhibitors<br>
(O0551]	Materials and Solutions:<br>
•	Cells: SKOV3, Ovarian Cancer (human).<br>
•	Media: Phenol Red Free RPMI + 5% Fetal Bovine Serum + 2mM L-glutamine.<br>
•	Colorimetric Agent for Determining Cell Viability: Promega MTS tetrazolium<br>
compound.<br><br>
• Control Compound for max cell kill: Topotecan, 1 µM.<br>
Procedure: Day 1- Cell Plating:<br>
[00552]	Adherent SKOV3 cells are washed with 10mLs of PBS followed by the<br>
addition of 2mLs of 0.25% trypsin and incubation for 5 minutes at 37°K*I. The cells are rinsed<br>
from the flask using 8 mL of media (phenol red-free RPMI+ 5%FBS) and transferred to fresh<br>
flask. Cell concentration is determined using a Coulter counter and the appropriate volume of<br>
cells to achieve 1000 cells/100µL is calculated. 100 µL of media cell suspension (adjusted to<br>
1000 cells/100 µL) is added to all wells of 96-well plates, followed by incubation for 18 to 24<br>
hours at 37°K*I, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2, allowing the cells to adhere to the plates.<br>
Procedure: Day 2 - Compound Addition:<br>
(O0553]	To one column of the wells of an autoclaved assay block are added an initial<br>
2.5 µL of test compound(s) at 400X the highest desired concentration. 1.25 µL of 400X<br>
(400|uM) Topotecan is added to other wells (ODs from these wells are used to subtract out for<br>
background absorbance of dead cells and vehicle). 500 µL of media without DMSO are<br>
added to the wells containing test compound, and 250 µL to the Topotecan wells. 250 µL of<br>
media + 0.5% DMSO is added to all remaining wells, into which the test compound(s) are<br>
serially diluted. By row, compound-containing media is replica plated (in duplicate) from the<br>
assay block to the corresponding cell plates. The cell plates are incubated for 72hours at<br>
37°K*I, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2.<br>
Procedure: Day 4 - MTS Addition and OD Reading:<br>
[00554]	The plates are removed from the incubator and 40 µl MTS / PMS is added to<br>
each well. Plates are then incubated for 120 minutes at 37°K*I, 100% humidity, 5%CO2,<br>
followed by reading the ODs at 490nm after a 5 second shaking cycle in a ninety-six well<br>
spectrophotometer.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
[00555]	The normalized % of control (absorbance- background) is calculated and an<br>
XLfit is used to generate a dose-response curve from which the concentration of compound<br>
required to inhibit viability by 50% is determined. The compounds of the present invention<br><br>
show activity when tested by this method.<br>
Example 100<br>
Application of a Mitotic Kinesin Inhibitor<br>
[00556]	Human tumor cells Skov-3 (ovarian) were plated in 96-well plates at densities<br>
of 4,000 cells per well, allowed to adhere for 24 hours, and treated with various<br>
concentrations of the test compounds for 24 hours. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and<br>
stained with antitubulin antibodies (subsequently recognized using fluorescently-labeled<br>
secondary antibody) and Hoechst dye (which stains DNA).<br>
(O0557)	Visual inspection revealed that the compounds caused cell cycle arrest.<br>
Example 101<br>
Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation in Tumor Cell Lines Treated with Mitotic Kinesin<br>
Inhibitors.<br>
[00558]	Cells were plated in 96-well plates at densities from 1000-2500 cells/well of a<br>
96-well plate and allowed to adhere/grow for 24 hours. They were then treated with various<br>
concentrations of ding for 4S hours. The time at which compounds are added is considered<br>
To. A tetrazolium-based assay using the reagent 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo1-2-yl)-5-(3-<br>
carbox\'methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (I.S&gt; Patent No.<br>
5,185,450) (see Promega product catalog #G358O, CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell<br>
Proliferation Assay) was used to determine the number of viable cells at To and the number of<br>
cells remaining after 48 hours compound exposure. The number of cells remaining after 48<br>
hours was compared to the number of viable cells at the time of drug addition, allowing for<br>
calculation of growth inhibition.<br>
[00559]	The growth over 48 hours of cells in control wells that had been treated with<br>
vehicle only (0.25% DMSO) is considered 100% growth and the growth of cells in wells with<br>
compounds is compared to this. Mitotic kinesin inhibitors inhibited cell proliferation in<br>
human ovarian tumor cell lines (SKOV-3).<br>
[00560]	A Gi50 was calculated by plotting the concentration of compound in uM vs the<br>
percentage of cell growth of cell growth in treated wells. The Gi50 calculated for the<br>
compounds is the estimated concentration at which growth is inhibited by 50% compared to<br>
control, i.e., the concentration at which:<br><br><br>
[00561]	All concentrations of compounds are tested in duplicate and controls are<br>
averaged over 12 wells. A very similar 96-well plate layout and Gi50 calculation scheme is<br>
used by the National Cancer Institute (see Monks, et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:757-766<br>
(1991)). However, the method by which the National Cancer Institute quantitates cell number<br>
does not use MTS, but instead employs alternative methods.<br>
Example 102<br>
Calculation of IC50:<br>
Measurement of a composition's IC50 uses an ATPase assay. The following solutions are<br>
used: Solution 1 consists of 3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate potassium salt (Sigma P-7127), 2<br>
mM ATP (Sigma A-3377), 1 mM IDTT (Sigma D-9779), 5 µM paclitaxel (Sigma T-7402),<br>
10 ppm antifoam 289 (Sigma A-8436), 25 mM Pipes/K*I pH 6.8 (Sigma P6757), 2 mM<br>
MgC12 (WVR JT400301), and 1 mM EGTA (Sigma E3889). Solution 2 consists of 1 mM<br>
NADH (Sigma NS129), 0.2 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A7906), pyruvate kinase 7U/ml, L-lactate<br>
dehydrogenase 10 U/ml (Sigma P0294), 100 nM motor domain of a mitotic kinesin. 50 ng/ml<br>
microtubules; 1 mM DTT (Sigma D9779), 5 uM paclitaxel (Sigma T-7402), 10 ppm antifoam<br>
289 (Sigma A-8436), 25 mM Pipes/K*I pH 6.S (Sigma P6757), 2 mM MgC12 (VWR<br>
JT4003-01), and 1 mM EGTA (Sigma E3889). Serial dilutions (8-12 two-fold dilutions) of<br>
the composition are made in a 96-well microliter plate (Corning Costar 3695) using Solution<br>
1. Following serial dilution each well has 50 µl of Solution 1. The reaction is started by<br>
adding 50 pi of solution 2 to each well. This may be done with a multichannel pipettor either<br>
manually or with automated liquid handling devices. The microliter plate is then transferred<br>
to a microplate absorbance reader and multiple absorbance readings at 340 nm are taken for<br>
each well in a kinetic mode. The observed rate of change, which is proportional to the<br>
ATPase rate, is then plotted as a function of the compound concentration. For a standard IC50<br>
determination the data acquired is fit by the following four parameter equation using a<br>
nonlinear fitting program (e.K*i., Grafit 4):<br><br>
where y is the observed rate and x the compound concentration.<br>
[00562]	Other chemical entities of this class were found to inhibit cell proliferation,<br><br>
although GI50 values varied. GI50 values for the chemical entities tested ranged from 200 nM<br>
to greater than the highest concentration tested. By this we mean that although most of the<br>
chemical entities that inhibited mitotic kinesin activity biochemically did inhibit cell<br>
proliferation, for some, at the highest concentration tested (generally about 20 µM), cell<br>
growth was inhibited less than 50%. Many of the chemical entities have GI50 values less than<br>
10 µM, and several have GI50 values less than 1 µM. Anti-proliferative compounds that have<br>
been successfully applied in the clinic to treatment of cancer (cancer chemotherapeutics) have<br>
GI50's that vary greatly. For example, in A549 cells, paclitaxel GI50 is 4 nM, doxorubicin is<br>
63 nM, 5-fiuorouracil is 1 µM, and hydroxyurea is 500 µM (data provided by National Cancer<br>
Institute, Developmental Therapeutic Program, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). Therefore,<br>
compounds that inhibit cellular proliferation at virtually any concentration may be useful.<br><br>
