The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the manufacture of polyene esters and acids from acetalized polyene aldehydes by an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction with vinylketene acetals.<br>
Lewis acid-catalyzed additions of cc,p-unsaturated  ethers (enol ethers) to acetals have been known for a long time and date back to the work of Muller-Cunradi and Pieroh (see US Patent 2,165,962). Hoaglin and Hirsch [J.A.C.S. Zl, 3468 (1949)] investigated this reaction further and broadened the possible applications, which Isler et al. likewise did in the nineteen fifties with respect to the synthesis of (3-carotene,  crocetin dialdehyde, lycopene as well as (3-apocarotenoids [see Helv. Chim. Acta 3j£, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956), ibid. 42, 854 et seq. (1959) as well as US Patents 2,827,481 and 2,827,482].   Later, Mukaiyama [Angew. Chem. S9, 858 et seq. (1977) and Org. Reactions 2JL, 203 et seq. (1982)] extended the reaction by using the readily accessible trimethylsilyl enol ethers.<br>
The first Lewis acid-catalyzed condensations of 1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes (dienol ethers) with a,p-unsaturated acetals were<br>
reported by Nazarov and Krasnaya [J. Gen. Chem. USSR 2£, 2477 et seq. (1958)] and by Makin [Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 47, 173 et seq. (1976), J. Gen. Chem. USSR 21, 3096 et seq. (1961) and 22, 3112 et seq. (1962)].   Here, the coupling of the acetai to the dienol ether takes place as far as can be seen exclusively at its y-position with the formation of a chain-lengthened a,p-<br>
unsaturated acetai, which, however, in competition with the first acetai reacts with further dienol ether with the formation of a further, chain-lengthened a,(3-unsaturated acetai etc. [telomer formation; see also Chemla et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1 30. 200 et seq. (1993)].  For this reason such a condensation has been found not to be workable for synthetic purposes, especially for the synthesis of apocarotenoids [Isler et al., Adv. Org. Chem. 4, 115 et seq. (1963)].<br><br>
Not only 1-alkoxy-1,3-dienes, but also trimethylsilyloxy-dienes [of the type CH2=CH-CH=CH-OSi(CH3)3] can be condensed with acetals in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts, as disclosed by Mukaiyama et al. in Chem. Lett. 1975, 319 et seq.   In this coupling too the attack takes place exclusively at the terminal (y-) carbon atom of the diene system in order to form "y-Products"<br>
[see Mukaiyama et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jap £0, 1161 et seq. (1977) and Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) 36,645/1977].   In contrast to the reaction with 1-alkoxy-l,3-dienes, in the case of the reaction of trimethylsilyloxydienes with acetals there is formed an aldehyde which does not react further with the diene (no telomer formation).   By using this method Mukaiyama et al. were able to synthesize vitamin A [see Kokai 36.645/1977, Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq. and Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan £1, 2077 et seq. (1978)] and workers from Rhone-Poulenc developed new routes to carotenoids and vitamin A (see DOS 2,701,489 and A.E.C. Societe de Chimie Organique et Biologique No. 7824350).<br>
Silylated vinylketene acetals [of the type CH2=CH-CH=C-(Oalkyl)(OSi(CH3)3)] can also react with acetals analogously to the aforementioned trimethylsilyloxydienes [see Tetr. Lett. 2(), 3209 et seq. (1979) and Chimia 34, 265 et seq. (1980)].  As will be evident from, inter alia, Tetr. Lett. £2., 2833 et seq. (1981), ibid. 2£, 397 et seq. (1985), DOS 3,244,273 and US Patent 4,937,308, there are, however, hitherto always formed in this reaction (not readily separable) mixtures of the two possible y-and a-coupling products ["y-Products" „..CH(0alkyP)-CH2-CH=CH-C00alky|2; "a-products" ....CH(Oalkyn)-C(CH3)(CH=CH2)-COOalkyl2].   Therefore, this reaction also appears to be hardly usable for synthetic purposes in the carotenoid field.   This reaction would be interesting and useful only if complete y-selectivity could be achieved, for example for the synthesis of<br>
polyenes, namely apoesters, crocetin esters etc.; because by elimination of the alcohol alkyMOH from the y-product it is<br>
possible to form, if desired, a further (conjugated) double bond with the formation of the product ...CH=CH-CH=CH-COOalkyl2.<br><br>
Thus, such polyenes could be produced without employing the Wittig or Horner reaction hitherto used for this purpose.<br>
The object of the present invention is to manufacture, starting from polyene (di)acetals and vinylketene acetals or silylated analogues thereof, correspondingly chain-lengthened polyene (di)esters or acids while avoiding as far as possible the aforementioned disadvantages of the state of the art and replacing the Wittig or Horner reaction hitherto used for this purpose.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by reacting a polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal with a vinyl-0,0-dialkyl- or 0,0-alkylene-ketene acetal or an 0-mono- or 0,0-disilylated analogue thereof in the presence of a Lewis acid to give the correspondingly chain-lengthened (bis)5-alkoxy-y,8-<br>
saturated polyene ester or the corresponding (di)acid and subsequently eliminating the 8-positioned alkanol from the thus-formed (di)ester or from the corresponding (di)acid under basic conditions in order to obtain the desired (conjugated) polyene (di)ester or the corresponding (di)acid.   Not only is the reaction of the vinyl-0,0-dialkyl- or vinyl-0,0-alkylene-ketene acetal or of the 0-mono- or 0,0-disilylated analogue with the polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal novel, but surprisingly it takes place (so far as can be seen) with exclusive attack at the y-position of the vinylketene acetal derivative.   By the subsequent base-induced elimination of the alkanol a (conjugated) C-C double bond is formed without requiring a phosphorus-containing or silicon-containing reagent, which is in contrast to the methodology i     hitherto usually used in this field.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of a polyene ester or a polyene acid of the general formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A       signifies a monovalent, optionally methyl-substituted,<br>
conjugated polyene group, B        signifies a  bivalent,  optionally methyl-substituted,<br>
conjugated polyene group, R1 and R2 each signify hydrogen or methyl and R3      signifies hydrogen or Ci-6-alkyl,<br>
with the -CH=CH-C(R1)=C(R2)-COOR3 group(s) in each case<br>
being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated<br>
chain of group A or B, which process comprises reacting a polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
A and B       have the significances given above, with in this case<br>
the -CH(0R4)2 group(s) being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated chain of group A or B and<br>
R4	signifies   Ci-6-alkyl,<br>
with a vinylketene acetal or analogue thereof of the general<br>
formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2    have the significances given above and<br>
R5	signifies  Ci -6-alkyl  and<br>
R6	signifies   Ci-6-alkyl  or tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl<br>
or R5 and R6 both signify tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl<br>
or R5 and R6 together form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene,<br>
in the presence of a Lewis acid, hydrolyzing the reaction mixture<br>
where a vinylketene acetal of formula III in which R5 and R6 both<br>
signify Ci -6-alkyl or both signify tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl  or together<br>
form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene is used, subsequently (in<br>
all cases) cleaving off the alcohol R40H under strong basic<br>
conditions from the thus-produced compound of the general<br>
formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
A, B, R1, R2 and R4   have the significances given above, with in<br>
this case the -CH(OR4)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2)COOR7 group(s)<br>
being situated in the terminal position(s) of the conjugated<br>
chain of group A or B, and R7      signifies Ci-6-alkyl, hydrogen, 2-hydroxyethyl or 3-<br>
hydroxy-n-propyl, and, where there is a difference between group(s) -COOR7 and -COOR3, converting the former into the latter.<br>
The process in accordance with the invention can in principle be used in the case of all of the aforementioned polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetals of formula IT or polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals) of formula II' which have the acetal group -CH(0R4)2 at<br>
.1	i     _    ....    i.        . i.	i	r.i	i	i      . •	A	_!___!.	J	<br><br>
there are to be found, inter alia, the following sub-classes [with the abbreviated form of presentation which is usual in carotenoid chemistry (using simple lines) being used for the structural formulae]:<br>
Alicyclic-aliphatic  polyene  0,0-dialkyl  acetals,  which mainly belong to the carotenoid field [as acetals of asymmetric carotenoid aldehydes having a six-membered (cyclohexene) ring], of the general formula<br><br>
wnerein<br>
R4      has the significance given above and<br>
R8 and R9 each independently signify hydrogen, an optionally<br>
protected hydroxy group or an optionally protected oxo<br>
group, m       signifies 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and n        signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance with the invention, are converted into the corresponding alicyclic-aliphatic polyene esters or acids of the general formula<br><br>
aliphatic polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetals, which likewise mainly belong to the carotenoid field (as acetals of open-chain asymmetric carotenoid aldehydes), of the general formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R4      has the significance given above and<br>
p       signifies 0, 1 or 2,<br>
q        signifies 0, 1, 2 or 3 and<br>
n        signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance<br>
with the invention, are converted into the corresponding aliphatic<br>
polyene esters or acids of the general formula<br><br>
aliphatic polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals), which likewise mainly belong to the carotenoid field (as acetals of symmetrical carotenoid dialdehydes), of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R4     has the significance given above and<br>
r        signifies 0, 1 or 2 and<br>
n       signifies 0 or 1,<br>
which, after carrying out the multistage process in accordance<br>
with the invention, are converted into the corresponding aliphatic<br>
polyene diesters or diacids of the general formula<br><br><br><br>
wherein R' has the significance of R given above, with the dialkoxymethyl group (R40)2HC- being replaced by the group R300C-C(R2)=C(Ri)-HC=HC- where R' signifies a group (c).<br>
Formula I then embraces formulae la, lb and Ic.<br>
Where the product of formula I, especially of formula la, has one or two protected groups (R8, R9) on the cyclohexene ring, the protecting group(s) present can, if desired, be cleaved off, which represents a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
In the scope of the present invention the term "Ci-6-alkyl" embraces straight-chain and branched groups such as, for example, methyl, ethyl and isobutyl.   This applies to the Ci-6-alkyl group of a group containing this, e.g. tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl.<br>
The term "protected hydroxy group" embraces usual protected hydroxy groups (especially those which are familiar from the carotenoid field), particularly etherified hydroxy groups and acyloxy groups.   The "etherified hydroxy groups" are, for example, Ci-5-alkoxy groups, preferably methoxy and ethoxy; C2-16-alkoxyalkoxy groups,  preferably  1-methoxy-1-methylethoxy; arylalkoxy groups, preferably benzyloxy; tetrahydropyranyloxy; and tri(Ci-5-alkyl)silyloxy  groups,   preferably  trimethylsilyloxy. The acyloxy groups embrace especially alkanoyloxy and aroyloxy groups with up to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, formyloxy, acetoxy, propionyloxy and benzoyloxy.<br>
The term "protected oxo group" also embraces usual protected oxo groups (especially those which are familiar from the carotenoid field).   Acetalized oxo groups, especially those in which the term protected oxo stands for two Ci-5-alkoxy groups (e.g. two methoxy groups) or for a C2-6-alkylenedioxy group (e.g. ethylenedioxy or 2,3-butylenedioxy) are preferred.   Further, an oxo group can also be protected as an enol ether, primarily in the case of cc-hydroxyketones (e.g. R8 and R9 signify hydroxy or oxo or<br>
vice versa), whereby the etherification of the enediol can preferably also be effected by the formation of a cyclic acetal or<br><br>
ketal (e.g. with acetone to the acetonide).  The oxo group can also be protected, for example, as an imine.<br>
The formulae of polyenes disclosed in the scope of the present invention embrace in each case isomeric forms, e.g. optically active and cis/trans or E/Z isomers, as well as mixtures thereof unless indicated to the contrary.   The carbon atom carrying the residue R8 or R9 where R8 or R9 signifies an optionally protected hydroxy group (see formulae la and lla) can be mentioned as an example of a chiral (optically active) centre. With respect to E/Z isomerism, then there are generally preferred the (all-E) isomers of the educts and of the products of the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
The first process step of the process in accordance with the invention is conveniently carried out by reacting the polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal of formula II1 or 11" with the vinylketene acetal (analogue) of formula III in an organic solvent at temperatures in the range of about -40°C to about 100°C, preferably in the temperature range of about -20°C to room temperature, and in the presence of a Lewis acid.   Suitable organic solvents are, in general, all aprotic polar or non-polar solvents.    Especially preferred among such solvents are lower aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons, e.g. n-pentane, n-hexane and cyclohexane; lower, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and chloroform; lower aliphatic and cyclic ethers, e.g. diethyl ether, tert.butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; lower aliphatic nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile; as well as aromatics, e.g. toluene. Examples of Lewis acids which can be used are zinc chloride, zinc bromide, titanium tetrachloride, lithium perchlorate, boron tri-fluoride etherate as well as iron(lll) chloride; these are generally used in catalytic amounts, conveniently in an amount of between about 0.1 and 10 mol percent based on the amount of polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal employed and preferably in a mol percent range of 1 to 3.   Moreover, about 1.1 to about 1.6 equivalents, preferably about 1.3 to about 1.4 equivalents, of vinylketene acetal (analogue) are conveniently used per equivalent of polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal.    Furthermore, the reaction is conveniently<br><br>
effected at normal pressure, although generally the pressure is not  critical.<br>
Where a vinylketene acetal of formula III in which R5 and R6 both signify Ci -6-alkyl or together form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene is used, a compound of formula IV or IV" is not produced after reacting the polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal of formula II or IT with this vinylketene acetal, but instead there is produced an intermediate of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
A, B, R1, R2 and R4 have the significances given above and<br>
R5' and R6' both signify Ci-6-alkyl or together form 1,2-ethylene<br>
or  1,3-trimethylene.<br>
Also when a vinylketene acetal of formula III in which R5 and R6 both signify tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl is used, a compound of formula IV or IV" is not produced after reaction of the polyene (di)0,0-dialkyl acetal of formula II' or II" with this vinylketene acetal, but instead in this case there is produced an intermediate of the general formula<br><br><br><br>
If desired, the respective intermediate can be isolated from the reaction mixture and subsequently hydrolyzed to the corresponding compound of formula IV or IV" [in which R7 in each case signifies Ci-6-alkyl (R5' and R6' both signify Ci-6-alkyl), 2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxy-n-propyl (R5' and R6' together form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene) or hydrogen (starting from the intermediate of formula V" or V"")].   However, it has been found to be convenient not to undertake such an isolation and subsequent hydrolysis, but to hydrolyze the intermediate in the reaction mixture immediately after completion of the reaction II7II" + III -» V/V"/V"/V"" in order in these cases to proceed to<br>
the compound of formula IV or IV" (hereinafter abbreviated to IV/IV").   Starting from an intermediate of formula V or V" the hydrolysis can be suitable effected by adding to the reaction mixture an aqueous solution of a weak acid, preferably slightly diluted aqueous acetic acid, and subsequently stirring the mixture for a time, for example about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, conveniently in the temperature range of about 0°C to room temperature.   In the other case, i.e. starting from an intermediate of formula V" or V"", the hydrolysis takes place much more readily, namely with water alone; the hydrolysis can even be effected in the course of the normal working-up, whereby water is mainly used as the purifying agent.<br>
Depending on the vinylketene acetal (analogue) of formula III which is used there is obtained, after carrying out the first process step as well as any hydrolysis which may be required, as explained in more detail above, the corresponding product of formula IV/IV", namely:<br><br>
-	after using a vinylketene acetal (analogue) of formula in in which R5 signifies Ci-6-alkyl and R6 signifies Ci-6-alkyl or tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl, a compound of formula IVVIV" in which R7 signifies  Ci-6-alkyl  (when R6  signifies tri(C-|-6-alkyl)silyl,   this group is eliminated);<br>
-	after using a vinylketene acetal analogue of formula III in which R5 and R6 both signify tri(Ci-6~alkyl)silyl, a compound of formula IVVIV" in which R7 signifies hydrogen [both tri(C-|-6-alkyl)silyl groups are eliminated and the product has one or two terminal  4-carboxy-1-(Ci-6-alkoxy)-3-butenyl group(s) or corresponding 3- and/4-methyl substituted (R1 and/or R2 = methyl) group(s) -CH(OR4)-CH2-C(R1)=C(R2)-COOH]; and<br>
-	after using a vinylketene acetal of formula III in which R5 and R6 together form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene, a compound of formula IVVIV" in which R7 signifies 2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxy-n-propyl.<br>
The respective product can be isolated from the reaction mixture and, if desired, purified in a manner known per se. Typically, the mixture is combined with water and the batch is extracted with a water-immiscible organic solvent such as, for example, with a lower alkane or dialkyl ether, e.g. n-hexane or tert.butyl methyl ether, and the organic phase is washed with water and/or saturated aqueous sodium chloride and/or sodium bicarbonate solution, dried and concentrated.   The thus-isolated and at least to some extent washed crude product can then, if desired, be purified further, for example by column chromatography, e.g. using eluents such as n-hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene or mixtures thereof, or (re)crystallization, for example from an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol.   Alternatively, and often preferably, the crude product taken up, for example, in a lower alkanol can be reacted directly in the last process step (cleavage of the alcohol R40H) of the present invention, i.e. in the sense of a "through process" 11711" + III -&gt; IVVIV" -»IVI".<br><br>
The last process step is conveniently carried out by subjecting the compound of formula IV'/IV" dissolved in a suitable organic solvent to strongly basic conditions, i.e. reacting it in the presence of a base with cleavage of the alcohol R4OH to the corresponding polyene ester or acid.   Suitable organic solvents are, in general, polar or non-polar solvents such as, for example, alcohols, aliphatic or cyclic ethers, e.g. diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, and aliphatic esters, e.g. ethyl acetate; or, respectively, aromatics, e.g. toluene, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. n-hexane, and lower halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride; or also mixtures of an alcohol with another solvent mentioned here. Where an alcohol of the formula R3OH in which R3 is different from R7 (as Ci-6-alkyl,  2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxy-n-propyl)  in the compound of formula IV'/IV" is used as the solvent, the final product of formula I' or I" has the respective ester group -COOR3 as a result of the excess amount of alcohol R3OH vis-a-vis this intermediate: in this (quite simple) manner, i.e. by trans-esterification, the ester group -COOR7 is converted into the ester group -COOR3 which is different therefrom.   Otherwise, a separate treatment, i.e. trans-esterification of the isolated product which has the ester group -COOR7 is carried out in a manner known per se in order to convert the group -COOR7 into the desired ester group -COOR3 which is different therefrom.<br>
The base which is used can be inorganic or organic, there being suitable in general strong bases such as, for example, alkali metal alcoholates, especially sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, potassium methylate, potassium ethylate and potassium tert.-butylate, as well as alkali metal hydrides, especially sodium hydride.<br>
Conveniently, at least one equivalent of base, preferably about 1.5 to about 2 equivalents, is used per equivalent of the compound of formula IV or IV".   The reaction is suitably effected in a temperature range of about 0°C to about 100°C, preferably at temperatures of about room temperature to about 50°C.   Moreover,<br><br>
the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure, although in general the pressure is not critical.<br>
It has been found to be especially advantageous to carry out the last process step using a sodium alkoxide as the base and the corresponding alkanol as the solvent at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the respective reaction mixture, preferably in a temperature range of about 40°C to about 60°C.   Conveniently, either a solution of the sodium alkoxide in the alcohol is prepared in advance or this solution is prepared freshly from metallic sodium and the alkanol.   The bringing together of the alkanolic solution of the sodium alkoxide with the solution of the compound of formula IV7IV" in the (same) alkanol, preferably likewise previously prepared, can be effected in any sequence and preferably at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture is subsequently stirred for several hours and the reaction has normally finished at the the latest after 24 hours.<br>
Irrespective of the chosen procedure for the last process step, the product can be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified in a manner known per se.   The respective working-up normally comprises neutralization of the remaining base by addition of an organic or inorganic acid such as, for example, a carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid, or an aqueous mineral acid, e.g. dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
In the particular embodiment of the procedure described above using a sodium alkoxide as the base, after completion of the reaction the mixture is conveniently cooled to room temperature or even to about 0°C and thereafter preferably neutralized with aqueous acetic acid, which normally leads to (possibly further) crystallization of the product of formula I' or I".   The crystallization can also be expedited by further cooling.   After its isolation, suitably by filtration, the product can be washed, for example with water and/or aqueous alcohol, and finally dried, optionally under reduced pressure.   If desired, further methods<br><br>
such as, for example, column chromatography and recrystal-lization can be employed in order to provide an even purer product.<br>
The cleavage of the alcohol R40H from the compound of formula IV'/IV" can also be effected under acidic conditions in order to serve as an alternative to the last process step of the process in accordance with the invention which is effected under strongly basic conditions.   After pertinent experiments to bring about this cleavage using catalytic amounts of a strong acid, e.g. p-toiuenesulphonic acid, it has been established that the cleavage actually proceeds relatively readily.    For example, when using 1 2'-methoxy-l T,1 2'-dihydro-8'-apo-p-carotenoic acid ethyl<br>
ester with a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulphonic acid in methylene chloride at about 0°C the cleavage of methanol was effected after about 30 minutes and gave crude 8'-apo-p-<br>
carotenoic acid ethyl ester in almost quantitatively yield by weight.   According to HPLC the crude product consisted to the extent of about 71.5% of the (all E) isomer and of several additional [presumably (Z)] isomers.   The absolute content of the crude product was, however, only about 37.5% according to HPLC. Possibly, a partial polymerization of the polyene system takes place under such strongly acidic conditions.   Further attempts to optimise this acid-catalyzed cleavage brought no improved results.    Surprisingly, it was established that the cleavage effected under basic conditions leads almost exclusively to the desired (all E) isomer, with almost no (Z) isomers and further undesired isomers being formed.<br>
Depending on the compound of formula IV or IV" and solvent (alcoholic or other solvent) used there is obtained after carrying out the last process step the product of formula I' or I" (abbreviated hereinafter to 171"), respectively, appropriate to the residue R3.   Where the solvent is not an alcohol (so that no trans-esterification can then take place), there is obtained:<br>
- after using a compound of formula IV'/IV" in which R7 signifies Ci-6-alkyl, a polyene ester/diester of formula I7I" in which R3 signifies the corresponding Ci-6-alkyl;<br><br>
-	after using a compound of formula IV7IV" in which R7 signifies hydrogen, a polyene acid/diacid of formula 171" in which R3 signifies hydrogen; and<br>
-	after using a compound of formula IV7IV" in which R7 signifies 2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxy-n-propyl, a polyene ester/diester of formula 171" in which R3 does not have the significance hitherto given, but signifies 2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxy-n-propyl.<br>
In each of the above three cases the residue R7 remains unaltered in the course of the last process step.<br>
On the other hand, where an alcohol, especially a C1-6-alkanol, is used as the solvent and when the three types of compounds IV7IV" are used, a trans-esterification takes place in two cases (in the first and third case) as already indicated above. In this manner there is formed in each case a polyene ester of formula I7I" in which R3 corresponds to the respective alkyl residue of the alkanol: the group -COOR7 in the compound IV7IV" is thus converted without particular measures into the group -COOR3 which is different therefrom, unless the alcoholic solvent corresponds to the alcohol R7OH.   The use of the respective alkanol R3OH is preferred for this reason and also because the product of formula I, which is difficultly soluble in the alcohol, crystallizes out from the solution already during the reaction.<br>
If desired, protecting groups (R8 and/or R9 as a protected hydroxy or oxo group) which may be present in the product of formula I' or I" obtained can be cleaved off according to methods known per se, e.g. by hydrolysis with acid or base.<br>
While some of the educts of the process in accordance with the invention are known, other precursors, which are in part known, can be produced according to methods known per se.<br><br>
Thus, for example, the polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetals of formula II' and the polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals) of formula 11" can be produced very readily in a generally known manner by reacting the polyene monoaldehyde of the formula A-CHO or polyene dialdehyde of the formula OHC-B-CHO with the respective trialkyl orthoformate, especially in the corresponding C1-6-alkanol, e.g. methanol for the 0,0-dimethyl acetal, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of an organic acid or a Lewis acid, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid or zinc chloride (see, for example, Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 6th edition, p.  377 et seq. (1963)].  The reaction takes place in suspension, i.e. the respective polyene monoaldehyde or dialdehyde is suspended in the alkanol and then conveniently about two or four mol equivalents, respectively, of the trialkyl orthoformate are added to the suspension, followed by a trace of acidic catalyst, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid.   Thereby, the monoaldehyde or dialdehyde dissolves slowly and the polyene 0,0-dialkyl acetal or di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) of formula 11711" simultaneously crystallizes out slowly.   The reaction is conveniently carried out in a temperature range of about 0°C to about 40°C, and as a rule takes about 2 to about 4 hours.   As further literature sources which illustrate the generally known acetalization method reference is made to European Patent Publications 252  389 and 391   033 as well as to J. Mol. Cat. 79, 117 et seq. (1993).<br>
The polyene monoaldehydes A-CHO and dialdehydes OHC-B-CHO in turn are either known, especially from the technical literature concerning carotenoids, or - where novel - can be produced according to methods known per se.   Thus, for example, the reaction of various Cis-Wittig salts with  2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatrienedial (the so-called "Cio-dialdehyde") to give the corresponding monoaldehydes, the reaction of various Cs-Wittig aldehydes with long-chain polyene aldehydes likewise to give such monoaldehydes as well as the two-fold reaction of the Cio-dialdehyde with C5- or Cio-Wittig aldehydes to give various dialdehydes are known from this literature.   The textbook "Carotenoids" (0. Isler, published by Birkhauser, Basel and Stuttgart, 1971), especially chapters VI and XII thereof and the<br><br>
further literature mentioned therein, provides much useful information relating to the production and the occurrence of the known monoaldehydes and dialdehydes.   Where educts which have protected hydroxy, oxo or formyl groups are used, then such "protected" educts can be produced, for example, directly from the corresponding unprotected educts according to methods known per se.<br>
The vinylketene acetals or analogues thereof of formula III are in part known compounds; the majority of these educts are, however, novel.<br>
Certain compounds of formula III in which R5 and R6 each independently signify Ci-6-alkyl are known: these are especially 1,1-dimethoxy-l ,3-butadiene  and   1,1-diethoxy-3-methyl-1,3-butadiene (formula III in which R1 and R2 both signify hydrogen and R5 and R6 both signify methyl and, respectively, R1 signifies methyl, R2 signifies hydrogen and R5 and R6 both signify ethyl). The remaining compounds of this sub-class are considered to be novel.   All of these compounds can be produced in accordance with the following Reaction Scheme starting from a nitrile of general formula VI which is known or which can be produced according to methods known per se:<br><br><br>
The reaction of the nitrile of general formula VI with the alkanol R5"OH in the presence of gaseous hydrogen chloride gives the corresponding iminoalkyl ester of general formula VII, which in most cases is present in crystalline form.   An aprotic solvent, especially a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. n-pentane or n-hexane; a lower halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride or chloroform; or a aromatic, e.g. benzene or toluene, is suitably used as the solvent.   Both the alkanol and the hydrogen chloride are conveniently used in slight excess, namely up to about 50%; preferably up to about 10 and, respectively, 20% (equivalents of alkanol and hydrogen chloride, respectively, relative to equivalents of nitrile).   The reaction is suitably effected in a temperature range of about -20°C to about +60°C, preferably in a temperature range of about 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The further reaction of the iminoalkyl ester with the alkanol R6"OH, which may if desired be different from the alkanol R5"0H, to give the orthoester of general formula VIII is conveniently effected in an aprotic solvent, e.g. one of the<br><br>
aforementioned solvents, and at temperatures in the range of about 0°C to about 60°C, preferably at room temperature.<br>
One equivalent of alkanol R6"OH can be eliminated from the orthoester of formula VIII using sodium amide in liquid ammonia as the base or solvent, with the desired vinylketene acetal of formula Ilia being obtained very easily.   Other base/solvent combinations can be used for this purpose, especially an alkali metal amide (generally) or an alkali metal alkyl, e.g. butyllithium, in each instance in a polar or apolar aprotic solvent such as, for example, a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. n-hexane, a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, or an aromatic, e.g. benzene or toluene.<br>
Of those vinylketene acetal analogues of formula III in which  R5 signifies C-|-6-alkyl and R6 signifies tri(Ci-6-alkyl)-silyl,   at   least   l-trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxy-2-methyl-l ,3-butadiene (formula III in which R1  signifies hydrogen, R2 signifies methyl,  R5 signifies ethyl and R6 signifies trimethylsilyl) is known [see, inter alia, Tetr. Lett. 2Q, 3209 et seq. (1979), Chimia 14, 265 et seq. (1980) and Tetr. Lett. 2f&gt;, 397 et seq. (1985)]. Those analogues which are novel can be produced, for example, from the corresponding alkyl 3-butenoate by reaction with lithium diisopropylamide and the corresponding trialkylsilyl chloride at low temperatures, e.g. about -70°C [see especially Tetrahedron 4^ 3455 et seq. (1984)].  The aforementioned alkyl 3-butenoates (starting materials) are, in turn, known or can be produced according to methods known per se; ethyl 2-methyl-3-butenoate can be produced, for example, by ethanolysis of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile (formula VI in which R1   signifies hydrogen and R2 signifies methyl), a byproduct in the synthesis of adiponitrile (Pinner reaction; see German Offenlegungsschrift 3,244,273 as well as US Patent 4,937,308).<br>
A further sub-class of vinylketene acetals or analogues thereof of formula III likewise includes known compounds, e.g. 1,1-di(trimethylsilyloxy)-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene   [formula  III   in which R1  signifies hydrogen, R2 signifies methyl and R5 and R6<br><br>
both signify trimethylsilyl; see J.A.C.S. 110. 5841 et seq. (1988)]. In total, this sub-class consists of vinylketene acetal analogues of formula III in which R5 and R6 both signify tri(Ci-6-alkyl)silyl. The aforementioned known analogue can be produced, for example, starting from  2-methyl-3-butenoic acid trimethylsilyl  ester by deprotonization using lithium diisopropylamide at about -75°C and subsequent reaction with trimethylsilyl chloride in accordance with the conditions given in J. Organomet. Chem. 338. 149 et seq. (1988).  The remaining analogues of this type can be produced in a similar manner.<br>
The remaining vinylketene acetals of formula III are novel compounds with three exceptions.   The exceptions are 2-alkylidene-[1,3]dioxolane,   2-(1 -methyl-allylidene)-[1,3]dioxolane and 2-(2-methyl-allylidene)-[1,3]dioxolane (formula III in which R1 and R2 both signify hydrogen, R1  signifies hydrogen and R2 signifies methyl or R1 signifies methyl and R2 signifies hydrogen, respectively, and R5 and R6 in each case together form 1,2-ethylene).   The synthesis of the second-named compound is published in Tetrahedron £(2, 5109-5118 (1994); the acetal was produced in mg amounts starting from tiglic acid, but was not isolated and was only detected by TH-NMR spectroscopy (capillary tube).   Other relevant literature sources concerning the three known vinylketene acetals are J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1(5), 1582-4 (1981) and Macromolecules 2£(1 2), 4319-4325 (1995).<br>
In general, the vinylketene acetals of this particular subclass, i.e. of formula III in which R5 and R6 together form 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-trimethylene, can be produced in accordance with the following Reaction Scheme (as in the case of Reaction Scheme 1  starting from the nitriie of formula VI):<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 have the significances given above and s signifies 2 or 3.<br>
The hydrolysis of the nitrile of general formula VI to the corresponding carboxylic acid of general formula IX and the subsequent esterification of this carboxylic acid to the ester of general formula X can in each case be carried out in a manner known per se [see, for example, Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 6th edition, p. 411 et seq. (1967) and, respectively, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd edition, p. 349 et seq. (1989)].  Then, the cyclization of the ester to the desired [1,3]dioxolane or [1,3]dioxane can be conveniently effected in an aprotic polar or non-polar solvent, especially a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. n-hexane, a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, or an aromatic, e.g. toluene, in the presence of a strong base, especially an alkali metal alkyl, e.g. methyllithium or butyllithium, an alkali metal hydride, e.g. sodium hydride or potassium hydride, or an alkali metal amide, e.g. lithium amide, sodium amide or potassium amide or lithium diisopropylamide, at temperatures in the range of about -70°C to about +100°C, preferably in a temperature range of about -30°C to about 0°C.<br><br>
In the production of the vinylketene acetals or analogues thereof described above, the product or an intermediate can in each case be isolated and purified in a manner known per se.<br>

The use of the novel final products represents a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
The invention is illustrated on the basis of the following Examples.<br><br>
A.       Production of polyene (dOO.O-dialkvl acetals (compounds of formulae II' and II")<br>
Example 1<br>
1 5-Apo-p-carotenal dimethyl acetal (vitamin A aldehyde dimethyl acetah<br>
2.84 g (10 mmol) of vitamin A aldehyde (&gt;99% pure) were placed in 30 ml of methanol and 11 ml (100 mmol, 10 eq.) of trimethyl orthoformate in a 100  ml four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer.   40 mg (0.3 mmol, 3 mol%) of anhydrous zinc chloride were added thereto at 0°C and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 3 1 /2 hours.  Then it was cooled to -40°C within one hour and filtered, and the solid was washed with a small amount of cold (at about -10°C) methanol and finally dried.   This gave 2.5  g (75% yield) of (all-E)-vitamin A aldehyde dimethyl acetal with m.p. 53-56°C; content according to HPLC: 98.4%.<br>
For analysis, a sample was recrystallized from methanol. This sample showed the following physical and analytical data: m.p. 53-55°C; content according to HPLC: 99.7%; UV (n-hexane): 324 nm (log e = 4.70; E^ =1520).<br>

50 g (0.14 mol) of 1 2'-apo-p-carotenal and 31 ml (30.1 g, 0.28 mol) of freshly distilled trimethyl orthoformate in 500 ml of methanol were placed in a 1.5 I four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer.   A solution of 1 6  mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in 4 ml of methanol was then added at room<br><br>
temperature to the resulting suspension.   Thereby, the red crystals dissolved for the most part within 20 minutes; subsequently an orange precipitate began to form.   After stirring at room temperature for 2 hours the mixture was cooled to about +5°C, 0.5  ml of triethylamine was added, the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 5  minutes, suction filtered (pressure suction filter, under argon), and the solid washed with a small amount of cold (-1 0°C) methanol and dried at room temperature for about 1 6 hours under reduced pressure (water-jet vacuum).   This gave 52.3 g (90.5% yield) of 1 2'-apo-|3-carotenal dimethyl acetal as an orange<br>

6.25 g (15 mmol) of 8'-apo-p-carotenal and 6.6 ml (6.4 g, 60 mmol, 4 eq.) of trimethyl orthoformate in 200 ml of methanol were placed in a 350 ml four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer. A solution of 20 mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in 10 ml of methanol was added thereto at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 2 1/2 hours.   Thereby, the red crystals dissolved slowly and an orange crystallizate began to form.   Then 2  ml of triethylamine were added, the mixture was cooled to 0°C within about 30 minutes and suction filtered, and the solid was washed with a small amount of cold (-10°C) methanol and dried briefly under reduced pressure (water-jet vacuum).   After 30 minutes this gave 11.6 g of methanol-moist acetal with a content of 94.8% according to HPLC.   For recrystallization, the crystals were dissolved in 200 ml of diethyl ether and then 600 ml of methanol were added thereto<br><br>
within 1  1/2 hours, the mixture was cooled to 0°C and the crystals were filtered off and dried at room temperature under reduced pressure (water-jet vacuum) and briefly under a high vacuum.   This gave 5.9 g (84% yield) of 8'-apo-p-carotenal<br>

10 g (20.7 mmol) 4'-apo-p-carotenal and 35 ml (0.31 mol, about 1 5 eq.) of trimethyl orthoformate in 250 ml of methanol were placed in a 500 ml four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, argon gasification and a thermometer. A solution of 25  mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in 15 ml of methanol was added at room temperature to the resulting dark red suspension, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes, then at 30-35°C for 1 1/2 hours; the dark red suspension changed to a brown suspension.   Subsequently, 2  ml of triethylamine were added and the mixture was cooled to 0°C.   The precipitated crude product was filtered off under suction, washed with a small amount of cold methanol and dried briefly at room temperature under reduced pressure.   The thus-obtained methanol-moist product (about 17.8 g; content according to HPLC: 91%) was dissolved in 600 ml of diethyl ether with slight warming and treated at room temperature within<br>
1	hour with 1   I of methanol (containing 2%o triethylamine).   Then the mixture was suction filtered and the residue was washed with a small amount of cold (0°C) methanol.   This gave, after drying at room temperature and under reduced pressure for<br>
2	hours, 9.3 g (80.5% yield) of 4'-apo-p-carotenal dimethyl<br>
acetal as violet crystals with a content of 94.7% according to HPLC.<br><br>
For the analytical data, a sample was recrystallized from diethyl ether (dissolved while warming and cooled to 0°C): content according to HPLC: 95.7%; m.p. 186-188°C; UV (dioxan): 500 nm (log e = 4.93; E,1*^ = 1 623), 468 nm (log e = 4.99; E^*, = 1837), 283 nm (log e = 4.37; E^*, =444).<br>

32.8 g (0.2 mol) of Cin-dialdehyde and 65 g of trimethyl orthoformate in 250 ml of methanol were placed in a 500 ml round flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and argon gasification.    100 mg of p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate were added thereto at about 20°C, which produced a slightly exothermic reaction.   The reaction mixture was held at about 20-25°C using a cold water bath.   The suspension dissolved in about 5  minutes.   Then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour and about 0.5  ml of triethylamine was subsequently added.   The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the separated crystal slurry was dissolved in 200 ml of hot n-hexane, filtered while hot through cotton wool and left to stand.   The solution was left to stand at -20°C in a deep freezer for about 1 6 hours, the resulting crystals were filtered off, washed with n-hexane at -20°C and dried to constant weight under a water-jet vacuum.   This gave 42.7 g (80% yield) of Cio-dialdehyde dimethyl acetal as pale yellow crystals with m.p. 68-69°C and a content according to gas chromatography (GC) of about 96%); UV (ethanol): 292 nm (log e = 4.61; E^ = 1602), 280 nm (log £ = 4.72; E^ = 2046), 260 nm (log e = 4.59; E^*, =<br>

20.0 g (67.5 mmol) of crocetin dialdehyde (m.p. 196-197°C) and 40 g (0.37 mol) of trimethyl orthoformate in 350 ml of methanol were placed in a 500 ml round flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and argon gasification.   200 mg of p-toluene-sulphonic acid monohydrate were added thereto at room temperature while stirring and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 45 minutes and at 35-40°C for about 1 1/2 hours, which gave a yellow-orange suspension.   Then the mixture was cooled to 0°C, filtered and the residue was washed with cold methanol (-10°C).  This gave 24.7 g (92% yield) of crocetin dialdehyde dimethyl acetal as an orange powder, m.p. 136°C, with a content of 97.4% according to HPLC.   Recrystallization from 1 50 ml of hot ethyl acetate and 150 ml of methanol while cooling to -20°C gave, after filtration and drying (water-jet vacuum, followed by high vacuum), 23.3 g (86% yield) of crocetin dialdehyde dimethyl acetal as rust-red crystals, m.p. 138-139°C, with a content of 97.3% according to HPLC; UV (ethanol): 422 nm (log e = 5.12; E^ = 3416), 397 nm (log e = 5.11; E^*, =3305), 377 nm (log e = 4.89; E^*, = 1985), 232 nm (log e = 4.20; E^*, = 405).

a)       2-Methvl-3-buteniminoic acid methvl ester hydrochloride<br><br>
1 73 g (220 ml, 5.4 mol, 1.1 eq.) of methanol in 2.5 I of toluene and 2.5 I of n-hexane were placed in a 6 I four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a gas inlet tube (for argon gasification).   216 g (5.92  mol, 1.2 eq.) of gaseous hydrogen chloride (dried over concentrated sulphuric acid) were introduced at 0°C (bath temperature -10°C) and while stirring within 1  1/2 hours.   Then 500 g (4.9  mol, 1 eq.) of 80% 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile were added thereto at between 0 and 5°C within 45  minutes, the ice bath was replaced by a cool (20°C) water bath and the mixture was stirred further at room temperature for about 20  hours.   The separated precipitate was cooled (ice bath) for 1   hour, filtered off under suction, washed with 1   I of n-hexane and dried at room temperature for 18 hours under reduced pressure (water-jet vacuum).   This gave   594 g (81% yield) of 2-methyl-3-buten-iminoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride with m.p. 106°C (with decomposition).<br>
b)       2-Methvl-3-butenoic acid orthomethvl ester<br>
297 g (2  mol) of 2-methyl-3-buteniminoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride were dissolved at room temperature in 1   I of methanol in a Kutscher-Steudel apparatus (2.5  I content, 1   I round flask for pentane collection).   This solution was then extracted continuously with 2 I of n-pentane over about 24 hours, with the methanol phase being stirred magnetically. Thereby, ammonium chloride separated.   Subsequently, the pentane in the round flask (about 600-700 ml) was concentrated. This gave 234 g of crude 2-methyl-3-butenoic acid orthomethyl ester with a content of 66% according to GC.<br>
A repetition of this procedure on the same scale gave 236 g of crude product with a content of 70% according to GC.  The two crude products were combined (total 470 g) and fractionated at 30 mbar on a Vigreux column (20 cm, metallized).   310 g (43% yield) of 2-methyl-3-butenoic acid orthomethyl ester with a content of 89.5% according to GC were obtained at a boiling temperature of 65-66°C/30  mbar.<br><br>
c)       1.1 -Dimethoxv-2-methvl-1.3-butadiene<br>
About 600 ml of liquid ammonia were condensed at -70°C using an ascending tube in a 1.5 I four-necked sulphonation flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel and argon gasification.    1  spatula tip of iron(lll) nitrate was added to the condensate.  Thereafter, 21   g (0.91   mol, 3.2 eq.) of sodium metal were added within 30 minutes and the mixture was stirred at -45 to -65°C, which gave a dark grey suspension. A solution of 50.8 g (0.284 mol) of 2-methyl-3-butenoic acid orthomethyl ester with a content of 89.5% according to GC in 200 ml of diethyl ether was then added dropwise at -45 to -40°C within 1   hour, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at -45°C/1 hour.   Thereafter, the cooling was removed and the ammonia was evaporated within 2 hours (water bath/20°C). After the addition of 200 ml of diethyl ether 100 ml of water were cautiously added dropwise at between 0 and 20°C, the aqueous phase was separated and again extracted twice with two 1 50 ml portions, a total of 300 ml, of n-pentane.   After the addition of 40 mg of 2,6-di-tert.butyl-p-cresol the combined extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated cautiously at 25-30°C under reduced pressure.   This gave 37.3 g of crude 1,1-dimethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene with a content of 95% according to GC.   Distillation on a 10 cm Vigreux column at 20 mbar gave, at a boiling temperature of 48°C, 34.2 g (90.2% yield) of 1,1-dimethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene with a content of 96% according to GC as a colourless liquid, which, after the addition of 35 mg (1%o) of 2,6-di-tert.butyl-p-cresol, was stored at 0°C under argon.<br>

mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, two dropping funnels and argon gasification.    113  ml (181   mmol, 1.1 eq.) of a butyllithium solution (1.6M in n-hexane) were added dropwise thereto at -25°C within 45  minutes, the mixture was then cooled to -70°C and a solution of 21.2 g (165  mmol) of ethyl 2-methyl-3-butenoate [see German Offenlegungsschrift 3,244,273 as well as US Patent 4,937,308] with a content of 100% according to GC in 30 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran (distilled over UAIH4) was added dropwise thereto within 30 minutes.   Then the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at -70°C and subsequently at this temperature 25.1   ml (= 21.6 g, 0.199 mol, 1.2 eq.) of trimethyl-chlorosilane were added dropwise thereto.   The cooling bath was now removed, so that the temperature rose from -70°C to room temperature within about 2 1/2 hours.   Then the mixture was suction filtered over Celite® (a filter aid consisting of kieselguhr; Manville Corp., USA), rinsed with tetrahydrofuran, a small amount (about 100 mg) of 2,6-di-tert.butyl-p-cresol was added and the mixture was concentrated cautiously at 40°C under reduced pressure.   The residue was taken up in n-pentane and the solution was filtered and concentrated.   Distillation under a high vacuum (0.25 mbar) gave, at a boiling temperature of 28°C (while cooling well), 25.8  g (73% yield) of (E/Z)-1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxy-2-methyl-1,3-butadiene with a content of 94% according toGC.<br>

The filtrate was washed in<br><br>
succession with 200 ml of 0.5N aqueous hydrochloric acid, 100 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution.   The organic solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and, after concentration, the product was distilled on a Vigreux column (20 cm) at 80-81 °C/10 mbar.   This gave 62.3 g (83% yield) of 2-methyl-but-3-enoic acid 2-chloroethyl ester as a colourless oil with a content of 97.5% according to GC.<br>

90.6 g (about 113  ml) of 20% potassium hydride in oil (density about 0.8) were washed twice with n-hexane under argon, and then treated with 700 ml of dimethoxyethane.   Subsequently, a solution of 56.5 g (0.34 mol) of 2-methyl-but-3-enoic acid 2-chloroethyl ester with a content of 97.5% according to GC in 175  ml of dimethoxyethane was added thereto while stirring at 20°C within 1  1/2 hours, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.   250 ml of water were cautiously added dropwise thereto at 0-5°C.   The aqueous phase was then separated and extracted three times with three 300 ml portions, a total of 900 ml, of n-hexane.   Washing of the combined organic phases with 250 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, drying and concentration gave a yellow liquid (50.5 g; GC: 83.4%), which, after the addition of 40  mg of 2,6-di-tert.butyl-p-cresol, was fractionated on a Vigreux column (20 cm).   This gave, at a boiling temperature of 93-94°C/19 mbar, 28.22 g (66% yield) of 2-(1-methyl-allylidene)-[1,3]dioxolane as a colourless oil with a content of 100% according to GC.<br>
