A MULTILAYER THERMOFORMABLE PACKAGING LAMINATE<br>
BILCARE LIMTIED,<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of 1028, Shiroli, Rajgurunagar (Taluka Khed), Pune 411 505,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-layer film laminates. Particularly, the present invention relates to multi-layer film laminates suitable for use in the pharmaceutical packaging industry.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Today, a significant fraction of healthcare products are packed in blisters. Amongst many other advantages, blister packaging offers convenience in terms of portability and also helps to protect the packaged drug over a longer shelf life. One way to form blisters is by thermoforming a rigid polymer film.<br>
Blister packaging has proven to be a highly effective and successful packaging form for the pharmaceutical industry. Not only does it instill confidence regarding the quality and purity of a product, it also provides the manufacturer with a surface upon which information may be provided to the consumer.<br>
Counterfeiting is a severe problem for all industries including the pharmaceutical industry. Legitimate businesses are losing millions due to counterfeit activity. The International chamber of commerce estimates that US $ 900 Billion are lost by businesses worldwide. This translates to 10-30 % of the sales being lost to counterfeiters, forgers and duplicators. In some countries the figure in percentage is much higher.<br>
Counterfeiting is the fastest growing crime in the world. Studies show that consumers   would   prefer   to   buy   products   that   are   in   tamper   evident<br><br><br>
authenticated packaging so as to reduce the chance of buying imitation products.<br>
However, with the growing counterfeiting problem, that the pharmaceutical industry has to tackle (research by the World Health Organization shows that approximately 5% of the world's medicines are counterfeit, and in some areas this percentage can be as high as 50%), leading brands are prone to be attacked by unscrupulous individuals. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer or brand owner to ensure that a genuine unadulterated product reaches the consumer.<br>
Blister packaging, which is prone to counterfeiting, appears to be losing its 'sheen'. It can be a viable proposition if it evolves such that it is impossible for a counterfeiter to duplicate.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The present invention therefore has as an object a packaging film which will help against counterfeiting. Another object of this invention is to provide a packaging film which will act as a protective authentication and by which a lay person can easily indentify the product at a display counter and distinguish it from a fake.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a multilayered thermoformable transparent non uniform metal sulphide or metal oxide coated polymeric laminate. A multilayer thermoformable laminate of thickness between 10 - 150 microns comprising a non uniform embossed metal sulphide or metal oxide coated polymeric film having first and second surfaces and at least one rigid thermoformable polymeric base of thickness between 50 - 1000 microns laminated to the non uniform embossed metallized film.<br>
The present invention is now described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention. In the case of any inconsistencies, the present disclosure, including any definitions therein will prevail.<br>
The term "coating" as used in the present text includes applying, layering and pressing or deposition of metal by vacuum evaporation process.<br><br><br>
The expression "a multi-layer laminate" as used in the present invention includes a multi-layer laminate comprising a thermoformable non uniform embossed metal sulphide or metal oxide coated polymer based laminate. The expression "a multi-layer laminate" as used in the present invention also includes a laminate comprising a thermoformable non uniform embossed metallised film laminated with at least one rigid thermoformable polymer with the help of a suitable polymeric adhesive.<br>
The thickness of individual layers in the multi-layer laminate can vary depending on specific intended use and also on the ease of operation. Also, the multi-layer laminate may additionally comprise additional layers of polymer, resin or other substances, if desired.<br>
Before coating adhesive to the first surface of the rigid polymeric substrate, the rigid thermoformable polymeric film can be pretreated, to impart uniformity or improve the adhesion of the coated material.<br>
In a typical process for preparation of a multi-layer laminate according to the present invention, the non uniform embossed metallised film of thickness between 10-150 microns having first and second surfaces is first prepared. The first surface of the substrate is coated with metal sulphide or metal oxide by vacuum evaporation/deposition technique. The non uniform embossed metal sulphide or metal oxide coated film is initially coated with suitable primer for assuring uniform coating and proper adhesion of the metal oxide/sulphide on the polymeric film during vacuum evaporation. The metallized thermoformable film is then subjected to non uniform embossing with a desired art work and design. Optionally coloring of the metallized film can be done to get a coloured<br><br><br>
metallized non uniform embossed metallized film. To achieve coloration of the metallized film, the former film is coated with a desired coloured lacquer of thickness 0.5 to 1.5 microns. The application of the colored lacquer can be done before the metallization process or after the metallization process of the polymeric film. Then, the coloured/ without colour metallized polymeric film is subjected to non uniform embossing with a predetermined art work design. The other side of this film is coated with a suitable adhesive of thickness between 0.5-8 microns and laminated with a rigid polymeric base having thickness between 50 to 1000 micron. The adhesive helps to fix the coloured/ without coloured metallized non uniform embossed metallized film to the rigid polymeric base on the second surface of the non uniform embossed metallized polymeric film efficiently. A wide variety of adhesives can be advantageously used according to the present invention. Preferably, the adhesive comprises a polymeric substance capable of undergoing polymerization at higher temperatures. The adhesive coat can be applied by several methods typically known to a person skilled in the art and includes coating and spraying. The wet adhesive coat is then pressed with the desired polymer film. If desired, before applying the colored/ without coloured non uniform embossed metallized film, the adhesive coat is partially dried. Such partial drying at elevated temperature removes volatile components. Once the desired polymer film is applied on the adhesive coat, say by pressing, the laminate may further be subjected to heat treatment. When the adhesive coat comprises a polymerizable substance, the curing of this polymerizable substance occurs through further polymerization, thereby imparting further adhesive strength. However, the post-heat treatment is optional and entirely depends on several parameters such as the nature of the individual constituents and the final properties desired.<br><br><br>
A wide variety of polymer films can be used for the thermoformable non uniform embossed metallized film according to the present invention. Typical non-limiting examples of such film include metallized color film such as a metallized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film or high density polyethylene (HDPE) or low density polyethylene (LDPE) or polypropylene (PP) or amorphous polyethylene terephthalate (APET) and co-polymer of PET with glycol (PETg). The colored film may be obtained commercially or prepared by metallizing a desired polymer film with a suitable metal like aluminum, silver, gold, through known a metallization process, such as for example, vacuum deposition.<br>
Thus the obtained multi-layer laminate having a colored film which is metallized and embossed with a pre determined pattern and having non uniform thickness is laminated with the rigid thermoformable polymeric base .. As mentioned earlier, the thickness of individual layers, including those of the rigid polymeric base, adhesive coat and colored metallized non uniform embossed metallized film can be selected from within a wide range, depending on the specific intended use and/or operational ease.<br>
The multi-layer laminates according to the present invention have excellent bursting strength, barrier properties and deformation resistance. Advantageously, the laminates according to the present invention have high abrasion resistance and also can withstand thermoforming processes without any damage to the non uniform embossed metallized design during the process of thermoforming the film in to blisters packaging. Further, the multilayered thermofromable non uniform embossed metallized film can act against counterfeiting effectively.<br><br><br>
From the foregoing description, it will thus be evident that the present invention provides novel multi-layer laminates comprising thermoformable ed non uniform embossed metallized layered polymeric films and at least one rigid polymeric base and a method for their preparation. While certain embodiments of the invention have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of examples only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions. Variations or modifications to the design and construction of this invention, within the scope of the invention, may occur to those skilled in the art upon reviewing the disclosure herein. Such variations or modifications are well within the spirit of this invention. The accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A 35 micron pharmaceutical grade PVC film devoid of plasticizer having 600 mm width was subjected to an unwinder of a gravure coating machine. Ester -acrylic based primer from Magma Polymers Private Limited having viscosity of 26 to 32 sec. was applied using the gravure roller to the PVC film and extra primer was removed by doctoring process. Deposition of this primer had a thickness of 0.8 microns. Then this film was allowed to travel through on-line ovens via a conveyer. The oven temperature was set at a temperature of 75° C and the speed of 30 m/min for drying the primer on the film was maintained. The drying of the primer on the film was confirmed by non tackiness and by non blocking of the rewinding at the re winder roller.<br><br><br>
The two layer film formed above was then transferred to a vacuum deposition machine. This machine had an in situ plasma device and was fitted with an evaporation boat in which the material to be deposited was placed. The primer coated surface of the laminated film was first treated with plasma and thereafter was deposited with zinc silphide having 99.99% purity. Thickness of this deposited layer was 0.025 microns. The thickness was achieved by adjusting the speed, height of the gun and the vacuum level.<br>
This three layer film was exposed to a differential embossing grating process. A custom built machine was used for the embossing process. The three layered film was placed on an unwinder of this custom made machine, the film was passed through the roller having temperature of 130 to 150° C by which the film was softened. A diamond pattern shim was pressed on the metallized side of the film to create a diffraction grating embossed effect on the film. The shim made for the above purpose was cut with a diamond pattern by using a computerized laser cutting mechanism to avoid duplication of the pattern by any one else. The other side of this film was then laminated to a 250 micron rigid PVC base by applying an adhesive between 0.5 to 8 microns through the gravure lamination technique.<br>
Blisters packs were formed from this laminate by the thermoforming process which showed excellent thermoforming performance and showed the fine diamond non uniform embossed metallized pattern even after the thermoforming process.<br>

A 50 micron pharmaceutical grade PVC film roll devoid of plasticizer having 600 mm width was subjected to un winder of gravure coating machine . A coloured lacquer was then applied to this film having thickness of 4 micron<br><br><br>
with the help of gravure technology then after second pass the Ester -acrylic based special primer from Magma Polymers Private Limited having viscosity of 26 to 32 sec. was applied using gravure roller to this PVC film and extra primer was removed by doctoring process. Deposition of this primer had a thickness of 0.8 microns. Then this film was allowed to travel through on line ovens via a conveyer at a temperature of 75° C at the speed of 30 m/min. The drying of the film was ensured by non tacky and non blocking rewinding at the rewinder roller.<br>
Thus the two layer laminate film formed above was then transferred to a vacuum deposition machine. This machine had an in situ plasma device and was fitted with an evaporating boat in which the material to be deposited was placed. The primer coated surface of above laminated film was first treated with plasma and thereafter deposited with a zinc sulphide layer having 99.99% purity, thickness of this deposited layer was 0.020 microns. The thickness was achieved by adjusting the speed, height of gun and vacuum level. Further, this three layer laminated film was exposed to differential embossing grating process. Custom made machine was used for embossing process. The three layered laminated film was then placed on un winder of this custom made machine, the film then was passed through a roller having temperature of 130 to 150° C by which the film was getting soften, then diamond pattern shim was pressed on the metallized side of the laminate to create a diffraction grating on the film. The shim made for the above purpose was cut with a diamond pattern by using computerized laser cutting mechanism to avoid duplication of the pattern by any one else. Then this film was laminated to 200 micron PVC base devoid of plasticizer and having a vinyl chloride monomer concentration of less than 1 ppm and global migration less than 60 ppm.<br><br><br>
Blister packs were formed from this film by thermoforming process which<br>
showed excellent thermoforming performance and showed a fine diamond non<br>
uniform embossed metallized pattern even after the thermoforming process.<br>
