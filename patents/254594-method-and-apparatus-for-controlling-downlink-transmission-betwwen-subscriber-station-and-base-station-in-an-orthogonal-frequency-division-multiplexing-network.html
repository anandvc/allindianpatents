				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CHANNEL ESTIMATION IN A<br>
DELAY DIVERSITY WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications and, more<br>
specifically, to an apparatus and method for performing channel estimation in an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) network or an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) networks<br>
and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network are able to<br>
improve the reliability of the channel by spreading and/or coding data traffic and<br>
control signals over multiple subcarriers (i.e., tones). However, if the channel is flat,<br>
frequency diversity cannot be achieved. In order to overcome this, it is possible to<br>
introduce artificial frequency diversity into the transmitted signal. A technique for<br>
artificially introducing frequency diversity into an OFDM environment was disclosed<br>
in U.S Patent Application Serial No. 11/327,799, filed on January 6, 2006 and<br>
incorporated by reference above. In the device disclosed in Serial No. 11/327,799,<br>
multiple copies of the same OFDM symbol are delayed by different delay values, then<br>
amplified by the same or different gain values, and then transmitted from different<br>
antennas. This artificially introduces frequency-selective fading in the OFDM<br>
channel, thereby allowing frequency selectivity to be exploited using<br>
frequency-domain scheduling for low-to-medium speed mobile devices or frequency<br>
diversity for higher speed mobile devices.<br>
However, when selecting the symbol processing parameters (i.e., delay values<br>
and the gain values) applied to the OFDM symbols, it is important to take into<br>
consideration the user channel type and the mobile speed. To accomplish this, channel<br>
estimation is performed and the symbol processing parameters are determined based<br>
on the channel estimates and mobile speed. Therefore, there is a need for improved<br>
apparatuses and methods for performing channel estimation in an OFDM wireless<br>
network that artificially introduces frequency diversity by delaying and amplifying<br>
multiple copies of the same OFDM symbol and then transmitting the delayed and<br><br>
amplified OFDM symbols from different transmit antennas.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method of controlling downlink transmissions to a subscriber station is<br>
provided for use in a subscriber station capable of communicating with a base station<br>
of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) network. The method<br>
comprises the steps of: receiving a first pilot signal from a first antenna of the base<br>
station; receiving a second pilot signal from a second antenna of the base station;<br>
estimating the channel between the base station and subscriber station based on the<br>
received first and second pilot signals; determining a set of OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters based on the step of estimating the channel, wherein the OFDM symbol<br>
processing parameters are usable by the base station to control the relative gains and<br>
the relative delays of OFDM symbols transmitted from the first and second antennas;<br>
and transmitting the OFDM symbol processing parameter set to the base station.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a subscriber station<br>
capable of communicating with a base station of an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing (OFDM) network is provided. The subscriber station comprises: receive<br>
path circuitry capable of receiving a first pilot signal from a first antenna of the base<br>
station and receiving a second pilot signal from a second antenna of the base station;<br>
and channel estimating circuitry capable of estimating the channel between the base<br>
station and subscriber station based on the received first and second pilot signals and<br>
capable of determining a set of OFDM symbol processing parameters based on a<br>
channel quality estimate. The OFDM symbol processing parameters are usable by the<br>
base station to control the relative gains and the relative delays of OFDM symbols<br>
transmitted from the first and second antennas and wherein the subscriber station is<br>
capable of transmitting the OFDM symbol processing parameters to the base station.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a base station is<br>
provided for use in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) network.<br>
The base station comprises: 1) receive path circuitry capable of receiving an uplink<br>
signal from a subscriber station, estimating the channel between the base station and<br>
subscriber station based on the received uplink signal, and determining a set of OFDM<br>
symbol processing parameters based on a channel quality estimate; and 2) transmit<br>
path circuitry capable of using the OFDM symbol processing parameters to control the<br>
relative gains and the relative delays of processed OFDM symbols transmitted from a<br><br>
first antenna and a second antenna of the base station. The base station is capable of<br>
transmitting the OFDM symbol processing parameters to the subscriber station. The<br>
OFDM symbol processing parameters are based on the multipath characteristics and<br>
the frequency selectivity characteristics of the channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURES 1 through 8, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to<br>
describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of<br>
illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present<br>
disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged wireless network.<br>
The present disclosure is directed to apparatuses and algorithms for channel<br>
estimation and channel quality estimation for demodulation and data rate selection in<br>
an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless network that uses<br>
delayed diversity. Such a delayed diversity wireless network was disclosed previously<br>
U.S Patent Application Serial No. 11/327,799, incorporated by reference above. The<br>
present disclosure uses a number of factors, including user channel type and mobile<br><br>
speed, to select OFDM symbol processing parameters (i.e., delays D1, D2,..., DP and<br>
gains g0, g1, ..., gP) for OFDM symbols transmitted from up to P antennas (i.e., ANT1<br>
to ANTP). Therefore, different OFDM symbol processing parameters may be used to<br>
transmit to different mobile devices that are scheduled simultaneously, depending<br>
upon their channel types.<br>
It is noted that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless networks. The present disclosure<br>
is also applicable to orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless<br>
networks. However, for simplicity and brevity, the embodiments described below are<br>
directed to OFDM wireless networks, except where otherwise noted or where the<br>
context indicates otherwise.<br>
For relatively low-speed mobile devices, it is usually possible to track changes in<br>
the channel, thereby allowing channel sensitive scheduling to improve performance.<br>
Thus, the OFDM symbol processing parameters may be selected in such a way that<br>
relatively large coherence bandwidth results. That is, a relatively larger number of<br>
subcarriers experience similar fading. This goal may be achieved by keeping the<br>
delays for OFDM symbols from different antennas relatively small. A mobile device<br>
may then be scheduled on a subband consisting of contiguous subcarriers.<br>
For relatively high-speed mobile devices, channel quality variations cannot be<br>
tracked accurately, so that frequency-diversity may be helpful. Thus, the OFDM<br>
symbol processing parameters are selected in such a way that relatively small<br>
coherence bandwidth results. That is, potentially independent fading may occur from<br>
subcarrier to subcarrier. This goal may be achieved by having relatively large delays<br>
for OFDM symbols transmitted from different antennas.<br>
The symbol processing parameters may also be selected based on the degree of<br>
frequency-selectivity already present in the channel. For example, if a channel already<br>
has a lot of multipath effects and is, therefore, frequency selective, there may be little<br>
or no need for additional frequency selectivity. The OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters may be selected on a user-by-user basis because different mobile devices<br>
experience different channel types.<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) wireless network 100, which is capable of performing channel estimation<br>
according to the principles of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
wireless network 100 includes base station (BS) 101, base station (BS) 102, base<br>
station (BS) 103, and other similar base stations (not shown). Base station 101 is in<br><br>
communication with base station 102 and base station 103. Base station 101 is also in<br>
communication with Internet 130 or a similar IP-based network (not shown).<br>
Base station 102 provides wireless broadband access (via base station 101) to<br>
Internet 130 to a first plurality of subscriber stations within coverage area 120 of base<br>
station 102. The first plurality of subscriber stations includes subscriber station 111,<br>
which may be located in a small business (SB), subscriber station 112, which may be<br>
located in an enterprise (E), subscriber station 113, which may be located in a WiFi<br>
hotspot (HS), subscriber station 114, which may be located in a first residence (R),<br>
subscriber station 115, which may be located in a second residence (R), and subscriber<br>
station 116, which may be a mobile device (M), such as a cell phone, a wireless laptop,<br>
a wireless PDA, or the like.<br>
Base station 103 provides wireless broadband access (via base station 101) to<br>
Internet 130 to a second plurality of subscriber stations within coverage area 125 of<br>
base station 103. The second plurality of subscriber stations includes subscriber<br>
station 115 and subscriber station 116. In an exemplary embodiment, base stations<br>
101-103 may communicate with each other and with subscriber stations 111-116 using<br>
OFDM or OFDMA techniques.<br>
Base station 101 may be in communication with either a greater number or a<br>
lesser number of base stations. Furthermore, while only six subscriber stations are<br>
depicted in FIGURE 1, it is understood that wireless network 100 may provide<br>
wireless broadband access to additional subscriber stations. It is noted that subscriber<br>
station 115 and subscriber station 116 are located on the edges of both coverage area<br>
120 and coverage area 125. Subscriber station 115 and subscriber station 116 each<br>
communicate with both base station 102 and base station 103 and may be said to be<br>
operating in handoff mode, as known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Subscriber stations 111-116 may access voice, data, video, video conferencing,<br>
and/or other broadband services via Internet 130. In an exemplary embodiment, one<br>
or more of subscriber stations 111-116 may be associated with an access point (AP) of<br>
a WiFi WLAN. Subscriber station 116 may be any of a number of mobile devices,<br>
including a wireless-enabled laptop computer, personal data assistant, notebook,<br>
handheld device, or other wireless-enabled device. Subscriber stations 114 and 115<br>
may be, for example, a wireless-enabled personal computer (PC), a laptop computer,<br>
a gateway, or another device.<br>
FIGURE 2A is a high-level diagram of the transmit path in orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) transmitter 200 according to an exemplary<br><br>
embodiment of the disclosure. FIGURE 2B is a high-level diagram of the receive path<br>
in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver 250 according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. OFDM transmitter 200 comprises<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulator 205, serial-to-parallel (S-to-P)<br>
block 210, Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) block 215, parallel-to-serial<br>
(P-to-S) block 220, add cyclic prefix block 225, and OFDM symbol processing block<br>
230. OFDM receiver 250 comprises remove cyclic prefix block 260, serial-to-parallel<br>
(S-to-P) block 265, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block 270, parallel-to-serial<br>
(P-to-S) block 275, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) demodulator 280, and<br>
channel estimation block 285.<br>
At least some of the components in FIGURES 2A and 2B may be implemented<br>
in software while other components may be implemented by configurable hardware or<br>
a mixture of software and configurable hardware. In particular, it is noted that the FFT<br>
blocks and the IFFT blocks described in FIGURES 2A and 2B may be implemented<br>
as configurable software algorithms, where the values of FFT and IFFT sizes may be<br>
modified according to the implementation.<br>
QAM modulator 205 receives a stream of input data and modulates the input bits<br>
(or symbols) to produce a sequence of frequency-domain modulation symbols.<br>
Serial-to-parallel block 210 converts (i.e., de-multiplexes) the serial QAM symbols to<br>
parallel data to produce M parallel symbol streams where M is the IFFT/FFT size used<br>
in OFDM transmitter 200 and OFDM receiver 250. IFFT block 215 then performs an<br>
IFFT operation on the M parallel symbol streams to produce time-domain output<br>
signals. Parallel-to-serial block 220 converts (i.e., multiplexes) the parallel<br>
time-domain output symbols from IFFT block 215 to produce a serial time-domain<br>
signal.<br>
Add cyclic prefix block 225 then inserts a cyclic prefix to each OFDM symbol in<br>
the time-domain signal. As is well known, the cyclic prefix is generated by copying<br>
the last G samples of an N sample OFDM symbol and appending the copied G samples<br>
to the front of the OFDM symbol. Finally, OFDM symbol processing block 230<br>
processes the incoming OFDM symbols as described in FIGURE 3 and as described in<br>
U.S Patent Application Serial No. 11/327,799. The process OFDM samples at the<br>
output of OFDM symbol processing block 230 are then sent to up-conversion circuitry<br>
(not shown) prior to being transmitted from multiples transmit antennas.<br>
The transmitted RF signal arrives at OFDM receiver 250 after passing through<br>
the wireless channel and reverse operations to those in OFDM transmitter 200 are<br><br>
performed. Remove cyclic prefix block 260 removes the cyclic prefix to produce the<br>
serial time-domain baseband signal. Serial-to-parallel block 265 converts the<br>
time-domain baseband signal to parallel time domain signals. FFT block 270 then<br>
performs an FFT algorithm to produce M parallel frequency-domain signals.<br>
Parallel-to-serial block 275 converts the parallel frequency-domain signals to a<br>
sequence of QAM data symbols. QAM demodulator 280 then demodulates the QAM<br>
symbols to recover the original input data stream. Channel estimation block 285 also<br>
receives the QAM data symbols from parallel-to-serial block 275 and performs<br>
channels estimation. As will be described below in greater detail, the channel<br>
estimation values are used to determine a parameter set of gain values and delay values<br>
that are used in OFDM symbol processing block 230 in OFDM transmitter 200 and are<br>
used by QAM demodulator 280 to demodulate the QAM data symbols.<br>
The exemplary transmit path of OFDM transmitter 200 may be representative<br>
of the transmit paths of any one of base stations 101-103 or any one of subscriber<br>
stations 111-116. Similarly, the exemplary receive path of OFDM receiver 250 may<br>
be representative of the transmit paths of any one of base stations 101-103 or any one<br>
of subscriber stations 111-116. However, since multiple antenna configurations are<br>
more common in base stations than in subscriber stations or other mobile devices, for<br>
the sake of simplicity and clarity, the descriptions that follow will be directed toward<br>
transactions between a base station (e.g., BS 102) that implements a transmit path<br>
similar to OFDM transmitter 200 and a subscriber station (e.g., SS 116) that<br>
implements a receive path similar to OFDM receiver 250. However, such an<br>
exemplary embodiment should not be construed to limit the scope of the present<br>
disclosure. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in cases where<br>
multiple antennas are implemented in a subscriber station, the transmit path and the<br>
receiver path of both the base station and the subscriber station may be implemented<br>
as in shown in FIGURES 2A and 2B.<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates OFDM symbol processing block 230 in greater detail<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. OFDM symbol<br>
processing block 230 comprises P delay elements, including exemplary delay<br>
elements 311 and 312, P+1 amplifiers, including exemplary amplifiers 321, 322 and<br>
323, and P+l transmit antennas, including exemplary antennas 331, 332 and 333.<br>
Delay elements 311 and 312 are arbitrarily labeled "D1" and "DP", respectively.<br>
OFDM symbol processing block 230 receives incoming ODFM symbols and forwards<br>
P+l copies of each OFDM symbol to the P+l transmit antennas. Each OFDM symbol<br><br>
comprises N+G samples, where N is the number of samples in the original data<br>
symbol and G is the number of samples in the cyclic prefix appended to the original<br>
symbol.<br>
A first copy of each OFDM symbol is applied directly to the input of amplifier<br>
321, amplified by a gain value, gO, and sent to antenna 331. A second copy of each<br>
OFDM symbol is delayed by delay element 311, applied to the input of amplifier 322,<br>
amplified by a gain value, gl, and sent to antenna 332. Other copies of each OFDM<br>
symbol are similarly delayed and amplified according to the number of antennas. By<br>
way of example, the P+1 copy of each OFDM symbol is delayed by delay element<br>
312, applied to the input of amplifier 323, amplified by a gain value, gP, and sent to<br>
antenna 333. The gain values and the delay values are determined by the values in an<br>
OFDM symbol processing parameter set, as described hereafter and in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 11/327,799. The result is that multiple copies of each OFDM<br>
are transmitted, wherein each copy of an OFDM symbol is amplified by a selected<br>
amount and delayed by a selected amount relative to other OFDM symbol copies.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/327,799, incorporated by reference above,<br>
describes a number of architectures for OFDM symbol processing block 230 that<br>
achieve such a result. In an advantageous embodiment, the delays introduced by<br>
OFDM symbol processing block 230 are cyclic delays, as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 11/327,799.<br>
FIGURE 4A illustrates data traffic transmitted in the downlink from base<br>
station 102 to subscriber station 116 according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present disclosure. An exemplary frame of OFDM data is 10 milliseconds in length<br>
and comprises fifteen (15) transmit time intervals (TTIs), namely TTI 1 through TTI<br>
15, where each one of TTI 1 through TTI 15 is 0.667 milliseconds in duration. Within<br>
each of TTI 2 through TTI 15, there are four OFDM data symbols, where each OFDM<br>
data symbol is 0.1667 milliseconds in duration. In the first TTI, namely TTI 1, there<br>
are three OFDM data symbols that are preceded by a pilot preamble symbol. The pilot<br>
preamble symbol is used by SS 116 to perform synchronization channel estimation<br>
and to determine the OFDM symbol processing parameter set.<br>
FIGURE 4B is a flow diagram illustrating the determination of the user<br>
channel type based on the measurements on the preamble according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the disclosure. In an OFDM system, a known pilot sequence is<br>
transmitted for one or more OFDM symbol durations. Channel estimation block 285<br>
in the receiver (i.e., SS 116) detects the known pilot signal, which is then use to<br><br>
perform synchronization (process step 410). Channel estimation block 285 uses the<br>
detected preamble symbols to determine the degree of multipath effects in the channel<br>
and, therefore, the frequency selectivity in the channel between BS 102 and SS 116<br>
(process step 420).<br>
Based on the profile of the channel, channel estimation block 285 (or another<br>
processing element or controller in SS 116) determines (i.e., calculates) a set of<br>
OFDM symbol processing parameters (i.e., gain values and delay values) that may be<br>
used in BS 102 to improve reception of OFDM symbols in SS 116 (process step 430).<br>
SS 116 then feeds back the OFDM symbol processing parameter set to BS 102 in the<br>
uplink (process step 440). Other factors, such as mobile speed, can also be used in<br>
determining (or calculating) the OFDM symbol processing parameters. The channel<br>
type may also be determined by using other mechanisms, such as reference in<br>
time-frequency.<br>
In this manner, BS 102 receives an OFDM symbol processing parameter set<br>
from each subscriber station. Thereafter, as BS 102 schedules each subscriber station<br>
to receive data, BS 102 uses the OFDM symbol processing parameter set for that<br>
subscriber station to modify the OFDM symbols transmitted from each antenna for BS<br>
102. For example, BS 102 may use OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter Set A to<br>
transmit OFDM symbols from two or more antennas to SS 116 and may use OFDM<br>
Symbol Processing Parameter Set B to simultaneously transmit OFDM symbols from<br>
two or more antennas to SS 115.<br>
FIGURE 5 is a message flow diagram illustrating the transmission of OFDM<br>
symbols from base station 102 to subscriber station 116 according to one embodiment<br>
of the disclosure. In this example, base station 102 uses two transmit antennas (first<br>
antenna ANT1 and second antenna ANT 2) to transmit to SS 116. SSI 16 receives a<br>
first pilot signal (Pilot 1) from antenna ANT1 and receives a second pilot signal<br>
(Pilot2) from antenna ANT 2. SS A then determines OFDM Symbol Processing<br>
Parameter Set A as described above in FIGURES 4A and 4B.<br>
Next, SS 116 transmits OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter Set A to BS 102<br>
in signal 505. Thereafter, BS 102 uses OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter Set A to<br>
transmit OFDM data symbols in the downlink back to SS 116. As noted above, the<br>
OFDM symbol processing parameters in Parameter Set A consist of symbol delays<br>
and gains from the two antennas. By way of example, in signal 520, BS 102 transmits<br>
from ANT1 processed OFDM symbols that were processed using Parameter Set A. In<br>
signal 525, BS 102 simultaneously transmits from ANT2 processed OFDM symbols<br><br>
that were processed using Parameter Set A.<br>
BS 102 also simultaneously transmits pilot signal 510 (Pilotl) and pilot signal<br>
515 (Pilot2) from the two transmit antennas, ANT 1 and ANT 2. In the embodiment<br>
in FIGURE 5, Pilotl and Pilot2 are not processed using the parameters in OFDM<br>
Symbol Processing Parameter Set A. This is due to the fact that another transmission<br>
may be scheduled at the same time for another subscriber station on other OFDM<br>
subcarriers using a different set of OFDM symbol processing parameters. The pilot<br>
signals must be correctly understood by all the subscriber stations scheduled in the<br>
cell, so the pilot signals are not modified using OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter<br>
Set A.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a flow diagram illustrating the processing of pilot signals and<br>
OFDM data symbols according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure. Because the OFDM symbols in signals 520 and 525 are processed using<br>
the values in OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter Set A, signals 520 and 525 are<br>
combined during transmission over the radio link in such a way that single OFDM<br>
symbols are received in SS 116 from BS 102 (process step 650). Since pilot signals<br>
510 and 515 (Pilotl and Pilot2) are transmitted on orthogonal subcarriers from<br>
antenna ANT1 and antenna ANT2, pilot signals 510 and 515 are received separately<br>
at SS 116 (process steps 605 and 610).<br>
In order to get correct channel estimation for demodulation, SS 116<br>
compensates pilot signals 510 and 515 (Pilotl and Pilot2) from antennas ATN1 and<br>
ANT2 using the Parameter Set A received from channel estimation block 285 (process<br>
steps 615 and 620). Compensated pilot signals 510 and 515 are then combined<br>
(process step 630) and the overall channel estimate is obtained (process step 640).<br>
This overall channel estimate is then used by demodulator 280 to demodulate the<br>
processed data symbols carried in the OFDM subcarriers (process step 660).<br>
FIGURE 7 is a message flow diagram illustrating the transmission of OFDM<br>
symbols from base station 102 to subscriber station 116 according to another<br>
embodiment of the disclosure. In FIGURE 7, the OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters are determined in base station (BS) 102, rather than in subscriber station<br>
(SS) 116. BS 102 may determine (or estimate) the OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters in Parameter Set A from a number of different uplink signals 705<br>
transmitted by SS 116, including pilot signals 705, preamble signals 705 and/or data<br>
signals 705 from SS 116.<br>
In this example, since Pilotl signal 710 and Pilot2 signal 715 are not processed<br><br>
using Parameter Set A, BS 102 transmits OFDM Symbol Processing Parameter Set A<br>
to SS 116 in control message 720. SS 116 then uses the OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters as described in FIGURES 2-6. BS 102 transmits processed OFDM<br>
symbols 725 from ANT1 and processed symbols 730 from ANT2 using the gain and<br>
delay values in Parameter Set A. SS 116 uses the same gain and delay parameters in<br>
control message 720 to compensate the pilots and to perform the overall channel<br>
estimation for data demodulation.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a message flow diagram illustrating the transmission of OFDM<br>
symbols from base station 102 to subscriber station 116 according to another<br>
embodiment of the disclosure. Similar to FIGURE 7, the OFDM symbol processing<br>
parameters in FIGURE 8 are again determined in base station (BS) 102 for the case of<br>
two transmit antennas, rather than in subscriber station (SS) 116. BS 102 may<br>
determine (or estimate) the OFDM symbol processing parameters in Parameter Set A<br>
from a number of different uplink signals 805 transmitted by SS 116, including pilot<br>
signals 805, preamble signals 805 and/or data signals 805 from SS 116.<br>
However, unlike FIGURE 7, Pilotl signal 810 from ANT1 and Pilot2 signal<br>
815 from ANT2 are processed using Parameter Set A. In this case, the Pilotl signal<br>
and the Pilot2 signal both use the same OFDM subcarriers. In other words, the two<br>
pilots are not transmitted on orthogonal subcarriers. Therefore, the Pilotl signal and<br>
the Pilot2 signal are received in SS 116 as a single signal that can be directly used for<br>
overall channel estimation. The channel estimates are then used for data<br>
demodulation. BS 102 also transmits processed OFDM symbols 825 from ANT1 and<br>
processed symbols 830 from ANT2 using the gain and delay values in Parameter Set<br>
A.<br>
In a scenario where the Pilotl signal and the Pilot2 signal are not compensated,<br>
the channel quality estimate is based on the pilot signal strengths SS 116 receives from<br>
the two transmit antennas, ANT1 and ANT2. SS 116 compensates the Pilotl signal<br>
and the Pilot2 signal using the OFDM symbol processing parameters. This gives an<br>
estimate of the expected channel quality when BS 102 transmits OFDM symbols using<br>
the OFDM symbol processing parameters for SS 116. SS 116 then transmits a channel<br>
quality estimate (CQE) message back to BS 102. BS 102 determines an optimum data<br>
rate based on the channel quality estimate (CQE) message from SS 116 and then<br>
transmits processed OFDM symbols at that data rate.<br>
In SS 116, processed OFDM symbols containing data are processed using gain<br>
gO from ANT1, gain gl from ANT2 and delay Dl from ANT 2. These operations<br><br>
reverse the operations in OFDM symbol processing block 230 in FIGURE 3, assuming<br>
only transmit antenna 331 (i.e., ANT1) and transmits antenna 332 (i.e., ANT2) are<br>
used. In SS 116, an FFT operation is performed on the received OFDM symbols in<br>
order to retrieve the information in the frequency domain. The data and pilot symbols<br>
carried on orthogonal subcarriers are separated in the frequency domain. The pilot<br>
signals are converted back to the time domain by performing an IFFT operation. In<br>
this process, the subcarriers carrying data are set to 0. Also, when an ANT1 OFDM<br>
symbol is generated, the subcarriers carrying ANT2 OFDM symbols are set to 0.<br>
Similarly, when an ANT2 OFDM symbol is generated, the subcarriers carrying the<br>
ANT1 OFDM symbols are set to 0.<br>
SS 116 multiplies the pilot OFDM symbols from ANT1 with gain gO and the<br>
pilot OFDM symbols from ANT2 with gain gl. The receiver also delays the pilots<br>
from ANT2 with delay D1. Again, these operations reverse the operations in OFDM<br>
symbol processing block 230 in FIGURE 3, assuming only transmit antenna 331 (i.e.,<br>
ANT1) and transmits antenna 332 (i.e., ANT2) are used. The two resulting pilots are<br>
then combined to get the overall pilot. An FFT operation is performed on the overall<br>
pilot to get the overall channel response in the frequency domain. The channel<br>
estimate in the frequency domain is then used for data demodulation in the frequency<br>
domain. This additional compensation on the pilot signals allows for estimation of the<br>
additional processing done in BS 102 on the OFDM symbols containing data. The<br>
effect of the actual radio channel is also reflected in the overall channel estimate<br>
because the received pilot signals travel via the radio channel.<br>
The compensation needs to be done on the pilot symbols only, and not the data<br>
symbols, because the data symbols are already processed in BS 102. In an OFDM<br>
system, the pilot and data symbols are carried on OFDM subcarriers. Therefore, the<br>
compensation can either be done on the time domain OFDM symbol or directly in the<br>
frequency domain. In order to do compensation in the frequency domain, the affect of<br>
OFDM symbol delay in the time-domain must be accounted for in the frequency<br>
domain. In general, a time delay in the time domain translates into a phase rotation in<br>
the frequency domain. Therefore, the OFDM subcarriers carrying the pilot symbols<br>
may be appropriately phase rotated in the frequency domain to account for time<br>
delays.<br>
