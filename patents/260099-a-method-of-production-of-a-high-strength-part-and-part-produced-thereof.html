				<td>high-strength part that excels in hydrogen embrittlement resistance and strength after high-temperature forming; and a process for producing the same. The atmosphere in a heating furnace before forming is regulated to one of 10% hydrogen volume fraction and 30Â°C dew point. As a result the amount of hydrogen penetrating in a steel sheet during heating is reduced. After forming there are sequentially carried out quench hardening in die assembly and post-working. As the method of post-working there can be mentioned shearing followed by re-shearing or compression forming of sheared edge portion; punching with a cutting blade having a gradient portion at which the width of blade base is continuously reduced; punching with a punching tool having a curved blade with a protrudent configuration at the tip of cutting blade part the curved blade having a shoulder portion of given curvature radius and/or given angle; fusion cutting; etc. Consequently the tensile residual stress after punching is reduced and the performance of hydrogen embrittlement resistance is improved.</td>

HUGH STRENGTH PART AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION OF THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a member in which<br>
strength is required such as used for a structural member<br>
and reinforcing member of an automobile more<br>
particularly relates to a part superior in strength after<br>
high temperature shaping and a method of production of<br>
the same<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
To lighten the weight of automobiles a need<br>
originating in global environmental problems it is<br>
necessary to make the steel used in automobiles as high<br>
in strength as possible but in general if making steel<br>
sheet high in strength the elongation or r value falls<br>
and the shapeability deteriorates To solve this problem<br>
technology for hot shaping steel and utilizing the heat<br>
at that time to raise the strength is disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 2000-234153 This<br>
technology aims to suitably control the steel<br>
composition heat the steel in the ferrite temperature<br>
region and utilize the precipitation hardening in that<br>
temperature region so as to raise the strength<br>
Further Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 2000-<br>
87183 proposes high strength steel sheet greatly reduced<br>
in yield strength at the shaping temperature to much<br>
lower than the yield strength at ordinary temperature for<br>
the purpose of improving the precision of press-forming<br>
However in these technologies there may be limits to<br>
the strength obtained On the other hand technology for<br>
heating to the high temperature single-phase austenite<br>
region after shaping and in the subsequent cooling<br>
process transforming the steel to a hard phase for the<br>
purpose of obtaining high strength is proposed in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 2000-38640<br>
However if heating and rapidly cooling after<br>
shaping problems may arise in the shape precision As<br>
technology for overcoming this defect technology for<br>
heating steel sheet to the single-phase austenite region<br>
and in the subsequent press-forming process cooling the<br>
steel is disclosed in SAE 2001-01-0078 and Japanese<br>
Patent -Publication (A) No 2001-181833<br>
In this way in high strength steel sheet used for<br>
automobiles etc the higher the strength made the<br>
greater the above-mentioned problem of shapeability In<br>
particular in a high strength member of over 1000 MPa<br>
as known in the past there is the basic problem of<br>
hydrogen embrittlement (also called season cracking or<br>
delayed fracture) When used as hot press steel sheet<br>
while there is little residual stress due to the high<br>
temperature pressing hydrogen enters the steel at the<br>
time of heating before pressing Further the residual<br>
stress of the subsequent working causes greater<br>
susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement Therefore with<br>
just pressing at a high temperature the inherent problem<br>
is not solved It is necessary to optimize the process<br>
conditions in the heating process and the integrated<br>
processes to the post-processing<br>
To reduce the residual stress at the shearing and<br>
the other post-processing it is sufficient that the<br>
strength at the parts to be post-processed fall<br>
Technology lowering the cooling rate at portions to be<br>
post-processed so as to make the hardening insufficient<br>
and thereby lowering the strength at those portions is<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 2003-<br>
328031 According to this method it is considered that<br>
the strength of part of the part falls and enables easy<br>
shearing or other post-processing However when using<br>
this method the mold structure becomes complicated -<br>
which is disadvantangeous economically Further in this<br>
method hydrogen embrittlement is not alluded to at all<br>
By this method even if the steel sheet strength falls<br>
somewhat and the residual stress after the postprocessing<br>
falls to a certain extent if hydrogen remains<br>
in the steel hydrogen embrittlement may undeniably<br>
occur<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was made to solve this problem<br>
and provides a high strength part superior in resistance<br>
to hydrogen embrittlement able to give a strength of 1200<br>
MPa or more after high temperature shaping and method of<br>
production of the same<br>
The inventors conducted various studies to solve<br>
this problem As a result they discovered that to<br>
suppress hydrogen embrittlement it is effective to<br>
control the atmosphere in the heating furnace before<br>
shaping so as to reduce the amount of hydrogen in the<br>
steel and then reduce or eliminate the residual stress by<br>

BEST MODE FOR WORKING THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a high strength part<br>
superior in resistance to hydrogen embrittlement by<br>
controlling the atmosphere in the heating furnace when<br>
heating steel sheet before shaping to obtain a high<br>
strength part so as to reduce the amount of hydrogen in<br>
11<br>
the steel and by reducing the residual stress by the<br>
post-processing method and a method of production of the<br>
same<br>
Below the present invention will be explained in<br>
more detail First the reasons for limitation of the<br>
conditions in the present invention will be explained<br>
The amount of hydrogen at the time of heating was<br>
made by volume percent 10% or less because when the<br>
amount of hydrogen is over the limit the amount of<br>
hydrogen entering the steel sheet during heating becomes<br>
great and the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement falls<br>
Further the dew point in the atmosphere was made 30Â°C or<br>
less because with a dew point greater than this the<br>
amount of hydrogen entering the steel sheet during<br>
heating becomes greater and the resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement falls<br>
The heating temperature of the steel sheet is made<br>
the Acs to the melting point so as to make the structure<br>
of the steel sheet austenite for hardening and<br>
strengthening after shaping Further if the heating<br>
temperature is higher than the melting point pressforming<br>
becomes impossible<br>
The heating temperature of the steel sheet is made<br>
the Acs to the melting point so as to make the structure<br>
of the steel sheet austenite for hardening and<br>
strengthening after shaping Further if the heating<br>
temperature is higher than the melting point pressforming<br>
becomes impossible<br>
The shaping starting temperature is made a<br>
temperature higher than the temperature where ferrite<br>
pearlite bainite and martensite transformation occurs<br>
because if shaped at a temperature lower than this the<br>
hardness after shaping is insufficient<br>
By heating steel sheet under the above conditions<br>

the steel and by reducing the residual stress by the<br>
post-processing method and a method of production of the<br>
same<br>
Below the present invention will be explained in<br>
more detail First the reasons for limitation of the<br>
conditions in the present invention will be explained<br>
The amount of hydrogen at the time of heating was<br>
made by volume percent 10% or less because when the<br>
amount of hydrogen is over the limit the amount of<br>
hydrogen entering the steel sheet during heating becomes<br>
great and the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement falls<br>
Further the dew point in the atmosphere was made 30Â°C or<br>
less because with a dew point greater than this the<br>
amount of hydrogen entering the steel sheet during<br>
heating becomes greater and the resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement falls<br>
The heating temperature of the steel sheet is made<br>
the Acs to the melting point so as to make the structure<br>
of the steel sheet austenite for hardening and<br>
strengthening after shaping Further if the heating<br>
temperature is higher than the melting point pressforming<br>
becomes impossible<br>
The heating temperature of the steel sheet is made<br>
the Acs to the melting point so as to make the structure<br>
of the steel sheet austenite for hardening and<br>
strengthening after shaping Further if the heating<br>
temperature is higher than the melting point pressforming<br>
becomes impossible<br>
The shaping starting temperature is made a<br>
temperature higher than the temperature where ferrite<br>
pearlite bainite and martensite transformation occurs<br>
because if shaped at a temperature lower than this the<br>
hardness after shaping is insufficient<br>
By heating steel sheet under the above conditions<br>
and using the press method to shape it cooling and<br>
hardening after shaping in the mold then post-processing<br>
it it is possible to produce a high strength part The<br>
12<br>
"hardening" is the method of strengthening steel by<br>
cooling by a cooling rate faster than the critical<br>
cooling rate determined by the composition so as to cause<br>
a martensite transformation<br>
Next a different method of working by the above<br>
post-processing will be explained<br>
The method of working of claim 2 will be explained<br>
The inventors investigated in detail the plastic<br>
worked layer and residual stress affected zone at the<br>
worked end face of the shearing such as the punch<br>
piercing and cutting and as a result learned that there<br>
is a plastic worked layer etc present over about 2000 jam<br>
from the worked end As shown in FIG 1 at the time of<br>
shearing the steel sheet is worked in a compressed<br>
state After working the compressed state is released<br>
so it is believed that residual stress of tension occurs<br>
Therefore as shown in FIG 2 in the plastic worked<br>
layer or other affected zone the partial rise in<br>
strength due to the plastic working or the resistance to<br>
the compression force due to the tensile residual stress<br>
due to the second working causes the amount of<br>
compression at the time of working to become smaller and<br>
the amount of deformation of the opening after cutting to<br>
become smaller so the residual stress can be reduced<br>
Therefore if working the part of over 2000 |4m of the<br>
worked end in range again there is no plastic worked<br>
layer or other affected zone so the part is worked while<br>
again receiving a large compression force When this is<br>
released after working the residual stress is not<br>
reduced and the cracking resistance is not improved so<br>
the upper limit was made 2000 ^m Further the lower<br>
limit was set to I (am since working while controlling<br>
this to a range of less than 1 nm is difficult The most<br>
preferable range of working is 200 to 1000 (Jin<br>
Further the residual stress at the cross-section of<br>
the worked part is measured by an X-ray residual stress<br>
13<br>
measurement apparatus according to the method described<br>
in "X-Ray Stress Measurement Method Standard (2002<br>
Edition)- Ferrous Metal Section" Japan Society of<br>
Materials Science March 2002 The details are as<br>
follows The parallel tilt method is used to measure 20-<br>
sin2v|/ using the reflection X-rays of the 211 plane of a<br>
body centered cubic lattice The 26 measurement range at<br>
this time is about 150 to 162Â° Cr-Ka was used as the Xray<br>
target the tube current and tube voltage were made<br>
30 kV/10 mA and the X-ray incidence slit was made 1 mm<br>
square The value obtained by multiplying the stress<br>
constant K with the inclination of the 20-sin2vy curve was<br>
made the residual stress At this time the stress<br>
constant K was made -3244 kgf/deg<br>
Under the above conditions in the case of a pierced<br>
hole cross-section X|/(mm)=20 25 30 35 40 45 is<br>
measured while in the case of a cut surface V|/(mm) =0 20<br>
25 30 35 40 45 is measured The measurement was<br>
conducted in a thickness direction of 0Â° and directions<br>
inclined by 23Â° and 45Â° from that for a total of three<br>
measurements The average value was used as the residual<br>
stress<br>
The method of shearing such as punching or cutting<br>
is not particularly limited It is possible to use any<br>
known method Regarding the working temperature the<br>
effect of the present invention is obtained from room<br>
temperature to 1000Â°C in range<br>
By the above post-processing the residual stress of<br>
the tension at the worked end face becomes 600 MPa or<br>
less so in general when assuming steel sheet of 980 MPa<br>
or more the residual stress becomes less than the yield<br>
stress and cracks no longer occur Further when the<br>
residual stress of compression basically stress does not<br>
act in a direction where cracks form in the steel sheet<br>
at the ends so cracks no longer occur For this reason<br>
14<br>
the residual stress of tension at the end face in<br>
shearing such as punching or cutting preferably is made<br>
600 MPa or less or the residual stress of compression<br>
Next the methods of working of claims 3 and 4 will<br>
be explained<br>
To suppress hydrogen embrittlement in addition to<br>
press working the parts where there is residual stress<br>
arising due to shearing it is effective to impart<br>
residual stress of compression The end faces which were<br>
sheared are press worked because the residual stress of<br>
tension believed to cause hydrogen embrittlement after<br>
shearing is high at sheared ends and if press working<br>
such locations the residual stress of tension falls and<br>
the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement is improved As<br>
the method for press working the sheared end faces any<br>
method may be used but industrially the method of using<br>
coining as shown in claim 5 is economically superior<br>
Next the methods of working shown in claims 5 and 6<br>
will be explained<br>
The sheared end faces are worked in the state with<br>
the steel sheet compressed when working them as shown in<br>
FIG 1 After working the compressed state is released<br>
so residual stress of tension is believed to arise<br>
Therefore the inventors discovered that by widening<br>
holes or pressing the front surfaces of the end faces at<br>
the entire cross-section of the plastic worked layer or<br>
other affected zone the partial rise in strength due to<br>
plastic working or the resistance to the compression<br>
force due to the residual stress of tension enables<br>
control so that the release displacement after complete<br>
cutting becomes the compression side ie a single-step<br>
working method That is if enlarging a hole or pressing<br>
over a part in a range over 2000 pm from the worked end<br>
the hole is widened and the end face is pressed at one<br>
time Since this is released after working the residual<br>
stress ends up at the compression side at the end face<br>
To be able to obtain this by a single working operation<br>
15<br>
using a die and punch the shape of the blade tip as<br>
shown in FIGS 3 4 is important FIG 3 has a step<br>
difference forming the blade tip while FIG 4 has a tip<br>
parallel part at the tip of the step difference<br>
When providing a step difference continuously<br>
decreasing from the radius of curvature or width of the<br>
blade base in the direction from the blade base to the<br>
blade tip if the reduction in the radius of curvature or<br>
width is less than 001 mm the situation ends up<br>
becoming no different from ordinary punching or cutting<br>
so a large tensile stress ends up remaining at the end<br>
face On the other hand if the amount of reduction of<br>
the radius of curvature or width is over 30 mm the de<br>
facto clearance becomes large so the burring of the<br>
worked end face ends up becoming larger<br>
Further if the height of the blade vertical wall<br>
(height of step difference) is less than 1/2 of the<br>
thickness of the worked steel sheet after punching once<br>
it is no longer possible to press the worked end face<br>
from the side face of the step difference so the<br>
situation becomes no different from ordinary punching or<br>
cutting and a large tensile stress ends up remaining at<br>
the worked end face On the other hand if the height is<br>
over 100 mm the stroke becomes larger or shorter<br>
lifetime of the blade itself is a concern<br>
Further the angle formed by the parallel part of<br>
the cutting blade and the step difference (blade vertical<br>
wall angle 0) is preferably 95Â° to 179Â° more preferably<br>
at least 140Â°<br>
In FIG 3 and FIG 4 the step difference is shaped<br>
having a radius of curvature but a blade linearly<br>
reduced in width from the blade base is also included in<br>
the scope of the invention<br>
Further regarding the shape of the cutting blade<br>
D/H is important when the difference of the radius of<br>
curvature or width of the blade base and blade tip is D<br>
(mm) and the height of the step difference is H (mm) If<br>
16<br>
the value is less than 05 the drop in blade life or<br>
burring is suppressed so the value is preferably made<br>
05 or less<br>
On the other hand chamfering of the blade tip such<br>
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 5-<br>
23755 and Japanese Patent Publication (A) No 8-57557 is<br>
effective for reducing burring prolonging blade life<br>
and preventing cracking of relatively low strength steel<br>
sheet but in the present invention it is most important<br>
that the steel sheet be shaped under predetermined<br>
conditions then the once punched end face or cut end<br>
face be again pushed apart so it is not particularly<br>
necessary to chamber the blade tip in order to reduce the<br>
residual stress or make it the compression side<br>
Further the residual stress at the worked end face<br>
is measured under the above-mentioned conditions by an Xray<br>
residual stress measurement apparatus according to<br>
the method described in "X-Ray Stress Measurement Method<br>
Standards (2002 edition)- Ferrous Metal Section" Japan<br>
Society of Materials Science March 2002<br>
The method of shearing such as punching or cutting<br>
is not particularly limited Any known method may be<br>
used For the working temperature the effect of the<br>
present invention is obtained in the range of room<br>
temperature to 1000Â°C<br>
Further regarding the residual stress if zero or<br>
the compression side basically no reaction acts at the<br>
end in the direction where the steel sheet will crack so<br>
cracks no longer occur Further pressing at not more<br>
than 600 MPa is effective for preventing cracks<br>
Next the methods of working of claims 7 8 and 9<br>
will be explained<br>
The inventors considered the above problems and<br>
discovered that by making the punch shape a two-step<br>
structure of the bending blade A and cutting blade B<br>
shown in FIG 6 it is possible to reduce the residual<br>
stress at the punched end face<br>
17<br>
The reasons are considered to be as follows<br>
In ordinary punching the part deformed by the punch<br>
and die shown in FIG 5 (hardened layer) is subjected to<br>
a large tensile or compressive strain For this reason<br>
the work hardening of that part becomes remarkable so<br>
the ductility of the end face deteriorates However when<br>
making the punch shape the two-step structure comprised<br>
of the cutting blade B and bending blade A such as shown<br>
in the present invention (FIG 6) as shown in FIG 7<br>
when the part cut by the cutting blade B (material cut<br>
part M) is given tensile stress by the bending blade A<br>
the progression of cracks arising due to the cutting<br>
blade B and die shoulder is promoted by the tensile<br>
stress and the material is cut by the cutting blade B<br>
without compression so the residual stress of tension<br>
after punching becomes lower and the drop in the<br>
allowable amount of hydrogen entering from the<br>
environment can be suppressed<br>
Further the inventors conducted detailed studies on<br>
the shape of the bending blade and discovered that unless<br>
making the shape of the bending blade a predetermined<br>
shape a sufficient effect of reduction of the residual<br>
stress cannot be obtained<br>
That is when the shape of the bending blade A is<br>
not the predetermined shape the material is cut by the<br>
bending blade A so the part M cut by the cutting blade B<br>
cannot be given sufficient tensile stress by the bending<br>
However by making the shape of the bending blade a shape<br>
where the material is not cut by the bending blade<br>
itself the residual stress can be reduced<br>
FIG 8 shows the relationship between the radius of<br>
curvature Rp and the residual stress in the case of using<br>
TS1470 MPa grade hardened steel sheet of a thickness of<br>
20 mm under conditions of a height Hp of the bending<br>
blade 03 mm a clearance of 5% a vertical wall angle 0p<br>
of the bending blade of 90Â° and a predetermined radius of<br>
curvature Rp given to the shoulder of the bending blade<br>
18<br>
A If the radius of curvature is 02 mm or more it is<br>
learned that the residual stress is reduced Here the<br>
residual stress is found by measuring the change in<br>
lattice distance by the X-ray diffraction method at the<br>
cut surface The measurement area is made a 1 mm square<br>
region and the measurement conducted at the center of<br>
thickness at the cut surface When using a punch to make<br>
holes it is not possible to fire X-rays from a direction<br>
vertical to the cutting surface so the angle of emission<br>
of the X-rays is changed for measurement so as to enable<br>
measurement of the residual stress in the thickness<br>
direction Further in this case the clearance is the<br>
punch and die clearance C/thickness t x 100 (%) The<br>
other punching conditions are a punch diameter Ap = 20 mm<br>
and a distance Dp = 10 mm between the cutting blade end<br>
P and the bending blade rising position D<br>
Further FIG 9 shows the relationship between the<br>
angle 6p and the residual stress in the case of using<br>
TS1470 MPa grade hardened steel sheet of a thickness of<br>
18 mm under conditions of a height Hp of the bending<br>
blade of 03 mm a clearance of 56% a radius of<br>
curvature of the bending blade shoulder of 02 mm and a<br>
vertical wall part of the bending blade A of a<br>
predetermined angle 0p Due to this it is learned that by<br>
making the angle 0p of the vertical wall of the bending<br>
blade 100Â° to 170Â° the residual stress is reduced The<br>
other punching conditions are a punch diameter Ap = 20 mm<br>
and a distance Dp = 10 mm between the cutting blade end<br>
P and the bending blade rising position D<br>
FIG 10 shows the relationship between the height Hp<br>
of the bending blade and the residual stress in the case<br>
of using TS1470 MPa grade hardened steel sheet of a<br>
thickness of 14 mm under conditions of a radius of<br>
curvature Rp of the shoulder of the bending blade A of<br>
03 mm an angle 6p of the vertical wall of the bending<br>
blade A of 135Â° a clearance of 71 and a height Hp of<br>
19<br>
the bending blade of 03 to 3 mm Due to this it is<br>
learned that by making the radius of curvature Rp of the<br>
shoulder of the bending blade 02 mm or more or making<br>
the angle 6p of the vertical wall of the bending blade<br>
100Â° to 170Â° the residual stress is reduced compared with<br>
the ordinary case of no bending blade that is Hp = 0<br>
The rest of the punching conditions are a punch diameter<br>
of Ap = 20 mm and a distance Dp = 10 mm of the cutting<br>
blade end P and bending blade rising position D<br>
Further FIG 11 shows the effect of punching<br>
clearance on the residual stress when using TS1470 MPa<br>
grade hardened steel sheet of a thickness of 16 mm under<br>
conditions of a radius of curvature Rp of the shoulder of<br>
the bending blade A of 03 mm an angle 6p of the vertical<br>
wall of the bending blade A of 135Â° and a height Hp of<br>
the bending blade of 03 mm The rest of the punching<br>
conditions are a punch diameter of Ap = 20 mm and a<br>
distance Dp = 10 mm of the cutting blade end P and the<br>
bending blade rising position D The clearance also has<br>
an effect on the residual stress If the clearance<br>
becomes a large one over 25% the residual stress also<br>
becomes larger This is believed to be due to the tensile<br>
effect by the bending blade becoming smaller so the<br>
clearance has to be made 25% or less<br>
The present invention was made based on this study<br>
and has the following requirements<br>
The punching punch or die used in the present<br>
invention has to be made a two-step structure of the<br>
bending blade A and cutting blade B This is so that<br>
before the cutting blade B shears the worked material<br>
the bending blade A gives tensile stress to the cut part<br>
M of the worked material and reduces the residual stress<br>
of the tension remaining at the cut end surface of the<br>
worked material after cutting<br>
The radius of curvature Rp of the bending shoulder<br>
has to be at least 02 mm This is because if the radius<br>
20<br>
of curvature Rp of the shoulder of the bending blade is<br>
not more than 02 mm it is not possible for the worked<br>
material to be sheared by the bending blade A and for the<br>
part M sheared by the cutting blade B to be given<br>
sufficient tensile stress<br>
The angle 0p of the shoulder of the bending blade has<br>
to be made 100Â° to 170Â° This is because if the angle 9p<br>
of the shoulder of the bending blade is 100Â° or less the<br>
material is sheared by the bending blade A so a<br>
sufficient tensile stress cannot be given to the part M<br>
sheared by the cutting blade B Further if the angle 0p<br>
of the shoulder of the bending blade is 170Â° or more<br>
sufficient tensile stress cannot be given to the part to<br>
be sheared by the cutting blade B<br>
If either of the above conditions relating to the<br>
radius of curvature Rp of the shoulder of the bending<br>
blade and the angle 6p of the shoulder of the bending<br>
blade is met a large effect is obtained but when both<br>
are met the contact pressure of the material contacting<br>
the alloy mold is reduced so the mold wear is<br>
suppressed Therefore for maintenance having both<br>
conditions met is preferred<br>
Further in ordinary punching usually a sheet<br>
holder is used for fastening the material to the die but<br>
it is also possible to suitably use a sheet holder in the<br>
method of punching of the present invention The wrinkle<br>
suppressing load (load applied to material from sheet<br>
holder) does not have a particularly large effect on the<br>
residual stress so may be used in the usually used<br>
range<br>
The punch speed does not have a great effect on the<br>
residual stress even if the changed within the usual<br>
industrially used range for example 001 m/sec to<br>
several m/sec so may be made any value<br>
Further in most cases in the punching process to<br>
21<br>
suppress mold wear the mold or material is coated with<br>
lubrication oil In the present invention as well a<br>
suitable lubrication oil may be used for this purpose<br>
Further to give sufficient tensile stress to the<br>
bending blade A the height Hp of the bending blade is<br>
preferably made at least 10% of the thickness of the<br>
worked material<br>
Further the distance Dp of the cutting blade end P<br>
and the rising position Q of the bending blade is<br>
preferably made at least 01 mm This is because if the<br>
distance is less than this when shearing the worked<br>
material by the cutting blade B the cracks which usually<br>
occur near the shoulder of the cutting blade become<br>
difficult to occur and strain is given to the cutting<br>
position by the cutting blade<br>
Further the part between the cutting blade end P<br>
and rising position Q of the bending blade in the punch<br>
of the present invention the bottom part of the bending<br>
blade A and the vertical wall part of the bending blade<br>
A are preferably flat shapes in terms of the production<br>
of the punch but even if there is some relief shape the<br>
effect is the same even if the above requirements are<br>
satisfied<br>
The present invention reduces the residual stress of<br>
the end face at the time of punching by further adding<br>
the bending blade A to the punch of conventionally only<br>
the cutting blade B By adding the bending blade A and<br>
further making the height Hp of the bending blade higher<br>
the facial pressure where the cutting blade B and worked<br>
material contact each other falls so the amount of wear<br>
of the cutting blade end P is also reduced but if the Hp<br>
is too high before the cutting blade B and worked<br>
material contact the material may break between the<br>
bending blade A and the cutting blade B and the effect<br>
may not be obtained In this case the height Hp of the<br>
bending blade is preferably made about 10 mm or less<br>
In the present invention there is no particular<br>
22<br>
upper limit to the radius of curvature Rp of the shoulder<br>
of the bending blade shoulder but depending on the size<br>
of the punch If the radius of curvature Rp is too large<br>
it becomes difficult to increase the height Hp of the<br>
bending blade so 5 mm or less is preferable<br>
Above the effect in the case of adding a bending<br>
blade to the punch was explained but both when adding<br>
bending blades to both of the punch and die and when<br>
adding a bending blade to only the die since a tensile<br>
stress is given to the material in the same way as when<br>
adding a bending blade to only the punch as explained<br>
above similar effects are obtained The limitations on<br>
the dimensions of the bending blade in this case are the<br>
same as the limitations in the case of adding a bending<br>
blade to only the punch as explained above<br>
Next the method of working of claim 10 will be<br>
explained<br>
As the method of reducing the residual stress it is<br>
necessary to hot shape the steel and then shear it near<br>
bottom dead center The reason is believed to be as<br>
follows In shearing during hot working it is believed<br>
that the shearing tool contacts the steel sheet with a<br>
high facial pressure In this case it is believed that<br>
the cooling rate becomes large and that the steel is<br>
transformed from austenite to a low temperature<br>
transformed structure with a high deformation resistance<br>
At this time it is believed that while smaller than the<br>
case of working hardened material at room temperature<br>
larger residual stress than the case of austenite may<br>
remain Therefore the plate is sheared near bottom dead<br>
center because if during hot shaping the deformation<br>
resistance of the steel sheet is small and the residual<br>
stress after working becomes low Further the reason for<br>
the timing of working being near bottom dead center is<br>
that if not near bottom dead center after shearing the<br>
steel sheet will deform and the shape and positional<br>
precision will drop "Near bottom dead point" means<br>
around the part any method may be used but<br>
industrially drilling or cutting by a saw is good since<br>
it is economically superior<br>
The method of working of claim 15 will be explained<br>
Even in the case of using the prior working for the<br>
post-processing it is sufficient to mechanically cut the<br>
location with the high residual stress at the end face of<br>
the sheared part The cut surface of the sheared part is<br>
removed to a thickness of 005 mm or more because with<br>
removal of thickness less than this the location where<br>
residual stress remains cannot be sufficiently removed<br>
and the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement falls<br>
As the method for removing a thickness of 005 mm or<br>
more from the cut surface of the sheared part by<br>
mechanical cutting any method may be used Industrially<br>
a mechanical cutting method such as reaming is good since<br>
it is economically superior<br>
Below the reasons for limiting the chemical<br>
composition of the steel sheet forming the material will<br>
be explained<br>
C is an element added for making the structure after<br>
cooling martensite and securing the material properties<br>
To secure a strength of 1000 MPa or more it is desirably<br>
added in an amount of 005% or more However if the<br>
amount added is too large it is difficult to secure the<br>
strength at the time of impact deformation so the upper<br>
limit is desirably 055%<br>
Mn is an element for improving the strength and<br>
hardenability If less than 01% sufficient strength is<br>
not obtained at the time of hardening Further even if<br>
added over 3% the effect becomes saturated Therefore<br>
Mn is preferably 01 to 3% in range<br>
Si is a solution hardening type alloy element but<br>
if over 10% the surface scale becomes a problem<br>
Further when plating the surface of steel sheet if the<br>
amount of Si added is large the plateability<br>
deteriorates so the upper limit is preferably made 05%<br>
24<br>
within at least 10 mm preferably within 5 mm of bottom<br>
dead point<br>
Next the methods of working of claims 11 12 and<br>
13 will be explained<br>
To suppress the hydrogen embrittlement it is<br>
effective to control the atmosphere in the heating<br>
furnace before shaping to reduce the amount of hydrogen<br>
in the steel and then post-process it by fusion cutting<br>
with its little residual stress after working<br>
The reason for cooling and hardening the steel after<br>
shaping in the mold to produce a high strength part then<br>
melting part of the part to cut it is that if melting<br>
part of the part to cut it the residual stress after<br>
working is small and the resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement is good<br>
As the method of working to melt part of the part to<br>
cut it any method may be used but industrially laser<br>
working and plasma cutting with small heat affected zones<br>
such as shown in claims 12 13 are preferable Gas<br>
cutting has small residual stress after working but is<br>
disadvantageous in that it requires a large input heat<br>
and has greater parts where the strength of the part<br>
falls<br>
Next the method of working of claim 14 will be<br>
explained<br>
To suppress hydrogen embrittlement it is effective<br>
to control the atmosphere in the heating furnace before<br>
shaping so as to reduce the amount of hydrogen in the<br>
steel and to post-process the steel by machining with a<br>
small residual stress after working<br>
The reason for cooling and hardening the steel after<br>
shaping in the mold to produce a high strength part then<br>
machining it to perforate it or cut around the part is<br>
that with cutting or other machining the residual stress<br>
after working is small and the resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement is good<br>
As the method for machining to perforate it or cut<br>
Al is a required element used as a material for<br>
deoxidizing molten steel and further is an element fixing<br>
N Its amount has an effect on the crystal grain size or<br>
mechanical properties To have such an effect a content<br>
of 0005% or more is required but if over 01% there<br>
are large nonmetallic inclusions and surface flaws easily<br>
occur at the product For this reason Al is preferably<br>
0005 to 01% in range<br>
S has an effect on the nonmetallic inclusions in the<br>
steel It causes deterioration of the workability and<br>
becomes a cause of deterioration of the toughness and<br>
increase of the anisotropy and susceptibility to repeat<br>
heat cracking For this reason S is preferably 002% or<br>
less Note that more preferably it is 001% or less<br>
Further by limiting the S to 0005% or less the impact<br>
characteristics are strikingly improved<br>
P is an element having a detrimental effect on the<br>
weld cracking and toughness so P is preferably 003% or<br>
less Note that preferably it is 002% or less Further<br>
more preferably it is 0015% or less<br>
If N exceeds 001% the coarsening of the nitrides<br>
and the age hardening by the solute N causes the<br>
toughness to deteriorate as a trend For this reason N<br>
is preferably contained in an amount of 001% or less<br>
0 is not particularly limited but excessive<br>
addition becomes a cause of formation of oxides having a<br>
detrimental effect on the toughness To suppress oxides<br>
becoming the starting point of fatigue fracture<br>
preferably the content is 0015% or less<br>
Cr is an element for improving the hardenability<br>
Further it has the effect of causing the precipitation<br>
of M23C6 type carbides in the matrix It has the action of<br>
raising the strength and making the carbides finer It is<br>
added to obtain these effects If less than 001% these<br>
effects cannot be sufficiently expected Further if over<br>
12% the yield strength tends to excessively rise so Cr<br>
is preferably 001 to 10% in range More preferably it<br>
is 005 to 1%<br>
B may be added for the purpose of improving the<br>
hardenability during the press-forming or in the cooling<br>
after press-forming To achieve this effect addition of<br>
00002% or more is necessary However if this amount of<br>
addition is increased too much there is a concern of hot<br>
cracking and the effect is saturated so the upper limit<br>
is desirably made 00050%<br>
Ti may be added for the purpose of fastening the N<br>
forming a compound with B for effectively bringing out<br>
the effect of B To bring out this effect (Ti - 342 x<br>
N) has to be at least 0001% but if overly increasing<br>
the amount of Ti the amount of C not bonding with Ti<br>
decreases and after cooling a sufficient strength can no<br>
longer be obtained As the upper limit the Ti equivalent<br>
enabling an amount of C not bound with Ti of at least<br>
01% that is {399 x (C-005) + (342 x N + 0001)}%<br>
is preferable<br>
Ni Cu Sn and other elements probably entering<br>
from the scrap may also be included Further from the<br>
viewpoint of control of the shape of the inclusions Ca<br>
Mg Y As Sb and REM may also be added Further to<br>
improve the strength it is also possible to add Ti Nb<br>
Zr Mo or V In particular Mo improves the<br>
hardenability as well so may also be added for this<br>
purpose but if these elements are overly increased the<br>
amount of C not bonding with these elements will decrease<br>
and a sufficient strength will no longer be obtained<br>
after cooling so addition of not more than 1% or each is<br>
preferable<br>
The above Cr B Ti and Mo are elements having an<br>
effect on the hardenability The amounts of these<br>
elements added may be optimized considering the required<br>
hardenability the cost at the time of production etc<br>
For example it is possible to optimize the above<br>
elements Mn etc to reduce the alloy cost reduce the<br>
number of steel types to reduce the cost even if the<br>
alloy cost does not become the minimum or use other<br>
various combinations of elements in accordance with the<br>
circumstances at the time of production<br>
In addition there is no particular problem even if<br>
inevitably included impurities are included<br>
The steel sheet of the above composition may also be<br>
treated by aluminum plating aluminum-zinc plating or<br>
zinc plating In the method of production of the same<br>
the pickling and cold rolling may be performed by<br>
ordinary methods There is also no problem even if the<br>
aluminum plating process or aluminum-zinc plating process<br>
and zinc plating are also performed by ordinary methods<br>
That is with aluminum plating an Si concentration in<br>
the bath of 5 to 12% is suitable while with aluminumzinc<br>
plating a Zn concentration in the bath of 40 to 50%<br>
is suitable Further there is no particular problem even<br>
if the aluminum plating layer includes Mg or Zn or the<br>
aluminum-zinc plating layer includes Mg It is possible<br>
to produce steel sheet of similar characteristics<br>
Note that regarding the atmosphere of the plating<br>
process plating is possible by ordinary conditions both<br>
in a continuous plating facility having a nonoxidizing<br>
furnace and in a not continuous plating facility having a<br>
nonoxidizing furnace Since with this steel sheet alone<br>
no special control is required the productivity is not<br>
inhibited either Further if the zinc plating method<br>
hot dip galvanization electrolytic zinc coating<br>
alloying hot dip galvanization or another method may be<br>
used Under the above production conditions the surface<br>
of the steel sheet is not pre-plated with metal before<br>
the plating but there is no particular problem<br>
preplating the steel sheet with nickel preplating it<br>
with iron or preplating it with another metal to improve<br>
the platability Further there is no particular problem<br>
even if treating the surface of the plated layer by<br>
plating by a different metal or coating it by an<br>
inorganic or organic compound Next examples will be<br>
used to explain the present invention in more detail<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Slabs of the chemical compositions shown in Table 1<br>
were cast These slabs were heated to 1050 to 1350Â°C and<br>
hot rolled at a finishing temperature of 800 to 900Â°C and<br>
a coiling temperature of 450 to 680Â°C to obtain hot rolled<br>
steel sheets of a thickness of 4 mm Next these were<br>
pickled then cold rolled to obtain cold rolled steel<br>
sheets of a thickness of 16 mm After this these were<br>
heated to the austenite region of 950Â°C above the Ac3<br>
point then were hot shaped The atmosphere of the<br>
heating furnace was changed in the amount of hydrogen and<br>
dew point The conditions are shown in Table 2 and Table<br>
3 The tensile strengths were 1523 MPa and 1751 MPa<br>
When evaluating the punch pieced parts 100 mm x 100<br>
mm size pieces were cut from these shaped parts to obtain<br>
test pieces The center parts were punched out by a O10<br>
mm punch at a clearance of 15% then the pieces were<br>
secondarily worked under various conditions Further<br>
when evaluating cut parts the secondarily worked test<br>
pieces were cut to sizes of 314 mm x 314 mm by primary<br>
working at a clearance of 15% then were secondarily<br>
worked under various conditions in the same way as punch<br>
piercing The shape of the test piece at this time is<br>
shown in FIGS 12 13 The range of working when<br>
performing this secondary working was also noted The<br>
mechanical grinding was performed by a reamer for the<br>
punch pierced hole and by a milling machine for the cut<br>
end To evaluate the resistance to cracks of these test<br>
pieces the test pieces were allowed to stand after<br>
secondary working for 24 hours at room temperature then<br>
the number of cracks at the worked ends and the residual<br>
stress at the punched ends and cut ends were measured by<br>
X-rays The number of cracks was measured for the entire<br>
circumference of the hole for a punch pierced hole For<br>
cut ends one side was measured<br>
As a result of the study under both the conditions<br>
of punch piercing and cutting cracking frequently<br>
occurred under the production condition nos 1 2 3 5<br>
6 7 8 and 10 where the amount of hydrogen of the<br>
heating atmosphere is 30% or the dew point is 50Â°C the<br>
primary working is left as it is or after the primary<br>
working secondary working is performed over 3 mm from<br>
the worked end while cracking did not occur under the<br>
secondary working production condition nos 4 and 9 where<br>
the amount of hydrogen of the heating atmosphere is 10%<br>
or less the dew point is 30Â°C or less and 1000 Jim from<br>
the worked end is secondarily worked after the primary<br>
working Further the trends in the number of cracks<br>
occurring under production conditions of an amount of<br>
hydrogen in the heating atmosphere of 10% or less and of<br>
a dew point of 30Â°C or less and the results of measurement<br>
of the residual stress by X rays match well Therefore<br>
for improvement of the crack resistance of worked ends<br>
it can be said to be effective to rework the part of 1 to<br>
2000 urn from the worked ends after primary working<br>

a coiling temperature of 450 to 680Â°C to obtain hot rolled<br>
steel sheets of a thickness of 4 mm Next these were<br>
pickled then cold rolled to obtain steel sheets of a<br>
thickness of 16 mm Further parts of the cold rolled<br>
plates were treated by hot dip aluminum coating hot dip<br>

and hot dip galvanization Table 5 shows the legend of<br>
the plating type After this these cold rolled steel<br>
sheets and surface treated steel sheets were heated by<br>
furnace heating to the austenite region of the Acs point<br>

x 500 As the shaping conditions the punch speed was<br>
made 10 mm/s the pressing force was made 200 tons and<br>
the holding time until the bottom dead point was made 5<br>
seconds A schematic view of the shaped part is shown in<br>
FIG 17 A tensile test piece was cut out from the shaped<br>
part The tensile strength of the shaped part was 1470<br>
MPa or more The shearing conducted was piercing The<br>

diameter of 10 mm(j and using a die of a diameter of 105<br>
mm FIG 18 shows the shape of the part as seen from<br>

30 minutes after the hot shaping After the piercing<br>
shaping was performed The working methods are also shown<br>
in Table 6 For the legend the case of shaping is shown<br>
by "S" while the case of no working is shown by "N" At<br>
this time the finished hole diameter was changed and the<br>
effect of the removed thickness was studied The<br>
conditions are shown together in Table 6 The shaping was<br>
performed within 30 minutes after the piercing The<br>
resistance to hydrogen embrittlement was evaluated by<br>
examining the entire circumference of the hole one week<br>
after the shaping so as to judge the presence of any<br>
cracks The examination was performed using a loupe or<br>
electron microscope The results of judgment are shown<br>
together in Table 6 Note that the press used was a<br>
general crank press<br>
Experiment Nos 1 to 249 show the results of<br>
consideration of the effects of the steel type plating<br>

dew point for the case of working by shaping If in the<br>
scope of the invention no cracks occurred after<br>
piercing Experiment Nos 250 to 277 are comparative<br>
cases of no working In all cases no cracks occurred<br>

legend in FIG 18 is shown here (1: part 2: center of<br>
pierce hole) The piercing was performed within 30<br>
minutes after hot shaping After the piercing coining<br>
was performed The coining was performed by sandwiching a<br>
plate to be worked between a conical punch having an<br>
angle of 45Â° with respect to the plate surface and a die<br>
having a flat surface FIG 19 shows the tool The legend<br>
in FIG 19 is shown here (I: punch 2: die 3: blank<br>
after piercing) The coining was performed within 30<br>
seconds after piercing The resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement was evaluated one week after coining by<br>
observing the entire circumference of the hole and<br>
judging the presence of cracks The cracks were observed<br>
by a loupe or electron microscope The results of<br>
judgment are shown together in Table 7<br>
Experiment Nos I to 249 show the results of<br>
consideration of the effects of the steel type plating<br>
type concentration of hydrogen in the atmosphere and<br>
dew point for the case of coining If in the scope of the<br>
invention no cracks occurred after piercing Experiment<br>
Nos 250 to 277 are comparative examples in the case of<br>
no coining Since these are outside of the scope of the<br>
 (Example 4)<br>
Slabs of the chemical compositions shown in Table 1<br>
were cast These slabs were heated to 1050 to 1350Â°C and<br>
hot rolled at a finishing temperature of 800 to 900Â°C and<br>
coiling temperature of 450 to 680Â°C to obtain hot rolled<br>
steel sheets of a thickness of 4 mm Next these were<br>
pickled then cold rolled to obtain cold rolled steel<br>
sheets of a thickness of 16 mm After this the sheets<br>
were heated to the Ac3 point to the 950Â°C austenite<br>
region then were hot shaped The atmosphere of the<br>
heating furnace was changed in the amount of hydrogen and<br>
the dew point The conditions are shown in Table 8 The<br>
tensile strengths were 1525 MPa and 1785 MPa<br>
When evaluating the punch pieced parts 100 mm x 100<br>
mm size pieces were cut from these shaped parts to obtain<br>
test pieces The centers were punched out in the shapes<br>
shown in FIGS 3 4 by a punch with a parallel part of<br>
O10 mm and 20 mm and a tip of 5 to 13 mm by a clearance<br>
of 43 to 25% To evaluate these test pieces for<br>
resistance to cracking the number of cracks at the<br>
secondarily worked ends were measured and the residual<br>
stress at the punched ends and cut ends was measured by<br>
X-rays The number of cracks were measured for the entire<br>
circumference of the punch pieced holes For the cut<br>
ends single sides were measured The working conditions<br>
and results are also shown in Table 8<br>
The result of the above study is that under both<br>
punch piercing and cutting conditions cracks frequently<br>
occurred at samples outside of the scope of the present<br>
invention while no cracks occurred at samples inside the<br>
scope of the present invention<br>
 (Note) Underlines indicate conditions outside range of invention<br>
(Example 5)<br>
Aluminum plated steel sheets of the compositions<br>
shown in Table 9 (thickness 16 mm) were held at 950Â°C for<br>
1 minute then hardened at 800Â°C by a sheet mold to<br>
prepare test samples The test samples had strengths of<br>
TS=1540 MPa YP=1120 MPa and T-E1=6% Holes were made in<br>
the steel sheets using molds of the types shown in FIG<br>
20A FIG 20B FIG 20C and FIG 20D under the<br>
conditions of Table 10 The punching clearance was<br>
adjusted to 5 to 40% in range The resistance to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement was evaluated by examining the entire<br>
circumference of the holes one week after working to<br>
judge for the presence of cracks The observation was<br>
performed using a loupe or electron microscope The<br>
results of judgment are shown together in Table 10<br>
Level 1 is the level serving as the reference for<br>
the residual stress resulting from punching by the<br>
present invention in a conventional punching test using<br>
an A type mold Cracks occurred due to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement<br>
In a test using a B type mold level 2 had a large<br>
angle 9p of the shoulder of the bending blade shoulder a<br>
small radius of curvature Rp of the shoulder of the<br>
bending blade a small effect of reduction of the<br>
residual stress and cracks due to hydrogen<br>
embrittlement Level 3 had a large clearance a small<br>
effect of reduction of the residual stress and cracks<br>
due to hydrogen embrittlement Level 4 had a small<br>
shoulder angle 0p of the bending blade and a small radius<br>
of curvature Rp of the shoulder of the bending blade For<br>
this reason the widening value obtained by this punching<br>
was not improved over the prior art method so cracks<br>
occurred due to hydrogen embrittlement<br>
In a test using a C type mold level 11 had a punch<br>
constituted by an ordinary punch and a shoulder angle 6d<br>
of the projection of the die and a radius of curvature Rd<br>
of the shoulder satisfying predetermined conditions so<br>
there was a small effect of reduction of the residual<br>
stress and cracks occurred due to hydrogen embrittlement<br>
Level 12 had a large clearance and a small effect of<br>
reduction of the residual stress so cracks occurred due<br>
to hydrogen embrittlement<br>
In a test using a D type mold level 18 did not meet<br>
the predetermined conditions in the angle 0p of the<br>
shoulder of the projection of the punch the radius of<br>
curvature Rp of the shoulder the angle 0d of the shoulder<br>
of the projection of the die and the radius of curvature<br>
Rd of the shoulder so no effect of reduction of the<br>
residual stress could be seen and no cracks occurred due<br>
to hydrogen embrittlement Further level 15 had a large<br>
clearance and a small effect of reduction of residual<br>
stress so cracks occurred due to hydrogen embrittlement<br>
Levels 8 9 14 15 21 22 have heating atmospheres<br>
over the limited range so cracks occurred due to<br>
hydrogen embrittlement<br>
The other levels satisfied the conditions of the<br>
present invention The residual stresses at the punched<br>
cross-sections were reduced and no cracks occurred due to<br>
hydrogen embrittlement<br>

Slabs of the chemical compositions shown in Table 4<br>
were cast These slabs were heated to 1050 to 1350Â°C and<br>
hot rolled at a finishing temperature of 800 to 900Â°C and<br>
a coiling temperature of 450 to 680Â°C to obtain hot rolled<br>
steel sheets of a thickness of 4 mm After this the<br>
steel sheets were pickled then cold rolled to obtain<br>
cold rolled steel sheets of a thickness of 16 mm<br>
Further part of these cold rolled steel sheets were<br>
treated by hot dip aluminum coating hot dip aluminumzinc<br>
coating alloying hot dip galvanization and hot dip<br>
galvanization Table 5 shows the legends of the plating<br>
types After this these cold rolled steel sheets and<br>
surface treated steel sheets were heated by furnace<br>
heating to above the Ac3 point that is the 950Â°C<br>
austenite region then were hot shaped The atmosphere of<br>
the heating furnace was changed in the amount of hydrogen<br>
and the dew point The conditions are shown in Table 11<br>

legend in FIG 23 is shown here (1: press-forming die 3:<br>
piercing punch) The mold followed the shape of the<br>
punch The shape of the die was determined by a clearance<br>
of a thickness of 16 mm The piercing was performed<br>
using a punch of a diameter of 20 mm and a die of a<br>
diameter of 205 mm The blank size was made 16 mm<br>
thickness x 300 x 500 The shaping conditions were made a<br>
punch speed of 10 mm/s a pressing force of 200 ton and<br>
a holding time at bottom dead center of 5 seconds A<br>
schematic view of the shaped part is shown in FIG 24<br>
From a tensile test piece cut out from the shaped part<br>
54<br>
the tensile strength of the shaped part was shown as<br>
being 1470 MPa or more<br>
The effect of the timing of the start of piercing<br>
was studied by changing the length of the piercing punch<br>
Table 11 shows the depth of shaping where the piercing is<br>
started by the distance from bottom dead center as the<br>
shearing timing To hold the shape after working this<br>
value is within 10 mm preferably within 5 mm<br>
The resistance to hydrogen embrittlement was<br>
evaluated by observing the entire circumference of the<br>
pieced holes one week after shaping to judge the presence<br>
of cracks The observation was performed using a loupe or<br>
electron microscope The results of judgment are shown<br>
together in Table 11 Further the precision of the hole<br>
shape was measured by a caliper and the difference from a<br>
reference shape was found A difference of not more than<br>
10 mm was considered good The results of judgment were<br>
shown together in Table 11 Further the legend is shown<br>
in Table 12<br>
Experiment Nos 1 to 249 show the results of<br>
consideration of the effects of the steel type plating<br>
type concentration of hydrogen in the atmosphere and<br>
dew point If in the scope of the invention no cracks<br>
occurred Experiment Nos 250 to 277 show the results of<br>
consideration of the timing of start of the shearing If<br>
in the scope of the invention no cracks occurred and the<br>
shape precision was also good<br>

Slabs of the chemical compositions shown in Table 4<br>
were cast These slabs were heated to 1050 to 1350Â°C then<br>
hot rolled at a finishing temperature of 800 to 900Â°C and<br>
a coiling temperature of 450 to 680Â°C to obtain hot rolled<br>

After hot shaping a hole of a diameter of 10 mm
made at the position shown in FIG 25 FIG 25 shows the<br>
shape of the part as seen from above The legend in FIG<br>
25 is shown here (1: part 2: hole part) As the working<br>

The working methods are shown together in Table 13 The<br>
legend in the table is shown next: laser working: "L"<br>
plasma cutting: "P" gas fusion cutting "G" drilling:<br>
"D" and sawing: "S" The above working was performed<br>
within 30 minutes after the hot shaping The resistance<br>
to hydrogen embrittlement was evaluated by examining the<br>
entire circumference of the holes one week after the<br>
working so as to judge the presence of any cracking The<br>
observation was performed using a loupe or electron<br>
microscope The results of judgment are shown together in<br>
Table 3<br>
Further the heat effect near the cut surface was<br>
examined for laser working plasma cutting and gas<br>
fusion cutting The cross-sectional hardness at a<br>
position 3 mm from the cut surface was examined by<br>
Vicker's hardness of a load of 10 kgf and compared with<br>
the hardness of a location 100 mm from the cut surface<br>
where it is believed there is no heat effect The results<br>
