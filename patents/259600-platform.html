Technical Field<br>
The present invention concerns a platform to be used<br>
as a support for displaying goods in a store, showroom, for<br>
transportation and storing of a number of relatively small<br>
10 packages etc'.<br>
Prior Art !<br>
Traditional pallets used for the transport of goods<br>
are often also used when the goods are to be displayed.<br>
15 Some special means as a trough may be placed on the pallet j<br>
or the .pallet may be introduced with the goods as, trans- ported or stored. In recent years loading ledges have been I<br>
introduced as a replacement for the traditional pallet. The<br>
loading ledges may be of' the type described in our Swedish<br>
20 Patent Application No. 0202779-5.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to be able to use<br>
the same loading ledges that are used for transportation<br>
25 and storing when displaying goods in a store, showroom etc.<br>
According to the present invention this is achieved, by i<br>
combining the loading ledges with, a blank of paperboard or I<br>
cardboard.to form a platform. Even if the blank is de- j<br>
scribed as being made of cardboard, a person skilled in the<br>
3 0 art realises that any material having, similarly characteristics<br>
may be used, e.g. different foldable plastic material<br>
such as corrugated•or flat plastic sheeting. The blank<br>
is designed and cut to co-operate with two or more loading<br>
ledges. The same loading ledges used for transportation or<br>
35- storing of the goods may then be used in forming the platform'<br>
for displaying the goods. Just folding the blank<br>
- 2 - -<br>
around the loading ledges in a suitable way forms the platform.<br>
Thus, no adhesives or other means are needed to hold<br>
the loading ledges and the blank together as one unit.<br>
Depending on the intended use and strength needed the<br>
5 blank may be given different designs. By using existing<br>
loading ledges together with a blank of cardboard the costs<br>
for manufacture and storing may be kept relatively low.<br>
Furthermore, the platform may be assembled quickly and easily-<br>
- •<br>
10 According to one aspect of the present invention the<br>
platform is load-bearing or load carrying, having both<br>
.transversal and longitudinal flaps folded around the load- I<br>
ing ledges. By folding the blank onto itself there will be<br>
two layers of cardboard, at least in parts of a support<br>
15 surface. The support surface .is formed between the vertical<br>
legs of the loading ledges. Adjusting the length of the<br>
parts where the cardboard is double may be used to control<br>
the bearing strength. A person skilled in the art realises<br>
that the platform according to the invention may be used to<br>
20 support anything, as long as the bearing strength of the<br>
platform is sufficient. The platform has a low weight and<br>
yet relatively good bearing capacity and strength.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention<br>
the platform is not load carrying in itself. One main func- i<br>
25 tion of the blank in this case is to be a distance element<br>
or spacer. The length of the blank is adapted to the dimensions<br>
of the package or the like holding the goods to be<br>
displayed. These kinds of platforms are normally fixed to<br>
the bottom of the packages or the like by a tape or other<br>
3 0 adhesive.<br>
In many instances the platforms, irrespective of<br>
type,'are used also during transportation from the manufacturer<br>
and in storing. 'In this way. there is no need for any<br>
reloading. The platform of the present invention may also<br>
3 5 be used as a basis for a number of small packages, having a<br>
size not making them suitable -to use with loading ledges on<br>
their own. Thus, in such a case the platform could replace<br>
a possible plate otherwise placed between two loading<br>
ledges.<br>
5 The exact form of the loading ledges is of no importance<br>
for the present invention, as long as the blank is<br>
adapted to the actual form of the loading ledges.<br>
• Further objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
will be obvious to a person skilled in the art when<br>
10 reading the detailed description below of preferred embodi- ments. •'<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
10 As used in this description the term "longitudinal"<br>
is the direction of the main extension of the loading<br>
ledges when the platform is formed. The term "transversal"<br>
f is used correspondingly for the perpendicular direction to<br>
"longitudinal". As used in this description the terms<br>
15 "horizontal", "vertical" and corresponding expressions are i<br>
in view of direction as shown in the enclosed drawings,<br>
i<br>
which coincide with the directions in normal use. I<br>
The same reference numbers are used in the drawings I<br>
for parts that are identical in the various embodiments '<br>
2 0 shown.<br>
...An example of a blank 1 for a platform according to i<br>
the present invention and a platform formed from the blank I<br>
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. However, it<br>
j should be noted that the platform is not intended for use<br>
25 on its own, but to be used with two loading ledges or the<br>
like as explained further below. The blank 1 is often made<br>
of cardboard or paperboard, i.e. corrugated paper. As indicated<br>
above, in other embodiments the blank is made of<br>
other materials, such as a corrugated or flat plastic sheet<br>
30 having some degree of stiffness. The shown blank 1 has two<br>
longitudinal flaps 2 and two-transversal flaps 3. Inside<br>
the flaps 2 , 3 a rectangular centre of the platform is<br>
formed. The longitudinal flaps 2 are arranged at the longer<br>
sides of the blank 1 and opposite each other. The' transversal<br>
flaps 3 are arranged at the shorter sides of the blank<br>
1 and'opposite each other.<br>
In the middle of each longitudinal flap 2 and adjacent<br>
the centre of the platform a rectangular opening 4 is<br>
5 formed. At the outer ends of the longitudinal flaps 2 a . |<br>
I<br>
number of fingers 5 are formed. In the shown embodiment<br>
four-fingers 5 are arranged at each flap 2 but the number<br>
and form of the fingers 5 may vary, depending on the design |<br>
of the loading ledges or the like to be.used with the plat-<br>
10 form. . i<br>
Each longitudinal flap 2 has'two longitudinal creases<br>
6, 7, extending along the total length of the flaps 2. One ,<br>
crease 6 is arranged adjacent the rectangular opening 4 of<br>
each longitudinal flap 2. The crease 6 is arranged in such<br>
15 a position that the opening'4 is placed between said crease-<br>
6 and the centre of the platform. The other of the longitudinal<br>
creases 7 is a double crease placed closer to the.<br>
outer end of the flap 2. The crease 7 is do^uble in that<br>
sense that the outer end of the flap 2 is to be folded onto<br>
20 itself, with a part of a loading-ledge 12 in-between.<br>
The transversal flaps 3 have a crease 8 each extending<br>
parallel with the short ends of the centre 'of the platform<br>
and along the whole of the transversal flap 3. The<br>
crease 8 is arranged about the middle of-each transversal<br>
25 flap 3 as shown. The length of the loading ledges 12 dictates<br>
the position of the crease 8.' The short end of the<br>
horizontal leg 14 of each loading ledge 12 is to be received<br>
"at the crease 8 when the transversal flap 3 is<br>
folded over. The crease 8 is double in that sense that each<br>
30 transversal flap 3 is to be folded onto itself, with a part<br>
of a loading ledge 12 in-between. The extension of the<br>
- transversal flaps 3 may be varied, depending on the desired<br>
stability of the platform formed! This is discussed further<br>
below in connection with the embodiments of Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
-6-<br>
i<br>
I<br>
• The outer end 9 of each transversal flap 3 is less<br>
extended in the transversal direction than the rest of the<br>
flap 3. Two opposite slits 10 are arranged between the<br>
outer end-9 of each transversal flap 3 and the rest of the<br>
5 .flap 3. The length of each slit 10 depends on the. dimen- •<br>
sions of the loading, ledges to be used. A crease 11 is arranged<br>
between the inner ends of each slit 10 and the free<br>
end of the outer end 9. The parts of the outer ends 9 outside<br>
each crease 11 are to be bent down under a loading<br>
10 ledge, when the platform is formed.<br>
In Fig. 3 one example of a loading ledge 12 is shown,<br>
which loading ledge' 12 may be used with the blank of Figs.<br>
1 and 2 to form a platform. As indicated in fig. 4 one<br>
blank 1 and two loading ledges 12 normally form the plat-<br>
15 form. :<br>
The loading ledges 12 have one vertical leg 13 and<br>
one horizontal leg 14. In the vertical leg 13 a number of<br>
holes 15 are arranged, originally to reduce the weight of<br>
the loading ledge 12. Furthermore, locking elements 16 for<br>
2 0 straps or the like are arranged on the vertical leg 13. On<br>
the lower side of the horizontal leg three feet 17, 18 are.<br>
arranged. The feet 17, 18 are furnished to enable handling I<br>
•by normal handling equipment, such as different types of |<br>
lift trucks. Two of the feet 17 are placed at the ends of<br>
25 the horizontal leg 14 and have a smaller longitudinal extent<br>
than the third foot 18 placed in the middle of the<br>
horizontal .leg 14.<br>
In use the central foot 18 of a loading ledge 12 is<br>
placed in each of the rectangular openings 4 of the longi-<br>
3 0 tudinal flaps 2, The feet 17 at the ends of the loading<br>
ledges 12 are normally placed adjacent the edges of the<br>
longitudinal flaps 2. In other embodiments also the feet 17<br>
at the ends are received in openings in the blank. The<br>
outer part of the longitudinal flaps 2 is folded over the<br>
3 5 outer end of the vertical leg 13 of the loading ledge 12 at<br>
the crease 7. The fingers 5 at the outer end of the flap 2<br>
are placed in suitable holes 15 of the loading ledge 12. In<br>
other embodiments the fingers 5 "of the flaps 2 are received<br>
in holes formed at the locking elements 16. Thus, each flap<br>
5 2 is held at a loading ledge 12 by co-operation between the<br>
fingers and the holes 15 of the horizontal leg 13 or the<br>
holes at the locking elements 16. With one loading ledge 12 i<br>
on each side the transversal flaps 3 are folded at the<br>
crease 8 and the parts of the outer part 9 of the transver-<br>
10 sal flaps 3 outside the creases 11 are pushed down under<br>
the horizontal leg 14 of each loading ledge 12. Thus, a<br>
platform is formed comprising one blank 1 and two loading<br>
ledges 12. A support surface is formed between the vertical<br>
legs 13,of the two loading ledges 12. The dimensions of the<br>
15 blank 2 may be adapted to the intended use, i.e.' the size<br>
of the package, container etc. to be used when displaying<br>
the goods.•<br>
As indicated in.the Figs. 5 and 6 the length of the<br>
transversal flaps 19, 2 0 may vary. In the embodiments of<br>
20 Figs. 5 and 6 the length of each transversal flaps 19, 2 0<br>
is such that the ends of the flaps 19, 20 will be placed<br>
adjacent each other when folded to form the platform. In<br>
the embodiment of Fig. 5 a tab 21 is formed at one end of<br>
one of the transversal flaps 20. Said tab 21 is to be re-<br>
2 5 ceived in a groove 22 formed in the other transversal flap<br>
20, when the platform is formed. In the embodiment of Fig.<br>
5 the end of the flap.2 0 has the same width as the rest of<br>
the flap. Thus, no part of the transversal flap 20 is to be<br>
placed under the'horizontal legs 14 of the loading ledges<br>
3 0 12. In another embodiment (not shown), the embodiments of<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 are combined. Thus, a tab 21 and a groove 22<br>
. are formed as in Fig. 5 while the rest of the.flaps correspond<br>
to the form-as shown in Fig. 6. In this latter embodiment<br>
the flaps are held down both by the co-operation<br>
-8'<br>
between'the tab 21 and the groove 22 as well as by parts of<br>
the flaps being placed under the loading ledges 12.<br>
By means of the flaps 19, 2 0 having ends placed adjacent<br>
each other in the finished platform-there will be-two<br>
5 layers of cardboard over the total support surface. Double<br>
cardboard means that the bearing strength is increased compared<br>
to the other embodiments having shorter transversal<br>
flaps 3. Thus, the length of the transversal flaps 19, 2 0<br>
influence the bearing strength of the platform to some ex-<br>
10 tent.<br>
The main difference between the blank 23 of Fig. 7<br>
and the previously discussed blanks is that the blank 23 of<br>
Fig. 7 has no transversal flaps. It does have two longitudinal<br>
flaps 2 4 and two openings 25, for receiving a middle<br>
15 foot 18 of a loading ledge 12 each. Furthermore, it has<br>
fingers 2 6 at the outer, free ends of the transversal flaps<br>
.24. The fingers 2 6 are to be received in holes at the locking<br>
elements 16 of the vertical legs 13 of the loading<br>
ledges 12.. A person skilled in the art realises that the<br>
2 0 fingers 2 6 as an alternative may be received in the holes<br>
15 of the vertical leg 13 of a loading ledge 12. The posi- ,<br>
tion of the fingers 26 'is adjusted depending on in which<br>
•<br>
openings or holes 15 they are to be received. Furthermore,<br>
the blank 23 has creases 27, 28 to enable the blank to be<br>
25 folded around two loading ledges 12. One crease 27 is<br>
placed adjacent each opening 25, for receiving a foot 18 of<br>
the loading ledge 12, at each end of the blank 23. Said<br>
crease 27 is to be positioned adjacent the outer corner between<br>
the. vertical and horizontal legs 13, 14 of respective<br>
. 30 loading ledge 12. The other crease 28 is double and the upper<br>
end of the vertical leg 13 of respective loading ledge<br>
is received at said crease 28 when the platform is formed.<br>
Each longitudinal flap 2 4 is to be folded onto itself with<br>
the vertical leg 13 of a loading ledge 12 in-between at<br>
35 said other crease 28.<br>
By using the blank 23 of Fig. 7 with two loading .<br>
ledges 12 a platform as shown in Fig. 8 may be formed. The<br>
platform is formed in that one loading ledge 12 is placed<br>
with the middle foot 18 in each opening 25 of the blank 23.<br>
5 Each long side of the, blank'23 is placed adjacent outer |<br>
feet 17 of the loading ledges 12. Each longitudinal flap 24<br>
is folded around the outside of each loading ledge 12 and<br>
the fingers 26 at the outer ends of the blank 23 are inserted<br>
from the inside in- suitable holes 15 or at the lock-<br>
10 ing elements 16. Thus, the blank 2.3 is held at the loading<br>
ledges 12 by means of the folding, by co-operation between<br>
the openings 25 of the blank 23 and the middle feet 18 of<br>
the loading ledges 12, and by co-operation between the fingers<br>
2 6 of the blank-23 and holes 15 or openings of the<br>
15 vertical leg 13 of each"loading ledge 12.<br>
In use the platform of Fig. 8 is often fixed to the<br>
bottom of a package or the like holding the goods to be<br>
stored. The fixation may be in form of a tape or other adhesive.<br>
Hereby the package is used in stabilising the plat-<br>
2 0 form.<br>
As an alternative the blank of Figs. 7 and 8 may be<br>
furnished with transversal flaps to be folded into two !<br>
i<br>
sides of a trough. The folding of the transversal flaps I<br>
would then correspond to the folding of the transversal |<br>
25 flaps as discussed in connection with Figs. 9 and 10 below.<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not shown) two' or more<br>
loading ledges are placed side by side on each side of the<br>
package or the like to be received. In such a case the<br>
blank is made broader and openings are provided in the<br>
3 0 blank for all feet of the loading ledges, except possibly i<br>
the outer feet at each end. The principles regarding folding<br>
etc. are the same as described above with one loading<br>
ledge at each side.<br>
In the embodiment-'of Figs. 9 and 10 the platform has<br>
the form of a trough, which may be useful if several<br>
smaller packages are received.<br>
• The blank 29 has two longitudinal flaps 3 0 and two<br>
5 transversal flaps 31. In addition to an opening 32 for each<br>
foot 18 in the middle of each loading ledge 12 it also has<br>
openings 33 for the feet 17 at the ends Of each loading<br>
ledge 12. The longitudinal flaps 30 are furnished with end<br>
flaps 34 at each end having a length corresponding to the<br>
10 length of the transversal flaps 31. A crease 35.is arranged<br>
between each longitudinal flap 3 0 and the centre part of<br>
the'blank 29. A crease 36 is placed between each longitudinal<br>
flap 30 and the end flaps 34.<br>
Each transversal flap 31 has three creases, a first<br>
15 crease 37, between the flap 31 and the centre part of the<br>
blank 29, a second crease 38, being a double crease somewhere<br>
in the middle between the first crease 37 and a third<br>
crease 39, which third crease is placed at the same distance<br>
from the second crease 3 8 as the second crease 3 8 is<br>
20 placed from the first crease 37. At the first crease two<br>
notches 40 are formed for co-operation with two tabs 41<br>
placed at the third crease 39.<br>
The platform is formed in that the blank 29 is folded<br>
around two loading ledges 12. Each loading ledge 12 is<br>
25 placed with its feet 17, 18 in the appropriate openings 32,<br>
33 of the blank 29. Then each longitudinal flap 30 is<br>
folded up against the horizontal leg 14 of the respective<br>
loading ledge 12. The end flap 34 of each longitudinal flap<br>
30 is folded in such a way that it is placed along the<br>
3 0 first crease 37 between the respective transversal flap 3<br>
and the centre part of the blank 29. With the end flaps 34<br>
placed along the first crease line 3 7 the transversal flap<br>
' 31 is folded around the end flaps 34. The part between the<br>
second and third creases 38, 39 is folded onto the part be-<br>
35 tween the first and second creases 37, 38 and these parts<br>
•<br>
are placed in a vertical position. The tabs 41 at the third<br>
crease 39 are at the same time placed in the notches 40 at<br>
the first crease 3 6 with' the outer, free end of each transversal<br>
flap 31 directed inwardly at the bottom of the<br>
5 trough formed. By altering the length of the outer part of<br>
the transversal flaps 31 the area having double layers at<br>
the centre of the platform may be adjusted, depending on<br>
