This invention relates to a device to sense and suck  roving break in a spinning machine.<br>
Fly frames or speed frames provided in any fly spinning machines, sliver drawn out or attenuated by a drafting roller is passed to the flyer which alternates roving in preparation for the next step which is spinning. During this step, short fibre wastes tend to reach the flyer which will adversely affect the quality of the spun yarn and the spinning operations. Conventional spinning machines are provided with means to sense roving breakage and means to prevent short fibre wastes from entering the flyer which will be briefly described hereinafter. A suction flute is provided in front of the flyer for sucking broken roving. The bottom end of the suction flute is connected to a suction channel which runs either through the entire length of the machine or at least part of it to reach a waste collection chamber. Sensing elements are provided at the end of this suction channel to detect any breakage by sensing the broken roving passing through the sensing element and thereby signalling to stop the machine. A separator plate is also provided to separate the roving from short fibre wastes. The suction flute attracts short fibre wastes and any broken roving which pass through the suction channel to the waste collection chamber. Sensing elements provided at the end of the suction channel senses roving breaks when the broken roving passes therethrough. The machine is stopped on receipt of signals received from the sensing means regarding such roving breaks. This method of sensing roving break and stopping the machine has certain obvious drawbacks. There is a tangible delay in stopping the machine after roving breakage as sensing of the breakage takes place only<br><br>
when the roving reaches the sensing element after travelling through the entire length of the suction channel, resulting in consequential delay and production loss. Yet another drawback of the existing system is that the bobbin rotates without any roving supply till the break is sensed by the sensor means. This leads to winding imperfections adversely affecting the quality of the yarn produced. It is also observed that often the suction produced by this arrangement is ineffective and insufficient.<br>
The present invention has been developed in order to overcome the above discussed drawbacks of the existing system. The improved roving suction arrangement developed according to this invention aims at detecting roving breaks on the spot to sense and signal stoppage of the machine. Suction and sensing elements are located in a housing provided between a set of flyers and drafting rollers. The housing is placed perpendicular to the path of the roving and is inclined towards the flyers. The angle of inclination is adjustable with the help of adjusting means. The top of the housing has a plurality of curves each curve having an opening at its centre. These curved surfaces intersect the path of each of the passing rovings. Each opening of the curved surfaces is provided with a suction nozzle and the suction nozzle has means for sucking housed within. Sensing means are provided in between two of such curved surfaces of the housing. The bottom portion of the housing has a duct which is connected to a waste collecting chamber. The sensing elements sense the roving passing through the curved surfaces on both the sides and during any breakage, signals are sent to stop the machine  immediately.   The  suction nozzles  provided on  the<br><br>
openings of the curved surfaces such the broken roving. Similarly, these suction nozzles attract short fibre wastes and prevent them from reaching the flyer. The sucked waste material travels through the suction nozzle to the bottom of the housing and are discharged into the waste collection chamber through the duct at the base of the housing. Inclination of the housing can be adjusted to regulate the suction force and to maintain perpendicularity to the path of the roving.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a device to sense and suck roving breaks in a spinning machine comprises a housing located between a set of flyers and drafting rollers, the said housing being perpendicular to the path of the rovings and adjustably inclined to the flyers, the top of the housing having a plurality of curved surfaces, each opening into a suction nozzle, a plurality of sensing elements each provided in between two curved surfaces, the base of the said housing having a duct connected to a waste collection chamber.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 and II of the accompanying drawing which shows the front side view and the side view of the device.<br>
Reference numeral (1) represents the housing and numeral (2) represents the plurality of curved roving slots. Plurality of suction nozzle is indicated by the reference numeral (3) and reference numeral (4) represents the plurality of sensor unit. The said sensor unit (4) is housed within the housing (1). The plurality of sensor of the said sensing unit (4) is represented by the reference numeral (7). Reference numerals (5) represents the adjusting means of the said sensing unit employed for adopting the insensitivity of sensing of the said sensor unit (4) and reference numeral (6) indicates the indicating lamp provided on the said sensor unit (4) to identify the location of roving  breakage.   Reference numeral (8)<br><br>
represents the duct provided at the bottom of the housing which is linked to the waste collection chamber. The broken roving and the short fibres generated are sucked by the collection chamber. The position of the device can be adjusted and locked at the required position by the locking screw (9). During the normal working of the machine the plurality roving passes in the said curved roving slots (2). The light beam emitted by the said sensor is obstructed by the roving. When the roving break occurs, the absence of the roving is sensed by the sensor (7), for example the light emitted by the said sensor is reflected back to the said sensor (7). Thus the roving break is identified and a signal generated by the said sensor (7) which is being sent to a programmable logic control connected to the control circuit. The said programmable logic control in turn switch off the main motor and the machine is stopped or else the machine can be allowed to continue working with an indication by the said indication lamp (6) about the roving break.<br>
For example the sensor (7) used is selected from photo electric sensors of reflection type, photo electric sensors of diffused light type, photo electric sensors of through beam type.<br>
The device serves as a separating means of the rovings, sensing means for sensing the roving breakage and as a means for sucking the broken roving and the short fibres generated.<br><br>
When installed in a flyer type spinning machine, the device will help in simplifying short fibre waste collection. The device also minimises the period of sensing roving break and subsequent stoppage of the machine thereafter. This enhances production rate and provides better quality products.<br>
