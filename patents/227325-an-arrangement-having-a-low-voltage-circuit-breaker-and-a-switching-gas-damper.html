				<td>Description<br>
Arrangement having a low-voltage power breaker and a<br>
switching gas damper, which is provided with a bearing<br>
element, for the low-voltage power breaker<br>
The invention relates to the field of electrical<br>
switches and can be used when designing a switching gas<br>
damper for low-voltage power breakers, in particular<br>
for low-voltage power breakers which can be inserted in<br>
low-voltage switchgear assemblies.<br>
Air-break low-voltage power breakers require for<br>
operation an arc-quenching device in order to cause<br>
switching arcs which occur to be quenched without<br>
impairing the power breaker itself and adjacent parts<br>
of the assembly or other modules. On the other hand,<br>
there is the risk of the hot and thus ionized arc gases<br>
causing electrical flashovers, injuring operating<br>
personnel or causing other damage.<br>
It is known, on the one hand, to provide arc-quenching<br>
chambers which accommodate the arc to be quenched and<br>
are designed for the temperature and pressure of the<br>
switching gases occurring. In order in particular<br>
applications of low-voltage power breakers, for example<br>
when they are installed in tightly restricted areas, to<br>
achieve further cooling and final ionization of the<br>
switching gases, it is known, in addition to the arc-<br>
quenching chamber, to provide a switching gas damper<br>
which is arranged in the flow path of the switching<br>
gases, downstream of the quenching chamber.<br>
DE 35 41 514 C2 proposes, for this purpose, arranging<br>
an attachment on the arc-quenching chamber which<br>
accommodates a number of perforated inserts, these<br><br>
inserts being, for example, sheets provided with<br>
closely adjacent perforations or sections of a wire<br>
fabric.<br><br>
A similar switching gas damper is known from<br>
US 6,248,971 Bl, in accordance with which perforated<br>
plates are likewise provided.<br>
A further switching gas damper is known from<br>
DE 298 07 119 Ul. However, instead of the plates or<br>
instead of a wire fabric, xn this case parallel webs<br>
are provided which are arranged such that they are<br>
offset.<br>
DE 1JL 54 066 A has disclosed an arrangement having a<br>
low-voltage power breaker and a switching gas damper,<br>
which is provided with a bearing element, for the low-<br>
voltage power breaker, in which the switching gas<br>
damper is arranged above an open arc-quenching chamber<br>
of the low-voltage power breaker and has at least one<br>
inlet opening for switching gases and at least one<br>
outlet opening for damped or completely ionized<br>
switching gases, and in which the bearing element can<br>
be fixed on a housing accommodating the low-voltage<br>
power breaker above the arc-quenching chamber and forms<br>
at least one accommodating area for a flow element<br>
which builds up a flow resistance for the switching<br>
gases, the bearing element forming the at least one<br>
inlet opening. However, the solution is very space-<br>
intensive .<br>
A less space-intensive solution is given by<br>
EP 0 437 151 Al. In this case, the switching gas damper<br>
is arranged on a switchgear cell, which accommodates<br>
the power breaker, immediately adjacent to the arc-<br>
quenching chamber. The switching gas damper comprises<br>
an integral housing having openings on its upper side.<br>
The housing interior is divided into two regions by<br>
means of a perforated plate. Such a design is<br>
unfavorable in terms of manufacturing. In addition, the<br><br>
housing interior is only accessible once the entire<br>
switching gas damper has been removed from the<br>
switchgear assembly.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a<br>
switching gas damper of the generic type which is<br>
characterized by a simple and compact design and which<br>
does not increase the blowout space provided (expansion<br>
space above the arc chamber).<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a<br>
switching gas damper having the features mentioned in<br>
claim 1. The fact that the at least one accommodating<br>
area can be closed by at least one closure element<br>
which fixes the at least one flow element, and the fact<br>
that the at least one closure element forms the at<br>
least one outlet opening advantageously means that the<br>
flow element can be fitted on the switching gas damper<br>
in a simple manner and precautions can be taken for<br>
safe damping and complete ionization of the switching<br>
gases in a very narrow space.<br><br>
The bearing element of the switching gas damper and<br>
thus the switching gas damper as a whole is preferably<br>
fixed on a withdrawable part rack for the power<br>
breaker. This means that the switching gas damper is<br>
formed and can be arranged independently of the low-<br>
voltage power breaker and independently of the shape of<br>
the internal area of a switchgear cell above the<br>
withdrawable part rack. To this extent, the physical<br>
shape and physical size can be adapted in a simple<br>
manner to different withdrawable part racks or to<br>
different low-voltage power breakers, and possibly to<br>
different quenching chambers of low-voltage power<br>
breakers. However, it is not necessary to adapt the<br>
switchgear cells of switchgear cabinets or switchgear<br>
assemblies. The switching gas damper according to the<br>
invention is thus characterized by having a high degree<br>
of flexibility as regards its design and its<br>
arrangement.<br>
One preferred refinement of the invention provides for<br>
the accommodating area for the flow element to be<br>
formed by a trough-like depression in the bearing<br>
element. This advantageously means that the height of<br>
the bearing element (physical height) can also at the<br>
same time be utilized for the arrangement of the flow<br>
element, with the result that the switching gas damper<br>
as a whole is characterized by a very flat design.<br>
Furthermore, the trough-like depression at the same<br>
time serves the purpose of positioning the at least one<br>
flow element in a positionally accurate manner, with<br>
the result that operation is prevented from being<br>
impaired by the flow elements being displaced or being<br>
positioned incorrectly. In particular, it is further<br>
preferred if a base of the trough-like depression,<br>
whilst forming an at least partially - peripheral<br>
retaining web, at the same time forms the inlet opening<br><br>
for the switching gases into the switching gas damper.<br>
This ensures that there is a good flow onto the at<br>
least one flow element and, at the same time, its<br>
positioning in the accommodating area (trough-like<br>
depression) is not impaired.<br><br>
One further preferred refinement of the invention<br>
provides for the at least one flow element to be formed<br>
by steel wire nets which are preferably arranged in<br>
layers. This makes it possible to achieve a flow<br>
element which corresponds to the requirements using the<br>
smallest possible amount of space by means of the steel<br>
wire nets, with the result that, despite the small<br>
physical area taken up by the switching gas damper as a<br>
whole, effective damping and complete ionization of the<br>
switching gases is ensured.<br>
One preferred refinement of the invention also provides<br>
for the bearing element to form a number, which<br>
corresponds to the number of switching poles of the<br>
low-voltage power breaker, of accommodating areas for<br>
flow elements. This makes it possible to assign a<br>
dedicated switching gas damper to each switching pole,<br>
it being possible for said switching gas dampers to be<br>
integrated as a common, compact component in the low-<br>
voltage switchgear assembly.<br>
Furthermore, one preferred refinement of the invention<br>
provides for the bearing element to have, on its side<br>
facing the arc-quenching chamber, at least one groove-<br>
like depression which preferably passes peripherally<br>
around the inlet openings for the switching gases.<br>
These at least one, preferably two or more,<br>
depressions, which in particular also cross over one<br>
another, result in an increase in the size of the<br>
leakage paths, with the result that, even after the<br>
bearing element has been blackened, for example in the<br>
event of a short-circuit disconnection, sufficient<br>
dielectric strength remains between the poles of the<br>
switching gas damper. In addition, an untrue gas<br>
labyrinth is created for the switching gas which forms<br>
a flow resistance for the switching gases, with the<br>
result	that	said	switching<br><br>
gases are thus reliably fed to the at least one inlet<br>
opening in a switching gas damper. The arrangement of<br>
additional splitters, possibly requiring additional<br>
physical space, or the like is thus not necessary.<br><br>
Further, preferred refinements of the invention result<br>
from the other features mentioned in the subclaims.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below in<br>
an exemplary embodiment with reference to the<br>
accompanying<br>
associated drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a perspective view of an arrangement<br>
which comprises a withdrawable part rack,<br>
which is provided with a switching gas<br>
damper, and a withdrawn low-voltage power<br>
breaker;<br>
figure 2 shows an exploded illustration of a switching<br>
gas damper, and<br>
figures 3a to 3d show different views of the switching<br>
gas damper.<br>
Figure 1 shows a withdrawable part rack denoted 10 and<br>
a low-voltage power breaker denoted 1. By means of the<br>
withdrawable part rack 10, the low-voltage power<br>
breaker 1 can be introduced into a switchgear cell (not<br>
shown) of a low-voltage switchgear cabinet or a low-<br>
voltage switchgear assembly. The low-voltage power<br>
breaker itself is not completely shown, since its<br>
design and operation are generally known.<br>
A switching gas damper which is as a whole denoted 12<br>
is assigned to the arc-quenching chambers 2 of the low-<br>
voltage power breaker 1. The switching gas damper 12 is<br>
in this case arranged above the arc-quenching chambers,<br>
to be precise immediately adjacent to said arc-<br>
quenching chambers such that outlet openings 5 of the<br>
arc-quenching chambers 2 face the switching gas damper.<br>
The switching gas damper 12 itself is connected in a<br><br>
force-fitting manner to side walls 3, 4 of the<br>
withdrawable part rack 10 by means of fixing elements<br>
14, which can be formed,<br><br>
for example, by screw connections, latching connections<br>
or the like.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exploded illustration of the<br>
switching gas damper 12. The switching gas damper 12<br>
comprises a bearing element 16, by means of which the<br>
switching gas damper 12 is fixed to the withdrawable<br>
part rack 10 using the fixing elements 14. The<br>
switching gas damper 12 can be positioned by means of<br>
spacer elements 18. By selecting the size, in<br>
particular the height of the spacer elements 18, it is<br>
possible to space the switching gas damper 12, in this<br>
case in particular the underside 20 of the switching<br>
gas damper 12, from the arc-quenching chamber of the<br>
low-voltage power breaker. This spacing is selected to<br>
be as small as possible and is, for example,<br>
approximately 1 mm.<br>
The bearing element 16 is made of, for example,<br>
hardboard or a duroplast material.<br>
The bearing element 16 has three apertures 22. The<br>
apertures 22 form inlet openings 24 for the switching<br>
gases emerging from the arc-quenching chamber on the<br>
underside 2 0 of the bearing element 16. The inlet<br>
openings 24 are delimited by an edge-side web 26. The<br>
web 26 is formed such that it passes peripherally<br>
around the edge of the apertures 22, in accordance with<br>
the embodiment illustrated. This results in trough-like<br>
depressions 28 being formed within the bearing element<br>
16. At their base, the trough-like depressions 28 are<br>
thus delimited by the web 2 6 and the inlet openings 24.<br>
In accordance with further embodiments, in each case<br>
one web 26 can be provided, for example, only on<br>
opposing narrow sides or long sides. It is also<br>
possible to form the web 26 such that it is not<br>
continuous, but to form it from tooth-like projections<br><br>
or the like which are arranged such that they are<br>
spaced apart from one another. This makes it possible<br>
to increase<br><br>
the size of the effective inlet opening 24 without<br>
increasing the size of the apertures 22.<br>
Essentially two-dimensional flow elements 30 are<br>
introduced into the trough-like depressions 28. The<br>
flow elements 30 are formed, for example, by steel wire<br>
nets. They can be formed in one layer or else in a<br>
plurality of layers. The steel wire nets may be folded<br>
in meandering fashion and introduced into the trough-<br>
like depressions 28 as a block. In place of the steel<br>
wire nets, other flow elements may also be introduced,<br>
for example perforated plates, mat elements or the<br>
like.<br>
The height of the flow elements 30 corresponds to the<br>
height of the trough-like depressions 28. This means<br>
that the flow elements 30 lie within the trough-like<br>
depression 28 on the webs 26 and that their surface is<br>
essentially flush with the surface of the bearing<br>
element 16.<br>
The switching gas damper 12 also comprises closure<br>
elements 32, which can be connected in a force-fitting<br>
manner to the bearing element 16 by means of fixing<br>
elements 34, for example screws. The flow elements 30<br>
are fixed in the trough-like depressions 28 by means of<br>
the closure elements 32. The closure elements 32 have<br>
apertures 36, which may be in the form of, for example,<br>
slots (as illustrated) , holes, elongate holes or the<br>
like. All of the areas of the apertures 36 of a closure<br>
element 32 thus form the outlet opening for the<br>
switching gases from the switching gas damper 12.<br>
It becomes clear from the explanations relating to<br>
figure 2 that the switching gas damper 12 as a whole<br>
has a very compact design which, in particular,<br>
requires a low installation height. The switching gas<br>
damper 12 can thus also be<br><br>
integrated in low-voltage switchgear assemblies, in<br>
particular in withdrawable part racks for low-voltage<br>
power breakers, which have only a limited amount of<br>
installation space available.<br>
In accordance with the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated, the switching gas damper 12 forms three<br>
flow paths for the switching gases, for example for a<br>
three-pole low-voltage power breaker. In accordance<br>
with further exemplary embodiments, the number of flow<br>
paths can vary. It is thus conceivable even to provide<br>
a flow path for a multi-pole low-voltage power breaker.<br>
Correspondingly, the number of apertures 22 and flow<br>
elements 30 and closure elements 32 would be reduced.<br>
Figure 3 shows once again different views of the<br>
switching gas damper 12, figure 3a showing a side view,<br>
figure 3b a view from below, figure 3c a front view,<br>
and figure 3d a plan .view. Identical parts to those in<br>
the previous figures are provided with identical<br>
reference numerals and are not explained again.<br>
The very compact, in particular flat design of the<br>
switching gas damper 12 can again be seen in this<br>
illustration.<br>
As is shown, in particular, in the view from below in<br>
figure 3b, groove-like depressions 38 are provided on<br>
the underside 20 of the bearing element 16 and surround<br>
the inlet opening 24. In accordance with the exemplary<br>
embodiment shown, two depressions 38, which are<br>
arranged parallel to one another, are provided in the<br>
longitudinal extent of the switching gas damper 12 and<br>
three depressions 38, which are arranged parallel to<br>
one another, are provided in the transverse extent of<br>
the switching gas damper 12. These depressions thus<br><br>
cross over one another. These groove-like depressions<br>
38 increase the size of the leakage paths, with the<br>
result that, even after the bearing element has been<br>
blackened, for example in the event of short-circuit disconnections, sufficient dielectric strength remains<br>
between the poles of the<br><br>
switching gas damper. In addition, an untrue gas<br>
labyrinth for the switching gases emerging from the<br>
arc-quenching chambers of the low-voltage power breaker<br>
is formed for the switching gas. The depressions 38<br>
thus form a flow resistance for the switching gases and<br>
thus form almost guiding elements for the switching<br>
gases, with the result that said switching gases can<br>
flow into the respectively assigned inlet opening 24.<br><br>
