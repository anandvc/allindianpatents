RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present application claims all benefits of the Chinese application No. 200710163464.4, filed on October 25, 2007, entitled “a process for continuously producing 3-isothiazolinone derivatives”, which is explicitly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present application is directed to a process for producing 3-isothiazolinone derivatives. More particularly, the present application is directed to a process for continuously producing 3-isothiazolinone derivatives and intermediate products thereof.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTS<br>
[0003]	Isothiazolinone compounds belong to a class of novel broad-spectrum bactericide, which have high efficiency, broad spectrum, low toxicity, innocuity under using concentration, natural degradation in the environment, and the like. Therefore, isothiazolinone compounds are widely used in the fields of industrial water treatment, paper making, cosmetics, construction materials, bonding adhesive, paints, medical treatment and public health, textiles, photography, detergents, and the like. In particular, 2-alkyl-4,5-disubstituted-4-isothiazolin-3-ones are better bactericides and preservatives.<br><br>
[0004]	The production of 3-isothiazolinone derivatives generally comprises four steps, i.e. sulfuration, purification, amination and chlorination. The corresponding reaction equations are as follows:<br><br>
1. CH2=CHCO2CH3 + H2S + S ? (SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + S(SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2<br>
I        				    II      			  III<br><br>
2. S(SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + Na2SO3 ? (SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + Na2S2O3<br>
III           					  II<br><br>
3. (SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + NH2R ? (SCH2CH2CONHR)2 + CH3OH<br>
II    		  IV   		   V<br><br>
4. (SCH2CH2CONHR)2 + Cl2 ? IT-HCl + HCl<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	In the following description, certain specific details are included to provide a thorough understanding of various disclosed embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art, however, will recognize that embodiments may be practiced without one or more of these specific details, or with other processes, components, materials, and the like.<br><br>
[0024]	Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and claims which follow, the word “comprise” and variations thereof, such as, “comprises” and “comprising” are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, which is as “including, but not limited to”.<br><br>
[0025]	Reference throughout this specification to “one embodiment”, or “an embodiment”, or “in another embodiment”, or “some embodiments”, or “in some embodiments” means that a particularly referred feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearance of the phrases “in one embodiment”, or “in an embodiment”, or “in another embodiment”, or “in some embodiments” in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.<br><br>
[0026]	It should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a solvent containing “a substance having polyhydroxy and/or polyamino groups” includes a single substance having polyhydroxy and/or polyamino groups, or two or more substances having polyhydroxy and/or polyamino groups. It should also be noted that the term “or” is generally employed in its sense including “and/or” unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br><br>
Definition<br>
[0027]	Certain chemical groups named herein are preceded by a shorthand notation indicating the total number of carbon atoms that are to be found in the indicated chemical group. For example, C7-C12 alkyl describes an alkyl group, as defined below, having a total of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and C4-C12 cycloalkylalkyl describes a cycloalkylalkyl group, as defined below, having a total of 4 to 12 carbon atoms. The total number of carbons in the shorthand notation does not include carbons that may exist in substituents of the group described.<br><br>
[0028]	As used herein, “Cm to Cn” or “Cm to n” in which “m” and “n” are integers refers to the number of carbon atoms in an alkyl, or the number of carbon atoms in the ring of a cycloalkyl group. That is, the alkyl or ring of the cycloalkyl can contain from “m” to “n”, carbon atoms. Thus, for example, a “C1 to C4 alkyl” group refers to all alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbons, that is, CH3-, CH3CH2-, CH3CH2CH2-, (CH3)2CH-, CH3CH2CH2CH2-, CH3CH2CH(CH3)- and (CH3)3C-. If no “m” and “n” are designated with regard to an alkyl or cycloalkyl group, the broadest range described in these definitions is to be assumed.<br><br>
[0029]	Accordingly, as used in the specification and appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated:<br><br>
[0030]	The term “alkyl” as used herein means any unbranched or branched, substituted or unsubstituted, saturated hydrocarbon. The alkyl moiety may be branched, straight chain, or cyclic. The alkyl group may have 1 to 18 carbon atoms (whenever it appears herein, e.g., a numerical range such as “1 to 18” refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “1 to 18 carbon atoms” means that the alkyl group may consist of 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, and the like., up to and including 18 carbon atoms, although the present definition also covers the occurrence of the term “alkyl” where no numerical range is designated). The alkyl group may also be a medium size alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The alkyl group could also be a lower alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The alkyl group may be designated as “C1-C4 alkyl” or similar designations. By way of example only, “C1-C4 alkyl” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, i.e., the alkyl chain is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl.<br><br>
[0031]	The alkyl group may be substituted or unsubstituted. When substituted, the substituent group(s) is(are) one or more group(s) individually and independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, alkylthio, halo, carbonyl, keto, nitro, silyl, trihalomethanesulfonyl, and amino groups including disubstituted amino groups. Typical alkyl groups include, but are in no way limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, iso-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. Wherever a substituent is described as being “optionally substituted”, that substitutent may be substituted with one of the above substituents.<br><br>
[0032]	The term “cycloalkyl” as used herein alone or as part of a group refers to a completely saturated (no double bonds) mono- or multi- cyclic hydrocarbon ring system. When composed of two or more rings, the rings may be joined together in a bridged or spiro-connected fashion. Cycloalkyl groups of this application may range from C3 to C18. In some embodiments, it may range from C3 to C10. In some embodiments, it may range from C3 to C6. A cycloalkyl group may be substituted or unsubstituted. Typical cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. If substituted, the substituent(s) may be an alkyl or selected from those indicated above with regard to substitution of an alkyl group unless otherwise indicated.<br><br>
[0033]	The term “halo” or “halogen” refers to bromo, chloro, fluoro or iodo.<br><br>
[0034]	The term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur, and that the specification includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not.<br><br>
[0035]	Unless stated otherwise, when one substituent is regarded as “optionally substituted”, it means that the substituent may be individually and independently substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of cycloalkyl, alkylthio, arylthio, halo, carbonyl, silyl, trihalomethanesulfonyl and amino groups including disubstituted amino groups.<br><br>
[0036]	For example, “optionally substituted aryl” means that said aryl may be substituted or may not be substituted, and the Specification includes substituted aryl groups and aryl groups without substituents.<br><br>
[0037]	As used herein, the term “reaction device” may refer to a single reaction device or a reaction device system composed of several reaction devices connected in series or in parallel.<br><br>
[0038]	As used herein, the term “reactor” refers to a device suitable for carrying out a chemical reaction, which includes, but is not limited to, kettle, pot, tank, column and the like.<br><br>
[0039]	“H2S, primary amine, chlorine” used in the present application may be gaseous or liquid.<br><br>
[0040]	In the art of the present application, a batch process, also referred to as an intermittent process, refers to that all the steps are carried out at the same location but at different times. The operation conditions of the process are unstable, and the parameters of the process vary over time. For example, a batch of materials is added into a device. The products are discharged in batch after operation. The device is cleaned. New materials are added into the device again. Such a process is repeated.<br><br>
[0041]	A continuous process in the art refers to that all the steps are carried out at different locations but at the same time. The operation conditions are stable and the raw materials are fed and the final products are yielded continuously. During the operation, various parameters of the materials at any location actually remain constant. It is easy for a continuous process to achieve mechanization and automation. The products from the process have uniform quality and the devices for the process are compact. The process also has the advantages of larger production capacity, less intensity of work and the like.<br><br>
[0042]	A semi-continuous process in the art is a combination of a continuous process and a batch process. In other words, in the whole production process, some steps are carried out in a continuous process while other steps are carried out in a batch process. For example, in a solid-liquid separation settler, the liquid mixture to be separated, which is a thin suspension, is continuously fed. The supernatant liquids continuously overflow the top of the settler while the precipitates settled on the bottom are discharged after being accumulated to a certain amount. This process is a semi-continuous process.<br><br>
[0043]	In series (reaction devices connected in series) generally mean that the materials leaving the previous reaction device is the feed of the next reaction device. The materials are continuously added to the first reaction device, flow successively through each reaction device, and are discharged from the last reaction device.<br><br>
[0044]	In parallel (reaction devices connected in parallel) generally mean that the inlet pipes of all the reaction devices are combined together and the outlet pipes are also combined together, i.e., reaction devices are connected in such a way that the reaction devices separate from one point and converge at another point.<br><br>
Reaction Scheme<br>
[0100]	As described previously, the production of 3-isothiazolinone derivatives generally comprises four steps, i.e., sulfuration, purification, amination and chlorination, all of which are carried out in a batch process in the prior art. To overcome a defect of the prior art and establish a modified process for producing 3-isothiazolinone derivatives, the present inventors conducted an in-depth research on the above mentioned four-step reaction process.<br><br>
[0046]	Reaction process of sulfuration:<br><br>
CH2=CHCO2CH3 + H2S + S ? (SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + S(SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2<br>
I           				  II    			    III<br><br>
[0047]	To a reaction kettle was added an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfide and sulfur powder. The resultant mixture was cooled. A compound of formula I was then added dropwise with stirring meanwhile H2S was introduced. The raw materials were added over several hours. The resultant mixture was stood to separate so as to give a liquid mixture of a compound of formula II and a compound of formula III. Through monitoring the reaction via chromatography analysis, it was found that the reaction completes within several minutes to generate a compound of formula II and a compound of formula III after a compound of formula I was added into the reaction kettle. The time was mainly spent on feeding, cooling and separating.<br><br>
[0048]	Reaction process of purification:<br><br>
S(SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + Na2SO3 ? (SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + Na2S2O3<br>
III         				    II<br><br>
[0049]	Into a reaction kettle was added a liquid mixture of a compound of formula II and a compound of formula III and a suitable amount of an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite. The resultant mixture was heated and stirred for several hours. The organic layer was washed with water. The mixture was separated to give a refined compound of formula II. Through monitoring the reaction via chromatography analysis, it was found that the compound of formula III was transformed to the compound of formula II within tens of minutes under the controlled temperature range. Therefore, it was not necessary to complete the reaction over several hours.<br><br>
[0050]	Reaction process of amidation:<br><br>
(SCH2CH2CO2CH3)2 + NH2R ? (SCH2CH2CONHR)2 + CH3OH<br>
II    		  IV    		  V<br>
wherein R represents C1-C18 alkyl or C3-C18 cycloalkyl.<br><br>
[0051]	A reaction kettle was cooled. To the reaction kettle were added a refined compound of formula II and a solution of a primary amine of formula IV in alcohol. The resultant mixture was stirred for tens of hours and separated to give a compound of formula V with purity of more than 98%. Through monitoring the reaction via chromatography analysis, it was found that the generation speed of a compound of formula V was fastest in the first 10 hours of the reaction and was nearly constant, and then gradually decreased. The amount of an intermediate reaches the maximum after 5 hours of reaction. The compound of formula II was consumed by about 85% within the first 10 hours of reaction. The rest time were only spent by the remaining 15% of the compound of formula II on transforming to the intermediate and by about 37% of the generated intermediate on transforming to a compound of formula V (see Table 1).<br><br>

[0052]	Reaction process of chlorination:<br><br>
(SCH2CH2CONHR)2 + Cl2 ? IT-HCl + HCl<br>
V      			  VI<br>
wherein , R represents C1-C18 alkyl or C3-C18 cycloalkyl, and R1 and R2 independently represent H or chlorine.<br><br>
[0053]	Into a reaction device was added ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate was cooled. A compound of formula V and chlorine were added at the same time in batch with stirring (for example, R=CH3) within several hours. A solid-liquid separation of the mixture was carried out to give a compound of formula VI (for example, R=CH3, R1=H, R2=H or Cl) as a solid. Through monitoring the reaction via chromatography analysis, it was found that the reaction was completed within several minutes after a compound of formula V was added into the reaction device. Like the reaction of sulfuration, feeding and cooling occupied the most of the time.<br><br>
[0054]	Based on the above results and a large number of experiments, the inventors eventually completed the continuous process for producing 3-isothiazolinone derivatives of the present application.<br><br>
