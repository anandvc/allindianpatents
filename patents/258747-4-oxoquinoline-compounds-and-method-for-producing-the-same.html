[0036]<br>
While patent reference 1, patent reference 2 and patent reference 3 disclose production methods of compound (10) , the production methods embrace the following aspects. ■ In the final step (alkoxylation, particularly methoxylation), a dimer is by-produced depending on the base to be used.  In this event, a removal step of the by-produced dimer is further necessary, which decreases the yield greatly.<br><br>
■	When sodium fluoride by-produced in the final step (alkoxylation, particularly methoxylation) is acidified in the treatment step, hydrofluoric acid is produced and corrodes the production facility.  Thus, a removal operation of sodium fluoride is essential and the operation is complicated.<br>
■	There is a concern about an unfavorable influence of hydrofluoric acid produced in the ring-closing step on the production facility, and therefore, the method is not of a level satisfactory as an industrial production method.<br>
■	Removal of the product by-produced in a reaction to insert compound [lib] is complicated (since alkylzinc derivative is used together with a palladium catalyst, an operation to remove zinc salt and palladium salt as impurities is necessary and the operation is complicated) .<br>
■	Plural operations are necessary to protect hydroxyl group with methyl chloroformate in a preliminary step of the reaction to insert compound [lib], and to deprotect the group in a later step, and the operation is complicated .<br>
■	A step using 3-chloro-2-fluorobenzyl bromide for the production of compound [lib] is not benefical for industrial production, since the compound shows high tearing property.<br>
The above-mentioned production method including these steps is associated with many aspects to be improved for industrial production, and the development of a more superior production method of compound (10) is desired. [0037]<br>
In addition, while non-patent reference 1 describes the following benzoic acid compound and the like, it provides no description of the compound (2') of the present invention to be explained in detail in the following. [0038]<br><br><br>
[0039]<br>
Moreover, patent reference 4 describes, in the ring-closing reaction for forming a 4-oxoquinoline skeleton, a production example of a 4-oxoquinoline skeleton from the iollowing acrylic acid ester and the like.  However, it provides 10 description of the production method of compound (9) from :ompound (7), or compound (8) from compound (6-B) of the present Invention to be explained in detail in the following. ;0040]<br><br>
[0041]<br>
Patent reference 5 (see page 11, compound 2-12) describes che following benzoic acid compound [A] and the like as photosensitive materials.  However, it provides no  description Df the compound (2') of the present invention to be explained in detail in the following. [0042]<br><br>

Effect of the Invention<br><br>
[0399]<br>
The present invention can provide a novel compound useful as a synthetic intermediate for an anti-HIV agent (compound) having an integrase inhibitory activity, a production method of the synthetic intermediate, and a production method of an anti-HIV agent (compound) (e.g., compound (10) and the like) using the synthetic intermediate.<br>
[0400]<br>
The present invention can provide an industrially highly valuable production method of an anti-HIV agent (compound).  For example, using intermediate compound (2') [compound (2-2): compounds (2-2-A) and (2-2-B) and/or compound (2-3): compounds (2-3-A) and (2-3-B)] having a methoxy group as a synthetic intermediate for the production of compound (10), which is an anti-HIV agent (compound), a decrease in the yield due to the final step (alkoxylation, particularly methoxylation) in the prior art and by-production of sodium fluoride can be avoided. Using compound (2') in a ring-closing step, moreover, the generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) that causes corrosion of the production facility can be avoided, whereby problems in the prior art (avoidance of decreased yield, corrosion of production facility, etc.) can be overcome.<br>
[0401]<br>
Further, the present invention can also provide a ■ production method of the above-mentioned synthetic intermediate. Since the above-mentioned synthetic intermediate can overcome the above-mentioned problems in the prior art during the production of an anti-HIV agent (compound), the production method of the synthetic intermediate also has a high value for  industrial application and is significant.<br>
Of the synthetic intermediates, compound (2') is stable by itself, and can tolerate severe conditions and/or long-term preservation.  Furthermore, when the quality of compound (2') can be controlled in the initial production stage, not only the  quality management in the later steps but also the quality<br><br>
management of an anti-HIV agent (compound) (e.g., compound (10) and the like) can be facilitated.  Therefore, compound (2')   is an extremely important intermediate compound. [0402]<br>
Moreover, the present invention uses highly circulative compound (1) as a starting material.  Thus, the production method of the present invention can produce an anti-HIV agent (compound) more economically, since stability of supply of the starting material can be improved.<br>

The organic layer was separated, and washed successively with water (60 ml), 5% sodium hydrogencarbonate (60 ml) and water (60 ml). The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure.  N,N-dimethylformamide (40 ml) was added to the residue, and the mixture was concentrated again under reduced pressure.  The residue was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (60 ml) to give a solution of 2- (5-(3-chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-2-fluoro-4-methoxybenzoyl)-3-((S)-l-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropylami.no) acrylic aC1d ethyl ester in N,N-dimethylformamide.  This was identified as the title compound by HPLC.<br>

methylpropylamino)acrylic aC1d ethyl ester prepared in Step IX or Step III in N,N-dimethylformamide was added anhydrous potassium carbonate (4.86 g) with stirring at room temperature. After stirring at 95 - 105°C for 6 hr, N,N-dimethylformamide (10 ml) and water (50 ml) were successively added dropwise at 65 -<br><br>
75°C to allow crystallization.  After stirring for 1 hr, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and further stirred for 1 hr.  Water (20 ml) was further added and, after stirring for 1 hr, the mixture was filtered, and the residue was washed successively with 50% aqueous N,N-dimethylformamide solution (20 ml) and water (20 ml), and vacuum dried to give 6-(3-chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-1- ( (S)-l-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropyl)-7-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline)-3-carboxylic aC1d ethyl ester (13.5 g)) •<br>

6- (3-Chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-1-((S)-l-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropyl)-7-methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydroquinoline)-3-carboxylic aC1d ethyl ester (5.0 g) was dissolved in ethanol (30 ml), and 1.5% V/W aqueous alkali solution prepared from 8N-aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (30 ml) and water (5.53 ml) was added dropwise with stirring at room temperature.  After stirring at 45 - 50°C for 30 min, the mixture was cooled, and 2N hydrochloric<br>
&gt;    aC1d (7.88 ml) was added dropwise with stirring at room<br>
temperature.  Then, a seed crystal was added, and the mixture was further stirred for 1 hr.  The mixture was filtered and the residue was washed with 60% ethanol (10 ml) and vacuum dried to give 6-(3-chloro-2-fluoropenzyl)-1-((S)-l-hydroxymethyl-2-<br>
5 methylpropyl)-7-methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydroquinoline)-3-carboxylic aC1d (4.23 g, yield 89.8%). [0718]<br><br>
This application is based on a patent application Nos. 2006-60277 and 2006-60298 filed in Japan, the contents of which are incorporated in full herein by this reference. [industrial Applicability] [0719]<br>
The compound (2') of the present invention is particularly useful as a synthetic intermediate for a compound having an extremely high HIV integrase inhibitory activity (see, for example, WO2004/046115).<br>
In addition, the present invention can provide a method of produC1ng a compound having an HIV integrase inhibitory activity in a good yield.<br>
Moreover, the production method of the present invention is useful as a method for industrial mass synthetic because the method does not use a highly dangerous and highly toxic reagent<br>
requiring careful handling and can be performed under mild	<br>
