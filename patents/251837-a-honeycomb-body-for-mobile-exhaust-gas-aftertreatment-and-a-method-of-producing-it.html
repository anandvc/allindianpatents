				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Production of, in particular large, honeycomb bodies<br>
for mobile exhaust-gas aftertreatment<br>
The present invention relates to a honeycomb body<br>
comprising a housing and a plurality of layers with a<br>
curved profile and a predetermined length, wherein the<br>
layers each comprise at least one at least partially<br>
structured metal foil, so as to form a multiplicity of<br>
passages with a passage cross section. The invention<br>
also proposes a process for producing a honeycomb body<br>
and a particular use of the honeycomb body. Honeycomb<br>
bodies of this type are used in particular for exhaust-<br>
gas aftertreatment in the automotive industry.<br>
Metallic honeycomb bodies of this type are preferably<br>
constructed using metal foils and used as support<br>
bodies for a catalytically active, adsorbing,<br>
oxidizing, reducing and/or further coating in exhaust<br>
systems of mobile internal combustion engines. On<br>
account of the extreme thermal and dynamic stresses<br>
which are present in such applications, it is<br>
particularly important to ensure a permanent connection<br>
between the individual metal foils and also between the<br>
metal foils and the housing. The metal foils are<br>
usually connected to one another and to the housing by<br>
a joining technique, in particular by sintering,<br>
brazing and/or welding. For this purpose, it is<br>
necessary for sufficient contact locations between the<br>
adjacent metal foils and between the metal foils and<br>
the housing to be present at the desired connection<br>
locations such that these contact locations can serve<br>
as a basis for the connection.<br>
To ensure stable connection of the metal foils to the<br>
housing, EP 0 245 737 B1 reveals that by shortening the<br>
corrugated sheet-metal layers by a predetermined<br>
distance compared to the smooth sheet-metal layers, it<br>
is possible to ensure that the ends of the sheet-metal<br>
layers touch and nestle against the tubular casing.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
This nestling action makes it easier to effect a secure<br>
connection to the tubular casing with various touching<br>
angles.<br>
WO 2005/033484 has disclosed a process for producing a<br>
metallic honeycomb body with a layer length difference,<br>
in which a plurality of smooth metal foils and at least<br>
partially structured metal foils are arranged in a<br>
housing, the smooth metal foils having a first length<br>
and the structured metal foils having a second length,<br>
and the difference between the first length and the<br>
second length being selected as a function of a<br>
prestress. In view of the fact that during the<br>
conventional production of honeycomb bodies of this<br>
type the structured metal foils are deformed if they<br>
are pressed into the housing under a considerable<br>
prestress, the production method proposed in<br>
WO 2005/033484 is supposed to nonetheless to ensure<br>
that the ends of the metal foils are in uniform<br>
contact.<br>
In particular in a configuration of honeycomb bodies in<br>
which the metal foils are not wound up helically or are<br>
only layered, however, zones of greater deformation and<br>
less successful formation of connections by joining<br>
techniques have occurred during production. This is<br>
attributable, for example, to the asymmetrical form of<br>
winding of the metal foils. However, in particular with<br>
a view to series production, there is a risk of<br>
unevenly configured honeycomb bodies which have regions<br>
with more or less strongly deformed passage cross<br>
sections. This, by way of example, also influences the<br>
flow properties of an exhaust gas flowing through a<br>
honeycomb body of this type, so that under certain<br>
circumstances it could be necessary to align the<br>
honeycomb body to the flow profile of the exhaust gas.<br>
Moreover, further difficulties have arisen in<br>
particular when producing large honeycomb bodies, for<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
example for stationary use or for trucks. In<br>
particular, the handling of large sets of metal foils<br>
and of the forces produced during winding have proven<br>
difficult to control in a reliable process. As the<br>
diameter increases, the effects of an asymmetry during<br>
winding and/or the forces which are required for<br>
winding also become considerably higher. If it is not<br>
possible to wind or twist the metal foils to form a<br>
body which substantially corresponds to the contour of<br>
the inner region of the housing, high forces have to be<br>
applied to force the body into the housing; under<br>
certain circumstances, on account of the housings<br>
having ever thinner walls, the housing itself may even<br>
be deformed, which can lead to problems with<br>
integration in an exhaust system.<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to reduce or resolve the problems which have<br>
been outlined in connection with the prior art. It is<br>
intended in particular to specify a honeycomb body<br>
which is distinguished by a particularly uniform<br>
configuration of the passage cross sections, with in<br>
particular defined connection points being realized<br>
between the individual metal foils or between the metal<br>
foils and the housing. Furthermore, it is intended to<br>
specify a process for producing a honeycomb body of<br>
this type, with which it is possible in particular to<br>
produce large honeycomb bodies with little force in a<br>
reliable process. It is preferentially also intended to<br>
specify how apparatuses for winding such large<br>
honeycomb bodies can be adapted in order to allow even<br>
series production of honeycomb bodies of a constant<br>
quality. Finally, it is also intended to specify uses<br>
for a honeycomb body of this type.<br>
These objects are achieved by the honeycomb body having<br>
the features of patent claim 1 and the process for<br>
producing a honeycomb body having the features of<br>
patent claim 6. Particularly preferred configurations<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
are given in the dependent patent claims. It should be<br>
noted that the features listed individually in the<br>
patent claims can be combined with one another in any<br>
technologically appropriate way so as to provide<br>
further configurations of the invention.<br>
The honeycomb body according to the invention comprises<br>
a housing and a plurality of layers with a curved<br>
profile and a predetermined length, which each comprise<br>
at least one at least partially structured metal foil,<br>
so as to form a multiplicity of passages with a passage<br>
cross section, in which the majority of the layers are<br>
designed with different lengths than one another.<br>
A "layer" is configured in such a way that it forms at<br>
least a series of passages. This can be achieved, for<br>
example, by stacking structured metal foils, one smooth<br>
and one structured metal foil, two smooth metal foils<br>
with one structured metal foil arranged between them.<br>
The structure of the metal foil, which is preferably<br>
formed over the entire length of a layer, is usually<br>
similar to a sine wave, but may also be of zig-zag<br>
and/or square-wave configuration. As a result of the<br>
metal foils bearing against one another and of the<br>
provision of the structure, passages are formed, which<br>
are generally delimited by at least two of the metal<br>
foils. As a result, a passage cross section of the<br>
passages is defined. The passage cross section in<br>
particular has a semicircle-like, bell-like,<br>
rectangular, omega-shaped or similar configuration. The<br>
configuration of the passage cross section is<br>
preferably identical over the entire length.<br>
The metal foil is preferably made from a high-<br>
temperature-resistant, corrosion-resistant material. In<br>
particular a steel material with high aluminum and<br>
chromium contents is suitable for this purpose. The<br>
metal foils are preferably designed with a thickness in<br>
the range of less than 0.15 mm, in particular in a<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
range from 0.02 mm to 0.12 mm. In principle, the metal<br>
foil can also be designed with openings, apertures or a<br>
microstructure (guide surfaces, studs, etc.)<br>
superimposed on the structure.<br>
It is now proposed that the majority of the layers be<br>
designed with different lengths than one another. This<br>
means first all that the honeycomb body is formed by at<br>
least two layers. It is preferable for the honeycomb<br>
body to include a plurality of layers numbering more<br>
than 5, 10 or even 20. The layers can be arranged in<br>
several groups and then intertwined, in which case all<br>
the layers of one group in each case follow a profile<br>
that is different from that of the further group(s). It<br>
is also possible for all the layers to be stacked on<br>
top of one another and thereby deformed to produce the<br>
honeycomb structure, so that substantially the same<br>
profile results for all the layers. In this case, it is<br>
possible to form different winding types or shapes of<br>
the profile of the layers, in particular a spiral<br>
shape, an S shape, a V shape or a W shape. The type of<br>
winding can be selected, for example, taking into<br>
account the configuration of the housing as well; in<br>
principle, any housing cross section can be used, in<br>
particular a round, oval, polygonal, triangular or<br>
similar housing cross section. A feature common to all<br>
these types of winding is that the layers are arranged<br>
with a curved profile, the layer preferably being<br>
completely curved, i.e. not having any flat sections.<br>
However, the curvature of the profile is irrelevant; by<br>
way of example, it is possible for different radii of<br>
curvature, concave and/or convex sections, turning<br>
locations, saddle locations or the like to be present.<br>
This curved profile and if appropriate also the cross-<br>
sectional shape of the housing now lead to different<br>
degrees of deformation of the layers, so that after the<br>
winding, intertwining and/or twisting they form an<br>
outer contour which, for the same length of layer, does<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
not correspond to the housing cross section. Therefore,<br>
the production process was hitherto configured in such<br>
a way that the layers had a length which was such that<br>
the entire housing cross section was reliably filled,<br>
with the projecting section of the layer being deformed<br>
during pressing into the housing.<br>
The invention for the first time deviates from this<br>
procedure, since it is proposed here that the layer<br>
length for each individual layer be selected in such a<br>
way that the ends of the layers, prior to insertion<br>
into the housing, form a contour which substantially<br>
corresponds to the housing cross section. In view of<br>
the fact that in this case a multiplicity of different<br>
housing cross sections can be considered, at least the<br>
majority of the layers are designed with layer lengths<br>
that are different from one another. It is particularly<br>
preferable for all the lengths of the layers arranged<br>
in the honeycomb body to be designed with a different<br>
length. A concept of this type has not hitherto been<br>
considered, since considerable difficulties were to be<br>
expected in the handling of the different layers and<br>
their positioning with respect to one another.<br>
However, it has now been discovered that in particular<br>
in the case of large honeycomb bodies which, for<br>
example, have a diameter of greater than 150 mm or even<br>
greater than 200 mm (as are used in particular in<br>
trucks as well as in stationary applications), the<br>
integration of the metal foils in a housing can be<br>
carried out in a reliable process and using relatively<br>
low forces, so that there is virtually no deformation<br>
to the structure comprising the metal foil, and<br>
therefore a very homogeneous honeycomb structure is<br>
formed. In addition to improved flow properties on the<br>
part of the exhaust gas passing through a honeycomb<br>
body of this type, this in particular also leads to a<br>
defined contact between the individual metal foils and<br>
between the metal foils and the housing, so that<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
connections by a joining technique can be formed in a<br>
reliable process and in a locally defined manner. This<br>
in turn leads to the thermal expansion properties of<br>
the metal foils with respect to one another and between<br>
metal foil and the housing, which are of importance in<br>
particular for large honeycomb bodies, being set<br>
deliberately and in a long-term manner.<br>
According to a further configuration of the honeycomb<br>
body, the passage cross section of at least 95% of the<br>
passages is identical. Very particularly preferably, at<br>
least 98% of all the passage cross sections are<br>
identical, and a special preference is given to a<br>
configuration in which all the passages which are<br>
completely delimited only by metal foils have the same<br>
passage cross section. This is made possible in<br>
particular on account of the different lengths of the<br>
layers, which are selected in such a way that the layer<br>
ends, without significant deformation, simply finish at<br>
the housing, in which case it is possible to dispense<br>
with the need for smooth end sections of the structured<br>
metal foils to ensure that they nestle against the<br>
housing, yet contact with the housing is nonetheless<br>
ensured. It should be noted by way of explanation at<br>
this point that the passage cross section can also be<br>
regarded as "identical" if standard manufacturing<br>
tolerances are present.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the majority of the<br>
metal foils are designed with different lengths than<br>
one another. This is to be understood as meaning in<br>
particular that the metal foils within a layer can also<br>
be designed to be of different lengths from one<br>
another. In this case the length of the layer results<br>
from the mean value of the lengths of the metal foils<br>
in one layer. In view of the fact that the layers have<br>
a height in the range of less than 10 mm and in<br>
particular less than 5 mm, with this configuration of<br>
the honeycomb body adaptation is effected even with<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
such slight differing curvatures of the adjacent metal<br>
foils.<br>
For certain applications, it may be advantageous for<br>
the housing to have at least one curved housing section<br>
and for at least some of the layers to end at this at<br>
least one curved housing section. This is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning that the layers<br>
butt against the curved housing section but<br>
predominantly do not nestle over a certain housing<br>
section (for example more than 10 mm or 6 mm) . The<br>
process of the ends of the layers nestling against the<br>
housing, which has been deployed hitherto, leads to<br>
increased consumption of material and greater<br>
deformation of the outer passages. As a result of the<br>
provision of different lengths of layers, it is<br>
possible for the layers to end directly at the housing<br>
even with this curved configuration.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if the layers form<br>
touching points with the housing, distances to adjacent<br>
touching points being designed to be unequal for at<br>
least some of the touching points. The uneven<br>
configuration of the distances between adjacent<br>
touching points is substantially also influenced by the<br>
winding type or the shape of the profile of the layers.<br>
This type of configuration of the touching points in<br>
particular leads to a homogeneous radial prestress and<br>
a reduction in the passage deformations in the edge<br>
region.<br>
Finally, the invention also proposes a honeycomb body<br>
in which the metal foils form contact locations with<br>
one another and with the housing, which contact<br>
locations together determine an overall contact region,<br>
with a cohesive connection being formed for at most 50%<br>
of the overall contact region. Preference is given to<br>
configurations in which at most only 3 0% or even only<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
at most 10% of the overall contact region is formed<br>
with cohesive connections.<br>
In particular in the case of the configuration of<br>
rectilinear passages running substantially parallel to<br>
one another, a multiplicity of virtually linear contact<br>
locations between the individual metal foils or between<br>
the metal foil and the housing are formed. These<br>
contact locations are fundamentally available for<br>
forming connections by a joining technique between the<br>
abovementioned components, with the overall set of<br>
these contact locations being referred to here as the<br>
"overall contact region". If the contact locations are,<br>
for example, substantially linear in form, the overall<br>
contact region results as the sum of the linear contact<br>
locations, so that ultimately it would be possible to<br>
specify an overall length. In addition, it should also<br>
be noted that the contact locations between the<br>
individual metal foils represent by far the majority,<br>
with the proportion formed by contact locations between<br>
the metal foils and the housing being, for example, in<br>
a range of less than 10%, in particular approximately<br>
5%.<br>
It is now proposed that at most 50% of this overall<br>
contact region is actually formed by a cohesive<br>
connection, while the remainder of the overall contact<br>
region is not used for this purpose, but rather the<br>
loose contact between the components allows sliding or<br>
different thermal expansion properties. The cohesive<br>
connection is preferably formed as a soldered<br>
connection generated by a brazing process. The<br>
arrangement of the cohesive connections with respect to<br>
the honeycomb body can be selected as desired taking<br>
into account the thermal stressing and the materials<br>
used for the honeycomb body. In particular, the<br>
cohesive connections can be provided independently of<br>
one another and in a locally defined manner in the<br>
radial, axial and any other desired direction of the<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
honeycomb body. By way of example, just an end-side<br>
attachment of all the contact locations over the first<br>
few millimeters (e.g. 6, 8 or 10 mm) is preferable over<br>
the entire cross section of the honeycomb body, for<br>
which purpose, preferably, a solder strip is placed<br>
between the individual layers and/or between the layers<br>
and the housing during production. In this way,<br>
depending on the size of the honeycomb body, it is even<br>
possible for less than 3 0% of the overall contact<br>
region actually to be formed by a cohesive connection.<br>
It is also possible for accurate application of solder<br>
to the desired contact locations to be carried out by<br>
means of printing methods (application in drop form,<br>
for example what is known as drop-on-demand, bubble-<br>
jet, continuous-jet processes). In which case in<br>
particular with processes of this type it is even<br>
possible for less than 10% of the overall contact<br>
region to be formed by a cohesive connection.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a process<br>
for producing a honeycomb body, comprising at least the<br>
following steps:<br>
a)	shaping a plurality of layers of a predetermined<br>
length, these layers in each case comprising at<br>
least one at least partially structured metal<br>
foil, so as to form a multiplicity of passages<br>
having a passage cross section, and the majority<br>
of the layers being designed with different<br>
lengths than one another;<br>
b)	stacking at least some of the plurality of layers<br>
on top of one another so as to form at least one<br>
stack;<br>
c)	deforming the at least one stack so as to produce<br>
a curved profile of the layers;<br>
d)	arranging the at least one stack in a housing.<br>
The process is suitable in particular for producing a<br>
honeycomb body as described above in accordance with<br>
the invention.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
With regard to step a) , it should be noted that the<br>
shaping of layers may encompass in particular the<br>
cutting of metal foils, the structuring of metal foils,<br>
the stacking of metal foils on top of one another, the<br>
aligning of metal foils with respect to one another,<br>
the temporary connection of metal foils (e.g. by a<br>
bonding agent or adhesive) and other operations. In<br>
particular, step a) forms at least one row of passages<br>
arranged next to one another, each passage<br>
preferentially being delimited partially by a<br>
structured metal foil and partially by a smooth metal<br>
foil.<br>
Then, in accordance with b) , at least some of the<br>
shaped layers are stacked on top of one another. The<br>
number of stacks can preferably always be selected in<br>
the range from 1 to 6.<br>
Next, in accordance with step c) , the stacks are<br>
deformed. This can, for example, also take place in a<br>
plurality of stages, so that, for example, first of all<br>
each stack is deformed, in particular bent or turned<br>
in, separately, then the stacks are positioned with<br>
respect to one another and jointly wound, intertwined,<br>
bent or deformed in a similar way. After step c) , the<br>
stacks or the layers contained therein are preferably<br>
formed with a curved profile over their entire length,<br>
in particular regions of different radii of curvature<br>
being present.<br>
Finally, in accordance with step d) , the stacks are<br>
arranged in a housing. Before and/or after the stack<br>
has been arranged in the housing, it is possible for<br>
additives to be applied in and/or on the honeycomb<br>
body, with the additives in particular comprising means<br>
for forming cohesive connections (such as in this case<br>
for example binders, bonding agents, bonding<br>
restrictors (e.g. wax, oil), solder, etc.).<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that step b) takes place in<br>
such a way that the plurality of layers of a stack are<br>
arranged offset with respect to one another. This<br>
means, for example, that adjacent layers may be<br>
designed not only with different lengths but may also<br>
be arranged offset with respect to one another, i.e. do<br>
not form one common terminating plane. The style and<br>
nature of the offset is in turn dependent on the<br>
configuration of the housing and the structures of the<br>
metal foils. Under certain circumstances, it may also<br>
be advantageous for even the metal foils within one<br>
layer to be arranged offset with respect to one<br>
another.<br>
It is also advantageous for the plurality of layers to<br>
be magnetically fixed at least during step a) or b). On<br>
account of the different lengths of the layers and/or<br>
of the offset realized between the individual layers,<br>
handling of the stacks or layers presents problems. It<br>
is now proposed that the layers or metal foils or<br>
stacks be held in defined positions with respect to one<br>
another by means of at least one magnet. This allows<br>
transporting and/or storage of the layers or stacks<br>
even without the use of a bonding agent, in which Case<br>
the handling units used for this purpose can be used<br>
for different layers and/or honeycomb bodies<br>
simultaneously. The layers can be fixed by magnetic<br>
grippers, magnetic underlays and the like.<br>
As has already been indicated, step c) can be carried<br>
out in at least two stages, in which case it is<br>
advantageous that at least one of the following actions<br>
is carried out:<br>
folding over the at least one stack;<br>
aligning a plurality of stacks with respect to one<br>
another;<br>
intertwining a plurality of stacks;<br>
deforming the at least one stack using a first<br>
tool as far as a first extent and deforming the at<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
least one stack further using at least one second<br>
tool.<br>
The implementation of the abovementioned actions is<br>
advantageous in particular in the case of honeycomb<br>
bodies which ultimately have a diameter of greater than<br>
150 mm, in particular greater than 200 mm. In the two-<br>
stage configuration of the winding process,<br>
particularly gentle production can be realized with<br>
only slight deformation of the passages and/or using<br>
relatively low forces.<br>
This is to be explained below for a honeycomb body<br>
which has been wound helically and is formed (albeit<br>
not necessarily) with a plurality of layers of<br>
different lengths. For this case, the following<br>
procedure could be advantageous:<br>
shaping a layer which comprises at least one at<br>
least partially structured metal foil, so as to<br>
form a multiplicity of passages,<br>
fixing the layer in an end region using a gripping<br>
unit;<br>
rotating the gripping unit, so that the layer<br>
arranges itself around the gripping unit and forms<br>
a honeycomb body of increasing diameter;<br>
determining that the honeycomb body has reached a<br>
first extent;<br>
activating means comprising at least one second<br>
tool or guide means or drive means;<br>
further placing the stack against the existing<br>
circumferential surface of the honeycomb body<br>
until it has reached the desired diameter.<br>
In this context, reference is made in particular to the<br>
supplementary explanations given in connection with<br>
Fig. 11. The reaching of the first extent can be<br>
determined on the basis of the rotational angle of the<br>
gripping unit and/or directly at the honeycomb body.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the process, step c) is used to form a cylindrical<br>
honeycomb structure with a diameter, the honeycomb<br>
structure having a change in diameter of at most 5%<br>
before and after being arranged in the housing. It is<br>
preferable for the change in diameter to be in a range<br>
of less than 2% (corresponding for example to a<br>
diameter deviation of less than 3 mm). This illustrates<br>
the accuracy with which a honeycomb structure having a<br>
predetermined outer contour can be formed by the<br>
process according to the invention, so that this outer<br>
contour is very close to the housing cross section.<br>
Making the contour of the honeycomb structure so close<br>
to the housing cross section allows all the edge<br>
regions (in the case of housings which are not round)<br>
to be filled uniformly while at the same time avoiding<br>
deformation of passages in the edge region.<br>
Nevertheless, reliable contact between the ends of the<br>
layers and the housing, for example to form connections<br>
by a joining technique, is ensured.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, a<br>
deformation of the honeycomb body over its<br>
circumference is carried out as step e) . This means in<br>
other words that after the stack has been arranged in<br>
the housing, a further, minor, plastic deformation of<br>
the honeycomb body is additionally carried out, known<br>
as "calibration". For this purpose, by way of example,<br>
radially inwardly directed pressure is exerted<br>
uniformly over the periphery of the housing, so that<br>
the housing is calibrated to a desired diameter or a<br>
predetermined roundness or other shape accuracy. At the<br>
same time, "relaxing" or "relieving" of the layers or<br>
metal foils in the interior can take place, so that<br>
once again reliable contact between the ends of the<br>
layers and the housing is ensured.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that, as step f) ,<br>
regionally delimited cohesive connections are produced<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
at least between the metal foils or at least between a<br>
metal foil and the housing, the regions being designed<br>
differently in various planes of the honeycomb body. It<br>
is preferable to produce cohesive connections both<br>
between the individual metal foils and to the housing.<br>
The term "regionally delimited connections" is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning that the honeycomb<br>
body has regions with cohesive connections and without<br>
cohesive connections to compensate for different<br>
thermal expansion properties. The regions may be large-<br>
area or large-volume parts of the honeycomb body, for<br>
example a star-shaped zone or a peripheral zone toward<br>
the housing, but it is equally possible for a region to<br>
be restricted to a certain number of passages, for<br>
example fewer than 10 passages arranged adjacent to one<br>
another. Regionally delimited cohesive connections may<br>
also be present in the direction of a passage, so that<br>
the metal foils forming the passage are not cohesively<br>
connected to one another over the entire length of the<br>
passage. Once again, it is preferable to use a<br>
configuration of the honeycomb body in which, for<br>
example, at most 10% of the overall contact region has<br>
a cohesive connection, in particular only at most 5%.<br>
The cohesive connections are formed differently in<br>
different planes. The planes may be considered both in<br>
the direction of the passages and transversely with<br>
respect thereto. In principle, there may also be planes<br>
in which no cohesive connections are arranged.<br>
Preference is given to a honeycomb body as described<br>
above in accordance with the invention or a honeycomb<br>
body which has been produced by the process described<br>
in accordance with the invention being used in<br>
combination with an exhaust system of an automobile.<br>
Very and particularly preferably, the invention<br>
proposes a use for exhaust systems of trucks, in which<br>
case the honeycomb body has a diameter of greater than<br>
150 mm.<br><br>

Fig. 11 shows an apparatus for the two-stage winding of<br>
a honeycomb body; and<br>
Fig. 12 shows an exhaust system with a honeycomb body.<br>
Figs. 1 to 4 illustrate a process for producing a<br>
honeycomb body; Fig. 1 shows the shaping of layers,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the transporting of the layer to a stack,<br>
which is then built up in accordance with Fig. 3, and<br>
finally Fig. 4 illustrates the arrangement of two<br>
stacks with a curved profile within a housing.<br>
The apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises a smooth-<br>
strip delivery mechanism 26, in which a smooth metal<br>
foil 6 is rolled up for example on a coiler. The smooth<br>
strip delivery mechanism 26 delivers a smooth metal<br>
foil 6 on the one hand to a corrugated strip<br>
installation 27, in which a structured metal foil 6 is<br>
produced from the smooth metal foil 6 (for example by<br>
corrugation rolling). Since to produce a layer 3 in the<br>
example illustrated one structured metal foil 6 and one<br>
smooth metal foil 6 are combined with one another, the<br>
smooth strip delivery mechanism 26 delivers the smooth<br>
metal foil 6 via a conveyor belt 28 which is designed<br>
with a magnet 29 to fix the smooth metal foil 6 in<br>
place. The two metal foils 6 are arranged on top of one<br>
another and together are fed to a cutting apparatus 47<br>
which forms layers 3 of the desired length from the<br>
endless metal foils 6.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, the layer 3 formed in<br>
this way, comprising a fully structured metal foil 6<br>
and a fully smooth metal foil 6, is now arranged, by<br>
means of a gripper 3 0 which preferably likewise has<br>
means for magnetically fixing the layer 3 in place, so<br>
as to form a stack 15. A plurality of layers 3 (at<br>
least in some cases having different lengths 5 than one<br>
another) are now stacked individually on top of one<br>
another, with an offset 31 between the layers 3<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
positioned adjacent to one another additionally being<br>
realized. In the variant embodiment illustrated, seven<br>
(7) layers 3 are combined to form a stack 15.<br>
Two of the stacks 15 are then first of all separately<br>
turned over, so that two ends of the layers 3 are<br>
positioned on one side. Then, the two stacks 15 are<br>
intertwined and introduced into the housing 2<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4, so as to form the desired<br>
honeycomb body 1. In this way, the honeycomb body 1<br>
comprises the housing 2 and the honeycomb structure 19<br>
formed by the layers 3, the layers 3 being arranged<br>
with a curved profile 4 therein. The ends of the layers<br>
3 butt directly against the housing 2 over the<br>
circumference 21, in particular including the curved<br>
housing section 9. The touching points 10 of the layers<br>
3 in the region of the housing section 2 are preferably<br>
suitable for the production of connections by a joining<br>
technique between the layers 3 and the housing 2. To<br>
illustrate the honeycomb structure 19, Fig. 4 also<br>
partially illustrates the structure with passages 7.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an exemplary embodiment for the different<br>
lengths 5 of the layers 3 of a honeycomb body 1, which<br>
is configured with an S-shaped profile 4 of the layers<br>
3, as in Fig. 4. The length 5 of the layers 3 is<br>
plotted on the ordinate, and the number of layers 3 of<br>
a stack 15 is plotted on the abscissa. It can be seen<br>
from the illustration that no layer 3 has two adjacent<br>
layers 3 of the same length 5 as itself, and in<br>
particular none of the adjacent layers 3 have the same<br>
length 5 as a specific layer 3. It can also be seen<br>
that more than 20 mm, 50 mm or even 100 mm can lie<br>
between the maximum length 5 and the minimum length 5<br>
of a layer 3 within a stack 15. If the stack 15<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 is now wound in an S-shape,<br>
touching points 10 are formed at the housing 2, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6. It is noticeable here that the<br>
touching points 10 are not formed at a constant<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
distance 11 from one another, but rather at a varying<br>
distance 11 from one another.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates, by way of example, a shaping error<br>
which has occurred in the known production method. In<br>
the left-hand illustration in Fig. 7, a stack 15<br>
comprising a plurality of layers 3 is used, the layers<br>
3 being designed of uniform length 5. After the winding<br>
operation, however, the result is a honeycomb structure<br>
19 which has an oval contour. Should it be desired to<br>
introduce this honeycomb structure 19 into a<br>
cylindrical housing 2, particular forces have to act on<br>
the projecting deformation regions 32, with the<br>
passages formed there being deformed. This is avoided<br>
by the process according to the invention and the<br>
honeycomb body according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a variant embodiment of a production<br>
line for layers 3 of a predetermined length 5 which<br>
each comprise at least one at least partially<br>
structured metal foil 6. In this case, a corrugated<br>
strip 34 is produced by means of a corrugated strip<br>
installation 27 and transported simultaneously with a<br>
smooth strip 33, which is being transported in the<br>
direction of advance 37 by means of a conveyor belt 28,<br>
to a cutting apparatus 47. The cutting apparatus 47<br>
severs layers 3 from the corrugated strip 34 and smooth<br>
strip 33 simultaneously, and these layers are then<br>
connected in an intermediate tray 35. The cut layer 3<br>
is transferred from the intermediate tray 35 to the<br>
stacking tray 36 by means of a gripper 30, which can<br>
move in different directions and can if appropriate<br>
also rotate; this transfer can be performed with the<br>
desired alignment with respect to the adjacent layer 3,<br>
for example with a specific offset. The stack 15 formed<br>
in this way can finally be transferred by the gripper<br>
3 0 to a further processing station, the gripper 3 0<br>
preferably being designed with means for magnetically<br>
fixing the layers 3 in place.<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
Fig. 9 shows a detail of a honeycomb body 1 which<br>
comprises a multiplicity of layers 3 arranged in a<br>
housing 2. The layers 3 are each formed by one smooth<br>
and one corrugated metal foil 6, so as to form passages<br>
7 with a predetermined passage cross section 8. The<br>
passage cross section 8 of all the passages 7 which are<br>
formed entirely by metal foils 6 are substantially<br>
identical.<br>
It can also be seen from Fig. 9 that there are regions<br>
comprising connections 14. In the variant embodiment of<br>
the honeycomb body 1 illustrated, all the corrugated<br>
metal foils 6 are designed with a connection 14, which<br>
is a brazed connection, at the contact locations 12<br>
with the housing 2. Although Fig. 9 does not show any<br>
connections 14 with regard to the contact locations 12<br>
between the smooth metal foils 6 and the housing 2,<br>
these contact locations 12 may nevertheless at least in<br>
some cases be designed with a similar connection 14.<br>
Regionally delimited connections 14 are also provided<br>
in contact locations 12 between the metal foils 6 in<br>
the interior of the honeycomb structure 19. It can be<br>
seen that different layers 3 are designed with<br>
different numbers of connections 14, which may be based<br>
on regular intervals or may be variable. This regional<br>
formation of connections 14 by a joining technique<br>
enables the honeycomb body 1 to expand and contract<br>
relatively freely as a result of fluctuating thermal<br>
stresses, both in the direction of the profile of the<br>
passages and in the direction of the profile of the<br>
layers 3, both axially and radially with respect to the<br>
honeycomb body 1.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a somewhat greater regional extent<br>
of connections 14 formed by a joining technique. In the<br>
zone of an end side 48, the honeycomb body 1<br>
illustrated has a first region 22 comprising<br>
connections 14, this region 22 being arranged<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
substantially in the vicinity of the housing 2 and<br>
widening radially inward in a sub-zone. This end-side<br>
region 22, however, does not extend over the entire<br>
depth of the honeycomb body 1 in the direction of the<br>
axis 49, but rather only over part of this depth. In<br>
addition, further regions 22 with connections 14 are<br>
formed in inner zones of the honeycomb body 1. In the<br>
illustration presented in Fig. 10, two planes 23<br>
perpendicular to the axis 49 are indicated, the regions<br>
22 being formed differently in the planes 23 of the<br>
honeycomb body 1 illustrated.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an apparatus for helical winding up at<br>
least one layer 3 to form a honeycomb body 1. The layer<br>
3 is guided from a layer reservoir 41 to a mandrel 44,<br>
which fixes one end of the layer 3. The mandrel 44 is<br>
part of a first tool 16 which allows a rotation 43 of<br>
the mandrel 44 about its own axis. In a first stage of<br>
the winding process, the layer reservoir 41 is in a<br>
fixed position and the honeycomb body 1 is formed<br>
exclusively on the basis of the rotation 43 of the<br>
mandrel 44. When a predetermined extent 17, for example<br>
an extent 17 in the region of 50 mm, is reached, a<br>
second tool 18 is switched on in order to build up the<br>
honeycomb body 1 further until it reaches its<br>
ultimately desired diameter 20.<br>
Fig. 11 shows two (2) further second tools 18, which<br>
can be used individually in combination, on their own<br>
or to assist the first tool 16. The second tool 18<br>
explained above comprises a ram 39 which is brought<br>
into engagement or contact with one of the end sides 48<br>
of the honeycomb structure 19, for example by a lifting<br>
movement 40. This second tool 18 is preferably designed<br>
with a drive 38, so that the ram 39 can rotate<br>
synchronously with the mandrel 44. In this way, the<br>
forces required for rotation of the honeycomb structure<br>
are distributed between a plurality of drives 3 8 or<br>
over a larger area of the end side(s) 48 of the<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
honeycomb structure 19, so that even as the extent 17<br>
becomes greater a uniform arrangement of the layer 3<br>
around the honeycomb structure 19 which has already<br>
been formed is ensured. The ram 39 may also be provided<br>
as part of the base or in the circumferential region of<br>
the mandrel 44. Furthermore, it is also possible for<br>
the ram 39 to be designed with a plurality of recesses<br>
which, for example, engage in the passages 7 of the<br>
honeycomb structure 19 which has already been formed.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to use means with an<br>
equivalent action, such as further pins, magnetic<br>
plates, etc., for a large-volume force introduction<br>
space.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to use the layer<br>
reservoir 41 itself to form a second tool 18. In this<br>
case, the layer reservoir 41 can change its position<br>
relative to the honeycomb structure 19 formed, in<br>
particular can circulate around it, in which case the<br>
radius toward the mandrel 44 can be varied. It is in<br>
this way possible to describe a path 42 in which the<br>
layer reservoir 41 (similarly to a spiral) runs around<br>
the honeycomb structure 19 at an increasing distance<br>
and thus brings the layer 3 into contact. This second<br>
tool 18 may also be designed with a drive 38 in order<br>
to execute this path 42 and/or to realize rotation of<br>
the layer reservoir 41 itself.<br>
It is preferable for the first and second tools 16 and<br>
18 to operate in a controlled way which is suitably<br>
adapted to one another. In addition, it is possible to<br>
provide means for determining the current extent 17,<br>
the positioning of the ram 39 and/or the production of<br>
relative movements of the second tools 18 with respect<br>
to the first tool 16.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates the preferred use of a honeycomb<br>
body 1 described here. The figure illustrates an<br>
automobile 25 in the form of a truck with an internal<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
combustion engine which is designed as a diesel engine<br>
45. The exhaust gases produced in the engine 45 are fed<br>
via an exhaust system 24, in the direction of flow 46,<br>
to a plurality of honeycomb bodies 1 of different<br>
functions before the purified exhaust gases are<br>
ultimately released to atmosphere. In automobiles 25 of<br>
this type, in particular honeycomb bodies 1 with a<br>
diameter of greater than 150 mm are used. The honeycomb<br>
bodies 1 described here and processes for producing<br>
them are especially suitable in particular for these<br>
honeycomb bodies 1.<br><br>
