BLUE AND RED BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2005/003277                                                                                                        PCT/EP2004/006242 <br><br>
BLUE AND RED BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to the photo-bleaching of    products, in particular laundry bleaching.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In a conventional bleaching treatment, a substrate such as a laundry fabric or other textile is subjected to hydrogen    peroxide, or to substances which can generate hydroperoxyl radicals, such as inorganic or organic peroxides.<br>
A preferred approach to generating hydroperoxyl bleach radicals is the use of inorganic peroxides coupled with<br>
    organic precursor compounds.  These systems are employed for many commercial laundry powders.  For example, various European systems are based on tetraacetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate, whereas in the United<br>
    States laundry bleach products are typically based on sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (SNOBS) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate.  Alternatively, or additionally, hydrogen peroxide and peroxy systems can be activated by bleach catalysts, such as by complexes of iron<br>
     and the ligand N4Py (i.e. N, N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-bis(pyridin-2-yl)methylamine) disclosed in W095/34628.<br>
Another approach to bleaching is that of using radical photo-initiators, which are generally organic chemicals    which on absorption of light, particularly UV light, form reactive radicals. They are widely used to initiate the<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
polymerisation of alkenes and thereby cure coatings. They<br>
may also be used as photobleach agents as discussed in GB<br>
9917451. Radical photoinitiators, in general, are discussed  <br>
by H.F. Gruber in Prog.   Polym.   Sci.   Vol  2 7. 953-1044. <br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We have found that the treatment of a stained textile with a bleaching composition comprising a photo-reactive red dye having a lambda max in the visible in the range 500 to 550-<br>
     nm together with a blue dye having a lambda max in the<br>
visible in the range 580 to 640 nm yields a bleached textile with enhanced whiteness. The bleaching activity is particularly good against catechol-type stains, polyphenolics-type stains and polycyclic hydroxylated<br>
     aromatic-type stains.<br>
These catechol-type stains, polyphenolics-type stains and polycyclic hydroxylated aromatic-type stains are as a result of the chromophores found in tea, coffee, blackberry,<br>
     blueberry, blackcurrant, red wine, banana and the like.<br>
These stains are. characteristic and distinct from oily food type stains such as tomato oil stain, curry oil stain, mango stain, annatto derived stain, colorau derived stain, and sebum derived stain etc.<br><br>
The present invention provides a bleaching composition comprising: a) from 0.0001 to 0.1 wt/wt% of a photo-reactive red dye having a peak in the visible in the range 500 to 550 nm; b) from 0.0001 wt/wt% to 0.1 wt/wt of a blue dye lambda<br>
    max 580-640 nm; c) from 0 to 40 wt/wt% other bleaching species; and, d) the Balance carriers and adjunct<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
ingredients to 100 wt/wt % of the total bleaching composition.<br>
It is most preferred that upon addition of a unit dose of    the bleaching composition to an aqueous environment a wash liquor having a pH in the range 8 to 11 is provided.<br>
The bleaching composition may be used on its own or in conjunction with other bleaching species. It is preferred<br>
    that those other bleaching species, if used, possess different bleaching profiles to the solely the photo-reactive red dye bleaching composition.  The stain bleaching profile of known photo-bleaches such as radical photoinitiators,_ is generally that of ceretenoid type<br>
    'stains, for example tomato stains which is similar to the bleaching profile of "air" bleaching catalysts.<br>
Of the photo-reactive red dyes Xanthene type dyes are preferred, particularly based on the structure: 20<br><br>
where the dye may be substituted by halogens and other elements/groups. Particularly preferred examples are Food red 14 and Rose Bengal, Phloxin B, Eosin Y.  The fact that 25  these dyes are brightly red makes their application in<br>
textile bleaching unusual because on-e would expect, their use to result in discoloured rather than whitened textiles. When Food red 14 is used solely as the bleaching species the<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
consumer is reassured in the laundry context that the bleach used is mild because of that fact that it is an acceptable food additive. Food dyes are used to enhance the visual appearance of many foods. As humans consume them, they    undergo rigorous testing and examination to ensure they represent no risk to health.<br>
The present invention also extends to a method of photo-bleaching a textile.  <br><br>
The light used for photo-bleaching may be sunlight, florescent light or that from an ordinary light bulb.<br>
Photo-bleaching is still effective where "the concentration    of the photo-reactive red dye on the textile/cloth is so low as to be barely perceptible to the human eye.  It is preferred that the dye rapidly photo-fades on irradiation with light.<br>
    The present invention may be applied locally, suitable pre-treatment means for application include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks.<br>
A unit dose as used herein is a particular amount of the    bleaching composition used for a type of wash.  The unit dose may be in the form of a defined volume of powder, granules or tablet.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
A photo-reactive dye is one which on exposure to light in-the wavelength range 300-700nm, more preferably 400 to 700<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
nm, undergoes photochemical process to produce reactive/excited species that is capable of bleaching coloured stained material, such as tea stains. The photo-reaction should be able to occur in minutes to hours under  normal lighting conditions (40-400 W m-2 in the 400 to 700 nm range).<br>
A photo-reactive red dye is one having a lambda .max in the visible in the range 500 to 550 nm, for example, Food red    14, Rose Bengal, Phloxine B, and Eosin Y.<br>
A blue dye is one having a lambda max in the visible in the range 580 to 640 nm and may be direct or acid blue dyes such as listed by the Society of Dyers and Colourists and<br>
     American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists  (see http://www.colour-index.org). Direct and acid dyes may be selected from azo, bis-azo, anthraquinone, triarylmethane dyes. Preferred dyes are clearly those that deposit on cotton. Preferred direct and acid dyes are those that<br>
    deposit on cotton but do not build up on cotton over<br>
multiple washes, examples of dyes that do not build up are acid black 1, acid blue 29, acid blue 113, and acid black 24. Particularly preferred are dyes, which deposit on cotton but do not deposit on nylon, such as acid black 1 and acid<br>
    blue 29.  The blue dye also serves to mask any residual red colour, the combination or red and blue providing a violet colour that enhances the whiteness of the fabric.<br>
The preferred photo-reactive red dye is Food red 14     (Erythrosine B) (E 127; CI number 45430) (CAS 16423-68-0) which is a widely used red food colouring, see Hunger K.<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
Industrial Dyes: Chemistry Properties And Applications. Wiley-VCH, Heidelberg 2003.<br>
The concentration of the photo-reactive red dye -in a wash    liquor is from 5ppb to l000ppm, preferably l0ppb to l00ppm, more preferably 50ppb to 5ppm, and most preferably l00ppb to lppm.  A same concentration may also be used for a spot treatment of a stain or of a commercial liquid formulation. A suitable concentration in a powder detergent would be 10  0.0001 wt/wt% to 0.1 wt/wt%, most preferred is 0.001 wt/wt% to 0.01 wt/wt%.<br>
A dye in the context of the current invention is described as an organic compound with an optical absorption maximum in    the visible wavelength range of 400-700nm, such that the extinction coefficient at the maximum in the visible is greater than 5000 mol/l/cm, most preferably grater than 10000 mol/l/cm.<br>
    The use of a blue dye to give shading is described in copending GB application 0314211.4 filed on 18/6/2003.  In this manner, yellowing of whites may be reduced and an aesthetically pleasing blue hue given to the wash liquor. It is preferred that the red dye:blue dye is in the ratio 9:1<br>
     to 1:9.<br>
The concentration of the blue dye in a wash liquor is from 5ppb to l000ppm, preferably l0ppb to l00ppm, more preferably 50ppb to 5ppm, and most preferably l00ppb to lppm.  A same    concentration may also be used for a spot treatment of a stain or of a commercial liquid formulation.  A suitable<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
concentration in a powder detergent would be 0.0001 wt/wt%<br>
to 0.1 wt/wt%, most preferred is 0.001 wt/wt% to 0.01<br>
wt/wt%. &gt;&gt;<br>
   Of the blue dyes cotton substantive dyes are preferred over cotton non-substantive dyes.  In this regards, a cotton substantive dye is defined as in co-pending GB application 0314211.4.<br>
     Other Bleaching Species<br>
The bleaching composition may also contain other bleaching components, for example other photo-bleaches, a transition metal catalyst which is present in a bleaching composition that is substantially devoid of peroxyl species, and peroxyl<br>
     bleaching systems.  An example of a preferred additional photo-bleach is vitamin K3.<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been developed over recent years and may be used in the present<br>
    invention.  Examples of transition metal catalysts that may be used are found, for example, in: WO0060045, WO0248310, WO0029537 and WO0012667. The catalysts may be used for catalysing peroxyl or "air" bleaching as described in WO0248301.  The catalyst may alternatively be provided as<br>
    the free ligand that forms a complex in situ.<br>
The bleaching composition when use as an "air" bleaching composition is substantially devoid of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system. It is    believed that adventitious hydroperoxides within an oily<br>
stain serve to bleach the stain together with the catalyst.<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
The term "substantially devoid of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system" should be construed within spirit of the invention.  It is preferred that the composition has as low a content of peroxyl species    present as possible. It is preferred that the bleaching<br>
formulation contains less that 1 % wt/wt total concentration of peracid or hydrogen peroxide or source thereof, preferably the bleaching formulation contains less that 0.3 % wt/wt total concentration of peracid or hydrogen peroxide    or source thereof, most preferably the bleaching composition is devoid of peracid or hydrogen peroxide or source thereof.<br>
In contrast to air bleaching a peroxyl species is required. The peroxy bleaching species may be a compound, which is<br>
     capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art.  They include the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates persilicates<br>
    and persulphates.  Mixtures of two or more such compounds may also be suitable.<br>
Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate.  Sodium<br>
     perborate monohydrate is preferred because of its high active oxygen content.  Sodium percarbonate may also be preferred for environmental reasons.  The amount thereof in the composition of the invention usually will be within the range of about 1-35% by weight, preferably from 5-25% by<br>
    weight.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that these<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br><br>
amounts may be reduced in the presence of a bleach precursor e.g., N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED).<br>
Another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1-C4 alkanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol.  Such combinations are disclosed in International Application PCT/EP 94/03003 (Unilever), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alkylhydroxy peroxides are another class of peroxy bleaching compounds.  Examples of these materials include cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl "hydroperoxide.<br><br>
    Organic peroxyacids may also be suitable as the peroxy bleaching compound.  Such materials normally have the general formula:<br>
O O   l!     Y H    O   ^FT<br>
     wherein R is an alkylene or substituted alkylene group containing from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, optionally having an internal amide linkage; or a phenylene or substituted phenylene group; and Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, aryl, an imido-aromatic or non-aromatic group, a COOH<br>
     or<br><br><br><br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
group or a quaternary ammonium group.<br>
Typical monoperoxy acids useful herein include, for example:<br>
   (i) peroxybenzoic acid and ring-substituted peroxybenzoic acids, e.g. peroxy-alpha-naphthoic acid;<br>
(ii) aliphatic, substituted aliphatic and arylalkyl monoperoxyacids, e.g., peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic acid    and N,N-phthaloylaminoperoxy caproic acid (PAP); and<br>
(iii) 6-octylamino-6-oxo-peroxyhexanoic acid.<br>
Typical diperoxyacids useful herein include, for example:  <br><br>
(iv) 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDA);<br>
(v) 1, 9-diperoxyazelaic acid;<br>
    (vi) diperoxybrassilic acid; diperoxysebasic acid and diperoxyisophthalic acid;<br>
(vii) 2-decyldiperoxybutane-l,4-diotic acid; and<br>
    (viii) 4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid.<br>
Also inorganic peroxyacid compounds are suitable, such as for example potassium monopersulphate (MPS).  If organic or inorganic peroxyacids are used as the peroxygen compound, 30  the amount thereof will normally be within the range of about 2-10% by weight, preferably from 4-8%- by weight.<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
Peroxyacid bleach precursors are known and amply described in literature, such as in the British Patents 836988; 864,798; 907,356; 1,003,310 and 1,519,351; German Patent "3,337,921; EP-A-0185522; EP-A-0174132; EP-A-0120591; and    U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,246,339; 3,332,882; 4,128,494; 4,412,934 and 4,675,393.<br>
Another useful class of peroxyacid bleach precursors is that of the cationic i.e. quaternary ammonium substituted   peroxyacid precursors as disclosed in US Pat. Nos. 4,751,015 and 4,397,757, in EP-A0284292 and EP-A-331,229. Examples of peroxyacid bleach precursors of this class are:<br>
2-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) ethyl sodium-4-sulphonphenyl    carbonate chloride (SPCC);<br>
N-octyl-N,N-dimethyl-N10-carbophenoxy decyl ammonium chloride (ODC);<br>
     3-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) propyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carboxylate; and<br>
N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy benzene sulphonate.<br>
     A further special class of bleach precursors is formed by the cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520 and in European Patent Specification No.'s 458,396 and 464,880.<br>
Any one of these peroxyacid bleach precursors can be used in    the present invention, though some may be more preferred than others.<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
Of the above classes of bleach precursors, the preferred classes are the esters, including acyl phenol sulphonates and acyl alkyl phenol sulphonates; the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors    including the cationic nitriles.<br>
Examples of said preferred peroxyacid bleach precursors or activators are sodium-4-benzoyloxy benzene sulphonate (SBOBS); N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED);<br>
     sodium-l-methyl-2-benzoyloxy benzene-4-sulphonate; sodium-4-methyl-3-benzoloxy benzoate; SPCC; trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy-benzene sulphonate; sodium nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS); sodium 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoyl-oxybenzene sulphonate (STHOBS); and the substituted cationic<br>
     nitriles.<br>
Other classes of bleach precursors for use with the present invention are found in WO0015750, for example 6-(nonanamidocaproyl)oxybenzene sulphonate.  <br>
The precursors may be used in an amount of up to 12%, preferably from 2-10% by weight, of the composition.<br>
Balance Carriers and Adjunct Ingredients   <br>
The following provides examples of suitable balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.<br>
These are generally surfactants, builders, foam agents, anti-foam agents, solvents, and enzymes.  The use and    amounts of these components are such that the bleaching<br>
composition performs depending upon economics, environmental<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br>
-   13  -<br>
factors and use of the bleaching composition.  It is preferred that the bleaching composition comprises from 5 to 40 wt/wt % of a surfactant having an HLB greater than 15.<br>
   To that extent, the composition comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients. The invention in its second aspect provides an enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 - 50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or<br>
    more surfactants. This surfactant system may in turn comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and 5 to 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds, but this in<br>
    not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost. The enzymatic detergent composition according to the invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%.<br>
    In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. -1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon's<br>
    Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing. Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981. Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used, include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds<br>
    having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols<br><br>
WO 2005/003277<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006242<br><br><br>
with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide   per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic Cs-Cis primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are<br>
    usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic<br>
sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds<br>

    Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A 1.5g/L"stock solution of a base washing powder was    created. The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73% salts<br>
(silicate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including perborate, fluoreser and enzymes, remainder impurities and water. The solution was divided into 4, 200ml aliquots. To each was added various amounts of the food red    14, and then 2 BC1 test clothes and 4 white cotton clothes. All clothes were the same size and weight, the total weight of cloth added was 5g. BC1 is a standard stained test cloth used in laundry evaluation and is a model tea stain monitor. BC1 clothes may be purchased from e.g., the center for test    materials, Vlaardingen, NL.<br>
The clothes were then agitated in solution for 20 mins, removed rinsed and the 2 BCl clothes and 2 of the white clothes irradiated in a weatherometer (WOM) for 30 minutes.  A WCM produces artificial sunlight and was set up to give<br><br>

   Clear photo-bleaching of the BCl stain is observed. A small amount of red colouration is transferred to the white cloth. This red colouration is removed by exposure to sunlight.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
A lg/L SDS surfactant stock solution in water was created. The solution was divided in two and the two halves, and buffered to pH 10 and pH 8 respectively using standard salts (Hydrion ™ buffer, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). The<br>
   solution was used to wash BCl stains as follows. A 3.7g<br>
piece of BCl stained cotton cloth plus a 0.7g piece of clean white woven cotton cloth were agitated in 100ml of wash solution for 20 mins, rinsed twice, then the BCl cloth irradiated in a WOM for thirty minutes. The AE of the<br>
   clothes relative to a clean standard was then measured. The<br><br>

Photobleaching of the BCl stain was observed from all solution containing food red 14. Notably this occurs even at extremely low levels of the dye, O.lppm, at this level the dye is barely visible in solution and no red colour could be   discerned by eye on the white cloth. However the BCl cloth was visibly bleached. The red colour on the white cloth was removed simply by leaving in natural light.<br>

A solution of 0.2g/L SDS surfactant was created in pH=10    buffer (Hydrion ™) . The solution was divided in 2 and<br>
RoseBengal added to one half such that its Optical density at the maximum absorption of the dye in the visible was 0.81 (5cm). A similar solution was created for Food Red 14 but with a higher optical density of 0.93. The Solution of Food   Red 14 under indoor lighting was much paler to the eye than that of Rose Bengal. This was confirmed by 12 independent adults aged in the range 25-60 years. All stated the Rose Bengal solution to have a more intense colour, despite the fact it had a lower optical density.
