Organometallic transition metal compound, biscyclopentaclienyl ligand system, catalyst system and preparation of polyolefins<br>
The present invention relates to organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
where<br>
M1	is an element of group 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Periodic Table of the Elements or the<br>
lanthanides,<br>
the radicals X are identical or different and are each an organic or inorganic radical, with two radicals X also being able to be joined to one another,<br>
n	is a natural number from 1 to 4,<br>
Z	is a divalent organic group which has from 1 to 40 carbon atoms and together with<br>
the two carbon atoms of the indenyl system forms a saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted ring system having a ring size of from 4 to 12 atoms, where Z within the ring system fused to the indenyl system may also contain one or more, identical or different heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of Si, Ge, N, P, O, S, Se and Te,<br>
R1	is hydrogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
R2	is hydrogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
R3	is hydrogen, halogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br><br>
R	is hydrogen, halogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
R	is hydrogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
R6	is hydrogen or an organic radical having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
R , R	are identical or different and are each hydrogen or an organic radical having from 1<br>
to 40 carbon atoms or R7 and R8 together with the atoms connecting them form a monocyclic or polycyclic, substituted or unsubstituted ring system which has from 1 to 40 carbon atoms and may also contain heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of the elements Si, Ge, N, P, O, S, Se and Te,<br>
A	is a bridge consisting of a divalent atom or a divalent group,<br>
and<br>
if R3 is hydrogen, then R5 is an organic radical which has from 3 to 20 carbon atoms and is branched in the a position and R6 is hydrogen.<br>
The present invention further relates to biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems having such a substitution pattern, catalyst systems comprising at least one of the organometallic transition metal compounds of the present invention, a process for preparing polyolefins by polymerization or copolymerization of at least one olefin in the presence of one of the catalyst systems of the present invention, the use of the biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems of the present invention for preparing organometallic transition metal compounds and a process for preparing organometallic transition metal compounds using the biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems.<br>
Research and development on the use of organometallic transition metal compounds, in particular metallocenes, as catalyst components for the polymerization and copolymerization of olefins with the objective of preparing tailored polyolefins has been pursued intensively in universities and in industry over the past 15 years. Now both ethylene-based polyolefins prepared by means of metallocene catalyst systems and, in particular, propylene-based polyolefins prepared by means of metallocene catalyst systems represent a dynamically growing market segment.<br>
The preparation of propylene-ethylene copolymers which are used, for example, as rubber phase in the preparation of impact-modified propylene polymers has usually suffered from the problem that the molar masses of the propylene-ethylene copolymers which can be achieved using the known metallocene catalysts are significantly less than the molar masses of isotactic propylene homopolymers.<br><br>
EP-A-776913 describes the preparation of high molecular weight propylene-ethylene copolymers using specifically substituted C2-symmetric bisindenyl metallocenes.<br>
EP-A-834519 describes catalyst systems comprising C1-symmetric bisindenyl metallocenes which are suitable for the homopolymerization of propylene and produce propylene homopolymers having high melting points.<br>
WO 01/48034 describes catalyst systems which, owing to specifically substituted metallocenes, are able to produce both propylene-ethylene copolymers as rubber phase having a satisfactory molar mass and also propylene homopolymers having a sufficiently high melting point for satisfactorily high stiffness of the matrix. WO 03/045551 describes catalyst systems which have a further-improved property profile in respect of the above-described requirements.<br>
Despite the progress which has been achieved hitherto, there continues to be a need to find new metallocene catalyst systems which can achieve an improvement in the combination of high molar mass of the rubber phase and stiffness of the matrix. A further aspect is the economical accessibility of the catalyst components.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to find organometallic transition metal compounds which, when used as catalyst constituents, are able to achieve a further increase in the molar mass of propylene-ethylene copolymers resulting from the polymerization compared to the known metallocenes and at the same time are able to increase or at least maintain the desired stiffness of the propylene homopolymer. Furthermore, the organometallic transition metal compounds should be able to be obtained in an economical fashion.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) described at the outset.<br>

The nomenclature and the numbering of the ring atoms corresponds to the following examples:<br><br><br><br>
Compared to the previously known metallocenes, the novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) give an increase in the previously achievable molar masses in the copolymerization of propylene with ethylene, and at the same time give a satisfactory molar mass and a high meting point of the isotactic polypropylene in the homopolymerization of propylene.<br>
The novel metallocenes of the formula (I) can be prepared by methods as described in<br>
WO 01/48034. These methods usually produce the organometallic transition metal compounds of<br>
the formula (I) together with a further diastereomer.<br><br>
The organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) (rac or pseudo-rac) can also be used as a diastereomer mixture with the undesired diastereomers coproduced in their synthesis (meso or pseudo-meso) in the preparation of the catalyst. The organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) produce highly isotactic polypropylene, while the corresponding undesired diastereomers generally give atactic polypropylene.<br>
The separation of the diastereomers is known in principle.<br><br>
The invention further provides biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems of the formula (II)<br><br>
or its double bond isomers,<br>
where the variables R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 R6, R7, R8, Z and A are as defined for the formula (I).<br>
The substitution pattern of the biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems of the formula (II) is critical for the particular polymerization properties of the organometallic transition metal compounds containing these biscyclopentadienyl ligand systems.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of a biscyclopentadienyl ligand system of the formula (II) for preparing an organometallic transition metal compound, preferably for preparing an organometallic transition metal compound of an element of group 4 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in particular zirconium.<br>
Thus, a process for preparing an organometallic transition metal compound which comprises reacting a biscyclopentadienyl ligand system of the formula (II) or a bisanion prepared therefrom with a transition metal compound is also subject matter of the present invention. It is usual firstly to doubly deprotonate a ligand system of the formula (II) using a base such as n-butyllithium and subsequently to react the resulting bisanion with a suitable transition metal source such as zirconium tetrachloride. As an alternative, the uncharged biscyclopentadienyl ligand system of the formula (II) can be reacted directly with a suitable transition metal source which has strongly basic ligands, for example tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium.<br>
The steric interaction of the radical R5 of the one cyclopentadienyl ligand with the divalent group Z of the second cyclopentadienyl ligand is of particular importance for the polymerization properties of the organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I)<br><br>
Indenes of the formula (Ilia) or their double bond isomers of the formula (lllb)<br><br>
where the variables R1, R2, R3, R4 and Z are as defined for the formula (I)<br>
can be prepared from known or readily obtainable precursors. Preference is given to a process in which an indanone of the formula (IV) is converted into an indanone of the formula (V) bearing a leaving group L, where L is preferably a halogen, in particular bromine. The leaving group L is subsequently, as described, for example, in WO 98/40331, replaced by the radical R3 and the resulting indanone (VI) is reduced to form the indanol which is subsequently dehydrated to give the indene of the formula (Ilia) or (lllb).<br><br>
As an alternative, the indanone of the formula (V) can firstly be reacted to form an indene in which the leaving group L is subsequently replaced by a radical R3 using a method analogous to that described in US 5,789,634.<br>
The novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) act, particularly in the presence of suitable cocatalysts, as highly active catalyst constituents for the polymerization of olefins.<br><br>
The cocatalyst which together with the novel organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I) forms a polymerization-active catalyst system is able to convert the organometallic transition metal compound into a species which is polymerization-active toward at least one olefin. The cocatalyst is therefore sometimes also referred to as activating compound. The polymerization-active transition metal species is frequently a cationic species. In this case, the cocatalyst is frequently also referred to as cation-forming compound.<br>
The present invention therefore further provides a catalyst system for the polymerization of olefins, which comprises at least one organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I) and at least one cocatalyst which is able to convert the organometallic transition metal compound into a species which is polymerization-active toward at least one olefin.<br>
Suitable cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds are, for example, compounds such as aluminoxanes, strong uncharged Lewis acids, ionic compounds having a Lewis-acid cation or anionic compounds containing BrOnsted acids as cations. Preference is given to an aluminoxane as cocatalyst.<br>
In the case of metallocene complexes as organometallic transition metal compounds, the cocatalysts are frequently also referred to as compounds capable of forming metallocenium ions.<br>
As aluminoxanes, it is possible to use, for example, the compounds described in WO 00/31090. Open-chain or cyclic aluminoxane compounds of the formula (VII) or (VIII)<br><br>
where<br>
R19	is a CrC4-alkyl group, preferably a methyl or ethyl group, and m is an integer from 5 to<br>
30, preferably from 10 to 25,<br>
are particularly useful.<br><br>
These oligomeric aluminoxane compounds are usually prepared by reacting a solution of trialkylaluminum with water. In general, the oligomeric aluminoxane compounds obtained in this way are in the form of mixtures of both linear and cyclic chain molecules of various lengths, so that m may be regarded as a mean. The aluminoxane compounds can also be present in a mixture with other metal alkyls, preferably aluminum alkyls.<br>
Furthermore, modified aluminoxanes in which some of the hydrocarbon radicals or hydrogen atoms have been replaced by alkoxy, aryloxy, siloxy or amide groups can also be used in place of the aluminoxane compounds of the formula (VII) or (VIII).<br>
It has been found to be advantageous to use the novel organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I) and the aluminoxane compounds in such amounts that the atomic ratio of aluminum from the aluminoxane compounds to the transition metal from the organometallic transition metal compound is in the range from 10:1 to 1 000:1, preferably in the range from 20:1 to 500:1 and in particular in the range from 30:1 to 400:1.<br>
As strong, uncharged Lewis acids, preference is given to compounds of the formula (IX)<br>
M3X1X2X3	(IX)<br>
where<br>
M3	is an element of group 13 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in particular B, Al<br>
or Ga, preferably B,<br>
X1, X2 and X3    are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, C1-C10-alkyl, C1-C15-aryl,<br>
alkylaryl, arylalkyl, haloalkyl or haloaryl each having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl radical or fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, in particular haloaryl, preferably pentafluorophenyl.<br>
Further examples of strong, uncharged Lewis acids are given in WO 00/31090.<br>
Particular preference is given to compounds of the formula (IX) in which X1, X2 and X3 are identical, preferably tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.<br>
Strong uncharged Lewis acids which are suitable as cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds also include the reaction products from the reaction of a boronic acid with two equivalents of a trialkylaluminum or the reaction products from the reaction of a trialkylaluminum with two equivalents of an acidic fiuorinated, in particular perfluorinated, hydrocarbon compound such as pentafluorophenol or bis(pentafluorophenyl)borinic acid.<br><br>
Suitable ionic compounds having Lewis-acid cations include salt-like compounds of the cation of the formula (X)<br>
[(Ya+)Q1Q2...Q*]d+	(X)<br>
where<br>
Y	is an element of groups 1 to 16 of the Periodic Table of the Elements,<br>
Q1 to Qz	are each singly negatively charged groups such as the C1-C28-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl,<br>
alkylaryl, arylalkyl, haloalkyl, haloaryl each having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl radical and from 1 to 28 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, C3-C10-cycloalkyI which may bear C1-C10-alkyl groups as substituents, halogen, C1-C28-alkoxy, C6-C15~aryloxy, silyl or mercaptyl groups,<br>
a	is an integer from 1 to 6 and<br>
z	is an integer from 0 to 5, and<br>
d	corresponds to the difference a - z, but d is greater than or equal to 1.<br>
Particularly useful cations are carbonium cations, oxonium cations and sulfonium cations and also cationic transition metal complexes. Particular mention may be made of the triphenylmethyl cation, the silver cation and the 1,1'-dimethylferrocenyl cation. They preferably have noncoordinating counterions, in particular boron compounds as are also mentioned in WO 91/09882, preferably tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate.<br>
Salts having noncoordinating anions can also be prepared by mixing a boron or aluminum compound, e.g. an aluminum alkyl, with a second compound which can react to link two or more boron or aluminum atoms, e.g. water, and a third compound which forms an ionizing ionic compound with the boron or aluminum compound, e.g. triphenylchloromethane. In addition, a fourth compound which likewise reacts with the boron or aluminum compound, e.g. pentafluorophenol, can be added.<br>
Ionic compounds containing Bronsted acids as cations likewise preferably have noncoordinating counterions. As Bronsted acids, particular preference is given to protonated amine or aniline derivatives. Preferred cations are N.N-dimethylanilinium, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium and N,N-dimethylbenzylammonium and also derivatives of the latter two.<br>
i     Preferred ionic compounds as cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds are, in particular, N.N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylcyclohexyiammonium<br><br>
tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and N.N-dimethylbenzylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-borate.<br>
It is also possible for two or more borate anions to be joined to one another, as in the dianion [(C6F5)2B-C6F4-B(C6F5)2]2"I or the borate anion can be bound via a bridge having a suitable functional group to the surface of a support particle.<br>
Further suitable cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds are listed in WO 00/31090.<br>
The amount of strong, uncharged Lewis acids, ionic compounds having Lewis-acid cations or ionic compounds containing BrSnsted acids as cations is usually from 0.1 to 20 equivalents, preferably from 1 to 10 equivalents, based on the novel organometailic transitional metal compound of the formula (I).<br>
Further suitable cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds are boron-aluminum compounds such as di[bis(pentafluorophenylboroxy)]methylalane. Such boron-aluminum compounds are disclosed, for example, in WO 99/06414.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of all the abovementioned cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds. Preferred mixtures comprise aluminoxanes, in particular methylaluminoxane, and an ionic compound, in particular one containing the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate anion, and/or a strong uncharged Lewis acid, in particular tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.<br>
Preference is given to using both the novel organometailic transition metal compound of the formula (I) and the cocatalysts or cation-forming compounds in a solvent, in which case aromatic hydrocarbons having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular xylenes and toluene, are preferred.<br>
The catalyst can further comprise a metal compound of the formula (XI),<br>
M4(R20)r(R21)s(R22)t      (XI)<br>
where<br>
M4	is an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal or a metal of group 13 of the Periodic<br>
Table, i.e. boron, aluminum, gallium, indium or thallium,<br>
R20	is hydrogen,C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C1s-aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl each having from 1<br>
to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part,<br><br>
R21 and R22       are identical or different and are each hydrogen, halogen, C1-C10-alkyl,<br>
C6-C15-aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl or alkoxy each having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl radical,<br>
r	is an integer from 1 to 3,<br>
and<br>
s and t	are integers from 0 to 2, with the sum r+s+t corresponding to the valence of M4,<br>
where the metal compound of the formula (XI) is usually not identical to the cocatalyst or the cation-forming compound. It is also possible to use mixtures of various metal compounds of the formula (XI).<br>
Among the metal compounds of the formula (XI), preference is given to those in which<br>
M4	is lithium, magnesium or aluminum and<br>
R21 and R22      are each C1-C-alkyl.<br>
Particularly preferred metal compounds of the formula (XI) are n-butyllithium, n-butyl-n-octylmagnesium, n-butyl-n-heptylmagnesium, tri-n-hexylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, triethylaluminum and trimethylaluminum and mixtures thereof.<br>
When a metal compound of the formula (XI) is used, it is preferably present in the catalyst in such an amount that the molar ratio of M4 from formula (XI) to transition metal M1 from the novel organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I) is from 800:1 to 1:1, in particular from 200:1 to 2:1.<br>
Particular preference is given to a catalyst system comprising a novel organometallic transition metal compound of the formula (I) and at least one cocatalyst and additionally a support.<br>
To obtain such a supported catalyst system, the unsupported catalyst system can be reacted with a support. In principle, the order in which the support, the organometallic transition metal compound according to the present invention and the cocatalyst are combined is immaterial. The organometallic transition metal compound and the cocatalyst can be immobilized independently of one another or simultaneously. After the individual process steps, the solid can be washed with suitable inert solvents, e.g. aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
As supports, preference is given to using finely divided supports which can be any organic or inorganic, inert solids. In particular, the support can be a porous solid such as talc, a sheet<br><br>
silicate, an inorganic oxide or a finely divided polymer powder (e.g. polyolefin).<br>
Suitable inorganic oxides may be found among the oxides of elements of groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Examples of oxides preferred as supports include silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and also mixed oxides of the elements calcium, aluminum, silicon, magnesium or titanium and also corresponding oxide mixtures. Other inorganic oxides which can be used alone or in combination with the abovementioned preferred oxidic supports are, for example, MgO, Zr02, Ti02 or B203. A preferred mixed oxide is, for example, calcined hydrotalcite.<br>
The support materials used preferably have a specific surface area in the range from 10 to 1 000 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.1 to 5 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 1 to 500 pm. Preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 50 to 500 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.5 to 3.5 ml/g and a mean particle size in the range from 5 to 350 pm. Particular preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 200 to 400 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.8 to 3.0 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 10 to 100 pm.<br>
The inorganic support can be subjected to a thermal treatment, e.g. to remove adsorbed water. Such a drying treatment is generally carried out at from 80 to 300°C, preferably from 100 to 200°C, with drying at from 100 to 200°C preferably being carried out under reduced pressure and/or a blanket of inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), or the inorganic support can be calcined at from 200 to 1 000°C to produce the desired structure of the solid and/or set the desired OH concentration on the surface. The support can also be treated chemically using customary desiccants such as metal alkyls, preferably aluminum alkyls, chlorosilanes or SiCI4, or else methylaluminoxane. Appropriate treatment methods are described, for example, in WO 00/31090. The inorganic support material can also be chemically modified. For example, treatment of silica gel with (NH4)2SiF6 leads to fluorination of the silica gel surface, or treatment of silica gels with silanes containing nitrogen-, fluorine- or sulfur-containing groups leads to correspondingly modified silica gel surfaces.<br>
Organic support materials such as finely divided polyolefin powders (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene) can also be used and are preferably likewise freed of adhering moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by means of appropriate purification and drying operations before use. It is also possible to use functionalized polymer supports, e.g. supports based on polystyrene, via whose functional groups, for example ammonium or hydroxy groups, at least one of the catalyst components can be immobilized.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the preparation of the supported catalyst system, at least one of the novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) is brought into contact in a suitable solvent with at least one cocatalyst as activating or cation-forming compound, giving a<br><br>
soluble or insoluble, preferably soluble, reaction product, an adduct or a mixture.<br>
The preparation obtained in this way is then mixed with the dehydrated or passivated support material, the solvent is removed and the resulting supported organometallic transition metal catalyst system is dried to ensure that the solvent is completely or mostly removed from the pores of the support material. The supported catalyst is usually obtained as a free-flowing powder. Examples of the industrial implementation of the above process are described in WO 96/00243, WO 98/40419 or WO 00/05277.<br>
A further preferred embodiment comprises firstly immobilizing the cocatalyst or the cation-forming compound on the support material and subsequently bringing this supported cocatalyst or this cation-forming compound into contact with the organometallic transition metal compound according to the present invention.<br>
Cocatalyst systems of significance therefore likewise include combinations which are obtained by combining the following components:<br>
1st component:	at least one defined boron or aluminum compound,<br>
2nd component:	at least one uncharged compound which has at least one acidic<br>
hydrogen atom,<br>
3rd component:	at least one support, preferably an inorganic oxidic support and<br>
optionally as 4th component a base, preferably an organic nitrogen-containing base such as an amine, an aniline derivative or a nitrogen heterocycle.<br>

It is likewise possible firstly to prepolymerize the catalyst solid with a-olefins, preferably linear C2-C10-1-alkenes and in particular ethylene or propylene, and then to use the resulting prepolymerized catalyst solid in the actual polymerization. The mass ratio of catalyst solid used in the prepolymerization to monomer polymerized onto it is usually in the range from 1:0.1 to 1:200.<br>
Furthermore, a small amount of an olefin, preferably an a-olefin, for example vinylcyclohexane, styrene or phenyldimethylvinylsilane, as modifying component, an antistatic or a suitable inert compound such as a wax or oil can be added as additive during or after the preparation of the supported catalyst system. The molar ratio of additives to organometallic transition metal compound according to the present invention is usually from 1:1 000 to 1 000:1, preferably from 1:5 to 20:1.<br>
The novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) or the catalyst systems in which they are present are suitable for the polymerization or copolymerization of olefins.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides a process for preparing polyolefins by polymerization or copolymerization of at least one olefin in the presence of a catalyst system comprising at least one of the novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I).<br>
In general, the catalyst system is used together with a further metal compound of the formula (XI), which can be different from the metal compound or compounds of the formula (XI) used in the preparation of the catalyst system, for the polymerization or copolymerization of olefins. The further metal compound is generally added to the monomer or the suspension medium and serves to purify the monomer of substances which can adversely affect the catalyst activity. It is also possible to add one or more further cocatalytic or cation-forming compounds to the catalyst system in the polymerization process.<br>
The olefins can be functionalized, olefinically unsaturated compounds such as ester or amide derivatives of acrylic or methacrylic acid, for example acrylates, methacrylates or acrylonitrile, or nonpolar olefinic compounds including aryl-substituted a-olefins.<br>
Preference is given to polymerizing olefins of the formula Rm-CH=CH-Rn, where Rm and Rn are identical or different and are each hydrogen or an organic radical, in particular a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or Rm and Rn together with the atoms connecting them can form one or more rings.<br><br>
Examples of such olefins are 1-olefins having from 2 to 40, preferably from 2 to 10, carbon atoms, e.g. ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-deceneor 4-methyl-1-pentene, or unsubstituted or substituted vinylaromatic compounds such as styrene and styrene derivatives ordienes such as 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 5-ethyIidene-2-norbomene, norbornadiene, ethylnorbornadiene or cyclic olefins such as norbornene, tetracyclododecene or methylnorbornene. Preference is given to ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-hexene or4-methyl-1-pentene; <br>
The catalyst system of the present invention is particularly preferably used to homopolymerize propene or ethene or copolymerize ethene with C3-Cfl-a-olefins such as propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene and/or 1-octene and/or cyclic olefins such as norbornene and/or dienes having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. 1,4-hexadiene, norbornadiene, ethylidenenorbornene or ethylnorbornadiene, or most preferably to copolymerize propene with ethene and/or 1-butene. Examples of such copolymers are propene-ethene, propene-1-butene, ethene-1-hexene, ethene-1-octene copolymers and ethene-propene-ethylidenenorbornene or ethene-propene-1,4-hexadiene terpolymers.<br>
The polymerization can be carried out in a known manner in bulk, in suspension, in the gas phase or in a supercritical medium in the customary reactors used for the polymerization of olefins. It can be carried out batchwise or preferably continuously in one or more stages. Solution processes, suspension processes, stirred gas-phase processes or gas-phase fluidized-bed processes are all possible. As solvent or suspension medium, it is possible to use inert hydrocarbons, for example isobutane, or else the monomers themselves.<br>
The polymerization can be carried out at from -60 to 300°C and pressures in the range from 0.5 to 3 000 bar. Preference is given to temperatures in the range from 50 to 200°C, in particular from 60 to 100°C, and pressures in the range from 5 to 100 bar, in particular from 15 to 70 bar. The mean residence times are usually from 0.5 to 5 hours, preferably from 0.5 to 3 hours. As molar mass regulator and/or to increase the activity, hydrogen can be used in the polymerization. Furthermore, customary additives such as antistatics can also be used. For the polymerization, the catalyst system of the present invention can be used directly, i.e. it is introduced in pure form into the polymerization system, or it is admixed with inert components such as paraffins, oils or waxes to improve meterabiiity.<br>
The novel organometallic transition metal compounds of the formula (I) or the catalyst systems in which they are present are very particularly useful for preparing polypropylene/propene-ethene copolymer mixtures.<br>
The invention therefore further provides a process for preparing polypropylene/propene-ethene copolymer mixtures in the presence of a catalyst system as described above.<br><br>
The polymers (hereinafter also (co)polymers) prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention display a uniform particle morphology and contain no fines. No deposits or cake material occur in the polymerization using the catalyst system of the present invention.<br>
The (co)polymers obtainable using the catalyst system of the present invention include both homopolymers and random copolymers of propene. Their molar mass Mw (measured by gel permeation chromatography) is in the range from 100 000 to 1 000 000 g/mol and their Mw/Mn (measured by gel permeation chromatography) is in the range from 1.8 to 4.0, preferably from 1.8 to 3.5. Random copolymers of propene contain subordinate amounts of monomers which can be copolymerized with propene, for example C2-C8-aIk-1-enes such as ethene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene or 4-methyl-1-pentene. It is also possible to use two or more different comonomers, which then gives, for example, random terpolymers.<br>
The catalyst system of the present invention is particularly useful for preparing homopolymers of propene or copolymers of propene with up to 50% by weight of other copolymerized 1-alkenes having up to 8 carbon atoms. The copolymers of propene are random copolymers or block or high-impact copolymers. If the copolymers of propene have a random structure, they generally contain up to 50% by weight, preferably up to 15% by weight, particularly preferably up to 5% by weight, of other 1-alkenes having up to 8 carbon atoms, in particular ethene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene or a mixture of ethene and 1-butene, ethene and 1-hexene or ethene and 4-methyl-1-pentene.<br>
The copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention may also be block or high-impact copolymers of propene which are obtained by, in the first stage, preparing a propylene homopolymer or a random copolymer of propene with from 0.001 to 15% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 6% by weight, of other 1-alkenes having up to 8 carbon atoms (e.g. ethene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene) and then, in the second stage, polymerizing a propene-ethene copolymer which has an ethene content of from 15 to 80% by weightand, if desired, further C4-CB-alk-1-enes (e.g. 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene) onto this. In general, the amount of propene-ethene copolymer (which may comprise 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyM-pentene as further monomers) polymerized on is such that the copolymer produced in the second stage makes up from 3 to 60% by weight of the end product.<br>
The propylene homopolymers and copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention have a content of meso-configured diads (measured by means of 13C-NMR spectroscopy, see examples) of at least 90%, preferably at least 95% and particularly preferably at least 97%.<br>
Random copolymers which have been produced using single-site catalysts (e.g. metallocene catalysts) have a number of particular properties compared to, for example, copolymers produced<br><br>
by means of Ziegler-Natta catalysts and having a comparable comonomer content.<br>
Thus, copolymers produced by means of single-site catalysts have a comonomer distribution which is uniform over their molar mass spectrum. Such a distribution can be determined, for example, by means of a coupled GPC-IR measurement.<br>
In copolymers produced by means of single-site catalysts, the comonomers are randomly distributed, while in the case of copolymers produced by means of Ziegier-Natta catalysts, the comonomer tends to be incorporated in blocks even at low comonomer contents. The comonomer content fluctuates only to a small extent if the fractions comprise a sufficiently large proportion (at least 10%) of the total polymer. In the case of the copolymers prepared using catalyst systems according to the present invention, the comonomer content fluctuates by a maximum of 10%, preferably a maximum of 5%, particularly preferably a maximum of 1.5%, between the fractions representing a sufficiently large proportion.<br>
Copolymers produced by means of single-site catalysts have a narrow molar mass distribution ex reactor (in general, Mw/Mn is 
Furthermore, copolymers produced by means of single-site catalysts have a low proportion of soluble material. When 10 mol% of ethene has been incorporated, the proportion of ether-soluble material is less than 5% by weight.<br>
In addition, a combination of the abovementioned features leads to the polymers (homopolymers and copolymers) prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention being eluted within a narrow temperature range in a TREF. In the case of the homopolymers and random copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention, from 80 to 100% by weight is eluted within a temperature range extending from 15°C below to 15°C above the temperature at which maximum elution occurs ("peak temperature"). The range preferably extends from 15°C below to 10°C above the peak temperature and particularly preferably from 10°C below to 10°C above the peak temperature.<br>
The polymers (homopolymers and copolymers) prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention are suitable for producing hard and stiff shaped bodies, fibers, filaments, injection-molded parts, films, plates or large hollow bodies (e.g. pipes) having a high tensile strength. The shaped parts display, in particular, a high toughness, even at temperatures below 20°C, combined with a high stiffness.<br>
Shaped bodies (e.g. injection-molded articles) comprising the block or high-impact copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention are generally produced by the<br><br>
customary injection-molding processes known to those skilled in the art and have a novel property combination of stiffness, toughness and transparency and also display little stress whitening.<br>
The modulus of elasticity, as a measure of the stiffness of the copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention, measured in a tensile test in accordance with ISO 527 is generally in the range from 500 to 6 000 MPa, preferably in the range from 800 to 2 000 MPa, very particularly preferably in the range from 900 to 1 400 MPa.<br>
The Charpy impact toughness, as a measure of the toughness of the copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention, measured in accordance with ISO 179-2/1eU, is &gt;200 kJ/m2 at 23°C and &gt;200 kJ/m2 at -20°C. Preference is given to no fracture of the test specimen being recorded at 23°C.<br>
The haze, as complementary value to the transparency (% transparency + % haze = 100%), determined in accordance with ASTM D 1003 of the copolymers prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention is preferably less than 40%, particularly preferably less than 30%.<br>
The injection-molded articles produced from the above-described polymers generally contain customary additives known to those skilled in the art, e.g. stabilizers, lubricants and mold release agents, fillers, nucleating agents, antistatics, plasticizers, dyes, pigments or flame retardants, in customary amounts. In general, these are incorporated during granulation of the product obtained in powder form in the polymerization.<br>
Customary stabilizers include antioxidants such as sterically hindered phenols, processing stabilizers such as phosphites or phosphonites, acid scavengers such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate or dihydrotalcite, sterically hindered amines or UV stabilizers. In general, the propylene copolymer compositions according to the present invention contain one or more of the stabilizers in amounts of up to 2% by weight.<br>
Suitable lubricants and mold release agents are, for example, fatty acids, calcium or zinc salts of fatty acids, fatty acid amides or low molecular weight polyolefin waxes, which are usually used in concentrations of up to 2% by weight.<br>
Possible fillers are, for example, talc, chalk or glass fibers which can usually be used in amounts of up to 50% by weight.<br>
Suitable nucleating agents are, for example, inorganic additives such as talc, silica or kaolin, salts of monocarboxylic or polycarboxylic acids, e.g. sodium benzoate or aluminum tert-butylbenzoate, dibenzylidenesorbitol or itsC1-C8-alkyl-substituted derivatives such as methyl-, ethyl- or dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol, or salts of diesters of phosphoric acid, e.g. sodium 2,2'-methylenebis(4t6-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphate. The nucleating agent content of the<br><br>
propylene polymer composition is generally up to 5% by weight.<br>
Such additives are generally commercially available and are described, for example, in Gachter/MGller, Plastics Additives Handbook, 4th Edition, Hansa Publishers, Munich, 1993.<br>

General<br>
The letter uc" at the beginning of an experiment number or designation of a substance denotes experiments or substances which are not according to the present invention and have been included for comparative purposes.<br>
Preparation of the catalyst:<br>
0.206 mmol of a metallocene dichloride were added at room temperature to 4.33 mmol of MAO (30% strength solution in toluene, from Albemarle). The solution was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and was subsequently diluted with 10.9 ml of toluene. The diluted solution was carefully added to 10 g of silica (Sylopol 948, calcined at 600°C, from Grace). Particular attention was paid to the colored solution being uniformly distributed over the support material. After 10 minutes, the flask containing the catalyst suspension was connected to a vacuum line and dried until the content of volatile material had been reduced to less than 5% by weight.<br>
Polymerizations:<br>
Homopolymerizations were carried out in a 101 reactor charged with 3.5 kg of liquid propene. The reactor was made inert by means of nitrogen before being charged. 8 ml of a 20% strength by weight solution of triethylaluminum in Exxsol (from Witco) were introduced into the reactor and the mixture was stirred at 30°C for 15 minutes. If hydrogen was added, its concentration was set to 0.5 standard liters per liter of liquid propylene. A suspension of the respective catalyst in 20 ml of Exxsol was introduced into the reactor. The reactor temperature was increased to 65°C and maintained at this temperature for 60 minutes. The polymerizations were stopped by venting the reactor. The polymers were dried overnight under reduced pressure before being analyzed.<br>
Copolymerizations were carried out in a 10 I reactor charged with 3.5 kg of liquid propylene. A 20% by weight solution of triethylaluminum in Exxsol (from Witco) was introduced into the reactor and the mixture was stirred at 30°C for 15 minutes. A suspension of the respective catalyst in 20 ml of Exxsol was introduced into the reactor. Ethylene was introduced into the reactor (total of 160 g). The reactor temperature was increased to 65°C and maintained at this temperature for 60 minutes. The pressure in the reactor was maintained at 32 bar by continuous addition of ethylene (about 47 g of further ethylene introduced). The polymerizations were stopped by<br><br>
venting the reactor. The polymers were dried overnight under reduced pressure before being analyzed.<br>
General procedures for the handling and synthesis of air- and moisture-sensitive substances: The synthesis and handling of the organometallic compounds and the catalysts was carried out with exclusion of air and moisture under argon (glove box and Schlenk techniques). All solvents used were purged with argon and dried over molecular sieves before use. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether and toluene were dried over sodium/benzophenone, pentane was dried over sodium/benzophenone/triglyme and dichloromethane was dried over calcium hydride by refluxing for a number of hours, and the solvents were subsequently distilled off and stored over 4A molecular sieves.<br>
Anhydrous aluminum trichloride, indane (95% pure) and 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (98% pure) were procured from Aldrich Chemical Company.<br>
Mass spectra were measured using a Hewlett Packard series 6890 instrument which was<br>
equipped with a series 5973 mass analyzer (El, 70 eV).<br>
NMR spectra of organic and organometallic compounds were recorded on a Varian<br>
Unity-300 NMR spectrometer at room temperature. The chemical shifts are reported relative to<br>
SiMe4.<br>
Determination of the melting point:<br>
The melting point Tm was determined by means of a DSC measurement in accordance with ISO Standard 3146 in a first heating phase at a heating rate of 20°C per minute to 200°Cf a dynamic crystallization at a cooling rate of 20°C per minute down to 25°C and a second heating phase at a heating rate of 20°C per minute back to 200°C. The melting point was then the temperature at which the curve of enthalpy versus temperature measured in the second heating phase displayed a maximum.<br>
Gel permeation chromatography:<br>
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out at 145°C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using a Waters 150C GPC apparatus. The evaluation of the data was carried out using the software Win-GPC from HS-Entwicklungsgesellschaftfur wissenschaftliche Hard- und Software mbH, Ober-Hiibersheim. The columns were calibrated by means of polypropylene standards having molar masses ranging from 100 to 107 g/mol. The mass average molar mass (Mw) and number average molar mass (Mn) of the polymers were determined. The Q value is the ratio of mass average molar mass (Mw) to number average molar mass (Mn).<br>
Determination of the viscosity number (I.V.):<br>
The viscosity number was determined in an Ubbelohde viscometer PVS 1 fitted with an S 5<br>
measuring head (both from Lauda) in decalin at 135°C. To prepare the sample, 20 mg of polymer<br><br>
were dissolved in 20 ml of decalin at 135°C for 2 hours. 15 ml of the solution were placed in the viscometer and the instrument carried out a minimum of three running-out time measurements until a consistent result had been obtained. The I.V. was calculated from the running-out times by means of the relationship I.V. = (t/to-1)*1/c, where t = mean of the running-out time of the solution, to = mean of the running-out time of the solvent, c: concentration of the solution in g/ml.<br>

1a        Preparation of 2-methyl-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-s-indacen-1(2H)-one (1a) 50.71 g (377 mmol) of anhydrous aluminum trichloride were slowly added at 0°C to a mixture of 19.3 g (163 mmol) of indane and 38.3 g of 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide in 500 ml of methylene chloride over a period of 30 minutes. The reaction mixture became dark red. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 17 hours and subsequently poured onto 200 g of ice. The phases were separated. The organic phase was washed once with 200 ml of 1 normal hydrochloric acid, twice with 200 ml each time of saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and twice with 200 ml each time of water. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave 30 g (99% yield) of the compound (1a) as reddish brown oil. According to GC-MS, the content of (1a) in the oil was 99%.<br>

After stirring for one hour, a solution of 8 ml (160 mmol) of bromine in 20 ml of chloroform was added dropwise to the mixture at 0°C and the mixture was subsequently stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into 500 g of an ice/water mixture. The organic phase was separated off, washed with 5% strength sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and<br><br>
water and subsequently dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of the solvent under<br>
reduced pressure gave 51 g of a red oil. GC-MS analysis indicated that the oil contained 84% of<br>
the desired compound (1b) and 14% of a dibromide by-product. The mixture was separated by<br>
column chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as eluant. This gave 18.7 g (44%<br>
yield) of the compound (1 b).<br>

indacen-7-yl)(2-isopropyl-4-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride (1) 3.8 ml (9.6 mmol) of a solution of n-butyllithium in toluene (2.5 molar) were added at -70°C to a solution of 3.1 g (4.8 mmol) of dimethylsilanediyl-(4-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)-6-methyl-l ,2,3,5-tetrahydro-s-indacen-7-yl)(2-isopropyl-4-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)-1-indene) (1e) in 100 ml of diethyl ether. The reaction mixture was subsequently stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled back down to -70°C. A suspension of 1.1 g (4.8 mmol) of zirconium tetrachloride in 50 ml of n-pentane was added and the reaction mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight.
