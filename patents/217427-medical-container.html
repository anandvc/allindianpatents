MEDICAL  CONTAINER<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The present  invention relates  to  a medical<br>
container,  which  is  used  by  filling  blood,  medicament  or<br>
the like in it. The application claims the benefit of U.S.<br>
provisional Application  No.  60/455,564,  filed on  March  19,<br>
2003,  which  is  hereby  incorporated  by  reference,  and  is<br>
based  on  Japanese  Patent  Application  No.  2003-033440  filed<br>
on February  12, 2003, which  is hereby  incorporated  by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A medical container for filling blood, medicament<br>
or the like is demanded not only to be, needless to say,<br>
hygienic but also to have high heat resistance capable of<br>
enduring sterilization treatment at a high temperature,<br>
transparency to enable the check of mingling of a foreign<br>
material or visual inspection of the change by blending of<br>
a medicament, impact resistance sufficiently high. to<br>
prevent the bag from rupturing at falling on handling or at<br>
packaging and transportation, flexibility for facilitating<br>
the  discharge  of  contents,  and  blocking  resistance  not  to<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
2<br>
readily cause separation of film or sheet at the production<br>
of a medical container or not to contact a medicament-<br>
containing medical container with its outer packaging bag.<br>
In particular, demands are increasing for a medical<br>
container which can be sterilized at a high temperature of<br>
1210C or more having a strong sterilization power, can<br>
satisfy all of heat resistance, transparency, impact<br>
resistance, flexibility and .blocking resistance, and can be<br>
industrially produced.<br>
For the medical container, a soft polyvinyl<br>
chloride, a polyethylene base material such as high-<br>
pressure low-density polyethylene, linear low-density<br>
polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and ethylens-vinyl<br>
acetate copoiymer, and a polypropylene-bass material such<br>
as propylene homopolymer and random or block copolymer of<br>
propylene  and other a-olefin have been heretofore used.<br>
The vinyl chloride-base resin is excellent in the<br>
balance of heat resistance, transparency, flexibility and<br>
impact resistance but this resin has a problem in that a<br>
plssticizer used for imparting the performance dissolves<br>
out into  a medicament solution or food.<br>
Out of polyethylene-base materials, the high-<br>
pressure low-density polyethylene is deficient in that the<br>
heat resistance or impact strength is poor. As for the<br>
linear  low-density  polyethylene,  a. .polyethylene.  having  a<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
3<br>
low density is used so as to enhance the transparency or<br>
flexibility, but when the density is decreased,<br>
insufficient heat resistance is liable to result and<br>
furthermore, problems arise, for example, the low molecular<br>
weight component of the resin lowers the blocking<br>
resistance of the container or dissolves out into a<br>
medicament.        The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is<br>
excellent in the transparency but disadvantageously low in<br>
the heat resistance. The high-density polyethylene is<br>
deficient in that the transparency and impact resistance<br>
are poor. Thus,  polyethylene-base materials cannot satisfy<br>
a good balance of heat resistance, transparency and impact<br>
resistance.<br>
Out of polypropylene-base materials, the propylene<br>
homopolymer and propylene random copolyiner are excellent in<br>
the transparency but inferior in the blocking resistance,<br>
and the propylene block copolymer is poor in the balance of<br>
flexibility,  impact  resistance and transparency.<br>
For solving these problems, with respect to the<br>
medical container using a polyethylene-base material, a<br>
multilayer container having a layer mainly comprising a<br>
high-density polyethylene and a layer mainly comprising a<br>
linear low-density polyethylene has been proposed (see, for<br>
example, JP-&amp;-5-293160 (the term "JP-A" as used herein<br>
means   an  "unexamined  published  Japanese  patent<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
4<br>
application").<br>
Furthermore, a polyethylene-base material produced<br>
by using a metallocene-base catalyst and having excellent<br>
Impact resistance and transparency has been  recently<br>
developed and studies are being made to apply this material<br>
to a medical container. Also, a method of using these<br>
materials in combination and stacking two, three or more<br>
layers has been proposed  (see,  for example,  JP-A-7-125738) .<br>
On the other hand, with respect to the medical<br>
container using a polypropylene-base material, a technique<br>
of using a resin composition comprising a propylene-base<br>
random copolymer having an a-olefin content of 5 to 8 mass%<br>
and a mixture of specific sthylene-propylene and fethylene—<br>
butene random copolymets to obtain a container excellent in.<br>
the heat resistance, transparency, impact resistance and<br>
the like has been disclosed, (see, for example, JF-A-B-<br>
2317 97).<br>
Also, a container having a constitution such that a<br>
layer comprising a propylens homopolymer or propylene-a-<br>
olefin random capolymer containing from 0 to - 30% of a<br>
polyethylene-base resin is provided as the outer layer and<br>
a three-layer laminate comprising a mixture of a propylene -<br>
homopolymer or a propylene/a-olefin random copolymer and an<br>
olefin-base elastomer or the like is provided as the<br>
intermediate layer has been proposed  (see,  for ex ample,  JP-<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
5<br>
A-9-26294B).<br>
Furthermore, a technique of using a resin<br>
composition comprising a crystalline polypropylene and a<br>
propylene/a-olefin copolymer having a specific limiting<br>
viscosity ratio, and forming a specific morphology at the<br>
thermoforntatian has been proposed (see, for example, JP-A-<br>
10-316810).<br>
However, the container described in JP-A-5-293160<br>
cannot always hold a sufficient transparency after<br>
stetilization at a temperature of 121°C or more and fails<br>
in fully satisfying the requirement on the market that<br>
sterilination can be performed at a higher temperature in a<br>
shorter time.<br>
Also in the case of using the laminate described in<br>
JF-A-7-125738, the transparency after high-temperature<br>
stetilization of 121°C or more is not sufficiently high and<br>
moreover, the impact resistance is also insufficient to<br>
readily cause rupture at the heat-welded part on falling of<br>
the container, therefore, improvements are demanded.<br>
Furthermore, a film or sheet obtained by a water cooling<br>
inflation method, a T-die method or the like has<br>
particularly a smooth surface and readily causes blokcing<br>
of films or sheets with each other and when these are<br>
pulled apartr a whitened flaw remains on the surface and<br>
the  outer  appearance  is  seriously  deteriorated  in  some<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
6<br>
cases,<br>
The resin composition described in JP-A-8-2 31787<br>
has a problem that the heat resistance and transparency are<br>
still insufficient.<br>
The container described In JP-A-9-262'948 does not<br>
have a sufficiently high impact resistance and<br>
particularly, in the case of a container having a volume of<br>
1 L or more, the impact resistance is not satisfied from.<br>
the  standpoint  of  preventing rupture  on  falling.<br>
The method described in JP-A-10-316810 has a<br>
problem in that not only the impact resistance or the<br>
thermal shrinkage percentage at the heat sterilization<br>
expresses strong anisotropy due to orientation of the<br>
domain but also stable production while keeping the quality<br>
can be hardly attained because the formation of specific<br>
morphology is sensitive to the molding conditions or the<br>
like.<br>
The present invention has been made under these<br>
circumstances and an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a medical container having heat resistance high<br>
enough to enable sterilisation at a temperature of 121°C or<br>
more and exhibiting excellent properties in all of ths<br>
transparency, impact resistance, flexibility and blocking<br>
resistance.<br><br>

DISCLOSURE OF  INVENTION<br>
As a result of extensive investigations, the<br>
present inventors have found that the above-described<br>
object can be attained by a medical container using a<br>
polyalefin resin composition containing specific<br>
components, where the xylene-soluble portion has a<br>
refractive index within a specific range. Based on this<br>
finding, the following medical container has been<br>
accomplished.<br>
More specifically, the medical container of the<br>
present invention is produced from a film or sheet having<br>
at least  one resin layer comprising a polyolefin reain<br>
composition, wherein the polyolefin resin composition<br>
comprises (A) at least one propylene-base polymer selected<br>
from the group consisting of (Al) a propylene-base polymer<br>
composition as a mixture of (All) a propylene polymer and<br>
(A12) an ethylene-propylene copolymer elastomer, (A2) a.<br>
propylene-base black copolymer, and (A3) a psropylene-bsse<br>
block copolymer composition as a mixture of (A2) a<br>
propylene-base block copolymar and (A12) an ethylene-<br>
propylene copolymer elastomer, and (B) an ethylene-base<br>
copolymer comprising an ethylene end at least one a-olefin<br>
having 4 or more carbon atoms, and the refractive index of<br>
the xylene-soluble portion is  from 1.480  to  1.4 95.<br>
In  the medical  container  of  the present  invention,<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
8<br>
the polyolefin, resin composition preferably has a xylene-<br>
soluble portion content of 20  to 70 mass%.<br>
Furthermore, in the polyolefin resin composition,<br>
the ratio (MFRA/MFRg) of the melt flow rate (MFRA) of the<br>
propylene-base polymer (A) to the melt flow rate (MFRB) of<br>
ths ethylene-base copolymer (B) is pteferably front 0.3 to<br>
3.0.<br>
The medical container of the present invention may<br>
also be produced such that the film or sheet has a first<br>
high-density polyethylene layer containing a high-density<br>
polyethylene and this first high-density polyethylene layer<br>
is disposed in the inner side.<br>
The medical container of the present invention may<br>
also be produced such that the film or sheet has a second<br>
high-density polyethylene layer containing  high-density<br>
polyethylene and this second high-density polyethylene<br>
layer is disposed in the outer side.<br>
In the case where the film or sheet has a first<br>
high-density polyethylene layer, the first high-density<br>
polyethylene layer preferably contains 20 mass% or more of<br>
a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.950 g/cm3<br>
or. more.<br>
In the case where the film or sheet has a second<br>
high-density polyethylene layer, the second high-density<br>
polyethylene, layer  preferably  contains 20 mass%  or more  of<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
9<br>
a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.950 g/cm3<br>
or more.<br>
In the medical container of the present invention,<br>
the thickness of the resin layer comprising a polyolefin<br>
resin composition preferably occupies 60% or more of the<br>
entire thickness  of the film or sheet.<br>
In the present specification, unless otherwise<br>
indicated, MFR is a value measured at 230°C with a load of<br>
21.18  N according to JIS K 7210.<br>
The medical container of the present invention is.<br>
presumed to have excellent properties because of the<br>
following reasons. That is, a resin component having high<br>
crystallinity is considered to impart heat resistance to<br>
the resin and a rubber-analogous resin component having low<br>
crystallinity is considered to impart the impact<br>
resistance. Usually, the refractive index greatly differs<br>
between a component having high crystallinity and a<br>
component having low crystallinity and therefore, a mixture<br>
of these components is decreased in the transparency,<br>
However, in the polyolefin resin composition for use in the<br>
medical container of the present invention, the component<br>
having low crystallinity has a specific refractive index.<br>
More specifically, the refractive index of the xylene-<br>
soluble portion presumed to contain a low crystallinity<br>
component  is in a  specific  range and the difference  in the<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
10<br>
refractive index between the low crystallinity component<br>
and the high crystallinity component is considered to<br>
become small, so that heat resistance and impact resistance<br>
can be imparted without decreasing the transparency. By<br>
using a film or sheet having at least one layer comprising<br>
this polyolefin resin composition, a medical container<br>
excellent in the transparency, impact resistance, heat<br>
resistance, flexibility and blocking resistance can be<br>
obtained,<br>
BEST  MODE  FOR CARRYING  OUT  THE  INVENTION<br>

propylene and ethylene copolymer having an ethylene content<br>
of less than 5 mass% and subsequently a second step of<br>
polymerizing a propylene and ethylene copolymer having an<br>
ethylene content of 10 to 70 mass% in a polymerization<br>
vessel consisting of at least two vessels, which may be the<br>
same as or different from that used in the polymerization<br>
of the first step.<br>
In the propylene-base block copolymer (A2), the<br>
proportion of the polymer produced in the first step is not<br>
particularly limited but this is preferably from 90 to 30<br>
mass%  and in view  of profitability  in the production,  more<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

preferably  from 85  to  50  mass%,  still more  preferably from<br>
80  to  55 mass%.<br>
The ethylene content of the polymer obtained in the<br>
first step is usually less than 5 mass%, preferably less<br>
than 4 mass, more preferably less than 1.5 mass%. If the<br>
ethylene content of the polymer obtained in the first step<br>
is 5 mass% or more, the heat resistance at sterilization is<br>
liable to decrease.<br>
The ethylene content of the polymer obtained in the<br>
second step is usually from 10 to 70 mass%, preferably from<br>
20 to 60 mass%. If the ethylene content of the polymer<br>
obtained in the second step is less than 10 mass%, the<br>
impact resistance readily decreases, where as if it exceeds<br>
70 mass%,  the transparency sometimes decreases.<br>
The catalyst used in the polymerization of the<br>
first and second steps is not particularly limited and, for<br>
example, a Ziegler  Natta catalyst or a (netallocene<br>
catalyst  is  suitably used.         The process for the<br>
polymerization may be any of a bulk method, a solution<br>
method, a slurry method, a vapor phase method and a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
The propylene-base block copolymer composition  (A3)<br>
(herein after),  sometimes  simply  preferred  to  as  a  component<br>
(A3)   is  a  mixture  of  the  above described  propylene-base<br>
block  copolymer  (A2)  and  an  ethylenie-propylene  copolymer<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

elastomer (A12)  The mixing ratio of (A2) and (A12) is, in<br>
view of high heat resistance, preferably from 90:10 to<br>
50:50,  more preferably from  80:20 to 50:50.<br>
Among those components (Al), (A2) and (A3), the<br>
propylene-base polymer (A) is preferably the component<br>
(A2) , namely, a propylane-base block copolymer, because<br>
this component expresses stable performance and is<br>
inexpensive.<br>
The MFR of the propylene-base polymer (A) is not<br>
particularly limited but this is preferably from 0.1 to 50<br>
g/10 min, more preferably from 0.5 to 20 g/10 min, still<br>
more preferably from 0.5 to 5 g/10 min, because the mold.<br>
processability, heat resistance and impact resistance all<br>
can be enhanced.<br>
The ethylene-base copolymer (B) (hereinafter,     <br>
sometimes simply referred to as component (B) is a<br>
copolymer consisting of an etnylene and at least one a-<br>
olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms and mainly comprising<br>
an ethylene-originated unit (50 mass% or more).  Examples<br>
of the a-olefin include l-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-<br>
pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. As the ethylene-base<br>
copolymer (B)  one or more of these copolymers is (are )<br>
used.<br>
The  density  (according  to  JIS  K  7112  Method  D)  of<br>
the  ethylene-base  copolymer  (B)  is  usually  0.915  g/cm3  or<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br><br>

less  and in view of high transparency,  preferably less than<br>
0.905  g/cm3,  more preferably less than 0,900  g/cm3.<br>
The  MFR  of  the  ethylene-base  copolymer (B)  is  not<br>
particularly limited but this is preferably from 0.1 to 20<br>
g/10 min, because the mold processability, heat resistanoe<br>
and impact resistance all can be enhanced.<br>
In the polyolofin resin composition containing<br>
these components (A) and (B) , the refractive index of the<br>
xylene-soluble portion which dissolves in xylene at<br>
ordinary temperature is from 1.480 to 1.495, preferably<br>
from 1.480 to 1,490. When the refractive index of the<br>
xylene-soluble portion falls in this range, both the impact<br>
resistance and the transparency can be satisfacrtorily high-<br>
If the refractive index of the xylene-saluble portion is<br>
less than 1.490 or exceeds 1.495, the transparency<br>
decreases.<br>
The refractive index at the xylene-soluble  portion<br>
becomes higher as the density of the ethylene-base<br>
copolymer (B) increases, and becomes lower as the density<br>
of the ethylene-base copolymer  (B)  decreases.<br>
The proportion and re refractive index of the xylene-<br>
soluble portion are determined as follows.<br>
A specimen (10 g) of a polyolefin resin composition<br>
is added to 1 L of an orthoxylene and after the temperature<br>
is elevated  to a  boiling temperature (about  1350C) by<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
16<br>
stirring the solution under heating, the specimen is<br>
completely dissolved over 30 minutes or more. After<br>
confirming the complete dissolution with an eye, the<br>
solution is left standing with stirring to cool to 100°C or<br>
less and held in a constant-temperature bath kept at 25°C<br>
for 2 hours.       Thereafter, the precipitated component<br>
(xylene-insoluble portion xi) is separated by filtration<br>
through a filter paper to obtain a filtrate. The obtained<br>
filtrate is heated at a temperature of 1400C to distill out<br>
xylene in a nitrogen stream (about 1 L/min) and the residue<br>
is dried to obtain a xylene-soluble portion Xs . At this<br>
time, the drying of xylene-insoluble portion and xylene—<br>
soluble portion is performed at 60°C under reduced pressure<br>
for one day.<br>
The proportion of the xylene-soluble portion is<br>
determined by  (mass of Xs/mass of specimen).<br>
The xylene-soluble portion is composed of a low<br>
molecular- material in the polyolefin resin composition, a<br>
non-crystalline molecule,  and the like.<br>
In the measurement of refractive index of the.<br>
xylene-soluble portion, the xylene-solable portion is<br>
preheated at 230°C for 5 minutes in a press-molding<br>
machine, then degassed for 30 seconds, pressed at 6 MPa for<br>
1 minute and cooled at 300C for 3 minutes to obtain a film.<br>
having  a  thickness  of  50  to  80  pn.  Subsequently, a<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

specimen  comprising  this  film is  left  standing  at  ordinary<br>
temperature for 24 hours and then measured on the<br>
refractive  index  for  sodium  D  line  at  23°C  by  an  Abbe<br>
refractive  index  meter (manufactured  by  Atago  Co.  Ltd.)<br>
using ethyl salicylate as the intermediate solution.<br>
The content of the xylene-soluble portion in the<br>
polyolefin resin composition, is preferably from 10 to 70<br>
mass%, inore preferably from 20 to 70 mass%, if the xylene-<br>
soluble portion content is less than 10 mass% the impact<br>
strength at low temperatures is liable to be insufficient,<br>
whereas if it exceeds 70 mass%, the heat resistance is<br>
sometimes not satisfied.<br>
In the polyolefin resin composition, the ratio<br>
(MPRA/MFRB)  of  the  MFR  (MFRA)  of  the propylens-base  polymer<br>
(A)  to  the MFR  (MFRB)  of the ethylene-bass  copolymsr  (B)  is<br>
preferably  from  0.3  to  3.0,  more  preferably  from  0.3  to<br>
2.5, still  more  preferably  from  03 . to  2.0.  If  the  MFR<br>
ratio  is  less  than  0.3, the  impact  resistance  at  low<br>
temperatures  is  liable  to  he  insufficient,  whereas  if  it<br>
exceeds  3.0,  fish  eye  is  readily  generated  on  the  film  to<br>
impair the outer appearance.<br>
The proportion of the component (A) in the<br>
polyolefin resin composition is not particularly limited as<br>
long as the refractive index of the xylene-soluble portion<br>
is  in the  rangs  from 1.480 to  1.495,  but  in view  of higher<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

heat resistance,  this  is-usually on the order of  40  to  90<br>
mass%,  preferably from 50 to 70 mass%.<br>
In the polyolefin resin composition, another<br>
polymer may be blended within the range of not impairing<br>
the object of the present invention. Specific examples of<br>
the another polymer which can be blended in the polyolefin<br>
resin composition include polyethylene-base resins such as<br>
high-pressure low-density polyethylene, linear low-density<br>
polyethylene and high-density polyethylene, various<br>
atyrene-base elastomer such as styrene-butadiene elastomer<br>
and hydrogenated product thereof, random copalymers of<br>
propylene and an a-olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms, an<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, copolymers of ethylene<br>
and a (meth) acrylic acid (ester), and olefln-base thernio-<br>
plastic elastomers. The proportion of this another polymer<br>
contained is preferably less than 40 mass% per 100 ruass% of<br>
the polyolefin resin composition.<br>
Examples of  the method for producing  the polyolefin<br>
resin  composition  include  a  melt-kneading  method. In  the<br>
case , of  melt-kneading  the  components  (Al), (A2)  and  (B),<br>
for  example,  the  component (A2)  may  be  meIt-mixed,  after<br>
melt-mixing  the  components  (All),  (R12)  and  (B) . At  this<br>
time,  the  order of melt-mixing the components  (All),  (A12)<br>
and  (B)  is  not  particularly  limited  and  the  component  (B)<br>
may be melt-kneaded, after  obtaining  the  component (Al)  by<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
19<br>
melt-kneading the components (All) and (A12) , or the<br>
components (All) , (A12) and (B) may be simultaneously melt-<br>
kneaded. For the melt-kneading, a single-screw or twin-<br>
screw extruder  can be  usually used.<br>
The thus-produced polyolefin resin composition<br>
contains (A) a propylene-base polymer and (B) an ethylene-<br>
base copolymer and the xylene-soluble portion in the<br>
polyolefin-base resin composition, which is presumed to be<br>
a low crystalline component, has a refractive index of<br>
1.480 to 1.495, so that the resin composition can be<br>
excellent not only in the heat resistance but also in all<br>
of the transparency, impact assistance, flexibility and<br>
blocking  resistance.<br>
The film ex sheet constituting ths medical<br>
container has at least one resin laysr comprising the<br>
above—described polyclefin resin composition. Such a film<br>
or sheet is formed by, for example, an air-cooling or<br>
water-cooling inflation molding method or a T-die method.<br>
This film or sheet may be a single-layer film or<br>
sheet composed o£ a resin layer comprising the polyolefin<br>
resin composition OJC may be a multilayer film or sheet<br>
including a resin layer comprising the polyolefin resin<br>
composition.<br>
The thickness of the film or sheet is usually from<br>
30  to  1,000  pm  and  in  view  of  flexibility  and  strength.<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
20<br>
preferably  from  50  to  100  pm  more  preferably  from  100  to<br>
500 pm.<br>
In the case where the film or sheet is composed of<br>
two or more layers, by taking account of transparency,<br>
impact resistance and heat resistance, the thickness of the<br>
resin layer comprising the polyolefin resin composition<br>
preferably occupies 60% or more of the entire thickness of<br>
the film or sheet.<br>
In the case of a multilayer film or sheet, the<br>
multilayer film can be produced by an extrusion lamination<br>
method of laminating a single layer or multilayer melt<br>
resin including at least one resin layer comprising the<br>
above-described polyolefin resin composition on a film<br>
fo rised of the same or different material, or by a dry<br>
lamination method of laminating a film formed of the same<br>
ot different material and a single layer or multilayer body<br>
including at least one resin layer comprising the above-<br>
described polyolefin resin composition, through an<br>
adhesive.<br>
The medical container is produced from a film or a<br>
sheet and has, for example, a bag form. This medical<br>
container may be a single chamber container or a container<br>
with multiple chambers divided by an easily separable<br>
partition  part or a resin-made partition  member.       If<br>
desired,  the medical  container  may  be  fixed  with  a  mouth<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
21<br>
member for injection or ejection or with another medicament<br>
container for the purpose of mixed infusion, by heat-<br>
sealing or the like.<br>
Examples of the method for producing the medical<br>
container include a method of cutting the above-described<br>
film or sheet and heat-sealing the marginal parts thereo<br>
to form a desired container shape. In this method, the<br>
order of cutting and heat-sealing may be reversed.<br>
The heat-sealing method at the formation of the<br>
film or sheet into a container shape is not particularly<br>
limited and, for example, welding methods such as hot-plate<br>
sealing method, high-frequency sealing method and<br>
ultrasonic wave sealing method can be employed. However,<br>
the heat-sealing conditions such as heat-sealing<br>
temperature and shape of the heat- sealed part are<br>
preferably set not to impair the performance of the medical<br>
container,  such as outer appearance and impact resistance.<br>
The medical container can be easily produced when<br>
it is formed of a single layer film or sheet, and is more<br>
enhanced in the hygiene heat resistance and the like when,<br>
it  is  formed of a multilayer film or sheet.<br>
Particularly, when the film or sheet is a<br>
multilayer body having a first high-density pclyethylene<br>
layer containing a high-density polyethylene and the<br>
medical  container  is produced by  disposing  the  first  high-<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

density polyethylene layer in the inner side, a medicament<br>
comes into contact with this first high-density<br>
polyethylene layer and therefore, not only the hygiene is<br>
more improved but also the impact resistance at low<br>
temperatures, the appearance of heat-sealed part, the<br>
strength  and the  like are  enhanced.<br>
Also, when the film or sheet is a multilayer body<br>
having a second high-density polyethylene layer containing<br>
a high-density polyethylene and the medical container is<br>
produced by disposing this second high-density polyethylene<br>
layer in the outer side, the impact resistance at low<br>
temperatures is enhanced.        In particular, a medical<br>
container  produced  by  disposing  the  second  high-density<br>
polyethylene  layer  as  the  outermost  layer  is  preferred,<br>
because  blocking  with  the  outer  packaging  material  of  the<br>
medical container hardly occurs.<br>
Accordingly, in a more preferred embodiment, the<br>
midical container has a high-density polyethylene layer in<br>
the  inner and outer  sides.<br>
Furthermore, when the film or sheet is a multilayer<br>
body having a layer containing a propylene-ethylene random<br>
copolymer and the medical container is produced by<br>
disposing this propylene-ethylene random copolymer-<br>
containing layer in the inner side and/or in the outer<br>
side,  the heat resistance is more enhanced.<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

The high-density polyethylene contained in the<br>
first high-density polyethylene layer and the second high-<br>
density polyethylene layer is an ethylene homopolymer or an<br>
ethylene  a—olefin copolymer of ethylene and a slight<br>
amount of a-olefin having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of the a-olefin in the ethylene a-olefin copolymer<br>
include propylene, l-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hsxene, 4-methyl-<br>
1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene and l-dodecene. These are<br>
used individually or in combination of two or more. Among<br>
these, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene<br>
and 1-octene  are preferred.<br>
Such a high-density polyethylene is produced by<br>
various processes such as slurry method, vapor phase method<br>
and solution method, preferably using a ziegler Natta<br>
catalyst  or a  metallocene catalyst.<br>
The density (according to JIS K 7112 Method D) of<br>
this high-density polyethylene is usually 0.940 g/cam3 or<br>
mote, preferably 0.950 g/cm3 or more, more preferably 0.-955<br>
g/cm3 or more. If the density is less than 0.940 g/cm3,<br>
insufficient heat resistance results in some cases and<br>
deformation, shrinkage or reduction of transparency may<br>
occur  at  the sterilization  at  a  temperature exceeding<br>
121°C.<br>
The HFR (at 1900C with a load of 21-18 N according<br>
to JIS K  7210) of  the high-detisity  polyethylene is<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>
24<br>
approximately from 0.1 to 50 g/10 min, preferably from 0.5<br>
to 20 g/10 min. With an MFR of approximately from 0.1 to<br>
50 g/10 min, an appropriate melt tension can be obtained at<br>
the molding and a film or sheet can be easily  formed.<br>
In the first and second high-density polyethylene<br>
layers, another polymer may be blended within the range of<br>
not impairing the objet of the present invention. Specific<br>
examples of the another polymer include polyethylene resins<br>
such as high-pressure low-density polyethylene and linear<br>
low-density polyethylene, polypropylene resins such as<br>
propylene homopolymier, propylene  a-olefin random copolymer<br>
and propylene  a-olefin block copolymer, various styrene-<br>
base elastomers such as styrene-butadiene elastomer,<br>
ethylene -.propylene elastomer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, copolymers of ethylene and (meth) acrylic acid<br>
(ester) , and olefin—base thermoplastic elastomers. The<br>
another polymer is blended for the purpose of, for example,<br>
adjusting the peel strength, at the marginal part of a<br>
medical container or at the easily separable partition part<br>
of a multiple chamber container.<br>
In the case of blending another polymer, the high-<br>
density polyethylene having a density of 0,950 g/cm3 or<br>
more is preferably contained in an amount of usually 20<br>
mass% or more, preferably 30 mass% or more, more preferably<br>
70 mass% or more,  still more preferably 90 mass% or more in<br><br>
WO 2004/071375                                                                                                          PCT/JP2004/001411<br>

each of the first and second high-density polyethylene<br>
layers. As long as the high-density polyethylene having a<br>
density of  0.950 g/cm3 or more is  contained in an amount  of<br>
20 mass% or more, heat sterilization at 1210C or more can<br>
be performed even when the first or second high-density<br>
polyethylene layer is provided, and moreover, the blocking<br>
resistance  of  film is  more  enhanced.<br>
The preferred thickness of each of the first and<br>
second high-density polyethylene layers varies depending on<br>
the high-density polyethylene content but when the high-<br>
density polyethylene is contained in an amount of 90 mass%<br>
or more,  the  thickness  is  preferably from  5 to 40  pm.<br>
The finally obtained medical contained is used by<br>
filling a medicament and then subjecting it to steam<br>
sterilization under high pressure. The steam sterilisation<br>
temperature is not particularly limited but this is<br>
generally from 100 to 140°C. Other known sterilization<br>
methods such as ultraviolet ray and electron beam can also<br>
be used in combination with the high-temperature high-<br>
pressure heat sterilization.<br>
The thus-obtained medical container is produced<br>
from a film or sheet comprising the above-described<br>
polyolefin-base resin composition and therefore, exhibits<br>
excellent property not only in the heat resistance but also<br>
in  all  of  the  transparency,  impact  resistance, flexibility<br><br>
