				<td>The invention relates to a liquid cooled mould for continuous casting of metals.<br>
Liquid cooled moulds for continuous casting of steel slabs are known from DE 197 16 450 A1, in which two long side walls facing each other, assembled out of a copper plate and a steel guard plate respectively, are provided,. The copper plates enclosing a mould cavity are fixed to the guard plates and are detachable by means of gudgeons. The gudgeons are welded to the copper plates. For this, a nickel ring is used additionally as filler metal. A localised heating takes place due to the welding of the gudgeons, which brings about unfavourable structural transformations at the welded joint. In addition, an inspection of the welded joint is necessary for the normally used stud welding process. If a gudgeon is damaged, it must be removed from the copper plate by a laborious process and replaced by a new one.<br>
Further, as per prior art, threaded inserts are introduced directly into a copper mould plate, so that the mould plate can be fixed to an adapter plate or a water reservoir by means of studs. However, in the case of mould plates of small wall thickness, the clear distance between the bottom of the bore for the screwed bush and the casting surface can be insufficient. Usually, a clear distance of about 6 to 25 mm is necessary in order to be able to rework the casting side. If the sum of the depth required for the screwing in of the screwed bushes and the distance between the bottom of the bore and the casting side required for the safe operation of the mould plates is more than the wall thickness of the mould plate, the only option that remains is to switch over to another less effective assembly method.<br>
EP 1 138 417 A1 reveals a liquid cooled plate mould for the continuous casting of metals, especially of steel materials, in which the mould plates are connected to a water reservoir and a guard plate respectively by means of fastening bolts. For this, the fastening bolts engage in the blank arranged on the water side of each mould plate, which are connected to the mould plate by soldered joints or by electron beam welding.<br>
2<br><br>
The disadvantage of this solution is that, as a rule, additional recesses must be provided in the water reservoir or in the adapter plate to receive the attachment fittings   projecting   from   the   coolant   side   of  the   mould   plate.   Further,   the supplementary coolant channels have to be placed in either the mould plate or the adapter plate.<br>
Proceeding from this, the problem of the invention is based upon improving a liquid cooled mould for continuous casting of metals with regard to the connection of copper mould plates, particularly of small wall thickness, to an adapter plate or to a water reservoir in such a way that a hydraulically favourable connection to the adapter plate or the water reservoir is possible.<br>
Moreover, an additional problem is seen in providing an especially wear-resistant mould, with thin-walled mould plates at the same time<br>
For solving the first problem, the invention proposes a mould with the features as described below. The essential components of the mould according to the invention are island-like platform bases protruding out of the mould plate, which project into a coolant slit formed between the mould plate and the adapter plate or the water reservoir. By this, the platform bases or the clearance spaces between the platform bases form a coolant slit of at least a certain height range. For sufficient flow rate, no additional grooves are necessary in the coolant side of the mould plate or the side of the adapter plate or the water reservoir turned towards the mould plate. The manufacturing cost for the production in the case of the solution according to the invention is thus less than in the case of solutions with expensive coolant management.<br>
The shape of the island-like platform bases is so selected that the resistance to the flow in the coolant slit is minimum. Hence, the platform bases have a streamlined shape adapted to the direction of flow of the coolant.<br>
3<br><br>
The mould according to the invention offers the advantage of a conventional detachable connection between the adapter plate or the water reservoir and the mould plate, especially if the fastening bolts are engaged in the threaded inserts fitted in the platform bases, even if extremely thin-walled mould plates are used. The height of the platform bases can be selected as a function of the height of the threaded inserts.<br>
The flow resistance is especially low if the platform bases are configured as diamond-shaped. But, low resistance values are obtained even when the platform bases are made tear-shaped or elliptical.<br>
It is considered especially advantageous, if the mould plate is supported on the adjoining adapter plate or the adjoining water reservoir over the platform base. In this case, no additional spacers are required for the formation of a coolant slit, since the platform base determines the distance between the mould plate and the adapter plate or the water reservoir and consequently also the width of the coolant slit. This has the advantage that basically no additional grooves or recesses have to be provided for the flow of the coolant in the adapter plate or the mould plate i.e. the adapter plate and the mould plate can be formed to be level at the coolant side, except for the platform bases, so that the manufacturing cost for the production of the additional coolant channels or grooves is basically avoided. Optionally, it is obvious that coolant channels or grooves can be provided both in the adapter plate as well as in the mould plate, at least area-wise.<br>
A further advantage of the mould plate of the invention is that, the elastic forces acting on the fastening bolts are transferred into the adapter plate or the water reservoir through the support of the platform base, directly adjacent to the through-hole, on to the adapter plate through the shortest possible path. This causes practically no bending moment in the mould plate.<br>
4<br><br>
The elastic forces arising in the fastening bolts are transferred into the mould plate optimally when the platform base has a transition region rounded towards the mould plate. This prevents undesirable notch stresses in the joining region of the platform bases.<br>
According to another embodiment, the platform bases are formed as a single unit with the mould plate. Here, the coolant side of the mould plate can be processed by milling to form the platform bases.<br>
It is also possible, according to the invention, to produce the platform bases as separate components and to join them with the mould plate afterwards. Integral joint processes, for example welding or soldering, are preferred  Joining  of   the platform bases with the mould plate can be considered for entirely different materials also.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mould plates have a wall thickness that is lesser than 2.5 times the diameter of the fastening bolts .<br>
The diameters of the fastening     bolts usually lie in the range of about 8 mm to about 20 mm.<br>
According to another embodiment, the coolant slit, carrying the fluid, is connected through coolant leads passing through the adapter plate. Since the coolant slit is finally connected with the coolant tank which is connected to the adapter plate via the coolant leads in the adapter plate, additional lateral coolant leads, as for example through the deep holes within the mould plate as per prior art, are not required. Especially, the coolant supply and withdrawal can take place totally via the adapter plate, which is provided with coolant entry and exit leads especially at regular intervals for this purpose, so that the desired cooling of the mould is achieved.<br>
5<br><br>
It is considered as especially advantageous according to the invention, if a mould plate of small wall thickness forms a shop-assembled plate assembly together with an adapter plate, which can be coupled, as a unit, with a water reservoir as such. It is possible to use this type of plate assemblies for substitution with mould blocks of the same total dimensions and connecting dimensions, due to the small wall thickness of the mould plate, integration of the coolant slit by the platform bases and with the direct coolant leads arranged in the adapter plate. The by     far large-dimensioned mould blocks of copper or a copper alloy can be replaced      totally and cost-effectively with plate assemblies of this type. The use of a plate assembly out of a mould plate and a reusable adapter plate is essentially more cost-effective than replacing a large mould block of copper or a copper alloy with a new one after it has reached its wear limit. In the case of the mould according to the invention, it is only necessary to replace the mould plate of small thickness with a new mould plate or to rework on the processing machines used so far. Advantageously, the mould plate has a constant wall thickness over its entire span.<br>
Mould plates consisting of a hardened copper material with an elongation limit of 300 MPa can be used, especially for achieving higher casting speeds and longer life.<br>
By using copper materials with higher elongation limit, it is possible to reduce the dimension of the wall thickness measured between the coolant slit and the casting side, which lies in the order of from about 5 mm to 25 mm, preferably 10 mm to 18 mm.<br>
The mould plate has a length of about 1.0 m to 1.5 m, preferably between 1.1 m and 1.4 m, according to the characteristic of claim 13 for using the mould according to the invention for high casting speeds, especially at casting speeds greater than 5 m/min.<br>
The platform bases can be arranged at a mutual distance of about 50 mm to 250 mm depending on the expected mechanical and thermal loads as well as the stiffness of the mould plate.<br>
6<br><br>
For easing the thermal stresses, it is intended, to incorporate a sliding guide between the surface of the platform bases and an adapter plate or a water reservoir, to enable a relative movement. Relative movements are those that occur in the plane of the contacting surface of the platform base and the adapter plate or the water reservoir. The sliding guide can be provided both at the adapter plate or the water reservoir and/or the surface of the platform base. The    sliding guide  can  be,  preferably,  a     polytetrafluoroethyiene  (PTFE)-based  coating. Sliding disks can also be used.<br>
For a relative movement between the mould plate and the adapter plate in the region of the connection, it is essential that the fastening bolts should permit such a relative movement. The subject of claim 18 is the type of fastening bolts , which basically have sufficient play in the through-holes in the adapter plate or the water reservoir. Further, it is also possible to provide similar sliding guides below a bolt head for securing the fastening bolts. These can be sliding disks or sliding coatings. The corresponding mating surfaces possess low static and/or sliding friction values, especially less than 0.1. A surface corresponding to the sliding guide can be, for example, chrome plated, polished or hardened for this purpose. It is also suggested to incorporate elements, which enable a relative movement of the studs against the components braced with each other, below the screw head. Here, for example, a spherical disk can be thought of, which is mounted in conical surfaces on one side or both sides. A double cone/sphere-combination enables a tilting movement with respect to each mating pair, by which a lateral relative movement of the stud is effected through the superimposition  of these tilting movements  in opposite directions.<br>
A similar effect that contributes favourably to facilitating the relative movement of the mould plate against the adapter plate or a water reservoir, namely because of the surfaces of the platform bases tying adjacent to the adapter plate or a water reservoir lying in planes parallel to each other, is achieved by another embodiment of the invention. Here, the fact that the respective platform bases arranged in the region of the camber, define another sliding plane with the surfaces running<br>
7<br><br>
tangential to the camber, is taken care of, particularly by the mould plates with aligned cambers shaped like a funnel. The sliding planes intersect as a result and prevent an unhindered relative movement of the mould plates. Sliding planes running parallel to each other solve this problem. Particularly, a defined elongation direction can be specified by the mutual alignment of the surfaces of the platform bases or the sliding planes formed by them without causing stresses of the mould plate against the adapter plate or the water reservoir.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the mould plate is provided with a diffusion barrier in the contact area with the steel melt that is thermally stressed to the maximum, particularly the upper region of the liquid metal-level. Diffusion barriers can be formed out of a metallic/metalloid material, but may also be made of lacquers, resins or plastics as well as ceramic materials. The diffusion barrier is preferably applied to the upper half of the mould plate. It can have a thickness of 0.002 mm to 0.3 mm, especially a thickness of 0.005 mm to 0.1 mm. The diffusion barrier can also be formed as a multi-layer coating with a covering layer of ceramic material. The covering layer serves the function of heat insulation. Preferably, the covering layer consists of an oxide-ceramic material, like aluminium oxide (Al203), zirconium oxide (ZrO2) or magnesium oxide (MgO).<br>
In addition, the mould plate can be provided with a wear-resistant coating in the casting direction below the liquid metal-level, whose thickness increases in the casting direction. Preferably, the lower half of the casting side of the mould plate is provided with a wear-resistant coating of that kind. Since thin-walled mould plates have lesser volume of metal which is worn away, it is considered as especially advantageous if the wear-resistant layer increases slightly in thickness in the casting direction, i.e. towards the lower end. Due to this, the wear-resistant coating is executed preferably wedge-shaped in cross-section. In a preferred embodiment, the layer thickness in this case can increase from about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm.<br>
8<br><br>
Nickel and nickel alloys can be used as coating materials for the wear-resistant coating. Spraying processes can also be used for the material application, like for example, the high velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF), wire flame spraying process or plasma spraying processes, alone or in combination. The coating materials applied by spraying processes can be, for example, WCCo or the already mentioned oxide-ceramics, like aluminium oxide (A12O3), zirconium oxide (ZrO2) or even materials based on NiCrB.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a liquid cooled mould for continuous casting of metals, comprising mould plates made of copper or a copper alloy, which are connected to an adapter plate or a water reservoir respectively by means of fastening bolts, characterised in that, the fastening bolts are fixed to island-like platform bases protruding from the coolant side of the mould plate, which project, at least partially, into a coolant silt formed between the mould plate and the adapter plate or the water reservoir and has a streamlined shape which is adapted to the direction of flow (S) of the coolant.<br>

Figure 1 shows, in the partial section, a mould plate 1, which is fixed to an adapter plate 2. The mould plate 1 and the adapter plate 2 form a plate assembly 3 of a liquid cooled mould, not shown in detail, for the continuous casting of metals. The plate assembly 3 is depicted here only up to half, in which the section plane passing in the right half of the drawing divides the plate assembly 3 approximately centrally. The mould plate 1 is made of a copper alloy or a hardened copper material, preferably with an elongation limit of 300 Mpa and has a constant wall thickness D over its entire span (Figure 5). The plate assembly 3 is planned for connection to a water reservoir, not shown in detail, whereby it can be coupled to the water reservoir via quick assembly unions. The plate assembly 3 is configured with such overall dimensions that the usual mould blocks of the same dimensions and connection dimensions can be replaced completely with the plate assembly 3, consisting of an adapter plate 2 out of a steel material and the relatively thin mould plate 1.<br>
The adapter plate 2, 2' is provided with coolant leads 4 for codling the mould plate 1 with coolant. Besides, the coolant reaches a coolant slit 5 (figure 2) formed between the mould plate 1 and the adapter plate 2 through the coolant leads 4. It will be clear from figure 2 that the coolant slit 5 is not housed in the adapter plate 2, but is fixed at its width B by island-like platform bases 7 protruding on the coolant side 6 of the mould plate 1. A possible shape of the platform bases 7 is brought out clearly from figure 3. The platform bases have essentially a diamond-shaped configuration with the sharp corners 8, 9 and the rounded corners 10, 11 lying opposite each other respectively. The platform base has a longer length in the direction of the sharp corners 8, 9 than in the direction of the rounded corners 10, 11. The sharp corners 8, 9 of the platform base 7 are hereby adapted to the direction of flow, clearly represented   by the arrow S. All together, in this way, the platform bases 7 possess a streamlined  shape. The platform bases 7 are formed in this embodiment with the mould plate 1. Further, the platform bases 7 have a rounded transition region 12 to the mould plate 1, in which the radius of the transition region 12 corresponds essentially to the height H of the platform base 7 in this embodiment. The height H of a platform base 7 is constant, so that the surface 13 of the platform 7 is made parallel to the coolant side 6 of the mould plate 1.<br>
10<br><br>
A fastening bolt 14 is fitted in each platform base 7 of the mould plate 1. For this purpose, a threaded insert 15 is fixed in the platform bases 7 first, into which the fastening bolt is screwed in. In the embodiment illustrated in figure 2, the fastening bolt 14 passes through a through-hole 16 in the adapter plate 2. The hexagon shaped bolt head 17 of the fastening bolt 14 supports itself on a washer 18 at the water reservoir side 19 of the adapter plate 2. The fastening bolt 14 is screwed-in perpendicular to the mould plate 1 in this embodiment. According to the invention, it is also possible to select another screwing-in angle to achieve a load-adapted fixing of the mould plate 1 to the adapter plate 2. That is, the screwing-in angle can deviate from 90°. For a flat fitting of the bolt head 17, additionally either the washer 18 can be made tapered or the water reservoir side 19 can be provided with corresponding tapered recesses.<br>
The fastening bolt 14 passes through through-hole 16 with play, so that, a thermally caused relative movement of the mould plate 1 against the adapter 2, in particular, is possible. For this, either the surface 13 of the platform base 7 and/or the side 20 of the adapter plate turned towards the adapter plate 2 is provided, at least locally, with a sliding guide, making a relative movement possible. The sliding guide can preferably be a coating with low coefficient of friction. This can, for example, be a potytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based material. The opposite surface which is in contact with the sliding guide has a corresponding surface prepared for the reduction of the static as well as the sliding friction. For example, surface areas can be locally polished, hardened or also coated, e.g. chrome plated.<br>
Sliding guides can also be incorporated in the form of sliding disks between the coolant plate and the adapter plate, these are not depicted in detail. The same measures are possible also on the water reservoir side 19 of the adapter plate 2 in the area of the supporting surface below the bolt head 17. If necessary, it can also be rendered by arranging a disk out of elastomeric material additionally, below the bolt head, not only to be able to ease relative movements in the direction of the coolant channels 15 in this way, but also to compensate for thermally-induced changes in the length in the direction of the fastening bolts.<br>
11<br><br>
The embodiment of figure 4 shows such a form of execution. In this case, a fastening bolt 14', which is shorter than that depicted in figure 2, including its bolt head 17' is introduced in a countersunk bore 21. Means for the easing of relative movements between the adapter plate 2' and the mould plate 1 are important, especially because of the reduced length of the fastening bolt 14'. A bolt head 17', which can be formed as a single unit with the fastening bolt 14', is used for this purpose for the embodiment of figure 4, so that the fastening bolt is configured as a screw. But the bolt head 17' can also be designed as a nut. The bolt head 17' has a broad collar 22, preferably made as a single unit, in the direction of the mould plate 1 in order to be able to take up axial forces optimally. If necessary, a large disk 23, formed integral with the bolt head 17', is provided below the collar 22, which is provided on one side with a sliding guide 24 in the form of a PTFE-coating. A sliding disk 25, with a surface appropriate to the PTFE-coating 24, is fitted here. The sliding disk 25 has a larger diameter than the coated disk 23 and is preferably chrome-plated, polished or hardened.<br>
Finally, an elastic ring-element 26 is incorporated below the sliding disk 25, over which the necessary prestress of the screw mounting can be applied. The elastic ring-element is, for example, a ring out of an elastomeric material, like, for example, rubber, or is formed out of one or more resilient elements. The elastic ring element 28 supports itself finally on the collar-like bottom 27 of the countersunk bore 21. In order to ensure a definite relative movement of the fastening bolt 14' within the through-hole 16' in the adapter plate 2, the external diameter of the disk 23 coated with sliding guide 24 is smaller than the external diameter of the limiting sliding disk 25. The diameters of the sliding disk 25 and the elastic ring-element are only slightly smaller than the diameter of the counterbore, so that the elastic force created by the fastening bolt 14' is transferred to the entire bottom of the bore 27. By this, on the one hand the local surface pressures are small and on the other hand the location of the sliding disk 25 is oriented against the PTFE-coated disk 23.<br>
It is clear from figures 1 and 5 that the platform bases 7 are uniformly distributed grid-like over the entire coolant side 6 of the mould plate 1. In this embodiment, the<br>
12<br><br>
platform bases 7 are arranged in rows and columns perpendicular to each other, in which their sharp corners 8, 9 are directed in the direction of flow S of the coolant, which in this embodiment corresponds to the casting direction X. The casting direction X and the direction of flow S can deviate from each other, e.g. even be arranged opposite.<br>
The mould plate 1 has a contour used usually in the continuous casting process with centric camber, in which its wall thickness D measured between the coolant side 6 and the casting side 28 is constant over its entire span. Only the platform bases 7, 7' protrude from the coolant side 8 like islands.<br>
In this type of execution, the platform bases 7, 7' have surfaces 13, 13', which are levelled parallel to the coolant side 6 of the mouid plate 1 directly surrounding them. If the coolant side 6 is curved, which is the case in the area of the camber, the surface 13' of the platform base 7' there can be levelled tangential to the curvature of the  camber.  That is, the platform bases 7,  7' are in  principle arranged perpendicular to the respective surface region of the coolant side 6.<br>
But it is also possible that all the surfaces 13, 13' of the platform bases 7, 7' are aligned parallel to each other. Then, the surfaces of the platform bases 7' of the camber are not arranged tangential to the coolant side 6, but include different angles with the coolant side 6 according to their positioning on the camber. The advantage is that all platform bases 7, 7' have a definite oriented direction of displacement, by which stresses in the mould plate 1 are further reduced.<br>
