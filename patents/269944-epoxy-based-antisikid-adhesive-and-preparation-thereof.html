The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an antiskid adhesive and a preparation method thereof, and more particularly to an epoxy-based antiskid adhesive and a preparation method thereof. <br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Conventional antiskid products including antiskid coatings, antiskid agents, and antiskid belts are widely used indoors but not suitable for outdoor environment, which means its application scope is very limited. A common antiskid method is to notch the substrate material to form an antiskid area or insert a copper bar after notching. However, the method destroys the surface of the substrate. Especially, notching or inserting causes the protective surface of the stone material to destroy when the antiskid area is formed in stone material surface, which may result in a series of stone diseases, and thereby the substrate is easy to fall off, the antiskid effect is bad, and the service life is short. Additionally, with daily decrease of metal resources, non-ferrous metals including copper is more and more expensive, so it is urgent to develop an antiskid product with low resource consumption.<br>
[0003]	Epoxy resin is a thermosetting synthetic resin having two or more active epoxy groups and with aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic carbon bond as the main chain and can be solidified with a variety of amine as curing agents. With advantages such as easy processing and high performance after being cured, epoxy resins have been widely used in adhesives. As an important material of membrane formation of heavy-duty coatings, epoxy resins have outstanding adhesion, good corrosion resistance, low cure shrinkage, temperature resistance, and chemical resistance, and can effectively resist the penetration of a variety of media. Furthermore, epoxy resins can be applied even in a harsh environment and meet the design requirement for coating thickness and structure. Epoxy resins can be made into anti-corrosion coatings by modifying epoxy structure, alloying epoxy, filling in inorganic fillers, and modifying expanding monomers. Epoxy coating has excellent physical and mechanical properties, such as adhesion, chemical resistance, oil resistance, particularly alkali resistance, and thereby epoxy resins can be widely used as the surface adhesive of stone, metal, cement, wood, and so on.<br>
[0004]	 The invention utilizes epoxy resins due to its widely application as adhesives and good adhesive propert and film forming property and adds quartz sand as antiskid compositions so as to produce a special double compositions (A, B) adhesive, namely the epoxy-based antiskid adhesive which can be cured at room temperature. And its construction method is as below: marking a slippery area with KEDA antiskid belts having thickness of between 1 and 2 mm, uniformly mixing the component A and component B (the ratio is 2:1), painting the mixture with a scraper on the marked area, removing excess adhesives, removing the antiskid belts 10 min later, allowing for curing for 12 hs at 25°C. 7 days later, the mechanical properties of the adhesive are stabilized. <br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	In order to overcome disadvantages of poor wear resistance, age resistance and indoor use of prior antiskid belts, it is one objective of the invention to provide an epoxy-based antiskid adhesive.<br>
[0006]	It is another objective of the invention to provide a method of preparation of the above epoxy-based antiskid adhesive.<br>
[0007]	To achieve the above objectives, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided an epoxy-based antiskid adhesive comprising component A and component B, wherein the component A comprises 20-35 parts of an epoxy resin, 0.5 -3 parts of a diluting agent, 1-5 parts of silica hydrated, 20-60 parts of quartz sand, 1-6 parts of quartz powder, 1-10 parts of an active calcium, and 1-5 parts of coarse whiting; and the component B comprises 20-40 parts of an organic compound-modified amine, 1-5 parts of an accelerator, 0-3 parts of a coupling agent,5-10 parts of silica hydrated, 20-50 parts of quartz sand, 1-10 parts of quartz powder; and 1-10 parts of silica fume.<br>

[0009]	In a class of this embodiment, the component A comprises 30 parts of the epoxy resin, 1 part of the diluting agent,3 parts of silica hydrated, 50 parts of quartz sand, 5 parts of quartz powder, 8 parts of an active calcium, and 3 parts of coarse whiting; and the component B comprises 30 parts of the organic compound-modified amine, 3 parts of the accelerator, 1 part of the coupling agent, 5 parts of silica hydrated, 45 parts of quartz sand, 10 parts of quartz powder, and 5 parts of silica fume.<br>
[0010]	In a class of this embodiment, the coupling agent is vinyl silane, ?-propyltrimethoxysilane, ?-aminopropyl triethoxysilane, anilinomethyltriethoxysilane, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0011]	In a class of this embodiment, the diluting agent is epoxypropane nonylether, propylene oxide C12-14, 5-(tridecyloxy)pentan-2-one, polyglycidyl ether, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0012]	In a class of this embodiment, the epoxy resin is an epoxy resin of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, an epoxy resin of bisphenol F diglycidyl ether epoxy resin, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0013]	In a class of this embodiment, the organic compound-modified amine is alicyclic amine, low molecular weight of polyamide, isophorone diamine, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0014]	In a class of this embodiment, the accelerator is 4-ethyl-1,6-dimethylpyridine, a,a'-diethyl dibenzylamine, 1,1,4-trimethyl-6-ethoxy-tetrahydroquinoline, 4-nonylphenol, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0015]	In a class of this embodiment, the quartz sand is between 40 and 100 mesh.<br>
[0016]	In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of preparation of an epoxy-based antiskid adhesive, which comprises component A and component B. The component A is produced by adding silica hydrated to a mixture of epoxy resin and diluting agent, uniformly dispersing, adding quartz sand, quartz powder, said active calcium, and coarse whiting at a speed of between 20 and 50 rpm, dispersing for 40 min, and uniformly mixing; and component B is produced by adding silica hydrated to a mixture of said accelerator, said coupling agent, and said organic compound-modified amine, uniformly dispersing, adding quartz sand, quartz powder, and silica fume at a speed of between 20 and 50 rpm, dispersing for 40 min, and uniformly mixing.The component A comprises 20-35 parts of an epoxy resin, 0.5 -3 parts of a diluting agent, 1-5 parts of silica hydrated, 20-60 parts of quartz sand, 1-6 parts of quartz powder, 1-10 parts of an active calcium, and 1-5 parts of coarse whiting; and the component B comprises 20-40 parts of an organic compound-modified amine, 1-5 parts of an accelerator, 0-3 parts of a coupling agent,5-10 parts of silica hydrated, 20-50 parts of quartz sand, 1-10 parts of quartz powder; and 1-10 parts of silica fume.<br>
[0017]	For the epoxy-based antiskid adhesive of the invention, the epoxy resin is a main ingredient. The silica hydrated enhances the sagging of the adhesive so as to form a fixed nonslip area. The quartz sand enhances the roughness of the product so as to form a nonslip surface. The quartz powder, active calcium, coarse whiting, and silica fume all as fillers enhance the mechanical strength. The organic compound-modified amine functions as a curing agent. The accelerator enhances the curing degree of the epoxy resin. The coupling agent is used to increase the compatibility of the epoxy resin and the fillers. The diluting agent can adjust the viscosity of the product so as to enhance the adhesive force between the product and a substrate and it is easy to be carried out.<br>
[0018]	Based on excellent corrosive resistance of epoxy resins, by modifying an epoxy group with various compounds, filling in inorganic compounds, and adding high-strength and wear-resistant quartz sand, an epoxy-based antiskid coating which can be cured at room temperature and has good adhesion and dimensional stability is formed. The antiskid adhesive can be widely used in outdoor or indoor stair steps, slopes, and entrance or exit of public places, and so on, and the substrate to be applied to is stone, cement, ceramics, wood, and so on.<br>
[0019]	The antiskid adhesive of the invention adheres to the substrate (such as, stone, cement, ceramics, wood) tightly by chemical bonding force, and the antiskid surface is rough, the antiskid effect is excellent. Furthermore, the raw material of epoxy resin is rich in supply, which reduces the waste of non-renewable resources.<br>
[0020]	Advantages of the invention are summarized below: the antiskid adhesive has long service life and high adhesive force, is easy for practice, solvent-free, environmentally friendly, and can be widely used indoors and outdoors.<br>
[0021]	Tests on the epoxy-based antiskid adhesive of the invention show it has excellent properties such as wear resistance, hot-wet resistance, UV age resistance, and resistance of hot and cold alternation. The addition of a coupling agent such as?-aminopropyl triethoxysilane which has two active groups of amino group and ethoxy group and couples organic polymers and inorganic filler improves the adhesion, strength, moisture resistance, weather resistance, and extends the service life.<br>
[0022]	Tests on the epoxy-based antiskid adhesive of the invention further show that a mixture of bisphenol A epoxy resin and bisphenol F epoxy resin significantly enhances the comprehensive properties such as tensile strength, flexural strength, and water absorption, particularly when bisphenol F epoxy resin accounts for between 40 and 60 weight%, and thereby the low-temperature crystallization of bisphenol A epoxy resin is avoided. Additionally, alicyclic glycidyl ether epoxy resin, due to its good adhesion, weather resistance, heat resistance, and age resistance, is particularly suitable for places where resistance of hot and cold alternation is a must. In a time when the temperature dropped significantly, especially in a wet construction environment, alicyclic amine as a curing agent is prone to pale and frost, an appropriate choice for the amount and type of an accelerator can weaken the phenomenon. Test still shows although the accelerator speeds up the reaction rate and avoids many side reactions, it will significantly reduce the storage period of basic materials.<br>
[0023]	The properties such as antiskid effect and wear resistance of the epoxy-based antiskid adhesive of the invention is decided by a variety of factors including but not limited to the type of the epoxy resin and the curing agent, the adhesion thereof, the type of the fillers, the molecular weight and molecular structure of the selected materials.<br>
