The compounds of formula (I) may comprise one or more asymmetric carbon atoms.<br>
They may thus exist in the form of enantiomers or diastereoisomers. These enantiomers<br>
and diastereoisomers, and also mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of<br>
the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in the form of bases or of acid-addition salts.<br>
Such addition salts form part of the invention.<br>
These salts are advantageously prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, but the<br>
salts of other acids that are useful, for example, for purifying or isolating the compounds<br>
of formula (I) also form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be in the form of hydrates or solvates, i.e. in<br><br>
the form of associations or combinations with one or more water molecules or with a<br>
solvent. Such hydrates and solvates also form part of the invention.<br>
In the text hereinbelow, the term "leaving group" means a group that can be readily<br>
cleaved from a molecule by breaking a heterolytic bond, with loss of an electron pair. This<br>
group may thus be readily replaced with another group, for example during a substitution<br>
reaction. Such leaving groups are, for example, halogens or an activated hydroxyl group<br>
such as a methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, triflate, acetate, etc.<br>
Examples of leaving groups and references for preparing them are given in "Advances in<br>
Organic Chemistry", J. March, 5th Edition, Wiley Interscience, 2001.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared<br>
according to the process illustrated in scheme 1 below.<br>
According to scheme 1, the compounds of general formula (IV) may be obtained by<br>
reacting a compound of general formula (II) in which X1t X2, X3 and X* are as defined in<br>
the general formula (I) above and B represents a C1-C6-alkoxy or hydroxyl group, with a<br>
compound of general formula (III), in which Z1t Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5 and n are as defined in the<br>
general formula (I) above and R' represents a bromine or iodine atom, a tosylate group or<br>
any other leaving group.<br>
When n = 1, 2 or 3, the compound of general formula (III) may be an alkyl halide, such as<br>
a benzyl bromide (n = 1: Kolasa T., Bioorg.Med.Chem. 1997, 5 (3) 507) or a phenethyl<br>
iodide (n = 2: Abramovitch R., Synth. Commun., 1995, 25 (1), 1), and the reaction may be<br>
performed in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or potassium carbonate, in<br>
a polar solvent such as dimethyiformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or acetone.<br><br><br><br>
When n = 0, the compound of general formula (III) is an aryl iodide or bromide and the<br>
reaction may be performed at a temperature of between 80°C and 250°C, in the presence<br>
of a copper-based catalyst such as copper bromide or copper oxide and also a base such<br>
as potassium carbonate (Murakami Y., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1995, 43 (8), 1281). The<br>
milder conditions described in S.L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 11684 may<br>
also be used.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (IV), in which n = 0, may be obtained by<br>
reacting the compound of general formula (II) with a compound of general formula (III) of<br>
boronic acid type (n = 0, R' = B(OH)2), in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or<br>
pyridine and also copper diacetate, by analogy with protocols described in<br>

The compounds of general formula (II) are commerically available or prepared according<br>
to many processes described in the literature (for example D. Knittel Synthesis 1985, 2,<br>
186; T.M. Williams J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36 (9), 1291; JP2001151771A2).<br>
In the case of the indoles of general formula (IV), in which B represents a C^Ce-alkoxy<br>
group, the compound of general formula (I) is obtained by reacting a compound of<br>
general formula (IV), as obtained above, with an amide of the compound of general<br>
formula (V), in which W is as defined in the general formula (I) above, at the reflux point<br>
of a solvent such as toluene. The amide of the compound of general formula (V) is<br>
prepared by the prior action of trimethylaluminium on the amines of general formula (V).<br>
In the case of the indoles of general formula (IV), in which B represents a hydroxyl group,<br>
the carboxylic acid function may be converted beforehand into an acid halide such as an<br>
acid chloride via the action of thionyl chloride, at the reflux point of a solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane or dichloroethane. The compound of general formula (I) is then obtained<br>
by reacting the compound of general formula (IV), in which B represents a chlorine atom,<br>
with the compound of general formula (V), in the presence of a base such as<br>
triethylamine or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the indole of general formula (IV), in which B represents a hydroxyl group,<br>
may be coupled with the compound of general formula (V) in the presence of a coupling<br>
agent such as a dialkyl carbodiimide, benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(pyrrolidinophosphonium)<br>
hexafluorophosphate, diethyl cyanophosphonate or any other coupling agent known to<br>
those skilled in the art, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, in a solvent such<br>
as dimethylformamide.<br>
In scheme 1, the compounds of formula (II), (III) and (V) and the other reagents, when<br>

and/or Zs represent a group -S(O)-alkyl or -S(O)2-alkyl, may be obtained by oxidation of<br>
the corresponding compounds of general formula (II), (IV) or (I), in which X1, X2, X3, X4,<br>
Zy, Z2, Z3, Z4 and/or Z5 represents a C1-C6-thioalkyl group, according to methods that are<br>
described in the literature or that are known to those skilled in the art.<br>

and/or Z5 represent a group NR.,R2, NR3C0R4 or NR3SO2R5, may be obtained from the<br>

acylation or sulfonylation, according to methods that are described in the literature or that<br>

described in Pharmazie 1990, 45, 346, or according to methods that are described in the<br>
literature or that are known to those skilled in the art.<br>

The compounds of the invention were subjected to in vitro and in vivo pharmacological<br>
tests that demonstrated their value as substances with therapeutic activities.<br>
Test of inhibition of the current induced with capsaicin on rat DRGs<br>
-	Primary culture of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells:<br>
The neurons of the DRG naturally express the TRPV1 receptor.<br>
The primary cultures of newborn rat DRGs are prepared using 1-day-old rats. Briefly,<br>
after dissection, the ganglions are trypsinized and the cells dissociated by mechanical<br>
trituration. The cells are resuspended in an Eagle basal culture medium containing 10%<br>
foetal calf serum, 25 mM KCI, 2 mM glutamine, 100 //g/ml gentamicin and 50 ng/ml of<br>
NGF, and then deposited on glass slides coated with laminin (0.25 x 106 cells per slide),<br>
which are then placed in Corning 12-well dishes. The cells are incubated at 37°C in a<br>
humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02 and 95% air. Cytosine 3-D-arabinoside (1 //M)<br>
is added 48 hours after culturing, to prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells. The slides<br>
are transferred into experimental chambers for the patch-clamp studies after 7-10 days of<br>
culturing.<br>
-	Electrophysiology<br>
The measuring chambers (volume 800 //I) containing the cell preparation are placed on<br>
the platform of an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2) equipped with Hoffman optics<br>
(Modulation Contrast, New York) and observed at a magnification of 400X. The<br>
chambers are continuously gravity-influxed (2.5 ml/min) using a solution distributor<br>
accepting 8 inlets and whose sole outlet, consisting of a polyethylene tube (aperture<br>
500 //m), is placed less than 3 mm from the cell under study. The "whole cell"<br>
configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used. The borosilicate-glass pipettes<br>
(resistance 5-10 MOhms) are brought to the cell by means of a 3D piezoelectric<br>
micromanipulator (Burleigh, PC1000). The overall currents (membrane potential set at<br>
-60 mV) are recorded with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster city,<br>
California), connected to a PC running the Pclamp8 software (Axon Instrument). The<br>
current plots are recorded on paper and simultaneously digitized (sampling frequency 15<br>
to 25 Hz) and acquired on the hard drive of the PC.<br>
The application of a 300 nM capsaicin solution induces on the DRG cells (voltage set at<br>
-70 mV) an entering cationic current. In order to minimize the desensitization of the<br>
receptors, a minimum interval of 1 minute between two applications of capsaicin is<br>
observed. After a control period (stabilization of the capsaicin response alone), the test<br>
compounds are applied alone at a given concentration (concentration of 10 nM or 1 nM)<br>
for a time of 4 to 5 minutes, during which several capsaicin + compound tests are<br><br>
performed (to obtain the maximum inhibition). The results are expressed as a percentage<br>
of inhibition of the control capsaicin response.<br>
The percentages of inhibition of the capsaicin response (300 nM) are between 20% and<br>
100% for the most active antagonist compounds of the invention tested at a<br>
concentration of 10 nM or 1 nM (see selected examples in Table 2).<br><br>
The intrinsic agonist effect of the compounds may be evaluated by measuring the<br>
current induced at various compound concentrations on the rat DRG, in the presence or<br>
absence of capsazepine.<br>
Test of mouse corneal irritation<br>
The irritant nature of capsaicin is readily assessed on the cornea since this organ is one<br>
of the organs most densely innervated with C fibres. In this context, from preliminary<br>
experiments, the application of a very small amount of capsaicin (2 //I at a concentration<br>
of 160 //M) to the surface of the cornea of an animal leads to a certain number of<br>
stereotypic behavioural traits associated with irritation, which are easy to detect. Among<br>
these, the following are noted: blinking of the eye, rubbing of the instilled eye with the<br>
ipsilateral front paw, rubbing of the face with both front paws, scratching of the ipsilateral<br>
face with the hind paw. The duration of this behaviour does not exceed the 2 minutes of<br>
observation, and the animal then resumes its normal activity. This aspect is moreover<br>
also normal. The mouse is not recluse in a corner with raised hackles and does not<br>
develop any observable sign of suffering. It may be concluded that the duration of action<br>
of capsaicin at these doses is less than 2 minutes.<br>
Summary of the methodology:<br>
The principle of the series of experiments is to determine whether the compounds of the<br>
invention can influence the behavioural response induced with a given amount of<br>
capsaicin. The capsaicin is initially diluted to 25 mM in DMSO and diluted, for its final<br>
use, in Tween 80 to 10% in physiological saline. It appears, from control studies, that,<br>
under these conditions, the solvent has no effect.<br><br>
In practice, the test product is administered orally and, with a delay (pretreatment time: t)<br>
that depends on the pharmacokinetic data, the animal receives an ocular instillation of<br>
2 JJ\ of a 160 //M capsaicin solution prepared as indicated above. During a 2-minute<br>
observation following the instillation, the number of times the instilled eye is rubbed with<br>
5 the ipsilateral front paw is recorded.<br>
For a given animal, the percentage of protection is calculated as follows:<br>
P= 100 - ((number of scratching actions observed/mean number of scratching actions<br>
for the group treated with the solvent) x 100)<br>
This percentage of protection is averaged for each group of animals (n = number of<br>
) animals tested with the compound of the invention).<br>
The percentages of protection evaluated in this model for the most active compounds of<br>
the invention, used at a dose of 1 mg/kg (po), are between 20% and 100% (see selected<br>
examples in Table 3):<br><br>
The results of these tests show that the compounds may have agonist or antagonist<br>
effects on the TRPV1 receptor. The most active antagonist compounds of the invention<br>
block the effects induced by stimulation of the TRPV1 receptors.<br>
The compounds of the invention may thus be used for the preparation of medicaments,<br>
especially for the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating pathologies in<br>
which the TRPV1 receptors are involved.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicaments that<br>
comprise a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or<br>
alternatively a hydrate or a solvate of the said compound.<br>
These medicaments find therapeutic use especially in the prevention and/or treatment of<br>

treatment), (osteo)arthritic pain, rheumatic pain, fibromyalgia, back pain, cancer-related<br>
pain, facial neuralgia, headaches, migraine, dental pain, burns, sunburn, animal bites or<br>
insect bites, post-herpetic neuralgia, muscular pain, trapped nerves (central and/or<br><br>
peripheral), spinal column and/or brain trauma, ischaemia (of the spinal column and/or<br>
the brain), neurodegeneration, haemorrhagic strokes (of the spinal column and/or of the<br>
brain) and post-stroke pain.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used for the preparation of a medicament for<br>
preventing and/or treating urological disorders such as hyperactivity of the bladder,<br>
vesical hyperreflexia, vesical instability, incontinence, urgent micturition, urinary<br>
incontinence, cystitis, nephritic colic, pelvic hypersensitivity and pelvic pain.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used to prepare a medicament for preventing<br>
and/or treating gynaecological disorders, for instance vulvodynia and pain associated<br>
with salpingitis or with dysmenorrhoea.<br>
These products may also be used for the preparation of a medicament for preventing<br>
and/or treating gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrooesophageal reflux disorder,<br>
stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers, functional dyspepsia, colitis, IBS, Crohn's disease,<br>
pancreatitis, oesophagitis and biliary colic.<br>
Similarly, the products of the present invention may be useful in the prevention and/or<br>

bronchoconstriction and inflammatory disorders. These products may also be used for<br>
preventing and/or treating psoriasis, pruritus, dermal, ocular or mucous irritation, herpes<br>
and zona.<br>
