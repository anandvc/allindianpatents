METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR OPERATION OF A COMPUTER NETWoRK INTENDED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF CONTENT<br>
This invention relates -to the domain of Informtion and Communication Technologies.<br>
This invention is most particularly related to the domain of content publication.<br>
Prior art has already disclosed an elect -onic multimedia data publishing system as described in p itent application PCT WO 01/95147 (STG Interactive SA) , comprising a server connected to a computer network and a number of host terminals connected to the computer network, the server including a database where in are stored digital files containing descriptors of multimedia pages and a software program which manages the data base and exchanges with the host terminals, the host termLinals being equipped with a random access memory to tempoiarily store digital files downloaded from the server da1 abase and a consultation program to visually display files in accordance with descriptors of a downloaded page, wherein selected digital files include descriptors with at least two visual display modes of the same digital file.<br>
The FSDL (Frogans Slide Description Languag ) is also a well known easy-to-use XML language that can be used to develop and publish content and manipulate Frogans type computer objects (registered trademark of STG Interactive SA).<br>
One fundamental technical problem in the implementation and management of a computer network is to identify the topology of servers and lookup of addresses.<br>
The conventional DNS (Domain Name System has demonstrated its reliability and robustness over many years. However, this system is not designed so that<br><br>
advanced functions can easily be added to it, particularly concerning descriptions of content and heir accessibility- Its main function is the lookup of addresses.<br>
This invention is intended to overcome the disadvantages of prior art by proposing a technical mmethod for the operation of a computer network that is particularly suitable for the publication of conten . and particularly consulting of computer objects. This IT ithod and the associated system have many advantages coreared •with what is known in prior art. In particular the mmethod according to the invention has many advanced functions.<br>
Although systems for publication of conventional digital files (for example of Web type) have a free, obscure and almost anarchic organization, the it mmethod according to the invention provides a means of obtaining clear referencing and precise naming of the content. The use of a computer network using the mmethod according to the invention enables distributors to have better control over the content that they publish, and distribution of this content- For example, a user could access a descriptive file of a content before loading this ccntent from the server to his specific consultation prc gram, which helps to optimize network resources.<br>
At least three levels of very important adva3 tages of this invention can be immediately distinguished:<br>
•   User access<br>
Descriptors can be used for example to indicate whether or not the content is on line, whether or not a filter is present to protect minors from a c ntent specifically aimed at adults, and the mmethod by which the<br><br>
users  should authenticate  themselves  to  access  the content.<br>
•	Connection to the server<br>
For example, descriptors can be used to indicat the connection protocol (http...) and the reference file ( ome-slide).<br>
•	Format of content<br>
For example, descriptors can be used to indicat * the version of the publication language used and the enc &gt;ding format•<br>
Furthermore, the mmethod according to the invention can be used for optimized management of a cache in &gt;rder to reduce network traffic and improve access time.<br>
Thus, the mmethod according to the inventic n is extremely pleasant for an end-user: it is very si npler very coherent, very ergonomic and does not require any complex technical parameter settings. The inventior also has many advantages for the network administrator: ie is less in demand by users, so he can focus on more interesting and high level tasks. The m twork administrator benefits significantly from the inv* ation in terms of productivity, performances and work satisfaction.<br>
The invention also provides a rights manager with control over computer network operators. The ights manager delegates the possibility of managing a n
The mmethod according to the invention also pr &gt;vides a means of obtaining the signature of all co iputer network operation functions, while conventionally it is<br><br>
only possible  to  obtain  the  signature  of  co itent published through a computer network.<br>

Finally, this invention also relates to a computer network operating system, the said network compiLsing firstly a number of computer servers and at leas one client station on which specific software is installed for consulting digital pages, and connecting at least two distinct entities: a rights manager and at leas . one network operator.<br>
The invention will be better understood after reading the following purely explanatory descriptin of one embodiment of the invention with reference to the attached Drawings:<br>
* Drawing 1 illustrates an example of a system using the mmethod according to the invention; and<br><br>
•	Drawings 2 and 3 are diagrams represei ting<br>
document exchange flows between the rights manage *, a<br>
network operator and the specific software on the user<br>
station.<br>
The mmethod according to the invention is implemented in the system illustrated in Drawing 1. A specific software for consulting the content is installed on a client station. Information exchanges are made be ween this software and different servers. This arrangement is not the only possible arrangement: different functions can be located on a single server* The final objecti 'e is the consultation of content hosted on a dedicated server, this consultation being dependent of the address parameters and being made using the said specific software installed on the client station.<br>
In Drawing 1, the "C-RA" indicator means tha the document is signed by the root key and the "C-RE" indicator means that the document is signed by the network key.<br>
In our example embodiment, the digital certificate required to initialize a network includes the following fields:<br>
•	the name of the computer network<br>
•	a unique identifier<br>
•	a relative validity duration<br>
•	an expiration date<br>
•	the operator's name<br>
•	the operator's address<br>
•	the type,  description,  reference,  expilation<br>
date and license supplier,<br>
•	an URL leadind to a Web help site<br>
•	colors of the addresses and of the address<br>
background of the computer network<br><br>
•	locations  of  "certificate",  "topology"  and<br>
"status" digital documents<br>
•	the length and exponent of the public key (for<br>
an RSA type encryption)<br>
•	the public part of the network key and a "heck<br>
print" of this key<br>
and finally a signature of the document by the root key.<br>
In our example embodiment, the lookup file (address lookup) includes the following fieldsi<br>
•	the name of the computer network<br>
•	a digital identifier<br>
•	a relative validity duration<br>
•	an expiration date<br>
•	an address of the content to be published<br>
•	a flag whether or not the content is on line<br>
•	an indication of a filter (for example: content<br>
exclusively for adults or not)<br>
•	an address expiration date<br>
•	an indication about the user's authentication<br>
mmethod<br>
•	a descriptor of the connection protocol<br>
•	the location of the content<br>
•	the location of a reference slide (home, sids)<br>
•	the  version  and  encoding  of  the  content<br>
publication language<br>
•	indications about whether the content by longs<br>
tx&gt; thematic channels; groups, families, etc.<br>
and finally a signature of the document by  the network key*<br><br>
The possible step to update the specific softwa: e on the client station involves two digital documents: the status document and the update document.<br>
The status digital document (status) lists active versions of the software and the update digital document (update) contains the most recent version of the software.<br>
Three different statuses can be assigned in the status file:<br>
-	up to date (OK)<br>
-	expiration date is near (update recommended}<br>
-	obsolete (update necessary).<br>
When an address of the network, is re-opened from a the specific software, only certain steps will be executed depending on whether or not the certificate has expired, whether or not the topology has expired and then whether or not the lookup has expired in the cache.<br>
Tables I and II indicate "who signs what document, and using which key" in two cases: the general case with delegation and the case without delegation.<br>
Table I: Signature of digital documents in the general case: with delegation<br><br><br><br>
Drawings 2 and 3 show document exchange flows between servers hosting these documents and the user station, in the case of a public network and then in the case of a private network. Obviously, many other arrangements would be possible, for example some flows could be separated.<br>
In Drawings 2 and 3, flow reference 1 is the flow of the set-up and certificate documents, flow reference 2 is the flow of the topology and lookup I error document 3 and flow reference 3 is the flow of status and up date documents <br><br>
The above description of the invention is given  as an example. Obviously, those skilled in the art would be capable of making different variants of the invertion without going outside the scope of the patent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
