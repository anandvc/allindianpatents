				<td>PRODUCTION OF TITANIA<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing titania from a titaniferous material.<br>
The term "titaniferous" material is understood<br>
herein to mean any titanium-containing material, including<br>
by way of example ores, ore concentrates, and titaniferous<br>
slags.<br>
The present invention relates particularly to the<br>
sulfate process for producing titania from titaniferous<br>
material.<br>
The sulfate process was the first commercial<br>
process for the manufacture of titania from titaniferous<br>
ores, such as ilmenite.<br>
A significant issue with the sulfate process is<br>
that it produces large quantities of waste iron sulfate<br>
and consumes large quantities of sulfuric acid.<br>
The chloride process generally avoids the iron<br>
sulfate waste problem of the sulfate process and, at<br>
larger scales, is less expensive to operate than the<br>
sulfate process.<br>
Hence, the chloride process is the currently<br>
preferred process for producing titania, particularly<br>
titania for the pigment industry.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an improved sulfate process.<br>
In general terms, the present invention provides<br>
a sulfate process for producing titania from a<br>
titaniferous material (such as ilmenite) which includes<br>
the steps of:<br>
(a) leaching the titaniferous material with a<br>
leach solution containing sulfuric acid and forming a<br>
leach liquor that includes an acidic solution of titanyl<br>
sulfate (TiOSO4) and iron sulfate (FeSO4) ;<br>
(b) separating the leach liquor and a residual<br>
solid phase from the leach step (a) ;<br>
(c) precipitating iron sulfate from the leach<br>
liquor from step (b) and separating precipitated iron<br>
sulfate from the leach liquor;<br>
(d) extracting titanyl sulfate from the leach<br>
liquor from step (c) with a solvent and thereafter<br>
stripping titanyl sulfate from the solvent and forming a<br>
solution that contains titanyl sulfate;<br>
(e) using at least part of a raffinate from<br>
solvent extraction step (c) as at least part of the leach<br>
solution in the leach step (a);<br>
(f) hydrolysing the solution that contains<br>
titanyl sulfate and forming hydrated titanium oxides from<br>
the titanyl sulfate;<br>
(g) separating a solid phase containing<br>
hydrated titanium oxides and a liquid phase that are<br>
produced in the hydrolysis step (f); and<br>
(h) calcining the solid phase from step (g) and<br>
forming titania.<br>
The term "hydrated titanium oxides' is understood<br>
herein to include, by way of example, compounds that have<br>
the formula T1O2H20 and<br>
In addition, the term "hydrated titanium oxides"<br>
is understood herein to include compounds that are<br>
described in technical literature as titanium hydroxide<br>
(Ti(OH)4).<br>
The above-described process is characterised by<br>
step (e) of using the depleted leach liquor from the<br>
solvent extraction step (d)/ ie the raffinate, as the<br>
leach solution for leach step (a). This is a considerable<br>
advantage of the process because it maximises the<br>
effective use of acid in the process.<br>
Furthermore/ the use of the depleted leach liquor<br>
allows a reduction or complete elimination of the<br>
production of waste acidic effluents and/or their<br>
neutralisation products, such as "brown gypsum".<br>
Furthermore, the use of the depleted leach liquor<br>
allows recuperation of heat and also eliminates energy<br>
intensive acid recovery and evaporative concentration<br>
steps.<br>
Another advantage of the process is that<br>
precipitation of iron sulfate can be confined to one step<br>
only, namely iron sulfate precipitation step (c). This<br>
simplifies downstream processing of the iron sulfate and,<br>
in the context of step (e) of using the solvent extraction<br>
raffinate in leach step (a) is important in terms of<br>
controlling the concentration of iron in the circuit.<br>
Another, although not the only other, advantage<br>
of the process is that solvent extraction step (d) does<br>
not extract species (such as iron, chromium, manganese,<br>
and niobium) that are in solution in the leach liquor that<br>
could contaminate downstream products and thereby affect<br>
adversely the commercial worth of these products.<br>
In particular, the solvent extraction step makes<br>
it possible to produce titania, ie the main downstream<br>
product of interest, of very high purity, ie at least 99<br>
wt%.<br>
Preferably the process includes a further leach<br>
step of leaching the residual solid phase from step (b)<br>
with a leach solution containing sulfuric acid and forming<br>
a leach liquor that includes an acidic solution of titanyl<br>
sulfate and iron sulfate and a solid residual phase.<br>
The leach step {a} and the further leach step may<br>
be carried out in the same vessel.<br>
In that event, the further leach step includes<br>
returning the residual solid phase from step (b) to the<br>
vessel, wherein the residual solid phase forms part of the<br>
titaniferous material subjected to leaching in step (a).<br>
Alternatively, the leach step (a) and the further<br>
leach step may be carried out in separate vessels, with<br>
the residual solid'phase from step (b) being supplied to<br>
the separate vessel or vessels.<br>
In that event, preferably the further leach step<br>
includes separating the leach liquor and a further<br>
residual solid phase formed in the further leach step.<br>
The separated leach liquor may be supplied to the<br>
leach step (a).<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, the separated<br>
leach liquor may be mixed with the leach liquor from step<br>
(b) and thereafter the mixed leach liquor may be processed<br>
in the subsequent steps of the process.<br>
Preferably step (e) includes using at least part<br>
of the raffinate from solvent extraction step (d) as at<br>
least part of the leach solution in the further leach<br>
step.<br>
Preferably the further leach step includes<br>
leaching the residual solid phase from step (b) with the<br>
raffinate and make-up fresh sulfuric acid.<br>
Preferably the raffinate from the solvent<br>
extraction step (d) has an acid concentration of at least<br>
250 g/1 sulfuric acid.<br>
Preferably the raffinate from the solvent<br>
extraction step (d). has an acid concentration of at least<br>
350 g/1 sulfuric acid.<br>
The leach step (a) and/or the further leach step<br>
may be carried out on a continuous basis or a. batch basis.<br>
The applicant has found in experimental work that<br>
it is important to carry out the leach step (a) and/or the<br>
further leach step under leach conditions, described<br>
herein, that avoid an undesirable amount of premature<br>
hydrolysis of hydrated titanium oxides.<br>
In addition, the applicant has found in<br>
experimental work that it is important to carry out the<br>
leach step (a) and/or the further leach step under leach<br>
conditions that avoid an undesirable amount of premature<br>
precipitation of titanyl sulfate.<br>
Preferably the leach step (a) and/or the further<br>
leach step includes selecting and/or controlling the leach<br>
conditions in the leach step or steps to avoid undesirable<br>
amounts of premature hydrolysis of hydrated titanium<br>
oxides and undesirable amounts of premature precipitation<br>
of titanyl sulfate.<br>
The relevant leach conditions include any one or<br>
more than one of acid concentration, leach temperature and<br>
leach time.<br>
Typically, the acid concentration in the leach<br>
step (a) and/or the further leach step should be at least<br>
350 g/1 sulfuric acid throughout the leach step (a) and/or<br>
the further leach step when operating at a leach<br>
temperature in the range of 95°C to the boiling point in<br>
order to avoid premature hydrolysis.<br>
Typically, the acid concentration at the end of<br>
the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step should be<br>
less than 450 g/1 when operating at a leach temperature in<br>
the range of 95°C to the boiling point in order to avoid an<br>
undesirable amount of premature precipitation of titanyl<br>
sulfate.<br>
It is noted that the acid concentration at the<br>
start of the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step<br>
could be higher, typically as high as 700 g/1.<br>
Typically, the leach conditions should be<br>
selected and/or controlled so that the titanium ion<br>
concentration in the leach liquor is less than 50 g/1 in<br>
the leach liquor at the end of the leach step (a) and/or<br>
the further leach step.<br>
Preferably the titanium ion concentration in the<br>
leach liquor is 40-50 g/1.<br>
Preferably the process includes carrying out the<br>
leach step (a) in the presence of an additive that<br>
accelerates the rate of leaching the titaniferous<br>
material.<br>
Preferably the process includes carrying out the<br>
further leach step in the presence of an additive that<br>
accelerates the rate of leaching the titaniferous<br>
material.<br>
The use of the leaching accelerant makes it<br>
possible to use less concentrated sulfuric acid than is<br>
required for the conventional sulfate process.<br>
Preferably the leaching accelerant is selected<br>
from a group that, includes iron, a titanium (XXX) salt, a<br>
thiosulfate salt, sulfur dioxide or any other reduced<br>
sulfur containing species.<br>
Preferably the process includes carrying out the<br>
leach step (a) in the presence of a reductant that reduces<br>
Cerric ions to ferrous ions in the acidic solution of<br>
titanyl sulfate and iron sulfate produced in the leach<br>
step (a) .<br>
Preferably the process includes carrying out the<br>
further leach step in the presence of a reductant that<br>
reduces ferric ions to ferrous ions in the acidic solution<br>
of titanyl sulfate and iron sulfate produced in the leach<br>
step (a).<br>
The reductant may be any suitable reductant.<br>
Preferably the reductant is selected from a group<br>
that includes iron, a titanium (III) salt, a thiosulfate<br>
salt, sulfur dioxide or any other reduced sulfur<br>
containing species.<br>
As is indicated above, the purpose of the<br>
reductant is to minimise the amount of iron in the<br>
trivalent ferric form and to maximise the amount of iron<br>
in. the divalent ferrous form in the leach liquor produced<br>
in the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step.<br>
Maximising the amount of iron in the divalent ferrous form<br>
minimises the equilibrium concentrations of iron in the<br>
circuit, by promoting the precipitation of ferrous<br>
sulfate, for example FeSO4.7H2O.<br>
Preferably the solvent extraction step (d)<br>
includes contacting the leach liquor with the selected<br>
solvent including a modifier.<br>
The terra "solvent" is understood herein to mean a<br>
reagent and a diluent in combination.<br>
The term ."modifier" is understood herein to mean<br>
a chemical which changes the solubilising properties of<br>
the solvent such that the titanium containing species are<br>
soluble in the solvent at higher concentrations than might<br>
otherwise be possible.<br>
Preferably the process includes controlling the<br>
hydrolysis step (f) to produce a selected particle size<br>
distribution of the hydrated titanium oxides product.<br>
The controlled growth of coarse particles of<br>
hydra ted titanium oxides in the hydrolysis step (f) is a<br>
significant departure from the conventional sulfate<br>
process in which there is a strong preference for<br>
producing fine particles in order to produce fine titania<br>
that meets the needs of the pigment industry, the major<br>
user of titania.<br>
There are some applications, such as<br>
electrochemical reduction of titania, in which it is<br>
preferable to have a coarse feed of hydrated titanium<br>
oxides or a coarse feed of titania.<br>
For these applications, preferably the process<br>
includes controlling the hydrolysis step (f) to produce<br>
coarse hydrated titanium oxides, ie oxides having a<br>
particle size of at least 0.005-0.Olmm (ie 5-10 micron).<br>
Equally, there are other applications, such as<br>
production of pigments, in which it is preferable to have<br>
a fine feed of hydrated titanium oxides or a fine feed of<br>
titania.<br>
For these applications, preferably the process<br>
includes controlling the hydrolysis step (f) to produce<br>
fine hydrated titanium oxides, ie oxides having a particle<br>
size of less than 0.0003 mm (ie 0.3 micron) .<br>
Preferably the process includes using the liquid<br>
phase produced in hydrolysis step (f) as a source of acid<br>
or water in other steps of the process. Typically, the<br>
liquid phase includes 100-500 g/1 sulfuric acid. By way<br>
of example, the liquid phase may be used as a source of<br>
acid (and titanium.values) by direct addition to leach<br>
liquor, depleted leach liquor or any one of steps (a) to<br>
(c) and the further leach step. By way of further<br>
example, the liquid phase may be used as a source of water<br>
for washing solid products from any one of steps (b) and<br>
Alternatively, the process may include treating<br>
the liquid phase produced in hydrolysis step (f) by<br>
neutralising the acid in the liquid phase with lime (CaO)<br>
and/or limestone (CaCO3) and producing clean gypsum<br>
(CaS04.2H20) .<br>
It is known to produce gypsum by neutralising<br>
sulfuric acid in the liquid phase of the hydrolysis step<br>
in the conventional sulfate process. However, the gypsum<br>
product includes levels of impurities that reduce the<br>
- 10 -<br>
market value of the gypsum. The liquid phase produced in<br>
hydrolysis step (f) also includes sulfuric acid that can<br>
be neutralised to produce gypsum. However,<br>
advantageously, this liquid phase is relatively free of<br>
contaminants because the titanyl sulfate precipitation<br>
step does not recover substantial amounts (if any) of<br>
species (such as iron, chromium, manganese, and niobium)<br>
that are in solution in the leach liquor that could act as<br>
contaminants. Therefore, gypsum produced from this leach<br>
liquor is relatively pure.<br>
Preferably the process includes separating a<br>
bleed stream of the leach liquor to minimise the build-up<br>
of species (such as vanadium, chromium, and niobium) in<br>
solution in the leach liquor.<br>
The above-described process may be carried out as<br>
a continuous process or as a batch process.<br>
Preferably the titaniferous material is ilmenite<br>
or altered ilmenite.<br>
According to the present invention there is also<br>
provided hydrated titanium oxides that have been produced<br>
by leaching a titaniferous material (such as ilmenite)<br>
with sulfuric acid and forming a leach liquor that<br>
includes an acidic solution of titanyl sulfate and iron<br>
sulfate and thereafter hydrolysing titanyl sulfate and is<br>
characterised in that the hydrated titanium oxides include<br>
coarse particles of at least 0.005 mm (5 micron).<br>
The process of the present invention includes the<br>
following typical reactions.<br>
Leaching:<br>
Ferric reduction:<br>
Fe2{S04)3 + Fe° 3FeSO4<br>
Ferrous sulfate crystallisation:<br>
FeS047H20 FeSO.7H2O<br>
Solvent extraction loading:<br>
Ti(SO4)2 + H2O + R3P=O -^ R3PaO.TiOSO4 -f H2SO4<br>
Solvent extraction strip:<br>
R3P=O.TiOS04 -&gt; R3PssO + TiOSO4<br>
Hydrolysis:<br>
TiOS04 + 2H20 T10(OH)2 + H22SO4<br>
Calcination:<br>
T10OH)2  T102 + H20<br>
The improved sulfate process of the present<br>
invention is described further with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, of which:<br>
Figure 1 is a flow sheet that illustrates one<br>
embodiment of the process of the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a flow sheet that illustrates one<br>
embodiment of the process of the invention..<br>
With reference to the flow sheet of Figure 1, in<br>
a Stage 1 Leach step ilmenite, leach liquor containing<br>
between 400 and 700 g/1 sulfuric acid from a Stage 2 Leach<br>
step, and a reductant in the form of scrap iron are<br>
supplied to a digester 3. The process operates on a<br>
continuous basis with the feed materials being supplied<br>
continuously to the digester 3 and reacted and unreacted<br>
materials being discharged continuously from the digester<br>
The Stage 1 Leach step solubilises a substantial<br>
component of the ilmenite supplied to the digester 3 and<br>
produces a leach liquor that contains titanyl sulfate and<br>
iron sulfate. Typically, at the end of the leach the<br>
leach liquor contains 20-100 and preferably 40-50 g/1<br>
titanium and 50-100 g/1 iron.<br>
The leach liquor and partially and unreacted<br>
ilmenite that are discharged continuously from the<br>
digester 3 are subjected to a solid/liquid separation<br>
step.<br>
The solid phase from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step, which contains unreacted and partially reacted<br>
ilmenite, is transferred to the Stage 2 Leach step. The<br>
Stage 2 Leach step is discussed further below.<br>
The leach liquor from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step is transferred via a heat exchanger 5a to an iron<br>
sulfate crystallisation reactor 7.<br>
The heat exchanger 5a cools the leach liquor from<br>
a temperature of the order of 110°C to 60°C. The heat<br>
extracted by the heat exchanger 5a is used elsewhere in<br>
the process, as discussed further below.<br>
The leach liquor is cooled further, typically to<br>
10-30°C in the iron sulfate crystallisation reactor 7.<br>
Cooling the leach liquor precipitates iron sulfate from<br>
the leach liquor in the iron sulfate crystallisation<br>
reactor 7. Typically, the crystallisation step reduces<br>
the concentration of iron in the leach liquor to 40-50<br>
g/1.<br>
The leach liquor containing precipitated iron<br>
sulfate that is discharged from the crystallisation<br>
reactor 7 is subjected to a further solid/liquid<br>
separation step which separates the precipitated iron<br>
sulfate from the leach liquor.<br>
The solid phase from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step contains iron sulfate. The solid phase may also<br>
contain some species such as iron, manganese and<br>
aluminium. The solid phase is a by-product of the<br>
process.<br>
The leach liquor from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step is transferred via a heat exchanger 5b to a solvent<br>
extraction reactor 9 and contacts a suitable solvent that<br>
extracts titanyl sulfate from the leach liquor.<br>
Typically, the leach liquor from the solid/liquid<br>
separation step is at a temperature of the order of 30°C<br>
and the heat exchanger 5b heats the leach liquor to a<br>
higher temperature, typically 50°C. Conveniently, the heat<br>
input for heat exchanger 5b is heat recovered from the<br>
leach liquor by heat exchanger 5a.<br>
Suitable solvents are disclosed in Solex US<br>
patent 5277816. The solvents include trioctylphosphine<br>
oxide and butyl dibutylphosphonate. The present invention<br>
is not confined to these extractants.<br>
The solvent is used in conjunction with a<br>
modifier in the solvent extraction step. Suitable<br>
modifiers include methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), diisobutyl<br>
ketone (DISK) and isotridecanol (ITA).<br>
The solvent/titanyl sulfate mixture is separated<br>
from the leach liquor, and thereafter the titanyl sulfate<br>
is stripped from the solvent by water.<br>
The recovered solvent is returned to the solvent<br>
extraction reactor 9.<br>
The resultant aqueous solution of titanyl<br>
sulfate, which typically includes 10-100 g/1 titanium in<br>
solution and 50-200 g/1 sulfuric acid, is transferred to<br>
an hydrolysis reactor 11.<br>
If the objective of the process is to produce<br>
feed material for pigment production, the aqueous solution<br>
of titanyl sulfate may be processed in the hydrolysis<br>
reactor 11 by conventional hydrolysis options such as the<br>
Blumenfeld and Mecklenberg processes.<br>
If the objective of the process is to produce<br>
coarser feed material than that required for pigment<br>
production, the aqueous solution of titanyl sulfate is<br>
processed in the hydrolysis reactor 11 as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Specifically, at start-up, the reactor 11<br>
contains a starting solution of sulfuric acid and solids.<br>
Typically, the solution contains 10-200 g/1 acid and<br>
solids density of 10-200 g/1.<br>
The titanyl sulfate solution is added at a<br>
controlled rate to the starting solution. The addition of<br>
the solution results in the reactor filling up to capacity<br>
and thereafter overflowing, whereafter the rate of<br>
overflow from the reactor 11 matches the rate of supply of<br>
titanyl sulfate solution.<br>
In the reactor 11 the sulfate ions in the titanyl<br>
sulfate solution are displaced by hydroxyl ions, with the<br>
result that hydrated titanium oxides precipitate from the<br>
solution.<br>
The solids in the starting solution act as seed<br>
for precipitation. Typically, the solids are hydrated<br>
titanium oxide or titanium dioxide particles.<br>
Typically, the residence time of titanyl sulfate<br>
solution in the reactor 11 varies between 3 and 12 hours.<br>
Subject to temperature and time conditions and<br>
control of solution concentration, there is controlled<br>
crystal growth in the hydrolysis reactor 11. Controlled<br>
crystal growth provides an opportunity to produce titania<br>
that ranges from fine to coarse particle sizes. In<br>
particular, controlled crystal growth provides an<br>
opportunity to produce coarse titania of greater than<br>
0.005 mm (5 micron) which can be used by way of example in<br>
the electrochemical reduction of titania to produce<br>
titanium. One important parameter for controlling crystal<br>
growth is the concentration of titanium in solution within<br>
reactor 11. Specifically, it is preferred that the<br>
concentration be relatively low, of the order of 10 g/1,<br>
within reactor 11 to achieve growth rather than nucleation<br>
of titanium oxide particles.<br>
The hydrolysis reactor 11 may be operated in<br>
batch mode. More preferably, the reactor is operated in<br>
continuous mode.<br>
Moreover, if required, make-up water and solids<br>
can be added to the reactor 11.<br>
In either the conventional pigment production<br>
hydrolysis or the above coarse particle size hydrolysis,<br>
the overflow from the reactor 11 is collected as the<br>
product of the reactor 11.<br>
The product from the hydrolysis reactor 11 is<br>
subjected to a solid/liquid separation step, which is<br>
facilitated by providing wash water.<br>
The solid phase from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step, which contains hydrated titanium oxides, is<br>
transferred to a calciner (not shown) and is calcined to<br>
produce titania. Depending on the circumstances, the<br>
solid phase may be calcined at 1000°C to produce titania.<br>
In view of the efficiency of the solvent<br>
extraction step in confining extraction substantially to<br>
titanium compounds/ typically, the process produces<br>
partially reduced titania of very high purity/ ie at least<br>
99 wt.%.<br>
Part or all of the liquid phase from the<br>
solid/liquid separation step may be reused in the process,<br>
for example as a source of acid in the Stage 2 Leach step<br>
and/or as a source of water in washing steps in the<br>
process, as permitted by the overall water balance.<br>
Alternatively, the liquid phase from the<br>
solid/liquid separation step, which contains sulfuric<br>
acid, is neutralised with lime and/or limestone and<br>
thereby produces a gypsum product. In view of the<br>
efficiency of the solvent extraction step in confining<br>
extraction to titanium compounds, the liquid phase<br>
contains minimal levels of contaminants (such as iron,<br>
vanadium and chromium) and therefore the gypsum is "clean"<br>
gypsum that is commercially valuable in applications (such<br>
as the manufacture of cement).<br>
The raffinate from the solvent extraction step 9<br>
contains relatively high levels of sulfuric acid (250-700<br>
g/1) . The raffinate is transferred to the above-mentioned<br>
Stage 2 Leach step.and is used as a leach liquor. In<br>
effect, the solvent extraction step recovers sulfuric acid<br>
and the acid can be used productively in the process.<br>
This enables a substantial reduction in waste when<br>
compared with the conventional sulfate process. In<br>
addition, the use of the raffinate as part of the acid<br>
feed for the process reduces the amount of fresh acid that<br>
is required in the process.<br>
The Stage 2 Leach step is carried out in a<br>
digester 13.<br>
The raffinate, and make-up concentrated sulfuric<br>
acid that is also supplied to the digester 13, leach the<br>
unreacted and partially reacted ilmenite from the Stage 1<br>
Leach and solubilise approximately 50% of the remaining<br>
ilmenite. The raffinate may be preheated using a heat<br>
exchanger 5c before being supplied to the digester 13.<br>
The product from the Stage 2 Leach is subjected<br>
to a solid/liquid separation step.<br>
The leach liquor from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step, which typically contains 400-700 g/1 sulfuric acid,<br>
is transferred to the Stage 1 Leach, as mentioned above.<br>
The solid phase from the solid/liquid separation<br>
step is substantially made up of silicate residue, and is<br>
a waste product of the process.<br>
Make-up acid is required for the process since<br>
there are acid losses in the separation of iron sulfate<br>
from the leach liquor and in the extraction of titanyl<br>
sulfate in the solvent extraction step.<br>
The make-up acid may be added at any point in the<br>
flow sheet.<br>
The addition of the acid in the Stage 2 Leach<br>
step is a preferred addition point because it is thought<br>
that the introduction of concentrated acid at this point<br>
optimises the opportunity to leach ilmenite, and it is<br>
beneficial to maintaining an efficient heat balance.<br>
The flow sheet of Figure 2 is very similar to<br>
that shown in Figure 1 and the same reference numerals are<br>
used to describe the same features in both flow sheets.<br>
The main difference between the flow sheets is<br>
that, whilst the Figure 1 flow sheet describes that the<br>
raffinate from the solvent extraction step 9 is<br>
transferred to the Stage 2 Leach step and is used as a<br>
leach solution in that step, in the Figure 2 flow sheet<br>
the raffinate from the solvent extraction step 9 is split<br>
into 2 separate streams and is transferred via the<br>
separate streams to the Stage 1 Leach step and the Stage 2<br>
Leach step, respectively, and is used as a leach solution<br>
in both steps. In addition, whilst the Figure 1 flow<br>
sheet describes that the liquid phase of the product from<br>
the Stage 2 Leach step is transferred to the Stage 1 Leach<br>
step, in the Figure 2 flow sheet the liquid phase is<br>
transferred to the leach liquor produced in the Stage 1<br>
Leach step.<br>
The applicant has carried out experimental work<br>
on a laboratory scale and a pilot plant scale in relation<br>
to the above-described process.<br>
In summary, the applicant has made the following<br>
findings in the experimental scale work.<br>
• Fast leaching rates were achieved by<br>
leaching ilmenite in the presence of an<br>
accelerant, such as scrap iron, sodium<br>
thiosulfate, and sulfur dioxide.<br>
• Leach liquors containing up to 100 g/1<br>
titanium were produced.<br>
• The solvent extraction step resulted in a<br>
substantial upgrade in purity of titania that<br>
was ultimately produced from the titanyl sulfate<br>
extracted in the solvent extraction step.<br>
• The liquor stripped from the solvent in the<br>
solvent extraction step contained high levels<br>
(at least 30 g/1) titanyl sulfate.<br>
• Raffinate can be used to leach ilmenite in<br>
the initial and the further leach steps with or<br>
without make-up acid.<br>
• Two stage leaching is an effective leaching<br>
option, and the two (or more than two) stage<br>
leaching can be carried out in a single vessel<br>
with return of residual solid phase to the<br>
vessel and addition of fresh ilmenite or in<br>
multiple vessels with the residual solid phase<br>
produced in a 1st vessel being supplied to one or<br>
more than one other vessel.<br>
• There is a leach window (that is dependent<br>
on conditions such as acid concentration, leach<br>
temperature, and leach time and factors sch as<br>
titanium ion concentration) in which it is<br>
possible to avoid premature hydrolysis of<br>
hydrated titanium oxides and premature<br>
precipitation of titanyl sulfate.<br>
The laboratory scale and pilot plant scale work<br>
included leaching samples of heavy mineral sands<br>
concentrates containing &gt;50% ilmenite.<br>
The leaching work included leaching work on a<br>
batch basis in 2 stages at atmospheric pressure with 30-<br>
50% w/w sulfuric acid at 95-120°C for 3-5 hours in each<br>
stage, and with additions of accelerant/reductant in the<br>
form of iron, sodium thiosulfate and sulfur dioxide in<br>
each stage.<br>
The above leaching work was carried out with<br>
initial solids loadings of 500 g/1 and 200g/l.<br>
Table 1 is a summary of results of the above<br>
leaching work.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
indicates that 2 stage leaching, under<br>
the conditions described above, is an effective leaching<br>
option.<br>
The laboratory scale and the pilot plant scale<br>
work also included solvent extraction tests on leached<br>
ilmenite samples using a range of solvent extraction<br>
reagents and modifiers, including reagents of the type<br>
disclosed in the US patent 5277816 in the name of Solex<br>
Research Corporation of Japan.<br>
The solvent extraction tests were carried out<br>
after crystallisation of excess iron sulfate.<br>
The reagents included, by way of example, Cyanex<br>
923 [CCBHi7)3PO equivalent] and the aliphatic diluent<br>
Shellsol D100A. The modifiers included, by way of<br>
example, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), di-isobutyl ketone<br>
(D1BK) and isotridecanol (ITA).<br>
provides the composition of the feed<br>
solution and Table 3 provides titanium enrichment factors<br>
in the loaded organic.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
indicates that solvent extraction, under<br>
the conditions described above, is an effective means of<br>
separating titanium (in the form of titanyl sulfate) from<br>
contaminants.<br>
The above solvent extraction tests also indicated<br>
that solvent extraction is far more effective if a<br>
modifier is present. The modifier did not appear to have<br>
any effect on the degree of extraction of titanium.<br>
However, the modifier appeared to prevent the formation of<br>
an undesirable titanium-loaded phase that is not soluble<br>
in the diluent. Thus, without the modifier, only<br>
relatively dilute solutions of titanium are possible.<br>
The following Examples illustrate further the<br>
laboratory scale and pilot plant scale work carried out by<br>
the applicant.<br>

A single stage leach pilot plant was assembled,<br>
consisting of 5 stirred FRP tanks of 10 L capacity each,<br>
equipped with FRP double axial turbines, and silica<br>
jacketed electric immersion heaters. Ilmenite ground to<br>
50% passing 32(aa. was fed to the first tank at 750 g/hour<br>
using a screw feeder. SX pilot plant raffinate of<br>
composition 404 g/1 free H2S04, 36.1 g/1 Fe2*, 3.2 g/1 Fe3+<br>
and 10 g/1 Ti, was also pumped into the first tank at a<br>

Example 11 - Batch Hydrolysis<br>
1000 mL of SZ pilot plant loaded strip liquor<br>
containing 123 g/1 free H2S04, 0 g/1 Fe2*, 0.26 g/1 Fe3* and<br>
12 g/1 Ti was pretreated with 1 g of aluminium foil<br>
overnight at room temperature. Titration with dichromate<br>
with sodium diphenylamine sulfonate as indicator showed<br>
the resulting solution to contain 2.4 g/1 Ti3*. 500 mL of<br>
water containing 100 g/1 free H2S04, and 0.5 g of TiO(OH)2<br>
seed, was preheated to 95°C, in a glass reactor equipped<br>
with baffles and a Teflon agitator. The treated loaded<br>
strip liquor was then pumped into the reactor at 2.8<br>
mL/min over 6 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to<br>
stir for a further 30 minutes then a sample was withdrawn<br>
and filtered. Analysis of the solution showed it to<br>
contain 147 g/1 free H2S04, 0.24 g/1 Fe and 2.3 g/1 Ti.<br>
The slurry was filtered, and the solids washed with water<br>

maintained at 95°C in each tank. Water was added to the<br>
first tank to control the acidity to 140 g/1, requiring a<br>
flow of 8.5 mL/min. Additional water was added to the<br>
second tank at 5 mL/min to control the acidity to 100 g/1.<br>
Slurry was thence allowed to flow by gravity to a FRP<br>
thickener equipped with FRP rakes. Thickener overflow<br>
solution was collected and stored. The thickener underflow<br>
slurry was collected and filtered by vacuum filtration.<br>
Filtration of the underflow was found to be very fast. The<br>

Many modifications may be made to the process of<br>
the present invention described above without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
By way of example, whilst the above-described<br>
flow sheet describes that the Stage 1 and Stage 2 Leach<br>
steps are carried out in single digesters 3 and 13,<br>
respectively, the present invention is not so limited and<br>
extends to arrangements that include multiple digesters<br>
for each stage.<br>
In addition, whilst the above-described flow<br>
sheet describes that the Stage 1 and Stage 2 Leach steps<br>
are carried out in separate digesters 3 and 13,<br>
respectively, the present invention is not so limited and<br>
extends to arrangements in which leaching of titaniferous<br>
material is carried out in a single digester, with return<br>
of residual solid phase to the digester and direct supply<br>
of raffinate from the solvent extraction step 9 to the<br>
digester.<br><br><br><br><br>

1.	A sulfate process for producing titania from a titaniferous material which includes the<br>
steps of:<br>
(a)	leaching the titaniferous material with a leach solution containing sulfuric acid and forming a leach liquor that includes an acidic solution of titanyl sulfate (T1OSO4) and iron sulfate (FeS04);<br>
(b)	separating the leach liquor and a residual solid phase from the leach step (a);<br>
(c)	precipitating iron sulfate from the leach liquor from step (b) and separating precipitated iron sulfate from the leach liquor;<br>
(d)	extracting titanyl sulfate from the leach liquor from step (c) with a suitable solvent of the kind such as herein before described and thereafter stripping titanyl sulfate from the solvent and forming a raffinate having an acid concentration of at least 250 g/L sulphuric acid and a solution that contains titanyl sulfate;<br>
(e)	using at least part of the raffinate from solvent extraction step (d) as at least part of the leach solution in the leach step (a);<br>
(f)	hydrolysing the solution that contains titanyl sulfate and forming hydrated titanium oxides from the titanyl sulfate;<br>
(g)	separating a solid phase containing hydrated titanium oxides and a liquid phase that are produced in the hydrolysis step (f); and<br>
(h)       calcining the solid phase from step (g) and forming titania.<br><br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 further comprising a further leach step of leaching the residual solid phase from step (b) with a leach solution containing sulfuric acid and forming a leach liquor that includes an acidic solution of titanyl sulfate and iron sulfate and a residual solid phase.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 2 comprising carrying out the leach step (a) and the further leach step in the same vessel.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 3 wherein the further leach step includes returning the residual solid phase from step (b) to the vessel.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 4 further comprising carrying out the leach step (a) and the further leach step in separate vessels and supplying the residual solid phase from the leach step (a) to the separate vessel or vessels.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in claim 5 wherein the further leach step includes separating the leach liquor and a further residual solid phase formed in the further leach step.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 6 further comprising supplying the separated leach liquor to the leach step (a) or mixing the separated leach liquor with the leach liquor from step (b).<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 2 wherein step (e) includes using at least part of the raffinate from solvent extraction step (d) as at least part of the leach solution in the further leach step.<br>
9.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step includes selecting and/or controlling one or more leach conditions in the leach step or steps to avoid undesirable amounts of premature hydrolysis of hydrated titanium oxides and undesirable amounts of premature precipitation of titanyl sulfate.<br><br>
10.	The process as claimed in claim 9 wherein the leach conditions include any one or more than one of acid concentration, leach temperature and leach time.<br>
11.	The process as claimed in claim 9 further comprising selecting and/or controlling the acid concentration to be at least 350 g/L sulfuric acid throughout the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step when operating at a leach temperature in the range of 95 °C to the boiling point in order to avoid premature hydrolysis.<br>
12.	The process as claimed in claim 9 further comprising selecting and/or controlling the acid concentration to be less than 450 g/L at the end of the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step when operating at a leach temperature in the range of 95 °C to the boiling point in order to avoid an undesirable amount of premature precipitation of titanyl sulfate.<br>
13.	The process as claimed in claim 9 further comprising selecting and/or controlling the leach conditions so that the titanium ion concentration in the leach liquor is less than 50 g/L in the leach liquor at the end of the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step.<br>
14.	The process as claimed in claim 1 further comprising carrying out the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step in the presence of a leaching accelerant that accelerates the rate of leaching the titaniferous material.<br>
15.	The process as claimed in claim 13 wherein the leaching accelerant is selected from the group consisting of iron, a titanium (III) salt, a thiosulfate salt, sulfur dioxide, a reduced sulfur containing species, and mixtures thereof.<br>
16.	The process as claimed in claim 1 further comprising carrying out the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step in the presence of a reductant that reduces ferric ions to ferrous ions in the acidic solution or solutions of titanyl sulfate and iron sulfate produced in the leach step (a) and/or the further leach step.<br><br>
17.	The process as claimed in claim 16 wherein the reductant is selected from the group consisting of iron, a titanium (III) salt, a thiosulfate salt, sulfur dioxide, a reduced sulfur containing species, and mixtures thereof.<br>
18.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the solvent extraction step (d) includes contacting the leach liquor with the selected solvent and a modifier.<br>
19.	The process as claimed in claim 1 further comprising controlling the hydrolysis step (f) to produce a selected particle size distribution of the hydrated titanium oxides product.<br></td>
