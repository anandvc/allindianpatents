				<td>A pharmaceutical composition comprising 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one<br>
with improved storage and solubility properties<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to an improved formulation of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002] 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one is a steroid in the pregnane<br>
family and a modulator of GABA,-receptor activity which is indicated for the treatment<br>
of sex/stress steroid induced disorders conditions (W099/4593 1 ). 3-beta-hydroxy-5-<br>
alpha-pregnan-20-one is poorly soluble in many therapeutically acceptable solvents,<br>
which makes it difficult to administer the compound to a patient.<br>
[0003] In animal studies, 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one has been<br>
intravenously administered to rats in a formulation containing cyclodextrin<br>
(W099/4593 1 ).<br>
[0004] Grant et al (JPET 326:354-362, 2008) has administered 3-beta-hydroxy-5-<br>
alpha-pregnan-20-one to monkeys by using a formulation with hydroxypropyl Pcyclodextrin.<br>
[0005] Formulations with cyclodextrins are not suitable for administration to<br>
human patients. One reason for this is, because 3-beta-hydroxy-5-aIpha-pregnan-20-<br>
one is poorly soluble, the formulation results in a large therapeutic volume that can<br>
only be administered intravenously.<br>
[0006] Since 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one is poorly soluble in water<br>
there is still no pharmaceutically acceptable formulation for this compound.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0007] As used in the present application, the following terms have the specified<br>
meanings unless otherwise specified.<br>
[0008] By "acylglycerol" is meant all types and combinations of fatty acids<br>
esterified to glycerol.<br>
[0009] By "medium-chain acylglycerol" is meant a mixture of acylglycerols where<br>
the total com bined percentage of octanoic (caprylic) acid and decanoic (capric) acid<br>
is at least 95%.<br>
[00010] By "solid fat content" is meant the percentage of solid as determined by<br>
pulse NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance).<br>
[0001 11 "Room temperature" denotes a temperature of between 1 8°C and 25°C.<br>
[000 1 21 "UC 1 0 1 0"denotes 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.<br>
[000 1 31 "Sterol or ester thereof" denotes steroids with at least one hydroxyl group<br>
and esters of said steroids where at least one hydroxyl group has been used for the<br>
synthesis of an ester.<br>
[00014] Steroids, such as sterols, are usually described by the number of carbon<br>
atoms in the compound. Thus, for example, cholesterol is a C27 sterol, which indicates<br>
that the compound consists of 27 carbon atoms.<br>
[000 1 51 Unless stated otherwise, concentrations are stated as mg/g, that is, mg<br>
per gram of pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Brief description of fig- ures<br>

20-one (ng/mL) in rabbits following subcutaneous administration of 3-betahydroxy-<br>
5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in sesame oil with cholesterol (1 : 1 ) in two doses: 1<br>
mg/kg (squares) and 5 mg/kg (circles).<br>

Summary of invention<br>
[00019] An object of the present invention is to provide an improved formulation of<br>
3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[00020] Another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onew ith enhanced storage properties.<br>
[00021] Yet another object is to provide a formulation of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one with improved pharmacokinetics.<br>
[00022] Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onew ith increased solubility in a pharmacologically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
[00023] These and other objects are met by a first general aspect of the present<br>
invention which provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 3-beta-hydroxy-5-<br>
alpha-pregnan-20-one, at least one sterol or an ester thereof and a mixture of<br>
acylglycerols with a solid fat content of less than about 25% at 25°C and about 0% at<br>
37°C.<br>
[00024] In a second general aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
[00025] In a third general aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
pharmaceutical composition obtainable according to a method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
[00026] In a fourth general aspect of the present invention there is provided use of<br>
a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of conditions of the central nervous<br>
system.<br>
Detailed description<br>
[00027l The inventors have found that the addition of a sterol surprisingly<br>
increases the solubility and improves the pharmacokinetics of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one in acylglycerols.<br>
[0002 81 Generally, the pharmaceutical composition comprises 3-beta-hydroxy-5-<br>
alpha-pregnan-20-one, at least one sterol or an ester thereof and a mixture of<br>
acylglycerols with a solid fat content of less than about 25% at 25°C and about 0% at<br>
[00029] In particular a sterol with a hydroxyl group bound to the third carbon<br>
atom of the sterol structure is useful in the invention. The sterol may be cholesterol or<br>
beta-sitosterol, but also other sterols such as stigmasterol, brassicasterol or avenasterol<br>
may be used. In particular, cholesterol may be used.<br>
[00030] In addition, cholesteryl esters can be used. Examples of such esters are<br>
sodium cholesteryl sulphate, cholesteryl bensoate, cholesteryl acetate, cholesteryl<br>
caprylate, cholesteryl decanoate, cholestyl palmitate, cholesteryl oleate and cholesteryl<br>
steara te.<br>
[00031] The sterol or ester thereof can be a C18-C30 sterol or an ester thereof, a<br>
C21 -C27 sterol or an ester thereof, or a C27-C29 sterol or ester thereof.<br>
[00032] The pharmaceutical composition can, in a first embodiment, be such that<br>
3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one is essentially dissolved in the composition. Thus<br>
3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onec an be dissolved or essentially dissolved<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention.<br>
[00033] The weight ratio of sterol (or ester thereof) to 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one can, in this embodiment, be in the range of about 1 : 10 to 10: 1 . The<br>
sterol or ester thereof may be added in an amount that is similar to the amount of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one by weight. Because 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one and a sterol have similar molecular weights this results in almost<br>
equimolar amounts of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-oneto sterol.<br>
[00034] Thus, the weight ratio of sterol to 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one<br>
can be in the range of from 1 :5 to 5: 1 . In particular, the weight ratio of sterol to 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha pregnan-20-one can be from 1 :3 to 3: 1 .<br>
[00035] Suitable concentrations of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha pregnan-20-one are<br>
between 0.1 mg/g and 75 mg/g. The concentration of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha<br>
pregnan-20-one can also be between 1 mg/g and 50 mg/g, between 5 mg/g and<br>
30 mg/g or between 10 mg/g and 25 mg/g.<br>
[00036] Alternatively, in a second embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprises a suspension of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one. In this case the<br>
pharmaceutical composition will comprise 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in<br>
particles as well as 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-oned issolved in the<br>
composition. The sterol increases the soluble fraction of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one in such a suspension compared to a suspension without a sterol. One<br>
advantage with a suspension is that the formulation can contain a high concentration<br>
of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.A n additional advantage with a<br>
composition that comprises a suspension is that it results in slow release of 3-betahydroxy-<br>
5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.<br>
[00037] When the pharmaceutical composition comprises a suspension, the<br>
particles are preferably of a range of sizes that is not engulfed by macrophages.<br>
Macrophages do primarily engulf particles of a size that is 2-3 micrometer (Champion<br>
et al, Pharm Res 2008; 25(8): 1 8 15-1 82 1 ).<br>
[00038] In this second embodiment, the weight ratio of sterol (or ester thereof) to 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha pregnan-20-one can be in the range of about 1 : 1 0 to 1 0: 1 . The<br>
weight ratio of sterol to 3-beta-hydroxy-5aIpha pregnan-20-one can be in the range of<br>
from 1 :5 to 5: 1 . In particular, the weight ratio of sterol to 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one can be from 1 :4 to 3:1 or from 1 :3 to 3:1.<br>
[00039] Suitable concentrations of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onea re, in<br>
this second embodiment, between 0.1 mg/g and 750 mg/g. The concentration of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one can also be between 1 mg/g and 300 mg/g,<br>
between 1 mg/g and 100 mg/g, between 1 mg/g and 50 mg/g, between 5 mg/g<br>
and 30 mg/g or between 10 mg/g and 25 mg/g.<br>
[00040] The following applies to the invention in general.<br>
[0004 11 Generally, the mixture of acylglycerols is characterized in that it has a<br>
solid fat content of less than about 25% at 25°C and about 0% at 37°C. Thus, the<br>
solid fat content is, for practical purposes, 0% at 37°C. The solid fat content is at most<br>
0.01 % at 37°C.<br>
[00042] The mixture of acylglycerols can be a vegetable oil. Thus, it can be a<br>
vegetable oil selected from the group consisting of sesame oil, peanut oil, olive oil,<br>
and castor oil, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[00043] In particular the mixture of acylglycerols can be a medium-chain<br>
acylglycerol, that is, a mixture of acylglycerols wherein the total combined percentage<br>
of fatty acids with 8 carbon atoms (octanoic acid) and 10 carbon atoms (decanoic<br>
acid) is at least 95%. The medium-chain acylglycerol can be various mixtures of<br>
monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols.<br>
[00044] The medium-chain acylglycerol can consist of from about 50% to about<br>
65% of monoacylglycerols, about 25% to about 35% of diacylglycerols, less than<br>
about 5% of triacylglycerols and less than about 2.5% of glycerol. An example of such<br>
a medium chain acylglycerol is Akoline MCM.<br>
[00045] The medium-chain acylglycerol can be such that it comprises at least about<br>
95% triacylglycerols. Akomed R MCT is an example of such a medium-chain<br>
acylglycerol.<br>
[00046] The mixture of acylglycerols can comprise a mixture of a vegetable oil and<br>
a medium-chain acylglycerol. The mixture of acylglycerols can comprises a mixture of<br>
castor oil and a medium-chain acylglycerol where castor oil is present in an amount of<br>
between 40% and 60% by weight. The mixture of acylglycerols can consist of about<br>
48% by weight of castor oil and about 52% by weight of a medium-chain<br>
acylglycerol. In particular the mixture of acylglycerols can consist of about 48% by<br>
weight castor oil and about 52% by weight of a medium-chain acylglycerol.<br>
[00047] The pharmaceutical composition may comprise additional excipients<br>
known to a person skilled in the art such as antioxidants, preservatives, surfactants,<br>
coloring, flavoring, or thickening agents.<br>
[00048] The pharmaceutical composition can be administered to the patient by<br>
different means. Thus, it may be administered orally, parenterally or topically. Thus, the<br>
pharmacological composition may be administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intravenously, nasally, transdermally or vaginally.<br>
[00049] In a second general aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one.<br>
[00050] One method, in which 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one is dissolved<br>
or essentially dissolved in the composition, comprises the steps of a) dissolving 3-betahydroxy-<br>
5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in ethanol, b) adding a mixture of acylglycerols with<br>
a solid fat content of less than about 25% at 25°C and about 0% at 37°C and a sterol<br>
or ester thereof, c) mixing until a homogeneous liquid is obtained and d) evaporating<br>
the ethanol.<br>
[00051] When the mixture of acylglycerol is a solid or a semi-solid at room<br>
temperature, such as a medium-chain acylglycerol, the method may comprise a further<br>
step, which is the melting of the medium-chain acylglycerol before mixing it with the<br>
ethanol-drug preparation. The melting step enables the homogeneous mixing of this<br>
type of acylglycerol with other components. Once melted and mixed with the other<br>
components, the preparation remains in a liquid state for at least the time periods<br>
indicated in Table 1.<br>
[00052] When the formulation comprises a suspension, the formulation is<br>
advantageously prepared according to a method that comprises the following steps: 1 )<br>
dissolving or suspending the sterol or ester thereof in the mixture of acylglycerols, 2)<br>
suspending 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in the acylglycerol-sterol mixture,<br>
3) gently mixing. Surprisingly, this procedure leads to suspended particles comprising<br>
3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-oneo f smaller size.<br>
[00053] In a third general aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
pharmaceutical compositions obtainable by the methods according to the second<br>
aspect of the invention.<br>
[00054] In a fourth general aspect of the present invention there is provided the<br>
use of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention for the treatment or<br>
prevention of conditions of the central nervous system.<br>
[00055] The pharmaceutical composition can be used to treat or prevent conditions<br>
of the central nervous system. Examples of such conditions that can be treated are<br>
epilepsy, menstruation cycle dependant epilepsy, depression, stress related<br>
depression, migraine, tiredness and in particular stress related tiredness, premenstrual<br>
syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, menstrual cycle linked mood changes,<br>
stress related memory changes, menstrual cycle linked memory changes, Alzheimer's<br>
dementia, menstrual cycle linked difficulties in concentration, menstrual cycle linked<br>
sleep disorders and tiredness, substance abuse, menstrual cycle linked alcoholism, or<br>
com binations thereof.<br>
[00056] In particular the pharmaceutical composition can be used to treat steroid<br>
induced mood disorders, in particular premenstrual dysphoric disorder.<br>
[00057] The pharmaceutical composition can also be used for treating or<br>
preventing side effects of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal therapy.<br>
[00058] The pharmaceutical composition can also be used for control or<br>
termination of steroid-induced anesthesia.<br>
Examples<br>
[00059] The invention will now be described with non-limiting examples.<br>
[00060] In order to find a pharmaceutical composition comprising 3-beta-hydroxy-<br>
5-alpha-pregnan-20-one, several different vehicles and com binations of vehicles were<br>
evaluated. 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onew as dissolved in various vehicles<br>
and was evaluated by eye for physical stability at room temperature over time. A<br>
formulation that did not undergo any visible changes in appearance and remained<br>
clear on storage in room temperature without signs of haziness, precipitation,<br>
sedimentation, phase separation into two or more liquid phases or change of colour,<br>
within 30 days was considered as "stable".<br>
[00061] In addition, the particle size and solubility of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one in formulations comprising a suspension of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alphapregnan-<br>
20-one were evaluated.<br>
General procedure for examples 1-49<br>
[00062] The following procedure was adopted for the preparation of 3-betahydroxy-<br>
5-alpha-pregnan-20-one-containing formulations.<br>
[00063] The desired amount of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onea nd sterol<br>
(for example cholesterol) was weighed in a 100 ml or 250 ml round-bottomed flask.<br>
To every gram of the mixture of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one and sterol a<br>
volume of about 30 ml of absolute ethanol was added. The mixture was treated in an<br>
ultrasonication bath (not exceeding 50°C) until a clear liquid was obtained. This was<br>
normally accomplished within 10 minutes. The additional lipid ingredients indicated in<br>
the "Vehicle" column in Table 1 was then added up to 20 g. The resulting mixture was<br>
gently shaken by hand until a clear, homogeneous liquid was obtained. When the<br>
lipid was a solid at room temperature it was melted in the warm ultrasonication bath to<br>
a liquid form before addition.<br>
[00064] Compounds from the following suppliers were used (product numbers<br>
within brackets): Cholesterol from Sigma (C8503), olive oil and peanut oil from<br>
Apoteket, Sweden (26 36 16 and 26 66 01, respectively), sesame oil from Fluka<br>
(85067), and castor oil from Sigma (259853). Akomed R medium-chain triacylglycerol<br>
(MCT) and Akoline medium-chain monoacylglycerol (MCM) were both from<br>
AarhusKarlshamns Sweden AB, Karlshamn, Sweden.<br>
[00065] The alcohol was evaporated from the liquid on a rotary evaporator at a<br>
pressure of about 25 mbar and a temperature of about 40°C until the weight of the<br>
flask was essentially constant. The remaining ethanol content was essentially less than<br>
1 %. The aim was to obtain a liquid with the appearance of clear oil at room<br>
temperature. The oily liquid was then transferred to clear glass vials and stored at<br>
room temperature until evaluation.<br>
[00066] The samples were evaluated by observing the samples in the glass vials<br>
and recording signs of haziness, precipitation, sedimentation, phase separation into<br>
two or more liquid phases, or change of colour after 1 or 2 days after preparation and<br>
after 30 days after preparation. In some cases, other time intervals were used<br>
(indicated in Table 1). Where indicated, the entire sample was placed in a refrigerator<br>
(2-8°C) to provoke precipitation.<br>
Example 1<br>
[00067] 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one (UC 1 0 1 0) (5 mg/g) and peanut<br>
oil was mixed into an emulsion with ethanol as described above in the concentrations<br>
shown in Table 1, and the ethanol was evaporated. The final weight of the<br>
preparation was 20 g. The mixture then had the form of an oily liquid. After one day<br>
when the sample was evaluated there were signs of precipitation. At 30 days the<br>
precipitate has formed a bottom sediment. Thus, the formulation was not stable.<br>
Example 2<br>
[00068] Example 2 was carried out essentially as Example 1 with the difference<br>
that cholesterol (5.5 mg/g) was added. When the sample was evaluated after one<br>
day the appearance of the sample had not changed. It was still unchanged after 30<br>
days and after four months. After five months there was a slight precipitation. Example<br>
2 compared with Example 1 shows how the addition of 5.5 mg/g cholesterol to a<br>
solution of 5 mg/g 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in peanut oil substantially<br>
increases the solubility so that, instead of precipitating, no precipitation occurred and<br>
the sample was stable for four months. However, a slight sedimentation occurred after<br>
5 months.<br>
Examples 3 to 49<br>
[00069] Examples 3 to 49 were carried out essentially as described above with<br>
the variations with regard to 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onec oncentration,<br>
acylglycerol mixture used, sterol used and sterol concentration that are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
[00070] The data from examples 1 to 49 is presented in Table 1 . The effect of<br>
addition of cholesterol is, for example, evident in examples 8 and 12, where the<br>
addition of cholesterol (1 0 mg/g) substantially increased solubility so that the sample<br>
did not precipitate but instead was stable for 12 months.<br>
[00071] In Table 1, "Weighed amount of UC1010 (mg/g)" is the amount of 3-<br>
beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one per gram of final total composition including<br>
sterol (when a sterol is present). "Vehicle" denotes the carrier being tested. The amount<br>
of sterol is stated as "mg/gU, that is, the weight of sterol per weight of final total<br>
composition, including 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one. "Appearance at<br>
preparation" describes the change of appearance of the mixture during preparation;<br>
usually the preparation is initially an emulsion or a solution whereas it has an oily<br>
appearance after evaporation of the ethanol; "Unchanged" denotes a sample that was<br>
stable and where thus 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one remained in solution,<br>
without visible signs of haziness, precipitation, sedimentation, phase separation into<br>
two or more liquid phases or change of colour. This is also indicated by an asterisk (*)<br>
in the table.<br>

Examples 50-75<br>
[00072] Examples 50 to 75 were carried out essentially as examples 1 -49.<br>
Akoline Medium-Chain Monoglyceride (MCM) (Batch 8 192270 and 82 1 8940) and<br>
Akomed R Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) (Batch 4765) were obtained from<br>
AarhusKarlshamns Sweden AB, Karlshamn, Sweden. Absolute ethanol (&gt;99%) was<br>
obtained from VWR International.<br>
[00073] The procedure for making and evaluating lipid-based formulations was as<br>
follows: The batch sizes were either 20 g or 100 g of final formulation. The desired<br>
amounts of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onea nd cholesterol were weighed in a<br>
round-bottomed flask, 250 or 1000 ml depending on the batch size.<br>
[00074] To every gram of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onea nd cholesterol<br>
mixture a volume of about 15 to 30 ml of absolute ethanol was added. The smaller<br>
volume of alcohol per gram of solute was used when preparing the largest batch size<br>
of 1 00 g of final formulation. The mixture was treated in an ultrasonication bath (not<br>
exceeding 55°C) until a clear solution was obtained. This was normally accomplished<br>
within a few minutes. The glycerides were then added and the resulting mixture was<br>
treated in the ultrasonication bath for a few seconds until a clear, homogeneous liquid<br>
was obtained. The alcohol was evaporated from the liquid on a rotary evaporator at a<br>
pressure of about 20 mbar and a temperature of about 40°C until weight of the flask<br>
was more or less constant. Normally, the remaining ethanol content was 0.5% (w/w)<br>
or less. The evaporation time was 0.5-1.5 h, depending on the batch size. The aim<br>
was to obtain a practically uncolored liquid with the appearance of a clear oil at room<br>
temperature. The liquid was transferred to clear glass vials, which were stored at room<br>
temperature until evaluation. Some selected formulations were portioned and stored at<br>
2-8°C for limited period of time.<br>
[00075] The evaluation comprised observation of the physical stability at room<br>
temperature over time. The samples were observed for haziness, precipitation of<br>
particles, aggregates or crystals, and subsequent sedimentation and/or phase<br>
separation into two or more liquid phases, and/or change of colour.<br>
[00076] It was possible to dissolve up to 25 mg of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-<br>
20-one per gram of final formulation based on 50% MCT and 50% MCM (examples<br>
68 and 69) without any noticeable change in appearance when stored at room<br>
temperature for more than 1 month. One of the samples (example 69) also withstood<br>
storage at 2-8°C and repeated temperature cycling.<br>
[00077] In order to check the robustness and reproducibility of the formulations<br>
and the procedure for the preparation thereof, a scaling up of the batch size from 20<br>
g to 100 g of final formulation was performed. The compositions corresponding to<br>
examples 60 and 69 were selected for this procedure. From the behavior during<br>
preparation and the initial observations of the resulting formulations (examples 74 and<br>
75) it can be concluded that the adopted procedure is both robust and reproducible<br>
for making up to 100 g of formulation.<br>

[00078] The objective of the study was to investigate the comparative<br>
pharmacokinetics in plasma of a 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onef ormulation<br>
comprising sesame oil and cholesterol following subcutaneous administration to New<br>
Zealand White rabbits. Two groups of three female rabbits each received single doses<br>
1 mg/kg (formulation as in example 7) or 5 mg/kg (formulation as in example 10).<br>
Following subcutaneous injection into the dorsal neck region of the animals, blood<br>
samples were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1 2 and 24 hours post dose.<br>
Concentrations of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in plasma were measured<br>
by a validated LC-MS/MS method. Data are presented in Figure 1 , and show mean<br>
plasma concentration (ng/mL) of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onefo r the two<br>
doses: 1 mg/kg (squares) and 5 mg/kg (circles).<br>

Example 77<br>
[00079] Suspensions of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onew ere prepared for<br>
investigation of solubility as follows: cholesterol was first dissolved at room temperature<br>
in sesame oil at 10 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. Suspensions of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-<br>
alpha-pregnan-20-one in sesame oil with different amounts of cholesterol were<br>
prepared on a magnetic stirrer at about 500 rpm using a conventional Teflon coated<br>
stir bar, at room temperature for several days, with occasional cycling to 2-8°C. At this<br>
time, the particles have become substantially smaller. Thereafter, samples of the<br>
respective suspensions were filtered through a 0.2 pm filter and analyzed with regard<br>
to concentration of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.T he results are presented<br>
in Table 3 and Figure 2 where it can be seen that increasing the amounts of<br>
cholesterol increases the soluble fraction of 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one.<br>
Figure 2 shows data for a 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onec oncentration of 1 0<br>
mg/g. Figure 3a and 3 b show microscopy pictures taken at 5x enlargement of<br>
suspensions with a 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-onec oncentration of 1 0 mg/g<br>
and a cholesterol:3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one ratio of 1 : 1 immediately<br>
upon mixing (3a) and after several days of stirring (3b).<br>
Table 3<br>
Example 78<br>
[00080] Micronized 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one (1 0 mg/g) with a<br>
mean particle size of 6 micrometer was suspended in sesame oil with cholesterol (20<br>
mg/g) and stirred as in example 77. Photos were taken immediately upon suspension<br>
(Fig 4a) and after 19 hours of stirring (Fig 4b).<br>
Conclusion<br>
[0008 11 It has been shown that the presence of a sterol such as cholesterol<br>
improves the possibilities to formulate 3-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising acylglycerols, either as an oily solution or an<br>
oily suspension.<br>
