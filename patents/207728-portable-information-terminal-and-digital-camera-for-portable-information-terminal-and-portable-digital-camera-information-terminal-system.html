PORTABLE INFORMATION TERMINAL AND<br>
DIGITAL CAMERA FOR PORTABLE INFORMATION TERMINAL<br>
AND PORTABLE DIGITAL CAMERA/INFORMATION TERMINAL SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a portable information terminal such as portable phones having earphone jack for sound input/output, PHS (personal handy-phone system), PDA (personal digital assistants), mobile personal computers, a digital camera for use with the portable information terminal, a portable digital camera/information terminal system comprised by a information terminal and a digital camera, and a method of controlling the portable information terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, in the milieu of increasing speed of data communication using portable information terminals and significant progress that has been achieved in information communication technologies, portable telephones have transformed themselves from a usage as telephone to an integrated information tool that is being accepted rapidly.<br>
With such a trend, customer needs have expanded from basic information such as images, music, mail to higher levels of content such as moving images and programs, and it is anticipated that even more applications will be created in the future.<br>
In response to such needs of consumers, machines that might be termed information vending machines have begun to appear in the marketplace to provide a service of selling not only sound data information but information of various other kinds that can be accessed by connecting a portable information terminal to the information vending machine with a special cable.<br>
When receiving information from an information vending machine using such a special cable, it is necessary to insert a connector of the cable to the portable terminal, but one problem of inconvenience has been that, because the connector has a front side and a back side to ensure that the connection is made in a fixed direction, resulting in a problem of inconvenience that the user must confirm front and back surfaces of the connector.<br>
Also, when the connector is inserted into the portable terminal, locking mechanism of the connector operates and the connection becomes locked, but if the user<br><br>
2<br>
tries to pull the connector out without realizing that it is locked, the connector can be subjected to excessive load and damage may result. Also, when the portable telephone and PHS are used as a communication device for mobile computing, PC card is normally used as an interface, and therefore, it is necessary to carry PC card and connection cables when one is travelling, which present another inconvenience. Also, some computers have only one PCMIA (personal computer memory card international association) slot for inserting a PC (personal computer) card so that, when this slot is taken up by the portable telephone, other devices cannot be connected, which has been an annoyance. Further, if it is desired to use some peripheral device, the PC card inserted into the PCMIA slot must be exchanged to another card, resulting in a problem of time-consuming handling.<br>
In the meantime, in response to a need for transmitting images recorded in a digital camera to another terminal by connecting the digital camera to the portable terminal, Japanese Patent Applications, First Publications, Hei 10-341302 and Hei 11-08823 disclose a technique of chord-based connections such as IRDA (infrared data access) or RS-232C to connect the digital camera to the portable terminal for transmitting the data.<br>
However, for transferring image data using chords such as IRDA or RS232C, problems are handling and portability.<br>
Also, conventional digital cameras are expected to be connectable to various general portable communication terminals such as portable telephone terminal, PHS, PDA, mobile personal computers, so that, even though a display section such as liquid crystal monitor and an operation section are provided for the portable terminal, they are often provided for the digital camera also, and handling becomes complex and the cost of the combined system increases. Also, because it is not possible to supply power from a device to which the camera is connected, the camera itself must have a power source, and the size of the casing increases, thus present a problem that it is unsuitable as a portable device. As explained above, it has been difficult, in the past, to avoid the complexity of camera structure and realize a highly convenient digital camera.<br>
Also, image data are generally transferred serially according to EIA (Electronic Industry Association) standard, but IRDA and RS-232 and others always require special interfaces. Also, in addition to data transfer methods using cables as described above, a Japanese Patent Application, First Publication, Hei 06-268582 discloses a technique of data transfer through a medium such as a memory card, but even when using such a<br><br>
3<br>
technique, interface circuit and driver circuit are necessary. For this reason, when connecting a digital camera to a portable communication terminal, expensive parts and interfaces are required in the past, present a problem that it has been difficult to reduce the size of the digital cameras and portable terminals or to reduce the combined system cost.<br>
Furthermore, when using RS-232C cable such as the one described above, serial communication according to EIA RS-232C standard is used, but in normal serial communication, it is necessary to perform an operation, the so-called "handshake operation", by exchanging certain commands between the portable terminal and the digital camera, before commencing communication so that image data are transferred after confirming that both sides are in operational states, resulting a problem that image data transfer operation cannot be started promptly. Also, in serial communication, information to discriminate start and finish of individual data is attached to each byte (=8 bits) of data, so that, when 2-bits of the 8-bits are used for discrimination purpose, the amount of information that can be carried by 1 byte is only 6 bits, leading to a problem that the data themselves are not being processed efficiently. In addition to this problem, although parallel communication that increases the transfer speed by increasing the number of serial lines is known, the parallel data transfer technique is not preferable because it increases the system cost due to the fact that the number of signal lines must be increased in the connection terminal of the devices such as digital camera and portable communication terminal that demand small size, light weight and low cost.<br>
Also, when recording images with a digital camera, the user must perform several operations, such as: selecting the image recording mode by operating the keys of the operation section provided on the portable terminal while confirming the settings on the display section of the terminal; pressing the define key to define the image recording mode; and then recording an image in the image recording mode. Furthermore, when the portable terminal is a portable telephone, for example, it is necessary to operate at least two keys, one key for switching from the sound mode of the telephone function to the image recording mode of the camera function, and another key to define a task in the selected mode. Further, it is necessary to provide operation keys required for image recording, for example, a key to function as the shutter button, and settings keys to specify recording conditions and others. Therefore, the number of keys to be operated such as switching to the recording mode and operating the camera are increased, resulting in a problem that, when one is ready to record a picture, some time is spent in operating the<br><br>
4<br>
keys before reaching the stage of defining the recording mode. And, to define the image recording mode, it is necessary to select the image recording mode first and then to operate the definition keys, so that the user is required to view the display section of the portable terminal while operating the keys to define parameters of the image recording mode, so that the problems are not only complex key operations but missed an opportunity for recording good images.<br>
The present invention is provided in view of the background information present above, and an object one is to provide a portable information terminal that enables to communicate data with an external device in a highly convenient manner because of its simplified cable connection.<br>
An object two is to provide a user-friendly digital camera that enables to freely change the direction of image recording without making the camera structure complex for use with a portable information terminal having an earphone jack for sound input/output, and a portable information terminal for use with such a digital camera, and a digital camera/information terminal combination system.<br>
And, by virtue of the fact that a portable information terminal is already provided with an earphone jack for sound input/output purposes so that this jack can be used for transferring data purposes, so that an object three is to provide a portable information terminal and a digital camera for the information terminal and a portable digital camera/information terminal system that does not require a special connection device or expensive interfaces.<br>
An object four is to provide a portable information terminal, and a digital camera for the portable information terminal and a portable digital camera/information terminal system that enables to transmit image data easily, rapidly and efficiently using serial transmission in particular.<br>
An object five is to provide a portable information terminal and a method for controlling the portable information terminal that can be operated using a lesser number of keys without the need to look at the screen in the display section and without providing a dedicated key for image recording.<br>

In a case where there is only one data line each, it is not possible to operate the digital camera from the portable information terminal, so that it is preferable to provide a memory of sufficient capacity to store image data that would be transmitted from the digital camera. Also, in addition to the two contacts, by providing a contact for transmitting data for the portable information terminal and a contact for receiving data for the digital camera, it becomes possible to operate the digital camera from the portable information terminal. In this case, when the portable information terminal recognizes that the digital camera has been connected as an external device, internal circuits of the portable information terminal are switched to functions to serve the digital camera so that the digital camera can be operated from the portable information terminal by having the operation section becoming the digital camera operation section, for example. The contacts in each are at most three, so that the earphone jack of the existing portable information terminal may be adopted as it is for use, and there is no need for providing a special terminal.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail in the following.<br>
Figure 1 shows a digital camera for use with a portable information terminal (referred simply as the digital camera in the following), 1A-1D are, respectively, a front view, a side view, a bottom view and a perspective view of the digital camera for the portable information terminal in Embodiment 1-1<br>
Figure 2 shows an exploded perspective view of the digital camera in this embodiment. The digital camera is comprised by: a top cover 2; infra-red absorbing filter 3; a lens-barrel 4 construct the lens system of the camera; a holder 5 for positioning the lens-barrel 4 and blocking light from outside of the optical axis to the imaging element; a reflection prevention film 6 for eliminating harmful reflection light; a CMOS-IC7 for processing imaging element and image data; a base plate 8 for mounting IC7 and other electronic parts; and a bottom cover 9.<br>
On the lower surface of the top cover 2 and the bottom cover 9, semi-circular cutout sections 2a, 9a are provided. Behind each of the cutout sections 2a and 9a, support plates 2b, 9b are provided, and each cutout further has respective support plates 2b, 9b having a cutout each. Here, CMOS-IC7 may be replaced with a CCD-IC.<br>
The plug 10 is attached to the camera body by inserting the bottom section of the base section 10a of the plug 10 between the cutouts 9a 9b of the lower cover 9 and assembling the parts 2-8, placing the top cover 2 and inserting the top section of the base section 10a between the cutout 2a and the support plate 2b. Arranged in sequence in the plug 10 are, from the base section 10a side, a contact for power supply 11a, a contact for a ground 11b, a contact for transferring a clock signal 11c, a contact for transferring data 11d. The top cover 2 and the lower cover 9 are fixed by screws (not shown). The structure may be fixed without using screws.<br>
The center axis 10b of the plug 10 is oriented so that it is at right angles to the optical axis (optical axis of the lens-barrel) 4a of the lens. A mound section 12 is formed<br><br>
19<br>
as a part of the upper and lower covers surrounding the plug 10. The mound section 12 is a portion that protrudes from the bottom surface of the base section periphery, and it is preferable that it has a convex-shape so that the amount of protrusion decreases gradually as the tip extends from the base section periphery of the plug 10.<br>
Light from the image object propagating through the lens window 2c of the top cover 2 is injected into the lens-barrel 4 by way of the infrared absorbing filter 3, and is focused onto the imaging element CMOS-1C7. Imaging signals accumulated in the imaging elements are converted to electrical signals, processed in the CMOS-1C7, and transmitted to plug 10. Here, it is assumed that the imaging signals are output after being corrected for white balance.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram to explain the connection state of the digital camera.<br>
An earphone jack 11 is provided on the right side surface 13c of the portable telephone 13.<br>
A liquid crystal display section 24 is disposed on the front, and an antennae 13b is provided on the top surface.<br>
By inserting the plug10 of the digital camera 1 into the earphone jack 11 in the direction shown in Figure 3, digital camera 1 is connected electrically to the portable phone 13 and is mechanically fixed in place.<br>
The earphone jack 11 for connecting the plug 10 can be rotated 360 degrees about the terminal axis 10b, as indicated by a bi-directional arrow A, because both terminals are circular shaped. For this reason, with reference to the front surface of the portable telephone 13 having the display section 13c, the lens window 2c of the digital camera 1 can be rotated to any direction in the direction A shown in Figure 3. That is, the lens optical axis (image recording direction) of the digital camera 1 that intersects the plug 10 at right angles, can be pointed to any direction within a range of rotation of 360 degrees with respect to the liquid crystal display section 24.<br>
Also, the mound section 12 provided on the bottom surface of the digital camera touches the peripheral side surface of the earphone jack 11 to slide this section. Accordingly, the distance of protrusion of the digital camera 1 from the portable phone 13 can be minimized, and, the contact area to the portable phone 13 can also be minimized. As a result, the size of the overall apparatus can be made compact, and sliding action to change the recording direction of the digital camera 1 in the connected condition about the terminal axis 10b is facilitated.<br><br>
20<br>
Further, because the periphery section la of the mound section 12 of the digital camera is distanced away from the side surface 13c of the portable telephone 13, if a digital camera has a lid for the earphone jack 11, the digital camera can be rotated without interfering with the lid of the earphone jack 11 so that the lid does not prevent the digital camera to be seated properly.<br>
Next, the internal circuit configuration of the digital camera 1 when it is connected to the portable information terminal in Embodiment 1-1 will be shown in Figure 4. Here, the portable information terminal is represent by a portable telephone (including PHS) in this embodiment.<br>
In the drawing, the digital camera 1 is comprised by; an imaging section 14; an AD conversion section 15; a signal processing section 16; a buffer memory section 17 and an I/F (interface) section 18. In this case, the buffer memory section 17 has a capacity to store one sheet of image, and the memory section 20 is comprised by a semiconductor memory and cards and the like. It should be noted that the image data can be output directly to the portable telephone 13 without storing in the buffer memory 17.<br>
On the other hand, the portable telephone 13 is comprised by: an I/F section 19 for transferring data between an external device connected through the earphone jack 11; a memory section 20 including ROM, RAM containing various programs and fixed data, an antennae (not shown); an RF transceiver section 21 for transferring sound signals and other data between a destination terminal through a base station; a signal processing section 22 primarily for processing data; an operation section having various keys such as those in a ten-key panel; a liquid crystal display section 24 for displaying various data; a switching section 25 for switching the interface section 19 according to the type of external device; and a CPU 26 for controlling each section by executing the programs stored in the memory section 20.<br>
The interface section 19 is provided with a sound interface (I/F) 19a and an imaging interface (I/F) 19b. The sound I/F 19a responds to analogue sound signals input from an externally connected device such as earphone microphone or stereo headphone, and converts such analogue signals to digital signals that can be processed inside the portable telephone and outputs the converted data to signal processing section 22, or converts digital sound data output from the memory section 20 or signal processing section 22 to analogue data and outputs such data to the external device through the earphone jack 11.<br><br>
21<br>
On the other hand, when the digital camera 1 as the external device is connected to the earphone jack 11, the imaging interface 19b ensures that the data handled by the digital camera 1 and the portable telephone 13 are compatible. That is, image data input from the earphone jack 11 are converted to data that can be processed by the portable telephone and output the processed data to the signal processing section 22, or digital data output from the signal processing section 22 are converted to data that can be processed by the digital camera 1 and output processed data to the digital camera 1 through the earphone jack 11.<br>
The signal processing section 22 is a circuit specializing in processing digitized data such as sound data and image data at high speeds, and may be comprised by a DSP (digital signal processor), for example.<br>
The liquid crystal display section 24 displays various settings of the telephone functions of the portable telephone and various menus as well as various information related to various external devices (earphone and stereo headphone and the like) when an external device is connected through the earphone jack.<br>
Also, a ROM is a part of the memory and stores various programs for executing telephone functions, control programs and various fixed data, and CPU 26 controls various sections of the portable telephone 13 by executing such programs. Also, a RAM (not shown) temporarily stores data processed by the signal processing section 22, data processed by CPU 26 and various externally input data.<br>
The switching section 25 identifies a device when it is connected to the earphone jack 11, and switches to an interface appropriate to the device being connected.<br>
More specifically, when the switching section 25 detects that a plug is connected to the earphone jack 11, it determines a device type by detecting a value of the resistance between the second and third contacts at the tip of the connected plug, and determines the device type based on this value.<br>
In the following, the process of identifying an externally connected device by the switching section 22 will be explained using specific examples of connecting the digital camera 1, an earphone microphone, and a stereo headphone to the earphone jack 11.<br>
Figure 7 shows an example of connecting an earphone microphone plug, and Figure 8 shows an example of connecting a stereo headphone. The earphone plug shown in Figure 7 has four contacts consisting of a contact for a power supply 71, a contact for a ground 72, a contact for receiving sound data (a contact for an earphone) 73, a contact for<br><br>
22<br>
transmitting sound data (a contact for a microphone) 74, and of these four contacts, the resistance value between the contact for the ground 72 and the contact for receiving sound data 73 is different than the resistance value between the contact for the ground 72 and the contact for transmitting sound data 74. In contrast, the stereo headphone shown in Figure 8 has four contacts consisting of a vacant contact 81, a. contact for a ground 82, a contact for receiving stereo (L) sound data 83, and a contact for receiving stereo (R) sound data 84, and of the four contacts, the resistance value between the contact for the ground 82 and the contact for the receiving stereo (L) sound data 83 and the resistance value between the contact for the ground 82 and the contact for receiving the stereo (R) sound data 84 are about equal. It should be noted that in the plugs of the earphone microphone and stereo headphone, the terminals are not insulated from each other.<br>
Also, for the plug 10 of the digital camera 1 shown in Figure 2, the ground section 11b is insulated from the contact for transferring the clock signal 11e so that the resistance value between these terminal is infinite.<br>
Accordingly, the switching section 25 detects a resistance value between contact-2 and contact-3, and if this value is infinite, it is determined that the digital camera 1 is connected, and if it is not infinite, either the earphone microphone or the stereo headphone is connected, so that it further detects a resistance value between the two terminals described above for comparison. If the result of detection shows that the resistance values are identical, it is determined that the connected device is the stereo headphone and if the detected resistance values are different, it is determined that the connected device is the earphone microphone.<br>
As described above, when the switching section 25 determines that the connected device is the digital camera 1, the I/F section 19 selects the imaging interface to correspond to image data so as to enable data communication between the digital camera 1 and the portable telephone 13 through the imaging interface 19b. Also, when the imaging interface 19b is selected, operation keys (not shown) provided on the operation section 23 of the portable telephone 13 function as function keys predetermined for the digital camera 1. Here, image data are processed serially.<br>
Further, in addition to its automatic ability to detect the connection by the digital camera 1 and selecting the imaging interface, the switching section 25 described above may be made to identify that an external device is the digital camera 1 when the user performs a certain operation (mode switching, for example). Also, in this embodiment, the<br><br>
23<br>
switching section 25 may be provided on the digital camera 1 side.<br>
Figure 5 shows a flowchart for the process from the stage of preparing for image recording to the stage of transmitting image information.<br>
In Figure 5 A, the portable telephone 13 is in the normal operational state (S501). In this state, the plug 10 of the digital camera 1 is inserted and coupled to the earphone jack 11 (S502). The current state is set to the camera mode (S503). The CPU 26 of the portable telephone determines whether telephone operation is enabled, and if the telephone operation is enabled, the flow returns to S501 (S504). If the telephone operation is not enabled, it determines whether the digital camera 1 is enabled (S505). If it is not enabled, the flow returns to S504. If the digital camera 1 is ready to receive image data, image data are read-in (S506).<br>
On the other hand, if in Figure 5B, the digital camera 1 connected to the portable telephone performs initialization (S512), and the recorded images are processed to output the image data to the portable telephone 13 side through the plug 10 (S513, S514). Then, the flow determines whether the camera mode is in the off-state (S515), and if it is off, the process is finished. In S507 in Figure 5A, the image output from the digital camera 1 is displayed on the liquid crystal screen of the liquid crystal display section 24. Next, flow determines whether the user has performed the operation to store the image (S508), and if the store operation has been indicated, the image data are transmitted from the digital camera 1 through the plug 10, the earphone jack 11, and the I/F section 19 to the portable telephone 13 (S509), and the image data are stored in RAM of memory section 20 (S510). Next, the flow determines whether the operation to transmit the recorded image data (S511), and if the transmitting operation has been indicated, the process enters telephone operation in S504, and transmits the image data. If the transmitting operation has not been indicated, the flow returns to the normal terminal operation in S501.<br>
Next, an example of using the digital camera 1 by attaching it to the portable telephone 13 will be explained. Figure 6A illustrates a case of directing the lens window 2c of the digital camera 1 towards the recording object 27 opposing the user, and recording the image while the user views the image displayed on the liquid crystal display section 24 of the portable telephone 13. In this case, the digital camera 520 is mechanically supported as a terminal by the portable telephone 13, so that one-hand operation is possible.<br>
Also, Figure 6B illustrates a case of directing the lens window 2c of the digital<br><br>
24<br>
camera 1 to the user himself holding the portable terminal apparatus attached to the digital camera, and recording an image of self as the recording object while the user views the self image displayed on the liquid crystal display section 24.<br>
As described above, according to the present portable terminal device for connecting the digital camera, the direction for image recording can be changed readily by rotating the digital camera about the plug axis.<br>
Also, by using a dedicated extension cable 50 having an earphone jack 11' on one end and a plug 10' on the other end, and connecting the plug 10 of the digital camera 1 to the earphone jack 11' of the dedicated extension cable 50, and inserting the plug 10' of the dedicated extension cable 50 in the earphone jack 11 of the portable information terminal, the digital camera 1 can be manipulated in complete freedom. Also, by providing a holder 31 on the digital camera 1, inserting the dedicated extension cable 50 through a strap hole 40 provided originally on the portable information terminal and through the holder 31 of the digital camera 1, and inserting the plug 10' of the dedicated extension cable 50 into the earphone jack 11', the digital camera 1 can be attached to the portable information terminal to facilitate its carrying. The shape of the holder 31 are not particularly restricted so long as the opening is sufficiently large to permit the strap to pass through, and such a holder may be placed in any suitable location.<br>
Also, in the above embodiments, by providing a knob 32 linked to the plug 10 and a guide 33 for freely movably supporting the knob 32 along the center axis 10b of the plug 10, as shown in Figure 11, the plug 10 can be kept with the camera body. Further, by providing a cover for protecting the lens window 2c and linking the lens cover to the knob 32, leans cover may be made detachable by moving the knob 32. Such an arrangement permits to keep the plug 10 with the camera body as well as to place the cover over the lens window 2c.<br>
It is also possible to provide a sensor to detect that the digital camera 1 has been inverted so as to invert the recorded image on the digital camera or on the portable information terminal.<br>
Also, the portable information terminal may be constructed so that location information may be attached to recorded image data by receiving such information from a base station to enable later to identify the location of the recorded image.<br>
Next, the portable information terminal in Embodiment 1-2 will be explained.<br>
In the example shown in Embodiment 1-1, the plug 10 of the digital camera 1 is<br><br>
25<br>
connected to the earphone jack 11, but in this embodiment, the earphone jack 11 is connected to a connector of the USB (universal serial bus) cable to enable highspeed data transmission with personal computer and the like.<br>
Figure 12 shows the USB cable 100 to be used in this embodiment. As shown in this diagram, a connector 101 of the USB cable 100 has a shape to enable to connect to the earphone jack 11. The connector 101 has four contacts, which are arranged from the tip end, a first data transmit/receive contact 174, a second data transmit/receive contact 173, a ground contact 172, a power supply contact 171. The USB cable is electrically connected and mechanically fixed to the portable telephone 13 by inserting the connector into the earphone jack 11 provided on the right side surface 13c (refer to Figure 3) of the portable telephone 13 from the direction shown in Figure 3. Also, by making a circular cross sectional shape for the connector 101, the connector 101 can be rotated 360 degrees about the center line 101b of the connector 100 as its axis of rotation.<br>
Here, the other connector 102 at the opposite end of the USB cable 100 is connected to an upstream device such as a personal computer, and various data exchanged between the external device and the portable information terminal may include sound data, image data and text data and the like.<br>
Also, of the contact provided on the connector 101, the ground contact 172 and the power supply contact 173 may be left vacant if the power is not to be supplied from an external device.<br>
Next, the internal circuit of portable information terminal in this embodiment is shown in Figure 13. Similar to Embodiment 1-1, the portable phone (includes PHS) is used as the portable information terminal.<br>
As shown in the diagram, the portable telephone 13 has a similar structure as the portable telephone 13 shown in Figure 4 but the internal construction of the interface section 119 is different.<br>
In this embodiment, the connector 101 of the USB cable 100 is connected to the earphone jack 11 so that an interface is necessary to match the data output from the USB cable 100 and the data processed by the portable telephone. For this reason, instead of the imaging interface 19b used in Embodiment 1-1, a USB interface 19c for converting data output from USB cable 100 and the data processed by the portable telephone 13 is provided in the interface section 119. And, when USB cable 100 is connected to the earphone jack 11, the switching section 125 connects output of earphone jack 11 to the<br><br>
26<br>
USB interface 19c, and when the earphone microphone or stereo head phone is connected, the output of the earphone jack 11 is directed to the sound interface 19a.<br>
Here, the switching section 125, upon detecting that the user has operated a certain function of the operation section 123, mode switching for example, carries out the process of discriminating the external device (a device connected to the earphone jack 11, in this case, USB cable 100). It is possible to automatically recognize an external device by inputting a specific signal output from an external device through the USB cable 100 and providing a further function to the switching section 125 to recognize the predetermined signal, which shows that the USB cable 100 is connected. In such a case, the specific signal should be a signal that has been predetermined for the portable telephone and the external device.<br>
Next, the operation of the portable telephone 113 will be explained.<br>
First, with the portable telephone 113 in the normal enabled state, the user inserts USB connector 101 into the earphone jack 11 of the portable telephone 113 to obtain electrical and mechanical connections, and the current state is set to USB mode.<br>
By so doing, a signal to report that the mode setting has been changed to USB mode is transmitted to CPU 126 of the portable telephone 113. CPU 126, recognizing that the mode setting has been changed to USB mode, determines whether USB cable is connected to the earphone jack 11. If the result indicates that such a connection has been made, CPU 126 outputs a signal to the switching section 126 to notify that USB mode is set, and the switching section 125 then selects USB interface 19c as the output interface for the earphone jack 11. When actual data transmission is commenced, the data input from the earphone jack 11 are output to the signal processing section 122 through the USB interface 19c, and the processing section 122 processes the input data, and the processed data are stored as necessary in RAM in the memory section 120.<br>
On the other hand, when an instruction is given by the user to transmit the data from the operation section 123 of the portable telephone 113, the signal processing section 122 reads specified data from RAM or ROM of the memory section 120, and the readout data are output to USB cable through the USB interface 19c and the earphone jack 11. By so doing, required data can be transmitted to the external device through the USB cable.<br>
Next, a portable information terminal in Embodiment 1-3 will be explained. The portable information terminal in this embodiment has the function provided for the portable telephone 13 described in Embodiment 1-1 as well as the function provided for<br><br>

the portable telephone 113 described in Embodiment 1-2. That is, this portable information terminal is able to be connected to an earphone microphone, an stereo headphone, an digital camera 1 and USB cable as external devices through the earphone jack 11. Therefore, the portable information terminal in this embodiment is provided with a sound interface 19a, an imaging interface 19b and a USB interface 19c in the interface section 219, as shown in Figure 14, and these interfaces are switched according to the type of external device connected to the earphone jack 11. Accordingly, a portable information terminal of even higher convenience can be provided.<br>
Next, a digital camera and a portable information terminal in Embodiment 2 will be explained. Here, a portable telephone (includes PHS) represents the portable information terminal.<br>
Figure 15 shows an illustration of a portable information terminal and a digital camera in Embodiment 2. In this illustration, a reference numeral 510 relates to the portable telephone and a reference numeral 520 relates to the digital camera.<br>
The digital camera 520 has a lens window 522 in the center section of the camera body 521, and a plug 523 protrudes from the bottom surface 521a that intersects the optical axis of the lens (not shown) inside the lens window 522, for example. The plug 523 has two contacts, contact for transferring a clock signal 525a and a contact for transmitting data 525b, or in addition to these two contacts, a third contact, a contact for receiving data 525c, is provided.<br>
The portable telephone 510 has a display section 510 such as a liquid crystal display on the telephone body 511, an antennae 513, a jack 514 on a side surface 511a. The jack 514 is provided with two contacts, one for receiving data and another for transferring a clock signal to correspond to the plug 523 of the digital camera 520 described above, or in addition to these two contacts, a third contact, for transmitting data. Here, it is preferable that the earphone microphone jack provided on an existing portable telephone is used for the jack.<br>
When the plug 523 of the digital camera 520 is inserted into the earphone jack 514 of the portable telephone 510, the contacts of the plug 523 and the jack 414 contact other contacts of the same kind at specific insertion locations to enable to transfer signals. Accordingly, a portable combined digital camera/information terminal system is provided comprised by the portable telephone 510 and the digital camera 520 connected mechanically and electrically.<br><br>
28<br>
Next, the circuit configuration of the portable digital camera connecting apparatus will be explained with reference to Figure 16.<br>
As shown in Figure 16, the portable telephone 510 is comprised by: an I/F interface section 510a for transferring data with an external device; a memory section 510b for storing various data; an RF processing section 510c for processing data through an antennae; a signal processing section 510d for processing transmit/receive signals; and an operation section 510e comprised by a 10-key board and function keys and others to be operated by the user; a display section 512 served by a liquid crystal display section 510f; and a control section 510g for controlling various sections of the portable telephone 510; and further, a jack having a contact for transferring a clock signal 527a for transferring various data with the external device; and a contact for receiving data 527b for receiving data. Further, by providing a contact for transmitting data 527c for transmitting data in the earphone jack 514, data may be transmitted to the external device as required.<br>
The control section 510 is structured as a logic circuit operated primarily by a microcomputer, and comprises CPU, ROM, RAM and the like. CPU executes certain computations according to predetermined programs. ROM stores control programs and control data required for executing various programs by CPU, and similarly RAM is used to temporarily store and output various data required for the CPU to execute various computations.<br>
The digital camera 520 is comprised by: an imaging section 520a having an imaging element such as CCD (charge coupled device); an AD conversion section 520b for converting image data produced by analogue signals to digital signals; a control section 520c for controlling various sections of the digital camera 520 and processing image data; an I/F section 520e for transferring data to and from the buffer memory section 520d that stores image data, as well as to and from an externally connected device; a contact for transferring a clock signal 525a; and a contact for transmitting data 525b. The buffer memory 520d has a capacity to store one sheet of image, and the memory section 510b comprises a semiconductor memory and cards and the like.<br>
The control section 520c is structured as a logic circuit operated primarily by a microcomputer, and comprises CPU, ROM, RAM and the like. CPU executes certain computations according to predetermined programs. ROM stores control programs and control data required for executing various programs by CPU, and similarly RAM is used to temporarily store and output various data required for the CPU to execute various<br><br>
29<br>
computations.<br>
Also, corresponding to the earphone jack 514 of the portable telephone, the plug 523 is constructed with two contacts, contact for transferring a clock signal 525a and a contact for transmitting data 525b, but by further providing a contact for receiving data 525c transmitted from an external device may be received.<br>
Next, when the plug of the digital camera 520 is inserted into the jack of the portable information terminal 510 thereby connecting the two electrically, the processes are carried out by both the portable information terminal 510 and the digital camera 520, which will be described with reference to Figures 17-21.<br>
First, a case will be described with reference to Figures 17, 18, in which there are two contacts between the portable telephone and the digital camera 520, that is, the portable telephone 510 has the contact for transferring a clock signal 527a and the contact for receiving data 527b and the digital camera 520 has the contact for transferring a clock signal 525a and the contact for transmitting data 525b. In this case, two possibilities exist, one is to supply a clock signal from the digital camera 520 and other is to supply a clock signal from the portable telephone 510. <digital camera supplies a clock signal><br>
First, Figure 17 shows a timing chart for a clock signal and corresponding output data when the portable telephone 510 and the digital camera 520 are electrically connected and the a clock signal is supplied from the digital camera 520 side to the portable telephone 510 side.<br>
As shown in these diagrams, when the plug 523 of the digital camera 520 is connected at time t0 to the earphone jack 514 of the portable telephone 510 so that the two are connected electrically, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 outputs a clock signal from the contact for transferring the clock signal 525a (refer to Figure 17A), and arbitrary data are output from the contact for transmitting data 525b (refer to Figure<br>
17B).<br>
According to such a process, a clock signal is input in the control section 510g of the portable telephone 510 through the contact for transferring the clock signal 527 and the I/F section 510a, and arbitrary data are input through the contact for receiving data 527b and the I/F section 510a. In this case, arbitrary data refer to any random data, not to the data that are specifically prearranged between the digital camera and portable telephone.<br><br>
30<br>
Then, upon detecting the clock signal and data, the control section 510g determines that the external device being connected at this time is the digital camera 520, and the control section 510g stores image data output from the digital camera and input by way of the contact for transmitting data 525b, 527b in the memory section 510b inside the portable telephone 510, and displays the image received on the liquid crystal display section 510f.<br>
Here, image data after being stored in the memory section 510f of the portable telephone 510 can freely be displayed on the liquid crystal display section 510f or deleted by the user performing certain operations using the operation section 510e. <portable telephone supplies a clock signal><br>
Next, Figure 18 shows a timing chart for a clock signal and corresponding output data when the portable telephone 510 and the digital camera 520 are electrically connected and the clock signal is supplied from the portable telephone 510 side to the digital camera 520 side.<br>
As shown in these diagrams, when the plug 523 of the digital camera 520 is connected at time t0 to the earphone jack 514 of the portable telephone 510 so that the two are connected electrically, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 is supplied with a clock signal through the contact for transferring a clock signal 527a of the portable telephone 510 and the contact for transferring a clock signal 525a and the I/F section 520e of the digital camera (refer to Figure 18A).<br>
Upon receiving the clock signal, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 outputs data of predetermined format from the data line section 525a. For example, if "AA55" is set as such formatted data, the digital camera 520 outputs signals shown in Figure 21 to the portable telephone 510 through the contact for transmitting data 525a. Specifically, the control section 520c outputs predetermined data in "AA55" format to the portable telephone 510 in synchronization with the input a clock signal. Accordingly, data of a specific format is input into the portable telephone 510 through the data line section 527b and the I/F section 510a.<br>
In the above description, predetermined data are not limited to 8-bit data described above, but may include any type of data so long as the data can be matched between the portable telephone 510 and the digital camera 520.<br>
If the data obtained by the control section 510g is the predetermined data, it determines that the external device being connected at this time is the digital camera 520,<br><br>
31<br>
and stores image data transmitted from the digital camera 520 through the data line sections 525b, 527b in the memory section 510b of the portable telephone 510, and displays received image data on the liquid crystal display section 510f.<br>
Here, image data after being stored in the memory section 510b of the portable telephone 510 can freely be displayed on the liquid crystal display section 510f or deleted by the user performing certain operations using the operation section 510e.<br>
On the other hand, when data different than the predetermined format are input or no data are input, it is determined that the external device being connected at this time is not the digital camera.<br>
The next case will be an example in which the portable telephone 510 and the digital camera 520 are connected through three contacts. That is, the portable telephone 510 has a contact for transferring a clock signal 527a, a contact for receiving data 527b and a contact for transmitting data 527c, while the digital camera 520 has a contact for transferring a clock signal 525a, a contact for transmitting data 525b and the contact for receiving data 525c.<br>
Here, in this case also, there are two ways of supplying the a clock signal: the digital camera 520 side supplies a clock signal or the portable telephone 510 side supplies a clock signal. <digital camera supplies a clock signal><br>
Figure 19 shows a timing chart for a clock signal and corresponding output data when the portable telephone and the digital camera are electrically connected and the a clock sienal are supplied from the digital camera to the portable telephone.<br><br>
32<br>
Then, when the control section 510g detects the clock signal and the data, it determines that the external device being connected at this time is the digital camera 520, and selects a circuit in the I/F section 510a to correspond to the image signals, and switches circuits.<br>
When the imaging circuit is selected, operation keys and the like provided on the operation section 510e of the portable telephone 510 function as predetermined function keys for the digital camera 520.<br>
Then, when the user operates the operation section 510e as keys for the digital camera, the control section 510g transmits signals corresponding to the operation to the digital camera 520 through the contact for transmitting data 527c (refer to Figure 19C). Then, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 can perform various processes corresponding to the operational data to execute the processes specified by the portable telephone 510 of the digital camera 520. <portable telephone supplies a clock signal><br>
Next, Figure 20 shows a timing chart for a clock signal and corresponding output data when the portable telephone and the digital camera are electrically connected and the a clock signal are supplied from the portable telephone to the digital camera.<br>
As shown in these diagrams, when the plug 523 of the digital camera 520 is connected at time t0 to the earphone jack 514 of the portable telephone 510 so that the two are connected electrically, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 is supplied with a clock signal through the contact for transferring a clock signal 527a of the portable telephone 510, the contact for transferring a clock signal 525a of the digital camera and the I/F section 520e (refer to Figure 20A).<br>
Upon receiving the clock signal, the control section 520c inside the digital<br>
camera 520 outputs data of predetermined format from the data line section 525a (Refer to<br>
Figure 20B). For example, if "AA55" is selected as such formatted data, the digital camera<br>
520 outputs signals shown in Figure 21 to the portable telephone 510 through the contact<br>
for transmitting data 525a.	Accordingly, data of a specific format is input into the<br>
portable telephone 510 through the data line section 527b and the I/F section 510a.<br>
Then, when the control section 510g determines the data, and if the data matches predetermined data, it is determined that the external device being connected at this time is the digital camera 520, and selects a circuit in the I/F section 510a to correspond to the image signals, and switches circuits.<br><br>
33<br>
When the imaging circuit is selected, operation keys and the like provided on the operation section 510e of the portable telephone 510 function as predetermined function keys for the digital camera 520.<br>
Then, when the user operates the operation section 510e as keys for the digital camera, the control section 510g transmits signals corresponding to the operation to the digital camera 520 through the contact for transmitting data 527c (refer to Figure 20C). Then, the control section 520c inside the digital camera 520 can perform various processes corresponding to the operational data to execute the processes specified by the portable telephone 510 of the digital camera 520.<br>
On the other hand, when data different than the predetermined format are input or no data are input, it is determined that the external device being connected at this time is not the digital camera, and the control section 510g does not perform any specific processes.<br>
Next, a portable information terminal and a digital camera for connecting to a portable information terminal in Embodiment 3 will be explained, this embodiment will be exemplified using a portable telephone (includes PHS) as a portable information terminal.<br>
Figure 22 shows a block diagram of the configuration of the portable information terminal and the digital camera for connecting to a portable information terminal.<br>
In the diagram, the portable telephone 630 stores or displays as necessary image data received from the digital camera 650 though a specific signal line. On the other hand, the digital camera 650 is operated by the power supplied from the portable telephone 630, and transmits recorded image data to the portable telephone 630 through a specific signal line. The portable telephone 630 and the digital camera 650 are connected by signal lines L1a~L1c, which are: a power line L1a for supplying power from the portable telephone 630 to the digital camera 650; a data request signal line L1b for outputting a request signal for image data from the portable telephone 630 to the digital camera 650; and a data output signal line L1e for outputting (transmitting) a transmit-ready signal and image data from the digital camera 650 to the portable telephone 630. Here, the signal lines L1a~L1c are connected to the earphone jack J1 of the portable telephone 630.<br>
Next, the structure of the portable telephone 630 will be explained.<br>
The telephone control section 602 has a function (terminal detecting section) to detect a transmit-ready signal to show readiness for transmitting image data output from the digital camera 650 through the data output line L1e; a function L1b (terminal side<br><br>
34<br>
output section) to output a transm it-request signal to the digital camera 650 through the data request signal line; and a function (receiving section) to receive image data transmitted from the digital camera 650 through the data output signal line L1e. Also, the telephone control section 602 controls on/off of power supplied to the digital camera 650 through the power line L1a. Further, the telephone control section 602 controls various section of the portable telephone 630. The telephone control section 602 is comprised by CPU, for example, and performs its functions by executing various programs for actualizing the function pre-stored in the memory section containing ROM and the like.<br>
The memory section 604 is a memory for storing information related to various functions of the portable telephone 630, and stores telephone numbers according to telephone book function or image data received from the digital camera 650 under the control of the telephone control section 602.<br>
The display section 606 displays operational states of various functions of the portable telephone 630, and displays for viewing as required, such information as telephone number of the transmitter and reception conditions at receiving times, residual battery power, and image data received from the digital camera 650.<br>
The power section 608 supplies power to various sections of the digital camera 650 and its on/off function of the power is controlled by the action of the telephone control section 602.<br>
The operation section 610 is used to execute various functions when using the phone or receiving image data from the digital camera 650, and is provided with alphanumeric keys for entering numbers and characters, and menu keys (not shown) to select various functions. Also, the radio section 670 is used to provide the telephone function for the portable telephone 630, and comprises a radio section 670a for processing radio signals, a speaker 670b, and a microphone 670c. The structure of the radio section 670 is the same as conventional portable telephone, and detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
Next, the structure of the digital camera 650 will be explained.<br>
The camera control section 622 is provided with: a function (camera side output section) to forward a transmit-ready signal to show that image data are ready to be transmitted to the portable telephone 630 through the data output signal line L1e; a function (camera side detection section) to detect a transmit-request signal to request image data to be transmitted from the portable telephone 630 through the data request signal line L1b; a function (transmitting section) to transmit image data to the portable<br><br>
35<br>
telephone 630 through the data output signal line L1e. Also, the control section 622 controls various sections of the portable telephone 630. The camera control section 622 is comprised by a CPU, for example, and performs its function by executing various programs pre-stored in ROM and the like to actualize the functions of the camera control section 622.<br>
The memory 624 stores image data recorded by the digital camera 650 successively, and the image data are stored successively as pictures, for example. Also, the imaging section 626 comprises imaging functions of the digital camera 650, and is provided with a lens and CCD (not shown) and the like, and records an image of the recording object under the direction of the camera control section 622. An image recorded by the imaging section 626 is processed by the camera control section 622, and is stored in the memory 624 as image data. Also, the digital camera 650 can record images automatically at given intervals under the direction of the camera control section 622, for example, and stores image data in the memory 624, and refreshes image data at the given intervals.<br>
Next, the process of transmitting image data from the digital camera 650 to the portable telephone 630 will be explained. Figure 23 shows a timing chart for transmitting image data from the digital camera 650 to the portable telephone 630. Image data S1 is comprised by a bulk image data equivalent to one picture of the digital camera, a header and an end marker. In this diagram, when a specified source voltage P [V] is supplied from the portable telephone 630 to the digital camera 650 through the power line L1a (at time t0), the digital camera 650 begins its operation, and the camera control section 622 changes the state of the output signal line L1e from a high impedance state (Hiz) to the H(igh)-state. By so doing, the digital camera 650 informs portable telephone 630 that it is preparing to transmit image data. At this time, the camera control section 622 initializes each section of the digital camera 650, and then processes a first picture recorded by the imaging section 626 (includes the process of writing image data in the memory 624) (an interval MO). During the interval M0, the data output signal line L1e (1) is maintained in the H-state. When the above processing is finished, the camera control section 622 changes the data output signal line L1e to the L(ow)-state, where L section signal transmit-ready signal (time tl). By so doing, the portable telephone 630 is notified that image data transmitting preparation is completed.<br>
The telephone control section 620 detects the L-state of the data output signal line<br><br>
36<br>
L1e, and outputs a specific signal successively to the digital camera 650, through the data request signal line L1b (time t2). Such a signal may be a clock signal (transmitting request signal) C1 corresponding to a bit count of the image data S1. When clock signal C1 is not being output, the data request signal line L1b is normally set in the L-state by the telephone control section 602.<br>
Responding to the clock signal C1, the camera control section 622 successively reads image data S1 stored in the memory 624 and outputs them to the data output signal line L1e. When image data S1 corresponding to one picture is output, the camera control section 622 returns the data output signal line L1e to the H-state (time t3), and informs the portable telephone 630 that it is in the image data transmitting preparation state. At this time, the camera control section 622 performs image processing of a second picture recorded by the imaging section 622 (includes writing image data for one picture into memory 624) (interval Ml). When the above process is finished, the camera control section 622 changes the data output signal line L1e to the L-state (time t4). By so doing, the portable telephone 630 is notified that image data transmitting preparation is completed. Henceforth, the processes between tl~t4 are repeated, and image data are transferred as needed. Accordingly, the camera control section 622 transmits image data in picture terminals, and image data are output after the transmit-ready signal (L-state for the data output signal line L1e) is issued, in response to the clock signal from the telephone control section 602.<br>
The telephone control section 602 successively receives image data output to the data output signal line L1e and writes the data into the memory 604, and when image data corresponding to one picture are written into the memory 604, displays the image data on the display section 606 for viewing. Also, if the image data from the digital camera 650 are to be stopped, the telephone control section 602 stops supplying the specified source voltage P [V] to the digital camera 650 (time tx) to stop the operation of the digital camera 650 so as not to receive any more image data. By so doing, the portable telephone 630 does not supply power to the digital camera so that it is possible to prevent wasting the battery of the portable telephone 630.<br>
On the other hand, if the portable telephone 630, for example, receives mail during image data reception, the telephone control section gives priority to mail reception so that transmitting of clock signal C2 is temporarily suspended (AMa, AMb), and the clock signal C2 is divided into clock signals C2a~C2c and are output. In response to<br><br>
37<br>
interruption of the clock signal C2, the camera control section 622 interrupts outputting of image data S2 (AMa, AMb). And, when outputting of clock signal C2 is resumed beginning with the clock signal (C2b and then C2c) that follows clock signal (C2a) that was transmitted just before the intermiption, and in response, the camera control section 622 successively outputs image data S2 (S2b, S2c) that follows data (S2a) that was transmitted just before the interruption. According to this procedure, even when the telephone control section 602 interrupts outputting of clock signal C2 temporarily in order to perform a task other than image data acquisition, interrupted image data S2 can be received in continuation by resuming to output the clock signal C2. Also, when the camera control section 622 renews (overwrites) the stored image data in the memory 624 at given intervals (0.2 seconds, for example) with the latest image data, if the interruption interval (AMa, ?Mb) becomes longer than the renewing interval of image data, then, during this interval, image data in the memory 624 are renewed by the latest image data. In such a case, a problem is created that the image data output from the camera control section 622 according to re-starting of outputting clock signal C2 by the telephone control section 602 are different than the image before the clock signal interruption. Therefore, in such a case., the camera control section 622 changes the data output signal line L1e to the H-state, and notifies the portable telephone 630 that it is in the image data transmitting preparation state. In the meantime, the telephone control section 602 detects a transmit-ready signal, and interrupts the process of re-starting reception of the interrupted image data S2 (re-starting clock signal C2 output). Then, when it detects a signal to show the transmitting allowed state (L-state of the data output line L1c), the telephone control section 602 is permitted to perform normal image data receiving process carried out during the interval tl~t4. By adopting such a procedure, it is possible to re-start image data reception without any difficulty, when the clock signal from the digital camera 650 has been interrupted longer than the image renewing interval of the digital camera 650.<br>
The structure of the image data (frame) will be explained with reference to Figure 24. In this diagram, image data S1 is comprised by a bulk image data 400b equivalent to one picture recorded by the digital camera 650 and a header 400a containing attributes for one picture and an end marker 400c to show the tail end of the image data S1.<br>
The relationship between a clock signal output and output timing of image data will be explained with reference to Figure 25. In this diagram, each bit data that constitute<br><br>
38<br>
image data S1, i.e., S1[0], Sl[l], ... Sl[n], where n is an integer, is output in response to the rise instant t2 [0] (t2[0]=t2), t2[l], ... t2[n] of clock signal C1. Also, an interval M2 is a time interval between the rise instant t2[n] of the clock signal C1 to the output time of each bit data Sl[n] of image data S1, an interval M3 is the width of the clock signal C1 in the H-state, and an interval M4 (M5) is a period of one cycle of the clock signal C1 (frequency). Also, clock signal C1 is output at a constant interval, but the period may sometimes vary between M4-M5, depending on the processing state of the telephone control section 602. In such cases, output timing of bit data Sl[n] of the image data S1 also varies accordingly (S1[1]~S1[2]).<br>
Here, the structure of the header 400a is as shown in Figure 26. For example, the header 400a is comprised of 32 bytes to indicate such items as: [dummy] for detection of abnormality in the received data to be described later; [image data start acknowledge]; bulk image data attributes such as [image width] and [image height] and the like.<br>
Here, so long as the clock signal from the telephone control section 602 is not interrupted, the camera control section 622 transmits data for each item of the header 400a as a whole as image data S1 (Figure 24). By so doing, handshake operation (steps for exchanging commands to confirm that transmitter and receiver are both in a state to begin transmit/receive operations), that has been necessary for each item of the header in the past, can now be performed in one step, so that the time required for handshake operation can be shortened.<br>
Also, the telephone control section 602 is able to detect abnormality in the received image data by checking the items in the header 400a of the image data S1, such as [dummy] data and [image data start acknowledge] data with predetermined values. For example, if [dummy] data of the received image data is "552A" (hexadecimal), it is different than a fixed value "AASS" (hexadecimal) so that it is detected as abnormal.<br>
Figure 27 shows an example of the data value of 2-byte end marker 400c. In this diagram, the end marker has its data value as "FFD9" (hexadecimal) and is the data to show the tail end of the image data S1.<br>
Figure 28 shows an example of the output sequence of the image data S1. In this diagram, following the header 400c, bulk image data 400b are transmitted successively and the end marker 400c is transmitted last.<br>
Here, the digital camera 650 in this embodiment may be mounted directly on the portable telephone 630 so as to terminal the two terminals. In such a case, there is no need<br><br>
39<br>
for a connecting cable, and provides an advantage of convenience of use.<br>
Also, the above embodiment represent an example of the use of clock signal to request image data to be transmitted from the portable information terminal to the digital camera, but data transmission technique is not limited to this case. For example, after notifying the portable information terminal of readiness to transmit image data from the digital camera, image data may be transmitted at suitable times from the digital camera. By so doing, the data request signal line between the portable information terminal and the digital camera becomes unnecessary to facilitate mutual connectivity, and to enable to reduce manufacturing cost by reducing the signal lines for connectors and cables. Also, the contents of header and end marker comprising the image data (frames) may be varied suitably depending on the type, function and portability of the digital camera and portable information terminal.<br>

request and others.<br>
The display section 706 displays settings and menu information for providing telephone functions of the portable information terminal 700, and image information such as recording parameters to be used when the camera 800 is connected to the portable information terminal.<br>
ROM 708 stores various programs for providing the telephone function and control programs as well as various fixed data.<br>
RAM 716 stores temporary data processed by CPU 712 and various data input externally through the external memory interface section 710.<br>
The camera 800 is comprised by: a digital camera 801 and a digital camera interface section 802, and can be connected to the portable telephone 700 using the earphone jack provided conventionally for the portable telephone 700. Figure 29 shows a block diagram of the portable telephone 700 connected to the camera 800, and the clock signal is supplied from the camera 800 to the portable telephone 700 side through the control line 730, and the control line 731 transmits control data from the portable telephone 700 side to the camera 800, and the signal line 732 transmits image data recorded by the digital camera 801.<br>
Control operations for switching the operational mode is performed by CPU 712, and this process will be explained with reference to the flowcharts shown in Figures 31, 32. The portable telephone 700 has two operational modes, sound mode and recording mode. The sound mode is the operational mode used when the portable telephone 700 operates as a telephone, and the recording mode enables image recording when the camera is connected to the portable telephone 700, by operating the keys of the operation section 704 of the portable telephone 700.<br>
When the power key in the operation section 704 is operated, in Figures 31, 32, operational mode of the portable telephone 700 is set to the sound mode and the telephone function is enabled (step S300). Next, in step S301, it is determined whether the camera 800 is connected to the portable telephone 700. The discrimination process for the connection of camera 800 may be made by providing a detection device to detect the connection of connector to the earphone jack of the portable telephone 700, and a detection signal is accessed and used for the determination. Or, the determination may be made according to whether a signal, to be output from the digital camera 801 of the camera 800 to the portable telephone 700 side through the digital camera interface section<br><br>
41<br>
802, has been output or not. It is of course permissible to use other methods.<br>
If it is determined in step S301 that the camera 800 is not connected to the portable telephone 700, the flow advances to step S312, and the process is terminated leaving the setting in the sound mode..<br>
Also, if in step S301, it is determined that the camera 800 is connected to the portable telephone 700, then, in step S302, it is determined whether a key in the operations section 740 normally specified for communication function (telephone function in this embodiment) of the portable telephone 700 has been operated. In this embodiment, this key is assumed to the F-key, for example.<br>
The F-key is normally used in combination with numeric keys for a specific function of the telephone functions, but it is assumed in this case that the F-key is assigns for switching the sound mode to the recording mode when the camera 800 is connected to the portable telephone 700. If it is determined, in step S302, that the F-key as the mode switching key has been operated, and further in step S303, it is determined whether or not the F-key has been pressed for the long-press that requires the key to be pressed for a specific duration. If it is determined, in step S302, that the F-key has not been operated, and in step S303, that the F-key has been pressed for the short-press that requires the key to be pressed for a shorter duration than the specific duration, then the flow advanced to step S312, and the process is terminated with the setting remaining in the sound mode.<br>
In step S303, if it is determined that the F-key has been pressed for the long-press that requires the key to be pressed for the specific duration, the flow changes to the recording mode that permits the camera 800 to be operated by the keys in the operation section 704 of the portable telephone 700 (step S304). At this point, reflected light from the recording object is received in the recording section (not shown) of the digital camera 801, and is converted into image data in the recording section to correspond to the brightness of the recording object, and the image data of the recording object are output from the signal line 732 to the portable telephone 700 side, through the digital camera interface section 802, in synchronization with the clock signals output from the control line 730. CPU 712 accesses the image data through the portable terminal interface section 714, and transmits the image data to the display section 706.<br>
The result is that the image based on the image data output from the digital camera 801 is displayed on the display section 706 of the portable telephone 700 (step S305). Continuing, in step S306, it is determined whether the F-key has been pressed for<br><br>
42<br>
mode change. If it is determined, in step S306, that the F-key has been operated, it is determined in step S307 whether the F-key has been pressed for the short-press. If it is determined that the F-key has been pressed for the short-press, this key functions as the shutter key, and the digital camera 801 records an image of the recording object (step S308), and the recorded still image is displayed on the display section 706 (step S309).<br>
On the other hand, if it is determined, in step S307, that the F-key has been pressed for the long-press, the mode is shifted from the recording mode to the sound mode (step S313), the process is terminated. The state of the portable telephone 700 in the sound mode corresponds to a certain state demanded by a state of input-key. Here, a certain state relates to a state enabled by an input-key such as a start call operation, parameter settings for telephone function or data communication function, composing mails and telephone number entries.<br>
After the still image recorded in step S309 is displayed on the display section 706, it is determined whether the recording process is finished (step S310). This determination may be based on assigning the finish-key in the operation section 704 as the end-recording key when the recording mode is active, and the determination is made according to whether or not the finish-key has been operated.<br>
If it is determined, in step S310, that the recording process is finished, the flow changes to the sound mode (step S311), and this process is terminated. Or, if it is determined, in step S310, that the recording process is not finished, the flow returns to step S306, and the process described above is repeated.<br>
Here, the portable information terminal in this embodiment may be operated in such a way that when a mail is received while the terminal is in the recording mode, the mode changes to mail receive mode.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, a certain key in the operation section 704 assigned normally to the telephone function is used as the mode switching key for switching between the sound mode and the recording mode when the camera 800 is connected to the portable telephone 700, and furthermore, when the terminal is in the recording mode, this key is used as a function key to provide functions related to recording operations, for example, the shutter key, however, instead of assigning only one key to functions related to recording operations, several different keys may be assigned to functions related to image recording.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, shutter key is selected to represent a function related to<br><br>
43<br>
image recording operations, but it is not limited to such a choice and the key may be assigned to perform other functions such as zoom operation or setting recording conditions.<br>
Further, before or after changing to the recording mode, switching from the sound mode and the recording mode, or from the recording mode to the sound mode may be carried out by either the short-press method or the long-press method, so long as such an operation can be distinguished from other operations.<br>
The present invention has been embodied by examples shown above with reference to the diagrams, however, specific structures are not limited to these examples, and designs without departing from the essence of the present invention are included.<br>
