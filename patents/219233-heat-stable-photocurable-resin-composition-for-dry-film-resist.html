Heat stable photocurable resin composition for drv film resists<br>
The present invention relates to heat stable photocurable resin composition and to the use of this composition as a photosensitive layer for a dry film resist.<br>
The so-called "dry film resists" are three-ply films which are produced by sandwiching a photocurable resin composition layer between a support film and a protective film. The photocurable resin composition is usually   The unexposed portion are removed with an aqueous alkali solution upon development.<br>
The photosensitive layer of dry film resists includes color formers that generate color after UV exposure and let the worker easily recognize if the resist is already exposed. Typically leuco crystal violet or leuco malachite green has been used as the color former for a dry film resist. Because their thermal stability is not sufficient, color is generated while thermally laminating the photocurable resin composition onto a substrate. This undesired color generation during the lamination process reduces the color contrast between exposed and unexposed area.<br><br>
/thus, it is<br>
is an object of the invention to reduce the undesired color generation during heat lamination process and get a clear color contrast between exposed and unexposed area.<br>
It has now been found that the unfavourable color generation during the heat lamination process is minimized when using a leuco dye as described below.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to a process for preparing a dry film resist by forming a photo¬curable resin composition onto a support film with a thickness of 1 to 50 pm and optionally laminate a protective film onto the photocurable composition layer to obtain a dry film resist; whereby the photocurable resin is formed from a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
(a)	from 20-90wt% of an alkaline soluble binder oligomer or polymer;<br>
(b)	from 5 to 60wt% of one or more photopolymerizable monomers which are compatible with the oligomers and polymers of component (a);<br>
(c)	from 0.01 to 20% by weight of one or more photoinitiator;<br>
(d)	from 0 to 20% by weight of additives and/or assistants; and<br>
(e)	from 0.1 to 10 % by weight of a leuco triphenylmethane dye of the formula I<br><br><br><br><br>

Examples of copolymers are copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and with styrene or substituted styrene.<br>
‘<br><br>
)henolic resins, for example novolak, (poly)hydroxystyrene, and copolymers of hydroxy-Jtyrene with alkyl acrylates, acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid.   Preferable examples of copolymers are copolymers of methyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid, copolymers of benzyl nethacrylate/methacrylic acid, copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic icid, copolymers of benzyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/styrene, copolymers of benzyl nethacrylate/methacrylic acid/hydroxyethyl methacrylate, copolymers of methyl nethacrylate/butyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/styrene, copolymers of methyl meth-icrylate/benzyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/hydroxyphenyl methacrylate.

Dther examples of component (a) are polymers or oligomers having at least two ethylenically jnsaturated groups and at least one carboxyl function within the molecule structure, such as J resin obtained by the reaction of a saturated or unsaturated polybasic acid anhydride with a )roduct of the reaction of an epoxy compound and an unsaturated monocarboxyiic acid (for jxample, EB9696 from UCB Chemicals; KAYARAD TCR1025 from Nippon Kayaku Co.LTD.; MK OLIGO EA-6340, EA-7440 from Shin-Nakamura Chemical Co.,Ltd.), or an addition jroduct formed between a carboxyl group-containing resin and an unsaturated compound laving an a,p-unsaturated double bond and an epoxy group (for ex., ACA200, ACA200M, \CA210P, ACA230AA, ACA250, ACA300, ACA320 from Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.).<br>
Examples of component (b) which are suitable in the compositions according to the invention ire photopolymerizable vinyl type monomers.   The representative examples are hydroxy-ilkyl acrylates such as 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, etc.; mono- or dla-irylates of glycols such as ethylene glycol, methoxytetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, )ropylene glycol, etc.; acrylamides such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, 5tc.; aminoalkyi acrylates such as N,N-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, etc.; polyvalent acrylates )f polyvalent alcohols such as hexanediol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipenta-’rythritol, and ethylene oxide or propylene oxide adducts thereof, tris-hydroxyethyl isocyanur-ite, etc.; phenoxy acrylate, bisphenol A diacrylate and acrylates of ethylene oxide or propy-ene oxide adducts of these phenols, etc.; acrylates of glycldyl ethers such as glycerin digly-:idyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, triglycidyl isocyanurate, etc.; and melamine icrylate, and/or methacrylates corresponding to the above acrylates, etc.<br><br>
A mono- or multi-functional ethylenically unsaturated compound, or mixtures of several of said compounds, can be included in the above composition up to 60% by weight based on the solid portion of the composition.<br>
The unsaturated compounds (b) can also be used as a mixture with non-photopolymerizable, film-forming components.

A photopolymerizable composition, comprising as further additive (d) a photosensitizer compound selected from the group consisting of benzophenone and its derivatives, thioxanthone and its derivatives, anthraquinone and its derivatives, or coumarin derivatives is preferred.<br>
The curing process can be assisted by adding photosensitizers, in particular, in compositions which are pigmented (for example with titanium dioxide), and also by adding a component which under thermal conditions forms free radicals, for example an azo compound such as 2,2'-azobls(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), a triazene, diazo sulfide, pentazadiene or a peroxy compound, for instance a hydroperoxide or peroxycarbonate, for example t-butyl hydroperoxide, as described for example in EP 245639.<br><br>
other examples of component d) are colorants like pigments or dyes, which are inert towards the other components of the photoresist formulations and does not interfere with the photo polymerization process.   Example of such pigments and dyes include but not limited to phthaiocyanines. Brilliant Green Dye, Malachite Green, fuchsine, auramine, Crystal Violet, Victoria Blue, substituted naphthalimide dyes, such as Calcofluor Yellow HEB, rhodamines and azosols.<br>
in addition, the photopolymerizabie mixtures may include various additives (d).   Examples of these are thermal inhibitors, which are intended to prevent premature polymerization, examples being hydroquinone, hydroquinone derivatives, p-methoxyphenoi, B-naphthol or stericaily hindered phenols, such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol   In order to increase the stability on storage in the dark it is possible, for example, to use copper compounds, such as copper naphthenate, stearate or octoate, phosphorus compounds, for example triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine, triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite or tribenzyl phosphite, quaternary ammonium compounds, for example tetramethylammonium chloride or trimethylbenzylammonium chloride, or hydroxylamine derivatives, for example N-diethylhydroxylamine.   To exclude atmospheric oxygen during the polymerization it is pos¬sible to add paraffin or similar wax-like substances which, being of inadequate solubility in the polymer, migrate to the surface in the beginning of polymerization and form a transparent surface layer which prevents the ingress of air.   It is also possible to apply an oxygen-imper¬meable layer on top of the coating, for example poly(vlnylalcohol-co-vinylacetate).   Light stabilizers which can be added in a small quantity are UV absorbers, for example those of the hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole, hydroxyphenyl-benzophenone, oxalamide or hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type.   These compounds can be used individually or in mixtures, with or without stericaily hindered amines (HALS). Examples of such UV absorbers and light stabilizers are<br>

Use<br>
Application areas of the dry film resist element using the photosensitive composition described in the present invention are for forming copper circuit pattern of printed circuit board and LSI packaging like etching resist and plating resist, for solder resist and for forming cell or electrode pattern in various flat display panel applications, e.g. forming barrier lib used in a plasma display panel by sand blast method.<br>
Examples Example 1<br>
Sample preparation<br>
A photocurable resist formulation for a dry film resist is prepared by mixing 100 parts by weight of ACA200M [solid content is 50% in weight] (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 20 parts by weight of dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate (Aldrich), 3.5 parts by weight of (4-mor-pholinobenzoyl)-1-benzyl-1-dimethylaminopropane (IRGACURE369 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and 50 parts by weight of acetone. To that mixture 0.6 parts by weight of 4,4'-[(9-Butyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)methylene]bis[N-methyl-N-phenylaniline] (Pergascript Blue S-RBP from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) is added and stirred.   All operations are carried out under yellow light.   The formulations are applied to PET film. The solvent is removed by heating at 80 C° for 10 minutes in a convection oven. The thickness of the dried resist layer is 33 [xm.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The color generation of the resist are monitored by the visible absorption at 620nm by using spectrophotometer U-3300 (Hitachi).   After the measuring absorbance, the resist surface is laminated with PET and heated at 130°C for 15minutes to mimic the heat lamination step of a dry film resist process.   Then the absorbance is measured after removing the PET film from the one side of the resist.   The resist is exposed at 300mJ/cm’ by using a metal halide lamp (ORG, model SMX 3000), and the absorbance is measured.<br><br>
Comparative Example:<br>
Sample preparation and evaluation are done in the same way as Example except 4,4'-[(9-Butyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)methylene]bis[N-methyl-N-phenylaniline] is replaced with 0.3 parts by weight of Leuco Crystal Violet (Aldrich).<br>

Example   2<br>
Sample preparation<br>
A photocurable resist formulation for a dry film resist is prepared by mixing 50 parts by weight of esterified styrene maleic-anhydrlde copolymer (Scrlpset 540 from Hercules), 50 parts by weight of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TCI), 5.0 parts by weight of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone (IRGACURE651 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), 130 parts by weight of acetone and 20 parts by weight of methanol. To that mixture 0.5 parts by weight of 4,4'-[(9-Butyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)methyiene]bis[N-methyl-N-phenylaniline] (Pergascript Blue S-RBP from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) is added and stirred.   All operations are carried out under yellow light.   The formulations are applied to PET film. The solvent is removed by heating at 60 C° for 10 minutes in a convection oven. The thickness of the dried resist layer is 38 |im.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The color generation of the resist is monitored by the visible absorption at 620nm by using spectrophotometer U-3300 (Hitachi).   The absorption is measured before and after the heat treatment at 10O'C for 5minutes to mimic the heat lamination step of a dry film resist process.   Then the resist is exposed at 50mJ/cm’ by using a metal halide lamp (ORC, model SMX 3000), and the absorbance is measured.<br>
