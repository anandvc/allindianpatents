				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 7-a-<br>
aminoacyl-cephalosporin of formula (I). More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a process for the preparation of {(6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-<br>
Aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)acetamido]-3-[(Z)	-2-(4-<br>
methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid} Cefditoren of the formula (I) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cefditoren has low toxicity to mammals but exhibits a very broad antibacterial spectrum against positive-bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Cefditoren is known to be a highly excellent therapeutic agent, which has been extensively utilized for the therapeutic treatments and preventive treatments of bacterial infections caused, by a variety of gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria.<br>
Originally Cefditoren was disclosed in US patent number 4,839,350. This patent also discloses various processes for the preparation of Cefditoren.<br>
US patent Nos. 5,616,703 and 6,235,897 discloses a process for the depletion of 7-amino-3-[(E)-2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid in Z/E mixtures of 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid a) by subjecting an amine salt<br><br>
of a Z/E mixture of 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid to crystallization and converting this amine salt into 7-amino-3-[2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, or b) by subjecting the Z/E mixture to chromatography.<br>
US patent 6,288,233 discloses a process for the preparation of Cefditoren by condensing Wittig salt of cipher moiety with thiazole-5-carbaldehyde in a mixture of chlorinated hydrocarbon and lower alkanol medium.<br>
Chem. Pharm.Bull. 39, (1991), 2433 discloses a process which involves conversion of GCLE (II) into Wittig salt, Wittig reaction with 5-formyl-4-methylthiazole, separation of isomer by fractional crystallization followed by column chromatography, deprotection to get free amine, reaction with protected MAEM followed by deprotection to get free acid (I). The E/Z isomer separation involves column chromatography hence yield is less.<br><br><br>
wherein PMP denotes p-methoxy phenyl<br>
The foregoing processes are associated with many problems such as poor yield and quality, difficult to commercialization, impurity and percentage of E isomer content is high. Hence there is a need to develop a process, which is easy to commercialize, and which yields good quality as well as quantity. We focused our research to find a process and finally achieved identifying a clean process for producing the title compound of the invention, which contains less percentage of E isomer.<br>
