				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a voltage-to-current transconductance stage<br>
arrangement comprising a single-ended input, an emitter-coupled pair of transistors<br>
comprising a first and a second transistor, whereby the emitter of a third transistor is<br>
connected to the collector of said first transistor, and a differential output. The<br>
invention also relates to a mixer and an amplifier comprising a transconductance<br>
stage arrangement.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
In many different kinds of circuits it is a requirement that the linearity is high.<br>
Examples of such arrangements or components are receivers and radio transmitters<br>
in wireless communication systems. Often the linearity of such arrangements is<br>
determined to a large extent, or mainly, by the linearity of amplifiers and mixers used<br>
in the system. Important for the linearity of such amplifiers or mixers, is the voltage-<br>
to-current transconductance stage which actually to a large extent constitutes the<br>
limiting factor as far as the linearity is concerned.<br>
Balanced circuits are often advantageous for several reasons compared to single-<br>
ended circuits. For example they are capable of cancelling the RF (Radio<br>
Frequency) signal at the output of a mixer used for frequency down-conversion. In<br>
order to be able to build a balanced circuit, often a single-ended input to differential<br>
output stage is needed. Such a stage can be provided in different ways. For<br>
instance, it is known to use a single-ended input to differential output passive balun<br>
(balanced-unbalanced circuit) before the transconductance stage. A passive balun<br>
consisting of inductors and capacitors however requires a large chip area and<br>
normally introduces losses, which is clearly disadvantageous.<br>
It is also known to use an active circuit acting as a balun and a transconductance<br>
stage simultaneously, comprising an emitter- coupled-pair (ECP). Such a single-to-<br>
differential emitter- coupled pair 1001 is shown in Fig. 1. A transconductance stage of<br>
 <br>
this kind can be made very compact and may also provide a gain in voltage-to-<br>
current conversion.<br>
In order to improve the linearity of the ECP transconductance stage, emitter<br>
degeneration techniques are often used. An example of such an arrangement 1002 is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2 wherein resistors Re1, Re2 are introduced at the emitter side of the<br>
respective transistors Q01, Q02-<br>
Linearity can also be enhanced by implementing the multi-tanh principle as<br>
described in "The multi-tanh principle: a tutorial overview", IEEE J. Solid-State<br>
Circuits, Vol. 33, no. 1, Jan. 1998 by Barrie Gilbert. Parallel connected sets of<br>
differential pairs (EPC) of transistors are then used. Such transconductance cells or<br>
stages are known as the multi-tanh principle based cells, the main idea being that<br>
the individually non-linear (hyperbolic tangent, tanh) transconductance functions<br>
may be separated along the input-voltage axis in order to achieve a more linear<br>
overall function. The simplest one is the so-called "doublet", but other, for example<br>
the "triplet" are also known.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a simplified implementation of a multi-tanh doublet 1003. In Fig. 3 a<br>
so-called multi-tanh doublet is shown which comprises two emitter-coupled pairs<br>
acting in parallel. The (physical) sizes of transistors Q01 and Q04 are typically several<br>
times different from the sizes of Q02 and Q03 which is the other emitter-coupled pair.<br>
However, even if the linearity can be increased, there will be a decrease of gain in<br>
transconductance compared with an EPC and, addition thereto, the actual linearity<br>
improvement is limited due to the fundamental weakness of the emitter-coupled pair.<br>
The reason that the linearity is limited for emitter-coupled pairs is that the<br>
incremental tranconductance gm of the transistors in the emitter-coupled pair<br>
decreases considerably with increasing input voltage applied across the bases of the<br>
transistors.<br>
Therefor mixers and amplifiers based on an ECP transconductance stage are often<br>
considered insufficient as far as the fulfillment of linearity requirements are<br>
concerned for many applications.<br>
 <br>
In "The micromixer: A highly linear variant of the Gilbert Mixer using a bisymmetric<br>
class-AB input stage", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 32, no. 9, Sept.<br>
1997, by Barrie Gilbert a solution to the problem referred to above is suggested. A<br>
simplified circuit diagram of the transconductance stage used in a so-called<br>
micromixer is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. The output currents l+ and I- for a<br>
given input signal Vin should be equal in amplitude and opposite in phase. The<br>
resistors R01, R02 and R03 are used to increase the input impedance since, the input<br>
impedance of Q02 and Q03 normally is quite low. However, even if the linearity can be<br>
improved as compared to ECP implementations, it is a problem with micromixer<br>
transconductances that the linearity deteriorates or goes down rapidly as the input<br>
RF power increases further. This is due to the fact that the DC component of a base-<br>
emitter voltage of Q02 and Q03, Vbe, decreases as the input RF power increases. This<br>
gives rise to gain compression and causes signal distortions. The reason for the<br>
decrease of Vbe can be explained as follow: When the input power increases, DC<br>
currents lDc through the emitters of Q02 and Q03 increase. Thus the DC voltage Vbe<br>
(Q02) + Vbe (Q03) = Vb- IDC (R03+ R02) decreases, Vb being the biasing voltage at the<br>
base of Q03. It has here been assumed that the DC currents lDc through Q02 and Q03<br>
are equal and the emitter resistors of the transistors are included in R02 and R03.<br>
Hence, there are today still no transconductances with a satisfactory linearity for<br>
several important applications, for example in wireless communication systems, but<br>
also for other applications.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore a voltage-to-current transconductance stage<br>
arrangement as initially referred to which has a good or high linearity. Particularly a<br>
transconductance stage with a function of single-input to differential-output balun is<br>
needed which is compact and which does not consume a large chip area and still is<br>
highly linear. Even more particularly an arrangement is needed which has a high<br>
linearity without there being any losses in transconductivity. Particularly a<br>
transconductance stage is needed which is not limited due to for example ECP<br>
 <br>
weakness as discussed above or particularly which is such that the linearity and the<br>
transconductivity can be kept also with an increased input voltage. Particularly a<br>
transconductance stage is needed which tolerates high input signals (high input<br>
voltages) and which have a large dynamical range. Most particularly<br>
transconductance stages are needed which are cheap and easy to fabricate and<br>
which are not complex. Most particularly transconductance stages are needed which<br>
can be used to provide amplifiers and mixers and other components with a high<br>
linearity. Particularly a transconductance stage is needed which can be used in<br>
components for wireless communication systems, even more particularly receivers<br>
and transmitters of a radio requiring a high linearity. Moreover amplifiers, mixers,<br>
particularly receivers and transmitters are needed which are highly linear.<br>
Therefore a voltage-to-current transconductance stage arrangement as initially<br>
referred to is provided which further comprises a common collector transistor<br>
comprising a fourth transistor connected to the base of said second transistor.<br>
Particularly the base of the fourth transistor is connected to the emitter of the third<br>
transistor (and the collector of the first transistor) and the emitter of the fourth<br>
transistor is connected to the base of the second transistor. In a particularly<br>
advantageous embodiment a fifth transistor is connected to the base of said third<br>
transistor. Preferably the sizes of said fourth or fourth and fifth transistor(s)<br>
respectively considerably exceed(s) the sizes of said second and third transistors.<br>
Particularly the emitter size of said fourth or fourth and fifth transistor respectively<br>
considerably exceed the emitter size of said second and third transistors. Particularly<br>
the emittor sizes of the fourth or fourth and fifth transistor respectively is about, or up<br>
to, N x the emitter size of the second and/or third transistor, wherein N is<br>
approximately 10.<br>
Even more particularly the emitter size of said fourth and/or fifth transistor<br>
respectively is more than N x the emitter size of said second and/or third transistor<br>
respectively, wherein N &gt; 10, e.g. up to about 20. (N may of course also be smaller<br>
than 10, but normally not smaller than 4-5.)<br>
 <br>
In a particular embodiment the collector current of said fourth or fourth and fifth<br>
transistors is/are the base biasing currents of said second and third transistors<br>
respectively. Even more particularly the fourth or fourth and fifth transistors is/are<br>
biased in an "off-state", so that the collector currents are extremely small.<br>
Particularly, for an increasing input power, the base-emitter voltage of said fourth a<br>
fourth and fifth transistors respectively is adapted to decrease rapidly, such that the<br>
corresponding DC-voltage components of the base-emitter voltages of said second<br>
and third transistors increase or do not change, hence providing a good linearity also<br>
at large RF input power.<br>
In one embodiment resistors or inductors are provided at or connected to the<br>
emitters of said first and/or second and third transistors in order to further increase<br>
the input impedance of said transistors. Even more advantageously said fourth or<br>
fourth and fifth transistors is/are arranged to increase the input impedance of said<br>
first and/or second and third transistors to the desired level such that no further or no<br>
resistors are needed to increase the input impedance of said first, second and third<br>
transistors.<br>
In one particular implementation a load inductor is arranged to load the collector of,<br>
particularly, the fourth transistor. A load inductor may also (or alternatively) be<br>
provided to load the collector of said fifth transistor, if included.<br>
In one implementation the base-collector (BC) junction capacitor and the load<br>
inductor (that optionally may be provided as discussed above) form a tunable series<br>
resonator. Particularly the input signal, i.e. the input voltage, has a frequency w0 and<br>
the tunable series resonator as discussed above is adapted to be tuned such that<br>
resonance will occur at twice the input frequency, i.e. at 2 x w0, such that the second<br>
harmonic of the input signal will be shorted to ground at the input, in order to further<br>
increase the linearity by reducing the third order intermodulation due to the<br>
interaction between the component of 2 x u&gt;0 and the fundamental one.<br>
 <br>
In particular implementations the transistors are bipolar transistors. More particularly<br>
the transconductance stage is implemented in SiGe or GaAs. It should be clear that<br>
also other materials can be used and it does not have to be bipolar transistors but<br>
FET or CMOS etc may also be possible. Particularly the arrangement comprises an<br>
integrated circuit (IC).<br>
Therefore, in order to solve the problems referred to earlier, a mixer comprising a<br>
transconductance stage as discussed above is also provided. An amplifier may also<br>
be provided comprising a transconductance stage in agreement with any one of the<br>
embodiments discussed above. Most particularly a transconductance stage as<br>
discussed above is used in one or more components in a wireless communication<br>
system in order to provide for a high linearity for example in receivers and<br>
transmitters. Also other implementations are of course possible.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 very schematically illustrates an emitter-coupled pair (ECP) arrangement 1001<br>
for an active circuit acting as a balun and a transconductance stage simultaneously<br>
with two emitter-coupled transistors Q01, Q02<br>
Fig. 2 schematically illustrates a similar ECP transconductance stage 1002 but with<br>
resistors Re1, Re2 connected to the respective emitters for emitter degeneration<br>
purposes, which is a known measure to increase the linearity of an arrangement as<br>
in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a known multi-tanh doublet 1Oo3. It also discloses another method for<br>
improving linearity. The sizes of Q01 and Q04 typically differ several times from the<br>
sizes of Q02 and Q03. However, all the emitter-coupled pairs are not satisfactory as<br>
far as linearity requirements are concerned for various applications, particularly due<br>
to the transconductance of the transistors decreasing considerably with an<br>
increasing input voltage applied across the bases of the transistors.<br>
Fig. 4 schematically shows a known so called micromixer 1O04 according to one<br>
implementation, or more specifically the transconductance stage used in a<br>
micromixer. The output currents l+ and I- for a given input signal Vin are equal in<br>
amplitude and opposite in phase. The resistors R01, R02, R03, as also discussed<br>
above, are used to increase the input impedance. The linearity, however, goes down<br>
rapidly as the input RF power increases due to the fact that the DC component of<br>
the base emitter voltage of Q02 and Q03, i.e. VBE decreases with an increasing input<br>
power. As discussed above when the input power increases, the DC currents<br>
 <br>
through the emitters of Q02 and Q03 increase and the DC voltage<br>
VBE (Q02) + VBE (Q03) = Vb- IDC (R03 + R02) decreases, Vb being the biasing voltage at<br>
the Q03 base.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an arrangement according to the present invention wherein the<br>
problems with among others decreased linearity or deteriorated linearity at<br>
increasing input of power are reduced or overcome. In Fig. 5 a single ended input-to<br>
differential output transconductance stage 1d is illustrated.<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention two common collector transistors Q4<br>
4, Q5 5 are provided or connected to the bases of Q2 and Q3 2, 3 substantially<br>
corresponding to Q02 and Q03 of Fig. 4. Particularly transistor Q4 4, but also<br>
transistor Q5 5 plays a very important role in improving the linearity of the<br>
transconductance stage. Actually, instead of decreasing, the DC component of the<br>
base emitter voltage of Q2 2 (Vbe) increases as the input power increases or keeps<br>
out of change, which is completely different from the arrangement shown in Fig. 4.<br>
As a result thereof, the transconductance stage is capable to tolerate larger input<br>
signals and its dynamic range will be extended to a large extend.<br>
According to the invention the size of Q4 4 and Q5 5 respectively considerably<br>
exceeds the size of Q2 2 and Q3 3. The size here means the physical size i.e. the<br>
emitter width multiplying the length. The ratio of the emitter sizes may for example<br>
be as large as 10:1. It should be clear that this of course merely is one example and<br>
the ratio can be smaller as well as considerably larger as well for example down to<br>
4:1 up to 20:1 or even more. This is to avoid that the AC voltage at input mainly is<br>
supplied to the base-emitter ports of Q4 4 and Q5 5. It should be noted that the AC<br>
voltage at input is split between the base-emitter port of Q2 2 and Q4 4, or Q3 3 and<br>
Q55.<br>
Advantageously Q4 4 and Q5 5 are biased, in an off state such that their quiescent<br>
collector current will be extremely small since these currents form the base bias<br>
currents of Q2 2 and Q3 3. According to the invention the base-emitter voltage of Q4<br>
and Q5 will decrease rapidly as the input power increases. This in turn will produce<br>
 <br>
an increase in the corresponding DC voltages of Q2 2 and Q3 3. Hence, with a circuit<br>
configuration according to the present invention, the linearity of the<br>
transconductance stage will be improved, particularly at large RF input powers.<br>
Moreover, the input impedance is increased by adding Q4 4 and Q5 5 hence<br>
reducing or even eliminating the need of resistors R01, R02, R03 as used in the<br>
Micromixer of Fig. 4 to boost the input impedance. In the embodiment of Fig. 5 such<br>
resistors are eliminated.<br>
In another embodiment (not shown) only transistor Q 4 is provided as in Fig. 5, i.e.<br>
transistor Q5 5 is not included. In every other aspect of such an embodiment, the<br>
features correspond to the once discussed with refrence to Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 6 shows another embodiment, similar to Fig. 5, with an arrangement 102 in<br>
which resistors R-1, R2, R3, R4 are provided in order to still further increase the input<br>
impedance though they need not have to be used as they do in the Micromixer<br>
shown in Fig. 4. This also applies to an embodiment as discussed above in which<br>
only transistor Q4 4 is provided. It should be noted that all or same of the resistors<br>
RTR4 can be replaced by inductors.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an arrangement 103 in which an inductor Li is used as a collector load<br>
to Q4. This inductor L1 and the base collector junction capacitance of Q4 4 will form a<br>
series resonator that can be tuned such that the resonance occurs at 2 x Wo,<br>
wherein Wo denotes the frequency of the input signal. This means that the second<br>
harmonic of the input signal will be shorted to ground at the input further increasing<br>
the linearity. Although transistor Q5 5 is shown in Fig. 7, it should be clear that the<br>
inclusion of transistor Q5 5 relates to a particularly advantageous embodiment, the<br>
main thing being that transistor Q4 4 is included.<br>
Particularly the transistors are implemented as bipolar transistors, in a most<br>
advantageous implementation. In an alternative implementation they are<br>
implemented as MOSFETs, or other MOS devices or similar. Most appropriate seem<br>
to be SiGe HBT and GaAs HBT implementations.<br>
<br>
 <br>
The implementation of an arrangement in IC design is straightforward and does not<br>
require any unusual measure or procedures. From the IC design point of view, the<br>
addition of transistor Q4 or the two transistors, Q4, Q5 and possible one or more<br>
inductors e.g. in order to load Q4 and/or Q5, will not add to the complexity of the<br>
circuit or affect it in any substantial way, except for improving linearity. The noise<br>
figure might increase slightly.<br>
It should be clear that although a part of the circuit consisting of transistors Q1, Q2 is<br>
in a form similar to a current mirror with a so called p helper Q4, it should also be<br>
clear that they play fundamentally different roles and Q4 according to present<br>
invention is an integrated part of the active transconductance stage. The input RF<br>
signal applies to Q4. In contrast, in the current mirror construction the corresponding<br>
counterpart to Q4 serves the purpose of DC biasing in order to stabilize the mirror<br>
current and it is entirely isolated from the input RF signal.<br>
It should be clear that the invention can be varied in a number of ways within the<br>
scope of the appended claims and it is in no way limited to the explicitly discussed<br>
and illustrated embodiments but different materials and different sizes can be used<br>
and additional loads such as inductors and resistors etc can be added in order to<br>
provide for specific properties although they are not necessary for the concept of the<br>
invention.<br>

<br>
The present invention relates to a voltage-to-current transconductance stage<br>
arrangement comprising a single-ended input, an emitter-coupled pair of transistors<br>
(1,2), comprising a first transistor (1) and a second transistor (2), the emitter of a<br>
third transistor (3), being connected to the collector of said first transistor (1), and<br>
differential output. It further comprises at least one common-collector transistor<br>
comprising a fourth transistor (4) connected to the base of said second transistor (2)<br>
preferably or optionally also and a fifth transistor (5) connected to the base of said<br>
third transistor (3). The size of said fourth (4), or fourth and fifth transistors (4,5)<br>
considerably exceed the sizes of said second and third transistors. They are biased<br>
at "off-state". An extra inductor at the collector of the transistor (4) may be applied to<br>
further increase linearity.</td>
