road conditions. The object of this invention is to test the wheel hub bearing validation in more realistic manner by applying separate axial and radial load rather than conventional resultant load setup.<br>
In the present biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig the wheel bearing experiences load at center of wheel. The radial load is applied at wheel center line and the axial load is being applied at tire contact patch by maintaining the distance of dynamic tire radius (DTR). This load is achieved by two actuators mounted on structure of the rig.<br>
The biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig basically comprises of two hydraulic actuators, one is axial actuator which is mounted on frame member and channel provided on load bracket for sliding arrangement , so that axial actuator can be moved vertically for adjusting dynamic tire radius (DTR) which varies for application to application. And another actuator is Radial actuator which is mounted vertically from top of frame. The wheel hub bearing assembly is connected to adaptor mounted on spindle at one end which in turn is supported by plummer block. Plummer block comprises of two bearings at both end. The one end of support spindle is coupled with shaft of motor which is mounted on the frame.<br>
In its working principle, the derived test conditions is feed into NI DAQ control panel , through this the input goes to variable frequency drive(VFD).Here variable frequency drive( VFD) works as intermittent unit which regulates the motor and maintains the constant speed and torque through out the test.<br>
The motor is coupled to one side of the shaft spindle, as there will be more load coming to the spindle while testing, to overcome with this problem the Plummer block is introduced which comprises of two heavily rated bearings in housing. These bearing carry the entire load coming to the spindle and stops load transferring to motor which prevents the motor failure.<br><br><br>
More sophisticated hydraulic power pack is used for the load application. There are proportional valves which are incorporated in this hydraulic power pack are being used for getting high frequency response and proper distribution of load to the actuators based on the data acquired during road load data (RLD).<br>

This invention is more related to biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig to simulate the load conditions on the rig, which the wheel assembly of the vehicle experiences at extreme cornering and on different profile of the road conditions.<br>
In the present test rig the wheel bearing experiences load at center of wheel. The radial load is applied at wheel center line and the axial load is being applied at tyre contact patch by maintaining the distance of dynamic tire radius (DTR). And this load is achieved by two actuators mounted on structure of the test rig.<br><br><br>
The new hub bearing test rig as shown in Figure 3 basically comprises of two Hydraulic actuators, one is axial actuator(l) which is mounted on frame member and channel provided on load bracket (19) (see Fig 6), so that axial actuator can be moved accordingly in vertical direction for adjusting dynamic tire radius (DTR) which varies for application to application. And another actuator is Radial actuator (2) which is mounted vertically from top of frame. The hub bearing assembly (3) is connected to adopter (5) mounted on spindle at one end which in turn is supported by Plummer block (4). Plummer block comprises of two bearings at both end. The one end of support spindle is coupled with shaft of motor (6) which is mounted on the frame (7) and other end is coupled with the adopter.<br>
In its working principle, the derived test conditions is feed into NI DAQ control panel , through this the input goes to variable frequency drive(VFD).Here variable frequency drive( VFD) works as intermittent unit which regulates the motor and maintains the constant speed and torque through out the test.<br>
The motor is coupled to one side of the shaft spindle, as there will be more load coming to the spindle while testing, to overcome with this problem the Plummer block is introduced which comprises of two heavily rated bearings in housing. These bearing carry the entire load coming to the spindle and stops load transferring to motor which prevents the motor failure.<br>
More sophisticated Hydraulic power pack is used for the load application. There are proportional valves which is incorporated in the this hydraulic power pack is being used for getting high frequency response and proper distribution of load to the actuators based on the data acquired during road load data(RLD).<br>
As a software part of it, NI DAQ software is used to acquire &amp; monitor critical test parameters like vibration level, test rpm, load, hydraulic pressure &amp;<br><br><br>
temperature etc will be monitored and acquired with the accuracy of 50 points per sec basis, along with the graph. NI DAQ hardware &amp; software part is very compact in comparison with Programmable logic control (PLC) unit used in the conventional hub bearing test rig. It helps to locate the initiation of any failure and examine failure initiation point. This data can be acquired and stored in the system and used further for analysis and on line report generation.<br>
Now referring to figure 5, which shows schematic arrangement of radial load actuator. In vehicle, under dynamic condition, the wheel bearing assembly experiences vertical loads from road through tyre contact path. This vertical load is applied by means of radial actuator.<br>
Radial actuator is provided for applying radial load to said wheel hub bearing assembly, said radial actuator is mounted from top of the frame by means of bracket (12) that holds the radial cylinder firmly with the help of support bracket (14) mounted on top of the bracket (12) which slides on sliding rail provided on said bracket to adjust the said radial actuator to wheel centre line.<br>
The radial actuator comprises of hub adopter (8). This hub adaptor is intended for holding and driving the test component. This is press fitted in to the spindle and tightened with the fasteners to avoid any slippage between the same. Tough material is used for making this adaptor taking into consideration that it should withstand high load, transferred to it during testing. Enough space is provided to adjust the eccentricity of the hub unit with respect to the axis of drive spindle. There are two brackets, by means of which the actuators are positioned. Bracket (12), which is a vertical member that holds the radial cylinder firmly by means of support bracket (14) and rear eye and klevis pin (13). The top end of the radial actuator is suspended by means of the rear eye and klevis pin. Klevis pin also facilitate the actuator to rotate in all degrees of freedom. The support bracket (14) is mounted on the top of the bracket which holds the klevis pin (13) and slides on sliding rail provided on bracket to adjust<br><br><br>
the actuator to wheel centre line. Once the adjustment of vertical actuator is done, the support bracket is locked to restrict the actuator movement . This is helpful to adjust the actuator to the wheel center line for application to application.<br>
Said radial actuator comprises load cell adopter (11) which transfers the accurate load coming from cylinder. It is made up of stiff material. Said load cell adopter acts as a connecting member for said radial actuator which also comprises radial load cell (10) wherein radial load cell has 8 ton force sensing capacity in both compression and tension mode. Other end of the said radial load cell is bridged by radial bracket (09). Said radial bracket acts as an intermediate member for the said load cell and the hub adopter holding unit. Said intermediate member is also made up of stiff material to transfer the accurate load coming from cylinder.<br>
Now referring to Figure 6, which shows the schematic arrangement of axial load actuator mounting, In vehicle, under dynamic condition, the wheel bearing assembly experiences cornering loads through tyre contact path. This cornering load is applied by means of the axial actuator .To simulate this condition, the combined load bracket (19) has been developed.<br>
Axial actuator for applying axial load on the wheel hub bearing assembly, said axial actuator is mounted on said frame by means of load bracket (19) that holds the axial cylinder firmly with the help of clevis pin (21), said load bracket having sliding arrangement which facilitates said axial actuator vertical movement to adjust the dynamic tire radius.<br>
Here axial actuator is adjusted according to dynamic tire radius (DTR) by the sliding arrangement provided on said bracket and locked. This bracket facilitates the axial actuator (1) to move an adequate amount in vertical direction that is required for adjusting various dynamic tire radius (DTR) for<br><br><br>
range of applications. The axial actuator is held by the unit called clevis pin (15, 21). Pin (15) is comparatively smaller in size and linked between the rear eye (16) and the rig structure, the said rear eye is used as a link to bridge the gap between the load cell (17) and clevis pin (15). Another clevis pin (21) is connected between the actuator to load bracket (19) so as to transfer the load impending from actuator to said load bracket. Load cell (17) has 4 ton force sensing capacity in both compression and tension mode. This load cell is joined to axial actuator by means of load cell adopter (18) which is made up of hard material and tapped from both side. Double acting cylinder is used as an axial actuator (1) for applying axial load, in this hydraulic pressure is applied to either port giving powered motion when extending and retracting. Double acting cylinder has identical areas on each side of the piston and they can provide equal forces in either direction with equal displacement.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig and method of testing thereof<br>
The present invention relates to biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig which comprises basically at least two hydraulic actuators, one is axial actuator for applying axial load to the wheel hub bearing assembly and another is radial actuator for applying radial load to the wheel hub bearing assembly.<br>
This test rig encompasses the endurance test requirements for "CORNERING FATIGUE TEST" for wheel hub bearings and hub bearing units of passenger cars, LCV's, HCV's,MCV's &amp; UV's subjected to actual Road load conditions being applied on test rig.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the load application in which radial load is applied exactly at the wheel centre line and axial load at the dynamic tire radius.<br>
With this test rig actual road load conditions like vertical, Left Cornering, Right Cornering loads which are experienced by the wheel can be applied to the wheel hub bearing assembly. This test rig has been developed to simulate the actual road load conditions with the help of axial and radial actuators.<br>
This new biaxial wheel hub bearing validation test rig is compact in construction with advanced features, ease of operation and cost effective. In accordance with this invention new method of testing the wheel hub bearing validation test rig has been developed.<br><br></td>
