Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an imaging apparatus.  In detail, the present invention relates to an imaging apparatus, in which the operability and visibility at the time of setting and adjusting functions of the imaging apparatus are improved.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, in an imaging apparatus, in association with the improvement of functions and performances, items to be set by a user are increased. For this reason, methods for easily setting a target function are variously devised.  Usually, a hierarchy type menu method is used for managing index information, in which setting items and adjusting items of the imaging apparatus are classified into hierarchy type predetermined categories, and this index information is displayed in stages, and then a target item is selected.<br>
In the hierarchy type menu method, at first, a list table of index information corresponding to classified categories is displayed as [Main Menu], and when desired index information is selected from this [Main Menu], there is further [Sub-Menu] in this [Main Menu], that is a menu on and after second rank of a hierarchy, and there is further a plurality of items in this [Sub-Menu].  In this way, each menu has a plurality of hierarchies.  Then, the staged selection of the items displayed in the menu<br><br>
enables a user to set a desired item or function. (For example, refer to Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. JP H9-305360 (pp. 3-4, Fig. 2).}<br>
However, the function setting method based on the conventional hierarchy type menu method and the like has a problem that the operability and visibility at the time of setting,, adjusting, and displaying the function of the apparatus are poor (which will be pointed out in 1) to 8) below),<br>
1)	In the conventional hierarchy type menu method,<br>
as the setting items are increased, the classified<br>
categories are also increased.  Consequently, the index<br>
information displayed on [Main Menu] and the hierarchy<br>
rank number of the [Sub-Menu] are increased.  Thus, the<br>
number of the steps until reaching a target setting<br>
screen image is increased, and accordingly, it becomes<br>
difficult; to search a necessary item or function.<br>
2)	Therefore, by selecting the setting items and<br>
adjustment items which are frequently used by a user, a<br>
customized [Personal Menu] can be provided so that the<br>
user is able to select items or functions to be<br>
frequently executed with the small number of the steps.<br>
However, it; is difficult to search, only with the<br>
[Personal Menu], a necessary item or function, such as<br>
when selecting another item or function that is not<br>
registered in the [Personal Menu], when adding a new item<br>
or function to the [Personal Menu], or in other cases.<br>
3} In order to select the item or function which belongs to index information different from the index information selected from the menu, a procedure including such as once moving to that menu screen image, again<br>
selecting the target index information, and then displaying the item or function belonging to that index information is required.<br>
4)	In a case where two buttons including a button<br>
to determine the change in the setting or to advance to a<br>
next screen image (hereafter, referred to as a [Execute]<br>
button) and a button to return to a screen image<br>
displayed before the setting screen image (hereafter,<br>
referred to as a [Return] button) are displayed on the<br>
setting screen image to set an item or function, there is<br>
a problem that it is difficult to understand only by<br>
viewing the screen image display, for example, such as a<br>
case where it is not known whether or not the operation<br>
of the setting change is executed; a case where after the<br>
setting change is determined, the setting can not be<br>
returned back to the original condition even if the<br>
[Return] button is operated; a case where it is not known<br>
which of the buttons can be operated; or a case where the<br>
result after the execution of the operation of the<br>
selected button is not obvious.<br>
5)	In the setting screen image that is displayed<br>
when a setting value is set, an available range for<br>
setting values is divided into constant intervals or<br>
intervals based on a logarithmic function such as decibel<br>
values so as to increase and decrease the setting value<br>
on the basis of the divided intervals, and character<br>
information, and graphic are used to carry out the screen<br>
image display.  However, the setting range includes a<br>
range to be fineLy set, a range to be roughly set and the<br>
like.  Its range is also different depending on each<br>
setting value, thus such a screen image display has a<br>
problem that it is intuitively unintelligible and the setting operation is difficult.<br>
6)	In association with the increase in the items<br>
and functions to be set, when they are displayed on the<br>
screen by using character information, icons, and the<br>
like, there is a problem that they can not be displayed<br>
on a single screen image, or an icon for a setting item<br>
which is unnecessary depending on the condition of the<br>
apparatus is displayed. Also, in a case where the<br>
display positions and display orders of the character<br>
information, the icons, and the like are defined, there<br>
are also similar problems.<br>
7)	In the conventional imaging apparatus, the<br>
execution of a certain operation A causes a screen image<br>
A based on the operation A to be transparently displayed<br>
on a screen image currently being displayed, and the<br>
further execution of another operation B ends the screen<br>
image A that is transparently displayed and causes a<br>
screen image B based the operation B to be transparently<br>
displayed on the screen image currently being displayed.<br>
However, this has a problem that the display condition on<br>
the screen image is greatly changed so that the user<br>
significantly feels uncomfortable and anxiety.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 29A, under a condition that an imaged screen image 900 currently being imaged is displayed on a display 120A, if an operation of [Setting of Exposure Correction] is executed, as shown in FIG. 29B, a GUI screen image for the [Setting of Exposure Correction] is transparently displayed on the imaged screen image 900.<br>
Moreover, under the condition of a screen image<br>
900A on which the GUI screen image for the [Setting of Exposure Correction] is transparently displayed, if the recording of image is triggered to be started, as shown in FIG. 29C, once the transparent display on the GUI screen image for the [Setting of Exposure Correction] is ended, a new message such as [Cassette Is Not Inserted] 13 transparently displayed on an imaged screen image 900B.<br>
As described above, the displaying condition on the screen which is greatly changed brings significant discomfort and there may occur a problem that the operation during which the screen image is changed is unknown.<br>
8) In a case where there are a plurality of folders in which a plurality of image data are classified and arranged in a recording medium to be set in the imaging apparatus and made into a single unit, under the condition that image data recorded in a certain folder is displayed, it is not possible to change the folder to another folder or to perform a setting such as an erasure prohibition setting and the like on the image data.  Thus, this has a problem that the operability to the recorded image data is not excellent.<br>
Thusir there is a problem that must be solved in providing an imaging apparatus, in which the operability and visibility at the time of setting the function of the imaging apparatus are improved.<br>

When the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select a [Personal Menu] from the icon or menu information displayed on the display 120, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in accordance with a control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125.<br>
The [Personal Menu] is the unique menu information generated by individually selecting setting item frequently used by a user among the setting items for setting the function of the imaging apparatus.<br>
When the [Personal Menu] is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates a GUI screen image 100 for the [Personal Menu] on the basis of unique menu information ([Personal Menu]) stored in the storing section (memories) and its image data to display the GUI screen image on the display 120 (ST100).<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the GUI screen image 100 is provided with a [Set Item] button group 10 for indicating a setting item that is individually selected among the setting items to set the function of the imaging apparatus, an [Alter] button 11 for altering the GUI screen image to display another [Set Item] button group 10' in a case where a plurality of setting items exist, a screen image number display section 13 for displaying [a screen image (page) number which is currently displayed]/ [entire screen image (page) number] in a case where a plurality of GUI screen images 100 exist, an [End] button 12 for terminating the GUI screen image 100, and the like. The [Set Item] button group 10 includes a [Menu Edit] button 15 to edit and operate the setting item of the [Personal Menu].<br>
Here, in a case where a desired setting item exists in the [Set Item] button group 10 displayed on the GUI screen image 100, the user selects/operates the corresponding [Set Item] button by operating the operating section 130 or touching the LCD panel (ST101).<br>
On the other hand, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select/operate the [Alter] button 11, the system microcomputer 140<br>
generates the GUI screen image 100 composed of another [Set Item] button group 10' stored in the storing section (memories), and then displays it on the display 120 (ST101-&gt;ST102-&gt;ST103-&gt;ST101).<br>
And, when the desired [Set Item] button is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 judges whether or not the selected button is the [Menu Edit] button 15 (ST101-&gt;ST104) .<br>
If the selected button is not the [Menu Edit] button 15, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 and displays the GUI screen image corresponding to the selected [Set Item] button on the display 120 so that the desired setting operation can be executed (ST104-&gt;ST105, ST106) .<br>
On the other hand, if the selected button is the [Menu Edit] button 15, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates a GUI screen image 100A to edit and operate the setting item for the [Personal Menu] to display it on the display 120 (ST104-&gt;ST107).<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 5, the GUI screen image 100A is provided with an edition button group 15A composed of an [Add] button for adding a new setting item to the [Personal Menu], a [Delete] button for deleting the setting item registered in the [Personal Menu], a [Rearrange] button for rearranging the displayed<br>
positions of the setting item buttons on the GUI screen image 100, and an [initialize] button for initializing the setting item, and an [End] button 12A for closing the GUI screen image 100A, and the like.<br>
And, operating the operating section 130 or touching the LCD panel to select a desired editing button from the edition button group 15A enables execution of the editing operation of the [Personal Menu] (ST107-&gt;ST108).<br>
In succession, operation at the time of executing the editing operation of the [Personal Menu] from the GUI screen image 100A of FIG. 5 will be explained in accordance with the following (A) to (D) .<br>

Then, in a case where the [Set Item] button that is desired to be deleted exists in the [Set Item] button group 10 displayed on the GUI screen image when the<br>
operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched, the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touchec to select the corresponding [Set Item] button (ST141).<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the [Set Item] button that is desired to be deleted does not exist in the [Set Item] button group 10, when the [Alter] button 11 is selected and operated, the system microcomputer 140 generates the GUI screen image 100 composed of another [Set Item] button group 10 stored in the storing section (memories) so as to display it on the display 120 (ST141-&gt;ST142-&gt;ST143-&gt;ST141) .<br>
When the [Set Item] button that is desired to be deleted is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to this control signal, and displays a confirmation message as to whether or not the deletion is executed on the display 120 (ST141-&gt;ST144).<br>
When the [Delete] operation is executed, the system microcomputer 140 reads out the unique menu information stored in the storing section (memories), and deletes the information (data) corresponding to the relevant [Set Item] button, and then writes the unique menu information, from which the relevant information (data) is deleted, to the storing section (memories) (ST144-&gt;ST145, ST146) .<br>
When the [Delete] operation is not executed, the process returns back to a predetermined GUI screen image and ends (ST144-&gt;End).<br>
(C) Operation for a case where the [Personal Menu]<br>
is [Initialized] will be explained with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 8.<br>
When, an [Initialize] button is selected from the edition button group 15A on the GUI screen image 100A of FIG. 5, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 to display a confirmation message as to whether or not the initialization of the [Personal Menu] is executed on the display 120 (ST16Q, ST161).<br>
In a case where the [Initialize] operation is executed, the system microcomputer 140 executes an initializing process such as writing (copying) default menu information to the storing section (memories), erasing the unique menu information, or the like (ST161-&gt;ST162).<br>
In a case where the [Initialize] process is not executed, the process returns back to the predetermined GUI screen image and ends (ST161-&gt;End).<br>
(D) Operation for a case where the [Set Item] buttons of the [Personal Menu] are [Rearranged] will be explained with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 9.<br>
When the [Rearrange] button is selected from the edition button group 15A on the GUI screen image 100A of FIG. 5, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 so as to display a GUI screen image 100B for rearranging the [Set Item] buttons for the [Personal Menu] as shown in FIG. IDA on<br>
the display 120 (ST180).<br>
And, in a case where a [Set Item] button that is desired to be moved exists in the [Set Item] button group displayed on the GUI screen image 100B by operating the operating section 130 or touching the LCD panel, the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select the relevant [Set Item] button (ST181) .<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the [Set Item] button that is desired to be moved does not exist in the [Set Item] button group 10, when the [Alter] button (refer to FIG. 4) is selected and operated, the system microcomputer 140 generates a GUI screen image 100B' composed of another [Set Item] button group 10' stored in the storing section (memories) to display it on the display 120 (ST181-&gt;ST182-&gt;ST183-&gt;ST181).<br>
And, when the [Set Item] button that is desired to be moved is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response* to this control signal and changes the display state of the target button, and also displays a GUI screen, image 100C to rearrange the [Set Item] buttons for the [Personal Menu] on the display 120 (ST181-&gt;ST184) .<br>
In this case, it is supposed that an [Item 3] button shown in FIG. 10B is selected.<br>
Next, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to designate a move position of the selected button on the GUI screen image 100C, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 so as to display a GUI screen image 100D in a<br>
condition that the button at the designated position is exchanged with the target button on the display 120 (ST185, ST186).<br>
Here, when a position of an [Item 4] button is designated, as shown in FIG. 1OC, the GUI screen image 100D in which the displayed positions of the target [Item 3] button and [Item 4] button that are exchanged is displayed on the display 120.<br>
Next, it is selected whether or not the moving operation is to be continued (ST187).<br>
Here, in a case where the moving operation is to be continued, the |Set Item] button that is desired to be moved is again set on the GUI screen image 100D, and the above-mentioned operations are repeated (ST187-&gt;ST181-&gt;•••).<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 10D, in a case where the [Item 3] button is to be successively moved, when the [Item 3] that is the target button is selected and a position of an [Item 5] button is designated as a move destination position, a GUI screen image 100E in which the displayed positions of the [Item 3] and [Item 5] buttons are exchanged is displayed on the display 120.<br>
And, when the move of the button is ended, namely, when the position of the [Set Item] button is fixed, an [OK] button 13c on the GUI screen image is operated (ST187-XST188) .<br>
The operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140 when the [OK] button 13c is operated, and the system microcomputer 140 stores position information of the [Set Item] button group 10 in the<br>
current GUI screen image in the storing section (memories) in response to this control signal (ST189).<br>
Then, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 to display a GUI screen image 100' of the [Personal Menu], in which the [Set Item] button group 10 is newly rearranged on the display 120 as shown in FIG. 10E.<br>

When the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select the [Personal Menu] from the icon or menu information displayed on the display 120, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The [Personal Menu] is the unique menu information which the user generates by individually selecting frequently used setting items among the setting items for setting the function of the imaging apparatus.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 judges whether or not the [Personal Menu] is selected on the basis of the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 (ST200).<br>
In a case where the [Personal Menu] is not selected, the process and operation which are related to the [Personal Menu] are not carried out, and the process ends (ST200-&gt;End).<br>
In a case where the [Personal Menu] is selected,<br>
the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates the GUI screen image 100 (refer to FIG. 4) for the [Personal Menu], in accordance with the unique menu information stored in the storing section (memories) and its image data, to display it on the display 120 (ST200-&gt;ST201).<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 12 (a), the [Set Item] button group 10 on the GUI screen image 100 is provided with [Set Item] buttons such as [Bright Adjust], [Image Size Adjust], [AUDIOVAL], [Language Set], [White Balance] and the like, as well as a [Main Menu] button lOx to call for [Main Menu] which is default-displayed when the power switch 170 of the imaging apparatus is turned on, and the like.<br>
When the GUI screen image 100 is displayed, the system microcomputer 140 goes into a state to detect whether or not the operation of the [Set Item] button is carried out (ST202).<br>
And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select a button on the GUI screen image 100, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140 (ST202-&gt;ST203).<br>
Upon detecting the predetermined control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, the system microcomputer 140 judges whether or not the [Main Menu] button lOx is operated (ST204).<br>
In a case where the [Main Menu] button lOx is not operated, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image<br>
display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 to display the GUI screen image corresponding to the selected [Set Item] button on the display 120 (ST204-XST205).<br>
For example, if the [White Balance] button is selected in FIG. 12 (a), the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 12b, and generates a GUI screen image 2Ola for setting [White Balance] as shown in FIG. 12 (e) to display it on the display 120 (ST205-&gt;ST209) .<br>
And, the user operates the operating section 130 or touches the LCD panel to execute the setting operation, in accordance with the GUI screen image 2Ola displayed on the display 120 (ST210) .<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the [Main Menu] button lOx is operated, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates a GUI screen image 200 of the [Main Menu] to display it on the display 120 (ST204-&gt;ST206).<br>
On the GUI screen image 200, a list of the index information in which all of the setting items of the imaging apparatus are classified with a major division is displayed, for example, as shown in FIG. 12 (b) .<br>
Then, the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched in order to select the index information including desired setting item among the index information displayed on the GUI screen image 200<br>
 (ST207).<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates the GUI screen image for selecting the setting item corresponding to the selected index information to display it. on the display 120 (ST208) .<br>
For example, when the index information for [Camera Setting] on the GUI screen image 200 shown in FIG. 12(b) is selected, a GUI screen image 201 composed of [Set Item] buttons such as settable items [White Balance], [Gain], [Sharpness] and the like is displayed as shown in FIG. 12(c) , When the index information of [Time Setting] is selected, a GUI screen image 202 including [Set Item] buttons such as setting items [Standard Time Setting], [Area Setting] and the like is displayed as shown in FIG. 12(d).<br>
And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select the desired [Set Item] button on this GUI screen image 201 or 202, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140 (ST208) .<br>
Here, the [White Balance] button on the GUI screen image 201 shown in FIG. 12(c) is selected.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates a GUI screen image 201a for setting the selected [white Balance] to display it on the display 120 (ST209).<br>
The laser operates the operating section 130 or<br>
touches the LCD panel in accordance with the GUI screen image 201a displayed on the display 120, and executes the setting operation of the [White Balance] (ST210).<br>
Furthermore, when the [End] button is operated on each GUI screen image, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to a control signal f:rom the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and closes the display on the GUI screen image 100 for the [Personal Menu] (ST204-&gt;ST205-&gt;ST211-&gt;End).<br>
In this way, the [Main Menu] button lOx is configured to be included in the [Set Item] button group 10 on the GUI screen image 100 for the [Personal Menu]. Thus, it is possible to immediately shift from the GUI screen image for the [Personal Menu] to the GUI screen image for the [Main Menu] .<br>
[3]: Scroll-Display of Menu Item<br>

And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Move] button 21 on the GUI screen image 200, the index information displayed on the index display section 20 is scrolled to change the displayed condition of the index information currently being selected (ST301-&gt;ST302-&gt;ST300).<br>
When the [End] button 22 is operated, the process returns back to the screen image before the [Index Displaying] selection (ST301-&gt;End).<br>
On the other hand, for example, as shown in FIG. 14A, when index information [Item 3] is selected by operating the [OK] button 23, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image<br>
display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and generates a GUI screen image 300 for the selection and operation of the? setting item, on the basis of the information of the setting item corresponding to the index information [Item 3], to display it on the display 120 (ST301-&gt;ST303) .<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 14B, the GUI screen image 300 is provided with a setting item display section 30 for displaying a list of the setting items, a [Move] button 3.1 for scrolling and selecting the setting item displayed on the setting item display section 30, an [End] button 32 for closing the GUI screen image 300, an [OK] button 33 for determining the selection of the setting item, a symbol display section 34 for displaying the symbol 20a corresponding to the index information, a [Return] button 35 for returning to the GUI screen image 200 (the [Main Menu] screen image), and the like.<br>
The setting item display section 30 displays the setting item corresponding to the adjacent index information in the index display section 20 (refer to FIG. 14A) on the GUI screen image 300 on the basis of the number of the setting items to be displayed, and a boundary line L indicating its boundary.<br>
In FIG. 14B, on the setting item display section 30, setting items [cl] to [c4] corresponding to the index information [Item 3] are displayed, and a setting item [b5] corresponding to index information [Item 2] adjacent on the GUI screen image 200 is displayed, and the boundary line L is displayed on the boundary section between the setting item [cl] and the setting item [b5].<br>
And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Move] button 31 on the GUI screen image 300, the setting item displayed on the setting item display section 30 is scrolled to change the displayed condition of the setting item currently being selected (ST303-&gt;ST304-&gt;ST305-&gt;ST303).<br>
When the [Move] button 31 is operated beyond the boundary line L, the setting item of the adjacent index information is seamlessly displayed.<br>
For example, when the move button 31 is operated to scroll the setting item, the setting item display section 30 is changed to the displaying condition of FIG. 15B from that of FIG. 15A, and the setting item [cl] corresponding to the index information [Item 3] and the setting items [b2] to [b5] corresponding to the index information [Item 2] are displayed. A symbol [b] of the index information [Item 2] is displayed on the symbol display section 34.<br>
In this way, the boundary line L is displayed on the boundary between the adjacent index information on the GUI screen image 300, and the setting items are seamlessly displayed.  Thus, even if it does not return back to the GUI screen image 200 on which the list of the index information is displayed, all of the setting items can be confirmed and set. That is, the setting items corresponding to the respective index information are all placed in the continuously listing manner, and they can be continuously displayed.<br>
In this case, when the [OK] button 33 is operated on the GUI screen image 300, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control<br>
signal to the system microcomputer 140 (ST303~&gt;ST304-&gt;ST306) ,<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and displays the setting screen image corresponding to the setting item, in which the displayed condition in the setting item display section 30 is changed, on the display 120 (ST306-&gt;ST307).<br>
The user operates the operating section 130, or touches the LCD panel to execute the setting operation in accordance with the setting screen image (refer to FIG. 12 (e)) displayed on the display 120 (ST308).<br>
On the other hand, when the [Return] button 35 is operated on the GUI screen image 300, the screen image returns back to the GUI screen image 200 in the condition that the index information [Item 2] is selected (ST303-&gt;ST304-&gt;ST300).<br>
It is noted that, as shown in FIG. 16 (a), in a state where- the index information [Item 3] is selected on the GUI screen image 200 to shift to the GUI screen image 300, and the setting item is scrolled to go beyond the boundary line L on the GUI screen image 300, that is, for examples, a state where the setting item corresponding to the index information [Item 2] on the GUI screen image 200 is displayed, when the [Return] button 35 is operated, the screen image returns back to the GUI screen image 200 in the condition that the index information [Item 2] is selected as shown in FIG. 16(b).<br>
In addition, when the [End] button 32 is operated on the GUI screen image 300, the screen image returns<br>
back to the screen image condition before selecting the [Main Menu] (ST303-&gt;ST304-&gt;End).<br>
[4]: GUI Display of Selection/Determination of Operation<br>
Next, the GUI screen image at the time of selecting or determining the function of the apparatus will be described with reference to FIG. 17A to FIG. 17C.<br>
On the GUI screen image on which the menu information is displayed, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select the [Set Item] button, a predetermined control signal is sent from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and displays a function setting screen image, a GUI screen image 400, corresponding to the [Set Item] button on the display 120.<br>
For example, the GUI screen image 400 displays a GUI screen image composed of a setting button group 40 for setting functions A to C, and a [Return] button 41 for returning back to the previous displayed screen image before the GUI screen image 400, as shown in FIG. 17A.<br>
At this time, the setting button of the currently set function, for example, [Function B] is displayed in a condition different from the other setting buttons, and the fact that it is set is clearly indicated.<br>
In a case where the current setting may be maintained on the GUI screen image 400, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is<br>
touched to select the [Return] button 41, a predetermined control signal is sent from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 to the system microcomputer 140. The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and displays the displayed screen image before the GUI screen image 400 on the display 120.<br>
On the other hand, when the setting is changed to another function, the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select another setting button such as the setting button for the [Function C] of FIG. 17A, for example, among the setting button group 40.<br>
When the setting button of the [Function C] is selected, a predetermined control signal is sent from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 to the system microcomputer 140.  The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and changes the displayed condition of the setting button of the [Function C] to clearly indicate that it is selected, as in the GUI screen image 400a shown in FIG. 17B, and also changes the GUI display image of the [Return] button 41 to the GUI display image of a [Determine] button 42.<br>
The [Determine] button 42 on a GUI screen image 400a is displayed only in a case where the current setting is changed. It is designed such that unless the setting of the changed function is [Determined], it is not possible to shift to a screen image other than the GUI screen image 400a.  For this reason, the fact that<br>
the setting is changed can be obviously judged.<br>
When the [Determine] button 42 is operated, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 changes the function currently set, in accordance with the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and stores it in the storing section (memories).<br>
In a case where another setting button is erroneously operated or where the setting change is stopped, the setting button of the [Function B] before the change is selected on a GUI screen image 400b.<br>
When the setting button of the [Function B] is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and changes the displayed condition of the setting button of the [Function B] as shown on the GUI screen image 400b of FIG. 17C to clearly indicate the fact that it is selected.<br>
When the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Determine] button 42 on the GUI screen image 400b, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140, and the system microcomputer 140 maintains the setting stored in the storing section (memories) to be the condition before changing where the [Function B] is set, in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the<br><br>
GUI section 125, controls the image display device 150, and then closes the GUI screen image 400b.<br>
Alternatively, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Determine) button 42 on the GUI screen image 400b, the state shown in FIG. 17A, namely, the GUI screen image 400 is displayed.  By selecting the [Return] button 41 on the GUI screen image 400, the GUI screen image 400 may be closed.<br>
In this way, while the operation is not performed on the GUI screen image, the [Return] button is displayed, and when the operation has been carried out, it is switched to the [Determine] button to determine its operation.  Thus, it can be made clear whether or not the operation is performed on the GUI screen image currently being displayed.<br>
It is obvious that the buttons displayed on the GUI screen image are not limited to the [Return] button and the [Determine] button.<br>
[5]: Setting Screen of Numeric Data<br>
The GUI screen image at the time of setting numeric data will be described below with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 18. Here, the setting screen image in a case of setting a time interval of an intermittent recording is explained as an example.<br>
At first, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select a desired setting item from the icon and menu information displayed on the display 120, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the<br>
system microcomputer 140.<br>
Here, a setting item button of [Wait Time] for setting the time interval of intermittent recording is selected, and a predetermined control signal corresponding to the setting item button of this [Wait Time] is sent to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, reads out the setting information and screen image data of the currently set [Wait Time] from the storing section, and generates a GUI screen image 500, which is the setting screen image for setting the [Wait Time] to display it on the display 120 (ST500) .<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 19, a GUI screen image 500 for [Wait Time Setting] is composed of a setting range display section 50 for graphically displaying a range of setting values and a current setting value, a setting value display section 51 for character-displaying the setting value based on the graphic display of the setting range display section 50, operation buttons 52 (a [.-] button and a [ + ] button) for changing (increase or decrease) the setting value, an [OK] button 53 for determining the setting value, and the like.<br>
It is noted that the graphic information graphically displayed on the setting range display section 50 is stored in the storing section (memories) of the system microcomputer 140 as data which is obtained by preliminarily dividing the values of the settable range into a plurality of ranges so as to be set easily,<br><br>
defining as the predetermined set time interval based on the divided respective ranges, and changing a shape of graphic in accordance with the divided and set respective time intervals.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 19, the setting value of the wait time can be set in the range between 1 and 120 on the GUI screen image 500. The setting interval from 1 to 10 is assumed to be [1], the setting interval from 10 to 60 is assumed to be [10], and the setting interval of from 60 to 120 is assumed to be [60].  The width of a bar-shaped graphic is changed on the basis of each setting interval that is divided and set in this way.<br>
And, when the GUI screen image 500 is displayed on the display 120, the process comes into a standby state for detecting a button operation (ST510).<br>
Here, in a case of changing the setting value, when the operating section 130 is selected or the LCD panel is touched to operate the operation button 52 and the [OK] button 53, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a control signal corresponding to the operated button to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
On detection of the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, the system microcomputer 140 judges which button was operated (ST520) .<br>
In a case where the [-] button is operated, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 to change the display condition of the [-] button so as to clearly indicate that the [-] button was operated, and also carries out a process for subtracting a value corresponding to the graphic displaying on the<br><br>
setting range display section 50, namely, a predetermined value corresponding to a preset setting interval, in accordance with the number of the operations of the [-] button, from the current setting value stored in the storing section (memories) (ST520-&gt;ST521, ST522).<br>
Then, on the basis of the setting value obtained through the subtracting process, the display of the graphic information graphically displayed on the setting range display section 50 and the character information of the setting value display section 51 are updated (ST522-&gt;ST540).<br>
In a case where not the [-] button but the [+] button is operated, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 to change the display condition of the [+] button to clearly indicate that the [+} button was operated, and also carries out a process for adding a value corresponding to the graphic display on the setting range display section 50, namely, a predetermined value corresponding to the preset setting interval, in accordance with the number of the operations of the [+] button, to the current setting value stored in the storing section (memories) (ST520-&gt;ST530-&gt;ST531, ST532) .<br>
Then, on the basis of the setting value obtained through the adding process, the displaying of the graphic information graphically displayed on the setting range display section 50 and the character information of the setting value display section 51 are updated (ST532-&gt;ST540) .<br>
In a case where neither the [-] button nor the [+] button are operated but the [OK] button 53 is, the<br><br>
setting value currently being displayed on the GUI screen image 500 is stored in the storing section (memories) (ST520-&gt;ST530-&gt;ST550-&gt;ST560).<br>
As described above, by diving the setting range of the setting values into the plurality of ranges, setting the setting intervals corresponding to the divided respective ranges and then changing the shape of the graphic to be displayed on the basis of this setting interval, the range of the setting values corresponding to the respective setting items can be viewed efficiently and intuitively,<br>
[6]: Layout, Display of Icon and Character Information<br>
Operation at the time of displaying the graphic information of the apparatus condition (the setting state or the like) on the screen by the icon, the character information or the like will be described below with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 20.<br>
For example, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to carry out the operation for displaying a certain apparatus condition (a setting state or the like) from the icon or menu information displayed on the display 120, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 confirms the apparatus condition (the setting state or the like) in accordance with the order (priority) defined in a table data in the storing section (memories) upon receiving this control signal (ST600).<br>
Then, the system microcomputer 140 determines<br><br>
whether or not the graphic information corresponding to the confirmed apparatus condition should be displayed on the screen (ST601).<br>
In a case where there is no graphic information to be displayed, the process is ended (ST601-&gt;End).<br>
In a case where there is the graphic information to be displayed, it is judged whether or not this graphic information should be displayed (ST601-&gt;ST602) .<br>
In a case where the graphic information is not to be displayed, a process for judging whether or not the apparatus condition to be confirmed next is the graphic information to be displayed is performed (ST602-&gt;ST601).<br>
In a case where the graphic information is to be displayed, it, is judged whether or not the graphic information can be inputted to a buffer of the image display device 150 (ST602-&gt;ST603).<br>
In a case where the graphic information can be inputted to the buffer, the graphic information is read out from the storing section (memories) of the system memory 140, and the read out graphic information is inputted to the buffer of the image display device 150 (ST603-&gt;ST604).<br>
Then, when the graphic information is inputted to the buffer of the image display device 150, in accordance with the order (priority) defined in the table data, a similar judging process is repeated for the apparatus condition to be confirmed next (ST604-&gt;ST601-&gt;-••)•<br>
In a case where the graphic information can not be inputted to the buffer of the image display device 150, it is judged whether or not it can be inputted to a different buffer (ST603-&gt;ST605).<br><br>
In a case where the graphic information can be inputted to the different buffer, it is read out from the storing section (memories) of the system memory 140, and the read out graphic information is inputted to the different buffer of the image display device 150 (ST605-&gt;ST606-&gt;ST604) .<br>
When the graphic information is inputted to the different buffer of the image display device 150, in accordance with the order (priority) defined in the table data, a similar judging process is repeated for the apparatus condition to be confirmed next (ST604-&gt;ST601-<br>
&gt;•••).<br>
On the other hand, in a case of the condition that the graphic information cannot be inputted to the different; buffer, or the condition that there is no graphic information to be displayed, the system microcomputer 140 terminates the inputting process to the buffer (ST605-&gt;ST607, or ST601-&gt;ST607).<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150, and displays the graphic information on the display 120 in the order inputted to the buffer in accordance with the predetermined display information (position information, layout information (straight or curved layout, and the like), layout interval information, and the like) for displaying the graphic information) (ST607-&gt;ST608).<br>
For example, in a case where there are icons [A] to [Z] indicating the setting conditions, when the item for displaying a certain setting condition of the apparatus is selected, the system microcomputer 140 sequentially confirms the setting conditions of the respective<br><br>
corresponding sections within the apparatus, in accordance with the order (priority) defined in the table data of the storing section (memories), and judges whether or not the respective corresponding icons are displayed.<br>
And, the system microcomputer 140 sequentially inputs the graphic information of the icons to be displayed to the? buffer of the image display device 150, and when a predetermined setting condition is confirmed, the system microcomputer 140 displays the graphic information within the buffer on the display 120 in accordance with predetermined position information and layout information.<br>
For example, as shown on a setting display screen image 600 of FIG. 21A, the icons are lined up and displayed on the lower portion of the screen image, in the order of [A], [B], [E], [F], [G] , [C], [H] and [J]. In addition, in a case where they can not be displayed in a single line, as shown in FIG. 21B, remaining icons are lined up and displayed at a higher position.<br>
In a case of the conventional screen image display, the icons are displayed on the bottom portion of the screen image not in the order based on the apparatus condition and unnecessary icons are displayed, because the order is defined as [A], [B] , [C], [D], [E], [F], [G] and [H] . However, in a case of the screen image display as described above, even in a case where there are a large number of icons and character information and the like, the icons and character information which are required in accordance with the apparatus condition are displayed on the display in a predetermined layout.<br><br>
 [7]: Overlap Display<br>
Next, operation at the time of displaying a different GUI screen image on the display on which the screen image display is performed will be described with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 22.<br>
For example, under the condition that an image currently being imaged is displayed on the display 120, the system microcomputer 140 is in a condition of detecting whether or not the operating section 130 or the LCD panel is operated, namely, in a standby condition of waiting for the detection of the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125.<br>
When the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to carry out a predetermined operation in such a condition, the predetermined control signal is sent from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 to the system microcomputer 140 (ST700).<br>
The system microcomputer 140 judges whether or not the operation and display process in accordance with this control signal are possible upon receiving the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 (ST70Q-&gt;ST701).<br>
In a case where the operation and the display process can be performed, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150, generates a layer screen image, such as an operation screen image for executing the predetermined operation or a message screen image for carrying out the display of the message and the like, to overlap-display this layer screen image on the forefront of the screen image currently being displayed<br><br>
on the display 120 (ST701-&gt;ST702-&gt;ST704).<br>
It is noted that, by changing the brightness and coloration of the layer screen image or the screen image to be overlapped, the layer screen image that is overlap-displayed on the forefront is made visually striking.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the operation and the display process can not be performed, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150, carries out a display process for an error message, generates the layer screen image serving as a predetermined message screen image to overlap-display this layer screen image on the forefront of the screen image currently being displayed on the display 120 (ST701~&gt;ST703-&gt;ST704).<br>
The operations as described above are executed each time the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched, and the layer screen image is overlap-displayed on the forefront of the screen image displayed on the display.<br>
The specific example of the above-described GUI screen image will be described below.<br>
For example, in a case where the image taking is started in the imaging apparatus 1, the system microcomputer 140 actuates the imaging apparatus I at the operation mode, for example, such as the operation mode to record on a video cassette (hereafter, referred to as a cassette) through the power switch 170 when the power switch 170 is used to turn on a desired operation mode.<br>
When the imaging apparatus 1 is started in a desired operation mode as shown in FIG. 23A, an image signal obtained by the imaging section 110 is sent<br><br>
through the system microcomputer 140 to the image display device 150,, and the image display device 150 displays this image signal as an imaging screen image 700 on the display 120.<br>
Here, in a case where the exposure correction for the imaging screen image 700 displayed on the display 120 is carried out, for example, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to execute the operation of [Setting of Exposure Correction], the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150, generates the GUI screen image to set an exposure value shown in FIG. 23B as a layer screen image 710, and then overlap-displays on the front surface of the imaging screen image 700 of FIG. 23A.<br>
And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [+] button or the [-] button on the layer screen image 710, namely, on the GUI screen image of the [Setting of Exposure Correction], it can be set so as to obtain a desired exposure value.<br>
Additionally, under the condition that the layer screen image 710 of FIG. 23B is overlap-displayed, when the recording of the image is tried to be started, the system microcomputer 140 executes a message display process, controls the image display device 150, generates a layer screen image 720 to display a message such as [Cassette is Not Inserted] as shown in FIG. 23C if the cassette is not inserted into the apparatus, and then overlap-displays on the front surface of the layer screen image 710 displayed on the display 120.<br>
And, if a cassette is set or a predetermined time elapses, the overlap-display of the layer screen image<br><br>
720 overlap-displayed on the layer screen image 710 is closed, and it returns back to the condition of FIG. 23B.<br>
In this way, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select the operation, the system microcomputer 140 generates the layer screen image (the GUI screen image) corresponding to the selected operation and overlap-displays it on the forefront: of the display 120.<br>
In addition, for example, as shown in FIG. 24A, a display screen image 730 on which icons [A], [B] and [C] representing predetermined functions are displayed is displayed on the display 120. A case where a function of one among them, for example, the icon [B], is temporarily invalidated is explained.<br>
At first, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to [Invalidate] the function of the icon [B], the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in accordance with this operation, and generates an icon 75 indicating failure of the displayed icon [B] to overlap-display the icon 75 on the icon [B] as shown in FIG. 24B.<br>
And, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to [Validate] the function of the icon [B], the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in accordance with this operation, erases the overlap displaying of the icon 75 to return to the state of FIG. 24A.<br>
In this way, the overlap-display can be performed even on the graphic information such as the icon, the character information and the like. Similarly to the above-described case, as for the icons and the character<br><br>
information, the displaying condition can be variously arranged by combining and changing the color, the brightness, the shape and the like.<br>
For example, in a case of recording character information (a title and the like) on the lead of the image to be recorded or the like, it is possible that the character information is inputted and overlap-displayed, where the character information is conspicuously displayed in a preparing stage until the recording is started, and the character information after recording is started is made unnoticeable by changing the color, the brightness, the shape and the like.<br>
[8]: Folder Selection<br>
Next, operation at the time of selecting a folder of a recording apparatus or a recording medium will be described with reference to a flowchart of FIG. 25.<br>
At first, in order to select a folder recorded in the recording apparatus 160 or the sub-recording apparatus 165 and the recording medium, the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select a predetermined icon or menu information displayed on the display 120.<br>
When the predetermined icon or menu information is selected, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 obtains image data information of a current folder of the recording apparatus 160 or the sub-recording apparatus 165 in response to the control signal from the operating section<br><br>
130 or the GUI section 125 (ST800) .<br>
It is noted that a folder denotes a predetermined recording area {a storage space) in a recording apparatus or a recording medium for classifying, arranging, unifying and managing a plurality of image data, and a current folder denotes a folder that can be accessed.<br>
And, when obtaining the image data information of the current, folder, the system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150, generates index image information of the image data recorded in the current folder of the recording apparatus 160 or the sub-recording apparatus 165, and displays a GUI screen image 800 based on the generated index image information on the display 120 (ST801) .<br>
It is noted that index image information is information in which reduced image data of respective recorded image data can be generated and list-displayed.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 26, the GUI screen image 800 is provided with an image display section 80 for displaying index image information, a [Select] button 81 for selecting desired image data, an [End] button 82 for closing the GUI screen image 800, and a [Set] button 83 for calling out [Set Screen] for performing a setting operation on the selected image data.<br>
When the GUI screen image 800 is displayed, it becomes in a state of detecting a button to be operated (ST802) .<br>
Here, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the selection button 81, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system<br><br>
microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, sequentially changes the displayed condition of the reduced image data displayed on the image display section 80, and clearly indicates the selected image data (ST802-&gt;ST803-&gt;ST801-&gt;ST802).<br>
On the other hand, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to select and operate the [Set] button 83, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, generates a GUI screen image 810 of the [Set Screen] to perform the setting operation on the image data to overlap-display it on the GUI screen image 800 displayed on the display 120 (ST802-&gt;ST804).<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 27, the GUI screen image 810 is composed of a [Select] button 81a for selecting a desired button from a setting operation button group 85, an [End] button 82a for closing the [Set Screen] , and the setting operation button group 85 for performing the setting operation on the image data.<br>
The setting operation button group 85 is composed of, for example, a [Protect] button for prohibiting erasure of the selected image data, an [Erase] button for erasing the selected image data, a [Print Mark] button for setting a print mark for the selected image data, a<br><br>
 [Folder Select] button for moving to a different folder, and the like.<br>
When the GUI screen image 810 is displayed, it becomes in a state for detecting a button to be operated (ST804) .<br>
Here, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate a button other than the [Folder Select] button from the setting operation button group 85, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140 (ST804-&gt;ST805).<br>
The system microcomputer 140 executes the setting of the operated button in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 (ST805-&gt;ST806).<br>
For example, if the [Protect] button of FIG. 27 is operated, the selected image data is set to the erasure prohibition.  In addition, if the [Erase] button is operated, the selected image data is erased from the recording apparatus 160, and if the [Print Mark] button is operated, a print mark is set for the selected image data.<br>
On the other hand, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Folder Select] button from the setting operation button group 85, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, and<br><br>
generates a GUI screen image 820 for changing the current folder to display it on the display 120 (ST804-&gt;ST807) .<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 28, the GUI screen image 820 is composed of a [Select] button 81b for selecting a desired folder name, a folder name display section 86 for displaying the selected folder name, a folder display section 87 for displaying a folder name in the storing apparatus 160, an image data display section 88 for displaying an image data of the selected folder and the like, a [Determine] button 89 for determining the selected folder, and the like.<br>
When the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Select] button 81b on the GUI screen image 820, the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125 sends out a predetermined control signal to the system microcomputer 140.<br>
The system microcomputer 140 controls the image display device 150 in response to the control signal from the operating section 130 or the GUI section 125, changes the displayed condition of the folder name to be displayed on the folder display section 87 and displays this folder name on the folder name display section 86 to clearly indicate the folder currently being selected and to display the image data recorded in the folder being selected on the image data display section 88.  It is noted that, in a case where a plurality of image data exist, the image data within the folder can be sequentially displayed on the image data display section 88 by operating the [Select] button 81b (ST807-&gt;ST808) .<br>
Here, when the operating section 130 is operated or the LCD panel is touched to operate the [Determine]<br><br>
button 89, the folder currently being selected is changed to the current folder (ST808-&gt;ST809) .<br>
Until the [Determine] button 89 is operated, it is in a standby state (ST809-&gt;ST808-&gt;ST809-&gt;-••).<br>
When the current folder is changed, the system microcomputer 140 again obtains the image data information of the current folder in the recording apparatus 160 or sub-recording apparatus 165, generates the index image information of the image data recorded in the current folder, and displays the GUI screen image 800 based on the generated index image information on the display 120 (ST809-&gt;ST800-&gt;ST801-&gt;•• • ) .<br>
As described above, the imaging apparatus of the present invention results in the following excellent effects.<br>
The I Personal Menu] enables generation of the unique menu information, in which only items frequently used is selected, and the GUI screen image for the [Personal Menu] includes buttons for editing menu information and buttons for selecting the [Main Menu] so that it: is possible to reach a target setting screen image with less number of steps and to edit the menu information with ease.<br>
Arrangement of the button for selecting the [Personal Menu] at a higher stage of the hierarchical type [Main Menu] improves operability in menu selection.<br>
The setting items can be seamlessly scroll-displayed on the GUI screen image, and the relation between the index information (symbol) and the setting item is also displayed on the screen, and the shift to the GUI screen image corresponding to this screen image<br><br>
display is possible so that operation with intuitiveness and less number of steps is made possible and the time and steps in selecting the setting item are greatly reduced.<br>
On the GUI screen image, if the operation is not performed, only the [Return] button is displayed, and if the operation is performed, it is changed to the display of only the [Determine] button to determine that operation.  Thus, only the operable button is displayed, and whether or not the operation is carried out on the GUI screen image currently being displayed is made clear, which enables operation without any question.<br>
In addition, since the number of the buttons to be displayed is reduced, the space for the screen image is made larger and the design can be also unified, thereby improving the visibility of the GUI screen image.<br>
In the GUI screen image for setting the numeric data, the range of the setting values corresponding to the respective setting items can be efficiently displayed and can be intuitively viewed, thereby improving the operability and the visibility.<br>
It is possible to display only the necessary icons and character information in a predetermined layout condition, depending on the apparatus condition, so that the visibility of the display screen image is improved.<br>
Since a screen image corresponding to the operation is overlap-displayed on the forefront of the GUI screen image being displayed, the screen image being displayed is not erased and the previously displayed screen image is displayed after the operation is ended. Thus, even if a plurality of screen images are overlap-displayed, it is<br><br>
possible to easily distinguish them and to reduce uncomfortable feeling to the user.<br>
Furthermore, even in a case where a plurality of folders exist in the recording apparatus or the recording medium, the operability is improved at the time when the folder is selected or altered or when the image data in the folder is viewed.<br><br>
