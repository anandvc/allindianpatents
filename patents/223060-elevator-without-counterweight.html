				<td>ELEVATOR WITHOUT COUNTERWEIGHT<br>
The present invention relates to an elevator without counterweight.<br>
One of the objectives in elevator development work is to achieve efficient and<br>
economical utilization of building space. In recent years, this development work has<br>
produced various elevator solutions without machine room, among other things. Good<br>
examples of elevators without machine room are disclosed in specifications EP 0 631 967<br>
(A1) and EP 0 631 968. The elevators described in these specifications are fairly efficient<br>
 in respect of space utilization as they have made it possible to eliminate the space<br>
 required by the elevator machine room in the building without a need to enlarge the<br>
elevator shaft. In the elevators disclosed in these specifications, the machine is compact<br>
at least in one direction, but in other direction it may have much larger dimensions than a<br>
conventional elevator machine.<br>
In these basically good elevator solutions, the space required by the hoisting<br>
machine limits the freedom of choice in elevator lay-out solutions. Space is needed for the<br>
arrangements required for the passage of the hoisting ropes. It is difficult to reduce the<br>
space required by the elevator car itself on its track and likewise the space required by the<br>
counterweight, at least at a reasonable cost and without impairing elevator performance<br>
and operational quality. In a traction sheave elevator without machine room, mounting<br>
the hoisting machine in the elevator shaft is often difficult, especially in a solution<br>
with machine above, because the hoisting machine is a sizeable body of<br>
considerable weight. Especially in the case of larger loads, speeds and / or hoisting<br>
heights, the size and weight of the machine are a problem regarding in-<br>
stallation, even so much so that the required machine<br>
size and weight have in practice limited the sphere of<br>
application of the concept of elevator without machine<br>
room or at least retarded the introduction of said<br>
concept in larger elevators. In modernization of ele-<br>
vators, the space available in the elevator shaft of-<br>
ten limits the area of application of the concept of<br>
elevator without machine room. In many cases, espe-<br>
cially when hydraulic elevators are modernized or re-<br>
placed, it is not practical to apply the concept of<br>
roped elevator without machine room due to insuffi-<br>
cient space in the shaft, especially in a case where<br>
the hydraulic elevator solution to be modern-<br>
ized/replaced has no counterweight. A disadvantage<br>
with elevators provided with a counterweight is the<br>
cost of the counterweight and the space it requires in<br>
the shaft. Drum elevators, which are nowadays rarely<br>
used, have the drawbacks of requiring heavy and com-<br>
plex hoisting machines with a high power consumption.<br>
The object of the present invention is to achieve at<br>
least one of the following objectives. On the one<br>
hand, it is an aim the invention to develop the eleva-<br>
tor without machine room further so as to allow more<br>
effective space utilization in the building and eleva-<br>
tor shaft than before. This means that the elevator<br>
should permit of being installed in a fairly narrow<br>
elevator shaft if necessary. On the other hand, it is<br>
an aim of the invention to reduce the size and/or<br>
weight of the elevator or at least its machine. One<br>
objective is to achieve an elevator in which the<br>
hoisting rope of an elevator with thin hoisting rope<br>
and/or a small traction sheave has a good grip/contact<br>
on the traction sheave. A further aim of the invention<br>
is to achieve an elevator solution without counter-<br>
weight without compromising on the properties of the<br>
elevator.<br>
The object of the invention should be achieved without compromising the possibility<br>
of varying the basic layout of the elevator.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an elevator without counterweight, and<br>
preferably an elevator without machine room, in which elevator a hoisting machine<br>
engages a set of hoisting ropes by means of a traction sheave, an elevator car being at<br>
least partially supported by said hoisting ropes, which serve as a means of moving the<br>
elevator car, characterized in that the elevator car is suspended on the hoisting ropes by<br>
means of at least one diverting pulley from whose rim the hoisting ropes go upwards from<br>
both sides and at least one diverting pulley from whose rim the hoisting ropes go<br>
downwards from both sides of the diverting pulley, and in which elevator the guide rails<br>
are arranged on one side of the elevator car. Some inventive embodiments are also<br>
disclosed in the descriptive section of the present application. The inventive content of the<br>
application can also be defined differently than in the claims presented below. The<br>
inventive content may also consist of several separate inventions, especially if the<br>
invention is considered in the light of expressions or implicit sub-tasks or from the point of<br>
view of advantages or categories of advantages achieved. In this case, some of the<br>
attributes contained in the claims below may be superfluous from the point view of<br>
separate inventive concepts.<br>
By applying the invention, one or more of the following advantages, among others,<br>
can be achieved :<br>
- Using a small traction sheave, a very compact elevator and / or elevator machine<br>
is achieved.<br>
- The small coated traction sheave used allows the weight of the machine to be<br>
easily reduced even to about half of the weight of the machines now generally used in<br>
elevators without machine room. For example, in the case of elevators designed for a<br>
nominal load below 1000 kg, this means machines weighing 100-150 kg or even less. Via<br>
appropriate motor solutions and choices of materials, it is even possible to achieve<br>
machines having a weight below 100 kg or even as small as about 50 kg.<br>
- A good traction sheave grip, which is achieved in<br>
particular by using Double Wrap roping, and light-<br>
weight components allow the weight of the elevator<br>
car to be considerably reduced.<br>
- A compact machine size and thin, substantially round<br>
ropes permit the elevator machine to be relatively<br>
freely placed in the shaft. Thus, the elevator solu-<br>
tion of the invention can be implemented in a fairly<br>
wide variety of ways in the case of both elevators<br>
with machine above and elevators with machine below.<br>
- The elevator machine can be advantageously placed<br>
between the car and a shaft wall.<br>
- All or at least part of the weight of the elevator<br>
car can be carried by the elevator guide rails.<br>
- In elevators applying the invention, a centric sus-<br>
pension arrangement of the elevator car can be read-<br>
ily achieved, thereby reducing the lateral support-<br>
ing forces applied to the guide rails.<br>
- Applying the invention allows effective utilization<br>
of the cross-sectional area of the shaft.<br>
- The invention reduces the installation time and to-<br>
tal installation costs of the elevator.<br>
- The elevator is economical to manufacture and in-<br>
stall because many of its components are smaller and<br>
lighter than those used before.<br>
- The speed governor rope and the hoisting rope are<br>
usually different in respect of their properties and<br>
they can be easily distinguished from each other<br>
during installation if the speed governor rope is<br>
thicker than the hoisting ropes; on the other hand,<br>
the speed governor rope and the hoisting ropes may<br>
also be of identical structure, which will reduce<br>
ambiguities regarding these matters in elevator de-<br>
livery logistics and installation.<br>
— The light, thin ropes are easy to handle, allowing<br>
considerably faster installation.<br>
— E.g. in elevators for a nominal load below 1000 kg,<br>
the thin and strong steel wire ropes of the inven-<br>
tion have a diameter of the order of only 3-5 mm,<br>
although thinner and thicker ropes may also be used.<br>
— With rope diameters of about 6 mm or 8 mm, fairly<br>
large and fast elevators according to the invention<br>
can be achieved.<br>
~ The traction sheave and the rope pulleys are small<br>
and light as compared with those used in conven-<br>
tional elevators.<br>
— The small traction sheave allows the use of smaller<br>
operating brakes.<br>
— The small traction sheave reduces the torque re-<br>
quirement, thus allowing the use of a smaller motor<br>
with smaller operating brakes.<br>
— Because of the smaller traction sheave, a higher ro-<br>
tational speed is needed to achieve a given car<br>
speed, which means that the same motor output power<br>
can be reached by a smaller motor.<br>
— Either coated or uncoated ropes can be used.<br>
— It is possible to implement the traction sheave and<br>
the rope pulleys in such a way that, after the coat-<br>
ing on the pulley has been worn out, the rope will<br>
bite firmly on the pulley and thus a sufficient grip<br>
between rope and pulley in this emergency is main-<br>
tained.<br>
The use of a small traction sheave makes it possible<br>
to use a smaller elevator drive motor, which means a<br>
reduction in drive motor acquisition/manufacturing<br>
costs.<br>
The invention can be applied in gearless and geared<br>
elevator motor solutions.<br>
Although the invention is primarily intended for use<br>
in elevators without machine room, it can also be<br>
applied in elevators with machine room.<br>
In the invention a better grip and a better contact<br>
between the hoisting ropes and the traction sheave<br>
are achieved by increasing the contact angle between<br>
them.<br>
Due to the improved grip, the size and weight of the<br>
car can be reduced.<br>
The space saving potential of the elevator of the<br>
invention is increased considerably as the space re-<br>
quired by the counterweight is at least partially<br>
eliminated.<br>
In the elevator of the invention, a lighter and<br>
smaller machine and/or motor can be used<br>
As a result of the lighter and smaller elevator sys-<br>
tem, energy savings and at the same time cost sav-<br>
ings are achieved.<br>
The placement of the machine in the shaft can be<br>
relatively freely chosen as the space required by<br>
the counterweight and counterweight guide rails can<br>
be used for other purposes<br>
By mounting at least the elevator hoisting machine,<br>
the traction sheave and a rope sheave functioning as<br>
a diverting pulley in a complete unit-, which is fit-<br>
ted as a part of the elevator of the invention, con-<br>
siderable savings in installation time and costs<br>
will be achieved.<br>
In the elevator solution of the invention, it is<br>
possible to dispose all ropes in the shaft on one<br>
side of the elevator car; for example, in the case<br>
of rucksack type solutions, the ropes can be ar-<br>
ranged to run behind the elevator car in the space<br>
between the elevator car and the back wall of the<br>
elevator shaft.<br>
The invention makes it easy to implement scenic-type<br>
elevator solutions as well.<br>
Since the elevator solution of the invention does<br>
not necessarily comprise a counterweight, it is pos-<br>
sible to implement elevator solutions in which the<br>
elevator car has doors in several walls, in an ex-<br>
treme case even in all the walls of the elevator<br>
car. In this case, the elevator car guide rails are<br>
disposed at the corners of the elevator car.<br>
- The elevator solution of the invention can be imple-<br>
mented with several different machine solutions.<br>
- The suspension of the car can be implemented using<br>
almost any suitable suspension ratio.<br>
The primary area of application of the invention is<br>
elevators designed for the transportation of _gepple<br>
and/or freight. A typical area of application of the<br>
invention is in elevators whose speed range is about<br>
1.0 m/s or below but may also be higher. For example,<br>
an elevator having a traveling speed of 0.6 m/s is<br>
easy to implement according to the invention.<br>
In both passenger and freight elevators, many of the<br>
advantages achieved through the invention are pro-<br>
nouncedly brought out even in elevators for only 2-4<br>
people, and distinctly already in elevators for 6-8<br>
people (500 - 630 kg).<br>
In the elevator of the invention, normal elevator<br>
hoisting ropes, such as generally used steel ropes,<br>
are applicable. In the elevator, it is possible to use<br>
ropes made of artificial materials and ropes in which<br>
the load-bearing part is made of artificial fiber,<br>
such as e.g. so-called "aramid ropes", which have re-<br>
cently been proposed for use in elevators. Applicable<br>
solutions include also steel-reinforced flat ropes,<br>
especially because they allow a small deflection ra-<br>
dius. Particularly well applicable in the elevator of<br>
the invention are elevator hoisting ropes twisted e.g.<br>
from round and strong wires. From round wires, the<br>
rope can be twisted in many ways using wires of dif-<br>
ferent or equal thickness. In ropes well applicable in<br>
the invention, the wire thickness is below 0.4 mm on<br>
an average. Well applicable ropes made from strong<br>
wires are those in which the average wire thickness is<br>
below 0.3 mm or even below 0.2 mm. For instance, thin-<br>
wired and strong 4 mm ropes can be twisted relatively<br>
economically from wires such that the mean wire thick-<br>
ness in the finished rope is in the range of 0.15 ...<br>
0.25 mm, while the thinnest wires may have a thickness<br>
as small as only about 0.1 mm. Thin rope wires can<br>
easily be made very strong. In the invention, rope<br>
wires having a strength greater than 2000 N/mm2 are<br>
used. A suitable range of rope wire strength is 2300-<br>
2700 N/mm2. In principle, it is possible to use rope<br>
wires having a strength of up to about 3000 N/mm2 or<br>
even more.<br>
The elevator of the invention is preferably an eleva-<br>
tor without machine room, in which elevator the hoist-<br>
ing machine engages the hoisting ropes by means of a<br>
traction sheave, the elevator car being at least partially supported by said hoisting ropes,<br>
which serve as transmission means for moving the elevator car. The elevator car is<br>
connected to the hoisting ropes via at least one diverting pulley from the rim of which the<br>
hoisting ropes go upwards from both sides of the diverting pulley, and at least one<br>
diverting pulley from the rim of which the hoisting ropes go downwards from both sides of<br>
the diverting pulley, and in which elevator the traction sheave engages the rope portion<br>
between these diverting pulleys.<br>
By increasing the contact angle by means of a rope sheave functioning as a<br>
diverting pulley, the grip between the traction sheave and the hoisting ropes can be<br>
increased. In this way, the car can be made lighter and its size can be reduced, thus<br>
increasing the space saving potential of the elevator. A contact angle of over 180°<br>
between the traction sheave and the hoisting rope is achieved by using one or more<br>
diverting pulleys.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in detail by the aid of a few<br>

Fig. 1 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of the elevator. The elevator is preferably<br>
an elevator without machine room, with a drive machine<br>
10 placed in the elevator shaft. The elevator shown in<br>
the figure is a traction sheave elevator without coun-<br>
terweight and with machine above. The passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes 3 of the elevator is as follows: One<br>
end of the ropes is immovably fixed to an anchorage 16<br>
in the upper part of the shaft, from where the ropes 3<br>
go further to a diverting pulley 15 placed in the up-<br>
per part of the shaft and from which diverting pulley<br>
15 the ropes go further to a diverting pulley 13<br>
placed above the elevator car, from which diverting<br>
pulley 13 the ropes go further to upwards to the trac-<br>
tion sheave 11 of the drive machine 10, passing around<br>
it along the rope grooves of the traction sheave. From<br>
the traction sheave 11, the ropes 3 go further down-<br>
wards past the elevator car 1 moving along the eleva-<br>
tor guide rails 2 to a diverting pulley 4 placed in<br>
the lower part of the shaft, going further from di-<br>
verting pulley 4 to a diverting pulley below the ele-<br>
vator car, from where the ropes 3 go further to a di-<br>
verting pulley 6 in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft and then further to a diverting pulley 7 below<br>
the elevator car, from where the ropes 3 go further to<br>
an anchorage 9 in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft, to which the other end of the ropes 3 is im-<br>
movably secured. At the lower anchorage of the hoist-<br>
ing rope 3 there is also rope tensioning element 8, by<br>
means of which the rope tension can be adjusted. The<br>
tensioning element 8 may be e.g. a spring or a weight<br>
hanging freely at the end of the rope or some other<br>
appropriate tensioning element solution. In a pre-<br>
ferred case, the drive machine 10 may be fixed e.g. to<br>
a car guide rail, and the diverting pulley 15 in the<br>
upper part of the shaft is mounted on the beams in the<br>
upper part of the shaft, which are fastened to the car<br>
guide rails 2. The diverting pulleys 5,7,13,14 on the<br>
elevator car are mounted on beams above and below the<br>
car. The diverting pulleys in the lower part of the<br>
shaft are preferably mounted on the shaft floor. In<br>
Fig. 1, the traction sheave engages the rope portion<br>
between diverting pulleys 13 and 5, which is a prefer-<br>
able solution according to the invention.<br>
The drive machine 10 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of a flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared<br>
with its width and/or height, or at least the machine<br>
is slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. In the<br>
elevator of the invention, it is possible to use a<br>
drive machine 10 of almost any type and design that<br>
fits into the space intended for it. For example, it<br>
is possible to use a geared or a gearless machine. The<br>
machine may be of a compact and/or flat size. In the<br>
suspension solutions according to the invention, the<br>
rope speed is often high as compared to the speed of<br>
the elevator, so it is possible to use even unsophis-<br>
ticated machine types as the basic machine solution.<br>
The elevator shaft is advantageously provided with<br>
equipment required for the supply of power to the mo-<br>
tor driving the traction sheave 11 as well as equip-<br>
ment needed for elevator control, both of which can be<br>
placed in a common instrument panel 12 or mounted<br>
separately from each other or integrated partly or<br>
completely with the drive machine 10. A preferable so-<br>
lution is a gearless machine comprising a permanent<br>
magnet motor. The drive machine may be fixed to a wall<br>
of the elevator shaft, to the ceiling, to a guide rail<br>
or to some other structure, such as a beam or frame.<br>
In the case of an elevator with machine below, a fur-<br>
ther possibility is to mount the machine on the bottom<br>
of the elevator shaft. Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred<br>
suspension solution in which the suspension ratio of<br>
the diverting pulleys above the elevator car and the<br>
diverting pulleys below the elevator car is the same<br>
4:1 suspension in both cases. Other suspension solu-<br>
tions can also be used to implement the invention. The<br>
elevator presented in the figure has automatic tele-<br>
scoping doors, but other types of automatic doors or<br>
turning doors may also be used within the framework of<br>
the invention. The elevator of the invention can also<br>
be implemented as a solution comprising a machine<br>
room, or the machine may be mounted to be movable to-<br>
gether with the elevator. In the invention, the di-<br>
verting pulleys connected to the elevator car may be<br>
preferably mounted on one and the same beam, which<br>
supports both the diverting pulleys above the car and<br>
the diverting pulleys below the car. This beam may be<br>
fitted on top of the car, on the side of the car or<br>
below the car, on the car frame or in some other ap-<br>
propriate place in the car structure. The diverting<br>
pulleys may also be fitted each one separately in ap-<br>
propriate places on the car and in the shaft.<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagram representing another trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator according to the invention. In<br>
this elevator, the ropes go upward from the machine.<br>
This type of elevator is generally a traction sheave<br>
elevator with machine below. The elevator car 201 is<br>
suspended on the hoisting ropes 203 of the elevator.<br>
The elevator drive machine unit 210 is mounted in the<br>
elevator shaft, preferably in the lower part of the<br>
shaft. The elevator car 2 01 moves in the elevator<br>
shaft along an elevator guide rail 202 guiding it.<br>
In Fig. 2, the hoisting ropes run as follows: One end<br>
of the ropes is fixed to an anchorage 216 in the upper<br>
part of the shaft, from where it goes downward to a<br>
diverting pulley 213, from which the ropes go further<br>
upward to a first diverting pulley 215 mounted in the<br>
upper part of the shaft and from diverting pulley 215<br>
to a diverting pulley 214 on the elevator car 201,<br>
from where it returns to a diverting pulley 219 in the<br>
upper part of the shaft. From diverting pulley 219,<br>
the hoisting ropes go further to the traction sheave<br>
211 driven by the drive machine 210. From the traction<br>
sheave, the ropes go again upwards to a diverting pul-<br>
ley 204 mounted below the car, and having wrapped<br>
around it the hoisting ropes run via a diverting pul-<br>
ley 220 mounted in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft back to a second diverting pulley 205 below the<br>
car, from where the ropes go further to an anchorage<br>
209 in the lower part of the elevator shaft, where the<br>
other end of the hoisting ropes is fixed. A rope ten-<br>
sioning element 208 is also provided at the lower rope<br>
anchorage. The elevator presented in Fig. 2 is a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator with machine below, in which the<br>
suspension ratio both above and below the car is 4:1.<br>
In addition, a smaller shaft space is needed above or<br>
below the elevator car because the rope sheaves used<br>
as diverting pulleys have small diameters as compared<br>
with earlier solutions, depending on how the rope<br>
sheaves are mounted on the elevator car and/or the<br>
frame of the elevator car.<br>
Fig. 3 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 310 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in Fig. 3 is a traction<br>
sheave elevator with machine above, in which the sus-<br>
pension ratio above and below the elevator car is 6:1.<br>
The passage of the hoisting ropes 303 of the elevator<br>
is as follows: One end of the ropes 303 is immovably<br>
fixed to an anchorage 316 in the upper part of the<br>
shaft, from where the ropes run downwards to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 315 mounted at the side of the elevator<br>
car, from where the ropes run further to the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft, passing around a diverting<br>
pulley 320, from which the ropes 303 go further down-<br>
wards to diverting pulley 314, from which they return<br>
downwards to diverting pulley 313. Via the rope<br>
grooves of diverting pulley 313, the hoisting ropes<br>
run further upwards to the traction sheave 311 of the<br>
drive machine 310, passing around the traction sheave<br>
along the rope grooves on the sheave. From the trac-<br>
tion sheave 311, the ropes 303 run further downwards<br>
to diverting pulley 322, wrapping around it along the<br>
rope grooves of the diverting pulley and then return-<br>
ing back up to the traction sheave 311, over which the<br>
ropes run in the traction sheave rope grooves. From<br>
the traction sheave 311, the ropes 303 go further<br>
downwards via the rope grooves of diverting pulley 322<br>
to a diverting pulley 307 placed in the lower part of<br>
the elevator shaft, from where they go further to the<br>
elevator car 301 moving along the car guide rails 3 02<br>
of the elevator and to a diverting pulley 306 mounted<br>
at its lower edge. The ropes are passed between the<br>
diverting pulleys 318,319 in the lower part of the<br>
elevator shaft and the diverting pulleys 306,3 05,304<br>
in the lower part of the elevator car as many times as<br>
necessary to achieve the same suspension ratio for the<br>
portion above the elevator car and the portion below<br>
the car. After this, the rope goes downwards to an an-<br>
chorage element 308, e.g. a weight, which functions as<br>
a rope tensioning element hanging freely at the other<br>
end of the rope. In the case presented in the figure,<br>
the hoisting machine and the diverting pulleys are<br>
preferably all placed on one and the same side of the<br>
elevator car. This solution is particularly advanta-<br>
geous in the case of a rucksack elevator solution, in<br>
which case the above-mentioned components are disposed<br>
behind the elevator car, in the space between the back<br>
wall of the elevator car and the back wall of the<br>
shaft. In a rucksack solution like this, the elevator<br>
guide rails 3 02 may preferably be disposed e.g. in the<br>
frontmost part of the elevator car at the sides of the<br>
elevator car/elevator car frame. The roping arrange-<br>
ment between the traction sheave 311 and the diverting<br>
pulley 322 is referred to as Double Wrap roping,<br>
wherein the hoisting ropes are wrapped around the<br>
traction sheave two and/or more times. In this way,<br>
the contact angle can be increased in two and/or more<br>
stages. For example, in the embodiment presented in<br>
Fig. 3, a contact angle of 180° + 180°, i.e. 360 ° be-<br>
tween the traction sheave 311 and the hoisting ropes<br>
303 is achieved. The Double Wrap roping presented in<br>
the figure can also be arranged in another way, e.g.<br>
by placing the diverting pulley on the side of the<br>
traction sheave, in which case, as the hoisting ropes<br>
pass twice around the traction sheave, a contact angle<br>
of 180° + 90° = 270° is achieved, or by placing the<br>
traction sheave in some other appropriate location. A<br>
preferable solution is to dispose the traction sheave<br>
311 and the diverting pulley 322 in such a way that<br>
the diverting pulley 322 will also function as a guide<br>
of the hoisting ropes 303 and as a damping wheel. An-<br>
other advantageous solution is to build a complete<br>
unit comprising both an elevator drive machine with a<br>
traction sheave and one or more diverting pulleys with<br>
bearings in a correct operating angle relative to the<br>
traction sheave to increase the contact angle. The op-<br>
erating angle is determined by the roping used between<br>
the traction sheave an the diverting pulley/diverting<br>
pulleys, which defines the way in which the mutual po-<br>
sitions and angle between the traction sheave and di-<br>
verting pulley/diverting pulleys relative to each<br>
other are fitted in the unit. This unit can be mounted<br>
in place as a unitary aggregate in the same way as a<br>
drive machine. The drive machine may be fixed to a<br>
wall of the elevator shaft, to the ceiling, to a guide<br>
rail or guide rails or to some other structure, such<br>
as a beam or frame. In Double Wrap roping, when the<br>
diverting pulley is of substantially equal size with<br>
the traction sheave, the diverting pulley can also<br>
function as a damping wheel. In this case, the ropes<br>
going from the traction sheave to the counterweight<br>
and to the elevator car are passed via the rope<br>
grooves of the diverting pulley and the rope deflec-<br>
tion caused by the diverting pulley is very small. It<br>
could be said that the ropes coming from the traction<br>
sheave only touch the diverting pulley tangentially.<br>
Such tangential contact serves as a solution damping<br>
the vibrations of the outgoing ropes and it can be ap-<br>
plied in other roping solutions as well.<br>
Fig. 4 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of a fourth elevator according to the inven-<br>
tion. The elevator is preferably an elevator without<br>
machine room, with a drive machine 410 placed in the<br>
elevator shaft. The elevator shown in Fig. 4 is a<br>
traction sheave elevator with machine above and having<br>
a suspension ratio of 7:1 above and below the elevator<br>
car, which is a very advantageous implementation of<br>
the invention in respect of suspension ratio. The pas-<br>
sage of the hoisting ropes is mainly similar to that<br>
in Fig. 3, but in this figure the starting point of<br>
the hoisting ropes 403 is on the elevator car 401, to<br>
which the rope is substantially immovably secured.<br>
With this arrangement, an odd suspension ratio is<br>
achieved for the portion above the elevator car. A<br>
further difference from Fig. 3 is that the number of<br>
diverting pulleys mounted in the upper part of the<br>
elevator shaft larger by one than in Fig. 3. The pas-<br>
sage of ropes to the hoisting machine 410 follows the<br>
same principle as in Fig. 3. From the hoisting machine<br>
410, hoisting rope runs between the diverting pulleys<br>
407,418,419,423 in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shatt and the diverting pulleys 406,405,404 mounted<br>
below the elevator car on the same principle as in<br>
Fig. 3. In the portion below the elevator car, the<br>
same suspension ratio, i.e. an odd suspension ratio of<br>
7:1, is achieved by fixing the ropes to an anchorage<br>
425 on the elevator car 401. Placed at this fixing<br>
point is also a rope tensioning element. In Fig. 4<br>
there is also a difference from Fig. 3 in respect of<br>
the roping between the traction sheave 411 and the di-<br>
verting pulley 422. The roping arrangement presented<br>
in Fig. 4 can also be called X Wrap (XW) roping. Pre-<br>
viously known concepts are Double Wrap (DW) roping,<br>
Single Wrap (SW) roping and Extended Single Wrap (ESW)<br>
roping. In X Wrap roping, the hoisting ropes are<br>
caused to wrap around the traction sheave 411 with a<br>
large contact angle. For example, in the case pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 4, a contact angle well over 180°, i.e.<br>
about 27 0 ° between the traction sheave 411 and the<br>
hoisting ropes is achieved. X Wrap roping presented in<br>
the figure can also be arranged in another way, e.g.<br>
by providing two diverting pulleys at appropriate po-<br>
sitions near the drive machine. In Fig. 4, diverting<br>
pulley 422 has been fitted in place at an angle rela-<br>
tive to the traction sheave 807 such that the ropes<br>
will run crosswise in a manner known in itself so that<br>
the ropes are not damaged. In this figure, the passage<br>
of the hoisting ropes from diverting pulley 413 is so<br>
arranged that ropes run via the rope grooves of di-<br>
verting pulley 422 to the traction sheave 411 of the<br>
drive machine 410, wrapping around it along the trac-<br>
tion sheave rope grooves. From the traction sheave<br>
411, the ropes 403 go further downwards, passing<br>
crosswise with the ropes going upwards and further<br>
downwards via the rope grooves of the diverting pulley<br>
to diverting pulley 407.<br>
Fig. 5 presents 1 a diagram illustrating the structure<br>
of an elevator according to the invention. The eleva-<br>
tor is preferably an elevator without machine room,<br>
with a drive machine 510 placed in the elevator shaft.<br>
The elevator shown in the figure is a traction sheave<br>
elevator with machine above and with a 9:1 suspension<br>
ratio both above and below the elevator car. The pas-<br>
sage of the hoisting ropes 503 of the elevator is as<br>
follows: One end of the ropes is substantially immova-<br>
bly fixed relative to the elevator car at a fixing<br>
point 530 so as to be movable with the elevator car,<br>
from where the ropes go upwards to a diverting pulley<br>
525 in the upper part of the shaft, from which pulley<br>
they run further in the manner described above between<br>
diverting pulleys 525,513,524,514,520,515,521,526, and<br>
from which diverting pulleys the ropes 503 go further<br>
to the traction sheave 511 of the drive machine 510,<br>
passing around it along the rope grooves of the trac-<br>
tion sheave. From the traction sheave 511, the hoist-<br>
ing ropes 3 03 go further downwards, passing crosswise<br>
with the ropes going upwards, to diverting pulley 522,<br>
passing around it along the rope grooves of the di-<br>
verting pulley 522. From diverting pulley 522, the<br>
ropes 503 go further downwards to a diverting pulley<br>
528 in the lower part of the elevator shaft. The ropes<br>
then run further from diverting pulley 528 upwards be-<br>
tween the diverting pulleys 504,505,506,507 in the<br>
lower part of the elevator car and the diverting pul-<br>
leys 528,527,526,519,518 in the lower part of the ele-<br>
vator shaft in the manner described in connection with<br>
the preceding figures, in Fig. 5, an odd suspension<br>
ratio is achieved below the elevator car as well by<br>
having the hoisting rope fixed substantially immovably<br>
relative to the elevator car at a fixing point 531, to<br>
which fixing point is also fitted a mounting element.<br>
The roping arrangement used between the traction<br>
sheave 511 and diverting pulley 522 is called Extended<br>
Single Wrap roping. In Extended Single Wrap roping,<br>
the hoisting ropes is caused to wrap around the trac-<br>
tion sheave with a larger contact angle by using a di-<br>
verting pulley. For example, in the case illustrated<br>
in Fig. 5, the contact angle between the traction<br>
sheave 511 and the hoisting ropes 503 is well over<br>
180°, i.e. about 270°. The Extended Single Wrap roping<br>
presented in Fig. 5 can also be arranged in another<br>
way, e.g. by disposing the traction sheave and the di-<br>
verting pulley in a different manner relative to each<br>
other, for example the other way round with respect to<br>
each other than in Fig. 5. The diverting pulley 522 is<br>
fitted in place at an angle relative to the traction<br>
sheave 511 such that the ropes pass crosswise in a<br>
manner known in itself so that the ropes are not dam-<br>
aged.<br>
Fig. 6 presents a partially sectioned view of a rope<br>
sheave 600 applying the invention. The rope grooves<br>
601 are under a coating 602 on the rim 606 of the rope<br>
sheave. Provided in the hub of the rope sheave is a<br>
space 603 for a bearing used to mount the rope sheave.<br>
The rope sheave is also provided with holes 605 for<br>
bolts, allowing the rope sheave to be fastened by its<br>
side to an anchorage in the hoisting machine 10, e.g.<br>
to a rotating flange, to form a traction sheave 11, so<br>
that no bearing separate from the hoisting machine is<br>
needed. The coating material used on the traction<br>
sheave and the rope sheaves may consist of rubber,<br>
polyurethane or a corresponding elastic material that<br>
increases friction. The material of the traction<br>
sheave and/or rope sheaves may also be so chosen that,<br>
together with the hoisting rope used, it forms a mate-<br>
rial pair such that the hoisting rope will bite into<br>
the pulley after the coating on the pulley has been<br>
worn out. This ensures a sufficient grip between the<br>
rope sheave 600 and the hoisting rope 3 in an emer-<br>
gency where the coating 602 has been worn out from the<br>
rope sheave 600. This feature allows the elevator to<br>
maintain its functionality and operational reliability<br>
in the situation referred to. The traction sheave<br>
and/or the rope sheaves can also be manufactured in<br>
such manner that only the rim 606 of the rope sheave<br>
600 is made of a material forming a grip increasing<br>
material pair with the hoisting rope 3. The use of<br>
strong hoisting ropes that are considerably thinner<br>
than normally allows the traction sheave and the rope<br>
sheaves to be designed to considerably smaller dimen-<br>
sions and sizes than when normal-sized ropes are used.<br>
This also makes it possible to use a motor of a<br>
smaller size with a lower torque as the drive motor of<br>
the elevator, which leads to a reduction in the acqui-<br>
sition costs of the motor. For example, in an elevator<br>
according to the invention designed for a nominal load<br>
below 1000 kg, the traction sheave diameter is pref-<br>
erably 120-200 mm, but it may even be less than this.<br>
The traction sheave diameter depends on the thickness<br>
of the hoisting ropes used. In the elevator of the in-<br>
vention, the use of small traction sheaves, e.g. in<br>
the case of elevators for a nominal load below 1000<br>
kg, makes it possible to achieve a machine weight even<br>
as low as about one half of the weight of currently<br>
used machines, which means producing elevator machines<br>
weighing 100-150 kg or even less. In the invention,<br>
the machine is understood as comprising at least the<br>
traction sheave, the motor, the machine housing struc-<br>
tures and the brakes. The traction sheave diameter de-<br>
pends on the thickness of the hoisting ropes used.<br>
Conventionally a diameter ratio D/d=40 or higher is<br>
used, where D = traction sheave diameter and d =<br>
hoisting rope thickness. At the expense of wear resis-<br>
tance of the rope, this ratio can be reduced somewhat.<br>
Alternatively, without compromising the service life<br>
of the ropes, the D/d ratio can be reduced if at the<br>
same time the number of ropes is increased, in which<br>
case the stress per rope will be smaller. Such a D/d<br>
ratio below 40 could be e.g. a D/d ratio of about 30<br>
or even less, e.g. D/d=25. Often however, reducing the<br>
D/d ratio considerably below 30 radically reduces the<br>
useful life of the rope, although this can be compen-<br>
sated by using ropes of special structure. Achieving a<br>
D/d ratio below 20 is in practice very difficult, but<br>
it might be accomplished by using a rope specially de-<br>
signed for this purpose, although such a rope would<br>
very probably be expensive.<br>
The weight of the elevator machine and its supporting<br>
elements used to hold the machine in place in the ele-<br>
vator shaft is at most about 1/5 of the nominal load.<br>
If the machine is exclusively or almost exclusively<br>
supported by one or more elevator guide rails, then<br>
the total weight of the machine and its supporting<br>
elements may be less than about 1/6 or even less than<br>
1/8 of the nominal load. Nominal load of an elevator<br>
means a load defined for elevators of a given size.<br>
The supporting elements of the elevator machine may<br>
include e.g. a beam, carriage or suspension bracket<br>
used to support or suspend the machine on/from a wall<br>
structure or ceiling of the elevator shaft or on the<br>
elevator guide rails, or clamps used to secure the ma-<br>
chine to the sides of the elevator guide rails. It<br>
will be easy to achieve an elevator in which the ma-<br>
chine deadweight without supporting elements is below<br>
1/7 of the nominal load or even about 1/10 of the<br>
nominal load or still less. As an example of machine<br>
weight in the case of an elevator of a given nominal<br>
weight for a nominal load of 630 kg, the combined<br>
weight of the machine and its supporting elements may<br>
be only 75 kg when the traction sheave diameter is 160<br>
mm and hoisting ropes having a diameter of 4 mm are<br>
used, in other words, the total weight of the machine<br>
and its supporting elements is about 1/8 of the nomi-<br>
nal load of the elevator. As another example, with the<br>
same 160 mm traction sheave diameter and the same 4 mm<br>
hoisting rope diameter, in the case of an elevator for<br>
a nominal load of about 1000 kg, the total weight of<br>
the machine and its suspension elements is about 150<br>
kg, so in this case the machine and its supporting<br>
elements have a total weight equaling about 1/6 of the<br>
nominal load. As a third example, in an elevator de-<br>
signed for a nominal load of 1600 kg and with a trac-<br>
tion sheave diameter of 240 mm and a hoisting rope di-<br>
ameter of 6 mm, the total weight of the machine and<br>
its supporting elements will be about 300 kg, in other<br>
words, the total weight of the machine and its sup-<br>
porting elements equals about 1/7 of the nominal load.<br>
By varying the hoisting rope suspension arrangements,<br>
it is possible to reach a still lower total weight of<br>
the machine and its supporting elements. For example,<br>
when a 4:1 suspension ratio, a 160 mm traction sheave<br>
diameter and a 4 mm hoisting rope diameter are used in<br>
an elevator designed for a nominal load of 500 kg, a<br>
total weight of hoisting machine and its supporting<br>
elements of about 50 kg will be achieved. In this<br>
case, the total weight of the machine and its support-<br>
ing elements is as small as only about 1/10 of the<br>
nominal load. When the size of the traction sheave is<br>
substantially reduced and a higher suspension ratio is<br>
used, the torque output required of the motor falls to<br>
a fraction as compared to the starting situation. For<br>
example, if instead of 2:1 suspension a 4:1 suspension<br>
ratio is used and if instead of traction sheave with<br>
diameter of 400 mm a 160-mm traction sheave is used,<br>
then, if the increased losses are disregarded, the<br>
torque requirement falls to one fifth. Therefore, the<br>
machine size is also really considerably reduced.<br>
Fig. 7 presents a solution in which the rope groove<br>
701 is in the coating 702, which is thinner at the<br>
sides of the rope groove than at the bottom. In such a<br>
solution, the coating is placed in a basic groove 720<br>
provided in the rope sheave 700 so that deformations<br>
produced in the coating by the pressure imposed on it<br>
-by the rope will be small and mainly limited to the<br>
rope surface texture sinking into the coating. Such a<br>
solution often means in practice that the rope sheave<br>
coating consists of rope groove-specific sub-coatings<br>
separate from each other, but considering manufactur-<br>
ing or other aspects it may be appropriate to design<br>
the rope sheave coating so that it extends continu-<br>
ously over a number of grooves.<br>
By making the coating thinner at the sides of the<br>
groove than at its bottom, the stress imposed by the<br>
rope on the bottom of the rope groove while sinking<br>
into the groove is avoided or at least reduced. As the<br>
pressure cannot be discharged laterally but is di-<br>
rected by the combined effect of the shape of the ba-<br>
sic groove 720 and the thickness variation of the<br>
coating 7 02 to support the rope in the rope groove<br>
7301, lower maximum surface pressures acting on the<br>
rope and the coating are also achieved. One method of<br>
making a grooved coating 702 like this is to fill the<br>
round-bottomed basic groove 720 with coating material<br>
and then form a half-round rope groove 701 in this<br>
coating material in the basic groove. The shape of the<br>
rope grooves is well supported and the load-bearing<br>
surface layer under the rope provides a better resis-<br>
tance against lateral propagation of the compression<br>
stress produced by the ropes. The lateral spreading or<br>
rather adjustment of the coating caused by the pres-<br>
sure is promoted by thickness and elasticity of the<br>
coating and reduced by hardness and eventual rein-<br>
forcements of the coating. The coating thickness on<br>
the bottom of the rope groove can be made large, even<br>
as large as half the rope thickness, in which case a<br>
hard and inelastic coating is needed. On the other<br>
hand, if a coating thickness corresponding to only<br>
about one tenth of the rope thickness is used, then<br>
the coating material may be clearly softer. An eleva-<br>
tor for eight persons could be implemented using a<br>
coating thickness at the bottom of the groove equal to<br>
about one fifth of the rope thickness if the ropes and<br>
the rope load are chosen appropriately. The coating<br>
thickness should equal at least 2-3 times the depth of<br>
the rope surface texture formed by the surface wires<br>
of the rope. Such a very thin coating, having a thick-<br>
ness even less than the thickness of the surface wire<br>
of the hoisting rope, will not necessarily endure the<br>
strain imposed on it. In practice, the coating must<br>
have a thickness larger than this minimum thickness<br>
because the coating will also have to receive rope<br>
surface variations rougher than the surface texture.<br>
Such a rougher area is formed e.g. where the level<br>
differences between rope strands are larger than those<br>
between wires. In practice, a suitable minimum coating<br>
thickness is about 1-3 times the surface wire thick-<br>
ness . In the case of the ropes normally used in eleva-<br>
tors, which have been designed for a contact with a<br>
metallic rope groove and which have a thickness of 8-<br>
10 mm, this thickness definition leads to a coating at<br>
least about 1 mm thick. Since a coating on the trac-<br>
tion sheave, which causes more rope wear than the<br>
other rope sheaves of the elevator, will reduce rope<br>
wear and therefore also the need to provide the rope<br>
with thick surface wires, the rope can be made<br>
smoother. Rope smoothness can naturally be improved by<br>
coating the rope with a material suited for this pur-<br>
pose, such as e.g. polyurethane or equivalent. The use<br>
of thin wires allows the rope itself to be made thin-<br>
ner, because thin steel wires can be manufactured from<br>
a stronger material than thicker wires. For instance,<br>
using 0.2 mm wires, a 4 mm thick elevator hoisting<br>
rope of a fairly good construction can be produced.<br>
Depending on the thickness of the hoisting rope used<br>
and/or on other factors, the wires in the steel wire<br>
/ rope may preferably have a thickness between 0.15 mm<br>
and 0.5 mm, in which range there are readily available<br>
steel wires with good strength properties in which<br>
even an individual wire has a sufficient wear resis-<br>
tance and a sufficiently low susceptibility to damage.<br>
In the above, ropes made of round steel wires have<br>
been discussed. Applying the same principles, the<br>
ropes can be wholly or partly twisted from non-round<br>
profiled wires. In this case, the cross-sectional ar-<br>
eas of the wires are preferably substantially the same<br>
as for round wires, i.e. in the range of 0.015 mm2 -<br>
0.2 mm2. Using wires in this thickness range, it will<br>
be easy to produce steel wire ropes having a wire<br>
strength above about 2000 N/mm2 and a wire cross-<br>
section of 0.015 mm2 - 0.2 mm2 and comprising a large<br>
cross-sectional area of steel material in relation to<br>
the cross-sectional area of the rope, as is achieved<br>
e.g. by using the Warrington construction. For the im-<br>
plementation of the invention, particularly well<br>
suited are ropes having a wire strength in the range<br>
of 2300 N/m2 - 2700 N/mm2, because such ropes have a<br>
very large bearing capacity in relation to rope thick-<br>
ness while the high hardness of the strong wires in-<br>
volves no substantial difficulties in the use of the<br>
rope in elevators. A traction sheave coating well<br>
suited for such a rope is already clearly below 1 mm<br>
thick. However, the coating should be thick enough to<br>
ensure that it will not be very easily scratched away<br>
or pierced e.g. by an occasional sand grain or similar<br>
particle that may have got between the rope groove and<br>
the hoisting rope. Thus, a desirable minimum coating<br>
thickness, even when thin-wire hoisting ropes are<br>
used, would be about 0.5...1 mm. For hoisting ropes hav-<br>
ing small surface wires and an otherwise relatively<br>
smooth surface, a coating having a thickness of the<br>
form A+Bcosa is well suited. However, such a coating<br>
"is also applicable to ropes whose surface strands meet<br>
the rope groove at a distance from each other, because<br>
if the coating material is sufficiently hard, each<br>
strand meeting the rope groove is in a way separately-<br>
supported and the supporting force is the same and/or<br>
as desired. In the formula A+Bcosa, A and B are con-<br>
stants so that A+B is the coating thickness at the<br>
bottom of the rope groove 701 and the angle a is the<br>
angular distance from the bottom of the rope groove as<br>
measured from the center of curvature of the rope<br>
groove cross-section. Constant A is larger than or<br>
equal to zero, and constant B is always larger than<br>
zero. The thickness of the coating growing thinner to-<br>
wards the edges can also be defined in other ways be-<br>
sides using the formula A+Bcosa so that the elasticity<br>
decreases towards the edges of the rope groove. The<br>
elasticity in the central part of the rope groove can<br>
also be increased by making an undercut rope groove<br>
and/or by adding to the coating on the bottom of the<br>
rope groove a portion of different material of special<br>
elasticity, where the elasticity has been increased,<br>
in addition to increasing the material thickness, by<br>
the use of a material that is softer than the rest of<br>
the coating.<br>
Figures 8a, 8b and 8c present cross-sections of steel<br>
wire ropes used in the invention. The ropes in these<br>
figures contain thin steel wires 803, a coating 802 on<br>
the steel wires and/or partly between the steel wires,<br>
and in Fig. 8a a coating 801 over the steel wires. The<br>
rope presented in Fig. 8b is an uncoated steel wire<br>
rope with a rubber-like filler added to its interior<br>
structure, and Fig. 8a presents a steel wire rope pro-<br>
vided with a coating in addition to a filler added to<br>
the internal structure. The rope presented in Fig. 8c<br>
has a non-metallic core 804, which may be a solid or<br>
fibrous structure made of plastic, natural fiber or<br>
some other material suited for the purpose. A fibrous<br>
structure will be good if the rope is lubricated, in<br>
which case lubricant will accumulate in the fibrous<br>
core. The core thus acts as a kind of lubricant stor-<br>
age. The steel wire ropes of substantially round<br>
cross-section used in the elevator of the invention<br>
may be coated, uncoated and/or provided with a rubber-<br>
like filler, such as e.g. polyurethane or some other<br>
suitable filler, added to the interior structure of<br>
the rope and acting as a kind of lubricant lubricating<br>
the rope and also balancing the pressure between wires<br>
and strands. The use of a filler makes it possible to<br>
achieve a rope that needs no lubrication, so its sur-<br>
face can be dry. The coating used in the steel wire<br>
ropes may be made of the same or nearly the same mate-<br>
rial as the filler or of a material that is better<br>
suited for use as a coating and has properties, such<br>
as friction and wear resistance properties, that are<br>
better suited to the purpose than a filler. The coat-<br>
ing of the steel wire rope may also be so implemented<br>
that the coating material penetrates partially into<br>
the rope or through the entire thickness of the rope,<br>
giving the rope the same properties as the filler men-<br>
tioned above. The use of thin and strong steel wire<br>
ropes according to the invention is possible because<br>
the steel wires used are wires of special strength,<br>
allowing the ropes to be made substantially thin as<br>
compared with steel wire ropes used before. The ropes<br>
presented in Fig. 8a and 8b are steel wire ropes hav-<br>
ing a diameter of about 4 mm. For example, the thin<br>
and strong steel wire ropes of the invention prefera-<br>
bly have a diameter of about 2.5-5 mm in elevators<br>
for a nominal load below 1000 kg, and preferably about<br>
5-8 mm in elevators for a nominal load above 1000<br>
kg. In principle, it is possible to use ropes thinner<br>
than this, but in this case a large number of ropes<br>
will be needed. Still, by increasing the suspension<br>
ratio, ropes thinner than those mentioned above can be<br>
used for corresponding loads, and at the same time a<br>
smaller and lighter elevator machine can be achieved.<br>
In the elevator of the invention, it is also possible<br>
use ropes having a diameter of over 8 mm if necessary.<br>
Likewise, ropes of a diameter below 3 mm can be used.<br>
Figures 9a, 9b, 9c, 9d, 9e, 9f and 9g present some<br>
variations of the roping arrangements according to the<br>
invention that can be used between the traction sheave<br>
907 and the diverting pulley 915 to increase the con-<br>
tact angle between the ropes 903 and the traction<br>
sheave 907, in which arrangements the ropes 903 go<br>
downwards from the drive machine 906 towards the eleva-<br>
tor car and diverting pulleys. These roping arrange-<br>
ments make it possible to increase the contact angle<br>
between the hoisting rope 903 and the traction sheave<br>
907. In the invention, contact angle a refers to the<br>
length of the arc of contact between the traction<br>
sheave and the hoisting rope. The magnitude of the con-<br>
tact angle a may be expressed e.g. in degrees, as is<br>
done in the invention, but it is also possible to ex-<br>
press the magnitude of the contact angle in other<br>
terms, e.g. in radians or equivalent. The contact angle<br>
a is presented in greater detail in Fig. 9a. In the<br>
other figures, the contact angle a is not expressly in-<br>
dicated, but it can be seen from the other figures as<br>
well without specific separate description.<br>
The roping arrangements presented in Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c<br>
represent some variations of the X Wrap roping de-<br>
scribed above. In the arrangement presented in Fig. 9a,<br>
the ropes 903 come via diverting pulley 915, wrapping<br>
around it along rope grooves, to the traction sheave<br>
907, over which the ropes pass along its rope grooves<br>
and then go further back to the diverting pulley 915,<br>
passing crosswise with respect to the rope portion com-<br>
ing from the diverting pulley, and continuing their<br>
passage further. Crosswise passage of the ropes 903 be-<br>
tween the diverting pulley 915 and the traction sheave<br>
907 can be implemented e.g. by having the diverting<br>
pulley fitted at such an angle with respect to the<br>
traction sheave that the ropes will cross each other in<br>
a manner known in itself so that the ropes 903 are not<br>
damaged. In Fig. 9a, the shaded area represents the<br>
contact angle a between the ropes 903 and the traction<br>
sheave 907. The magnitude of the contact angle a in<br>
this figure is about 310°. The size of the diameter of<br>
the diverting pulley can be used as a means of deter-<br>
mining the distance of suspension that is to be pro-<br>
vided between the diverting pulley 915 and the traction<br>
sheave 907. The magnitude of the contact angle can be<br>
varied by varying the distance between the diverting<br>
pulley 915 and the traction sheave 907. The magnitude<br>
of the angle a can also be varied by varying the diame-<br>
ter of the diverting pulley and/or by varying the di-<br>
ameter of the traction sheave and also by varying the<br>
ratio between the diameters of the diverting pulley and<br>
the traction sheave. Fig. 9b and 9c present an example<br>
of implementing a corresponding XW roping arrangement<br>
using two diverting pulleys.<br>
The roping arrangements presented in Fig. 9d and 9e are<br>
different variations of the above-mentioned Double Wrap<br>
roping. In the roping arrangement in Fig. 9d, the ropes<br>
run via the rope grooves of a diverting pulley 915 to<br>
the traction sheave traction sheave 907 of the drive<br>
machine 906, passing over it along the rope grooves of<br>
the traction sheave. From the traction sheave 907, the<br>
ropes 903 go further downwards back to the diverting<br>
pulley 915, wrapping around it along the rope grooves<br>
of the diverting pulley and returning then back to the<br>
traction sheave 907, over which the ropes run in the<br>
rope grooves of the traction sheave. From the traction<br>
sheave 907, the ropes 903 run further downwards via the<br>
rope grooves of the diverting pulley. In the roping ar-<br>
rangement presented in the figure, the hoisting ropes<br>
are caused to wrap around the traction sheave twice<br>
and/or more times. By these means, the contact angle<br>
can be increased in two and/or more stages. For exam-<br>
ple, in the case presented in Fig. 9d, a contact angle<br>
of 180° + 180° between the traction sheave 907 and the<br>
ropes 903 is achieved. In Double Wrap roping, when the<br>
diverting pulley 915 is substantially of equal size<br>
with the traction sheave 907, the diverting pulley 915<br>
also functions as a damping wheel. In this case, the<br>
ropes going from the traction sheave 907 to the divert-<br>
ing pulleys and elevator car pass via the rope grooves<br>
of diverting pulley 915 and the rope deflection pro-<br>
duced by the diverting pulley is very small. It could<br>
be said that the ropes coming from the traction sheave<br>
only touch the diverting pulley tangentially. Such<br>
tangential contact serves as a solution damping the<br>
vibrations of the outgoing ropes and it can be applied<br>
in other roping arrangements as well. In this case,<br>
the diverting pulley 915 also functions as a rope<br>
guide. The ratio of the diameters of the diverting<br>
pulley and traction sheave can be varied by varying<br>
the diameters of the diverting pulley and/or traction<br>
sheave. This can be used as a means of defining the<br>
magnitude of the contact angle and fitting it to a de-<br>
sired magnitude. By using DW roping, forward bending<br>
of the rope 903 is achieved, which means that in DW<br>
roping the rope 903 is bent in the same direction on<br>
the diverting pulley 915 and on the traction sheave<br>
907. DW roping can also be implemented in other ways,<br>
such as e.g. the way illustrated in Fig. 9e, where the<br>
diverting pulley 915 is disposed on the side of the<br>
drive machine 906 and the traction sheave 907. In this<br>
roping arrangement, the ropes 903 are passed in a man-<br>
ner corresponding to Fig. 9d, but in this case a con-<br>
tact angle of 180° + 90°, i.e. 270° is obtained. In DW<br>
roping, if the diverting pulley 915 is placed on the<br>
side of the traction sheave, greater demands are im-<br>
posed on the bearings and mounting of the diverting<br>
pulley because it is exposed to greater stress and<br>
load forces than in the embodiment presented in Fig.<br>
9d.<br>
Fig. 9f presents an embodiment of the invention apply-<br>
ing Extended Single Wrap roping as mentioned above. In<br>
the roping arrangement presented in Fig. 9f, the ropes<br>
903 run to the traction sheave 907 of the drive machine<br>
906, wrapping around it along the rope grooves of the<br>
traction sheave. From the traction sheave 907, the<br>
ropes 903 go further downwards, running crosswise rela-<br>
tive to the upwards going ropes and further to a di-<br>
verting pulley 915, passing over it along the rope<br>
grooves of the diverting pulley 915. From the diverting<br>
pulley 915, the ropes 903 run further on. In Extended<br>
Single Wrap roping, by using a diverting pulley, the<br>
hoisting ropes are caused to wrap around the traction<br>
sheave with a larger contact angle than in ordinary<br>
Single Wrap roping. For example, in the case illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 9f, a contact angle of about 270° be-<br>
tween the ropes 903 and the traction sheave 907 is ob-<br>
tained. The diverting pulley 915 is fitted in place at<br>
an angle such that the ropes run crosswise in a manner<br>
known in itself, so that the ropes are not damaged. By<br>
virtue of the contact angle achieved using Extended<br>
Single Wrap roping, elevators implemented according to<br>
the invention can use a very light elevator car. One<br>
possibility of increasing the contact angle is illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 9g, where the hoisting ropes do not run<br>
crosswise relative to each other after wrapping around<br>
the traction sheave and/or diverting pulley. By using a<br>
roping arrangement like this, it is also possible to<br>
increase the contact angle between the hoisting ropes<br>
903 and the traction sheave 907 of the drive machine<br>
906 to a magnitude substantially over 180°.<br>
Figures 9a,b,c,d,e,f and g present different variations<br>
of roping arrangements between the traction sheave and<br>
the diverting pulley/diverting pulleys, in which the<br>
ropes go downwards from the drive machine towards the<br>
counterweight and the elevator car. In the case of an<br>
elevator embodiment according to the invention with ma-<br>
chine below, these roping arrangements can be inverted<br>
and implemented in a corresponding manner so that the<br>
ropes go upwards from the elevator drive machine to-<br>
wards the diverting pulleys and the elevator car.<br>
Fig. 10 presents yet another embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion, wherein the elevator drive machine 1006 is fitted<br>
together with a diverting pulley 1015 on the same<br>
mounting base 1021 in a ready-made unit 1020, which can<br>
be fitted as such to form a part of an elevator accord-<br>
ing to the invention. The unit 1020 contains the eleva-<br>
tor drive machine 1006, the traction sheave 1007 and<br>
diverting pulley 1015 ready-fitted on the mounting base<br>
1021, the traction sheave and diverting pulley being<br>
ready fitted at a correct operating angle relative to<br>
each other, depending on the roping arrangement used<br>
between the traction sheave 1007 and the diverting pul-<br>
ley 1015. The unit 1020 may comprise more than only one<br>
diverting pulley 1015, or it may only comprise the<br>
drive machine 1006 fitted on the mounting base 1021.<br>
The unit can be mounted in an elevator according to the<br>
invention like a drive machine, the mounting arrange-<br>
ment being described in greater detail in connection<br>
with the previous figures. If necessary, the unit can<br>
be used together with any of the roping arrangements<br>
described above, such as e.g. embodiments using ESW,<br>
DW, SW or XW roping. By fitting the above-described<br>
unit as part of an elevator according to the invention,<br>
considerable savings can be made in installation costs<br>
and in the time required for installation.<br>
Fig. 11 presents an embodiment of the invention<br>
wherein the diverting pulley 1113 of the elevator is<br>
fitted in a ready-made unit 1114, which unit may be<br>
placed in the upper part and/or in the lower part of<br>
the shaft and/or in the elevator car, and in which<br>
unit it is possible to fit several diverting pulleys.<br>
By means of this unit, faster roping is achieved and<br>
the diverting pulleys can be disposed compactly to<br>
form a single structure in a desired place. The unit<br>
can be provided with an unlimited number of diverting<br>
pulleys, and these can be fitted in a desired angle in<br>
the unit.<br>
Fig. 12 shows how the rope sheave 1204 serving to sus-<br>
pend the elevator car and its structures and mounted<br>
on a horizontal beam 123 0 comprised in the structure<br>
supporting the elevator car 1201 is disposed with re-<br>
spect to the beam 1230. The rope sheave 1204 shown in<br>
the figure may have a height equal to or smaller than<br>
that of the beam 1230 comprised in the structure. The<br>
beam 1230 supporting the elevator car 1201 may be<br>
placed either below or above the elevator car. The<br>
rope sheave 1204 may be placed completely or at least<br>
partially inside the beam 1230, as illustrated in the<br>
figure. The passage of the elevator hoisting ropes<br>
1203 in this figure is as follows. The hoisting ropes<br>
1203 come to the coated rope sheave 1204 mounted on<br>
the beam 1230 comprised in the structure supporting<br>
the elevator car 1201, from where the hoisting rope<br>
runs further along the rope grooves of the rope<br>
sheave, protected by the beam. The elevator car 12 01<br>
rests on the beam 1230 comprised in the structure, on<br>
vibration absorbers 1229 placed between them. The beam<br>
123 0 functions at the same time as a rope guard for<br>
the hoisting rope 1203. The beam 1230 may be a C-, U-,<br>
I-, Z-shaped beam or a hollow beam or equivalent. The<br>
beam 123 0 may support several rope sheaves fitted on<br>
it and serving as diverting pulleys in different em-<br>
bodiments of the invention.<br>
Fig.13 presents a traction sheave elevator without<br>
counterweight according to the invention, wherein the<br>
elevator guide rails are arranged on one side of the<br>
elevator car. The elevator car is preferably an eleva-<br>
tor without machine room, with the drive machine 1304<br>
placed in the elevator shaft. The elevator presented<br>
in the figure is a traction sheave elevator without<br>
counterweight and with machine above, in which the<br>
elevator car 1301 moves along guide rails 1302. The<br>
elevator presented in Fig. 13 is a laterally suspended<br>
rucksack elevator in which the elevator car guide<br>
rails 13 02, hoisting machine 1304, diverting pulleys,<br>
rope compensator 1315 and hoisting ropes 1303 are ar-<br>
ranged on one side on the elevator car 1301, which in<br>
this case means on the right-hand side on the elevator<br>
car 1301 as seen from the door opening towards the<br>
elevator shaft. This arrangement can also be imple-<br>
mented on any side on the elevator car 1301, such as<br>
e.g. in a rucksack solution in the space between the<br>
back wall on the elevator car and the elevator shaft.<br>
In Fig. 3, the hoisting rope compensator 1315 com-<br>
prises two wheel-like bodies fitted to each other,<br>
which preferably are wheels, and which in the situa-<br>
tion illustrated in Fig. 13 are attached to the eleva-<br>
tor car 1301. Of the wheel-like bodies, the pulley<br>
connected to the hoisting rope portion below the ele-<br>
vator car has a larger diameter than the pulley con-<br>
nected to the hoisting rope portion above the elevator<br>
car. The diameter ratio between the diameters deter-<br>
mines the magnitude of the tension force acting on the<br>
hoisting rope and therefore the compensating force of<br>
the hoisting rope elongations and the length of the<br>
rope elongation compensated by the rope compensator.<br>
In this solution, the use of pulleys provides the ad-<br>
vantage that such a structure will compensate even<br>
very large rope elongations. By varying the size of<br>
the diameter of the tensioning pulleys, it is possible<br>
to influence the magnitude of the rope elongation to<br>
be compensated and the ratio between the rope forces<br>
acting on the traction sheave, which ratio can be kept<br>
constant by the arrangement in question. In the case<br>
of a high suspension ratio or a large hoisting height,<br>
the length of the rope used in the elevator is large.<br>
In this case, it is of essential importance for the<br>
operation and safety of the elevator that a sufficient<br>
tension be maintained in the rope portion below the<br>
elevator and the amount of rope elongation to be com-<br>
pensated is large. In the case of odd suspension ra-<br>
tios above and below the elevator car, the compensat-<br>
ing device 1315 is fitted in conjunction with the ele-<br>
vator car 1301, and in the case of even suspension ra-<br>
tios it is fitted in the elevator shaft or in some<br>
other appropriate place. In the solution, the compen-<br>
sating device 1315 may be implemented using two pul-<br>
leys as shown in Fig. 13, but the number of wheel-like<br>
bodies may vary; for example, it is possible to use<br>
only one pulley fitted with places for hoisting rope<br>
fixing points differing in diameter. It is also possi-<br>
ble to use more than two tensioning pulleys if it is<br>
desirable e.g. to vary the diameter ratio between the<br>
pulleys by only varying the diameter of the tensioning<br>
pulleys. Moreover, the compensating device 1315 used<br>
may consist of a different type of compensator, such<br>
as e.g. a lever, a different compensating sheave ap-<br>
plication or some other appropriate compensating<br>
sheave application.<br>
In Fig. 13, the passage of the hoisting ropes is as<br>
follows: One end of the hoisting ropes is fixed to the<br>
one of the pulleys of the compensating device 1315<br>
which has a smaller diameter, this pulley being im-<br>
movably fitted on the pulley having a larger diameter,<br>
to which pulley the other end of the hoisting ropes<br>
13 03 is secured. The compensating device 1315 is fit-<br>
ted in place on the elevator car. From the compensat-<br>
ing device 1315, the hoisting ropes 1303 go upwards<br>
and meet a diverting pulley 1314 mounted in the upper<br>
part of the shaft above the elevator car, passing<br>
around it along the rope grooves 1314 of the diverting<br>
pulley. These rope grooves may coated or uncoated, and<br>
the coating used consists of e.g. a friction increas-<br>
ing material, such as polyurethane or some other mate-<br>
rial suited to the purpose. From diverting pulley<br>
1314, the ropes go downwards to a diverting pulley<br>
1313 fitted in place on the elevator car, and having<br>
passed around this pulley the ropes to further upwards<br>
to a diverting pulley fitted in place in the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft. Having passed around di-<br>
verting pulley 1312, the ropes return downwards to a<br>
diverting pulley 1311 fitted in place on the elevator<br>
car, pass around it and go again upwards to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 1310 fitted in place in the upper part of<br>
the elevator shaft. Having passed around this pulley,<br>
the hoisting ropes 1303 go further downwards to a di-<br>
verting pulley 1309 fitted in place on the elevator<br>
car, and having passed around it the ropes 1303 go<br>
further upwards, in tangential contact with a divert-<br>
ing pulley 1307, to the traction sheave 1305. Divert-<br>
ing pulley 1307 is preferably fitted near the hoisting<br>
machine 1304. The roping presented in the figure be-<br>
tween the diverting pulley 1307 and the traction<br>
sheave 1305 of the hoisting machine 1304 is a DW (Dou-<br>
ble Wrap) roping arrangement, wherein the hoisting<br>
rope 1303 runs in tangential contact with the divert-<br>
ing pulley 1307 upwards to the traction sheave 1305<br>
and, having passed around the traction sheave 1305,<br>
returns to the diverting pulley 1307, and having<br>
passed around this pulley the hoisting ropes return to<br>
the traction sheave 13 05. Diverting pulleys<br>
1314,1313,1312,1311,1310,1309,1307 together with the<br>
hoisting machine and the compensating device 1315 form<br>
the suspension above the elevator car with the same<br>
suspension ratio as in the suspension below the eleva-<br>
tor car, the suspension ratio in Fig. 13 being 7:1.<br>
From the traction sheave 1305, the ropes run further<br>
in tangential contact with diverting pulley 1307 to a<br>
diverting pulley 1308 preferably fitted in place in<br>
the lower part of the elevator shaft. Having passed<br>
around diverting pulley 1308, the hoisting ropes 13 03<br>
go upwards again to a diverting pulley 1316 fitted in<br>
place on the elevator car, pass around it and continue<br>
downwards to a diverting pulley 1317 in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft, and having passed around it the<br>
ropes return to a diverting pulley 1318 fitted in<br>
place on the elevator car. Having passed around di-<br>
verting pulley 1318, the hoisting ropes 1303 go down-<br>
wards to a diverting pulley 1319 fitted in place in<br>
the lower part of the elevator shaft, pass around it<br>
and go again upwards to a diverting pulley 1320 on the<br>
elevator car. Having passed around delivery pipe 1320,<br>
the hoisting ropes 1303 continue downwards to a di-<br>
verting pulley 1321 fitted in place in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft, pass around it and go upwards<br>
again to the compensating device 1315 fitted in place<br>
on the elevator car, the other end of the hoisting<br>
ropes being secured to the compensator pulley of lar-<br>
ger diameter. Diverting pulleys<br>
1308,1316,1317,1318,1319,1320, 1321 and the compensat-<br>
ing device 1315 form the hoisting rope suspension be-<br>
low the elevator car. The hoisting machine 1304 and<br>
traction sheave 1305 of the elevator and/or the di-<br>
verting pulleys 1307,1310,1312,1314 placed in the up-<br>
per part of the shaft may be mounted in place on the<br>
frame structure formed by the guide rails 1302 or on<br>
beam structure located at the top end of the elevator<br>
shaft or they may be mounted separately in the eleva-<br>
tor shaft or in some other appropriate mounting ar-<br>
rangement. The diverting pulleys in the lower part of<br>
the elevator shaft may be mounted in place on the<br>
frame structure formed by the guide rails 1302 or on a<br>
beam structure located in the lower part of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft or they may be mounted separately in the<br>
lower part of the elevator shaft or in some other ap-<br>
propriate mounting arrangement. The diverting pulleys<br>
on the elevator car may be mounted in place on the<br>
frame structure on the elevator car 1301 or on a beam<br>
structure or beams structures comprised in the eleva-<br>
tor car or they may be mounted separately on the ele-<br>
vator car or in some other appropriate mounting ar-<br>
rangement .<br>
A preferred embodiment of the elevator of the inven-<br>
tion is an elevator with machine above without machine<br>
room, the drive machine of which comprises a coated<br>
traction sheave and which uses thin hoisting ropes of<br>
substantially round cross-section. The contact angle<br>
between the hoisting ropes of the elevator and the<br>
traction sheave is larger than 180°. The elevator com-<br>
prises a unit comprising a mounting base with a drive<br>
machine, a traction sheave and a diverting pulley<br>
ready fitted on it, said diverting pulley being fitted<br>
at a correct angle relative to the traction sheave.<br>
The unit is secured to the elevator guide rails. The<br>
elevator is implemented without counterweight with a<br>
9:1 suspension ratio so that the elevator ropes run in<br>
the space between one of the walls of the elevator car<br>
and the wall of the elevator shaft.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the elevator of the<br>
invention is an elevator without counterweight with a<br>
suspension ratio of 10:1 above and below the elevator<br>
car. This embodiment is implemented using conventional<br>
hoisting ropes preferably of a diameter of 8 mm and a<br>
traction sheave made of cast iron at least in the area<br>
of the rope grooves. The traction sheave has undercut<br>
rope grooves and its angle of contact to the traction<br>
sheave has been fitted by means of a diverting pulley<br>
to be 180° or greater. When conventional 8-mm ropes<br>
are used, the traction sheave diameter is preferably<br>
340 mm. The diverting pulleys used are large rope<br>
sheaves which, in the case of conventional 8-mm hoist-<br>
ing ropes, have a diameter of 320, 330, 340 mm or even<br>
more.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that<br>
different embodiments of the invention are not limited<br>
to the examples described above, but that they may be<br>
varied within the scope of the following claims. For<br>
instance, the number of times the hoisting ropes are<br>
passed between the upper part of the elevator shaft<br>
and the elevator car and between the diverting pulleys<br>
in the lower part and the elevator car is not a very<br>
decisive question as regards the basic advantages of<br>
the invention, although it is possible to achieve some<br>
additional advantages by using multiple rope passages.<br>
In general, applications are so implemented that the<br>
ropes go to the elevator car from above as many times<br>
as from below, the suspension ratios of the diverting<br>
pulleys going upwards and those the diverting pulleys<br>
going downwards thus being the same. It is also obvi-<br>
ous that the hoisting ropes need not necessarily be<br>
passed under the car. In accordance with the examples<br>
described above, the skilled person can vary the em-<br>
bodiment of the invention, while the traction sheaves<br>
and rope sheaves, instead of being coated metal<br>
sheaves, may also be uncoated metal sheaves or un-<br>
coated sheaves made of some other material suited to<br>
the purpose.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the metallic traction sheaves and rope sheaves<br>
used in the invention, which are coated with a non-<br>
metallic material at least in the area of their<br>
grooves, may be implemented using a coating material<br>
consisting of e.g. rubber, polyurethane or some other<br>
material suited to the purpose.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator car and the machine unit may be laid<br>
out in the cross-section of the elevator shaft in a<br>
manner differing from the lay-out described in the ex-<br>
amples. Such a different lay-out might be e.g. one in<br>
which the machine is located behind the car as seen<br>
from the shaft door and the ropes are passed under the<br>
car diagonally relative to the bottom of the car.<br>
Passing the ropes under the car in a diagonal or oth-<br>
erwise oblique direction relative to the form of the<br>
bottom provides an advantage when the suspension of<br>
the car on the ropes is to be made symmetrical rela-<br>
tive to the center of gravity of the elevator in other<br>
types of suspension lay-out as well.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the equipment required for the supply of power to<br>
the motor and the equipment needed for elevator con-<br>
trol can be placed elsewhere than in connection with<br>
the machine unit, e.g. in a separate instrument panel.<br>
It is also possible to fit pieces of equipment needed<br>
for control into separate units which can then be dis-<br>
posed in different places in the elevator shaft and/or<br>
in other parts of the building. It is likewise obvious<br>
to the skilled person that an elevator applying the<br>
invention may be equipped differently from the exam-<br>
ples described above. It is further obvious to the<br>
skilled person that the suspension solutions according<br>
to the invention can also be implemented using almost<br>
any type of flexible hoisting means as hoisting ropes,<br>
e.g. flexible rope of one or more strands, flat belt,<br>
cogged belt, trapezoidal belt or some other type of<br>
belt applicable to the purpose.<br>
It is also obvious to the skilled person that, instead<br>
of using ropes with a filler as illustrated in Fig. 5a<br>
and 5b, the invention may be implemented using ropes<br>
without filler, which are either lubricated or unlu-<br>
bricated. In addition, it is also obvious to the per-<br>
son skilled in the art that the ropes may be twisted<br>
in many different ways.<br>
It is also obvious to the skilled person that the av-<br>
erage of the wire thicknesses may be understood as re-<br>
ferring to a statistical, geometrical or arithmetical<br>
mean value. To determine a statistical average, the<br>
standard deviation or Gauss distribution can be used.<br>
It is further obvious that the wire thicknesses in the<br>
rope may vary, e.g. even by a factor of 3 or more.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator of the invention can be implemented<br>
using different roping arrangements for increasing the<br>
contact angle a between the traction sheave and the di-<br>
verting pulley/diverting pulleys than those described<br>
as examples. For example, it is possible to dispose the<br>
diverting pulley/diverting pulleys, the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting ropes in other ways than in the roping<br>
arrangements described in the examples. It is also ob-<br>
vious to the skilled person that in the elevator of the<br>
invention the elevator can also be provided with a<br>
counterweight, in which elevator for example the coun-<br>
terweight preferably has a weight below that of the car<br>
and is suspended with separate roping.<br>
