[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of the Invention] EGR SYSTEM<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an EGR system to be incorporated in an internal combustion engine.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
There have been internal combustion engines incorporating an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system for partly returning the exhaust gas to a combustion chamber. In Patent Document 1, for example, an internal combustion engine is disclosed which, having a simple configuration, can increase the pressure and temperature in its combustion chamber to achieve an improved EGR effect.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the internal combustion engine disclosed in Patent Document 1, the exhaust gas exhausted through an exhaust port is accumulated in a gas reservoir and the accumulated exhaust gas is returned to a combustion chamber, for example, during a compression stroke. Namely, in the compression stroke, an EGR valve disposed at an EGR port opens causing the gas reservoir and the combustion chamber to be communicated with each other and the exhaust gas accumulated in the gas reservoir to be introduced into the combustion chamber. The exhaust gas introduced into the combustion chamber is burned together with an air-fuel mixture.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
Internal combustion engines in which the exhaust gas is burned again are advantageous over those incorporating no  EGR system in that the gas exhausted from the former contains less NOx than the gas exhausted from the latter. [0005]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2000-282867 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0006]<br>
Internal combustion engines like the one described above is preferred to have a configuration in which the combustion speed does not drop even when the exhaust gas is returned to the combustion chamber with the engine operating at a remarkably low load (idling, for example). The configuration is also desired to be capable of preventing knocking even when a maximum amount of air is introduced into the combustion chamber. [0007]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an EGR system which can address the above problems. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0008]<br>
To address the above problems, the present invention provides an EGR system to be incorporated in an internal combustion engine having an intake valve disposed at an intake port for introducing air into a combustion chamber and an exhaust valve disposed at an exhaust port for<br><br>
exhausting exhaust gas generated from combustion in the combustion chamber, the EGR system including:<br>
a gas reservoir which collects the exhaust gas,<br>
an EGR valve disposed at an EGR port for returning the exhaust gas from the gas reservoir to the combustion chamber,<br>
control means which determines a load condition of the internal combustion engine, and<br>
an EGR valve open-close control mechanism which, based on a command from the control means having determined the load condition, puts the EGR valve in a state in which the EGR valve can be repeatedly opened and closed to repeatedly shut off and permit communication between the gas reservoir and the combustion chamber or in another state in which the EGR valve is closed to keep the gas reservoir and the combustion chamber isolated from each other. [0009]<br>
According to the invention, the EGR valve is put in an openable-closable state or in a closed (inactive) state depending on the load condition of the internal combustion engine. When the EGR valve in an openable-closable state is opened, the exhaust gas is introduced into the combustion chamber to be burned again. When, on the other hand, the EGR valve is in an inactive state, the exhaust gas is not introduced into the combustion chamber. Therefore, putting the EGR valve in an inactive state when the internal combustion engine is operating at a remarkably low or<br><br>
remarkably high load prevents the exhaust gas from being introduced into the combustion chamber, so that the combustion speed can be prevented from dropping. Furthermore, the internal combustion engine may be prevented from knocking. [0010]<br>
The EGR valve can be made switchable between an openable-closable state and an inactive state just by installing an EGR valve open-close control means without complicating the configuration of the internal combustion engine. The cost of the internal combustion engine can therefore be prevented from sharply increasing. [0011]<br>
The EGR valve open-close control mechanism may include: for example, an EGR cam abutting on a camshaft which opens and closes the intake valve and the exhaust valve;<br>
drive means including a rotary part which is externally and displaceably fitted to the camshaft to be rotatable integrally with the camshaft and which has an abutting part capable of abutting on an abutted part of t EGR cam and a non-rotary part which does not rotate, and<br>
a displacement mechanism which, by displacing the drive means along an axial direction of the camshaft, makes the abutting part and the abutted part abut on each other or leave each other. [0012]<br>
When the EGR valve open-close control mechanism<br><br>
configured as described above is used, the camshaft need not be internally provided with, for example, a rod for switching the EGR valve between an openable-closable state and an inactive state. Increasing the camshaft diameter can therefore be avoided. This eventually makes it possible to avoid making the EGR system and, hence, the internal combustion engine as a whole larger and heavier. [0013]<br>
The displacement mechanism may include holder means which holds the non-rotary part of the drive means and an actuator which displaces the holder means along the axial direction of the camshaft. [Effect of the Invention] [0014]<br>
According to the invention, an EGR valve open-close control mechanism is incorporated in an internal combustion engine, and an EGR valve is switched, according to the load condition of the internal combustion engine, between an openable-closable state and an inactive state under the control of the EGR valve open-close control mechanism. It is therefore possible to put, depending on the load condition, the EGR valve in an inactive state not to return the exhaust gas to the combustion chamber. [0015]<br>
Putting the EGR valve in an inactive state when the internal combustion engine is operating at a remarkably low or remarkably high load may improve the combustion speed of the internal combustion engine while also making it<br><br>
possible to prevent knocking of the engine. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0016]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention relating to an EGR system to be incorporated in an internal combustion engine will be described in detail below with reference to attached drawings. [0017]<br>
Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view schematically showing an essential part of an internal combustion engine 12 incorporating an EGR system 10 according to an embodiment of the invention. Figs. 2 and 3 are cross-sectional views in the directions of arrows II-II and III-III, respectively, in Fig. 1. The internal combustion engine 12 is mounted, for example, on a vehicle like a motorcycle and drives the vehicle by burning an air-fuel mixture. [0018]<br>
The internal combustion engine 12 includes a block body 16 provided with a cylinder 14, a cylinder head 18 linked to an upper portion of the block body 16, and a head cover 20 covering a top portion of the cylinder head 18 for protection. [0019]<br>
A piston 22 is inserted in the cylinder 14. The piston 22 is linked to a crankshaft via a connecting rod (neither is shown). A combustion chamber 24 is made up of a space bounded by the top face of the piston 22 and the<br><br>
cylinder head 18. [0020]<br>
In the cylinder head 18, as shown in Fig. 2, an intake port 26 communicated with an intake manifold (not shown) for introducing air into the combustion chamber 24 and an exhaust port 28 communicated with an exhaust manifold (not shown) for exhausting the exhaust gas from the combustion chamber 24 are formed. The intake port 26 is provided with an intake valve 30. The exhaust port 28 is provided with an exhaust valve 32. [0021]<br>
The intake valve 30 and exhaust valve 32 are opened and closed by a camshaft 38 via rocker arms 34 and 36, respectively. To be more concrete, the camshaft 38 is mounted with cams 40 and 42. When, while the cams 40 and 42 are rotated by the camshaft 38, a peak 40a or 42a of the cam 40 or 42 reaches a predetermined position, the peak 40a or 42a pushes one end of the rocker arm 34 or 36 causing the rocker arm 34 or 36 to turn about an approximately middle portion thereof. As a result, a pushing member 44 or 46 provided at the other end the rocker arm 34 or 36 pushes the intake valve 30 or exhaust valve 32 forcing the intake valve 30 or exhaust valve 32 to be displaced into the combustion chamber 24. [0022]<br>
The intake valve 30 has valve springs 48 and 50 disposed around it. One end of each of the springs 48 and 50 is seated against a disk member 52 fixed in position in<br><br>
the cylinder head 18. The other end of each of the springs 48 and 50 is seated against a spring receiver 54 externally fitted to an end portion of the intake valve 30. When the rotation of the camshaft 38 causes the peak 40a of the cam 40 to leave the one end of the rocker arm 34, the valve springs 48 and 50 pushes the spring receiver 54 by their spring forces. As a result, the intake valve 30 is restored in its initial position to be seated at the intake port 26. [0023]<br>
Similarly, the exhaust valve 32 has valve springs 56 and 58 disposed around it. One end of each of the springs 56 and 58 is seated against a disk member 60. The other end of each of the springs 56 and 58 is seated against a spring receiver 62 externally fitted to an end portion of the exhaust valve 32. When the rotation of the camshaft 38 causes the peak 42a of the cam 42 to leave the one end of the rocker arm 36, the valve springs 56 and 58 push the spring receiver 62 by their spring forces. As a result, the exhaust valve 32 is restored in its initial position to be seated at the exhaust port 28. [0024]<br>
A cam sprocket 64 is linked to one end of the camshaft 38 (see Fig. 1). The camshaft 38 rotates when a cam chain 66 wound around the cam sprocket 64 is driven. [0025]<br>
An EGR port 68 (see Fig. 3) is formed to the right of the intake port 26. A gas reservoir 70 where the exhaust gas is collected is communicated with the EGR port 68. An<br><br>
EGR valve 72 is seated at or leaves the EGR port 68. [0026]<br>
Like the intake valve 30 and exhaust valve 32, the EGR valve 72 has a valve spring 74 disposed around it (see Fig. 3). One end of the valve spring 74 is seated against a disk member 76 fixed in position in the cylinder head 18. The other end of the valve spring 74 is seated against a spring receiver 78 externally fitted to an end portion of the EGR valve 72. [0027]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the camshaft 38 is provided also with an EGR cam 80 for opening and closing the EGR valve 72. The EGR cam 80 can rotate independently of the camshaft 38. Namely, the force to rotate the EGR cam 80 is transmitted not from the camshaft 38 but only from a drive assembly 82 used as drive means. [0028]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the EGR cam 80 is approximately annularly shaped. An annular groove 84 is circumferentially formed on the inner circumferential wall of the ERG cam 80. A first cam portion 86 is bulgingly formed on the outer circumference of the ERG cam 80. Also on the outer circumference, a second cam portion 88 bulging approximately similarly to the first cam portion 86 is formed to be apart from the first cam portion 86 by a predetermined angle (for example, by a crank angle of 180°). A first convex portion 90 is projectingly formed on one bottom face of the EGR cam 80 as   a contacted part, the<br><br>
first convex portion 90 coming between the first cam<br>
portion 8 6 and the second cam portion 88.<br>
[0029]<br>
The camshaft 38 is provided with a positioning pin 92 which enters the annular groove 84 formed on the inner circumferential wall of the EGR cam 80 (see Fig. 1). This configuration prevents the EGR cam 80 from being displaced in the axial direction of the camshaft 38. [0030]<br>
One end of a rocker arm 98 contacts the EGR cam 80. The other end of the rocker arm 98 is provided with a pushing member 100 which is in contact with an upper end portion of the EGR valve 72. [0031]<br>
The camshaft 38 is further provided with the drive assembly 82. The drive assembly 82 includes an inner race member 102 and an outer race member 104 which are each shaped like a disk. A bearing 106 (see Fig. 1) is interposed between the inner race member 102 and the outer race member 104. [0032]<br>
Teeth 108 are formed on the inner circumferential wall of the inner race member 102 (see Figs. 1, 3, and 4). The teeth 108 engage teeth 110 formed on an outer circumferential wall portion near one end of the camshaft 38. When the camshaft 38 rotates, therefore, the inner race member 102 rotates together with the camshaft 38. Thus, the inner race member 102 is a rotary part.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
A second convex portion 112 is projectingly formed as a contacting part on the bottom face facing the EGR cam 80 of the inner race member 102 (see Figs. 1 and 4) . As being described later, the EGR cam 80 rotates when the first convex portion 90 abutting on the second convex portion 112 is pushed by the second convex portion 112. [0034]<br>
Since, as described above, the bearing 106 (see Fig. 1) is interposed between the inner race member 102 and the outer race member 104, the rotation of the inner race member 102 does not cause the outer race member 104 to rotate. In other words, the outer race member 104 is a non¬rotary part. [0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the outer circumferential wall of the outer race member 104 is held by a first holder arm 114 and a second holder arm 116 which are used as holding parts. The first and second holder arms 114 and 116 each have a curved portion 118 formed such that the first and second holder arms 114 and 116 are kept apart from each other. The drive assembly 82 is accommodated between the curved portions 118. The curved portions 118 are each provided with a through-hole for inserting a screw. Screws 120 are inserted through the through-holes and screwed to the outer race member 104 thereby linking the outer race member 104 and the first and second holder arms 114 and 116. [0036]<br><br>
The first and second holder arms 114 and 116 each have a linear portion 122 inserted through an approximately middle portion in the axial direction of a pivot 124. As shown in Fig. 2, the pivot 124 is supported in the cylinder head 18. [0037]<br>
A square end portion 126 included in each of the first and second holder arms 114 and 116 has a U-shaped cutout. A latch shaft 132 which latches a rod 130 making up an actuator solenoid 128 is disposed through the U-shaped cutouts. The first and second holder arms 114 and 116 (holding parts) and the solenoid 128 make up a displacement mechanism for displacing the drive assembly 82 in the axial direction of the camshaft 38. [0038]<br>
The displacement mechanism, the EGR cam 80 (see Figs. 1, 3, and 4), and the drive assembly 82 operate to set the EGR valve 72 in an openable-closable state or in an inactive state. Namely, the displacement mechanism, the EGR cam 80, and the drive assembly 82 function as EGR valve open-close control means. [0039]<br>
The solenoid 128 is electrically connected to control means (not shown), for example, a CPU via a cable 134 for transmitting control signals. A throttle opening sensor for detecting the opening of a throttle valve installed in the intake manifold (not shown) and a rotation sensor for detecting the rotation speed of the internal combustion<br><br>
engine 12 are also electrically connected to the CPU. [0040]<br>
The international combustion engine 12 incorporating the EGR system 10 according to the present embodiment is configured basically as described above. Operations and effects of the international combustion engine 12 will be described below. [0041]<br>
When the internal combustion engine 12 is driven, the cam chain 66 and the cam sprocket 64 operate to rotate the camshaft 38 causing the cams 40 and 42 to also rotate. When the peak 42a of the cam 42 reaches a predetermined position, an end portion of the rocker arm 36 pushes the exhaust valve 32 via the pushing member 46. This causes the valve springs 56 and 58 to be compressed and the exhaust valve 32 to leave the exhaust port 28. That is, the exhaust port 28 is communicated with the combustion chamber 24 causing the exhaust gas generated in the combustion chamber to be collected in the gas reservoir 70. [0042]<br>
As the camshaft 38 further rotates causing the peak 42a of the cam 42 to leave the end portion of the rocker arm 36, the valve springs 56 and 58 are released from their compressed state by their spring forces and cause the exhaust valve 32 to be seated back on the exhaust port 28. As a result, the communication between the exhaust port 28 and the combustion chamber 24 is shut off. [0043]<br><br>
The peak 40a of the cam 40, on the other hand, reaches a position where it pushes an end portion of the rocker arm 34. As a result, the valve springs -4 8 and 50 are compressed and the intake valve 30 leaves the intake port 26. That is, the intake port 26 and the combustion chamber 24 are communicated with each other and air is introduced into the combustion chamber 24 through the intake port 26. [0044]<br>
As the camshaft 38 further rotates causing the peak 40a of the cam 40 to leave the end portion of the rocker arm 34, the valve springs 48 and 50 are released from their compressed state by their spring forces and cause the intake valve 30 to be seated back on the intake port 26. As a result, the communication between the intake port 26 and the combustion chamber 24 is shut off. [0045]<br>
During the above process, the inner race member 102 of the drive assembly 82 also rotates following the rotation of the camshaft 38 with the teeth 108 of the inner race member 102 engaged with the teeth 110 of the camshaft 38. [0046]<br>
During the above process, when the CPU determines, based on electrical information received from, for example, the throttle opening sensor and the rotation sensor, that the internal combustion engine 12 is in an intermediate speed range or in a partial throttle range, it issues a command to the solenoid 128 to put the internal combustion<br><br>
engine 12 in the state shown in Fig. 1. [0047]<br>
In the state shown in Fig. 1, the first convex portion 90 of the EGR cam 80 and the second convex portion 112 of the drive assembly 82 abut on each other. As described above, with the inner race member 102 of the drive assembly 82 rotating, the first convex portion 90 of the EGR cam 80 is pushed by the second convex portion 112 of the inner race member 102 causing the EGR cam 80 to rotate. [0048]<br>
With the EGR cam 80 rotating, when its first cam portion 86 or second cam portion 88 reaches a predetermined position, the first cam portion 86 or second cam portion 88 pushes and turns the rocker arm 98, causing an end portion of the rocker arm 98 to push the EGR valve 72 via the pushing member 100. As a result, the valve spring 74 is compressed and the EGR valve 72 leaves the EGR port 68 to be displaced into the combustion chamber 24, so that the combustion chamber 24 and the gas reservoir 70 are communicated with each other. This causes the exhaust gas collected in the gas reservoir 70 to be introduced into the combustion chamber 24.   The exhaust gas is subjected to combustion together with the air and fuel introduced, through the intake port 26, into the combustion chamber 24 in the subsequent intake stroke. [0049]<br>
When the first cam portion 86 or second cam portion<br><br>
88 leaves the rocker arm 98, the valve spring 74 is released from its compressed state by its spring force. As a result, the EGR valve 72 is restored to be seated at the EGR port 68. [0050]<br>
As described above, while the first convex portion 90 and the second convex portion 112 are abutting on each other, the EGR valve 72 repeats opening and closing. [0051]<br>
When the internal combustion engine 12 is idling with the throttle valve open to a minimum degree or when it is operating at a maximum load with the throttle valve open to a maximum degree, the CPU determines, based on electrical information received from, for example, the throttle opening sensor and the rotation sensor, that the internal combustion engine 12 is in a low-load range or in a high-load range. In such a case, it is not particularly necessary to open the EGR valve 72 and return the exhaust gas to the combustion chamber 24. [0052]<br>
The CPU, therefore, transmits a control signal to the solenoid 128 via a cable 134 to have the rod 130 advanced. As a result, the rod 130 advances as shown in Fig. 5. [0053]<br>
As the rod 130 advances, the first and second holder arms 114 and 116 each having the square end portion 126 that is linked to the rod 130 via the latch shaft 132 turn about the pivot 124.<br><br>
[0054]<br>
Since, as described above, the first and second holder arms 114 and 116 are linked to the outer race member 104 via the screws 120, respectively, the outer race member 104 and, hence, the whole of the drive assembly 82 retreats rightward, as seen in Fig. 5, along the axial direction of the camshaft 38. At this time, the drive assembly 82 is guided by the teeth 110 of the camshaft 38 with the teeth 110 engaged with the teeth 108 of the inner race member 102. [0055]<br>
As the drive assembly 82 retreats, the second convex portion 112 of the inner race member 102 leaves the first convex portion 90 of the EGR cam 80, so that the force to rotate the EGR cam 80 is no longer transmitted to the EGR cam 80. This eventually causes the EGR cam 80 to stop rotating. Hence, the first and second cam portions 86 and 88 of the EGR cam 80 no longer abut on the rocker arm 98, and the EGR valve 72 is no longer pushed by the rocker arm 98 via the pushing member 100. Namely, the EGR valve 72 stays seated at the EGR port 68, that is, the EGR valve 72 stays closed, so that the combustion chamber 24 and the gas reservoir 70 stay shut off from each other. Thus, with the EGR valve 72 left inactive, the exhaust gas is not returned to the combustion chamber 24. [0056]<br>
The camshaft 38, on the other hand, continues rotating, so that the inner race member 102 included in the drive assembly 82 also continues rotating. Since, as<br><br>
described above, no rotating force is transmitted from the camshaft 38 to the EGR cam 80, the EGR cam 80 does not rotate. The positioning pin 92 provided on the camshaft 38 is displaced in the annular groove 84, so that it does not serve to transmit a rotating force to the EGR cam 80. [0057]<br>
A positioning screw is inserted in the annular groove 84, so that the EGR cam 80 can be prevented from being displaced in the axial direction of the camshaft 38. Namely, positional shifting of the EGR cam 80 can be prevented. [0058]<br>
When, subsequently, the throttle valve opening is changed and the load on the internal combustion engine 12 enters an intermediate speed range or a partial throttle range, the CPU detects the change and issues a command to the solenoid 128 via the cable 134 to have the rod 130 moved back. The control signal causes the rod 130 to retreat and the first and second holder arms 114 and 116 linked to the rod 130 via the latch shaft 132 turn about the pivot 124. Eventually, as shown in Fig. 1, the second convex portion 112 of the inner race member 102 and the first convex portion 90 of the EGR cam 80 are allowed to abut on each other, so that the inner race member 102 is enabled to transmit its rotating force to the EGR cam 80. Hence, the EGR valve 72 becomes openable and closable and, when it opens, the exhaust gas is returned to the combustion chamber 24. [0059]<br><br>
As described above, the present embodiment using a simple configuration wherein merely the drive assembly 82 having a portion which abuts on or leaves the EGR cam 80 is incorporated in the internal combustion engine 12 makes it possible to switch, depending on the load condition of the internal combustion engine 12, the EGR valve 72 very easily between a state in which it is openable and closable and another state in which it is left closed (inactive state). [0060]<br>
According to the above embodiment, putting the EGR valve 72 in an inactive state, for example, when the internal combustion engine 12 is operating at a remarkably low load or remarkably high load may improve the combustion speed of the internal combustion engine while also making it possible to prevent knocking of the engine. [0061]<br>
Even though, in the above embodiment, the EGR valve opening-closing control means that switches the EGR valve 72 between an openable-closable state and an inactive state is configured with the EGR cam 80, the drive assembly 82, and the drive assembly displacement mechanism, the EGR valve opening-closing control means may have any different configuration as long as it is capable of switching the EGR valve 72 between an openable-closable state and an inactive state. [0062]<br>
The actuator used in the above embodiment may be made up of a cylinder mechanism.<br><br>

[Document Name] Scope of Claims [Claim 1]<br>
An EGR system to be incorporated in an internal combustion engine having an intake valve disposed at an intake port for introducing air into a combustion chamber and an exhaust valve disposed at an exhaust port for exhausting exhaust gas generated from combustion in the combustion chamber, the EGR system comprising:<br>
a gas reservoir which collects the exhaust gas;<br>
an EGR valve disposed at an EGR port for returning the exhaust gas from the gas reservoir to the combustion chamber;<br>
control means which determines a load condition of the internal combustion engine; and<br>
an EGR valve open-close control mechanism which, based on a command from the control means having determined the load condition, puts the EGR valve in a state in which the EGR valve can be repeatedly opened and closed to repeatedly shut off and permit communication between the gas reservoir and the combustion chamber or in another state in which the EGR valve is closed to keep the gas reservoir and the combustion chamber isolated from each other. [Claim 2]<br>
The EGR system according to Claim 1, wherein the EGR valve open-close control mechanism comprises:<br>
an EGR cam abutting on a camshaft which opens and closes the intake valve and the exhaust valve;<br><br>
drive means including a rotary part which is externally and displaceably fitted to the camshaft to be rotatable integrally with the camshaft and which has an abutting part capable of abutting on an abutted part of the EGR cam and a non-rotary part which does not rotate; and<br>
a displacement mechanism which, by displacing the drive means along an axial direction of the camshaft, makes the abutting part and the abutted part abut on each other or leave each other. [Claim 3]<br>
The EGR system according to Claim 2, wherein the displacement mechanism comprises holder means which holds the non-rotary part of the drive means and an actuator which displaces the holder means along the axial direction of the camshaft.<br><br></td>
