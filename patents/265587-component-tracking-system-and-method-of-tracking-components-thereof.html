PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to multiple operations - multiple machines manufacturing setups and more particularly this relates to the tracking / tracing of components in multiple operations - multiple machine manufacturing setups.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In multi machine - multi operation manufacturing set up, as shown in fig. I, it is essential to trace the component by the origin of the machine and time of performing the operation to analyze the production history / quality data of the component.<br>
Conventionally many methods are used to track components in mass production. A combination of technologies like 2D matrix, radio frequency identification device (RFID) tags is used along with a combination of various reading /writing devices and network to track the components. Essentially it calls for networking of machines and equipments to track the component. This requires a large number of reading and writing devices on most of the equipments in the manufacturing line. This amounts to large investments and complicated system.<br>
Large number of machines and long operation sequences requires costly and complicated component tracking system. Also it is required to integrate the control system of various machines to a single central system which also increases the complexity.<br>
The drawbacks associated with conventional tracking system are that the system is very complex in nature and yields to high cost.<br>
Refer to Fig I, it typically show multiple operations multiple-machines manufacturing setup.<br><br><br>
Machines are arranged in form of cells. Operations and cells are numbered as per sequence of operation. Illustration showed in fig. I shown three operations. First operation is termed as Operation (OP 10), second operation is termed as Operation (OP20) &amp; third operation is termed as Operation (OP 30). Individual group of operations is termed as Object (1). Said object (1) forms a cell for operation. All these cells are interconnected by material carrying conveyor termed as Object (5).<br>
Cross gantry (2) is used to transfer the components from conveyor to the machines. Component is picked from conveyor by gantry head and dropped on the machine. Every component is picked up from the component pick up point. Gantry head shuttles between components pick up point to all machines in the cell.<br>
Gantry (2) movement is controlled by Gantry Controller (3). Machine controllers give signal to gantry controller for loading the fresh component after finishing earlier component. The Gantry controller loads the component on a machine as per the sequence of completion of process by the machine.<br>
Reading devices (4) are mounted on each of the machines in cell. This is communication device to read unique identification code written on component.<br>
Central Server (6) is interfaced with all said reading devices (4) and machines. Component tracking information from readers (4) and machine controller is collected in the computer.<br>
Above mentioned are standard components of any multi machine-multiple operation set up. Conventional component tracking system will use readers on each machine, and transfer this unique identification code to server. Component tacking information can be retrieved from sever. The drawback associated with the conventional component tracking system is that said system is complex in nature as it requires huge network in manufacturing set up.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a component tracking system with minimum complexity by using least number of reading and writing devices.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a component tracking system which is easy to maintenance.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a component tracking system which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Component tracking system comprises of at least one machine cell, one or more gantries, gantry controller /s, material handling system, component reader/s, central server, wherein operation wise said machine cells are interconnected by material handling system, said gantry is interfaced to gantry controller and machine controller, said component reader/s is mounted on said material handling system and is interfaced to gantry controller, all said gantry controllers are interfaced with central server.<br>
