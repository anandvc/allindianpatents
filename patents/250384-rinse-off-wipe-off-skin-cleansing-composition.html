				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cleansing composition comprising a fatty ester in combination with a lipid. The composition provides skin cleansing and hydration benefits.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Personal cleansing products, especially products for cleansing facial skin, are very popular consumer products in today's market. There are several cleansing benefits that such facial cleansing products attempt to achieve, such as removing makeup, removing dead skin, unclogging pores, sebum removal, and the like. While many facial cleansing products are effective in providing these cleansing benefits, many products can irritate the skin or cause the skin to lose moisture and become dried out. Even water alone, when used to cleanse skin, can cause the skin to lose moisture.<br>
As a result, many consumers resort to using both a facial cleansing product, for achieving cleansing benefits, followed by a skin lotion product to provide hydration benefits to the skin and prevent the skin from drying out.<br>
There thus remains a desire to develop skin cleansing compositions, especially for facial cleansing, that provide effective skin cleansing while improving skin hydration, provide a rich creamy lather, and are easily rinsed from the skin with water or wiped from the skin with a dry or damp substrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cleansing skin which also provide skin hydration benefits. The compositions generally comprise a fatty ester in combination with a lipid to provide both cleansing and hydration benefits in a rinse-off or wipe-off cleansing composition. The methods of the present invention generally encompass contacting the skin with a composition of the present invention and either rinsing the composition from the skin with water or wiping the composition from the skin with a dry or damp substrate.<br>
In one embodiment, the present compositions comprise at least 8%, by weight of the composition, of fatty ester to provide skin cleansing and hydration benefits, especially for removing greasy soils from skin (e.g. makeup) in the context of a rinse-off or wipe-off composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the present compositions comprise a nonionic surfactant to allow the compositions to be easily rinsed or otherwise removed from the skin. The nonionic surfactant will preferably have an average HLB of from about 8 to about 20. These compositions tend to be highly aqueous and will comprise a level of alcohol solvent, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or mixtures thereof, of less than about .50%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the present compositions further comprise a hydrophobia structuring agent. The hydrophobic structuring agent can facilitate the formation of a gel network in the present compositions, which tends to provide a rich, creamy feel on the skin and allows for good application of the product without causing damage to the skin. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of cleansing skin and cleansing compositions comprising a fatty ester in combination with a lipid, preferably a high modulus lipid. The compositions can further comprise a number of optional ingredients, such as hydrophobic structuring agents, cationic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, anionic surfactants, humectants, exfoliating agents, polymeric thickeners, silicones, silicone elastomers, aqueous carrier, and other optional ingredients, and mixtures thereof. FATTY ESTERS<br>
Fatty esters are incorporated in the present compositions to provide skin cleansing and skin hydration benefits. Fatty esters can also serve to enhance the spreadability of the lipid and to reduce the tack typically associated with lipids. The fatty esters can be premixed with the lipids, or they can be added separately while the product is warm, or when the product is cooling.<br>
The present compositions will typically comprise fatty esters at a level of at least about 1%, preferably at least about 5%, and more preferably at least about 8%, by weight of the composition. The level of fatty ester in the present composition is preferably no<br>
greater than about 40%, preferably no greater than about 30%, and more preferably no greater than about 20%, by weight of the composition. In one embodiment, the present compositions comprise greater than 8%, and preferably greater than about 10%, by weight of the composition, of fatty ester.<br>
The fatty esters of the present invention can include linear and branched fatty ester oils that comprise one or two ester group in the molecule. One type of common fatty ester oil useful in the present invention are the fatty acid mono and polyesters such as cetyl octanoate, octyl isonanoanate, myristyl lactate, cetyl lactate, isopropyl myristate, myristyl myristate, diisopropyl sebacate, isopropyl isostearate, isostearyl isostearate, propylene glycol dipelargonate, 2-ethylhexyl isononoate, 2-ethylhexyl stearate, isopropyl lanolate, 2-ethylhexyl salicylate, diisotearyl malate, isostearyl neopentanoate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl adipate, butyl stearate, ethylhexyl isononanoate, decyl oleate, cholesterol isostearate, glycerol monostearate, glycerol distearate, glycerol tristearate, alkyl lactate, alkyl citrate and alkyl tartrate; sorbitol ester, and the like. Preferred fatty esters are isopropyl palmitate and/or isopropyl isostearate.<br>

The individual fatty groups of the esters will preferably comprise no more than about 22 carbon atoms, more preferably no more than about 18 carbon atoms, and more preferably no more than about 16 carbon atoms. For a single alkyl group having greater than 17 carbon atoms, branched or unsaturated alkyl chains are preferred. Preferably, the total number of carbon atoms in the fatty ester will be less than about 30, even more preferably less than about 25, even more preferably less than about 23. LIPIDS<br>
The present compositions will further comprise a lipid to provide skin hydration benefits. Suitable lipids include oils and high modulus lipids. The high modulus lipids of the present invention typically comprise an oil and an oil structurant. Compositions having enhanced skin cleansing and skin hydration benefits can be achieved by combining the lipid with the fatty ester of the present invention. As noted previously, the lipids can be premixed with the fatty esters during the process of making the present compositions.<br>
Lipids are typically incorporated in the present compositions at levels of from about 0.1% to about 20%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, and more preferably from about 1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition. Preferably, the ratio of lipid to fatty ester will typically be no more than about 20:1, more preferably no more than about 10:1, more preferably no more than about 5:1, and more preferably no more than about 2:1. Preferably, the ratio of lipid to fatty ester will typically be at least about 1:15, even more preferably at least about 1:10, even more preferably at least about 1:8, even more preferably at least about 1:4.<br>
A variety of oils are suitable for incorporation as a lipid in the compositions herein. One class of oils useful herein are triglycerides and modified triglycerides. These include vegetable oils such as jojoba, soybean, canola, sunflower, safflower, rice bran, avocado, almond, olive, sesame, persic, castor, coconut, and mink oils. Synthetic triglycerides can also be employed. Modified triglycerides include materials such as ethoxylated and maleated triglyceride derivatives provided they are liquids. Proprietary ester blends such as those sold by Finetex as FINSOLV® are also suitable, as is ethylhexanoic acid glyceride.<br>
Another type of oil is liquid polyester formed from the reaction of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol. Examples of polyesters suitable for the present invention are the polyesters marketed by ExxonMobil under the trade name PURESYN® ESTER.<br>
A second class of oils suitable for the present invention is liquid and semi-solid hydrocarbons. These include linear and branched oils such as liquid paraffin, squalene, squalane, mineral oil, low viscosity synthetic hydrocarbons such as polyalphaolefm sold by ExxonMobil under the trade name of PURESYN® PAO and polybutene under the trade name PANALANE® or INDOPOL®. Light (low viscosity) highly branched hydrocarbon oils are also suitable.<br>
The lipid of the present invention can be a high modulus lipid that comprises an oil, such as those described previously, and an oil structurant. A variety of oil structurants are suitable for incorporation in the high modulus lipid of the present invention. The oil structurant can be either an organic or inorganic structurant. Examples of organic oil structurants suitable for the invention can be selected from the group consisting of natural or modified fats, fatty acid, fatty amine, natural and synthetic waxes, block copolymers,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Suitable block polymers for this application can be those sold under the name KRATON® by Shell. Inorganic structuring agents can be selected from the group consisting of hydrophobically modified silica, hydrophobically modified clay and mixtures thereof. Non-limiting examples of inorganic structurants are BENTONE® 27V, BENTONE® 38V or BENTONE® GEL MIO V from Rheox; and CAB-O-SIL® TS720 or CAB-O-SIL® M5 from Cabot Corporation,<br>
The structurant may be a natural or synthetic crystalline wax. Mineral, animal or plant (vegetable) waxes are all described as natural waxes. Synthetic waxes are described as those waxes that have been synthetically polymerized from raw materials or chemically modified natural waxes.<br>
Among the natural crystalline waxes which may be used are petroleum-based waxes such as paraffin wax and microcrystalline wax. Molecular weights of paraffin waxes generally range from about 360 to about 420 (about 26 to about 30 carbon atoms), although versions with longer chains (molecular weights up to about 600) are available. Typical melting points are from about 126°F to about 134°F (from about 52°C to about 57°C), with the high molecular weight versions having melting points near about 170°F (about 77°C). Paraffin waxes are brittle and the addition of oil tends to weaken the structure (lowers the tensile strength). Microcrystalline wax melting points are from about 145°F to about 195°F (from about 63°C to about 91°C). The crystals of microcrystalline wax tend to be small and irregular and consist of several types: plates, malcrystalline and needle.<br>
Other suitable oil structurants include animal-derived or plant-derived waxes. Animal waxes can be obtained from such things as bees, insects or whales. These waxes include but are not limited to beeswax, Chinese wax, shellac wax, spermaceti and wool wax. Plant waxes can be derived from beans, leaves and berries. Plant or vegetable waxes can include bayberry, candelilla, carnauba, cotton, esparto, fir, Japan, ouricury, palm, rice-oil, sugar cane, ucuhuba and cocoa butter.<br>
Among synthetic crystalline waxes which may be used are crystalline polymers such as polyethylene, Fischer-Tropsch waxes such as polymethylene, chemically modified waxes, polymerized alpha olefins and synthetic animal waxes. For example, siliconyl beeswax may be used which is beeswax that has been chemically modified.<br>
In addition, the oil structural may be a natural or synthetic hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils can be hydrogenated vegetable oils, hydrogenated coconut oil, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, hydrogenated rapeseed oil, castorwax and many others.<br>
Petrolatum is a unique hydrocarbon material as it typically comprises both an oil (e.g. mineral oil) and an oil structurant (e.g. paraffin wax and/or microcrystalline wax). Therefore, petrolatum itself constitutes a high modulus lipid according to the present invention and is a preferred high modulus lipid of the present invention. Petrolatum can also be blended with other lipids of the present invention. Its semi-solid nature can be controlled both in production and by the formulator through blending with other lipids.<br>
The high modulus lipids of the present invention will typically have a Lipid Modulus Value of at least about 50, preferably at least about 100, more preferably at least about 125, and more preferably at least about 150. The Lipid Modulus Value of a lipid material is measured according to the Lipid Modulus Test Method described herein. AQUEOUS PHASE HYDROPHOBIC STRUCTURING AGENTS<br>

These structuring agents can be useful to assist in the formation of the Theological characteristic of the composition which can contribute to the stability of the composition of the present invention. In particular, the aqueous phase hydrophobic structuring agents tend to assist in the formation of the liquid<br>
crystalline gel network structures in the present compositions. Indeed, the present compositions preferably comprise a gel network. The "gel network" of the present invention typically comprises an aqueous phase hydrophobic structuring agent and a surfactant. A gel network in the present compositions tends to provide a rich creamy feel and to allow good application of the product without causing damage to the skin.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the oil phase particles contain only a small number of HMIPs per oil particles. Preferably this is less than 20, more preferably less than 10, most preferably less than 5. These parameters, the relative<br>
size of the oil droplets to the HMIP and the approximate number of HMIP particles per dispersed oil particles, can be determined by using visual inspection with light microscopy.<br>

The interference color is a function of the thickness of thin film, the thickness for a specific color may be different for different materials. For TiO2, a layer of 40nm to 60nm or a whole number multiple thereof gives silver color, 60nm to 80nm yellow color, 80nm to l00nm red color, l00nm to 130nm blue color, 130nm to 160nm green color. In addition to the interference color, other transparent absorption pigments can be precipitated on top of or simultaneously with the TiO2 layer.

The present invention also relates to methods of cleansing the skin, wherein the method comprises contacting the skin with a composition of the present invention and rinsing the skin with water or wiping the skin with a substrate, to remove at least a portion of the composition from the skin.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are also useful for cleansing and/or hydrating skin, especially for cleansing of the face and neck areas.

If desired, the area to be cleansed can be premoistened with water. It has been found that the compositions of the present invention can be combined with water during the cleansing process and rinsed-off from the skin. Alternatively, the composition can be used alone and wiped-off from the skin using a pad, cotton ball, tissue, or other like device or substrate. The cleansing process is typically a two-step process involving application of the composition followed either by rinsing of the product with water or wiping without the use of water. Generally, an effective amount of composition to be used will depend upon the needs and usage habits of the individual. LIPID MODULUS TEST METHOD<br>
Lipid rheology is first measured on a TA Instruments AR2000 stress-controlled rheometer with a Peltier temperature controlled sample stage or an equivalent. A parallel plate geometry is used with a 40mm plate and a 1mm gap. The lower plate is heated to 85°C and the melted lipid and structurant (if present) is added onto the lower plate and allowed to equilibrate. The upper plate is then lowered to the 1mm gap while ensuring the lipid fills the gap fully, spinning the top plate and adding more lipid to promote<br>
wicking, and the sample is cooled quickly to 25°C and equilibrated at 25°C for 5 minutes. Viscosity is then measured using a stress-ramp procedure common on these types of machines using a logarithmic stress ramp from 20 to 2500Pa for a 2-minute duration, with 60 measurements points per decade. The starting and ending stress is sufficient to induce flow and reach a shear rate of at least 10 sec-1. Viscosity is recorded and the data fitted to a power law model using Equation 1. Only points between 0.001 sec-1 and 40 seconds-1 are to be used in the power law fit. The viscosity at 1.0 sec-1 is calculated from Equation 1. One should carefully watch the sample during the test so that when the material is ejected from under the plate, the method is stopped. Equation 1:<br>
Where η= viscosity, K is the consistency and y (dot) is the shear rate and n is the shear index.<br>
The Lipid Modulus Test utilizes the data collected from the Lipid Rheology Test. In this case, the data is plotted as stress (Pa) vs. %Strain. The Modulus is obtained by recording the value at 200% strain (using visual extrapolation if there is not a data point at 200% strain) and dividing this value by 2 (200% strain is a strain of 2) to obtain the lipid modulus. In general, five samples are run and the high and low values are discarded and the middle three values are averaged to obtain a Lipid Modulus Value.<br>
