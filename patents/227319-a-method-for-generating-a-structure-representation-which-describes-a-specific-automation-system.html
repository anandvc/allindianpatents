				<td>Description<br>
Method for generating a structure representation which<br>
describes a specific automation system<br>
To control or monitor automated processes, what are known as<br>
automation systems are normally used today. The automated<br>
processes may be process-engineering processes, automated<br>
production methods or else generation and distribution systems<br>
for electrical power, for example. An automation system<br>
normally comprises field transmitters which are connected to<br>
the automated process, which are arranged in proximity to the<br>
process and which use suitable sensors, such as current and<br>
voltage converters, flow meters or concentration measuring<br>
instruments, to obtain particular measured data from the<br>
process (e.g. currents, voltages, mass flows, concentrations).<br>
On the basis of these measured data, the process can be<br>
monitored and controlled. By way of example, the measured data<br>
can be forwarded to suitable output devices, such as screen<br>
displays, and can be shown there, for example in the form of<br>
graphics or tables, to the operating personnel for the<br>
respective process. If the field transmitters are what are<br>
known as electrical protective devices then the captured<br>
measured data are normally checked automatically for observance<br>
of particular operating parameters and, if the prescribed<br>
operating parameters are not observed, a suitable protective<br>
measure is automatically taken, such as opening a circuit<br>
breaker in an electrical power distribution system.<br>
Normally such automation systems are controlled by data<br>
processing devices which can use<br><br>
a suitable piece of control software to perform all the steps<br>
required for control and monitoring. To this end, such a data<br>
processing device and the relevant control software need to be<br>
matched, inter alia, precisely to the structure or design of<br>
the respective specific automation system for the relevant<br>
process which has to be automated. Such matching is today<br>
usually carried out in the actual programming stage of the<br>
relevant control software for the data processing device in a<br>
respective specific automation system, which means that the<br>
programmers and developers of this control software actually<br>
need to know the design of the specific automation system at<br>
the time of programming.<br>
By way of example, German laid-open specification DE 100 53 665<br>
Al discloses a process control system or an automation system<br>
for remotely monitoring and controlling process-engineering<br>
processes. In the case of the process control system known from<br>
the laid-open specification, the measured data are displayed<br>
and the process control system is operated using a process<br>
display which is stored to a central location in the data<br>
processing device and which contains the specific structure of<br>
the automation system for the relevant process. This process<br>
display has been created manually and stored at the central<br>
location in the data processing device before the automation<br>
system is actually started up. In the event of any changes to<br>
the automation system, this process display also needs to be<br>
matched accordingly.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method<br>
which provides a comparatively simple way of<br><br>
producing a piece of control software for a data processing<br>
device in a specific automation system.<br>
The invention achieves this object by means of a method for<br>
generating a structure representation which describes a<br>
specific automation system from a model structure<br>
representation which describes a general automation system,<br>
where the model structure representation has a structured<br>
representation of functional groups in the general automation<br>
system and their links to one another, and each functional<br>
group can be assigned one or more components of the specific<br>
automation system, and where the following steps are performed:<br>
a text file reproducing the model structure representation<br>
is provided for a data processing device which controls<br>
the specific automation system;<br>
those components of the specific automation system which<br>
can be jointly assigned to a functional group in the model<br>
structure representation are ascertained by the data<br>
processing device, and<br>
the ascertained components are entered into the model<br>
structure representation to generate the structure<br>
representation which describes the specific automation<br>
system.<br>
The fundamental advantage of the inventive method is that the<br>
software for the data processing device which controls the<br>
specific automation system does not need to be manually matched<br>
individually to the specific automation system. The reason for<br>
this is that the inventive method involves only a model<br>
structure representation which describes a general automation<br>
system being provided in the software at the time of<br>
programming, said model structure representation being<br>
automatically matched to the specific<br><br>
automation system only when the automation system is started<br>
up.<br>
In other words, a general piece of control software is provided<br>
containing a model which applies to the design of various<br>
automation systems and which, when a specific system is started<br>
up, is independently - that is to say without any manual<br>
settings - matched to the design or structure thereof.<br>
Another advantage of the inventive method is that this allows<br>
the creation of a general piece of control software which can<br>
be matched to a multiplicity of different automation systems.<br>
There is thus no separate creation of a respective piece of<br>
control software for every single instance of various<br>
automation systems.<br>
In one advantageous development of the inventive method,<br>
instructions contained in the text file prompt the data<br>
processing device to check only selected functional groups to<br>
determine whether a plurality of components of the specific<br>
automation system can be jointly assigned to this functional<br>
group. In this way, the model structure representation can be<br>
matched to the structure representation of the specific<br>
automation system particularly quickly and efficiently, since<br>
it is actually possible to stipulate in advance those<br>
functional groups for which a plurality of components of the<br>
automation system can be assigned in the first place. There is<br>
thus no checking of the other functional groups by the data<br>
processing device.<br><br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the inventive method, the<br>
data processing device ascertains those components of the<br>
specific automation system which can be jointly assigned to a<br>
functional group in the model structure representation by<br>
sending an electronic query to the respective components or to<br>
a common control device which is superordinate to them, and the<br>
respective components or the common control device which is<br>
superordinate to them respond(s) to this electronic query by<br>
sending an electronic response to the data processing device<br>
with an identification key which is respectively unique for<br>
them. In this way, the plurality of components which can be<br>
assigned to a common functional group can be identified<br>
particularly easily, since the data processing device can do<br>
this merely by asking the multiple instances of components for<br>
their unique identification keys. The respective unique<br>
identification key can be used to distinguish each component of<br>
the specific automation system clearly from all other<br>
components. Identification keys within this context may be slot<br>
numbers, unique addresses, component identification numbers,<br>
component names arising once within the specific automation<br>
system and product or serial numbers for individual components,<br>
for example.<br>
In this context, the electronic query within the scope of the<br>
invention may also be sent to a common control device - usually<br>
a software module - which is superordinate to the respective<br>
components of the specific automation system and which controls<br>
the response from the respective identification key if more<br>
than one component can be assigned to the relevant functional<br>
group.<br><br>
In this connection, it is also considered to be advantageous if<br>
components of the specific automation system which can each be<br>
jointly assigned to a functional group in the model structure<br>
representation use identification keys of the same type when<br>
sending the electronic response. In this way, the relevant<br>
components can be distinguished particularly easily, since<br>
although all the components of the specific automation system<br>
which can be assigned to a functional group have different<br>
values of identification keys, they generally use the same type<br>
of identification key. By way of example, in this context the<br>
identification key used is a slot number which can be used for<br>
identifying the respective components clearly from their<br>
different identification key values, that is to say in this<br>
case different slot numbers.<br>
In addition, it is considered to be an advantageous development<br>
of the inventive method if the respective components<br>
additionally send further data characterizing them with the<br>
electronic response. In the case of this development, specific<br>
further information about the relevant components of the<br>
automation system can advantageously be picked up by the data<br>
processing device when the specific automation system is<br>
actually started up. Examples of such further information may<br>
be a more precise description of the relevant component, its<br>
respective status (on, off, fault) or, by way of example, the<br>
formats of the data which this component needs to send to the<br>
data processing device and receive while the automation system<br>
is operating.<br><br>
It is considered to be a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
inventive method that even a functional group which can be<br>
assigned a single component has this component ascertained and<br>
entered into the model structure representation to complete the<br>
structure representation which describes the specific<br>
automation system. In this way, the full automation system with<br>
all the components can be identified and entered into the<br>
structure representation actually within the startup described<br>
above. In line with this development, components which are the<br>
only ones to be able to be assigned to a particular functional<br>
group in the model structure representation are thus also<br>
additionally identified and entered into the model structure<br>
representation.<br>
Particularly advantageously, the respective components of the<br>
specific automation system can be addressed and identified by<br>
the data processing device if the respective components of the<br>
specific automation system are addressed by the data processing<br>
device using a component path which contains at least one<br>
identification for the respective component. In this context, a<br>
component path can be constructed in similar fashion to file,<br>
directory or device paths which are known from operating<br>
systems for home and office computers.<br>
It is also considered to be advantageous if the data processing<br>
device ascertains information which is typical of a component<br>
of a functional group or which is common to a plurality of<br>
components of a functional group by generating a type path<br>
which indicates the relevant functional group from the relevant<br>
component path, and the data processing device uses this type<br>
path<br><br>
to read the information for the relevant functional group from<br>
the text file. In this way, it is merely possible to use the<br>
component path corresponding to a respective component to<br>
ascertain information which is typical of this component from<br>
the relevant functional group following conversion into a type<br>
path. Such information may be, by way of example, the type of<br>
components which can be assigned to this functional group, and<br>
formats for the data which are to be interchanged with these<br>
components.<br>
A type path indicating the relevant functional group can be<br>
generated by the data processing device particularly easily if<br>
the data processing device generates the type path from the<br>
component path by removing the at least one identification for<br>
the respective component from the component path to form the<br>
type path.<br>
In this connection, it is also regarded as being particularly<br>
advantageous that the component path and the type path are<br>
formulated using the language XPath. The language XPath is a<br>
language for navigation and addressing particularly in XML<br>
documents which has been normalized by the international<br>
standardization committee W3C. More detailed information on<br>
XPath can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath.<br>
Furthermore, in another advantageous embodiment of the<br>
inventive method, the structure representation which describes<br>
the specific automation system is converted into a graphical<br>
representation by the data processing device. Such a graphical<br>
representation can be used by an operator of the automation<br>
system to<br><br>
obtain a fast and comprehensive overview of the full automation<br>
system.<br>
It is regarded as particularly advantageous in this connection<br>
if the graphical representation based on the structure<br>
representation is displayed using a user device which belongs<br>
to the data processing device. In this context, an operator of<br>
the automation system can particularly advantageously obtain an<br>
overview of the precise design of the specific automation<br>
system, for example using a user device connected to a central<br>
computer in the data processing device, such as a control<br>
station or a laptop.<br>
In this context, it may also be advantageous if the structure<br>
representation is converted into the graphical representation,<br>
and displayed, using a browser device on the user device. In<br>
this way, a user device can obtain access to the graphical<br>
representation of the structure of the specific automation<br>
system particularly easily in an Internet-based automation<br>
system, for example, because a browser device can be used for<br>
access which is largely independent of hardware and operating<br>
system.<br>
It is also regarded as particularly advantageous that XML is<br>
used for the text file reproducing the model structure<br>
representation. The XML (Extended Markup Language) format is<br>
particularly well suited to describing hierarchically<br>
structured systems. For this reason, it can also be used with<br>
particular advantage to represent a normally hierarchically<br>
structured design for an automation system. The XML format is<br>
also system-independent, that is to say can<br><br>
be edited data processing devices with various operating<br>
systems using different programming languages.<br>
To explain the inventive method in more detail,<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of an automation<br>
system in a block diagram,<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of a structure<br>
representation which describes a specific automation<br>
system,<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment of a model structure<br>
representation which describes a general automation<br>
system, and<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of a user display for<br>
operating an automation system.<br>
Figure 1 uses a type of block diagram to show one possible<br>
design for an automation system 1 by way of example. An<br>
automated process (not shown in figure 1) involves field<br>
transmitters 2A to 2D, which are connected to the automated<br>
process via sensors and/or converters (likewise not shown in<br>
figure 1) . The process may be a process-engineering process or<br>
an automated production process, for example. In the text<br>
below, however, it will be assumed that the process is a power<br>
supply system, for<br><br>
example a power supply mains. In this case, the field<br>
transmitters connected to the power supply system are control<br>
appliances or electrical protective appliances for monitoring<br>
and for protecting the power supply mains, for example. The<br>
field transmitters 2A to 2D deliver measured data from the<br>
process, for example voltage and current measurements, to a<br>
data processing device 4 via a bus system 3 . In line with<br>
figure 1, the data processing device 4, which is set up to<br>
control the automation system 1, comprises a central computer 5<br>
and user devices 6A to 6D, which communicate with the central<br>
computer 5 by means of various options. For example, the user<br>
device 6A, which may be a local control station, for example,<br>
is hardwired directly to the central computer 5. The user<br>
devices 6B and 6C, e.g. office or control room computers, are<br>
connected to the central computer 5 via a network 7, for<br>
example the Internet or an Intranet, and the user device 6D,<br>
e.g. a laptop, is wirelessly connected to the central computer<br>
5 by means of combined transmission and reception devices 8A<br>
and 8B.<br>
Figure 2 uses a tree structure to show an exemplary embodiment<br>
of a design for a (specific) automation system of this type<br>
with a plurality of components. In this context, a central<br>
processor unit (CPU) 20, which may be held in the central<br>
computer 5 shown in figure 1, for example, first of all<br>
controls an integral driver device 21 which is used to regulate<br>
the communication between the CPU 2 0 and the remaining<br>
components of the automation system, for example. The integral<br>
driver 21 can also retrieve an information block 22. By way of<br>
example, information contained in the information block 22 can<br>
contain a version number and a production<br><br>
date for the integral driver 21. In line with figure 2, the<br>
integral driver 21 in turn controls four "single drivers" 23A<br>
to 23D, which in turn have particular appliances 24A to 24E<br>
subordinate to them. It can be seen that the fourth single<br>
driver 23B at this location has two associated appliances 24D<br>
and 24E. In a subsequent structure plane, the appliances 24A to<br>
24E finally have subordinate sensors 25A to 25F which are<br>
connected to the process.<br>
It is also possible to see in figure 2 that most components of<br>
the specific automation system shown in figure 1 correspond to<br>
particular blocks in the structure representation shown in<br>
figure 2. In this context, some blocks in figure 2 represent<br>
clear components of the specific automation system, for example<br>
appliances 24A to 24E and sensors 25A to 25F. Others represent<br>
software components, for example single drivers 23A to 23D or<br>
the integral driver 21. The information block 22 has no actual<br>
depiction in the specific automation system and in this context<br>
serves merely to give a structure to data and information<br>
within the structure representation and hence serves to provide<br>
them with better clarity. Said software components and the<br>
information block 22 will normally be produced on the data<br>
processing device 4 (cf. figure 1), which is indicated in<br>
figure 2 by a dashed frame.<br>
For the automation system to operate, it is necessary for there<br>
to be such a structure representation of the specific<br>
automation system with its relevant components for a piece of<br>
control software for the data processing device 4 shown in<br>
figure 1. In line with the invention, such a<br><br>
structure representation is obtained from a model structure<br>
representation, as shown in figure 3, for example.<br>
Figure 3 shows such a model structure representation by way of<br>
example, said model structure representation being able to be<br>
applied generally to a large number of automation systems. In<br>
this context, instead of individual components of a specific<br>
automation system the figure shows only their functional<br>
groups, that is to say classes of components in a fictitious<br>
automation system, so to speak. This is identified in the<br>
illustration shown in figure 3 by the abbreviation "FG" in the<br>
top left-hand corner of each individual block. In line with<br>
figure 3, the topmost structure plane holds a functional group<br>
(FG) CPU 31 which is superordinate to an FG "integral driver"<br>
32. The FG "integral driver" 32 is in turn superordinate to<br>
functional groups "single driver" 33 and "information" 34 which<br>
are arranged parallel to one another. Finally, the FG "single<br>
driver" 3 3 has a subordinate FG "appliance" 3 5 and the latter<br>
has a subordinate FG "sensor" 36. A model structure<br>
representation of this type can be used generally to describe<br>
the design of a multiplicity of automation systems.<br>
To generate a structure representation of a specific automation<br>
system from the model structure representation shown in figure<br>
3, for example in a similar manner to figure 2, it is necessary<br>
to ascertain the true number of components which can be<br>
assigned to the respective functional groups, particularly at<br>
the locations indicated by asterisks 37 in figure 3. By way of<br>
example, the functional group "single driver" can be assigned a<br>
plurality of single driver components in a specific automation<br>
system. In addition, the individual components of the specific<br>
automation system need to be entered into the<br><br>
model structure representation, in order to obtain a<br>
corresponding structure representation therefrom.<br>
The procedure which is to be applied for this purpose will be<br>
described in more detail below:<br>
To match a piece of control software to a specific automation<br>
system, a model structure representation, for example as shown<br>
in figure 3, is first of all required in the form of a text<br>
file. Such a text file can be created particularly conveniently<br>
in XML (Extended Markup Language) format, since XML can be used<br>
particularly well for describing hierarchically structured<br>
systems. An example of such a text file in a shortened XML<br>
version is indicated below:<br>
1	<cpu><br>
2	<integral driver><br>
3	<information><br>
4	<driver number type="int"></driver><br>
5	<date of creation type="string"></date><br>
6	</information><br>
7	<single driver resolvecardinalities="true" key="Driver&lt;br/&gt;
No. "><br>
8	<status type="string"></status><br>
9	<designation type="string"></designation><br>
10	<appliance resolvecardinalities="true" key="Appliance&lt;br/&gt;
No."><br>
11	<status type="string"></status><br>
12	designation type = "string"/&gt;<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
21 <sensor resolve cardinalities="true" key="Sensor No."><br>
:<br><br>
31	</sensor><br>
32	</appliance><br>
33	</single><br>
34	</integral><br>
35	</cpu><br><br>
Such a text file can be used to describe the model structure<br>
representation shown in figure 3. By way of example, the text<br>
file shows the individual functional groups "CPU", "Integral<br>
driver", "Information" etc., which have further associated data<br>
when required. By way of example, the functional group<br>
"Information" may contain data indicating a driver number or a<br>
date of creation. This is indicated in lines 4 and 5 of the<br>
text file shown. In addition, the respective data type used is<br>
also indicated, for example the data type "integer" (int) is<br>
used for the driver number, and the date of creation is in the<br>
"string" type. In line 7 the text file also shows the<br>
instruction "ResolveCardinalities = true", which means that at<br>
this location in the functional group "Single driver" it would<br>
be possible to assign not just a single component but rather a<br>
plurality of single driver components of the specific<br>
automation system jointly. To distinguish between the<br>
individual single driver components of the specific automation<br>
system, the expression Key = "Driver No." is used to stipulate<br>
the addressing number, for example, of a single driver<br>
component as a unique identification key. The same applies to<br>
the functional groups "Appliance" and "Sensor" with the<br>
identification keys appliance number (appliance No.) and sensor<br>
number (sensor No.).<br>
A text file in such or similar a form needs to be made<br>
available to the data processing device which controls the<br>
specific automation system. By way of example, it is<br>
transmitted to the data processing device after it has been<br>
created on a programming workstation. However, one particular<br>
advantage in the use of such a model structure representation<br>
is that a single model structure representation in the form of<br>
a text file can be copied a plurality of times and can be used<br>
for a plurality of<br><br>
automation systems. The development and programming involvement<br>
in advance is thus significantly reduced.<br>
The data processing device in the specific automation system<br>
then needs to be used to convert the model structure<br>
representation into a structure representation which is matched<br>
to the specific automation system. To this end, the data<br>
processing device checks the text file for instructions such as<br>
"ResolveCardinalities = true", for example, in order to<br>
ascertain those locations at which there may be a plurality of<br>
components which can be assigned to a functional group. At<br>
these locations, the data processing device requests the<br>
relevant components in the specific automation system, for<br>
example by virtue of the data processing device transmitting an<br>
electronic query containing the respective type of an<br>
identification key which has been sought for the specific<br>
functional group. This electronic query is respectively<br>
answered by the components which can be assigned to this<br>
functional group by virtue of them sending their identification<br>
key, e.g. their appliance number, to the data processing device<br>
as an electronic response.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible for all or some similar<br>
components of the specific automation system to have a super-<br>
ordinate common control device which receives the electronic<br>
query and coordinates the responses of the respective<br>
components to the data processing device.<br>
Together with the identification key, it is also possible to<br>
send further data characterizing the respective component, for<br>
example, such as a more accurate designation for the component<br>
or the status of the component (e.g. on, off,<br><br>
fault). The data processing device enters the returned<br>
components into the text file using their identification keys<br>
and checks the further structure planes of the text file in<br>
similar fashion.<br>
At all locations at which there are instructions to check the<br>
specific automation system for a plurality of components which<br>
can be jointly assigned to a functional group, the data<br>
processing device carries out the method which has just been<br>
described. In this way, all components of the automation system<br>
which can be jointly assigned to a respective functional group<br>
are incorporated into the text file, so that ultimately a<br>
structure representation of the specific automation system,<br>
likewise in text form, is produced, as indicated again in<br>
shortened version and in XML format below by way of example:<br>
1	<cpu><br>
2	<integral driver><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
11 <single driver key="Driver No." no.="100"><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
21 <appliance key="Appliance No." appliance no.="1"><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
31 <sensor key="Sensor No." sensor no.="1001"><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
41	</sensor><br>
42	<sensor key no. sensor><br><br>
:<br>
51	</sensor><br>
52	</appliance><br>
53	<appliance key="Appliance No. Appliance No. = "><br><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
61 </appliance><br></single><br>
:<br>
:<br>
:<br>
71	</integral><br>
72	</cpu><br>
From the structure representation shown for the specific<br>
automation system in text format, it can be seen that<br>
individual components, such as a single driver with the driver<br>
number 100, are entered below the functional group "Integral<br>
driver", for example. The single driver with driver No. 100 has<br>
subordinate appliances with the appliance numbers (appliance<br>
No.) 1 and 2 in the structure representation shown. Further<br>
appliances may be listed in a similar manner. The appliance<br>
with appliance No. 1 in turn has subordinate sensors with the<br>
sensor numbers 1001 and 1002. The structure explained<br>
corresponds to the left-hand branch of the tree structure of<br>
the specific automation system with the first single driver<br>
23A, and the first appliance 24A and the sensors 25A and 25B<br>
which is shown in figure 2, for example. The other branches of<br>
the structure representation shown in figure 2 can be<br>
transferred to the structure representation in text format in<br>
similar fashion.<br>
In addition to the respective identification keys, such as<br>
driver numbers, product numbers and sensor numbers, of the<br>
individual identified components, it is also possible for<br>
further data describing the components to be incorporated into<br>
the structure representation. Thus, by way of example, this may<br>
contain information indicating a status for the respective<br>
component and a more accurate designation for the component.<br><br>
In addition to such components as can be jointly assigned to a<br>
functional group in the model structure representation, the<br>
other components of the specific automation system can also be<br>
entered into the model structure representation in the same<br>
cycle to form a complemented structure representation of the<br>
specific automation system. In the case of these components,<br>
precisely one component is therefore assigned to precisely one<br>
functional group. In the case of figures 2 and 3, this applies<br>
to the CPU 20 and the functional group "CPU" 31, for example.<br>
These other components can be detected in similar fashion to<br>
the procedure described with an electronic query from the data<br>
processing device and a corresponding electronic response from<br>
the respective component, where, by way of example, a value for<br>
an identification key for the respective component is<br>
transmitted to the data processing device and is entered into<br>
the model structure representation. In similar fashion to the<br>
method described above, it is possible, in this case too, to<br>
send further data identifying the respective component in<br>
addition to the identification keys. In this way, a full<br>
structure representation of the specific automation system with<br>
all the available components is finally obtained from the model<br>
structure representation.<br>
To designate a component of the specific automation system and<br>
possibly to request information or measured data from the<br>
latter or to transmit it to the latter, the data processing<br>
device needs to use unique addressing for the respective<br>
component. In this context, it is appropriate to use what are<br>
known as component paths - or else entity paths - in which, in<br>
similar fashion to the form which is used by known office and<br>
home computer operating systems, the respective components are<br>
listed separated by<br><br>
oblique strokes. It is important that to address a specific<br>
component of the specific automation system the respective<br>
identification keys which are unique for the sought component<br>
also need to be incorporated into the component or entity path<br>
in addition.<br>
The text below shows an example of a component path for<br>
addressing the first appliance 24A (cf. figure 2) and for<br>
requesting its status:<br>
"CPU/Integral driver/Single driver['Driver No. = 100']/<br>
Appliance['Appliance No. = 1']/Status"<br>
Organization and navigation using such paths can be carried out<br>
particularly conveniently using the XPath language normalized<br>
by the standardization committee W3C, for example. Further<br>
information relating to XPath can be retrieved on the Internet<br>
at the URL http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath.<br>
In addition, it may be advantageous not just to address a<br>
specific component using an appropriate component path, but<br>
rather to obtain general information about said component's<br>
respective functional group. This information is contained in<br>
the model structure representation. Information about a<br>
functional group may be "metadata", for example, which indicate<br>
a data type in which data can be received or sent by components<br>
of the specific automation system which are associated with the<br>
respective functional group. When a component path as indicated<br>
above is used, it is a particularly simple matter to generate a<br>
"type path" for retrieving such information about the<br>
individual functional groups. The reason for this is that this<br>
simply requires all parts of the component path<br><br>
which respectively contain the specific identification keys of<br>
components of the specific automation system to be removed; in<br>
the example above, the type path remaining is as follows, for<br>
example:<br>
"CPU/Integral driver/Single driver/Appliance/Status"<br>
This type path can now be used to request general information<br>
about the file format, for example, in which the status of the<br>
individual components associated with the functional group<br>
"Appliances" is output. This indicated type path refers to line<br>
11 of the text file indicated above, for example, in which the<br>
data type indicated for the status of the functional group<br>
"Appliance" is the type "string".<br>
Using the structure representation produced in this manner for<br>
the specific automation system, a user of the automation system<br>
can also access specific components of the automation system<br>
very easily. To this end, a display device or an external<br>
computer with a display device can be connected to the central<br>
computer in the data processing device, for example, and can<br>
allow navigation in the automation system in a browser window,<br>
for example, as shown by way of example in figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 shows a browser window 41 in which, besides other<br>
information, particularly a structure representation of the<br>
specific automation system ("System 1") is shown in a graphical<br>
representation as a structure tree 42 by way of example. Using<br>
such a (graphical) structure representation of the specific<br>
automation system, a user of the automation system can, by way<br>
of example, access the sixth sensor - as indicated by the<br>
structure tree 42 -<br><br>
(cf. 25F in figure 2) and can retrieve particular information,<br>
such as measurements or status values, from the sensor. This<br>
information can then be displayed in a further window 4 3 in the<br>
form of a table, for example. The graphical representation of<br>
such a structure representation describing the specific<br>
automation system can be generated comparatively easily from an<br>
XML file as indicated above. This can be converted either<br>
directly by the central computer of the data processing device<br>
or by the browser device of a user computer connected to the<br>
central computer of the data processing device, for example.<br><br>
