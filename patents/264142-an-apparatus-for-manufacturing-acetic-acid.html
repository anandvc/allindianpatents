				<td>USE OF PREDEHYDRATION TOWERS IN AN ETHANE OXIDATION TO<br>
ACETIC ACID/ETHYLENE PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the process of oxidizing ethane to produce acetic acid. In<br>
particular, this invention relates to a method of oxidizing ethane to acetic acid wherein acetic<br>
acid is recovered from the oxidation reactor product stream using predehydration towers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to acetic.acid and ethylene in the gas phase is<br>
well known in the art. Generally, this process involves reacting a gaseous feed in a fiuidized bed<br>
or in a fixed-bed reactor. The gaseous feed comprises ethane and/or ethylene which are fed to<br>
the reactor as pure gases or in admixture with one or more other gases. Examples of such<br>
additional, or carrier, gases are nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, air and/or<br>
water vapor. The gas comprising molecular oxygen can be air or a gas comprising more or less<br>
molecular oxygen than air, e.g. oxygen. Relatively high oxygen contents are preferred since the<br>
achievable ethane conversion, and thus the yield of acetic acid, is higher. Oxygen or the gas<br>
comprising molecular oxygen is preferably added in a concentration range outside the explosive<br>
limits under the reaction conditions since this makes the process easier to carry out. However, it<br>
is also possible to employ an ethane/ethylene to oxygen ratio within the explosive limits. The<br>
reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 400 to 600 °C, while the pressure can be<br>
atmospheric or superatmospheric, e.g. in the range from 1 to 50 bar.<br>
[0003] Ethane is usually first mixed with the inert gases such as nitrogen or water vapor before<br>
oxygen or the gas comprising molecular oxygen is fed in. The mixed gases are preferably<br>
preheated to the reaction temperature in a preheating zone before the gas mixture is brought into<br>
contact with the catalyst. Acetic acid is usually separated from the gas leaving the reactor by<br>
condensation. The remaining gases are recirculated to the reactor inlet where oxygen or the gas<br>
comprising molecular oxygen and also ethane and/or ethylene are metered in. The recirculated<br>
gases will always comprise both ethylene and ethane.<br>
[0004] Figure 1 shows a common prior art acetic acid production process. In this basic system,<br>
an ethane containing stream (1) is fed along with an oxygen containing gas (2) into an ethane<br>
oxidation reactor (3). This reactor can be either a fiuidized bed fixed-bed reactor. Inside the<br>
reactor (3), ethane is oxidized into acetic acid, ethylene, and various carbon oxides (COX). The<br><br>
gaseous reactor effluent (4) that contains these three primary components is fed into a recycle<br>
gas scrubber (5), which produces a top stream containing ethylene, ethane, and COX. The top<br>
stream (7) from the recycle gas scrubber is routed to a processing step (8) that removes the COX<br>
from the top stream. The purified stream (9) is then recycled to the oxidation reactor (3) for<br>
further conversion into acetic acid. The bottom stream (6) from the recycle gas scrubber (5),<br>
which contains acetic acid, water, and heavy ends by-products, may be purified as known in the<br>
art to provide purified acetic acid. For example, the bottom stream may be routed to a drying<br>
column to remove water followed by a heavy ends column to remove propionic acid and other<br>
heavy components.<br>
[0005] Often times the ethane oxidation reactor effluent will exit the reactor at a high<br>
temperature and contain large quantities of water. Water would ultimately need to be separated<br>
from the process, and as described above, the water is often removed from the process in the<br>
same stream as the acetic acid, and is then subject to further processing to remove the water. It<br>
would therefore be beneficial to develop a process wherein acetic acid can be recovered<br>
separately from the water in the effluent of an ethane oxidation to acetic acid reactor, thereby<br>
eliminating a further water removal step.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] It is an object of this invention to provide a process in which acetic acid is produced by<br>
ethane oxidation. One byproduct of the ethane oxidation, water, is normally removed from the<br>
reactor effluent with the acetic acid. In one object of the invention, the reactor effluent is<br>
processed in a predehydration tower so as to separately recover water, acetic acid, and a gas<br>
stream for recycle back to the ethane oxidation reactor.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] FIGURE I shows a prior art acetic acid production process.<br>
[0008] FIGURE 2 shows one embodiment of the acetic acid production process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present invention provides a process for selectively preparing acetic acid from the<br>
oxidation of ethane. One byproduct of the ethane oxidation reaction is water, and it is an<br><br>
objective of this application to recover dry acetic acid from this process vising predehydration<br>
towers.<br>
[0010] The oxidation of ethane can be carried out in a fluidized bed or in a fixed bed reactor. For<br>
use in a fluidized bed, the catalyst is normally ground to a particle size in the range from 10 to<br>
200 pm or prepared by spray drying.<br>
[0011] The gaseous feedstock, and any recycle gas combined with said feedstock gas, contains<br>
primarily ethane, but may contain some amount of ethylene, and is fed to the reactor as a pure<br>
gas or in a mixture with one or more other gases. Suitable examples of such additional or carrier<br>
gases are nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, air and/or steam. The gas<br>
containing molecular oxygen may be air or a gas which has a higher or lower molecular oxygen<br>
concentration than air, for example pure oxygen. The ethane oxidation reaction is generally<br>
carried out at about 400 to about 600°C, preferably about 450 to about 550°C, the key being that<br>
the temperature be high enough to oxidize ethane. The appropriate temperature will depend<br>
upon the catalyst used in the ethane oxidation reactor. There are a wide range of catalysts for use<br>
in this reaction, and one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to optimize catalyst<br>
performance by finding the appropriate reaction temperature. The pressure can be atmospheric or<br>
superatmospheric, for example about 1 to about 50 bar, preferably about 1 to about 30 bar.<br>
[0012] The oxidation reaction produces a mixture of gases including ethylene, acetic acid, water,<br>
COX (CO and CO2), unreacted ethane, and assorted heavy by-products. This product gas<br>
normally exits the reactor at a temperature between about 450 to about 600°C. The product gas<br>
effluent from the reactor is then preferably filtered to remove catalyst fines and is then routed to<br>
a predehydration tower.<br>
[0013] The reactor effluent enters the base of the predehydration tower, and due to the high<br>
temperature of the stream, provides most, if not all, of the energy necessary to effectuate the<br>
separation of acetic acid from water in the tower. Alternatively, a reboiler at the base of the<br>
predehydration tower could be used to provide additional energy input into the tower. The tower<br>
would operate at or near the pressure of the ethane oxidation reactor, and would preferably<br>
contain 25-35 stages, however the number of stages can vary depending upon the quality of the<br>
separation desired. An overhead condensing system cools the overhead gas stream to a<br>
temperature below the condensation point of the water vapor, preferably about 100-120°C, and<br><br>
would provide reflux to the predehydration tower. An overhead liquid water product is<br>
recovered, this water having very low levels of acetic acid therein, preferably less than 1%,<br>
allowing for that stream to be disposed of biologically. Such disposal methods are known in the<br>
art. The bottoms stream from the predehydration tower is crude acetic acid with much lower<br>
water content, preferably less than 10% water, than had the stream been processed in a<br>
conventional stripper. The gaseous top stream from the predehydration tower is routed to a fixed<br>
bed CO converter followed by a processing step that removes the COX from the top stream. This<br>
purified stream is then recycled to the ethane oxidation reactor for further conversion into acetic<br>
acid.<br>
[0014] One of skill in the art will appreciate that the towers, scrubbers, and routing referred to in<br>
the preceding paragraphs will have associated with them various heat exchangers, pumps, and<br>
connectors and will have operating parameters that are determined by the particular mixture of<br>
gases involved. It is within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art to determine the proper<br>
configurations and parameters, given the above disclosure.<br>
[0015] Figure 2 shows one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the<br>
gaseous ethane feedstock (11) and any recycle gas (24) are fed to the ethane oxidation reactor<br>
(13) as a pure gas or in a mixture with one or more carrier gases described above. An oxygen<br>
containing gas (12) is also fed to the reactor (13). The ethane oxidation reaction temperature is<br>
generally carried out at about 400 to about 600°C, preferably about 450 to about 550°C,<br>
depending on the catalyst used, the key being that the temperature be high enough to oxidize<br>
ethane. The appropriate temperature will depend upon which of the numerous available catalysts<br>
are used in the ethane oxidation reactor. Such a temperature determination is within the skill of<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0016] The oxidation reaction produces a mixture of gases (14) that includes ethylene, acetic<br>
acid, water, COX, unreacted ethane, and assorted heavy by-products. The ethane oxidation<br>
product gas (14) is then introduced into the bottom of a predehydration tower (15). A reboiler<br>
(16) is provided, but may not be necessary depending upon the temperature of the reactor outlet<br>
stream (14), at the base of the predehydration tower to provide additional energy input into the<br>
tower by heating the bottoms stream. The bottoms stream of the predehydration tower,<br>
containing primarily acetic acid, would be heated in the reboiler (16), vaporizing part of the<br><br>
stream for reintroduction in to the predehydration tower (15). The balance of the bottoms<br>
stream, the crude acetic acid stream (17) is removed from the system and sent downstream for<br>
further processing.<br>
[0017] An overhead condensing system (19) cools the overhead gas stream (18), and provides a<br>
liquid reflux (20) to the predehydration tower (15). An overhead liquid water product (21) is<br>
recovered, containing very low levels of acetic acid. This water stream (21) would then be sent<br>
on for further processing, cleanup and/or disposal. The gaseous top stream (22) from the<br>
predehydration tower, containing primarily unreacted ethane, ethylene, and COX gasses, is then<br>
routed to a fixed bed CO converter followed by a processing step that removes the CO* from the<br>
top stream (23). This purified stream (24) is then recycled to the ethane oxidation reactor (13)<br>
for further conversion into acetic acid.<br>
[0018] The preceding description is set forth for purposes of illustration only and is not to be<br>
taken in a limited sense. Various modifications and alterations will be readily apparent to<br>
persons skilled in the art. It is intended, therefore, that the foregoing be considered as exemplary<br>
