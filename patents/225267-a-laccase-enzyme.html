				<td>Novel laccase onzyme and the gene encoding the engyme<br>
A LACCASE ENZYME<br>
The invention relates to new laccase enzymes. The object of the invention is a new laccase<br>
enzyme, an enzyme preparation, and a gene encoding the enzyme in particular. Another<br>
object of the invention is the use of laccase in various applications.<br>
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) belong to blue copper oxidases. According to a definition, laccases<br>
are p-diphenol oxidases. In addition to diphenols, laccases oxidize many other substrates,<br>
such as methoxy substituted phenols and diamines. With respect to their substrates, lac-<br>
cases are amazingly unspecific. Namely because of their broad substrate specificity and, on<br>
the other hand, their ability to oxidize phenolic compounds, laccases have aroused a great<br>
interest in industrial applications. Promising fields of application for laccases include, for<br>
example, delignification and the gluing of fibreboards in the forest industry, dyeing of fabrics<br>
 and detoxification of dye house effluents in the textile industry, as well as use in different<br>
biosensors. With the aid of mediators, i.e., intermediary molecules, laccases also<br>
oxidize substrates that they otherwise would not be able to oxidize. The mediators are<br>
small-molecule compounds that are oxidized by laccases. The oxidized mediator, in turn,<br>
oxidizes the actual substrate.<br>
The first laccase was found as early as 1883 in the Japanese lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera).<br>
Laccases have been found in many plants, such as peach, tomato, mango, and potato;<br>
laccases have also been found in some insects. However, most known laccases originate in<br>
white rot fungi. The following genera, for example, produce laccase: Agaricus, Aspergillus,<br>
Cerrena, Curvularia, Fusarium, Lentinius, Monocillium, Myceliophtora, Neurospora,<br>
Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Pleurotus, Podospora, Schizophyllum, Sporotrichum,<br>
Stagonospora and Trametes. In nature, the functioning of laccases relates to the decomposition<br>
 of lignocellulose, the biosynthesis of cell walls, the browning reactions of fruit and<br>
vegetables, as well as the prevention of microbial attacks on plants, among others.<br>
Many fungal laccases have been isolated and some genes that encode them have been<br>
cloned. For example, Saloheimo et al. (1985) isolated and characterized the laccase gene of<br>
the Phlebia radiata , and Kojima et al. (1990) the laccase genes of the Coriolus hirsutus<br>
from white-rot fungus, and Berka et al. (1997), WO 95/33836, the gene of the Myceliophtora<br>
 thermophila laccase. The natural production levels of laccases are often very low. Efforts<br>
 have been made to improve production by expressing laccase genes in foreign production<br>
 hosts. For example, Saloheimo and Niku-Paavola (1991; WO92/01046) successfully<br>
 produced Phlebia radiata laccase in the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Laccases have<br>
also been produced heterologously, in the Aspergillus oryzae fungus (Yaver et al., 1996,<br>
Berka et al. 1997 and WO 95/33836), and in the Pichia pastoris yeast (Jonsson et al,<br>
1997).<br>
The expression of a laccase originating in the Coprinus genus in the fungus of the Aspergillus<br>
 genus is described in the patent publication WO 97/08325. Similarly, the expression<br>
of the laccase originating in the Polyporus pinsitus species and the laccase originating in<br>
the Scytalidium genus in the fungus of the Aspergillus genus are described in the patent<br>
publications US 5,770,418 and US 5,843,745, respectively.<br>
The temperature and pH properties of laccases isolated from various organisms differ from<br>
each other. They also depend on the substrate used. As the majority of laccases that are<br>
known function best at an acidic pH and a rather low temperature, their properties are not<br>
optimal for the applications. Some thermostable or neutral laccases have been reported but,<br>
generally, the thermostable or neutral laccases are either thermostable or neutral, not both.<br>
For example, Heinzkill et al. (1998) found laccases with an unusually high pH optimum<br>
from the fungi of the Coprinaceae genus. However, in 60 minutes, the activity of all the<br>
laccases that were found decreased to below 30% from the initial level at 60°C. A patent<br>
(WO96/06930) has been applied for the use of these laccases in bleaching textile dyes, but<br>
the application does not mention the activity of these laccases at high temperatures. The<br>
application examples were made at a temperature of 30-35°C. Patent application<br>
WO95/07988 describes a neutral laccase from the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, but the application<br>
 does not study the applicability of this laccase at high temperatures in addition to<br>
alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the patent application WO98/55628 describes a<br>
thermostable laccase from the Trametes versicolor TV-1 strain, but according to the patent,<br>
the activity of this laccase is best at pH 2. The Trametes versicolor TV-1 laccase is not pH<br>
stable either; its residual activity at pH 6 after 60 minutes of incubation is about 60% of the<br>
original. Patent application WO95/33836 describes a neutral Myceliophtora thermophila<br>
laccase that in hair dyeing works at pH 7, but the temperature in the application example<br>
was 30°C. The publication Berka et al. (1997) reports that the Myceliophtora thermophila<br>
laccase retains 100% of its activity at 60°C for 20 minutes and its optimum activity is at pH<br>
6.5.<br>
Patent publications JP8070861 and JP9056378 describe Trametes laccases, which have<br>
been reported to be thermostable and their pH optimum has been reported to be 5.0. In<br>
addition, Diamantidis et al. (2000) have characterized a bacterial laccase from the Azospirillum<br>
 lipoferum bacterium. They reported that the laccase was thermostable for 10 min at<br>
70°C and the pH optimum was 6.0.<br>
The publication Bharathi and Ramalingam (1993) describes the phenoloxidase of a clam,<br>
its maximum activity being at pH 6.8 and more than 50% of its activity remaining when<br>
incubated at 60°C for 10 min. Patent publication EP-A1 -0852260 describes polyphenoloxidases<br>
 from the species of the Myrothecium genus, their pH optimum being 8.5-9 and the<br>
optimum temperature at 60-70°C. It is known that the fungi of the Myrothecium genus produce<br>
 toxins.<br>
When comparing the temperature and the pH optimum values specified for various enzymes,<br>
 it should be noted that the substrate used has an effect on the values. Phenolic substrates,<br>
 such as guaiacol and syringaldazine, provide higher values than non-phenolic substrates,<br>
 such as ABTS.<br>
The following patent publications suggest the use of laccases in wood-processing applications:<br>
 WO 9954545, US 5,691,193, DE 4137761, EP 408803 and WO 9523232.<br>
The purpose of this invention is to eliminate the disadvantages related to prior art and to<br>
provide quite a new kind of enzyme preparation containing laccase activity. Especially, the<br>
enzyme preparation can be used in applications, which need to tolerate both high temperatures<br>
 and a high pH. There are such applications, for example, in the wood-processing industry<br>
 and other processing industries.<br>
The present invention introduces a new laccase that has both better temperature and pH<br>
properties, and especially the thermal stability, than the known laccases in applications that<br>
require a neutral or alkaline pH and a temperature of over 40°C.<br>
To be more precise, the object of the invention is a laccase enzyme specified in claim 1.<br>
The laccase enzyme according to the invention can be isolated from the strains of the<br>
Melanocarpus genus. As far as we know, no laccase isolated from the strains of the Melanocarpus<br>
 genus has been described earlier. The laccase according to the invention can<br>
preferably be isolated from the strains of the M. albomyces species, especially from the IMI<br>
255989 strain, samples of which are freely available from the CABI Bioscience UK centre<br>
CABI GRC strain collection (Egham) (Bakeham Lane Egham SurreyDW20 9Ty, UK).<br>
The strain was deposited in the collection in 1981. In 1996, the strain was also deposited in<br>
the Culture Collection of VTT Biotechnology (Technical Research Centre of Finland VTT,<br>
at the address: VTT Biotekniikka, PL1500, 02044 VTT, Espoo, Finland) and given the<br>
number VTT-D-96490. Samples of this deposition are also freely available. This strain is<br>
described in the publication Ravanko (1996), which studied the laccase activity of the culture<br>
 solution of the strain at various temperatures and pH values. However, the publication<br>
does not describe the isolation and the purification of the laccase. •<br>
The laccase enzyme according to the invention works over the range of pH 3-9, preferably<br>
4-8, more preferably 5-8, even more preferably 6-8, most preferably 6.5-7.5. The laccase<br>
activity is at its highest over the range of pH 7-8, the highest at about 7.5. Thus, the pH optimum<br>
 of the enzyme is quite wide and ranges over pH 5-7.5; preferably the pH optimum is<br>
7.5. The activity of the enzyme is at its highest within 30-80°C, preferably within 40-80°C,<br>
more preferably within 50-80°C, even more preferably within 60-80°C, most preferably<br>
within 60-70°C. The best activity of the enzyme occurs at a temperature of about 70°C.<br>
The laccase according to the invention retains well its activity at high temperatures. In the<br>
conditions described in Example 3, more than 50% of the activity of the laccase of the<br>
culture solution remains after incubating at 60°C for 1 hour. After incubating at 70°C for 15<br>
min, about 30% of the activity of the enzyme remains, and after incubating at 70°C for 30<br>
min, about 10%. At 80°C, the enzyme withstands incubation for about 5 min in the conditions<br>
 described in Example 3. In some applications, e.g., in the forest industry, even a tolerance<br>
 for a short time at high temperatures provides considerable advantages. When<br>
further studying the activity of the pure enzyme, it was discovered that the thermal stability<br>
of the enzyme was exceptionally good and clearly better than that of the laccases<br>
previously described. At 60°C, the enzyme retained its activity essentially unchanged for 2<br>
hours, as indicated by Example 3 and Fig. 7. The thermal stability of the Myceliophtora<br>
laccase characterized by Berka et al. (1997) remained at 60°C for 20 min only.<br>
Furthermore, the pH stability of the laccase enzyme according to the invention improves,<br>
when the pH increases. After 22-hour incubation at pH 4, the residual activity is 65% , the<br>
residual activity in the same conditions at pH 5 is about 80%, the residual activity at pH 6<br>
is about 85%, the residual activity at pH 7 is about 90%, and at pH 8 as much as over 90%,<br>
about 92%. Together with the pH optimum, this property makes it advantageous to use the<br>
enzyme according to the invention at high pH values.<br>
The isoelectric point of the laccase according to the invention is about 4.0 when measured<br>
by isoelectric focusing, whereby the accuracy of the definition is about ±0.5.<br>
When determined by SDS-PAGE, the molecular weight of the laccase according to the invention<br>
 is about 80 kDa. The accuracy of the SDS-PAGE definition is in the order of +1-5<br>
kDa.<br>
The objective of the invention is a laccase in particular, which, when purified, has an isoelectric<br>
 point of about 4.0 as measured by isoelectric focusing, and a molecular weight of<br>
about 80 kDa. The pH optimum of the laccase is about 7.5 and the temperature optimum<br>
about 70°C when measured with a purified enzyme. The laccase can be isolated from the<br>
strains of the Melanocarpus genus, preferably from the strains of the Melanocarpus albomyces<br>
 genus, most preferably from the M. albomyces IMI 25598 strain. Another objective<br>
of the invention is an isolated and purified laccase enzyme.<br>
A further object of the invention is an enzyme preparation containing the laccase enzyme<br>
according to the invention. The amount of laccase enzyme in the enzyme preparation is<br>
preferably higher than that of the strains of the Melanocarpus genus, especially the strains<br>
of the Melanocarpus albomyces species, especially the amount of enzyme naturally produced<br>
 by the M. albomyces IMI 255989 strain in its culture solution in growth conditions,<br>
which are not optimised to produce laccase. The amount of laccase in the enzyme preparation<br>
 is preferably over 10 mg/1, more preferably &gt;30 mg/1, even more preferably &gt;300 mg/1,<br>
still even more preferably &gt;500 mg/1; most preferably &gt;1 g/1.<br>
As stated above, the laccase according to the invention can be isolated from the strains of<br>
the Melanocarpus genus, especially from the strains of the Melanocarpus albomyces species,<br>
 especially from the M. albomyces IMI 255989 strain, but it can also be produced by<br>
the recombination technique by isolating genes that encode the laccases according to the<br>
invention and transferring them into a suitable production host.<br>
The laccase according to the invention can be produced in the culture solution of its natural<br>
host or a production host, from where it can be isolated and purified by using known<br>
methods of protein chemistry. If the culture solution contains a high enough amount of laccase,<br>
 but no other detrimental proteins, the culture solution may be used as such by simply<br>
separating the cells. The culture solution can possibly be concentrated. In different applications,<br>
 it is preferable to use an enzyme preparation containing an increased amount of laccase.<br>
 The increased amount of laccase can be prepared by producing the laccase enzyme in<br>
the culture solution of the production host by means of recombinant technology. The increased<br>
 amount refers to an amount of laccase enzyme, which exceeds the amount of laccase<br>
 enzyme naturally produced by the strains of the Melanocarpus genus, especially the<br>
M. albomyces strain, especially the IMI 255989 strain.<br>
A further object of the invention is an enzyme preparation containing an essential amount<br>
of the laccase enzyme according to the invention. This means that the laccase is the main<br>
activity of the enzyme preparation without any considerable amounts of other enzymes. A<br>
further object of the invention is also an enzyme preparation containing a laccase that can<br>
be isolated from the fungus of the Melanocarpus genus, and additives that are needed for<br>
the respective application. Such additives can comprise, for example, buffers and<br>
stabilizers.<br>
An object of the invention is also a nucleic acid molecule that encodes laccase. The nucleic<br>
acid molecule is selected from the group comprising:<br>
a nucleic acid molecule comprising the coding region of the nucleotide sequence as<br>
depicted in SEQ ID NO:1 or Fig. 15;<br>
a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide that comprises the amino acid<br>
sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO:2 or Fig. 15;<br>
a nucleic acid molecule comprising a coding sequence that differs from the coding<br>
sequence of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or Fig. 15 due to the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code;<br>
a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1<br>
or Fig. 15; and<br>
- a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide, which has laccase activity and<br>
the amino acid sequence of which shows at least 73% identity with the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or Fig. 15.<br>
The invention also embodies nucleic acid molecules that encode polypeptides, the amino<br>
acid sequence of which shows at least 75% identity with SEQ ID NO:2 or the amino acid<br>
sequence of Fig. 15, preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 85% identity,<br>
even more preferably at least 90% identity; most preferably at least 95% identity. It is most<br>
preferable if the amino acid sequence of the polypeptides according to the invention shows<br>
at least 99% identity with ID NO:2 or the amino acid sequence of Fig. 15 . If the similarity<br>
is assessed on the basis of homologous amino acids, the invention embodies the nucleic<br>
acid molecules, which encode polypeptides, the amino acid sequence of which is at least<br>
83% homologous to SEQ ID NO:2 or the amino acid sequence of Fig. 15, preferably at<br>
least 85% homologous, more preferably at least 90% homologous, even more preferably at<br>
least 95%, most preferably at least 99% homologous to SEQ ID NO:2 or the amino acid<br>
sequence of Fig. 15.<br>
The invention also embodies the nucleic acid molecules, which are hybridised to the sequence<br>
 SEQ ID NO:1 in hybridising conditions, where the hybridisation solution contains<br>
6XSSC, 5XDenhadt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured DNA and hybridisation is<br>
carried out at 50-60°C. Another alternative is that the hybridisation solution contains<br>
6XSSC, 5XDenhadt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured DNA, 50% formamide<br>
and, in that case, hybridisation is carried out at 25-35°C. The invention especially<br>
embodies those nucleic acid molecules, which are hybridised to the SEQ ID NO:1 sequence<br>
 in stringent conditions, whereby hybridisation is carried out in accordance with the<br>
first alternative, otherwise in the same conditions, but at 68°C and, according to the second<br>
alternative, at 42°C. 50x Denhadt is 10 g/1 Ficoll, 10 g/l polYvjnyl pyrrolidone, 10 g/1 bovine<br>
 serum albumin and the SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.6<br>
The nucleic acid molecules refer to DNA, RNA or, for example, cDNA.<br>
The invention also relates to polypeptides, which have laccase activity and which are encoded<br>
 by the nucleic acid molecules defined above. The invention further relates to polypeptides,<br>
 the amino acid sequence of which, in the way described above, is identical or<br>
homologous with SEQ ID NO:2 or the amino acid sequence of Fig. 15.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for producing laccase, comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
a nucleic acid molecule or vector according to the invention is transferred into a<br>
micro-organism host cell to express the nucleic acid molecule and, optionally, to<br>
secrete it from the host cell; and<br>
a polypeptide that has laccase activity is recovered either from the cells or the culture<br>
 solution of the micro-organism host.<br>
The laccase according to the invention is exceptionally well suited to industrial applications,<br>
 wherein the prevailing pH and temperature conditions are high. Such applications<br>
include those of the forest industry, which affect lignin or extractives (either directly or by<br>
mediators), manufacture of fibre products and boards from mechanically ground lignincontaining<br>
 fibres, improvement of the runnability of paper machines, and other applications,<br>
 oxidation of polymers, such as lignin, cellulose, and/or starch (either directly or by<br>
mediators), as well as oxidation of other chemicals, such as alkenes or colour molecules. In<br>
these applications, the temperature is often over 60°C, generally as high as 80°C, and the<br>
pH is close to neutral or slightly higher. The enzyme according to the invention works extremely<br>
 well in conditions, where both the pH and the temperature are simultaneously<br>
rather high.<br>

activities, such as peroxidase activity, depending on the application of the enzyme preparation.<br><br>
The enzyme preparation containing laccase can also contain a suitable mediator, which is<br>
used to enhance the operation of the laccase. Suitable mediators include, e.g., Tempo (=<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy), HBT( =l-hydroxybenzotriazole), ABTS=2,2'-<br>
azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazole-6-sulphonate, violuric acid, NHA (=N-hydroxy-acetanilide).<br>
Screening of microbes that produce laccase<br>
Microbes that produce laccase can be isolated from nature or they can be screened from<br>
already isolated and identified strains of culture collections by using screening methods<br>
that are well known in microbiology. As laccases belong to phenoloxidases, methods that<br>
are suitable for screening phenoloxidases are used in the screenings. Screenings can be carried<br>
 out studying the production of the enzyme either on a solid culture on plate cultivations<br>
 or in a liquid culture medium by measuring the enzyme activity.<br>
When looking for new laccases that tolerate higher temperatures and pHs than the majority<br>
of known laccases, it is worthwhile to screen microbes from environments, where they live<br>
in warm and/or alkaline conditions. Such environments are found, for example, in composts,<br>
 piles of wood chips or tropical areas.<br>
The production of phenoloxidases by the positive fungi found in the screening can be<br>
studied on plates by adding substrates of phenoloxidases on top of the mycelium. By using<br>
these drop tests, it can be find out, whether the positive reactions on the plates are caused<br>
by peroxidases or laccases. Suitable reagents include ABTS, syringaldazine, and guaiacol,<br>
and in observing peroxidases, hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The micro-organism, which produces phenoloxidase and which is found as a result of<br>
screening is cultivated on a suitable medium, and the formation of phenoloxidase in the<br>
culture solution is observed by a method that is suitable for measuring the phenoloxidase<br>
activity. Suitable culture media for fungi include, for example, malt extract and potato<br>
dextrose media, and suitable substrates for measuring the activity include ABTS, guaiacol,<br>
and syringaldazine. For many fungi, the production of phenoloxidases requires an inducer.<br>
These include, for example, aromatic compounds, materials containing lignin, surfaceactive<br>
 agents, certain sources of carbon, and copper sulphate. The laccase activity can be<br>
measured by using ABTS as a substrate, the laccase oxidizes it dark green. The measurement<br>
 can be made in accordance with the method of Niku-Paavola et al. (1988). The lac-<br>
case activity can also be measured by using a guaiacol method in accordance with the<br>
method of Paszczynski et al. (1985).<br>
After a sufficient amount of an interesting laccase has been produced, the enzyme is purified<br>
 and its properties are characterised . The temperature and pH behaviour as well as the<br>
isoelectric point of the enzyme can be determined.<br>
Laccase producers can also be screened by the homology of the sequences of the laccase<br>
genes. In that case, nucleotides based on the conserved regions of the amino end of the laccase<br>
 genes can be used as primers in PCR, and look for gene sequences, which are homologous<br>
 to known laccases, in the genome of various fungi, for example.<br>
Determination of laccase activity at various temperatures can be carried out by the ABTS<br>
method, as described in Example 1. The pH optimum of the laccase can be determined by<br>
the guaiacol method in a suitable buffer at different pH values. When the pH is over 7, the<br>
operation of the ABTS in the activity analysis weakens.<br>
The thermal stability can be determined by incubating an enzyme sample at various temperatures<br>
 in a suitable buffer at a certain pH. The residual activity of the enzyme at each<br>
temperature can be defined by the ABTS method, for example.<br>
The pH stability can be determined by incubating the enzyme sample at various pH values<br>
in a suitable buffer. The residual activity can be determined by the ABTS method, for<br>
example.<br>
Isolation and purification of laccase<br>
The enzyme can be purified by using conventional methods of enzyme chemistry, such as<br>
salt precipitation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction <br>
chromatography. Purification can be monitored by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.<br>
 The enzyme activity of the purified enzyme at various temperatures and pH val-<br>
ues can be determined; similarly, the molecular weight and the isoelectric point can be determined.<br>
In the examples of this invention, the production of laccase is described by cultivating the<br>
Melanocarpus albomyces strain on a rich culture medium. During cultivation, the laccase<br>
activity was monitored in accordance with the ABTS method of Niku-Paavola et al.<br>
(1988), based on the generation of a dark green cation radical from the ABTS under the<br>
effect of the laccase. However, the invention is not limited to the M. albomyces laccases<br>
produced on this medium only.<br>
The M. albomyces laccase was purified from a culture solution, from which the cells were<br>
removed by filtration or centrifugation. The culture solution was further concentrated using<br>
ultrafiltration. An anion exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
 were used for further purification. The molecular weight cut off value in ultrafiltration<br>
 was about 30 kDa. The anion exchange chromatography was carried out at pH 5 in<br>
an acetate buffer, and the laccase was eluted from the column with an increasing linear<br>
gradient of Na2SO4. The best fractions of the ion exchange were further purified by hydrophobic<br>
 interaction chromatography, at pH 5 in an acetate buffer. The sample was bound at<br>
0.7 M Na2SO4 concentration and eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of Na2SO4.<br>
However, it is possible to separate the enzyme by using other known purification methods<br>
as well.<br>
The molecular size, the isoelectric point, and the pH and temperature profiles of the purified<br>
 M. albomyces laccase were determined.<br>
The purified enzyme refers to an enzyme preparation, which has no other proteins in addition<br>
 to the laccase band, which can be observed, as defined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie<br>
staining. In this application, the enzyme is purified by ultrafiltration, anion exchange chromatography,<br>
 and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purity of the obtained laccase<br>
 that is essentially free from other proteins is &gt;90%.<br>
The molecular size of the purified M. albomyces laccase was 80 kDa, determined by SDS<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In isoelectric focusing by the Multiphor II electrophoresis<br>
 equipment (Pharmacia LKB), 4.0 was determined as the isoelectric point. The activity<br>
of the M. albomyces laccase was highest at the temperature of 70°C and its pH optimum<br>
was 7.5. After 2 hours of incubation at 60°C, the M. albomyces laccase retained 100 % of<br>
its activity. Furthermore, its pH stability improved, when the pH increased.<br>
Production of laccase<br>
The laccase according to the invention can be produced in the culture solution of its natural<br>
host or a production host, from where it can be isolated and purified by using known<br>
methods of protein chemistry. If the culture solution contains a sufficiently high amount of<br>
laccase but no other detrimental proteins, it may be possible to use the culture solution as<br>
such by simply separating the cells. When so desired, the culture solution can be concentrated<br>
 and/or purified. It is preferable to use, in various applications, an enzyme preparation<br>
containing an increased amount of laccase. Such an enzyme preparation can be prepared by<br>
producing the increased amount of laccase enzyme in the culture solution of the production<br>
host by means of gene technology. The increased amount refers to an amount of laccase<br>
enzyme, which exceeds the amount of laccase enzyme naturally produced by the M. albomyces<br>
 strain, strain IMI 255989 in particular.<br>
The laccase according to the invention can also be produced by recombinant technique by<br>
isolating the genes that encode the laccases according to the invention and by transferring<br>
them to a suitable production host. The laccase-encoding genes can be isolated from a<br>
cDNA library in any of the following ways. The cDNA library can be built in a suitable<br>
yeast expression vector and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, for example.<br>
The clones that produce laccase are identified, for example, on the basis of activity by<br>
using plates that contain ABTS substrate. Another possibility is to connect the cDNA<br>
library to a AZAP vector and infect the Escherichia coli cells with the obtained production<br>
bank. The clones that encode laccase are identified either with the aid of a polyclonal antibody<br>
 or DNA hybridisation. If polyclonal antibodies are used, they are produced against a<br>
purified laccase protein in a rabbit, for example. In hybridisation, fragments of the laccase<br>
gene provided by PCR are used as a probe. In that case, the sequences of the PCR primers<br>
are either based on the regions generally conserved in the laccase genes (e.g., regions that<br>
correspond to the amino acids of the active centre) and/or on the sequence of the aminoterminal<br>
 end of the purified laccase protein or that of an internal peptide. Furthermore, the<br>
oligodT region bound to the polyA region of the tail of each messenger RNA can be used<br>
as the PCR primer.<br>
The isolated laccase cDNAs are sequenced. The connection between the isolated cDNA<br>
and the isolated enzyme can be ascertained by amino acid sequencing, which is made of the<br>
enzyme. The chromosomal copy of the laccase gene can either be isolated by PCR or from<br>
the genomic library made in the l vector, and the locations of the introns can be established<br>
by sequencing.<br>
Isolation of the gene of the M. albomyces laccase<br>
It was not possible to isolate the gene of the M. albomyces laccase on the basis of the messenger<br>
 RNA and the cDNA library. Creating a representative cDNA library was not successful.<br>
 Surprisingly, a problem was caused by the fact that M. albomyces produces laccase<br>
in the late cultivation phase, when many cells were already autolyzed, and the messenger<br>
RNA partially degradad or it is difficult to isolate pure. Therefore, instead of the cDNA<br>
library, the gene had to be isolated from a genomic gene library. The isolation of the gene<br>
is described in detail in Example 9.<br>
The sequence of the laccase gene is shown in Fig. 15 and in the sequence listing (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1). The length of the gene is 2279 bp, including introns. As Fig. 15 shows, the number<br>
of the base that starts the encoding region is 286, the introns are in positions 541-618, 698-<br>
770, 783-869, 1913-1999, 2069-2150. The last encoding base is 2561.<br>
The gene encodes a polypeptide of a length of 623 amino acids. When comparing the<br>
amino acid sequence, by using the Blast method (Altschul et al., 1990), with the amino acid<br>
sequence of Myceliophtora disclosed in patent application WO 9533836, it was discovered<br>
that the amino acid sequences were 72% identical (identities 450/623, 72%) and 82% homologous<br>
 (positives 518/623, 82%; positives refer to homologous amino acids), (gaps<br>
=4/623, 0%).<br>
When a corresponding comparison was made with Podospora anserina laccase (Fernandez<br>
-Larrea and Stahl, 1996), it was discovered that the sequences were 68% identical<br>
(identities 427/627, 68%), and 79% homologous (positives 502/627, 79%) (gaps=l2/627,<br>
1%).<br>
The isolated laccase gene is utilized in protein production in other organisms. Such production<br>
 hosts include the Aspergillus production systems mentioned above, such as A.<br>
oryzae or A. niger (US 5,843,745, US 5,770,418, WO 9708325 and WO 9533386), the<br>
production system developed for the fungus Trichoderma (EP 244 234), or the production<br>
system developed for fungal species of Fusarium, such as F. oxysporum (Malardier et al.<br>
1989), the production systems developed for a Bacillus bacterium, such as the B. subtilis o:<br>
the E. coli bacterium, the yeasts Saccharomyces, Shizosaccharomyces or Pichia pastons,<br>
or a Streptomyces actinomycete or some other microbe or mammalian cell.<br>
Optimizing the production of laccase<br>
The production of laccase can also be improved by optimising the culture conditions and<br>
the culture medium of a wild or a recombinant strain. When optimising the culture medium,<br>
 for example, the effect of the quality (among others, an organic or inorganic source<br>
of nitrogen) and the quantity of the source of nitrogen on the laccase production. When<br>
needed, the source of nitrogen is limited in order to achieve a higher yield. Similarly, the<br>
effect of the source of carbon is established. A source of carbon that is optimal for the enzyme<br>
 production is selected. When needed, the amount of carbon source can also be<br>
limited. The carbon/nitrogen ratio is optimised to be the best for the production of enzyme.<br>
The growing conditions are optimised to be the best possible for the enzyme production in<br>
question. The microbe is grown at a pH and temperature optimal for enzyme production.<br>
Proper mixing and air supply guarantee an optimal aeration during fermentation. In fermentation,<br>
 inducers of laccase production, such as veratryl alcohol, xylidine, or lignin can<br>
also be used. The way and the time of adding the inducers, as well as their concentration<br>
are optimised.<br>
Use of laccase in various applications<br>
Generally, the laccase according to the invention is well suited to be used in applications,<br>
wherein laccases can be used, such as gel formation, gluing of fibres, treatment of cork,<br>
removal of dye (especially textile dyes), dyeing of fibres, protein treatment, detergents,<br>
anti-microbial applications, starch applications, oxidation of chemicals, removal of biofilm,<br>
preparation of lignin derivatives, medical analysis, reducing the shrinkage of wool, baking,<br>
improving the preservability of beer, production of dye, removal of oxygen from oil<br>
products, and the production of iodine. When so desired, the laccase according to the<br>
invention can also be immobilized for certain purposes.<br>
The laccase according to the invention is especially well suited to industrial applications,<br>
wherein the prevailing pH and temperature conditions are high. Such applications include,<br>
among others, applications of the forest industry, manufacture of fibre products and boards<br>
from mechanically ground, lignin-containing fibres, improvement of the runnability of<br>
paper machines and other applications, oxidation of polymers and that of other chemicals,<br>
such as dye molecules. In these applications, the temperature is often over 60°C, generally<br>
as much as 80°C, and the pH near neutral or slightly alkalic.<br>
hi all applications, it is essential that enough oxygen is brought to the reaction. Oxygen is<br>
the reducing substrate needed by the laccase. hi some cases, especially when the substrate<br>
concentration is low, there can be enough oxygen in the reaction mixture as such but it can<br>
also be added either by bringing air or oxygen or air enriched with oxygen to the reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
When needed, mediators are used as additives in the reactions.<br>
The laccase according to the invention is well suited to oxidation of colouring agents, for<br>
example. The dye molecules are brought into contact with the laccase at pH 4-8, for<br>
example, at pH 4.5-7.5, preferably at pH 6-8, more preferably at pH 7-8, the temperature<br>
being within a range of 25-80°C, preferably 40-80°C, more preferably 50-80°C; most<br>
preferably 60-80°C. Oxygen is added into the reaction as needed. The amount of laccase is<br>
1-1000 nkat/g, preferably 10-500 nkat/g, most preferably 20-200 nkat/g of colouring agent.<br>
The reaction is allowed to take place for 5 min to 24 hours, preferably for 30 min to 2<br>
hours.<br>
The laccase according to the invention is also well suited to polymerisation. The selected<br>
compound to be polymerised is brought into contact with the laccase in the same conditions<br>
 as described above. The reaction mixture can be aerated during the test. Polymerisation<br>
 can be monitored by following the increase in the molecular weight of the polymerised<br>
compound, for example by GPC (gel permeation chromatography).<br>
The laccase according to the invention can also be used to improve the runnability of paper<br>
machines. The laccase can be used to improve the runnability of paper machines by<br>
polymerising compounds originating from lignin and extractives and by decreasing the detrimental<br>
 growth of microbes in the paper machine. Generally, the conditions in the paper<br>
machine are about pH 5-7 and the temperature 60-80°C. The laccase can be added into the<br>
process water or into the head box or the circulation water system of the paper machine<br>
without essentially needing to change the conditions prevailing at the paper machine. The<br>
pH can be within 5-8 and the temperature within 50-80°C. The amount of laccase can be 1-1000<br>
 nkat/g, preferably 10-500 nkat/g of dry matter, fibres or litres of circulation water.<br>
The treatment time can be 5 min to 24 hours, preferably 30 min to 2 hours.<br>
The laccase according to the invention can also be used in oxidation of fibres. Lignincontain<br>
ing fibres can be brought into contact with the laccase at a temperature of 50-80°C,<br>
even as high as 50-100°C, preferably at a temperature of 60-80°C, at pH 5-8, preferably at<br>
pH 6-8, the laccase concentration being 1-1000 nkat/g of fibres, preferably 10-500 nkat/g<br>
of fibres, the reaction time being 2 min to 24 hours, preferably 10 min to 2 hours. Due to<br>
the laccase treatment, the strength properties of the fibres improve, which can be utilised,<br>
for example, in the manufacture of fibre boards, such as MDF boards, or in paper or cardboard<br>
 products, which are made of mechanically ground lignin-containing fibres.<br>
In addition to the application examples mentioned above, the laccase according to the invention<br>
 can also be used in delignification of fibres. The laccase can be in contact with the<br>
fibres that are to be delignified, such as kraft fibres, with the kappa value being 20-30,<br>
preferably about 25, the consistency being 5-15, preferably about 10 %, preferably in the<br>
presence of a mediator the amount of mediator being 1-5% of the pulp, preferably 3% of<br>
the pulp, the pH being within 5-8, preferably within 6-8, the temperature being within 50-<br>
80°C, preferably within 60-80°C. The reaction time can be between 5 min to 24 hours,<br>
preferably 30 min to 2 hours. The amount of laccase can be 10-1000 nkat/g, preferably 10-500<br>
 nkat/g in an oxygen pressure of 0.5 Mpa.<br>
The following examples are intended for illustration of the present invention and should<br>
not be interpreted as limiting the present invention in any way.<br>
Example 1.<br>
Production of M. albomyces laccase<br>
M. albomyces fungus was kept on oat-agar plates (Difco). Both the inoculum and the production<br>
 medium contained<br>
25 g/1 glucose (AnalaR)<br>
27.5 g/1 Bacto yeast extract (Difco)<br>
0.5 mg/ml Indulin AT (Sigma)<br>
0.04 1/1 mineral solution containing:<br>
1.0 g/1 CaCl2 • 2H2O (Riedel-de Han)<br>
1.0 g/1 FeSO4 • 7H2O (Riedel-de Han)<br>
0.1 g/1 ZnSO4 • 7H2O (Merck)<br>
0.16 g/1 CuSO4 • 5H2O (Merck)<br>
1.0 g/1 Na2EDTA (Riedel-de Han).<br>
The glucose solution was sterilized separately.<br>
First, 100 ml of medium was inoculated with 3-4 pieces (about a 1 cm2) cut from well<br>
grown mycelium on oatmeal agar. The cultivation temperature was 37°C and the agitation<br>
speed 120 rpm. After 2 days of cultivation, the mycelium was homogenized, and 900 ml of<br>
the sterile culture was inoculated with 100 ml of the homogenized inoculum. The volume<br>
of the production culture was 1 1; the cultivation temperature was 37°C, and the agitation<br>
speed 160 rpm. Cultivation was continued for 14 days. Four parallel cultures were made.<br>
Enzyme activity assay<br>
The laccase activity of the M. albomyces culture solutions was measured by using ABTS<br>
Laccase oxidizes ABTS to a dark green cation radical. The activity assay was carried out<br>
in accordance with the method developed by Niku-Paavola et al. (1988). The sample was<br>
diluted with 0.025 M succinate buffer, pH 4.5. 0.350 ml of ABTS solution (11 g/1) was<br>
added into 1.15 ml of the dilution, and the reaction was followed for 2 minutes by the Perkin<br>
 Elmer Lambda 20 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 436 nm.<br>
The measured laccase activities of the M. albomyces cultures are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Purification of M. albomyces laccase<br>
Determination of of the protein content<br>
The protein contents were determined by the DC Protein Assay kit of Bio-Rad, based on a<br>
method developed by Lowry et al. (1951). The assays were carried out using the reagents<br>
of the kit, and the intensity of the colour reaction thus formed was measured on a wavelength<br>
 of 750 nm by the Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. Each time of measurement, a<br>
standard curve was also defined using solutions containing 0.25-1.25 g/1 of bovine serum<br>
albumin (BSA, Bio-Rad).<br>
Purification<br>
The culture solution, from which cells had been removed by filtration, was ultrafiltrated by<br>
the Amicon 8400 filtering equipment, using a PM30 membrane (Millipore). In the filtration,<br>
 the solution was concentrated and distilled water was added so that it was possible to<br>
reduce the conductivity of the solution to the level required by ion exchange chromatography.<br>
 The conductivity was measured by using an EDV Instruments conductivity instrument<br>
(platinum electrode Mettler Toledo).<br>
After ultrafiltration, the solution was purified by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE<br>
Sepharose Fast Flow, h=10 cm, V=20 ml, Pharmacia). The resin was equilibrated at room<br>
temperature with 0.01 M acetate buffer, pH 5. The proteins were eluted with an increasing<br>
linear saline gradient by using 0-0.5 M sodium sulphate (Merck). The total volume of the<br>
gradient was 90 ml and the flow rate 2 ml/min. During the gradient, 4-ml fractions were<br>
collected. The protein content, laccase activity, and the conductivity of the fractions were<br>
assayed. The laccase activity and the protein content of the fractions are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The best laccase fractions of the anion exchange were combined, and they were further purified<br>
 by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) (Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow, h=9<br>
cm, V=18 ml, Pharmacia). The hydrophobicity of the proteins was increased before the run<br>
by adding Na2SO4 into the sample, so that the salt content became 0.7 M. The resin was<br>
equilibrated with 1 M Na2SO4 in 0.02 M citrate buffer, pH 5, at room temperature. The<br>
sample was eluted from the column with a decreasing linear saline gradient by using 0.7-0<br>
M Na2SO4 in citrate buffer. The total volume of the gradient was 90 ml and the flow rate 2<br>
ml/min. After the gradient, the resin was washed with the equilibrium buffer and, finally,<br>
with water. During the gradient and subsequent washes both with buffer and water, 3.5-ml<br>
fractions were collected, the laccase activity, the protein content, and the salt content of<br>
which were measured (Fig. 3).<br>
The most interesting fractions of both the ion exchange and HIC were analysed by SDS<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for monitoring the purification of the laccase<br>
 in accordance with the method of Laemmli (1970). In the gel electrophoresis, the<br>
equipment of Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad Ready Gel Cell), and ready polyacrylamide gels (12 %<br>
Tris-HCl Ready Gel) were used. The gels were stained with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R<br>
350 dye solution (Pharmacia). The Prestained Protein Marker Broad Range #7708S (New<br>
England BioLabs) was used as the protein standard.<br>
The molecular weight of the M. albomyces laccase as defined by the SDS PAGE was 80<br>
kDa.<br>
Example 3.<br>
Characterization of the M. albomyces laccase<br>
Temperature dependence of the activity<br>
The dependence of activity of the purified M. albomyces laccase on the temperature was<br>
defined by measuring the laccase activity by ABTS at temperatures of 25,40, 50, 60, 70,<br>
80 and 90 °C. The enzyme was diluted into tempered 0.025 M succinate buffer, pH 4.5.<br>
Immediately after adding the enzyme, the tempered ABTS solution was added. The sample<br>
was incubated for two minutes at the desired temperature, after which the absorbance was<br>
measured at the wavelength of 436 nm. In order for the added enzyme solution not to considerably<br>
 decrease the temperature of the buffer, the volume of the enzyme added into the<br>
buffer in all dilutions was below 7 % of the total volume. The dependence of the activity<br>
of the M. albomyces laccase on the temperature is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
pH optimum<br>
The pH optimum of the purified M. albomyces laccase was determined by measuring the<br>
laccase activity by the guaiacol method in Mcllvaine buffer at pH values of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and<br>
8. Guaiacol was selected because ABTS does not work when the pH is over 7. The enzyme<br>
was diluted into the buffers, and immediately after adding the enzyme, 25 ml of a 1% guai-<br>
acol solution was added. The reaction was followed for 5 minutes by a spectrophotometer<br>
at the wavelength of 465 nm. The dependence of the activity of the M. albomyces laccase<br>
on the pH is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Thermal stability<br>
The thermal stability of the M. albomyces laccase was determined by incubating the enzyme<br>
 at 50, 60, 70 and 80°C in 0.06 M citrate buffer, pH 6. The residual activity of the enzyme<br>
 at each temperature was defined by the ABTS method after incubation of 15, 30, 60<br>
and 120 minutes. The results of the thermal stability measurements are shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The thermal stability of the purified M. albomyces laccase was determined in the conditions<br>
 described above. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The results indicate that the residual<br>
activity of the enzyme remained essentially unchanged at 60°C for as much as 2 hours.<br>
After 4 hours of incubation, there was still 60% residual activity left and after 6 hours,<br>
40%.<br>
pH stability<br>
The pH stability of the M. albomyces laccase was determined by incubating the enzyme at<br>
pH values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in Mcllvaine buffer at room temperature. The residual activity<br>
 of the enzyme in the incubated samples at each pH was defined by the ABTS method<br>
after incubation of 1, 3, 5, and 22 hours. The results of the pH stability measurements are<br>
shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Isoelectric point<br>
The isoelectric point of the M. albomyces laccase was determined by isoelectric focusing.<br>
The 0.5 mm thick polylacrylamide gel contained 7.5% acrylamide (Merck), 0.225% N,N'bis-methy<br>
leneacrylamide (Merck), 6 % ampholyte (Pharmalyte 2.5 - 5 for IEF, Pharmacia),<br>
0.05% ammonium persulphate (Merck) and 0.05% N,N,N,N'-tetramethylene diamine<br>
(Merck). Isoelectric focusing was carried out using the Multiphor II electrophoresis equipment<br>
 (Pharmacia LKB). The gels were stained using active dyeing, wherein the gel was<br>
dipped for about 10 seconds in a dilute ABTS solution (1 g/1). After about 15 minutes, the<br>
laccase bands appeared green. The pH distribution of the gel was determined using a pH<br>
surface electrode (Mettler Toledo). On the basis of isoelectric focusing, the isoelectric<br>
point of the M. albomyces laccase was 4.0.<br>
Example 4<br>
Use of the M. albomyces laccase in oxidation of dyes<br>
The tests were conducted by using a thermophilic M. albomyces laccase and the reference<br>
tests by a well-known laccase, which was isolated from Trametes hirsuta fungus. A conventional<br>
 substrate, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, was used as the substrate. The substrate concentration<br>
 was 1 mmol/1, pH 4.5-7.5, and the temperatures 40 or 60°C. The amount of laccase<br>
was 15 nkat/g. The reaction mixtures were aerated during the test. At the end of the test (30<br>
min), it was discovered that the thermophilic M. albomyces laccase worked better at a high<br>
temperature and pH, when the formation of colour from the dimethoxyphenol was measured<br>
 at a wavelength of 468 nm (Fig. 9 and 10).<br>
Laccases can be used in removing colour from textile dyes. Laccases oxidize many dyes,<br>
which can be observed as colour removal. The colour removal of textile dyes was measured<br>
 by using a dye commonly used in the textile industry, Diamond Black PLC. The laccase<br>
 treatment was carried out at pH 7.5 and temperatures of 40 and 60°C for 2 hours, the<br>
laccase dose being 20 nkat/mg of dye. On the basis of a maximum absorbance (560 nm)<br>
measurement, the Melanocarpus laccase removed 34% of the colour at 40°C and 16% at<br>
60°C, while the Trametes laccase only removed 14% at 40°C and only 1% at 60°C (Fig. 1).<br>
The ability of the M. albomyces laccase to remove colour was compared with that of the T.<br>
hirsuta laccase at pH 5 and 8. The colour removal ability was studied using dyes commonly<br>
 used in the textile industry. A colour solution (50 rng/1) was oxidized with a laccase<br>
dose of 1 nkat/ml in 50 raM succinate buffer (pH 5) or in a phosphate buffer (pH 8) for 24<br>
hours at a temperature of 40°C. The colour removal was followed visually. The results are<br>
shown in Table 1. As the results indicate, both enzymes oxidized the tested dyes so that<br>
they turned colourless at pH 5. The T. hirsuta laccase was ineffective at pH 8, and did not<br>
oxidize the dyes tested, unlike the M. albomyces laccase. which even at pH 8 was able to<br>
oxidize the dyes. The results indicate that the behaviour of the M. albomyces laccase in<br>
oxidation of dyes is considerably more extensive than that of the conventional Trametes<br>
laccase.<br>
Example 5<br>
Use of the M. albomyces laccase in polymerisation<br>
The test studied the polymerisation of a model compound (lignin, Westvaco or Indulin AT,<br>
Sigma) with a thermophilic laccase. Lignin is a typical aromatic substrate of laccase. The<br>
reference tests were carried out using a laccase that had been isolated from Trametes hirsuta.<br>
 The test conditions were as follows: substrate concentration 1%, pH 7.5, and temperatures<br>
 40 or 60°C. The amount of laccase was 200 nkat/g. The reaction mixtures were<br>
aerated during the test. The polymerisation was followed by determining the increase in the<br>
molecular weight of the polymerised lignin by GPC (gel permeation chromatography). At<br>
the end of the reaction (30 minutes), it was discovered that the thermophilic M. albomyces<br>
laccase worked more effectively than the reference laccase at a high temperature and pH.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates a situation, wherein the polymerisation of lignin is carried out at 40°C<br>
and, correspondingly, at 60°C in Fig. 13. The Melanocarpus laccase causes an average increase<br>
 in the molecular size and a decrease in the portion of small molecules obviously<br>
better than the Trametes laccase.<br>
Example 6<br>
Use of the M. albomyces laccase in improving the runnability of paper machines<br>
Laccase can be used to improve the runnability of paper machines by polymerising compounds<br>
 originating in lignin and extractives and by decreasing the microbiological problems<br>
 of the paper machine. Generally, the conditions of the paper machine are: the pH is 5-<br>
7 and the temperature 60-80°C. Treatment tests were conducted using a thermophilic and a<br>
conventional reference laccase in the paper machine conditions by using soluble compounds<br>
 originating from lignin and extractives, isolated from the paper machine. The substrate<br>
 concentration was 0.5% dry weight, the pH 7, and the temperature 70°C. Intensive<br>
agitation ensured sufficient oxygen content in the reaction. The reaction was monitored as<br>
the polymerisation of the aromatic and other compounds, which worked as the substrates of<br>
the laccase, by gel filtration (GPC). It was discovered that the reaction by the thermophilic<br>
M. albomyces laccase was more effective than by the reference laccase.<br>
Fig. 14 shows how the Melanocarpus and Trametes laccases behave in the polymerisation<br>
of compounds originating from lignin and extractives at 70°C. In Fig. 14, the Melanocarpus<br>
 laccase has clearly reduced the amount of small molecules.<br>
Example 7<br>
Use of the M. albomyces laccase in oxidation of fibres<br>
Lignin-containing fibres, which were mechanically ground without chemical delignification,<br>
 were treated with thermophilic M. albomyces laccase to activate and polymerise the<br>
lignin on the surface of the fibres. The treatments were conducted in the following condi-<br>
tions: the temperatures were 50 and 70°C, the pH 6, and the laccase concentration 200<br>
nkat/g of fibres. The reaction mixture was aerated by blowing oxygen into the reaction<br>
mixture. The reference was a conventional laccase that was isolated from the Trametes hirsuta<br>
 fungus. Hand sheets were prepared from the treated fibres. The physical properties of<br>
the sheets were measured. The results (Table 2) indicate that the density of the sheets made<br>
of the fibres treated with the M. albomyces laccase was clearly higher and the light scattering<br>
 smaller than those of the reference sheets. No corresponding change was observed in<br>
sheets, which were made of fibres treated with the T. hirsuta laccase. The effect was especially<br>
 obvious at an increased temperature of 70°C, wherein the M. albomyces laccase, because <br>
of its good thermal stability, behaved advantageously compared with the reference<br>
laccase that was isolated from the T. hirsuta fungus. On the basis of the result, it can be<br>
concluded that it was possible to use the M. albomyces laccase to polymerise lignin onto<br>
the surface of the fibres in the conditions used.<br>
Example 8<br>
Use of the M. albomyces laccase in delignification of fibres<br>
Mediators can be used for expanding the substrate range of the laccase, among others, in<br>
delignification or other indirect oxidation of polymers. Hydroxybenzotriazole was selected<br>
as the mediator. Thermophilic laccase was used to degrade the lignin of kraft fibres in mediator-assisted<br>
 oxidation. The reaction conditions were as follows: Kraft pulp, the kappa<br>
number about 29, the consistency 4%, the amount of mediator 1% of the pulp, the pH ad-<br>
justed to 7, and the temperature 70°C, the reaction time 2 hours, the amount of laccase 500<br>
nkat/g, in oxygen pressure (0.5 mPa). Trametes laccase served as a reference material. After<br>
 the treatments, the pulps were subjected to alkali extraction, chelation, and one-stage<br>
peroxide bleaching. Dissolution of the lignin was monitored measuring the absorbance of<br>
the filtrate at a wavelength of 280 nm after alkali extraction. Handsheets were prepared of<br>
the pulps and ISO Brightness , and the kappa numbers were measured. As the results indicate<br>
 (Table 3), the M. albomyces laccase works more effectively in the test conditions than<br>
the reference laccase; it decreased the kappa value of the sheets (the amount of lignin) and<br>
increased the absorbance280nm of the filtrate more than the reference laccase.<br>
Example 9<br>
Isolation of the gene and the cDNA of the M, albomyces laccase<br>
Total DNA was isolated from the cells according to Raeder and Broda (1985). A genomic<br>
library was constructed using a commercial reaction package (SuperCos I Cosmid Vector<br>
Kit, Stratagene), following the instructions of the manufacturer. 100 mg of DNA were partially<br>
 cleaved with 5 U of a Sau3AI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) by incubating<br>
 for 10 minutes at 37°C. The digested DNA was dephosphorylated with 20 U of CIAP<br>
(Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase, Finnzymes). The DNA molecules of different<br>
lengths were separated with a 15-30% sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugating for 22 hours<br>
at a temperature of 20°C and a rotational speed of 22000 rpm (the Beckman SW 41 TI ro-<br>
tor). The 12-ml sucrose gradient was divided into 300-ml fractions, and 10 m1 of every second<br>
 fraction were examined on 0.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The fractions, which<br>
on the basis of the gel electrophoresis contained DNA fragments of more than 20 kilobasepairs<br>
 in length, were combined, and the DNA was precipitated from them with ethanol. The<br>
obtained DNA (about 2 mg) was inserted into SuperCos I cosmid vector (about 1 mg),<br>
which had been digested with Xbal (New England Biolabs), and thereafter dephosphorylated<br>
 with CIAP and, finally, digested with BamHI (Boehringer Mannheim). Ligation<br>
was carried out with T4 DNA ligase (Promega) by incubating the mixture at 4°C overnight.<br>
The ligation mixture was packed into X particles by using a commercial reaction package<br>
(Gigapack III Gold packaging extract, Stratagene), following the instructions of the manufacturer,<br>
 and the packed phage was used to infect E. coli host cells (the XLl-Blue MR<br>
strain, Stratagene). One ligation provided more than 5x106 clones, which can be considered<br>
a representative gene bank.<br>
The hybridisation probe for the screening of the gene bank was obtained from the lac2 gene<br>
of the Podospora anserina fungus. This gene was selected as the probe, because the Nterminal<br>
 amino acid sequence and the internal peptides of the M. albomyces laccase were<br>
homologous to the amino acid sequence of the P. anserina laccase. P. anserina fungus was<br>
grown on a substrate, which is described in Fig. 1. Genomic DNA was isolated from a mycelium,<br>
 which was collected and freeze-dried after three days of growing, using a commercial<br>
 reaction package (Easy DNA Kit, Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. The Iac2 gene was multiplied by a PCR reaction, using primers that are based<br>
on the published sequence of the Iac2 gene: 5'-TGCCACACTGCCGCCAACCGTGCT-3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 3) (forward) and 5'-GTTCTTGATATACCAATCAGGATG-3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 4) (reverse). The PCR program used for multiplication comprised 26 cycles, wherein<br>
the temperature program was as follows: denaturation of DNA at 94°C for 45 seconds, insertion<br>
 of primers at 55°C for 1 min, extending the DNA chain with polymerase at 72°C<br>
for 2.5 min. Finally, the chain was extended at 72°C for 5 minutes. The obtained fragment<br>
of about 1.9 kilobasepairs in length was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Its behaviour<br>
 as a probe was examined by Southern hybridisation with the genomic DNA of the M.<br>
albomyces fungus as follows: in two different reactions, 40 mg of DNA was cleaved with<br>
80 U of EcoRI and Hindlll restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 5 hours.<br>
The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel; DNA was denatured<br>
and transferred onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (the method is<br>
described in Sambrook et al, 1989). The P. anserina Iac2 gene was labelled with a-32P-<br>
dCTP by using a commercial reaction package (Random primed DNA labelling kit, Boehringer<br>
 Mannheim) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and the bonding of<br>
the probe was examined at four different hybridisation temperatures: 48, 50, 55, and 60°C.<br>
The hybridisation solution contained 6xSSC, 1x Denhardt's (Sambrook et al, 1989), 0.5%<br>
SDS, and 100 Hg/ml of Herring Sperm DNA (the SSC contains 0.15 M NaC1 and 0.015 M<br>
sodium citrate at pH 7.0). The hybridisation contained about 5xl05 cpm/ml of labelled<br>
probe. After hybridisation, the membranes were washed in 2xSSC containing 0.1% SDS<br>
twice for five minutes at room temperature and, after this, for 30 minutes at the same temperature<br>
 as the hybridisation was made at. The membranes were enclosed in an exposure<br>
cassette with a film, and the exposed film showed that the P. anserina lac2 gene was hybridised<br>
 with a DNA fragment, which was about 4.5 kilobasepairs in length and cleaved<br>
with ExoRI enzyme.<br>
About 5x105 clones from the obtained genomic gene bank were placed on agar plates, and<br>
colonies that had been growing overnight were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes<br>
(Protran, Schleicher &amp; Schuell). The DNA contained by the colonies was denatured (Sambrook<br>
 et al., 1989) and then attached to the membranes by heating at 80°C for 2 hours. After<br>
 the attachment of DNA, the residuals of the bacterial colonies were washed from the<br>
membranes by scrubbing them with the washing fluid (Sambrook et al, 1989) at 48°C. The<br>
DNA bound to the membranes was hybridised overnight at a temperature of 57°C with a P.<br>
anserina Iac2 gene that was labelled with a-32P-dCTP (a hybridisation solution, as above).<br>
On the basis of the obtained hybridisation signals, several colonies were picked from the<br>
original plates, to which colonies the P. anserina lac2 gene had been hybridised. These<br>
colonies were further hybridised with the P. anserina lac2 gene and, on the basis of radioactive<br>
 signals, 6 colonies were selected for further examination. Cosmids (Plasmid purifi-<br>
cation protocol, Tip-500, QIAGEN) were isolated from them. The restriction enzyme,<br>
which made it possible to isolate the laccase gene from the cosmid, was sought for by<br>
cleaving the cosmids with 19 different restriction enzymes. The obtained fragments were<br>
subjected to Southern hybridisation at a temperature of 57°C, using the P. anserina lad<br>
gene, as above. An EcolRI fragment of about 4.5 kilobasepairs in length was again hybridised<br>
 with the lac2 gene. The cosmid was cleaved with EcoRI, and the fragment was purified<br>
 by agarose gel electrophoresis. The obtained fragment was inserted into plasmid<br>
pBluescriptSK' (Stratagene), and the plasmid was transformed into E. coli host cells (strain<br>
DH5cc, Gibco BRL) by electroporation. A clone was obtained from the transformation,<br>
containing the desired EcoRI fragment in pLLKl plasmid. A laccase gene was sequenced<br>
from this plasmid, using synthesized oligonucleotide primers. The sequencing reactions<br>
were carried out using a commercial reaction package (DNA Sequencing Kit, dRhodamine<br>
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction, PE Biosystems) in accordance with the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
To establish the introns contained by the M. albomyces laccase gene, a complementary<br>
DNA (cDNA) corresponding to the M. albomyces laccase was cloned by RACE-PCR, using<br>
 a commercial reaction package (FirstChoice™ RLM-RACE Kit, Ambion, Inc.) in accordance<br>
 with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated from the M. albomyces<br>
cells by a commercial reaction package (TRIZOL® Reagent, Life Technologies) in accordance<br>
 with the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was dephosphorylated and transcribed<br>
 into DNA by using an inverse transcribing enzyme, whereafter the 5' and 3' ends of<br>
the gene were multiplied by separate PCR reactions in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. The multiplication of both cDNA ends was carried out by two sequential PCR<br>
reactions using different primers. In the first reaction, the desired part of the laccase cDNA<br>
was multiplied using a gene-specific primer, and the second reaction ensured the multiplication<br>
 of the laccase cDNA by using another gene-specific primer. In each PCR reaction,<br>
one of the primers needed for the multiplication of the DNA came from the RLM-RACE<br>
Kit reaction package, and it was bound to the adapter regions connected to the ends of the<br>
cDNA. The PCR program used for multiplication comprised 35 cycles, wherein the temperature<br>
 program was as follows: denaturation of DNA at 94°C for 30 seconds, insertion of<br>
primers at 60-62°C for 30 sec, extension of DNA chain at 72°C for 2 minutes. In the multiplication<br>
 of the 5' end, the insertion temperature of the primers was 60°C, and in that of the<br>
3' end, 62°C. Finally, chain extension was carried out at 72°C for 7 minutes. The genespecific<br>
 primers used in the multiplication of the 5' end were as follows: in the first PCR<br>
reaction, 5'-GCCGGTGAGGATGTAGTCGATGAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 5), and in the second <br>
reaction, 5'-AGGTGACGTTGAACCAGTAGTTGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 6). The genespecific<br>
 primers used in the multiplication of the 3' end were as follows: in the first PCR<br>
reaction, 5'-CTGGTGCACTTCACGCAGAACAA-3'(SEQ ID NO: 7), and in the second<br>
reaction, 5'-AGAACCACTTCCAGGTGTCGCT-3'(SEQ ID NO: 8). From the RLM-<br>
RACE reactions, a fragment of 1194 basepairs in length was obtained from the 5' end, and<br>
from the 3' end, a fragment of 1322 basepairs in length. The fragments were isolated by<br>
agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO™ vector by using a commercial<br>
 reaction package (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
 instructions. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli host cells (strain<br>
TOPI OF', Invitrogen) by using electroporation in accordance with the instructions of the<br>
reaction package. The cloned fragments were sequenced and the positions of the introns in<br>
the gene of the M. albomyces laccase were established by comparing the genomic sequence<br>
with the cDNA sequence obtained.<br>
The genomic sequence of the gene is shown in Fig. 15. The introns are underlined.<br>

oxygen, the fibres that are to be oxidized are brought into contact with the laccase as<br>
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, the enzyme preparation as claimed, in any one of<br>
claims 9 to 12 or 25 to 28, or the polypeptide as claimed in claim 23 or 24, or the laccase<br>
obtained by the method as claimed in claim 22 at pH 5-8, a temperature of 50-80°C, for 5<br>
min - 24 hours with an amount of laccase, which is about 1 - 1000 nkat/g of dry matter<br>
fibres.<br>
33. A method for delignifying fibres, wherein, the presence of a sufficient amount of<br>
oxygen, the fibre that is to be delignified is brought into contact with the laccase as<br>
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, the enzyme preparation as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 9 to 12 or 25 to 28, or the polypeptide as claimed in claim 23 or 24, or the laccase<br>
obtained by the method as claimed in claim 22, the pH being within 5-8, the temperature<br>
within 50-80°C, for 5 min - 24 hours with an amount of laccase, which is about 1 - 1000<br>
nkat/g of dry matter fibres.<br>
34. A method for improving the runnability of paper machines, wherein the laccase as<br>
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, the enzyme preparation as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 9 to 12 or 25 to 28, or the polypeptide as claimed in claim 23 or 24, or the laccase<br>
obtained by the method as claimed in claim 22 is added into the process water or the head<br>
box of the paper machine 1-1000 nkat/g of dry matter, fibres or litres of circulation water.<br>
35. A method as claimed in any one of claims 30 to 34, wherein a mediator is used in<br>
the method, when needed.<br>
The invention relates to a new laccase enzyme, which can be<br>
isolated from the strains of the Melanocarpus genus, the M. albomyces<br>
strain in particular. The pH optimum of the enzyme is<br>
within 5-8 and the enzyme works at a temperature of 30-80°C.<br>
The isoelectric point of the enzyme is about 4.0 as determined<br>
by isoelectric focusing and the molecular weight about 80 kDa,<br>
defined by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme is especially well suited to<br>
applications, wherein the pH and temperature conditions are<br>
high. The invention also relates to a gene that encodes laccase<br>
enzyme, and a laccase enzyme produced by recombinant<br>
technology.</td>
