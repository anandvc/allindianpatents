				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fruit cereal flakes from Custard apple. <br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Custard apple (Seetaphal) is a tropical fruit grown in the tropical climate. The fruits well known for their delicious taste are heart shaped with light green skin and a soft creamy white flesh. Nutritionally, the fruit is rich in carbohydrate, minerals and excellent source of vitamin C. Besides, high nutritive value, it is known for its excellent medicinal properties. It is said to contain the qualities of the rejuvenating drugs. It has been found to be very useful to the brain and the nervous system. It also enhances muscular strength and tones up the heart. Processing of custard apple for preparation of fruit cereal flakes is rendered inaccessible due to its characteristic property of discolouration, development of bitterness and off-flavour, when the fruit pulp is heated above 55°C. The fresh fruit pulp contains ~ 75% water along with TSS of ~ 25°B, enriched by reducing sugars. During the normal course of preparing fruit flakes, the pulp is passed over a double drum drier with a steam pressure of 3.5 to 5.0 bar during which the fruit pulp gets stuck, turns brown and bitter. So far no processed product such as fruit cereal flakes from custard apple is available in the market. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention entails to describe a process to prepare cereal flakes from custard apple fruits, overcoming the characteristic problems of discolouration, development of bitterness and off-flavour.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVNEITON:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cereal flakes from custard apple pulp.<br>
In another objective of the present invention, the pregelatinized cereal mixture is mixed with pulp in the required proportion along with sweetening agent and flaking agent may be used for the preparation of fruit cereal flakes.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention, the custard apple cereal flakes comprises custard apple pulp along with adequate quantity of a cereal, a sweetening agent and a flaking agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRD?TION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, a process for preparation of custard apple cereal flakes without discoloration, bitterness and off- flavour, said process comprising:<br>
(a)	obtaining the custard apple pulp,<br>
(b)	characterized in that pregelatinizing a cereal such as a corn flour (6 to 20%) with water in a steam jacketed kettle,<br>
(c)	adding sugar (5-15%), milk powder (0-15%) and calcium carbonate (0.1-0.3%) to gelatinized mixture as obtained in step (b),<br>
(d)	adding custard apple pulp of step (a) to the mixture as obtained in step (c),<br>
(e)	passing the whole mixture through a colloidal mill as obtai9ned in step (d),<br>
(f)	drying the mixture over a double drum drier at a steam pressure of 3.5 to 5 bar at the rate of 3-5 rpm with a gap between the drums from 0.3 to 0.5mm, to obtain custard apple cereal flakes free of discoloration, bitterness and off flavour.<br>
A process of the present invention more particularly involves the following steps<br>
of (a) Obtaining the custard apple pulp; (b) adding additives such as a cereal,<br>
sweetening agent and flaking agent ; (c) adding custard apple pulp of step (a);;<br>
(d) drying the mixture over a double drum drier at a steam pressure of 3.5 to 5<br>
bar at the rate of 3 - 5 rpm to obtain the flakes of acceptable quality.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, it was required to overcome the<br>
problems  of discoloration,  development  of  bitterness  and  off-flavor,  while<br>
processing the pulp.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, custard apple pulp is obtained<br>
from fresh ripe custard apple fruits.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention,    the custard apple pulp is<br>
obtained by scooping the pulp and passing the pulper for separating he seeds.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the cereal used is corn flour.<br>
In a further embodiment, the cereal is gelatinized with water.<br>
In another embodiment, the sweetening agent used is sugar.<br>
In another embodiment, the flaking agent used is calcium carbonate.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the pre-gelatinized cereal is mixed with sugar and<br>
calcium carbonate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the pulp is mixed with the above mixture and passed<br>
through a colloidal mill.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the mixture is dried over a double drum drier at a<br>
steam pressure of 3.5 to 5 bar at the rate of 3 to 5 rpm to obtain the flakes of<br>
acceptable quality.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the fruit cereal flakes<br>
prepared from custard apple is shelf stable at ambient temperature for a period of<br>
not less than 6 months.<br>
Example 1<br>
240 g of corn flour was mixed with 1.440 kg of water and the mixture was heated<br>
in a steam jacketed kettle until the starch gelatinized . To this gelatinized mixture<br>
sugar 300 g and whole milk powder 300 g were mixed followed by custard apple<br>
pulp ( 2 kg) . This hot mixture was further homogenized by passing through the<br>
colloidal mill . The mixture was finally   passed over a drum drier rotating at a<br>
pressure of 4 bar, speed of 4 rpm and a clearance of 0.3 mm to obtain custard<br>
apple cereal flakes.<br>
Example 2<br>
120 g of corn flour was mixed with 720 g of water and the mixture was heated in<br>
a steam jacketed kettle until the starch gelatinized . To this gelatinized mixture of<br>
sugar was added followed by custard apple pulp ( 2 kg) . This hot mixture was<br>
further homogenized by passing through the colloidal mill . The mixture was<br>
finally passed over a drum drier rotating at a pressure of 4 bar, speed of 4 rpm<br>
and a clearance of 0.3 mm to obtain fruit cereal flakes.<br>
Example 3<br>
360 g of corn flour was mixed with 2.180 kg of water and the mixture was heated<br>
in a steam jacketed kettle until the starch gelatinized . To this gelatinized mixture<br>
300 g of sugar and whole milk powder (100 g) were mixed followed by custard<br>
apple pulp (2 kg). This hot mixture was further homogenized by passing through<br>
the colloidal mill . The mixture was finally passed over a drum drier rotating at a<br>
pressure of 4 bar, speed of 4 rpm and a clearance of 0.3 mm to obtain fruit<br>
cereal flakes.<br>
Example 4<br>
240 g of corn flour was mixed with 1.440 kg of water and the mixture was heated<br>
in a steam jacketed kettle until the starch gelatinized . To this gelatinized mixture<br>
sugar 150 g and whole milk powder 100g and calcium carbonate 2 g were mixed<br>
followed   by     custard   apple  pulp  (2  kg)   .  This  hot  mixture  was  further<br>
homogenized by passing through the colloidal mill . The mixture was finally<br>
passed over a drum drier rotating at a pressure of 4 bar, speed of 4 rpm and a<br>
clearance of 0.3 mm to obtain custard apple cereal flakes.<br>
The novelty of the invention involves supplementation of the custard apple with<br>
adequate quantities of the additives and operating the drum drier eventually<br>
to result in flaked product that is free of bitterness, off flavour and discoloration,<br>
particularly     used for consumption as it is or in chilled liquids and semisolid<br>
forms. As such no product is available in the market.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
a) The invention describes for the first time a process for the preparation of custard apple cereal flakes without the problems of discoloration, development of bitterness and off- flavor characteristic of custard apple when heated to a temperature above 55 °C.<br>
b)	The fruit cereal flake prepared represents the value added form of custard apple , of extended storage , to offer to the needs during off season since the fruit availability is sharp seasoned .<br>
c)	Preparation of fruit cereal flakes from custard apple encourages the growers to produce more of the fruit that requires little agronomic care.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
