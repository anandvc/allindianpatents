				<td>SUBSTITUTED 1-PIPERJDIN-4-YL-4-PYRROLIDIN-3-YL-PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS NEUROKININ ANTAGONISTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention concerns substituted 1 -piperidin-4-yl-4-pyrrolidm-3-yl-piperazine derivatives having neurokinm antagonistic activity, in particular NKj antagonistic activity, a combined NK]MK3 antagonistic activity and a combined NKi/NK2/NK3 antagonistic activity, their preparation, compositions comprising them and their use as a medicine, in particular for the treatment of schizophrenia, emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances, visceral pain, neurogenic inflammation, asthma, micturition disorders such as urinary incontinence and nociception.<br>
Background of The Invention<br>
Tachykinins belong to a family of short peptides that are widely distributed in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system (Bertrand and Geppetti, Trends Phai-macol. Sd. 17:255-259 (1996) ; Lundberg, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol 73:908-914 (1995) ; Maggi, Gen. Pharmacol. 26:911-944 (1995) ; Regoli etal., Pharmacol. Rev. 46 (1994)). They share the common C-terminal sequence Phe-Xaa-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2. Tachykinins released from peripheral sensory nerve endings are believed to be involved in neurogenic inflammation. In the spinal cord/central nervous system, tachykinins may play a role in pain transmission/perception and in some autonomic reflexes and behaviors. The three major tachykinins are Substance P (SP), Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB) with preferential affinity for three distinct neurokinin receptor subtypes, termed NKi, NK2, and NK3, respectively. However, functional studies on cloned receptors suggest strong functional cross-interaction between the 3 tachykinins and their corresponding neurokinin receptors (Maggi and Schwartz, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 18: 351-355 (1997)).<br>
Species differences in structure of NKi receptors are responsible for species-related potency differences of NKi antagonists (Maggi, Gen. Pharmacol. 26:911-944 (1995); Regoli et al, Pharmacol. Rev. 46(4):551-599 (1994)). The human NK, receptor closely resembles the NKi receptor of guinea-pigs and gerbils but differs markedly from the NKi receptor of rodents. The development of neurokinin antagonists has led to date to a series of peptide compounds of which might be anticipated that they<br><br>
are metabolically too labile to be employed as pharmaceutically active substances (Longmore J. etaL, DN&amp;P 8(l):5-23 (1995)).<br>
The tachykinins are involved in schizophrenia, depression, (stress-related) anxiety states, emesis, inflammatory responses, smooth muscle contraction and pain perception. Neurokinin antagonists are in development for indications such as emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances, visceral pain, neurogem'c inflammation, asthma, micturition disorders, and nociception. In particular, NKi antagonists have a high therapeutic potential in emesis and depression and NKa antagonists have a high therapeutic potential in asthma treatments. NK^ antagonists seem to play a role in the treatment of pain/inflammation (Giardina, G. et al. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 10(6): 939-960 (2000)) and schizophrenia.<br>
Schizophrenia<br>
The NK3 antagonist SR142801 (Sanofi) was recently shown to have antipsychotic activity in schizophrenic patients without affecting negative symptoms (Arvantis, L. ACNP Meeting, December 2001). Activation of NKi receptors causes anxiety, stressfull events evoke elevated substance P (SP) plasma levels and NKi antagonists are reported to be anxiolytic in several animal models. The NKj antagonist from Merck, MK-869 shows antidepressant effects in major depression, but data were not conclusive due to a high placebo response rate. Moreover, the NKi antagonist from Glaxo-Welcome (S)-GR205,171 was shown to enhance dopamine release in the frontal cortex but not in the striatum (Lejeune et al. Soc. Neurosci, November 2001). It is therefore hypothesized that NKs antagonism in combination with NKi antagonism would be beneficial against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
Anxiety and depression<br>
Depression is one of the most common affective disorders of modem society with a high and still increasing prevalence, particularly in the younger members of the population. The life time prevalence rates of Major depression (MDD, DSM-IV) is currently estimated to be 10-25 % for women and 5-12 % for men, whereby in about 25 % of patients the life time MDD is recurrent, without full inter-episode recovery and superimposed on dysthymic disorder. There is a high co-morbidity of depression with other mental disorders and, particularly in younger population high association with drug and alcohol abuse. In the view of the fact that depression primarily affects the population between 18-44 years of age e.g. the most productive population, it is obvious that it imposes a high burden on individuals, families and the whole society.<br><br>
Among all therapeutic possibilities, the therapy with antidepressants is incontestably the most effective. A large number of antidepressants have been developed and introduced to the market in the course of the last 40 years. Nevertheless, none of the current antidepressants fulfill all criteria of an ideal drug (high therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy, rapid onset of action, completely satisfactory short- and long-term safety, simple and favourable pharmacokinetics) or is without side effects which in one or the other way limits their use in all groups and subgroups of depressed patients.<br>
Since no treatment of the cause of depression exists at present, nor appears imminent, and no antidepressant is effective in more than 60-70 % of patients; the development of a new antidepressant which may circumvent any of the disadvantages of the available drugs is justified.<br>
Several findings indicate involvement of SP in stress-related anxiety states. Central injection of SP induces a cardiovascular response resembling the classical "fight or flight" reaction characterised physiologically by vascular dilatation in skeletal muscles and decrease of mesenteric and renal blood flow. This cardiovascular reaction is accompanied by a behavioural response observed in rodents after noxious stimuli or stress (Oilman and Unger, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 73:885-891 (1995)). In mice, centrally administered NKi agonists and antagonists are anxiogenic and anxiolytic, respectively (Teixeira et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 311:7-14 (1996)). The ability of NKj antagonists to inhibit thumping induced by SP (or by electric shock; Ballard et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 17:255-259 (2001)) might correspond to this antidepressant / anxiolytic activity, since in gerbils thumping plays a role as an alerting or warning signal to conspecifics.<br>
The NK| receptor is widely distributed throughout the limbic system and fear-processing pathways of the brain, including the amygdala, hippocampus, septum, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal grey. Additionally, substance P is released centrally in response to traumatic or noxious stimuli and substance P-associated neurotransmission may contribute to or be involved in anxiety, fear, and the emotional disturbances that accompany affective disorders such as depression and anxiety. In support of this view, changes in substance P content in discrete brain regions can be observed in response to stressful stimuli (Brodin et al., Nenropeptides 26:253-260 (1994)).<br><br>
Central injection of substance P mimetics (agonists) induces a range of defensive behavioural and cardiovascular alterations including conditioned place aversion (Elliott, Exp. Brain. Res. 73:354-356 (1988)), potentiated acoustic startle response (Krase et a!., Behav. Brain. Res. 63:81-88 (1994)), distress vocalisations, escape behaviour (Kramer et al., Science 281:1640-1645 (1998)) and anxiety on the elevated plus maze (Aguiar and Brandao, Physiol Behav. 60:1183-1186(1996)). These compounds did not modify motor performance and co-ordination on the rotarod apparatus or ambulation in an activity cage. Down-regulation of substance P biosynthesis occurs in response to the administration of known anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs (Brodin et al., Neuropeptides 26:253-260 (1994); Shirayama etal, Brain. Res. 739:70-78 (1996)).   Similarly, a centrally administered NKi agonist-induced vocalisation response in guinea-pigs can be antagonised by antidepressants such as imipramine and fluoxetine as well as L-733,060, an NKi antagonist These studies provide evidence suggesting that blockade of central NKi receptors may inhibit psychological stress in a manner resembling antidepressants and anxiolytics (Rupniak and Kramer, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20:1-12 (1999)), but without the side effects of present medications.<br>
Emesis<br>
Nausea and vomiting are among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. These reduce the quality of life and may cause patients to delay or refuse, potentially curative drugs (Kris et al., J. Gin. Oncol., 3:1379-1384(1985)). The incidence, intensity and pattern of emesis is determined by different factors, such as the chemotherapeutic agent, dosage and route of administration. Typically, early or acute emesis starts within the first 4 h after chemotherapy administration, reaching a peak between 4 h and 10 h, and decreases by 12 to 24 h. Delayed emesis (developing after 24 h and continuing until 3-5 days post chemotherapy) is observed with most 'high-emetogenic' chemotherapeutic drugs (level 4 and 5 according to Hesketh et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 15:103 (1997)). ha humans, these 'high-emetogenic' anti-cancer treatments, including cis-platinum, induce acute emesis in &gt; 98% and delayed emesis in 60-90% of cancer patients.<br>
Animal models of chemotherapy such as cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets (Rudd and Naylor, Neuropharmacology 33:1607-1608 (1994) ; Naylor and Rudd, Cancer. Surv. 21:117-135 (1996)) have successfully predicted the clinical efficacy of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Although this discovery led to a successful therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy- and radiation-induced sickness in cancer patients, 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron and granisetron (either or not associated with<br><br>
dexamethasone) are effective in the control of the acute emetic phase (the first 24 h) but can only reduce the development of delayed emesis (&gt; 24 h) with poor efficacy (De Mulder et al, Annuals of Internal Medicine 113:834-840 (1990) ; Roila, Oncology 50:163-167 (1993)). Despite these currently most effective treatments for the prevention of both acute and delayed emesis, still 50% of patients suffer from delayed vomiting and/or nausea (Antiemetic Subcommittee, Annals Oncol. 9:811-8T9 (1998)).<br>
In contrast to 5-HT3 antagonists, NKj antagonists such as CP-99,994 (Piedimonte et al., L. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 266:270-273 (1993)) and aprepitant (also known as MK.-869 or L-754,030 ; Kramer et al., Science 281:1640-1645 (1998); Rupniak and Kramer, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20:1-12 (1999)) have now been shown to inhibit not only the acute but also the delayed phase of cisplatin-induced emesis in animals (Rudd et al.,Br. J. Pharmacol. 119:931-936 (1996) ; Tattersall etal.,Neitropharmacology 39:652-663 (2000)). NKi antagonists have also been demonstrated to reduce 'delayed' emesis in man in the absence of concomitant therapy (Cocquyt et al., Eur. J. Cancer 37:835-842 (2001); Navari eta!., N. Engl. L. Med. 340:190-195 (1999)). When administered together with dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonists, moreover, NK] antagonists (such as MK-869 and CJ-11,974, also known as Ezlopitant) have been shown to produce additional effects in the prevention of acute emesis (Campos et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 19:1759-1767 (2001); Hesketh etal, Clin. Oncol. 17:338-343 (1999)).<br>
Central neurokinin NKi receptors play a major role in the regulation of emesis. NK] antagonists are active against a wide variety of emetic stimuli (Watson et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 115:84-94 (1995) ; Tattersall et al., Neuropharmacol 35:1121-1129 (1996) ; Megens etal., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 302:696-709 (2002)). The compounds are suggested to act by blocking central NKi-receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius. Apart from NKi antagonism, CNS penetration is thus a prerequisite for the antiemetic activity of these compounds. Loperamide-induced emesis in ferrets can be used as a fast and reliable screening model for the antiemetic activity of NKi antagonists. Further evaluation of their therapeutic value in the treatment of both the acute and the delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis has been demonstrated in the established ferret model (Rudd etal., Br. J. Pharmacol. 119:931-936 (1994)). This model studies both 'acute' and 'delayed' emesis after cisplatin and has been validated in terms of its sensitivity to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, glucocorticoids (Sam et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 417:231-237 (2001)) and other pharmacological challenges. It is unlikely that any future anti-emetic would find clinical acceptance unless successfully treating both the 'acute' and 'delayed' phases of emesis.<br><br>
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<br>
Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience impaired quality of life, and utilise health care resources extensively as they seek better "solutions" (including unnecessary repeated investigations or even surgery). Although these patients suffer from a 'benign' disorder (in other words, they will never die or develop significant complications), they nevertheless cause a significant economic burden by extensive health care resource utilisation, and absence from work.<br>
A reasonable number of pre-clinical publications over the role of NKi receptors in visceral pain has been published. Using NKi receptor knockout mice and NKi antagonists in animal models, different groups have demonstrated the important role played by the NKi receptor in hyperalgesia and visceral pain. The distribution of NKi receptors and substance P favours a major role in visceral rather than in somatic pain. Indeed more than 80% of visceral primary afferent contain substance P compared with only 25% skin afferents. NKi receptors are also involved in gastrointestinal motility (Tonini et al., Gastroenterol. 120:938-945 (2001); Okano et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298:559-564 (2001)). Because of this dual role in both gastrointestinal motility and in nociception, NKi antagonists are considered to have potential to ameliorate symptoms in IBS patients.<br>
Background prior art<br>
Compounds containing the l-piperidin-4-yl-piperazinyl moiety were published in WO 97/16440-A1, published May 9, 1997 by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. for use as substance P antagonists, in WO 02/32867, published April 25, 2002 by Glaxo Group Ltd. for their special advantages as neurokinin antagonists (more specifically were disclosed 4-piperazin-l-yl-piperidine-l-carboxylic acid amide derivatives), in WO 01/30348-A1, published May 03,2001 by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., for use as substance P antagonists for influencing the circadian timing system, and in WO 02/062784-A1, published August 15, 2002 by Hoffmann-La Roche AG for use as neurokinin-1 antagonists.<br>
The compounds of the present invention differ from the compounds of the prior art in the substitution of the piperazinyl moiety, being a substituted pyrrolidinyl moiety as well as in their improved ability as potent, orally and centrally active neurokinin antagonists with therapeutic value, especially for the treatment of schizophrenia, emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances,<br><br>
visceral pain, neurogenic inflammation, asthma, micturition disorders such as urinary incontinence and nociception.<br>

In the framework of this application, alkyl is defined as amonovalent straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methylpropyl, l,l-dimethylethyl,pentyl, hexyl; alkyl further defines a monovalent cyclic saturated hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, methylcyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The definition of alkyl also comprises an alkyl radical that is optionally substituted on one or more carbon atoms with one or more phenyl, halo, cyano, oxo, hydroxy, formyl and amino radicals, for example hydroxyalkyl, in particular hydroxymethyl and hydroxyethyl and polyhaloalkyl, in particular difluoromethyl and trifluoromethyl.<br>
In the framework of this application, halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
In the framework of this application, with "compounds according to the invention" is meant a compound according to the general Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the //-oxide form thereof and a prodrug thereof.<br>
In the framework of this application, especially in the moiety Alka-Y-Alkb in Formula (I), when two or more consecutive elements of said moiety denote a covalent bond, then a single covalent bond is denoted. For example, when Alk" and Y denote both a covalent bond and Alkb is -CH2-, then the moiety Alk"-Y-Alkb denotes -CH2-. Similary, if Alk°, Y and Alkb each denote a covalent bond and L denotes H, then the moiety Alka-Y-Alkb-L denotes -H.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salts forms that the compounds according to Formuk (I) are able to form. Said salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid,<br>
succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclarnic acid,, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salts forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkah'ne metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, TV-methyl-D-glucarnine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said salts forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates that the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The TV-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called TV-oxide, particularly those TV-oxides wherein one or more tertiary nitrogens (e.g of the piperazinyl or pyrrolidinyl radical) are TV-oxidized. Such TV-oxides can easily be obtained by a skilled person without any inventive skills and they are obvious alternatives for the compounds according to Formula (I) since these compounds are metabolites, which are formed by oxidation in the human body upon uptake . As is generally known, oxidation is normally the first step involved in drug metabolism ( Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 1977, pages 70- 75). As is also generally known, the metabolite form of a compound can also be administered to a human instead of the compound per se, with possibly the same effects.<br>
The compounds according to the invention possess at least 2 oxydizable nitrogens (tertiary amines moieties). It is therefore highly likely that TV-oxides will form in the human metabolism.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide<br>
forms following art-known procedures for converting a bivalent nitrogen into its TV-oxide form. Said //-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of Formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboper-oxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarbo-peroxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-bnty\ hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric forms that the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms having that designation, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. R* and S* each indicate optically pure stereogenic centers with undetermined absolute configuration. If "a" and "P" are used: the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system (hydrogen atom in compounds according to Formula (I)) relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "P", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
Compounds according to Formula (I) and some of the intermediate compounds have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the JV-oxide form thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula — COOR*, where R" is a Chalky!, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br><br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, C^alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, C|.«alkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers that can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by<br><br>
reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound would be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
Pharmacology<br>
Substance P and other tachykinins are involved in a variety of biological actions such as pain transmission (nociception), neurogenic inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, plasma protein extravasation, vasodilation, secretion, mast cell degranulation, and also in activation of the immune system. A number of diseases are deemed to be engendered by activation of neurokinin receptors, in particular the NKi<br>
receptor, by excessive release of substance P and other neurokinins in particular cells such as cells in the neuronal plexi of the gastrointestinal tract, unmyelinated primary sensory afferent neurons, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and nonneuronal cell types (DN&amp;P 8(l):5-23 (1995) and Longmore J. et al,"Neurokinin Receptors" Pharmacological Reviews 46(4):551-599 (1994)).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of neurokinin-mediated effects, in particular those mediated via the NKj, NK.2 and NK3 receptor, and may therefore be described as neurokinin antagonists, especially as substance P antagonists, as may be indicated in vitro by the antagonism of substance P-induced relaxation of pig coronary arteries. The binding affinity of the present compounds for the human, guinea-pig and gerbil neurokinin receptors may also be determined in vitro in a receptor binding test using ^H-substance-P as radioligand. The subject compounds also show substance-P antagonistic activity in vivo as may be evidenced by, for instance, the antagonism of substance P-induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs, or the antagonism of drug-induced emesis in ferrets (Watson et al.,Br. J. Pharmacol. 115:84-94 (1995)).<br>
In view of their capability to antagonize the actions of tachykinins by blocking the neurokinin receptors, and in particular by blocking the NK], NK2 and NK3 receptor, the<br>
compounds according to the invention are useful as a medicine, in particular in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of tachykinin-mediated conditions.

The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention, in particular a compound according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the A'-oxide form thereof and a prodrug thereof<br>
The compounds according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the A'-oxide form thereof and the prodrugs<br>
thereof, or any subgroup or combination thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, by parenteral injection or by inhalation. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated<br>
tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Since the compounds according to the invention are potent orally, mainly centrally active NK], NK|/NK3 and NKi/NK2/NK3 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds for administration orally are especially advantageous.<br>

Said reductive A^-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol or toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or triacetoxy borohydride.   In case a borohydride is used as a reducing agent, it may be convenient to use a complex-forming agent such as, for example, titanium(IV)isopropylate as described in J. Org. diem, 1990, 55, 2552-2554. Using said complex-forming agent may also result in an improved cisi'trans ratio in favour of the trans isomer. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydrogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a dehydrating agent to the reaction mixture such as, for example, aluminium fer/-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. Stirring and optionally elevated temperatures and/or pressure may enhance the rate of the reaction.<br>

hi this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and chromatography.<br>
Especially advantageous is the preparation of a final compound according to Formula (1) according to the previously mentioned reaction scheme in which the Alk-Y-Alk-L-moiety is benzyl, thus giving rise to a compound according to Formula (I) in which the Alk-Y-Alk-L-moiety is benzyl. Said final compound is pharmacologically active and can be converted into a final compound according to the invention in which the Alk-Y-Alk-L-moiety is hydrogen by reductive hydrogenation using e.g. hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. The resulting final compound according to the invention can then be converted into other compounds according to Formula (I) by art-known transformations, e.g. acylation and alkylation.<br>
In particular, the final compounds of Formula (T) can be prepared by reacting a final compound of Formula (I1) with an intermediate compound of Formula (V) wherein W* is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy. The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobutylketone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between room temperature and reflux temperature. (Figure Remove)<br>
Alternatively, the final compounds of Formula (I") can also be prepared by reacting a final compound of Formula (I1) with a carboxylic acid of Formula (VI). The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, in the presence of a suitable base such as, for<br>
example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine and in the presence of an activator, such as e.g. DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), CDI (carbonyldiimidazole) and EDCI (l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide.HCl). Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between room temperature and reflux temperature.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In particular, the final compounds of Formula (Ib) can be prepared by reacting a final compound of Formula (I1) with a compound of Formula (VII) wherein W^ is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy. The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobutylketone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between room temperature and reflux temperature.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
The final compounds of Formula (Ic) and Formula (I*1) can be prepared either by alkylation or reductive amination of a final compound of Formula (I1) with either a compound of Formula (VIII) or (IX) wherein W^ in Formula (VIII) is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy and wherein Alk in Formula (Id) is defined as -CH2-Alk. The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an<br>
alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobutylketone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between room temperature and reflux temperature.  (Figure Remove)  <br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediates are known compounds and are commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, intermediate compounds of Formula (II) may be prepared by reductively Af-alkylating an intermediate compound of Formula (XI) with an intermediate compound of Formula (XII) in which W4 is a benzyl radical, after which the resulting compound is subsequently reduced to yield an intermediate compound according to Formula (II). Said reductive W-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol, toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or triacetoxy borohydride. In case a borohydride is used as a reducing agent, it may be convenient to use a complex-forming agent such as, for example, titanium(IV)iso-propylate as described in J. Org. Chem, 1990, 55, 2552-2554. Using said complex-forming agent may also result in an improved cis/trans ratio in favour of the trans isomer. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydrogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a<br><br>
dehydrating agent to the reaction mixture such as, for example, aluminium terf-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. Stirring and optionally elevated temperatures and/or pressure may enhance the rate of the reaction.<br>

D. Pharmacological example<br>
Example D.I : Binding experiment for h-NKj. h-NK? and h-NK? receptors The compounds according to the invention were investigated for interaction with various neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels and transporter binding sites using the radioligand binding technique. Membranes from tissue homogenates or from cells, expressing the receptor or transporter of interests, were incubated with a radioactively labelled substance ([3H]- or [125I] ligand) to label a particular receptor. Specific receptor binding of the radioligand was distinguished from the non-specific membrane labelling by selectively inhibiting the receptor labelling with an unlabelled drug (the blank), known to compete with the radioligand for binding to the receptor sites. Following incubation, labelled membranes were harvested and rinsed with excessive cold buffer to remove non-bound radioactivity by rapid filtration under suction. Membrane beomd radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter and results were expressed in counts per minute (cpm).<br>
The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and tested at 10 concentrations ranging from l(r10tol(r5M.<br>
The ability of the compounds according to the invention to displace [3H]-Substance P from cloned human h-NKi receptors expressed in CHO cells, to displace [3H]-SR-48968 from cloned human h-NK2 receptors expressed in Sf9 cells, and to displace [3H]-SR-142801 from cloned human h-NK3 receptors expressed in CHO cells was evaluated.<br>
The receptor binding values (pICso) for the h-NKi ranges for all compounds according to the invention between 10 and 6.<br>
Example D.2 : Signal transduction (ST)<br>
This test evaluates in vitro functional NKi antagonistic activity. For the measurements of intracellular Ca4"1" concentrations the cells were grown on 96-well (black wall/transparent bottom) plates from Costar for 2 days until they reached confluence. The cells were loaded with 2 fiM Fluo3 in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mM probenecid for 1 h at 37°C. They were washed 3x with a Krebs buffer (140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2x6H20, 5 mM KC1, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES; 1.25 mM CaCl2; pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mM probenecid and 0.1 % BSA (Ca^-buffer). The cells were preincubated with a concentration range of antagonists for 20 min at RT and Ca44-signals after addition of the agonists were measured in a Fluorescence Image Plate Reader (FL1PR from Molecular Devices, Crawley, England). The peak of the Ca*-<br><br>
transient was considered as the relevant signal and the mean values of corresponding wells were analysed as described below.<br>
The sigmoidal dose response curves were analysed by computerised curve-fitting, using the GraphPad Program. The ECso-value of a compound is the effective dose showing 50 % of maximal effect. For mean curves the response to the agonist with the highest potency was normalised to 100 %. For antagonist responses the IC50-value was calculated using non-linear regression.<br>
The pIC5o data for the signal transduction testing for a representative selection of compounds are presented in Table 11. The last colums indicates - without being limited thereto - for which action the compounds might be most suitable. Ofcourse, since for some neurokinin receptors no data was determined, it is obvious that these compounds might be attributed to another suitable use.<br>
