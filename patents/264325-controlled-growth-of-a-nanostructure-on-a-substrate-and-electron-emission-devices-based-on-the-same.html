CONTROLLED GROWTH OF A NANOSTRUCTURE ON A SUBSTRATE, AND<br>
ELECTRON EMISSION DEVICES BASED ON THE SAME<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority of Swedish provisional application serial<br>
no. 0500926-1, filed April 25, 2005, and of Swedish provisional application serial no. 0501888-2,<br>
filed August 25, 2005, and to U.S. provisional application serial no. 60/772,449, filed February<br>
10, 2006, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to nanostructures and methods for their growth.<br>
The present invention more particularly relates to methods of controlling the growth of<br>
nanostructures such as carbon nanofibers which enables manufacture of electron emission based<br>
devices such as electron beam writers and Held emission displays.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Relentless efforts at miniaturization are bringing traditional CMOS devices to the limit<br>
where the device characteristics are governed by quantum phenomena; in such regimes, perfect<br>
control is impossible to achieve. This has engendered a need for finding alternative new materials<br>
to fabricate devices that will possess at least the same or even better performance than existing<br>
CMOS devices but with greater control.<br>
[0004] The miniaturization of CMOS devices has hitherto been governed by a trend—often<br>
called Moore's law— in which electronic components shrink in size by half every 30 months.<br>
The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (TTRS) has established a projected<br>
growth curve according to this model The demands for speed, high integration level, high<br>
performance and low production costs attendant on such a rate of progress are very stringent<br>
Consequently, the problems associated with the physical and electrical characteristics of<br>
traditional materials used for making devices have escalated. Hence there is a need to search for<br>
alternative solutions to the problems that will ultimately impede the progress of silicon technology<br>
in the immediate future. This means that devising innovative material and process solutions is<br>
critical to sustaining the projected rate of growth.<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0005] The choice of new materials is however limited by factors such as compatibility with<br>
existing production methods, reproducibility of manufacture and cost Some problems that<br>
existing technology materials have faced are as follows.<br>
[0006] High power consumption due to leakage current: currently, the device performance is<br>
degraded due to high leakage current through gate oxide (which is very thin). This in turn<br>
increases the leakage current in the of: state, and hence increases power consumption, which, in<br>
turn reduces the life time of a battery.<br>
[0007] Poor performance of Cu interconnects: due to its low resistivity, copper is used for<br>
making interconnects that are used for connecting various components to one another, as well as<br>
devices and circuits with the outside world. Due to the dramatic reduction in the size of the<br>
components, interconnects based on copper material are now showing poor performance in terms<br>
of current carrying capacity and lifetime of the wires. This in turn reduces the lifetime of a<br>
processor. No solution currently exists for interconnects that will efficiently connect the devices<br>
in a circuit with those outside of the circuit, in time to meet the projected demand for current<br>
density over the next several years.<br>
[0008] Demand for high aspect ratio structures: today the aspect ratio of contact holes for<br>
interconnects in DRAM staked capacitors has reached 12:1 and is expected to increase to 23:1 by<br>
the year 2016. Creating such high aspect ratio contacts with straight walls poses substantial<br>
technological challenges, not least because void-free filling with metals (also known as vias) of<br>
such high aspect ratio features is extremely difficult.<br>
[0009] High heat dissipation: modem microprocessors generate inordinate amounts ofheat.<br>
Heat dissipation has been increasing steadily as the transistor count and clock frequency of<br>
computer processors has increased. In particular, for example, copper interconnects of the sizes<br>
required for current and future devices generate so much heat that their electrical resistance is<br>
increased, thereby leading to a decreased capacity to carry current. However a practical solution<br>
for cooling of such systems which will not eventually exceed the power budget for processors has<br>
yet to be round.<br>
[00101 In short, for all these reasons, it has become necessary to search for alternative<br>
materials and processing technology.<br>
[0011] Carbon nanostructures, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) andnanofibers, are<br>
considered to be some of the most promising candidates for future developments in nano-<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
electronics, nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), sensors, contact electrodes, nanophotonics,<br>
and nano-biotechnology. This is due principally to their one dimensional nature, and their unique<br>
electrical, optical and mechanical properties. In contrast to the fulleren.es, such as C60 and C70,<br>
whose principal chemistry is based on attaching specific functionalities thereby giving rise to<br>
specific properties, CNTs offer an almost limitless amount of variation through design and<br>
manufacture of tubes of different diameters, pitches, and lengths. Furthermore, whereas the<br>
fullerenes offer the possibility of making a variety of discrete molecules with numerous specific<br>
properties, carbon nanotubes provide the possibility to make molecular-scale components that<br>
have excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, and strength. (See, e.g., Nanoelectronics and<br>
Information Technology, R. Waser (Ed.), Wiley-VCH, 2003, at chapter 19.)<br>
[00121 Carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers have been considered for both active devices<br>
and as interconnect technology at least because their electrical and thermal properties and their<br>
strength. For example, the high electron mobility of carbon nanotubes (79,000 cmVVs) surpasses<br>
that of state-of-the-art MOSFET devices (see, e.g., Durkop, T., et al., Nemo Letters, 4(1), 35,<br>
(2004)). Furthermore, the extremely high current carrying capacity of carbon nanotubes (1010<br>
A/cm2) (see, eg., Wei, B. Q., et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 79(8), 1172, (2001)), when compared with<br>
copper interconnects (~ 106 A/cm2), means that carbon nanotubes potentially possess the solution<br>
to the severe problems for interconnects projected in ITRS.<br>
[00131 The anisotropic thermal conductivity of nanotubes/nanofibers (6,000 W/Km) (see, e.g.,<br>
Hoenlien, W., et al., IEEE Trans. Campon. and Packaging Tech., 27(4), 629, (2004)) is also<br>
exceptionally promising for solving problems of heat dissipation.<br>
[0014] Finally, the high E-modulus (representing the strength of a material) of individual<br>
nanotubes (as high as 1 TPa) has made them a good choice far both composite materials and for<br>
nanoelectromechanical devices.<br>
[0015] In general, it is highly desirable to fabricate electronic devices that are compatible with<br>
existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication techniques. A<br>
prerequisite for exploring CNTs in an industrial process is to be able to control mass production of<br>
devices with high reproducibility. Due to high purity and high yield, chemical vapor, deposition<br>
(CVD) is a popular and advantageous growth method that offers the potential to grow nanotubes<br>
at an exact location with control over their length, diameter, shape and orientation.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0016] Hence for many electronic, nanoelectromechanical systems and interconnect<br>
applications the integration possibilities of carbon nanostructures into existing CMOS-based<br>
electronic industrial manufacturing processes is expected to be a ground breaking technological<br>
breakthrough. However, there are many engineering and materials issues inherent to CMOS-<br>
compatible device fabrication processes that need to be addressed before such integration can take<br>
place. Solutions to these issues have so far been long-awaited.<br>
[0017] For instance, there are problems related to growth of nanostructures. Although<br>
numerous techniques have been developed aad demonstrated to produce carbon based<br>
nanostructures, all possess drawbacks regarding mass production and integration into existing<br>
industry manufacturing processes. Prominent drawbacks are: (a) control over predictable<br>
morphology with either semiconducting or metallic properties, (b) precise localization of the<br>
grown individual structures, and (c) predictable electrical properties at the interface between the<br>
grown nanostructures and the substrate. There is no known single solution to solve all the<br>
aforementioned drawbacks. The most prominent techniques for synthesizing carbon<br>
nanostructures include arc discharge (see, e.g., Iijima, S.,Nature, 354,56, (1991); and<br>
Kratschmer, W.; Lamb, L. D.; Fosuropoulos, K.; Huffinan, D. R., Nature, 347,354, (1990)), laser<br>
vaporization (see, e.g., Kroto, H. W.; Heath, J. R.; O'Brien, S. C; Curl, R. F.; Smalley, R. E.<br>
Nature, 318,162, (1985)), catalytic chemical-vapor deposition (CCVD), also referred to as CVD,<br>
(Cassell, A. M.; Raymakers, J. A.; Jing, K.; Hongjie, D.s J. Phys.Chem. B, 103, (31), (1999)), and<br>
catalytic plasma enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (C-PECVD) (Cassell, A. M.; Qi, Y.;<br>
Cruden, B. A.; Jun, L; Sarrazin, P. C.; Hou Tee, N.; Jie, H-; Meyyappan, M.tNanotechnology,<br>
15(1), 9, (2004); and Meyyappan, M; Delzeit, L.; Casscll, A.; Hash, D., Plasma Sources, Science<br>
and Technology, 12(2), 205, (2003)). Due to high purity and high yield, chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD) is a popular and advantageous growth method, and indeed, among all of the<br>
known growth techniques, CMOS compatibility has been demonstrated only for me CCVD<br>
method. (See, Tseng, et al. (Tseng, Y.-C; Xuan, P.; Javey, A.; Malloy, R.; Wang, Q.; Bokor, J.;<br>
Dai, H. Nano Left. 4(1), 123-127, (2004)) where a monolithic integration of nanotube devices was<br>
performed on n-channel semiconductor (NMOS) circuitry.)<br>
[0018] There are specific problems related to control of the properties of grown materials.<br>
Even though numerous different alternative growth methods exist for growing carbon<br>
nanostructures, controlling the interface properties between the nanostructures and the substrates,<br>
the body of the nanostructures, and the tip of the nanostructures are not yet demonstrated to be<br>
well controlled by utilizing a single method of growth.<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0019] CVD typically employs a metal catalyst to facilitate carbon nanostructure growth. The<br>
main roles of the catalyst are to break bonds in the carbon carrying species and to absorb carbon at<br>
its surface and to reform graphitic planes through diffusion of carbon through or around an<br>
interface (see, e.g., Kim, M. S.; Rodriguez, N. M.; Baker, R. T. K.,Journal of Catalysis, 131, (1),<br>
60, (1991); and Melechko, A. V.; Merkubv, V. I.; McKnight, T. E.; Guillorn, M. A.; Klein, K, L.;<br>
Lowndes, D. H.; Simpson,M. L.,J App. Phys., 97(4), 41301, (2005)).<br>
[0020] However, the growth of nanotubes is usually carried out on silicon or other<br>
semiconducting substrates. Growth from such metal catalysts on conducting metal substrates or<br>
metal underlayers is almost lacking. This is because it has been found that it is hard to make a<br>
good contact between a growing nanostracture and a conducting substrate with good quality<br>
grown nanostructures in terms of control over diameter, length and morphology. Nevertheless, for<br>
making CMOS-compatible structures, it is necessary to use a conducting substrate. In particular,<br>
this is because a metal substrate, or base layer, acts as bottom electrode for electrical connection to<br>
the nanostructures.<br>
[0021] Nevertheless, growth, of nanostructures on CMOS compatible conducting substrates<br>
has proved to be far from trivial, at least because different metals require different conditions, and<br>
also because it has proven difficult to control the properties of the nanostructures grown on such<br>
substrates with predictable control over diameter, length and morphology of the grown structures<br>
and with predictable interface properties between the nanostructures and title substrate,<br>
[0022] A method for producing arrays of carbon nanotubes on a metal underlayer, with a<br>
silicon buffer layer between the metal underlayer and a catalyst layer, is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2004/0101468 by Liu ef al. According to Liu, the buffer layer<br>
prevents catalyst from diffusing into the substrate and also prevents the metal underlayer from<br>
reacting with carbon source gas to, undesirably, form amorphous carbon instead of carbon<br>
nanostructures. In Liu, the process involves, inconveniently, annealing the substrate in air for 10<br>
hours at 300-400 °C to form catalyst particles, via oxidation of the catalyst layer, prior to forming<br>
the nanostructures. Each catalyst particle acts as a seed to promote growth of a nanostructure.<br>
The method of Liu, however, does not permit control of the composition or properties of the<br>
nanostructures and the nanotubes produced are curved and disorganized.<br>
[0023] An additional goal is fabrication of carbon based nano-electro mechanical structures<br>
(NEMS). Extensive theoretical analysis on two- terminal and three-terminal carbon based NEMS<br>
(C-NEMS) structures were performed by Dequesnes et al. (Dequesnes, M.; Rotkin, S.V.; Aluru,<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
N. R., Nanotechnology, 13(1), 120, (2002)) and Kinaret et al. (Kinaret, J. M.; Nord, T.; Viefers,<br>
S., Applied Physics letters, 82(8), 1287, (2003)) respectively. The model developed by Kinaret et<br>
al. for three-terminal MEMS device consists of a conducting carbon nanotube (CNT) placed on a<br>
terraced Si substrate and connected to a fixed source electrode which they have called it<br>
"nanorelay." Recently Lee et al. ( Lee, S. W. L, et al, Nano Letters, 4(10), 2027, (2004)) have<br>
demonstrafsd the characteristics of such three terminal nanorelay structures experimentally.<br>
However, the experimental approach by Lee et al. for fabricating such devices is time consuming<br>
and the technology is heavily dependent on the sonicated CNF solutions which usually do not<br>
possess any control over the length and the diameter of the CNF: the functional part of the device.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to develop a technology for fabricating such structures with predictable<br>
behavior.<br>
[0024] Accordingly, there is a need for a method of growing carbon nanostructures on a metal<br>
substrate in such a way that various properties of the nanostructures can be controlled.<br>
[0025] The discussion of the background to the invention herein is included to explain the<br>
context of the invention. This is not to be taken as an admission that any of the material referred<br>
to was published, known, or part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Overview<br>
[0090] The present invention is directed to processes for making nanostructures, singly, or in<br>
arrays, on a conducting substrate. In particular, the processes of the present invention permit<br>
choices of material, and sequences of materials, lying between the substrate and the base of the<br>
nanostructure, to control various properties of the interface between the nanostructure and the<br>
substrate, properties of the body of the nanostructure, and the composition of the tip of the<br>
nanostructure. It is preferable that the nanostructures form columns that grow perpendicularly, or<br>
almost perpendicularly up from the substrate. However, this does not exclude the possibility to<br>
grow the nanostructures at other angles from the substrate such as on the substrate, (i.e.., parallel<br>
to the substrate), or at an inclined angle other than 90°.<br>
[0091] Accordingly, the present invention relates to: a method of growing/depositing<br>
nanostructures utilizing existing CMOS technology; a. method of growing nanostructuxes on<br>
CMOS compatible conducting substrates and glass substrate and flexible polymer substrates used<br>
in areas that utilize thin film, technology; a method to control the chemical interactions and hence<br>
controlling the end chemical compounds in the nanostructures; and a method to control the<br>
chemical reactions by having multilayer material stacks consisting of at least oneintermediate<br>
layer between the substrate and a catalyst layer, wherein the intermediate layer is hot of the same<br>
material as either the catalyst layer or the conducting substrate.<br>
[0092] The present invention therefore provides a method for integrating nanostructures into<br>
CMOS technology and to achieve downscaling, higher component density and new functionality<br>
in, e.g., integrated circuits.<br>
[0093] The ability to grow nanostructures on different metal underlayers (metal substrates) is<br>
important for several other reasons, including the fact that the identity of the metal is an additional<br>
parameter that can be tuned to control the parameters of grown nanostructures such as height,<br>
diameter, density, etc., and because different metal work functions can be exploited to control the<br>
height of the Schottky barrier between the metal underlayers and the nanostructures, thus<br>
permitting control over device functionality.<br>
[0094] By controlling the choice of material stacks and the sequence of different materials, the<br>
layers in a stack can be used to control properties of the grown/deposited nanostructures.<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0095] In particular, by varying the materials and sequence of the materials the properties of<br>
the following can be controlled: the interface between the nanostructure and the substrate can be<br>
controlled to have properties that include, but are not limited to, Ohmic barriers, Schottky<br>
contacts, or controllable tunneling barriers); the body of the nanostructures; and the chemical<br>
composition of the tip of the nanostructures.<br>
[0096] By controlling the properties of these three parts (the interface, the body, and the tip),<br>
different structures, components and devices can be fabricated which can be used in different<br>
applications. By controlling the properties of these three parts in combination with different<br>
structures, components and devices, different functionality can be achieved. For example, the tip<br>
of the nanostructure can be tailored to have a particular chemical property, or composition. Such<br>
tailoring permits the tip of the nanostructure to be functionalized in different ways.<br>
Nanostructures<br>
[0097] The nanostructures formed by the methods of the present invention are preferably<br>
made predominantly from carbon. However, other chemical compositions are consistent with the<br>
methods of the present invention and are further described herein.<br>
[0098] Nanostructures as referred to herein, encompass, carbon nanotubes, nanotubes<br>
generally, carbon nanostructures, other related structures such as nanofibers, nanoropes, and<br>
nanowires, as those terms are understood in the art.<br>
[0099] By carbon nanotube (CNT), is meant a hollow cylindrical molecular structure,<br>
composed principally of covalently bonded sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in a continuous network<br>
of edge-fused 6-membered rings, and having a diameter of from about 0.5 to about 50 nm.<br>
Typically a nanotube is capped at one or both ends by a hemispherical carbon cap having fused 5-<br>
and 6-membered rings of carbon atoms, though the nanotubes of the present invention are not<br>
necessarily capped. Carbon nanotubes may be, in length, from a few nanometers, to tens or<br>
hundreds of microns, to several centimeters.<br>
[0100] The typical make-up of a CNT is analogous to a sheet of graphitic carbon wrapped on<br>
itself to form a closed surface, without any dangling bonds. Thus, CNT's typically consist of a<br>
closed network of 6-membered carbon rings, fused together at their edges. Most CNT s have a<br>
chirality that can be envisaged as arising if a sheet of graphitic carbon is sheared slightly before it<br>
is bended back on itself to form a tuba. CNT's of any chirality may be formed by the present<br>
invention. It is also consistent with the present invention, however, that the carbon nanotubes also<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
may have a number of 5-membered tings, fused amongst the 6-membered rings, as is found in, for<br>
example, the related "ftulerene" molecules, and where necessary to, for example, relieve 3train or<br>
introduce a kink. Carbon nanotubes have electrical properties that range from metallic to<br>
semiconductors, depending at least in part on their cbirality.<br>
[0101] By suitable choice of materials lying in between the substrate and the base of the<br>
nanostructure, and their sequence, the morphology of the nanostructure that is formed can be<br>
talked. Such nanostructures include, but are not limited to, nanotubes, both single-walled and<br>
multi-walled, nanofibers, or a nanowire. Such tailoring can arise from, e.g., the choice of texture<br>
of the catalyst layer that is positioned between the substrate and the nanostructure.<br>
[0102] Carbon nanotubes made by the methods of the present invention may be of the single-<br>
walled variety (SWCNT's), having a cylinder formed from a single layer of carbon atoms such as<br>
a single layer of graphitic carbon, or of the multi-walled variety (MWCNT's), having two or more<br>
concentrically arranged sheaths of single layers. MWCNT's may consist of either concentric<br>
cylinders of SWCNTs or stacks of frusto-conical shaped single-walled structures,<br>
[0103] A carbon nanofiber (CNF) is typically not hollow, but has a "herring-bone" or<br>
"bamboo"-like structure in which discrete segments of carbon fuse together one after another.<br>
The typical diameters ranges from 5 nm to 100 nm. A conical segment of catalyst containing<br>
material is typically found at the tip of such a nanofiber. Carbon nanofibers are thus not<br>
crystalline and have different electrical conductivity from carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanofibers<br>
are effective interconnects in electronic circuits because they support electric current densities of<br>
around 1010 A/cm2. Carbon nanofibers thus have a higher atomic density, given by numbers of<br>
carbon atoms per unit volume of fiber, than the, hollow, nanotubes.<br>
[0104] Carbon nanofibers made according to the present invention also can be generally<br>
straight, and have a conical angle 
the base of the nanostructure is broader than its tip. Since an angle θ ≈ tanθ when θ is small, the<br>
conical angle ≈ (wb - wt)/2 L, where wb, and wt are the width of respectively the base and the tip of<br>
the nanostructure, and L is its length, measured along its axis.<br>
[0105] A carbon nanorope has a diameter in the range 20-200 nm, and thus is typically larger<br>
in diameter than a carbon nanotube. A carbon nanorope is typically constructed by intertwining<br>
several nanotubes in a manner akin to the way in which a macroscopic rope consists of several<br>
strands of fiber bundled together. The various nanotubes in a nanorope may be twisted around<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
one another or may line up substantially parallel to one another; the individual nanotubes are held<br>
together principally by van der Waals forces. Such, farces, although individually weaker than a<br>
covalent bond between a pair of atoms, are in the aggregate very strong when summed over all of<br>
the pairs of atoms in adjacent tubes<br>
The Interface<br>
[0106] According to the present invention, by suitable choice of materials and their sequence,<br>
the interface between the base of the nanostructure and the substrate can be chosen to have various<br>
electrical properties. For example, it can be chosen to be an ohmic contact, a Schottky barrier, or<br>
a controllable tunnel barrier.<br>
[0107] An Ohmic contact is a metal-semiconductor contact with very low resistance,<br>
independent of applied voltage (and which may therefore be represented by a constant resistance).<br>
The current flowing through an ohmic contact is in direct proportion to an applied voltage across<br>
the contact as would be the case for an ohmic conductor such as a metal. To form an ohmic<br>
contact, the metal and semiconductor must be selected such that there is no potential barrier<br>
formed at the interface (or so that the potential barrier is so thin that charge carriers can readily<br>
tunnel through it).<br>
[0108] A Schottky barrier is a semiconductor-metal interface in which the metal-<br>
semiconductor contact is used to form a potential barrier.<br>
[0109] A tunnel barrier is a barrier through which a charge carrier, such as an electron or a<br>
hole, can tunnel.<br>
[0110] FIG. 2 is a flow-chart that describes in overview a process of making nanostructures on<br>
a substrate according to the present invention. First, one chooses a stack material, step 10. Then,<br>
a stack is created from the chosen materials, step 20, for example by deposition, sputtering or<br>
evaporation on to a substrate. Then, nanostructures are grown on the stack, step 30, for example<br>
in a growth/deposition chamber. Finally, the structure is incorporated into a device, by one or<br>
more additional fabrication techniques, step 40.<br>
[0111] Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is the preferred method for growth of<br>
nanostructures according to the present invention. However, there are different kinds of CVD<br>
methods that can be used, e.g., thermal CVD, PECVD, RPECVD, MOCVD (metallo-organic<br>
CVD), etc. It would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, that other variants of CVD<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
are compatible with the present invention and that the practice of the present invention is not<br>
limited to those methods previously referenced<br>
[0112] It is preferable that the substrate for use with the present invention is a conducting<br>
substrate. Accordingly, it is preferably a metal, or a metal alloy substrate.<br>
[0113] By the methods of the present invention, step 10 can influence the properties of the<br>
nanostructures that are grown. In particular, the nature and properties of the nanostructure are<br>
governed by the nature and extent of interdiffusion of the layers between the substrate and the<br>
nanostructure. Permitting mterdiffusion can control the diameter and morphology of the<br>
nanostructure, the number of nanotubes that grow per unit area of substrate, as well as the density<br>
of a nanostructure, and the electrical properties of the interface. On the other hand, using<br>
materials that impede diffusion between the substrate and the carbon nanostructure can control<br>
chemical interactions with the interface materials on both sides of the material, as well as the<br>
electrical properties of the interface.<br>
[0114] The layers of materials in the stack can be deposited as a continuous film in the case<br>
where it is desired to grow many, e.g., an array of several hundreds or many thousands of,<br>
nanostructures on a single substrate. A patterned film can also be used to control the properties<br>
but in specific localized areas, leading to fabrication of individual devices. The deposited film<br>
thickness may vary from. 0.5 nm to more than 100 cm, e.g., as much as ISO nm, 200nm, or even<br>
500 nm, depending on the substrate underneath. Preferably, however, the thickness is from 1 to<br>
10 nm, and even more preferably, from 5 to 50 nm.<br>
[0115] The nanostructures of the present invention can also be grown individually rather than<br>
as a dense "forest". For example, such nanostructures may be discrete carbon fibers. This is the<br>
case where catalyst layer and sizes are defined by lithography for example. For the case where a<br>
continuous film (in the form of stripes and squares larger than 100 nm X100 nm) is used, more<br>
densely packed structures are possible (approximately 15 nm spacing between two adjacent<br>
nanostructures is preferred). In such continuous film configurations, the packing density and<br>
resulting diameter of the nanostructures can however be controlled by the choice of support layer.<br>
[0116] In particular, the body of the nanostructures can be designed to be structures that<br>
include: hollow with electrical properties such as semiconducting or metallic; not hollow with<br>
different electrical properties (mainly metallic); hollow with different mechanical properties; and<br>
not hollow with different mechanical properties.<br>

Controlling Nanostructure properties<br>
[0117] The present invention encompasses nanostructures grown from substrates, and<br>
interface layers situated therebetween, having the following characteristics. The substrate is<br>
preferably a metal layer, which maybe disposed on a support. The support is typically a wafer of<br>
silicon or other semiconducting material, glass, or suitable flexible polymer used in thin film<br>
technology. The metal is preferably selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten,<br>
platinum, palladium, and tantalum. The thickness of the metal layer is preferably in the range 1<br>
nm to 1µm and even more preferably in the range 1 nm to 50 nm. The metal layer is preferably<br>
deposited by any one of several methods known in the art, including but not limited tor.<br>
evaporative methods such as thermal or vacuum evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy, and<br>
electron-beam evaporation; glow-discharge methods such as any of the several forms of sputtering<br>
known in the art, and plasma processes such as plasma-enhanced CVD; and chemical processes<br>
including gas-phase processes such as chemical vapor deposition, and ion implantation, and<br>
liquid-phase processes such as electroplating, and liquid phase epitaxy. Examples of deposition<br>
technologies are found in Handbook of Thin Film Deposition, K. Seshan, Ed., Second Edition,<br>
(William Andrew, In., 2002).<br>
[0118] The interface layers, also called intermediate layers or an intermediate layer, comprise<br>
one or more layers, in sequence, disposed upon the substrate. On top of the interface layers is a<br>
layer of catalyst. The nanostructure is grown from on top of the catalyst layer.<br>
[0119] The interface layers may consist simply of a single layer of material. In this<br>
circumstance, the single layer is preferably silicon or germanium. The layers can be deposited in<br>
the form of amorphous or crystalline by techniques such as evaporation, or sputtering. The<br>
preferable thickness ranges from 1 nm to 1 nm and even more preferably in the range 1 nm to 50<br>
nm.<br>
[0120] The interface layers may comprise several layers of different materials and may be,<br>
arbitrarily, classified according to function. For example, the layers in the vicinity of the substrate<br>
are characterized as layers that influence the electrical properties of the interface. The layers in<br>
the vicinity of the catalyst are characterized as layers that influence the composition and properties<br>
such as electrical/mechanical properties of the nanostructure.<br>
[0121] Various configurations of interface layers are compatible with the present invention;<br>
For example, a sequence of up to 3 layers may be deposited on the substrate, for the purpose of<br>
controlling the electrical properties of the interface. Such configurations include, but are not<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2OM/OO0487<br>
limited to: a sequence of insulator, conductor or semiconductor, and insulator; a sequence of<br>
insulator adjacent to the substrate, and a semiconducting layer; a sequence of semiconductor,<br>
insulator, semiconductor, a sequence of two insulating barrier layers adjacent to the substrate, and<br>
a semiconductor; a single layer of a metal that is different from the metal of the substrate; and a<br>
sequence of a metal that is different from the metal of the substrate, and a semiconducting layer.<br>
In such configurations, the insulator may be selected from the group consisting of: SiOx, Al2O3,<br>
ZrOx, HfOx, SiNX, A12O3, Ta2O3, TiO2, and ITO. The semiconductor may be silicon or<br>
germanium. The metal, where present, may be palladium, platinum molybdenum or tungsten.<br>
Where two layers of the same character are present, e.g., two semiconducting layers, it is not<br>
necessary that the layers have the same composition as one another.<br>
[0122] The uppermost layer of the foregoing interface layers may itself abut against the<br>
catalyst layer. This is particularly the case where the uppermost layer is a semiconductor such as<br>
silicon or germanium. However, it is additionally possible for the foregoing interface layers to<br>
have disposed upon them a further layer or sequence of layers that lies between them and the<br>
catalyst layer. Such additional, or second, interface layers are thought of as controlling the<br>
properties and composition of the nanostructure. The second interface layers may be a pair of<br>
layers, such as a metal layer and on top thereof a semiconductor layer adjacent to the catalyst<br>
layer. Alternatively, the second interface layers may simply consist of a single layer of<br>
semiconductor. The metal layer, where present in the second interface layers, is preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of tungsten, molybdenum, palladium, and platinum. The<br>
semiconducting layer in the second interlace layers is preferably silicon or germanium.<br>
[0123] The catalyst layer is typically a layer of metal or metal alloy, and may contain very fine<br>
particles of metal or metal alloy instead of being a continuous film. The catalyst layer preferably<br>
comprises a metal selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, iron, nickel-chromium<br>
alloy containing nickel and chromium in any proportions, and molybdenum.<br>
[0124] The invention is primarily focused on a multi-stack configuration of at least one<br>
material layer between the catalyst layer and the conducting substrate, wherein the material is not<br>
of the same kind as the catalyst and conducting substrate, and wherein the material controls the<br>
chemical reactions between the various layers. Thus, the growth of the nanostructures on different<br>
conducting substrates can be controlled. Thereby the morphology and properties of the grovm<br>
structures as well as the tip materials of the grown structures can be controlled. The current<br>
invention can be extended to having several stacks of materials of different kinds<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
(semiconducting, ferroelectric, magnetic, etc.) which can be used to control the properties at<br>
base/interface, body and the tip of the nanostructure. It is also possible that the nanostructure is<br>
grown, upon a conducting layer which is itself deposited on a substrate that itself can be of any<br>
kind, such as conducting, insulating or semiconducting.<br>
[0125] High-k dielectric materials are mainly used aa gate materials for CMOS devices. In the<br>
present invention such materials are utilized in part in multi-layer stacks to define the properties of<br>
the grown nanostructure as well as to control the interface properties between the nanostructure<br>
and the conducting layer.<br>
[0126] According to the methods of the present invention, the presence of two or more<br>
intermediate layers will influence the texture/crystallographic structures of each other and the final<br>
catalyst particles.<br>
[0127] Accordingly, the present invention preferably includes a conducting layer, at least one<br>
intermediate layer directly on the conducting layer, at least one catalyst layer directly on the<br>
intermediate layer, and a nanostructure on the catalyst layer.<br>
[0128] The substrate may be a disposed on a support commonly used in semiconductor<br>
processing, such as a silicon wafer, or oxidized silicon wafer. The support may alternatively be a<br>
glass or metal or thin flexible polymer film used in the thin film technology as substrate.<br>
[0129] It is to be understood that the at least one intermediate layer is chosen to control<br>
various electrical properties of the interface between the substrate and the carbon nanostructure.<br>
[0130] It is further to be understood that the choice of at least one catalyst layer controls<br>
various properties of the carbon nanostructure.<br>
[0131] The grown nanostructures are preferably carbon-based materials such as carbon<br>
nanotubes (CNT), and carbon nanofibers (CNF). Carbon nanostructures form when the entire<br>
structure is placed in a mixture of carbon-containing gases. Preferred gases are hydrocarbons such<br>
as CH4, C2H2 and C2H4, and generally aliphatic hydrocarbons having 5 or fewer carbon atoms, of<br>
any level of saturation.<br>
[0132] The nanostructures can also be of different semiconducting materials referred to as III-<br>
V, or II-VI materials, such as InP, GaAs, AlGaAs, depending on the choice of catalyst and<br>
subsequent chemical chamber conditions used. . Keeping all the other materials stack same as<br>
for a carbon nanostructure described herein, simply changing the catalyst type and or composition<br>
-20-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
of gases can facilitate growth of these non-carbon nanostructures. Therefore without deviating<br>
from the other aspects of the invention described herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art can<br>
grow different kinds of solid state nanostructures. Examples of conditions for forming such<br>
nanostructures are as follows.<br>
[0133] SiC nanostructures: chambers - MOCVD (metallo organic CVD); gas composition-<br>
dichloromethylvinylsilara [CH2CHSi(CH3)Cl2]; catalyst-Ni; and temperature: 800-1200 °C.<br>
[0134] Si nanostructures: chamber type-vapor-liquid-solid (VLS)/CVD; gas composition-<br>
SiH4, Si2H6; catalyst-Ni; and temperature 500-1000 °C.<br>
[0135] InP/GaP nanostructures: chambers - MOCVD/CVD; gas composition- elemental<br>
indium and gallium with triphenyl phospbine, trimethyl-gallium and N2; catalyst; and temperature:<br>
350-800 °C.<br>
[0136] GaN nanostructures: chambers - MOCVD (metallo organic CVD); gas/ composition -<br>
elemental gallium and ammonia gas; catalyst-Ni; and temperature: 800 - 900 °C.<br>
[0137] ZnO nanostructures: chambers - MOCVD/CVD; gas composition - oxidation of Zinc<br>
carrying elements; catalyst-Ni; temperature 30 - 700 °C.<br>
[0138] The grown nanostructures for materials other than carbon can be of the form of forests<br>
consisting of uniform structures covering the substrate area and/or arrays, or individual structures.<br>
[0139] The choice of catalyst plays an important role because the growth of carbon<br>
nanostructures is ordinarily catalytically controlled Since the crystallographic orientation of the<br>
catalysts partakes in defining the morphology of the nanostructure, it is expected to obtain<br>
different growth mechanisms from different types of catalysts. Besides catalyst crystallographic<br>
orientation, there are many other growth conditions that influence the structure formation, such as<br>
the mixture of gases, current density for the case when plasma density is controlled, voltage<br>
between the cathode and anode, temperature of the substrate, chamber pressure, etc. (see, e.g.,<br>
Kabir, M. S.; Morjan, R. E.; Nerushev, O. A.; Lundgren, P.; Bengtsson, S.; Enokson, P.; and<br>
Campbell, E. E. B., Nanotechnology 2005, (4), 458) incorporated herein by reference).<br>
[0140] FIGs. 3A and 3B show an overview of various structures according to the invention.<br>
FIG. 3A shows bow a carbon nanostructure having a tip 110, body 120 and a base 130, and made<br>
by processes described herein, can be positioned vertically on a metal substrate as in the left-hand<br>
side of FIG. 3A, or horizontally on an insulating substrate as in the right-hand side of FIG. 3A.<br>
-21-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
Positioning on an insulating substrate will allow for further processing for making functional<br>
devices. The bottom substrate (not shown) underneath the insulating layer can be used as a<br>
bottom gate dielectric and the substrate underneath the oxide as bottom gate electrode to e.g.,<br>
modulate the resistance of a semiconducting natiostructure. See FIG. 3B.<br>
[0141] FIG. 3B shows various configurations of one or more intermediate layers 210 between<br>
a conducting substrate 200 and a catalyst layer 220. The invention proposes a platform<br>
comprising at least one material stack (denoted, e.g., layer 1) between the catalyst layer are the<br>
conducting substrate. The purpose of the multiple materials stacks (denoted, e.g., layer 1, layer 2,<br>
...layer n) is to control the interface properties between the conducting substrate and the grown<br>
nanostructures (for example, ranging from Ohmic contact to Schottky barrier), the properties of<br>
the grown nanostructures (morphology, mechanical, and electrical properties), and the properties<br>
of the tip 110 of the grown nanostructures.<br>
[0142] FIGs. 5 and 6 show embodiments of a device having a single intermediate layer. In<br>
FIG. 5, in another embodiment, a metal layer 510 is on a wafer 520; an intermediate layer of<br>
silicon S30 is on the metal layer; and a catalyst layer 540, typically Ni, or Fe, or others such as<br>
NiCr or, Pd, is on the intermediate layer. Together, layers 530 and 540 are referred to as the<br>
interface.<br>
[0143] In FIG. 6, another typical individual nanostructure is shown. In this structure, a metal<br>
layer 610 is on a wafer 620; an interface 630 between the metal layer and a body of a<br>
nanostructure 640 is formed from an intermediate layer of semi-conducting material 645 such as<br>
silicon. The tip 650 of the nanostructure contains a mixture of materials, including principally<br>
catalyst that has diffused up the body of the nanostructure as the nanostructure has grown, and<br>
also some metal.<br>
[0144] FIG. 4 shows a representative embodiment having a multilayer stack supporting a<br>
partially formed nanostructure 499. A metal layer 410 acts as a substrate, and is disposed on a<br>
support 420, e.g., a wafer of silicon. A 3-layer stack acts as an intermediate layer between the<br>
metal substrate and a second stack of catalytic layers and controls the electrical properties of the<br>
interface. The intermediate layer has, in order, starting with a layer in contact with the metal: a<br>
first control layer 430, of e.g., SiOx, or Al2O3; on top of the first control layer is a metal/semi-<br>
metal layer 440, e. g., Ge; on top of the metal/semi-metal layer is a second control layer 450 of,<br>
e.g., ZrOx or HfOx or any other material with high k dielectric value such as SiNx, Ta2O5, Al2O3,<br>
and TiO2. The subscript 'x' in a chemical formula denotes a variable stoichiometry, usually<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
controllably variable. The two control layers control diffusion from respectively the metal/semi-<br>
metal layer into the substrate and into the catalyst stack The thickness and composition of the<br>
two control layers provide two variables with which such control may be achieved. The thickness<br>
for a single layer ranges from less than 10 nm to several hundreds of nanometer and the thickness<br>
of the total material stack ranges from less than 10 nm up to microns and above. Together, the<br>
first control, metal/semi-metal, and second control layers permit control of electrical properties of<br>
the interface between the metal and the carbon nanostructure. To obtain different electron/hole<br>
tunneling properties, it is a matter of choosing different oxides to give a variation of electrical<br>
tunneling properties and hence varying electrical properties of the interface between the<br>
nanostructure and the base substrate 410. Principally, such choices are determined by the<br>
dielectric constant of the control layer materials such as oxides.<br>
[0145] Also referring to FIG. 4, a multilayer stack disposed on the second control layer<br>
controls properties of the carbon nanostructure that grows above it. In the example shown,<br>
adjacent to the second control layer is a first metal layer 460, e.g., tungsten, molybdenum,<br>
palladium, platinum; adjacent to the first metal layer is a silicon layer 470; and on top of the<br>
silicon layer is a second metal layer 480 composed of, e.g., nickel or palladium.<br>
[0146] FIG. 7 shows another embodiment of a nanostructure having a tip 610, a body 620, and<br>
an. interface 630. A metal layer 640 is disposed on a wafer 650 and consists of a metal selected<br>
from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, platinum, tantalum, and palladium. A two-<br>
layer interface 630 is on the metal layer 640 and has a first intermediate layer 660 of oxide, such<br>
as SiOx, ZrOx, HfOx, or TiOx; a second intermediate layer 670, composed of silicon, is disposed<br>
on the first intermediate layer and is in contact with the body of the nanostructure. The tip 610 of<br>
the nanostructure contains Ni, Fe, Mo, or Pd, or an alloy such as NiCr or a mixture of the<br>
materials found in the material stack. The metal content of the tip originates with a layer of<br>
catalyst (not shown in FIG. 7) that was situated between the uppermost intermediate layer and the<br>
bottom of the nanostructure.<br>
[0147] FIG. 8 shows another nanostructure having a tip 710, a body 720, and an interface 730<br>
which comprises a multi-layer stack. A metal layer 740 is disposed on a wafer 750. A three-layer<br>
interface 730 is on the metal layer 740 and has a first intermediate layer 760 of semi-metal such as<br>
germanium; a second intermediate layer 770 of oxide, such as SiOx, ZrOx, HfOx or TiOx; and a<br>
third intermediate layer 780, composed of silicon, which is in contact with the body of the<br>
-23 -<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
nanostructure. The tip of the nanostructure contains Ni, Fe, Mo, or Pd, or an alloy such as NiCr or<br>
a mixture of the materials found in the interface,<br>
[0148] FIG. 9 shows another embodiment of a nanostructure: a metal layer 910 is disposed on<br>
a wafer 920; an interface 930 having three intermediate layers is disposed on the metal layer 910.<br>
The three intermediate layers, in sequence moving away from the metal, are: a second barrier<br>
layer 940, a first barrier layer 950 and a semiconducting layer 960, in contact with die body of the<br>
nanostructure 970. The first barrier layer can be used as a material diffusion barrier<br>
upwards/downwards, sad the second barrier layer can be used as defining the electrical tunnel<br>
barrier. The body of the nanostructure can have electrical properties either as a semiconductor or<br>
a conductor. The tip 980 of the nanostructure contains catalyst<br>
[0149] As is seen from FIGs. 6-9, catalyst diffuses into the body of the nanostructure during<br>
growth initiation. This proccss is described in further detail in FIG. 10. In FIG. 10, a metal<br>
underlayer 1010 of a metal such as W, Mo, Pt, Pd,. is on a wafer 1020. An intermediate layer of a<br>
semiconducting material 1030 such as silicon or germanium, or a compound of III-V elements<br>
from the periodic table, is on the metal underlayer. A catalyst layer 1040 having a metal such as<br>
Ni, Fe, Co, or an alloy such as NiCr is on the intermediate layer.<br>
[0150] A stage during growth of the nanostructure is shown in the right-hand panel of FIG. 10.<br>
An expanded view of the metal underlayer is shown. An interface 1060 between the metal<br>
underiayer and the body 1050 of the growing nanostructure contains an alloy of catalyst with<br>
metal underiayer, metal silicides, and the metal underlayer itself.<br>
[0151] The intermediate layer 1030 is used to start the growth process. However it diffuses<br>
into the metal uaderlayers creating metal compounds such as metal-silicides if the intermediate<br>
layer is silicon, which function as Ohmic contacts with the metal underlayer. Accordingly the<br>
nanostructure is grown by direct contact with metal underlayer where no intermediate layer is<br>
present in between the initial catalyst and metal underlayer. A small portion of catalyst is present<br>
at the bottom. The tip consists of catalyst rich metal underlayer: a large portion of catalyst is<br>
present at the tip of the nanostructure together with a small portion of metal underlayer.<br>
[0152] In FIG. 11, an embodiment of nanostructure growth uses a tungsten (W) metal<br>
undsrlayer 1110 on a wafer 1120. A stack having a layer of silicon 1130 on top of the metal<br>
underbyer, and a layer of nickel 1140 on top of the silicon is in contact with a growing<br>
nanostructure 1180. The material stack conditions before growth (FIG. 11, left hand panel) show<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
discrete layers. The material stack conditions after growth (FIG. 11, right hand panel) show that<br>
interdiffusion amongst the layers has occurred: there are now distinct regions of nickel-tungsten<br>
alloy 1150, tungsten-silicon alloy 1160, and undiffused tungsten 1170. It is also consistent with<br>
the conditions that the regions of, e.g., nickel and tungsten have a gradation of properties without<br>
a discontinuity in the concentrations of the respective metals or a sharp concentration gradient<br>
[0153] FIG. 12 shows a multilayer stack between a metal underlayer 1210 and a nanostructers<br>
body 1230. The multilayer stack comprises two interfaces, a first interface 1240 to control<br>
electrical properties of the interface, and a second interface 1250 to control physical properties of<br>
the nanostructure body. Metal underlayer 1210 is on a wafer 1220. First interface 1240<br>
comprises two layers disposed on the metal control the electrical properties of the interface. A<br>
layer of germanium 1260 is directly on the metal 1210, and a layer 1270 of an oxide such as SiOx,<br>
ZrOx, HfOx, or TiOx is directly on the germanium. The oxide layer acts as a buffer. Two further<br>
layers, disposed on the oxide layer, serve to control physical properties of the body of the<br>
nanostructure. A first layer 1280 of silicon is directly on the oxide layer, and a layer 1290 of<br>
metal catalyst such as nickel, iron, or palladium is in between the silicon layer and the body of the<br>
nanostructure.<br>
Process for forming nanostructures<br>
[0154] The present Invention further comprises a process for forming nanostructures. The<br>
process comprises first depositing an electrode on a substrate. The substrate, as further described<br>
herein, may be a wafer of silicon, and preferably has an insulating coating, such as an oxide, for<br>
example SiOx The electrode functions as an underlayer for the nanostructure, and is made of a<br>
conducting material, preferably a metal such as molybdenum, niobium, or tungsten. The method<br>
of depositing the electrode can be any one familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art, but is<br>
preferably a method such as electron beam evaporation. The electrode layer is between 10 and<br>
100 nm thick, and is preferably 50 nm thick.<br>
[0155] Optionally, a resist is then deposited on the electrode layer. Such a resist is usually<br>
used for technologies that utilize lift-off processes for metal depositions. An exemplary resist is a<br>
double-layer resist consisting of 10% co-polymer and 2% PMMA resist, that is applied by<br>
consecutive spin coating and baking. The resist is then patterned/exposed by a radiation source,<br>
such as UV light OT an electron beam, to transfer the design into the resist layer.<br>
[0156] A catalyst layer, either as a sheet or as dots, is fabricated on the metal substrate or on<br>
the resist, where present. Dots of catalyst facilitate controlled growth of individual nanostructures<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
in precise locations. Catalyst dots may be constructed by electron beam lithography. Their<br>
dimensions can be controlled using the shot modulation technique. With this technique, catalyst<br>
dot sizes can be determined with nanometer precision, and dots as small as 5-10 nm in dimension<br>
can be formed. The catalyst layer is not heated during this stage.<br>
[0157] On the catalyst layer, layers of other materials are deposited. Such layers include at<br>
least one layer of semiconducting material and may include at least one layer of a metal different<br>
from the metal of the underlying electrode. The semiconducting material is preferably deposited<br>
using an electron beam evaporator. The semiconducting material is preferably amorphous silicon,<br>
and the layer has a thickness of 5 -100 nm, preferably 10 nm.<br>
[0158] After the various layers, including one layer of semiconducting material, are deposited<br>
a layer of catalyst material is deposited, thereby forming aa uppermost layer upon which<br>
nanostructures are ultimately fabricated, The catalyst layer is deposited by standard techniques<br>
known in the art such as electron beam evaporation or sputtering.<br>
[0159] Optionally, if a resist has been applied, it can now be removed by a lift-off process, for<br>
example by washing the structures in acetone at 60 °C, followed by washing with iso-propyl<br>
alcohol. After these washings, the structures are rinsed in deionized water and blow-dried with<br>
nitrogen gas.<br>
[0160] Nanostructures can now be grown upon the remaining areas where catalyst layers are<br>
exposed. The preferred technique for effecting such growth is plasma-enhanced chemical vapor<br>
deposition. As previously described herein, the composition of the vapor will determine the types<br>
of nanostructures that are grown. For example, carbon nanotubes can be grown at 5 mbar pressure<br>
in a (1:5) mixture of C2H2:NH3 gas. Growth of nanostructures typically occurs at high<br>
temperatures, in the range 600 -1,000 °C, such as 700 °C. The substrate (with electrode,<br>
semiconducting material, and catalyst layers thereon) axe brought up to such high temperatures by<br>
ramping the temperature up relatively rapidly. Exemplary rates are from 1-10 °C/s, preferred<br>
rates being to. the range 3-6 °C/s. Such conditions have been referred to in the art as 'annealing',<br>
and preferably occur in a vacuum. A low vacuum (e.g. ,0.05-0.5 mbar pressure) suffices. The<br>
source gases for the nanostructures are introduced into the chamber when the maximum<br>
temperature is reached.<br>
[0161] The nanostructures are typically cooled to room temperature before they are permitted<br>
to be exposed to air.<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0162] Control over individual nanostructure formation is thus achieved because specifically<br>
tailored catalyst dots are created, rather than reiving on non-uniform break up of a layer of catalyst<br>
by prolonged heating prior to nanostructure formation.<br>
Applications<br>
[0163] Applications of carbon nanostructures made by the methods described herein include:<br>
construction of composites for use in structural engineering, as well as structures having high<br>
strength but light mass, as might be used for objects sent into outer space; electrochemical devices<br>
and sensors for diagnostics, as are used in the life sciences; research tools such as electron<br>
emitters, small size X-ray generators, and atomic force microscopy probes; and applications to<br>
circuitry components used in electronics such as interconnects, diodes, heat dissipative media,<br>
high frequency filters, optical devices such as light emitting diodes, wave guides, opto-electronic<br>
circuits, hydrogen storage devices, qubits for quantum computing, and super capacitors.<br>
[0164] For example, FIG. 12 shows how an individual nanostructure can become part of an<br>
electric circuit. A 3-layer stack 1310 controls properties of the interface and consists of a first<br>
diffusion barrier 1330, adjacent the metal 1320, and composed of SiOx or Al2O3 or another<br>
dielectric material. An island 1340, of metal or semi-metal is situated between the first diffusion<br>
barrier and a second diffusion barrier 1350 of ZrOx or HfOx or choice of other dielectric material.<br>
A further 3-layer stack 1360 controls properties of the interface and is on the second diffusion<br>
barrier layer 1350. A metal layer 1370 acts as a growth substrate to control the properties of the<br>
grown structures and is in contact with the second diffusion barrier 1350; a silicon layer 1380 is<br>
on the metal layer and a nickel or palladium catalyst layer 1390 is on the silicon layer. The silicon<br>
layer allows interdiffusion to control the properties of the grown structures. The carbon<br>
nanostructure 1395 is conductive in this example and is a carbon nanofiber. Metal layer 1320 is<br>
on a wafer 1305.<br>
[0165] FIG. 14 shows how the nanostructure of FIG. 13 would function in an electric circuit<br>
that contains a battery 1410 as a representative voltage source. The items labeled 1330,1340,<br>
1350, and 1395 in FIG. 14 correspond to similarly numbered items in FIG. 13.<br>
[0166] FIG. 15 shows how an individual nanostructure can form part of an electronic device.<br>
The metal underlying layer 1510, is disposed on wafer 1520, and is for example tungsten and is a<br>
first instance of a first metal. A second metal, having a different work function from the<br>
underlying metal, for example is platinum, forms a layer 1530 disposed on the underlying metal<br>
layer. This second metal layer controls the electrical properties of the interface between metal<br>
-27 -<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
layer 1510 and the carbon nanostructure 1540. A second layer 1550 of the first metal is disposed<br>
on the layer of second metal. This layer and the two above it control the properties of the<br>
nanostructure. The two layers above layer 1550 are, in sequence, silicon 1560, and iron 1570.<br>
The last of these is a catalytic layer. In this embodiment, the carbon nanostructure is a<br>
semiconductivc carbon nanotube.<br>
[0167] FIG. 16 shows how a nanostructure can form part of an electro-optical device such is a<br>
light emitting diode, or as the variable conducting channel like a transistor. A structure as it: FIG.<br>
15 is encapsulated in an insulator 1510 such as SiOx on each side, and on top a third metal 1620,<br>
such as tungsten or calcium, having a different work function than that of the bottom metal<br>
electrode 1630 in the figure. Metal layer 1510 is disposed in a wafer 1630. Carbon nanostructure<br>
1540 is a semiconducting carbon nanotube in this example.<br>
[0168] FIG. 17 shows how an individual nanostructure can form a Schottky barrier as part of<br>
an electrical device. A metal underlay er 1710 is disposed on a. wafer 1720. On top of the metal<br>
underlayer 1710, which is composed of, e.g., tungsten, is a pair of layers that controls the<br>
electrical properties of the interface. A layer 1720 of a second metal, such as platinum, having a<br>
different work function from the metal of the metal underlayer 1710 is on top of the metal<br>
underlayer. A layer 1730 of a semiconductor such as germanium is on the layer of second metal.<br>
This combination of two metal layers and a semiconducting layer creates a Schottky barrier due to<br>
the mismatch of work function of different materials and therefore controls the electrical<br>
properties of the interface. Three further layers for controlling the properties of the nanostructure<br>
above, are disposed upon the semiconductor layer 1730. In sequence, the three layers are: a layer<br>
1750 of the first metal (in this instance tungsten), a silicon layer 1760, and lastly a nickel layer<br>
1770 that functions as a catalyst. Disposed on the catalyst layer is a nanostructure such as a<br>
carbon nanotube or a carbon nanofiber.<br>
[0169] FIG. 18 shows how an individual nanostructure can form a Schottky barrier as part of<br>
an electronic device. In this embodiment the lower segment, mentioned in the foregoing<br>
paragraph in connection with FIG. 17, and consisting of a metal and semiconductor layer, is<br>
excluded. The remaining segment consisting of material layers determining that the nanostructure<br>
has semiconducting properties is present a metal layer 1820 is disposed on a metal underlayer<br>
1810. The work function of the metal of layer 1820 is different from that for the metal underlayer<br>
1810. On layer 1820 are, in sequence, a semiconductor layer 1830, of e.g., silicon, and a catalyst<br>
layer 1840 of e.g., iron. This embodiment consists of a semiconducting nanostructure 1850 grown<br>
-28-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
on metal underlayer will create a Schottky barrier due to mismatch of work function of the metal<br>
and the band gap of semiconducting nanostructure. FIG. 19 shows a schematic representation of<br>
Schottky Barrier formation between the contact metal and the nanotube for a device as shown in<br>
FIG. 18, according to two types of metal electrodes: (a) for a large work function metal, and (b)<br>
for small work function metal. In the former case, the Fermi level Ep of the electrode metal is<br>
close in energy to the valence band Ey of the carbon nanostructure (denoted SWCNT), and holes<br>
pass easily across the interface from the metal to the carbon nanostructure. In the latter case, the<br>
Fermi level of the electrode metal is close to the conduction band Ec of the carbon nanostructure,<br>
and electrons pass easily across the interface from the metal to the carbon nanostructure.<br>
Field emission device<br>
[0170] In particular, the nanostructures of the present invention may form the basis of a field<br>
emission device. FIGs. 20A-20C show successively detailed views of such a device 2000. FIG.<br>
20A shows, schematically, a field emission device having several pixels mounted in a chamber<br>
2010. Each pixel has a metal substrate 2020, one or more nanostructures 2080 mounted thereon.<br>
The metal substrate is in electrical communication with a metal cathode 2060 through one or more<br>
interconnects 2070. Cathode 2060 is in electrical communication with a device controller 2050<br>
and an anode 2040. Device controller is typically an electrical component capable of providing a<br>
voltage across a specific pixel. Device controller is preferably able to control multiplexing of the<br>
device so that pixels can be individually addressed, for example by using an active addressing<br>
scheme. In normal operation, upon application of a voltage between the cathode and anode,<br>
nanostructures 2080 emit electrons towards anode 2040. The electrons impact a phosphor layer<br>
2030 that is in contact with the anode, and cause it to emit one or more photons of visible light It<br>
is preferable that anode 2040 is transparent so that the photons are emitted in a direction away<br>
from the pixels. Chamber 2010 is preferably sealed so that it contains either a vacuum or an inert<br>
gas such as argon. This arrangement ensures that the nanostructures have along lifetime and do<br>
not decompose or react with oxygen or water vapor normally found in air.<br>
[0171] The system depicted in FIG. 20A is more practical than cathode ray tubes used in the<br>
art because it can be flatter. It also offers brighter displays than other comparable displays used in<br>
the art, such as LED's, OLED's, and LCD's. For example, the contrast ratios achievable with<br>
LCD's are around 1,000:1, whereas those obtained from electron emission devices are around<br>
20,000:1, Such contrast ratios make electron emitting devices such as shown in FIG. 20A<br>
suitable for handheld devices such as cell-phones, GPS receivers, arid other devices that see a lot<br>
of use in outdoor lighting conditions.<br>

[0172] FIG. 20B shows a more detailed view of an individual pixel from FIG. 20A having<br>
electrical communication with device controller 2050. Nanostructure 2080 are optionally<br>
separated from each other by a layer of insulating material 2082. The thickness of the insulator is<br>
such that the tips of the nanostructures protrude from the upper surface of the insulator, as shown.<br>
It is preferable that the nanostructures shown are of approximately equal length, preferably within<br>
±10% of each other, so that equal amounts protrude from the insulator. Nanostructures 2080 are<br>
preferably carbon aanotubes, and still more preferably single-walled car jon nanotubes. In still<br>
other embodiments, nanostructures 2080 are nanofibers. Exemplary lengths of the nanostructures<br>
are 500 nm -10 µm, and exemplary diameters are 10 nm -100nm. The pixel typically has<br>
dimensions 10 µm by 10 µm and the nanostructures are typically spaced apart by 200 nm-1 µm<br>
Thus, the number of nanostructures supported in a given pixel is 100 - 2,500.<br>
[0173] In practice for color displays, an Individual pixel of a display comprises three of the<br>
structures shown in FIG. 20B, overlain with a suitable mask. Each of the three structures is<br>
masked to give one of the three primary colors, red, green, and blue, and is independently<br>
addressable for the purpose of generating a color image.<br>
[0174] FIG. 20B also shows, schematically, a photon 2084 emitted from phosphor layer 2030.<br>
Carbon nanostructures are effective light emitters because they give unidirectional emission<br>
towards phosphor layer 2030.<br>
[0175] FIG. 20C shows a more detailed view of the base and interface layers of an individual<br>
nanostructure 2080, for example in a pixel of FIG. 20B. Only the lower part of the body of<br>
nanostructure 2080 is shown. A catalyst layer 2092 is shown in contact with the base of<br>
nanostructure 2080. The catalyst layer 2092 is on a layer 2090 that may be a single layer of a<br>
semiconductor such as silicon or germanium, and may be a multi-layer stack of metals and or<br>
semiconductors as further described herein. Layer 2090 is disposed upon metal substrate 2020. In<br>
the configuration depicted in FIG. 20C, the interface between metal 2020 and nanostructure 2080 .<br>
forms an Ohmic contact.<br>
[0176] The field emission device shown in FIGs. 20 A - 20C operates at a much lower voltage<br>
than other comparable devices that are not grown on a metal substrate such as 2020, but instead<br>
are grown on an insulating substrate. Metal 2020 is preferably tungsten, molybdenum, platinum.<br>
or palladium.<br>

Electron Beam Writer<br>
[0177] The nanostructures of the present invention may also form the basis of an electron<br>
beam writer, as depicted in FIGs. 21-23. Such a device can be viewed as a single-nanostructure<br>
version of the field-emission device described hereinabove. A device according to FIGs. 21-23<br>
can find numerous applications where a very fine, focusable beam of electrons is required. For<br>
example, it can be used in electron beam lithography to create nanometer scale lines (so called<br>
nanolithography). It can also be used in forms of electron microscopy, such as scanning electron<br>
microscopy, and in transmission electron microscopy.<br>
[0178] FIGs. 21A - 21C show cross-sectional views, viewed sideways, of an electron-beam<br>
writing device 2100. Layer 2110 is a wafer, typically of highly doped silicon, which acts as a<br>
bottom electrode. Layer 2120 is insulator such as silicon dioxide. Layer 2130 is also insulator<br>
such as SiO2 which act as sacrificial layer that can be etched away during the manufacturing<br>
process of making electron beam writer. Layer 2140 is a top electrode, typically formed from a<br>
metal, and often referred to as an actuator electrode. A vertical free-standing nanostructure 2150<br>
resides in a cavity 2135 formed in layers 2130 and 2140. In some embodiments, nanostructure<br>
2150 is disposed on a layer of top electrode metal 2142. In other embodiments, nanostructure<br>
2150 is disposed on the wafer 2110.<br>
[0179] The embodiments shown in FIGs. 21A and 21B are of a single electrode stack<br>
electron-beam writer. The embodiment in FIG. 21C is of a multi-electrode stack device. In FIG.<br>
21C, layers 2140 and 2160 are metal electrode layers, and layers 2120,2130 and 2170 are<br>
insulating layers all together to form the embodiment for a electron-beam writer. In FIG. 21C,<br>
layers 2160 layer act as gate to control the movement of the nanostructure 2150 and layers 2140<br>
layer act as an actuator electrode.<br>
[0180] The embodiments described above as shown in FIGs. 21A, 21B and 21C can also be<br>
used for making relay switch where layer 2160 act as the gate electrode to control the movement<br>
of the nanostructure 2150, the layer 2142 act as the source of the device and the layer 2140 in this<br>
example act as the drain of the device to form an embodiment of three terminal device where the<br>
nanostructure 2150 can be moved towards the drain layer 2140 by applying electric field at the<br>
layer 2160.<br>
[0181] The base of naaostructure 2150 is shown in detail in connection with FIG. 21C, though<br>
similar principles apply to any of the foregoing embodiments, in FIGs. 21A and 21B.<br>
Nanostructure 2150 is separated fiom metal electrode layer 2142 by a catalyst layer 2152 and an<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
adjacent interface layer 2154. Interface layer 2154 may be a single layer, for example of silicon or<br>
germanium, or may comprise multiple adjacent layers. Where layer 2154 comprises multiple<br>
adjacent layers, at least one such layer is silicon or germanium; the other layers may be other<br>
semiconductors, insulators, or other metals different from the metal of layer 2142, so as to give<br>
control over the properties of nanostructure 2150.<br>
[0182] Nanostructure 2150 is typically 500 nm -10 µm long from base to tip, and is<br>
preferably around 1 µm long. The diameter of the nanostructure is typically between 5 nm and 50<br>
nm. Preferably nanostructure 2150 is a carbon nanostructure such as a carbon nanotube or<br>
nanofiber.<br>
[0183] FIGs. 22A - 22C show plan views from the top of various configurations of electrodes<br>
situated around a central vertical free-standing nanostructure 2150. In FIGs. 22A and 22B,<br>
multiple separately controllable electrodes are envisaged, numbered 2140, 2141, and 2143 - 2148.<br>
Exemplary numbers 4 and 8 are shown, though other numbers are possible, depending on the<br>
degree of control that is desired of the motion of the nanostructure. For example, other numbers<br>
of electrodes include, but are not limited to, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, and 20.<br>
[0184] In FIG. 22C, a single continuous electrode encircles the cavity 2135 in which<br>
nanostructure 2150 resides. FIG. 22D shows a perspective view of me embodiment in FIG. 22C.<br>
[0185] In operation, a voltage selectively applied to electrodes 2140, etc., can cause me tip of<br>
the nanostructure to move in space towards, or away from, a particular electrode, due to the<br>
electric field created by the electrodes. According to the disposition of the various electrodes,<br>
then, the nanostructure tip can move and therefore point in various directions. The directionality<br>
of the tip can therefore be controlled so that electrons, when emitted from the tip in response to a<br>
suitable applied voltage, will be caused to move in a desired direction.<br>
[0186] FIG. 23 shows a schematic of an electron-writing device based on a vertically-aligned<br>
free-standing nanostructure. The arrow across the nanostructure indicates a degree of freedom of<br>
motion within the plane of the figure. A beam of electrons, e-, is shown emanating from the tip of<br>
. the nanostructure 2150 in the direction of a writing target, or substrate 2310, which also serves as<br>
an anode. Also shown in FIG. 23 is a schematic electrical circuit between the anode and the top<br>
electrode.<br>
[0137] In certain embodiments, it is possible to change the direction of the beam direction<br>
after it has been emitted from the nanostructures, instead of or in addition to altering the beam<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
direction by causing the nanostructure to tilt in the desired direction. In which case, the direction<br>
of the beam after emission can be controlled by an electron optical system (EOS), based on, for<br>
example, magnetic lances.<br>
[0188] FIG. 24 shows an alternative embodiment in which a nanostructure 2410 is supported<br>
horizontally and has at least one degree of freedom, as shown by the arrow, to move in a vertical<br>
plane. An electrode 2420 in contact with the nanotubes communicates electrically with anode<br>
2430, which also acts as a writing target<br>
[0189] The electron beam writer described herein may be tailored to various applications by<br>
appropriate choices of the various materials. For example, the support wafer 2110, and the<br>
insulator disposed thereon 2120 may be varied, as may the choice of metal for the electrodes. The<br>
manner of growth of the nanostructure, as further described herein, may permit functionalization<br>
of the nanostructure tip, as well as its morphology.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Electron-beam writer<br>
[0190] FIG. 25 shows a SEM image of an embodiment of an electron beam writer that may be<br>
used as a nano writer, wherein: DCNT= Diameter of CNT/CNF/nano-structure; LSD = thickness of<br>
insulator; LCNT = Length of CNT/CNF/nanostructure; Lg = Distance between<br>
CNT/CNF/nanostructure and electrodes; FELAS - Elastostatic force acting on<br>
CNT/CNF/nanostructure; FELAS - Elastostatic force; and FvdW = Van der Waals force. The<br>
voltage source in FIG. 25 may be DC or AC source depending on application.<br>
[0191] The structure in FIG. 25 may also be used as an electron beam emitter for use in a<br>
display, wherein the position of the nanostructure is controlled while electrons are emitted from<br>
the structure onto, for instance, a fluorescent screen that emits photons when excited by electrons,<br>
thus providing a visible point. In this way, a display unit (pixel) with localized geometry control<br>
(sub pixels) is provided. By forming a plurality of these display units into a system of electron<br>
beam emitters, a display for use as a computer screen or television apparatus may be provided.<br>
Even without using the position control, the nano structure may find applicability as a pixel<br>
generating device due to the small scale of the complete system.<br>
[0192] The structure of FIG. 25 may also be used as a chemical sensor. Supsr-sensitive<br>
chemical sensors can be obtained by functionalization: by functionalizing the tip of the free-<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
standing nanostructure it is possible to attach different kinds of molecules. By actuating the nano<br>
structure by applying a bias (DC/AC depending on requirements) between top electrodes and<br>
bottom electrode/electrode N, it is possible to detect a molecule that binds to the tip by measuring<br>
the current flow through it.<br>
Example 2: Control<br>
[0193] This example presents results that evidence control over the morphology and control<br>
over the chemical composition present at the base and the tip of grown carbon nanostructures, see<br>
FIGs, 26A and 26B. FIG. 26A is a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph showing<br>
a carbon nanofiber grown on a W metal underlayer. FIG. 26A shows how the morphology can<br>
differ based on sample preparation recipe.<br>
[0194] FIG. 26B shows an example of how the chemical composition at the interface (base)<br>
and at the tip can be obtained. In FIG. 26B panel (a) there is a TEM image of a grown carbon<br>
nanofiber, in panel (b) an EDS spectrum shows the chemical elements at the tip of the fibers<br>
(catalyst region); and in panel (c) an EDS spectrum shows the chemical elements at the base of the<br>
fibers (underlayer region).<br>
[0195] The CNF grew from a flat catalyst surface and no significant catalyst film break up<br>
was observed (see, e.g., Kabir, M. S.; Morjan, R. E.;Nerushev, O. A.; Lundgren, P.; Bengtsson,<br>
S.; Enokson, P.; Campbell, E. E. B.,Nanotechnology, (4), 458, (2005), incorporated herein by<br>
reference).<br>
Example 3: incorporating nanostructures into a CMOS device<br>
[0196] Nanostructures as described herein can be incorporated into a CMOS device as vertical<br>
interconnects. To accomplish this, a filler layer such as an insulator is deposited over a substrate<br>
and the nanostructures situated thereon, and then polished/etched back until the nanostructure is<br>
exposed at the top. The catalyst layer can be removed, e.g., by etching, once the nanostructure is<br>
grown if required. . .<br>
Example 4: lift-off method for growing localized nanostructures<br>
[0197] The present invention also-encompasses a method of making nanostructures that are<br>
localized at specific positions, rather than being formed in arrays from a continuous film on a<br>
substrate. This method obviates the requirement of other processes in the art to anneal a film of<br>
catalyst to create discrete particles of catalyst in an uncontrolled manner.<br>
-34-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0198] According to this method, a metal layer, e.g., on a silicon substrate, is coated with a<br>
polymer layer. Such a polymer layer may be a photo-sensitive layer. The polymer layer is<br>
patterned by one of the several methods known in the art to define regions where one or more<br>
nanostructures are desired. The regions of polymer so patterned, i.e., where the nanostructures are<br>
intended to be positioned, are then removed, thus forming cavities in the polymer layer. A layer<br>
of insulator, e.g., amorphous silicon, is deposited over the polymer, followed by another layer of<br>
catalyst. The surrounding polymer layer is then removed, leaving defined regions such as dots of<br>
silicon, with catalyst on top. Such regions are bases upon which nanostructures can then be<br>
further constructed according to the various methods further described herein.<br>
Examples 5-7:<br>
[0199] In these examples, the results of experiments concerning the PECVD growth of nickel-<br>
catalyzed free-standing carbon nanotubes on six CMOS compatible metal underlayers (Cr, Ti, Pt,<br>
Pd, Mo, and W) are reported. These experiments focus in part on determining the optimum<br>
conditions for growing vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) on metal substrates using<br>
DC PECVD. Two sets of experiments were carried out to investigate the growth of VACNTs; (i)<br>
Ni was deposited directly on metal underlayers, and (ii) a thin amorphous layer of Si was<br>
deposited before depositing the Ni catalyst of the same thickness (10 nm). The introduction of an<br>
amorphous Si layer between the metal electrode and the catalyst was found to produce unproved<br>
growth activity in most cases.<br>
[0200] For many electronic applications it is desirable to use a metal which has a work<br>
function close to that of CNTs, i.e., ~5eV, for interconnects with nanotubes. Metals with work<br>
functions ranging from 4.33 to 5.64 eV were chosen. In these examples, the result of<br>
investigations related to the electrical integrity of the metal electrode layer after plasma treatment,<br>
the quality of the metal underlayers as interconnects and the quality of the grown CNTs is<br>
reported.<br>
Experimental Conditions For Examples 5-7<br>
[0201] Oxidized silicon substrates 1 cm2 in area and 500 Tm thick with an oxide (SiO2)<br>
thickness of 400 run were used .Cross sections of the prepared substrates are shown schematically<br>
in FIGs. 27A and 27B. (The relative thicknesses of the layers are not to scale.) First, the metal<br>
electrode layer (for example, Cr, Ti, Pt, Pd, Mo, or W) was evaporated directly on the substrate by<br>
electron beam evaporation to a thickness of 50 nm. Thereafter, either a 10 nm thick Ni film was<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
deposited partially covering the underlying metal layer (FIG. 27B), or an intermediate 10 nm thick<br>
amorphous silicon layer was deposited prior to the deposition of the Ni layer (FIG. 27 A). Si and<br>
Ni were evaporated at ~3 x 10-7 mbar chamber pressure to avoid the formation of any non-<br>
stoichiometric SiOx on the surface.<br>
[0202] A DC plasma-enhanced CVD chamber was used to grow the nanotubes on the<br>
structures of FIGs. 27A and 27B. The experimental set-up and detailed growth procedure were as<br>
described in Morjan, R. E., Maltsev, V., Nerushev, 0. A. and Campbell, E. E. B., Chem. phys.<br>
Lett.t 383, 385-90, (2004). The substrate was placed on a 2 cm diameter molybdenum grounded<br>
cathode that contains an Ohmic heater. The temperature of the cathode was measured via a<br>
thermocouple connected to a temperature controller. Thermal gradients across the heater body did<br>
not exceed a few Kelvin; additional testing without plasma revealed that heat losses from the <br>
surface were reasonably small, and that the substrate temperature was lower than the heater body<br>
by 10-15 K. The opposite effect of heating the substrate from the plasma sheath is estimated to be<br>
negligibly small due to the low current density and total power released in the discharge (two<br>
orders of magnitude less man used in other work such as: Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q., Cruden, B. A.,<br>
Li, J., Sarraazin, P. C, Ng, H. T., Han, J., and Meyyappan, M., Nanotechnology, 15,9, (2004);<br>
and Teo, K. B. K., Chhowalla, M, Amaratunga, G. A. J., Milne, W. L, Pirio, G., Legagneux, P.,<br>
Wyczisk, F., Pribat, D. and Hasko, D. G., Appl. Phys. Lett., 80,2011-3, (2002)). The nanotube<br>
growth was carried out in a C2H2:NH3 (1:5) gaseous mixture at 5 mbar chamber pressure for all of<br>
the experimental runs. The substrate was heated up to the growth temperature of 700 °C under a<br>
low vacuum pressure of 0.13 mbar with 3.8 °Cs-1 ramping rate. The breakdown voltage applied at<br>
the anode for plasma ignition was 1 kV. After introducing the gas mixture in the chamber, the<br>
voltage dropped to 400V. The current density at the cathode surface was 0.5-1 mA cm-2. The<br>
growth period was 15 minutes for all investigated substrate configurations. Note that a desire for<br>
accurate temperature control imposed a limitation on set-up design. The heater body and substrate<br>
are grounded, and the I-V characteristic of the discharge is limited by normal glow discharge<br>
conditions, i.e., the current density is almost constant and the total power released in the discharge<br>
is governed by the operational pressure. The potential drop between the cathode and anode is<br>
inversely proportional to the gas density and depends on the inter-electrode distance and gas<br>
composition.<br>
[0203] After growth, the samples were cooled down to room temperature before air exposure.<br>
Films grown in this way were then imaged with a JEOL JSM 6301F scanning electron microscope<br>
(SEM). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also employed to qualitatively study the substrate<br>
-36-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
morphology after the different processing steps. All the experiments were repeated to verity their<br>
reproducibility.<br>
Example 5: Catalyst deposited directly on metals (no Intermediate Si layer)<br>
[0204] FIG. 28 shows SEM images of the substrates after the growth sequence where a layer<br>
of nickel catalyst was deposited directly on top of the metal underlayer. In most cases no CNT<br>
growth is observed. The lack of growth observed on both Cr and Ti metal underlayers is contrary<br>
to previous work. For example, Ti and Cr have been used before as buffer layers between the<br>
catalyst and the native oxide covering of a silicon substrate to avoid the formation of nickel<br>
silicides during PECVD growth of carbon nanotubes or nanofibers (see, e.g., Han, J. H., and Kim,<br>
H. J., Mater. Sci. Eng. C 16, 65-8, (2001); and Merkulov, V. I., Lowndes, D.H., Wei, Y. Y., and<br>
Eres, G., Appl Phys. Lett., 76, 3555, (2000)). Also, Ti and Cr have been found to be the optimum<br>
metal underlayers for plasma-enhanced CVD growth of nanotubes using Ni and Co/Ni catalysts<br>
(see, e.g., Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q., Cruden, B. A., Li,J., Sarraazin, P. C, Ng, H. T., Han, J. and<br>
Meyyappan, M, Nanotechnology, 15,9, (2004)). However, the difference between the instant<br>
results and those reported previously may be related to the difference in experimental conditions.<br>
In particular, the Ti and Cr layer was deposited directly on an Si substrate with native oxide in the<br>
case of Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q., Cruden, B. A., Li, I, Sarraazin, P. C, Ng, H. T., Han, J. and<br>
Meyyappan, M, Nanotechnology, 15,9, (2004) and not on a thick layer of SiO2 as here.<br>
[0205] In the instant example, a much thicker (400 nm) oxide layer was used to provide a<br>
good insulating layer between the silicon and the metal electrode. The films where Ni has been<br>
deposited on Cr and Ti look rather smooth in the SEM pictures. AFM investigations of the<br>
substrates after heating, without the growth step, show that Ni on Cr and Ti does indeed produce a<br>
smooth surface after heating. Usage of other underlayers shows the presence of islands after<br>
heating, with average dimensions of 20-50 nm diameter and 1-5 nm height.<br>
[0206] The SEM picture of a Ni film on a Pt underlayer after growth (FIG. 28) panel (c)<br>
shows the presence of 20-40 nm islands. This is very similar to the structure of the substrate after<br>
heating, which was also investigated with AFM. No evidence for nanotube formation can be<br>
found in this sample. In contrast, the Ni-Pd combination (FIG. 28, panel (d)) leads to the<br>
formation of large irregular shaped columns after the growth process. In this case some small<br>
nanotube-like structures can be seen with diameters below 100 nm but with very low density of<br>
surface coverage.<br>
-37-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0207] AFM topographical images revealed the formation of small particles after the heating<br>
step in the Ni-Pd sample, though the impact of particle formation is not evident after the growth<br>
sequence. Only the Ni/Mo and Ni/W combinations (FIG. 28, panels (e) and (f)) lead to the<br>
formation of VACNT's under our growth conditions. The structures all showed good vertical<br>
alignment with the catalyst particle at the tip, The diameter was rather small, in the range 5-40<br>
nm, with lengths in the range 0.5 -1 µm. The density was, however, very low, with values of 5<br>
nanotubes µm-2 for Ni/Mo and 73 nanotubes µm-2 for Ni/W. The diameter distribution is plotted<br>
in FIG. 29.<br>
Example 6: Effects of an intermediate Si layer on the growth of nanotubes<br>
[0208] Since the first application of PECVD for growth of vertical aligned nanotube arrays on<br>
Ni films (Ren, Z. F.,Huang, Z. P., Xu, J. W., Wang, J.H.; Bush, P., Siegal, M.P., and Provencio, P.<br>
N., Science, 282, 1105-7, (1998)), researchers have discussed the role of surface morphology,<br>
catalyst thickness and etching reactions at the surface for the formation of catalyst particles.<br>
Silicide formation has been considered to be disadvantageous for nanotube growth and metal<br>
layers were used to prevent the formation of silicides (see, e.g., Han, J. H., and Kim, H. J., Mater.<br>
Sci. Eng. C 16,65-8, (2001); and Merkulov, V. L, Lowndes, D. H., Wei, Y. Y. and Eres, G., Appl.<br>
Phys. Lett,, 76 3555, (2000)). Recently, the detailed investigation of catalyst particles found in<br>
nanotubes grown on an iron catalyst was performed with energetically filtered TEM (Yao Y.,<br>
Falk, L. K. L., Morjan, R. E., Nerushev, O. A. and Campbell, E. E. B., J. Mater. Sci, 15, 583-94,<br>
(2004)). It was shown that the particles contain significant amounts of Si. Similar observations<br>
were made for CNTs grown with PECVD on Ni catalysts. Thus, silicides do not poison the<br>
nanotube growth and the question about the stoichiometry of the most favourable catalytic<br>
particles is still open. The results reported here exploit the silicidation process for catalyst island<br>
formation. By introducing Si as a sandwich layer between the catalyst and the metal underlayer, a<br>
significant improvement in growing nanotubes on different metal underlayers was achieved. This<br>
can clearly be seen in the series of SEM pictures shown inFIG. 30. Very low density growth was<br>
found for Ti, (FIG. 30, panel (a)) and no growth for Cr metal (FIG. 30, panel (b)) underlayers. In<br>
the case of Cr, many cracks and voids were created on the film after 15 min in the plasma growth<br>
chamber. In the case of Ti, nanotubes are seen to grow from some catalyst sites. These appear to<br>
be randomly grown nanotubes with diameters ranging from 10 to 50 nm and lengths extending up<br>
to several microns. They show no vertical alignment and there is no evidence for tip growth.<br>
VACNTs grew successfully on the other four substrates, however. The samples with Pd (FIG. 30,<br>
panel (d)) also contained long non-aligned filamentous structures. Although TEM investigations<br>
-38-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
have not been performed, the coexistence of those two types of carbon naaostructures looks very<br>
similar to results obtained by others (see,e.g., Melechko, A. V., Merkulov, V. L, Lowndes, D. H.,<br>
Guillorn, M. A., and Simpson M. L., Chem. Phys. Lett., 356,527-33, (2002)). Thus, long non-<br>
aligned filaments may be attributed to CNTs grown by the base-growth mode.<br>
[0209] The highest density, 390 nanotubes µm-2, and most uniform samples were grown on<br>
the Ni/Si/Pt layers on FIG. 30, panel (c)), but the average length was shorter than that of the Pd<br>
and W cases (0.2-1 µm). A longer growth time leads to longer individual structures. In order to<br>
make a quantitative comparison of different samples, a statistical analysis of the top-view SEM<br>
images was performed. The size distributions of the bright spots on the images are plotted in FIG.<br>
31. Bright spots correspond to a top view of catalyst particles on CNT tips. Diameters were<br>
calculated on the basis of the visible area of the spots. A side view of one of the samples is shown<br>
in the insertion, FIG. 32 (e). It is clearly visible mat even the smallest spots correspond to<br>
vertically aligned nanotubes. The diameter varies from a few nanometres to more than 100 run,<br>
and the length ranges from 0.2 µm up to 1 µm. Note that the nanotube diameter is slightly larger<br>
than the observed catalyst particle size, which is statistically more important for thinner objects.<br>
The molybdenum underlayer (FIG. 30, panel (f)) showed the lowest density of the four successful<br>
layers (89 nanotubes µm-2) but also the longest structures (0.5-2 urn). High-resolution SEM<br>
studies (a sample is shown in FIG. 32(e)) revealed that in all four cases VACNT growth occurred<br>
via a tip growth mechanism as evidenced by the presence of the catalyst particles at the tips.<br>
Despite this fact, the grown nanotubes differ in terms of diameter, density and length.<br>
[0210] The particle diameter distribution, FIG. 31, is strongly shifted to smaller diameters<br>
compared to previously published results where a Ni catalyst is deposited directly on the Si<br>
substrate (see, e,g.. Chhowalla, M., Teo, K. B. K.; Ducati,C, Rupesinghe, N. L, Amaratunga, G.<br>
A. J, Ferrari, A. C, Roy, D., Robertson, J. and Milne, W. I.,J.Appl. Phys., 90,5308, (2001); and<br>
Meyyappan, M., Delzeit, L., Cassell, A. M. and Hash, D., Plasma Sources Set Technol, 12,205,<br>
(2003)). The average diameter of-10 nm is much smaller man for Ni catalysed VACNT growth<br>
reported in previously published articles (see, e.g.t Chhowalla, M, et al.t J. Appl Phys., 90,5308,<br>
(2001); Meyyappan, M., et al., Plasma Sources Sci. Technol, 12, 205, (2003); Cassell, A. M., et<br>
al, Nanotechnology, 15, 9, (2004); and Han, J. H., and Kim, H. J., Mater. Sci. Eng. C 16, 65-8,<br>
(2001)). AFM scans were performed after the heating step and showed no significant difference<br>
in surface morphology for the situations with and without the silicon intermediate layer. The<br>
formation of small catalytic particles is not only related to the heating step but is also related to the<br>
etching of these particles by species formed in the plasma (Han, J. H., et al, Thin Solid Films,<br>
-39-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
409,120, (2002); and Choi, J. H., et al., Thin Solid Film, 435,318, (2003)) as well as metal<br>
dusting processes induced by the carbon diffused into the catalytic particles (see Emmenegger, C,<br>
Bonard, J.-M., Mauron, P., Sudan, P,, Lepora, A., Grobety, B., Zuttel, A., and Schlapbach, L.,<br>
Carbon, 41,539-47, (2003)).<br>
[0211] The size distribution of VACNTs present on the samples prepared according to this<br>
example, depends on the presence or absence of amorphous Si as an intermediate layer, in all<br>
samples with an amorphous Si intermediate layer, there is a strong inclination towards forming<br>
VACNTs with very small diameters. The distribution is plotted on a logarithmic scale in FIG. 33<br>
(panel (a)) for the case where Si was used as an intermediate layer. More than 50% of the<br>
nanotubes have diameters 
rapidly for larger diameters. Samples with a Pt underlayer have a broad distribution up to 35 nm<br>
diameter accounting for about 60% of all structures before dropping rapidly. The Mo underlayer<br>
produces a higher percentage of large diameter structures. FIG. 33 (panel (b)) shows the size<br>
distribution for growth on Mo and W underlayers where no Si intermediate layer was present<br>
The probability peaks at 22 nm for growth on W with a FWHM of 20 nm. The distribution for the<br>
Mo underlayer appears to be rather random, which is clearly seen in the SEM images (see FIG. 30<br>
(f)).<br>
Example 7; Electrical measurements of carbon nanotubes<br>
[0212] The electrical integrity of the underlying metal electrode layer after plasma treatment,<br>
and the quality of the metal-nanotube contact are important issues for application of CNTs in<br>
CMOS compatible devices. Three different configurations of electrodes have been used for<br>
carrying out two-probe I-V measurements on the films: (i) both probes on the metal layer; (ii) one<br>
 probe on the metal layer, and one on the nanotube surface; (iii) both probes on the nanotube<br>
surface. FIG. 34 displays the measurement configurations and equivalent DC circuit diagrams for<br>
each of these embodiments. Probes with a tip diameter around 40-50 µm connected to an HP<br>
4156B parameter analyzer via a shielded box were used to carry out the measurements at room<br>
temperature. The probes were brought in contact with the surface (especially for the case of a<br>
CNT surface) with the help of micromanipulators while monitoring the current flow through the<br>
circuit Thus it was ensured that the probe touched only the CNT surface and not the bottom of<br>
the film. The measurements were carried out to get qualitative results, rather than quantitative<br>
information about the film and the metal underlayers. Linear I-V profiles were measured for the<br>
CNT-metal configuration for the Mo and W underlayers (inset of FIG. 35 panel (a)) without the<br>
intermediate Si layer separating the metal from the Ni catalyst. Linearity in the I-V plots suggests<br>
-40-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
ohmic contact between the nanotubcs and the metallic layer. No significant conductance variation<br>
is observed in this case among the three different measurement configurations, which is expected<br>
as the density of the nanostructures is very low. The main part of FIG. 35 panel (a) shows plots<br>
for samples containing an intermediate amorphous silicon layer. The resistance is higher than for<br>
the situation without the amorphous silicon, as could be expected. However, the plots show<br>
predominantly linear behaviour, with slight nonlinearity for tungsten, suggesting varying degrees<br>
of ohmic contact between the CNT and the respective underlying metals.<br>
[0213] FIG. 35 panel (b) presents the deviations of conductance values from the 1/R value for<br>
the metal-metal configuration, represented by the dotted line. The dotted line is used to<br>
differentiate between surface leakage and poor contacts. The individual conductance values of<br>
different measurement configurations for given metal underlayers arc evidenced by straight line<br>
indicators. The high conductance of CNT-CNT configurations for Pt and Pd is likely to be due to<br>
dominant leakage currents through the CNT film which appear in conjunction with the relatively<br>
high CNT density. It may also be related to an increased effective contact probe area due to the<br>
presence of long non-aligned CNTs (FIGs. 31 (c), (d)). On the other hand, the low conductance<br>
value of the CNT-metal configuration for Pt indicates a very poor metal-CNT contact. For W the<br>
inclusion of CNTs in the measurements leads to progressively lower conductance corresponding<br>
to a contact resistance of -150 for the probe-CNT-substrate system. The constant conductance<br>
values in all probe configurations for the case of Mo are probably due to the low density of<br>
nanostructures present per unit area. Similar results were obtained for Ni deposited directly on W<br>
and Mo as discussed above. The low surface density of the CNTs leads to an effective probe-<br>
metal-probe configuration when the electrical measurements are carried out even after the CNT<br>
growth. Growth of individual vertically aligned carbon nanostructures on prefabricated metal<br>
substrates may simplify CNT-based device fabrication processes compared to, for example,<br>
technologies which involve the use of CNT dispersions followed by assembly and integration of<br>
CNTs into functional forms by AFM manipulation, AC field trapping of CNTs or chemical<br>
functionalization. In the present case, the linearity of the I-V characteristics on the Si inclusion<br>
samples proves that the electrical integrity of the metal electrodes after plasma treatment remains<br>
stable. The values of the conductance for the metal-Si-CNT configuration scale as follows: Pt<br><pd according to fig. the circuit diagram metal-metal></pd>
configuration provides information concerning the resistance of the probe and the metal<br>
underlayers. The metal-CNT configuration provides information related to the resistance R3 and<br>
the CNT-CNT configuration provides information related to any surface leakage induced current<br>
flowing through the circuit. For example, as indicated in the equivalent circuit diagram (FIG. 34),<br>
-41-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
if R(CNT-CNT) 
conductance value for fee metal-CNT configuration on Pt metal underlayers reveals that the<br>
resistance related to R3 is the dominant factor. Moreover, because of the dominant R3, Pt may not<br>
be a good choice for growing vertically aligned nanotube-based devices. Due to me low R3<br>
resistance and no R(CNT-CNT) observed, W was found to be the best metal for interconnects<br>
from our set of experiments. Mo and Pd electrodes are also good candidates for fabricating<br>
devices based on CNTs,<br>
Example 8: Influence of catalyst particles<br>
[0214] An important aspect is the type and morphology of the catalyst particles from which<br>
nanostructures grow (see, e.g., Han, J. H., and Kim, H. J, Mater. Sci. Eng. C 16,65-8, (2001);<br>
and Ducati, C, Alexandrou, I., Chhowalla, M., Robertson, J., and Amaratunga, G. A. J., J. Appl.<br>
 Phys., 95,6387, (2004)). In the instant studies, AFM analyses confirmed the formation of 1-5 nm<br>
rough, particle-like structures after the heating step for most of the metal underlayers, but not all<br>
of them catalyze the growth of carbon nanotubes. The formation and dimension of the Ni-<br>
containing islands is therefore not the only deciding factor for the growth of the nanostructures. It<br>
has been reported previously that the catalyst particles are not pure metal, but rather a complex<br>
crystallographic phase containing Ni, and C (Ducati, C, Alexandras I., Chhowalla, M.,<br>
Robertson, X, and Amaratunga, Cr. A. I, J.Appl. Phys., 95,6387, (2004)), and even Si inclusion<br>
does not poison iron-based catalysts (Yao Y., Falk, L. K. L., Morjan, R. E., Nerushev, O. A. and<br>
Campbell, E. E. B., J. Mater. Sci, 15,583-94, (2004)).<br>
[0215] In the instant study, the substrate configuration is changed due to the presence of a<br>
metal underlayer above a thick amorphous silicon oxide layer, which influences the growth of the<br>
individual nanotubes. Chemical mechanisms that may impact on nanotube growth include<br>
intermetallic diffusion, metal silicidation and gas phase reactions in. the CVD chamber (see, e.g.,<br>
Chhowalla, M., et al., W. I, J. Appl. Phys,, 90,5308, (2001); and Meyyappan, M., et al., Plasma<br>
Sources Sci. Technol, 12, 205, (2003)). Following the experimental procedure described herein,<br>
the processes which are responsible for the CNT growth can be divided into two main stages: (i)<br>
the ramping stage—before the samples reach the growth temperature of 700 °C where the metallic<br>
intarlayer interacts to form different alloys under vacuum conditions, and (ii) the growth stage—<br>
after the gaseous mixture is released into the reaction chamber reacting with the catalyst structures<br>
formed during the ramping stage.<br>
-42-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0216] For the catalyst-silicon-metal system, two interaction sites are of interest during the<br>
ramping stage: the interface between the Ni film and the amorphous Si intermediate layer, and the<br>
metal/Si interface. The final product (the catalyst for VACNT growth) of these interactions will<br>
depend on competitive processes defined by the various reaction rates. Aboelfotoh et al.<br>
(Aboelfotoh, M. O., Tawancy, H. M, and d'Heurle,F. M., Appl. Phys. Lett., 50,1453, (1997))<br>
used electron diffraction studies to show that the Ni and Si will not interact at a temperature lower<br>
than 120 °C, and the most favourable compound formed at 600 °C is an amorphous/crystalline<br>
phase of Ni-Si, when 20 am Ni is deposited on top of a 40 nm amorphous Si layer. Details<br>
regarding the Si/metal and metal/SiO2 interfaces are discussed below in separate examples.<br>
[0217] In the second stage, when the gases are introduced into the reaction chamber and the<br>
plasma is ignited, one can expect further modifications to the surface topography and<br>
stoichiometry. In the present version of PECVD with a DC glow discharge, the plasma conditions<br>
in the vicinity of the substrate are defined by the gas type, pressure and gas temperature. The<br>
modification of these parameters results in different nanostructure growth. Similar gas<br>
compositions to those employed herein were used by Bell et al. (Bell, M. S., Lacerda, R. G., Teo,<br>
K. B. K., Rupesinghe, N. L., Amaratunga, G. A. J., Milne, W. L and Chhowalla, M.,Appl. Phys.<br>
Lett., 85,1137, (2004)) who reported that the most dominant species in a C^iNIfe plasma at 700<br>
°C are the neutral molecules C2H2, NH3, H2, N2 and HCN and the positive ions NH3+, C2H2+,<br>
NH2+, NH++, HCN+ and C2H+. The catalytic decomposition of these species provides carbon<br>
atoms and dinners, which will dissolve in the alloyed catalyst producing carbon-based materials.<br>
These materials depend on the catalyst structure which was formed during the first stage and<br>
therefore depend on the metal underlayers. Studies concerning the role of ammonia reveal that its<br>
activity is related to removing amorphous carbon and carbon compounds in the supersaturated<br>
particles (see, e.g, Han, J.H., et at., Thin Solid Films, 409,120, (2002); and Choi, J. H., et al,<br>
Thin Solid Films, 435,318, (2003)). It was also reported that hydrogen derived from NH3 not<br>
only assists in the dehydtogenation of the absorbed hydrocarbons, enhances the surface diffusion<br>
of carbon and etches amorphous carbon, but also influences the growth morphology (Hash, D. B.<br>
and Meyyappan, M., J. Appl Phys., 93,750, (2003)). This study shows that, for the cases when<br>
the growth of VACNTs was not possible, NH3 can either cause etching of all the carbon species<br>
once they attach to the catalyst or leave the carbon species to saturate the catalytic particle forming<br>
amorphous carbon and graphitic deposits. Note that partial concentrations of fragmented and<br>
charged species in the gas phase depend on other discharge conditions such as hot filament gas<br>
activation.<br>
-43-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
Example 8: Cr and Ti metal anderlayers<br>
[0218] According to recently published results, Ti and Cr represent the moat promising metal<br>
underkyers with respect to VACNT growth when Ti or Cr films are deposited on a Si substrate<br>
with native oxide (see, e.g., Cassell, A. M., et al.,Nanotechnology, 15,9, (2004); Han, J. H., and<br>
Kim, H. J., Mater. Sci Eng. C 16,65-8, (2001); and Merkulov, V. I., et al., Appl Phys. Lett., 76,<br>
3555, (2000)). The results presented herein show the opposite behavior. The contradiction<br>
between these results can. be attributed to the growth parameters that differ in the type of<br>
supporting layer below the metal layer, presence/absence of a hot filament system, current density,<br>
heating system and temperature control of the substrate.<br>
[0219] The current density in the instant example was fixed by normal discharge current<br>
density. It is lower, e.g., in comparison to (Cruden, B. A., Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q. and Meyyappan,<br>
M., J Appl Phys., 94,4070 (2003); Teo, K. B. K., et al,Nano Lett., 4,921-6, (2004)) by two<br>
orders of magnitude. This means that heating effects from the plasma, discussed in detail therein,<br>
play a much smaller role in the instant example, and the relative input of ion flux in comparison<br>
with neutral carbon and etching gases is small. On the other hand, this flux is enough to supply<br>
VACNT growth on other metal sub-layers and may not be the main reason for the lack of VACNT<br>
growth. The role of a hot filament in PECVD of nanotubes was investigated in Cruden, B. A., et<br>
al., J. Appl Phys., 94,4070 (2003). It was shown that the hot filament does not improve the<br>
quality of CNTs relative to conventional DC PECVD. Thus, the difference in plasma conditions<br>
seems not to be the main reason for the contradiction. Other sets of possible reasons for the<br>
difference in CNT growth might be related to the difference in chemical reactions at all interfaces<br>
in the system—Si (or SiO2)/Ti, Ti/Ni, Ti/Si. The different substrate composition (Si versus SiO2)<br>
leads to different chemical reactions during the growth process. Cr-Ni and Ti- Ni phase diagrams<br>
show that possible reactions are likely to occur at 700 °C. Reader, et al. (Reader, A. H., van<br>
Ommen, A.H., Weijs, P. 1. W., Wolters,R. A. M., and Oostra,D. J.,Rep. Prog. Phys., 56,1397-<br>
467, (1993)) discussed, in their review of silicidation mechanisms, that the reaction between Ti<br>
and SiO2 at 700 oC will convert Ti into TiSi2. The oxygen is released upwards from the silicon<br>
oxide layer and may inhibit the Ni catalyst film in the given substrate configuration.<br>
[022ft] Moreover, Ti reacts with Si even at room temperature, forming Ti-Si compounds<br>
(Reader, A. H., van Ommen, A. H., Weijs, P. J. W., Wolters, R, A. M., and Oostra, D. I, Rep.<br>
Prog. Phys., 56,1397-457, (1993)), which may explain the inefficiency of the Si interlayer<br>
inclusion in that case in comparison to the other metal underlayers. Presumably, the total amount<br>
of Si is consumed by the Ti undcrlayer before it reaches the growth temperature, forming a<br>
-44-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
TiSi/TiSi2 layer (3 min. ramping to reach 700 °C). The Cr metal underlayer reacts with Si and<br>
forms CrSi2 silicides at 450 °C (Hung, L. S, Mayer, J. W,Pai,C. S., andLau, S. S.,J. Appl.<br>
Phys., 58,1527-36, (1995)). To our knowledge, the reaction mechanisms between as-formed<br>
titanium or chromium silicides and Ni are not well studied. The only information that may be<br>
extracted from the AFM topographic studies on the heated substrates is the larger particle<br>
formation for both cases (Si inclusion and exclusion) in comparison to other metal underlayers.<br>
Apparently for the Cr and Ti layers, the reactions that occur during the ramping stage and the<br>
plasma environment stags collectively do not lead to any favorable conditions to produce carbon<br>
nanostructures either with or without an Si intermediate layer. Such a dramatic difference may be<br>
related to an earlier start of silicon oxide reduction under the metal followed by oxygen diffusion<br>
to the reaction zone. Further particle refinement in the presence of carbon-containing gases may<br>
be suppressed by the excess oxygen, thus hindering the CNT growth. To overcome this effect a<br>
higher carbon flux is required, but our discharge configuration did not allow us to increase the<br>
current density or activate the carbon supply.<br>
[0221] All the speculation on titanium silicide and oxide formation and inhibition of Ni<br>
catalytic activity becomes more important in the case of non-equilibrium heating obtained in<br>
(Meyyappan, M, Delzcit, L., Cassell, A. M. and Hash, D., Plasma Sources Sci. Technol, 12,205,<br>
(2003); and Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q., Cruden, B. A., Li, J., Sarrazin, P. C, Ng, H. T., Han, J. and<br>
Meyyappan, M, Nanotechnology, 15,9, (2004); Cruden, B. A., Cassell, A. M., Ye, Q. and<br>
Meyyappan, M., J. Appl Phys., 94,4070 (2003); and Teo, K. B. K., et al.,Nano Lett., 4, 921-6,<br>
(2004)) when a high power plasma discharge is used for the gas preparation and substrate heating.<br>
In this case, the hottest part of the substrate is the catalyst layer, and the transformation of catalyst<br>
and formation of Ni carbide starts faster than anyother solid statereaction. Catalyst nanoparticles<br>
and CNT embryos have time to start to grow before the Ti or Cr underlayers transform to silicides.<br>
This speculative explanation requires further investigations. A disadvantage of the higher current<br>
density is that it may cause damage of the substrate and grown nanostructures that will strongly<br>
limit the application of the method for the growth of small CNT bundles or individual structures.<br>
Example 9: Pd and Pt metal underlayers<br>
[0222] For the case of Pd and Pt, AFM measurements reveal the formation of small particles<br>
aftcrthe healing step. The phase diagrams show that no predominant alloy formation is likely to<br>
happenbetween Ni-Pd and Ni-Pt at 700 °C (Massalski, T. B., Binary Alloy Phase Diagrams, vol.<br>
2, Fe-Ru to Zn-Zr (1986, Metals Park, OH: American Society for Metals)). In the present layer<br>
configurations, Ni-Si-Pt/Ni-Si-Pd, the first reactions are the transformation of the Pd-Si and Pt-<br>
-45-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
Si interfaces to crystalline silicides (Pd2Si and Pt2Si respectively) (Aboelfotoh, M. O.,<br>
Alessandrini, A. and d'Heurle, M. F., Appl. Phys. Lett., 49,1242, (1986); Reader, A. H., van<br>
Ommen, A. H., Weijs, P. J.W., Wolters, R. A. M., and Oostra, D. J., Rep. Prog. phys., 56,1397-<br>
467, (1993)). Afterwards, at higher temperatures, the top Ni layer will start to interact with the<br>
remaining amorphous Si and most likely with the Ft/Pd silicides, thereby forming binary/ternary<br>
alloys (Kampshoff, E., Waachli, N. and Kern, K., Surf. Sci., 406,103, (1998); Edelman, F.,<br>
Cytemann, C., Brener, R., Eizenberg, M. and Well, R.,J. Appl. Phys., 71,289, (1992); and<br>
Franklin, N. R., Wang, Q., Taobler, T. W., Javey, A., Shim, M. and Dai, H., Appl. Phys. Lett., 81,<br>
913, (2002)). Thus, there is a strong chemical difference between the exclusion and inclusion of<br>
Si for both the Pd and Pt cases. Moreover, the strong reactions that occur, both at the ramping<br>
stage and at the plasma environment stage, collectively result in the formation of nanostructures<br>
with small diameters for the Si inclusion case, but no growth for the Si exclusion case. The latter<br>
case correlates to the bad growth of CNTs on an Ir underlayer observed in (Cassell, A. M., et al.,<br>
Nanotechnology, 15, 9, (2004)).<br>
Example 10: Mo and W metal underlayer<br>
[0223] Mo-Ni and W-Ni phase diagrams show the formation of Ni-rich alloys at temperatures<br>
higher than 700 °C. The integrity of the Ni layer deposited on Mo/W is to some extent affected,<br>
leading to a very low density of individual nanostructures for the Si exclusion case. The lack of<br>
uniformity and low density of nanostructures from these samples agrees with the observations<br>
made by Franklin et al. (Franklin, N, R., Wang, Q., Thobler, T. W., Javey, A., Shim, M. and Dai,<br>
H., Appl Phys. Lett., 81, 913, (2002)) where the presence of W/Mo electrodes under the catalyst<br>
layer inhibited the growth of nanotubes, but disagrees with previously published results where<br>
Mo/W compounds are used as catalysts for nanotube growth (Lee, C. J., Lyu, S. C, Kim, H. W.,<br>
Park, J. W., Jung, H. M., and Park, J., Chem Phys. Lett., 361, 469, (2002); and Moisala, A.,<br>
Nasibulin, A. G. and Kauppinen, E. I., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 15, S3011, (2003)). Mo and W<br>
start to consume Si at ~800 °C and ~950 °C respectively to form silicides (Aboelfotoh, M. O.,<br>
Alessandrini, A. and d'Heurle, M. F., Appl Phys. Lett., 49,1242, (1986); and Murarka, S. P., J.<br>
Vac. Sci. Technol, 17,775, (1980)). At present, the investigated processes are below these<br>
temperatures. Thus by introducing an Si interlayer a stable Si-Mo and Si-W system was achieved<br>
to facilitate a pure Si-Ni surface which apparently enhanced the density of individual<br>
nanostructures in the film. Moreover, these metals form a barrier for Si and Ni diffusion in both<br>
directions and limit the amount of Si that can react with Ni in comparison to the case where the Ni<br>
film is deposited directly on bulk silicon with a native oxide layer.<br>
-46-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0224] The effect of the Si interlayer may be compared with experiments on bulk Si having a<br>
native oxide layer (~1 nm), which were also carried out in the same set-up and under similar<br>
conditions, By comparing the catalyst particle/nanotube density (117/75 counts µm-2) for growth<br>
on an Ni film (10 nm) deposited on silicon substrates with an Si amorphous interlayer (10 nm)<br>
between the metal and the catalyst, we observed that the density of nanostructures is increased by<br>
a factor of ~5,3,2,1 for the Pt, Pd, W and Mo cases respectively. Thus, by timing the thickness<br>
of the amorphous Si interlayer, one can control the density and particle distribution by changing<br>
the stcichiometry of the catalytic particles.<br>
[0225] In summary, nanotobes have been successfully grown on four out of six chosen CMOS<br>
compatible metal underlayers by using silicon as an intermediate layer. An important observation,<br>
from this set of experiments is that the size of the nickel islands formed after the heating sequence<br>
is not the only deciding factor for nanotube growth. Consequently, these experiments show that Si<br>
plays a vital role in the growth of carbon nanotubes. Moreover, the Si layer thickness is an<br>
additional tool for tuning the growth of carbon nanotubes with good quality and quantity as<br>
required for a particular application, along with the growth temperature, chamber pressure and<br>
different gas ratios. In particular, the insertion of a Si layer produces individual vertically aligned<br>
nanotubes with small diameter (
[02261 The studies reported herein showed a poor growth of nanostructures on Ti and Cr<br>
metal underlayers, which is in apparent contradiction with the results obtained by other<br>
laboratories. The main reason for such a difference is attributed to Ti silicidation on the thick<br>
silicon oxide layer with a high release of oxygen that influences the Ni/Ti interface.<br>
[0227] As metal interconnects, a W underlayer was found to be the best underlayer metal for<br>
the production conditions described herein. Nevertheless, structural and electrical integrity seems<br>
to remain intact for all the metal underlayers even after the haish chemical and plasma treatment.<br>
Example 11: Effects of silicidation on the growth of individual free standing carbon<br>
nanofibers<br>
[0228] This example addresses vertically free standing carbon nanotubes/nanofibers and their<br>
integration into functional nanodevices. In this example, growth of individual free-standing<br>
carbon nanofibers on pre fabricated catalyst dots on tungsten and molybdenum metal undedayers<br>
are shown, exploiting an amorphous silicon layer as part of the catalyst layer. In summary, more<br>
man 95% of the catalyst dots facilitated nucleation for growth on the W metal underlayer.<br>
Silicidation occurring during the growth sequence is suggested to play a vital role for growth<br>

kinetics. EDX chemical analysis revealed that the tip of the nanofibers consists of an alloy of Ni<br>
and an underlayer metal and the base shows the signature of Ni, Si and underlayer metal.<br>
[0229] The growth conditions and growth kinetics on different metal underlayers differ<br>
substantially from the growth mechanism that is postulated for Sisubstrates. This example<br>
provides an explanation for the growth results on W and Mo in terms of silicide formation.<br>
Individual nanofibers were characterized in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The<br>
electertal compositions were determined by fine probe energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy<br>
(EDX).<br>
[0230] Oxidized silicon substrates 1 cm2 in area with an oxide thickness of 400 nm were used.<br>
First the metal (W or Mo) underlayer was evaporated directly onto the substrate by electron beam<br>
evaporation to a thickness of 50 mm. Stripes and dots (100 nm and 50 nm edge to edge distance)<br>
were fabricated by e-beam lithography. Experimental details are further described in Kabir, et al.,<br>
Nanotechnology, 17,790-794, (2006), incorporated herein by reference. An intermediate 10 nm<br>
thick amorphous silicon layer covered by 10 nm of Ni was used, to catalyze growth. A DC<br>
PECVD chamber was used to grow the nanostructures. The experimental set-up and detailed<br>
growth procedure have been described in Morjan, R. E., et al., Chemical Physics Letters, 383,<br>
385, (2004). The nanotube growth was carried out in a gaseous C2H2-NH3 (1:5) mixture at 5 mbar<br>
chamber pressure at 700 °C for 20 minutes for all of the experimental runs discussed here. The<br>
substrates were first heated up to 700 °C under low vacuum conditions (0.13 mbar) with a 3.8<br>
°C/second ramping rate (healing stage), After growth, the samples were cooled down to room<br>
temperature before air exposure. As-grown nanotubes from, pre-fabricated dots were men imaged<br>
with a JEOL JSM 6301F scanning electron microscope (SEM) or a JEOL ULTRA 55 SEM.<br>
Samples were then gently rubbed onto a TEM grid to transfer the grown fibers from the substrate<br>
to the grid. Individual fibers were then investigated by TEM and EDX.<br>
[0231] Morphology changes of the patterned substrate/catalyst layer may occur during the<br>
heating step of the growth sequence, but no predominant catalyst breakup or cluster formation was<br>
observed, which is in good agreement with experiments in which catalyst films were used. FIG.<br>
36 shows SEM images of the substrates after the growth sequence for the case of W. FIGs. 36<br>
panels (a), (c) and (d) show the micrograph of grown carbon nanofibers (CNF) from patterned 100<br>
nm side length dots with 500 nm pitch, 50 nm length with 1 urn pitch, and 50 nm length with 500<br>
nm pitch, respectively. As can be seen, more than 95% of the catalyst dots nucleated for growth.<br>
The catalyst from 100 nm dots splits, and multiple CNFs up to 4 fibers per dots were observed.<br>
- 48 -<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
CNFs grown from 50 nm dots are individual and vertically well aligned. There are some instances<br>
of multiple CNFs growing from a single dot (~ 2%). All cases where nanofibers grew showed a<br>
tip growth mechanism as evidenced by the presence of the catalyst particles at the tips. No<br>
predominant pitch induced effects are evident for 1 um and 500 nm pitch respectively. Since an<br>
amorphous Si layer is included as a part of the catalyst layer on top of metal underlayers, the<br>
interactions between the amorphous Si and the two metal layers (silicidation) are important<br>
processes for defining the final phase of the catalyst and its catalytic activity. An example is<br>
shown in FIG. 37 panel (b) where only Ni was deposited on W, resulting in no catalytic activity<br>
and no growth.<br>
[0232] It is reported mat at room temperature the stress present in the deposited film, is due to<br>
the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients but at elevated temperature silicidation occurs<br>
resulting in net volume shrinkage. The volume decrease can be very large and this could lead to<br>
large tensile stresses in the suicided films. After heating the tensile stress for Ni and Mo silicides<br>
is found to he ~ 0.25 x 10-9 dyne/cm2 and ~ 0.10 x 10-9 dyne/cm2 respectively, which are of the<br>
same order. This perhaps explains why no catalysts broke up during the heating process; the<br>
break up into smaller patches is controlled by the growth kinetics rather man induced by the film<br>
stress (see inset of FIG. 36(a)).<br>
[0233] Silicides can be formed at elevated temperatures either by a solid state reaction<br>
between a metal and silicon deposited on each other, or by codepositing metal and Si. Transition<br>
metal silicides have been extensively studied and explored due to their usefulness as high<br>
temperature materials. The investigated metal underlayers and the Ni catalyst layer should<br>
undergo silicidation during nanofiber growth in this case. For commonly used silicides, when a<br>
thin film of metal M reacts with a thick Si layer the thermodynamically stable phase is MSi2.<br>
Conversely, when a thin Si film reacts with a thick metal layer, a thennodynamically stable metal-<br>
rich phase is formed. When a thin metal film reacts with a thin Si layer where there is neither<br>
excess metal nor excess Si present, the equilibrium phase will be determined by the ratio of metal<br>
atoms to Si atoms. For a ternary system as described herein, the situation is complicated since two<br>
or more phases are likely to occur simultaneously. In this case the interface reactions and<br>
diffusivities will define the stable phase.<br>
[0234] For W-Si and Mo-Si systems, Si is the predominant diffusing species for the formation<br>
of corresponding silicides. On the contrary, Ni is the metal diffusion species in Si at elevated<br>
temperatures. All moving species are thus presumed to be moving down towards the substrate in<br>
-49-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
this system. The ramp rate at which the temperature of the substrate reaches the growth<br>
temperature might also play a role in defining the chemical phase of the silicides. AD extensive<br>
study on the reaction of Si with W performed by Nishikawa et al., (Nishikawa, O.; Tsunashima,<br>
Y.; Nomura, E.; Horie, S.; Wada, M.; Shibata, M.; Yoshimura, T.; Uemori, R., Journal of Vacuum<br>
Science &amp; Technology B (Microelectronics Processing and Phenomena) (1983), 1, (I), 6) and<br>
Tsong et al. (Tsong, T. T.; Wang, S. C; Liu, F. H,; Cheng, H.; Ahmad, M, Journal of Vacuum<br>
Science &amp; Technology B (Microelectronics Processing and Phenomena) (1983), 1, (4), 915) by<br>
field ion microscopy, revealed that Si deposition on W is likely to result in the tetragonal<br>
polycrystalline WSi2 structure at ~ 700 °C, which is also the temperature used herein. However,<br>
Tsong et al. reported that a change of silicide phase occurs if heating is extended beyond -30 s.<br>
[0235] When silicon is the dominant diffusing species, it can continue to diffuse in at a<br>
location well beneath the Mo/W interface thus forming silicides at a distance from the interface.<br>
Thus at least two binary layers: Ni-Mo/W, and Si-Mo/W can be expected to form. We suggest<br>
that a Si-Mo/W layer provides a platform for the Ni rich W layer (Ni-W layer) to catalyze and<br>
facilitate CNF growth; no growth is observed for the case when Ni was deposited directly on W as<br>
shown in FIG. 36(b). To support mis hypothesis, a TEM investigation on the nanofibers grown on<br>
W metal underlayers was carried out as depicted in the FIG. 26B. FIG. 26B panel (a) represents<br>
the typical structure of a CNF from a patterned catalyst of 30 rtm diameter. The catalyst Ni<br>
particle at the CNF tip usually had a conical shape. EDX point analysis was carried out both at<br>
the tip of the CNF and at its base as shown in the FIG. 26B panels (b) and (c) respectively. The<br>
EDX spectra reveal no characteristic peak representing Si at the tip of the fibers (FIG. 26B panel<br>
(b)). W was found to coexist withNi catalyst at the tip. However a small amount of Si is detected<br>
at the base of the fibers (FIG. 26B panel (c)). Presence of silicon in the catalyst particles (both at<br>
the tip and at the base) regardless of catalyst particle type (Ni/Fe catalysts on an Si substrate) is<br>
reported by cross sectional TEM observations. It can be extrapolated from these observations that<br>
the particle at the tip of the CNF was part of the metallurgical layer from which the CNF grew and<br>
since in the sample the content of only Ni and W but no Si at the tip was observed, it can be<br>
surmised that the metallurgical layer for growth in this case was a Ni-W system. It is therefore<br>
proposed that a W-silicide layer has provided means for the Ni-W layer to nucleate for growth. In<br>
the model for tip growth suggested by Melechko et al., (Melechko, A. V.; Merkulov, V. L;<br>
Lowndes, D. H.; Guillorn, M. A.; Simpson, M. L, Chem. Phys. Lett., 2002,356, (5-6), 527) the<br>
interface between catalytic particle and substrate is important By having a silicide rather than a<br>
pure metal interfacing the catalytic Ni-W particle, we would alter these crucial interface<br>
conditions significantly- apparently in favour of CNF growth. The Mo metal underlayer behaves<br>
-50-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
the same as the W metal underlayer in many ways; producing CNF with almost the same statistics<br>
in terms of diameter, length, growth yield etc. Mo also behaves similar to W with regards to<br>
silicidation. It is therefore proposed that the explanation regarding the W metal underlayer is<br>
valid for Mo as well.<br>
[0236] In conclusion, results on CNF PECVD growth have been presented in terms of metal-<br>
Si-metal reactions, silicide phases and kinetics. Silicidation is likely to play a vital rolein<br>
defining the growth mechanism of nanostructures, where a silicide can enable the upper<br>
metallurgical layer to nucleate. EDX analysis supports this conclusion for the case of a Ni on Si<br>
on W system. Breaking up of the catalyst particles is found to be more related to growth kinetics<br>
rather than the thermal expansion coefficient of different metals. The silicidation processes for<br>
thin film metal-Si-metal systems are complex and involve more than one mechanism governing<br>
their kinetics.<br>
Example 12: Controlling nanostructers<br>
[0237] This example describes control of CNT/CNF diameter and length distribution in<br>
PECVD growth from a single geometrical design. Results were obtained by controlling the<br>
diameter of catalyst dots by the shot modulation technique of electron beam lithography. The<br>
method comprises fabrication of dots of different sizes from one single geometrical design and the<br>
consequent effects on growth of vertically aligned carbon nanofibers on different metal<br>
underlayers. Statistical analysis was undertaken to evaluate the uniformity of the grown CNF<br>
structures by the PECVD system, and to examine the achievable uniformity in terms of diameter<br>
and length distributions as a function of different metal underlayers. It is possible to control the<br>
variation of diameter of grown nanofibers to a precision of 2 ± 1 nm, and the results are<br>
statistically predictable. The developed technology is suitable for fabricating carbon basednano-<br>
electro mechanical structures (NEMS).<br>
[0238] The electrical characteristics (I-V) and switching dynamics of the fabricated devices<br>
depend on a number of design and fabrication related parameters. Since the CNF/CNT is the<br>
active part of the device, both the diameter and the length of the CNTs/CNFs are of great<br>
importance. Device geometry is depicted in FIG. 25, which shows an electron microscopy image<br>
of a fabricated vertical "nanorelay" structure where the parameters that influences the device<br>
characteristics are shown. A single CNF is grown between two drain electrodes. The drains are<br>
separated from the source electrode by 400 nm thick SiO2 insulator. Charge can be induced info<br>
the CNF by applying a voltage to the drain electrode to actuate the CNF. For such two terminal<br>
-51-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
devices, the pull-in voltage is defined by the balance of the elastic, electrostatic and the van der<br>
Waals forces (Dequesnes, M; Rotkin, S.V.; Alum, N. R., Nanotechnotogy, 13(1), 120, (2002)).<br>
Since all these three forcea are strongly correlated with the diameter and the length of the grown<br>
structures and these are the parameters that can be controlled experimentally to a certain extent.<br>
In this example, is described (a) development of a technology to vary the diameter of the CNFs<br>
from one single geometrical design with a precision of 2 ± 1 nm; (b) growing the CNFs on<br>
different metal underlayers to realise the optimum the CMOS platform for CNFs growth; (c)<br>
statistical spread and control over length distribution of the grown structures; and (d) pitch<br>
limitations for mass production of high density parallel structures.<br>
Sample preparation and characterization;<br>
[0239] To fabricate the catalysts dots, the shot modulation technique of electron beam<br>
lithography is used to define the catalyst dimensions. The shot modulation technique is a robust<br>
technique that has been used for fabricating different kinds of nano-structures. For example, by<br>
varying the dose applied during the exposure of the two electrode regions, the width of the gap<br>
between them can be controlled with nanometer precision (see, e.g., Liu, K,; Avouris, P.;<br>
Bucchignano, J.; Mattel, R.; Sun, S.; Michl, J., Applied Physics Letters, 80(5), 865, (2002)). The<br>
experiment described in this example uses the state of the art electron beam lithography system,<br>
the JBX-9300FS model. The system is capable of keeping the 3pot size down to ~6 nm at 500 pA<br>
probe current at 100 kV operating voltage. The system has a height detection module which is<br>
used to ensure the accuracy of the focus point of the e-beam spot on the entire work piece and<br>
compensate for the height variation of the resists that usually occurs during spin coating of the<br>
resists.<br>
[0240] Oxidized silicon substrates 1 cm2 area with an oxide thickness of 400 nm, were used.<br>
First the metal (= Mo, Nb, or W) electrode layer was evaporated directly on the substrate by<br>
electron beam evaporation to a thickness of 50 cm. Sheet resistance measurements were carried<br>
out on the deposited films. Double layer resists system, consisting of 10% co-polymer and 2%<br>
PMMA resists, were then spin coated and baked respectively. The shot modulation experiments<br>
were then carried out on initial dots of 10 X10 arrays with 50 nm square geometry. The same<br>
block was then distributed in an array of 8 X 8 matrix and the dose of electron beam was varied<br>
linearly with aninterval of 100 µC/cm2 starting from 500 µC /cm2. No proximity corrections<br>
were made for dose compensation. Inside the matrix, the columns represent the same dose while<br>
the rows represent different doses. The samples were exposed and then developed in a standard<br>
developer, IPA:H2O (93:7) for 3 min.<br>
-52-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
[0242] The samples were then mounted in an e-beatn evaporator, and an intermediate 10 am<br>
thick amorphous silicon layer was deposited prior to deposition of the Ni catalyst layer. After the<br>
e-beam evaporation, lift off processes were carried out in Acetone at 60 °C, then EPA, and<br>
completing the sequence by rinsing in DI water and N2 blow drying.<br>
[0243] A DC plasma-enhanced CVD chamber was used to grow the nanostructures. The<br>
DC plasma-enhanced CVD chamber was used to grow the nanostructures. The experimental set-<br>
up and detailed growth procedure have been described previously (see, e.g., Morjan, R, E;<br>
Maltsev, V.; Nerushev, 0.;Yao, Y.; Falk, L. K. L,; Campbell, E. E. B., Chemical Physics Letters,<br>
383(3-4), 385, (2004)). The nanotube growth was carried out in a C2H2:NH3 gaseous (1:5)<br>
mixture at 5 mbar chamber pressure at 700 °C for 20 minutes for all of the experimental runs. The<br>
substrates were first heated up to 700 °C under low vacuum conditions (0.13 mbar) with a 3.8 °C<br>
s -1 ramping rate (annealing stage). Once the final temperature was reached, the C2H2:NH3 gas<br>
mixture was introduced into the chamber and 1 kV was applied to the anode to induce plasma<br>
ignition. After growth, the samples were cooled down to room temperature before air exposure.<br>
Nanotubes grown in this way from pre-fabricated dots were then imaged with a JEOL JSM 630 IF<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM) and JEOL ULTRA 55 SEM. All the experiments were<br>
performed repeatedly to verify their reproducibility.<br>
[0244] After each step of the experimental sequences, samples were characterized by SEM, as<br>
portrayed in FIG. 38. FIG. 38 (a) represents the 10 X10 array of fabricated dots prior to the<br>
heating step for growth. As can be seen from the figure, the square geometry rounded up to dots.<br>
FIG. 38 (b) was taken after the heating step prior to exposing the sample to plasma and gas<br>
mixture for growth. Not much seem to happen during the heating step and squared dots remain<br>
intact. FIG. 38 (c) depicts the results obtained after the growth sequence. The growth yields more<br>
than 98% at the dose scale of 1200 nC/cm2. Predominant vertical growth of CNFs was observed.<br>
However, for some instances, slight angular deviation from perpendicularity of the grown<br>
structures was also observed. In order to differentiate the impact of the insertion of a layer of<br>
amorphous Si as part of catalyst, a set of experiments in which only Ni catalyst was deposited on<br>
W substrates was carried out As can be seen from FIG. 38 (d), no growth of CNF is evident.<br>
Such results are also reported in (Kabir, M. S.; Morjan, R E.; Nerushev, O, A.; Lundgren, P.;<br>
Bengtsson, S.; Enokson, P.; CampbelL E. E. B, Nanotechnology, 16(4), 458, (2005)).<br>
-53-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
carried out on a geometrical design set to 50 nm square. All of the metal underiayers gave<br>
reproducible results. The electron beam exposure was carried out at 500 pA, 100 kV and thereby<br>
the beam step size was set to equal a spot size of ~6 am. HG. 39 describes the catalyst diameter<br>
after metal evaporation as a function of irradiated electron dose during the exposure. The dose<br>
was varied by varying the dwell time of the beam on each exposure shot Linear increment of the<br>
catalyst diameter as a function of electron dose is expected as the dose was varied linearly ranging<br>
from 500 µC/cm2 to 1200 µC/cm2. For the tungsten layer, below a threshold of 800 µC/cm2<br>
electron dose, no catalyst structure was observed. The observation can be explained in terms of<br>
how the electron energy is transferred to the resists. During an exposure, a series of elastic and<br>
inelastic scattering events determine the volume over which energy is deposited and the resist<br>
exposed. When the feature sizes are small, this effect becomes even more crucial to define the<br>
final exposed pattern. On the other hand, the energy deposited to the resists can be varied simply<br>
by keeping the beam 'on' the spot for a longer period. However, in addition to the beam induced<br>
parameters, the end outcome of the fabricated structures is determined by experimental parameters<br>
like resists thickness, resist developer, soiid angle of the metal evaporation, etc. Still, there exist a<br>
minimum threshold point below which not enough energy will be transferred to the resists to be<br>
developed in the resist developer and no metal structure appears after metal deposition and lift off<br>
process. This is what is observed in FIG. 39. No structure appeared below 800 µC/cm2 electron<br>
dose. Additionally, this threshold point depends not only on the type of the resists itself but also<br>
on other parameters such as substrate material, beam current density, beam pitch, etc.<br>
Nevertheless, the electron beam lithography technique not only facilitated extremely high<br>
positional precision capability (
diameter from a single design.<br>
Growth on different metal underiayers:<br>
[0245] FIGs. 40 and 41 show an SEM of nanotubes grown from catalyst dots on different<br>
metal underiayers fabricated at a dose of 800 µC/cm2 and 1200 µC/cm2 respectively, for two<br>
different pitches (500 ran and 1 Tm) in each case. Doses below 800 µC/cm2 did not give any<br>
growth of CNFs, a fact which correlates well with the observation of lack of catalyst particles after<br>
lithography under these conditions (see FIG. 39). The structures of the grown CNFs were very<br>
similar for the Mo and W metal underiayers except for the fact that the W metal underiayers<br>
required a slightly higher dosage to reach the same yield. For the case of tungsten, at the dose of<br>
800 µC/cm2, CNFs grew from more man 60% of the total catalyst dots. At even higher doses,<br>
more man 97% catalyst dots act as nucleation sites for growth of nanotubes. CNFs grew from<br>
-54-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
supported catalyst particles via a tip-growth mechanism in the followed conditions. The block<br>
with 500 nm pitch, on the other hand, yielded more than 85% growth from catalyst cites produced<br>
at 800 µC/cm2. This incidence correlates with the proximity effect of the electron dose, and<br>
resulted in higher energy deposited to the resists during the processing.<br>
[0246] Mo and W provided a stable platform for Si-Ni to interact, forming silicides at the<br>
growth temperature without breaking into little droplets. This result is different from the<br>
observaticas by Yudasaka et al. (see Yudasaka, M.;Kikuchi, R.; Ohki, Y.; Ota, E.; Yoshinmura, S.;<br>
Applied Physics Letters, 70(14), 1817, (1997)), Merkulov et al, (see Merkolov, V. I.; Lowndes, D.<br>
H.; Wei, Y. Y.; Eres, G.; Voelkl, E, Applied Physics Letters, 76(24), 3555, (2000)) and Teo et al.<br>
(see Teo, K. B. K., et al, Nanotechnology, 14(2), 204, (2003)) where, for initially large dots,<br>
multiple droplets were formed. As the size of the dots is reduced, the number of Ni droplets also<br>
decreases. Merkulov et al. observed ~300 nm critical diameter and Teo et al. observed ~100 nm<br>
critical diameter below which single VACNFs are grown. In all cases, only Ni was used as<br>
catalyst layer. In addition, in their case, formation of droplets was the necessary precursor for the<br>
catalytic growth of nanofibers. On the contrary, no droplet formation is observed after the heating<br>
step (see FIG. 38 (b)). Similar behaviour was observed even for the case where films of catalyst<br>
were used (Kabir, M. S.; Morjan, R. E.; Nerushev, O. A.; Lundgren, P.; Bengtsson, S.; Enokson,<br>
P.; Campbell, E. E. B. Nanotechnology, 16(4), 458, (2005)). Therefore, these observations<br>
suggest that the formation of droplets may not be the only criterion for catalyst nucleation.<br>
[0247] The binary phase diagram of Nb-Si indicates that no reaction should occur at the<br>
growth temperature used in the experiment (see, e. g., Zhao J C, Jackson M R and Peluso L A,<br>
Mater. Sci Eng. A 372,21, (2004)). Therefore, a Nb metal underlayer is also expected to<br>
facilitate a stable platform for Si and Ni to interact. The suicide formation step is therefore not<br>
expected to be the reason for the poor growth results on the Nb metal underlayer. There are a<br>
number of parameters that would influence the growth results including details of how the metal<br>
underlayer and the catalyst layers are deposited.<br>
[0248] Furthermore, a Si layer is present between the Ni catalyst and the metal underlayers.<br>
Ni undergoes chemical reactions with Si at growth temperature 750 °C and forms mono/di<br>
silicidates (Kabir, M. S.; Morjan, R. E.; Nerushev, O.A.; Lundgren, P.; Bengtsson, S.; Enokson,<br>
P.; Campbell, E. E. B. Nanotechnology, 16(4), 458, (2005)) and remains stable. The observation<br>
may also perhaps be due to the fact that below a critical dot size (in this case ~50 nm has rather<br>
small volume) the breakup does not occur due to increase in the surface energy, which is larger<br>
-55-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
than the reduction of strain energy imposed by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient of<br>
different metal layers at a given temperature. Nevertheless, alter the acetylene is introduced, the<br>
VACNF growth, begins. Growth mechanisms follow the tip growth model as is evident from the<br>
bright spot at the tip of nanotubes. Only rarely has formation of multiple CNFs from single dots<br>
been observed. Since the occurrence of such multiples of CNFs was less than 3%, the<br>
phenomenon is considered to be negligible and remains to be explained.<br>
Statistical evaluation<br>
[0249] All experiments were performed on 72 blocks of 10 X10 arrays of catalyst dots for<br>
each election dose. To evaluate the structural uniformity, especially the tip diameter and the<br>
height distribution of the grown CNF structures, statistical analysis was undertaken. The<br>
statistical distribution was carried out on 75 randomly chosen CNFs for each electron dose. The<br>
results from statistical distributions are summarized in FIG. 42 and FIG. 43. FIG. 42 represents<br>
the grown CNF tip diameter as a function of catalyst dimension. Standard deviations of the<br>
measured data are shown as error bars for obtained mean values. For instance, the obtained mean<br>
value for the tip diameter of the grown CNFs is 26 nm (W substrate) from -48 ran diameter<br>
catalyst with a standard deviation of ± 3.5 nm. FIG. 42 also represents a benchmark to predict the<br>
results with a statistical accuracy of ± 3 nm, which we believe is sufficiently good data to fabricate<br>
NEMS structures with statistically predictablelI-Vcharacteristics. Moreover, almost linear<br>
dependence of the tip diameter on the size of catalyst dimension, which is again dependent on the<br>
deposited electron dose of the EBL, proves to be a robust technique to control the tip diameter<br>
with an accuracy of ± 2 nm.<br>
[0250] As evident from the figures, diameters of the grown CNFs are roughly 50% smaller<br>
than the initial catalyst size. This observation is consistent with, others (see Teo, K. B. K., et al.,<br>
Nanotechnology, 14(2), 204, (2003)). According to the spherical nanocluster assumption (Teo, K.<br>
B, K., et al., Nanotechnology, 14(2), 204, (2003)), it is possible to calculate the expected diameter<br>
of the grown CNF by equating the patterned catalyst with the volume of a sphere. The calculated<br>
diameters are thus plotted in dotted lines. The theoretical plot gave very good agreement with the<br>
average experimental values for diameters when the critical thickness for the catalyst was set to 4<br>
nm. This is 60% reduction from the initial thickness of the catalyst film (initial 10 nm thick Ni<br>
catalyst). Moreover, this observation fortifies the fact that the silicidacion occurs during the<br>
growth process, and dominates and controls the exact thickness of the catalytically active film.<br>
Statistical analysis on length distributions of the grown CNFs showed Gaussian distributions for<br>
all cases. The most pragmatic parameter from the distributions, the FWHM of length distribution,<br>
-56-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
is plotted as a function of catalyst dimensions in FIG. 43. The spread of the Gaussian fit is also<br>
indicated by bar on each point. It is apparent from the Figure that height distributions for W and<br>
Mo almost overlap with each other. Whereas Ni produced more than half the height compare to<br>
other metals. This difference for different metals underlayers suggest mat the different metals<br>
give rise to different pace to the catalytic activities of the catalysts resulting different length<br>
distributions. Moreover, the spread of length distribution is of the order of 100 nm which is<br>
substantially better than the reported value by others (see Teo, K. B. K., et al.,Nanotechnology,<br>
14(2), 204, (2003)) where spreads of the order of microns were reported. The height variations as<br>
a function of catalyst diameter show a predominantly straight line, which is not surprising as the<br>
volume of the catalyst does not increase significantly as a function of catalyst dimension to<br>
produce significant impact on height.<br>
Diameter and length distributions<br>
[0251] All experiments were performed on 72 blocks of 10 x 10 arrays of catalyst dots for<br>
each electron dose (7200 dots for each dose condition). The tip diameter and nanofibre length<br>
were determined for at least SO randomly chosen structures for each electron, dose. The results are<br>
summarized in FIGs. 42 and 43.<br>
[0252] The length of grown nanotubes ranged from 800 nm to 900 nm. The tip diameter was<br>
ranging from 20 nm to 70 nm. Only a few nanotubes did not grow normal to the substrate. The<br>
grown fibers tend to have larger diameter at the bottom and smaller at the top, thereby forming<br>
conic shape nanofiber structures with conical angle less than 20. Apparently, e-field alignment is<br>
related to number of CNTs growing from each dot. When examining the critical size for the<br>
nucleation of single CNFs, it was discovered that there were still some instances of multiple (i.e.,<br>
double) CNFs from some catalyst dots (below 3%). Mo substrate produced better yield (more<br>
than 80%) at the same electron dose. Structural configurations of the grown structures did not<br>
seem to differ between Mo and W metal underlayers except where the W metal underlayers<br>
required little higher dosage to reach the same yield. This could be related to the conductivity of<br>
the metal substrates. Nb was chosen as an exotic material simply for the purpose of a comparative<br>
analysis with the other metals. At dose 800 µC/cm2, not more than 30% dots nucleated for<br>
growth, but this trend remains the same at higher dosage.<br>
[0253] FIG. 42 shows the CNF average tip diameter' as a function of catalyst dimension (i.e.,<br>
electron dose). The error bars represent standard deviations in nanometres. An almost linear<br>
dependence of the tip diameter on the catalyst size is observed. Since the catalyst size can be<br>
-57-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
controlled by adjusting the electron dose in the EBL, this proves to be a robust technique to<br>
control the tip diameter from a single design geometry with an average standard deviation of ±4<br>
nm. As is evident from FIG. 42, the diameters of the grown CNFs are roughly 50% smallerthan<br>
the initial catalyst size. The base diameter is slightly smaller than the diameter of the catalyst with<br>
an average value ranging from 40 to 50 nm as a function of dose, i.e., Approximately 1.5 times<br>
larger diameter than at the tip (corresponding to a conical angle of about 0.5* for 1 urn long<br>
fibres). This observation is consistent with related studies where carbon nanofibres were grown<br>
on Ni catalyse of 100 nm dimensions and larger deposited on a doped silicon substrate with an 8<br>
nm thick oxide barrier where the measured tip diameterswere about 0.5 of metal catalyst diameter<br>
(Teo K B K, et al.,Nanotechnology, 14, 204, (2003)). That earliar work was more focused on<br>
large diameter structures (larger than 100 nm). The measured standard deviations were smaller<br>
than in our case; however, this is more related to the lithographic challenges of producing<br>
sinall
takes an approximately conical shape (Yao Y, Falk L K L, MorjanR E, Nerushev O A and<br>
Campbell E B B, J. Microsc, 219,69-75, (2005)) and therefore the volume of catalyst material<br>
enclosed within, the CNF tip can easily be estimated. From TEM studies we can estimate the<br>
height of the cone to be approximately 40 nm for a 25 nm diameter CNF. The estimated catalyst<br>
volume then turns out to be approximately one-fifth of the originally deposited catalyst dot<br>
volume. The remaining catalyst material is present at the base of the CNF in the form of small Ni<br>
particles embedded in a carbon' dome' or in a thin layer of Ni between the carbon 'dome' and the<br>
amorphous silica layer coating the silicon wafer (Yao Y, et al., J. Microsc. ,219,69-75, (2005)).<br>
[0254] The measured lengths of the grown CNFs showed Gaussian distributions for all cases.<br>
The average length is plotted as a function of catalyst dimension in FIG. 43. The standard<br>
deviation is indicated by the bar on each point. It is apparent from the figure that the height<br>
distributions for W and Mo almost overlap with each other. On the other hand, the nanofibres<br>
grown on the Nb underlayer were only slightlymore than half the height of the fibres grown on the<br>
other metals. The spread of the length distribution for W and Mo metal underlayers varied from 8<br>
to 15% with an average standard deviation of 11%. In contrast, for the Nb metal underlayer it<br>
varied up to 20% with an average standard deviation of 16%. There is no dependence of the<br>
height of the structures on the catalyst diameter within the range that we have investigated.<br>
Pitch limitations:<br>
[0255] The ultimate limit for integrating such densely populated structures was considered.<br>
Experiments were carried out on pitches with 1Tm, 500 nm and 100 nm distances to evaluate the<br>
-58-<br><br>
WO 2006/115453	PCT/SE2006/000487<br>
pitch induced effects. No significant variations were observed between the 1 Tm and 500 ran<br>
pitch in terms of height and diameter distributions However, 50 nm dots with 100 ran pitch,<br>
revealed characteristics that resembled growth from film of catalyst. FIG. 44 depicts the results<br>
obtained. FIG. 44 (a) represents the catalysts after the heating step where neither break-up of the<br>
dots nor predominant clusters formation (catalysts conglomeration) are observed. On the other<br>
hand, CNFs tend to come close in contact with the next neighbors while growing; This effect is<br>
perhaps due to the local field gradient that occurs on the CNFs during the growth period. The<br>
pitch limit on the reliable production of individual carbon nanofires grown from 50 nm catalyst<br>
dots is therefore seen to lie between 100 and 500 nm.<br>
[0256] In conclusion, use of the shot modulation technique to define the catalyst diameter<br>
exceptionally precisely, thereby controlling the CNFs diameter and length, has been demonstrated.<br>
As predicted by theoretical models, the switching dynamics are sensitive to geometrical<br>
parameters. This example demonstrates experimentally that it is possible to tune these two<br>
important parameters related to fabrication of C-NEMS structures, diameter and length, up to the<br>
limit of ± 2 run for diameter, and a spread of ± 50 nm for length.<br>
[0257] Two CMOS compatible metals, Mo and W, as metal underlayers substantiated to<br>
produce good quality CNFs suitable for C-NEMS device fabrication. These metals to produce<br>
low ohmic contacts with CNFs. Therefore they arc expected to create good low ohmic contact<br>
with the grown CNF structures, which is essential for device fabrication. On the other hand, Nb<br>
did not produce high quality and reliable results and thereby is preferably not used as source metal<br>
underlayer. The developed technology appears to possess a limit of 100 nm pitch for large scale<br>
integration.<br>
[0258] The results obtained from arrays of same structures on entire ~ 1 cm area were found to<br>
be reproducible for each electron dose scale. These positive results also indicate the potential of<br>
the technique to be used for wafer level integration of the CNFs based NEMS structures. In terms<br>
of number, length and diameter, control over the process is sufficient to carry out large scale<br>
production of carbon based NEMS structures with predictable statistical variations. The<br>
technology will facilitate study of pull in and pull out processes associated with electrical<br>
properties of NEMS structures.<br>
