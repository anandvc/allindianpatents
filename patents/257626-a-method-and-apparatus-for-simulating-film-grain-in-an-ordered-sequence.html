				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/628,477, filed on November 16, 2004 and entitled "FILM GRAIN SEI MESSAGE INSERTION FOR BIT-ACCURATE SIMULATION IN A VIDEO SYSTEM," which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to video encoders and video decoders and, more particularly, to film grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate film grain simulation in a video system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Film Grain Management (FGM, also referred to as Film Grain Technology, or FGT) has been presented as a new tool that allows encoding the grain in motion picture film by means of a parameterized model to be transmitted as parallel information for use by a video decoder. To support FGM, the Fidelity Range Extension (FRExt) Amendment to the ITU-T Rec. H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 | MPEG-4 AVC | Joint Video Team (JVT) standard (hereinafter the "H.264 standard") has defined a Film Grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message. The SEI message describes the film grain characteristics regarding attributes such as size and intensity, and allows a video decoder to simulate the film grain look onto the decoded picture. The H.264 standard specifies which parameters are present in the film grain SEI message, how to interpret the parameters, and the syntax for encoding the SEI message in binary format. However, the H.264 standard does not specify the exact procedure to simulate film grain upon reception of the film grain SEI message by a video decoder. It is to be appreciated that FGM can be used jointly with any other video coding method, since FGM utilizes parallel information, transmitted from an encoder, that does not affect the decoding process.<br><br>
In FGM, the encoder models the film grain of the video sequence and the decoder simulates the film grain according to the received information. The encoder can use FGM to enhance the quality of the compressed video when there is difficulty retaining the film grain. Additionally, the encoder has the option of removing or attenuating the film grain prior to encoding in order to reduce the bit-rate.<br>
Film grain simulation aims at synthesizing film grain samples that simulate the look of original film content. Unlike film grain modeling, which is entirely performed at the encoder, film grain simulation is performed at the decoder. Film grain simulation is done after decoding the video stream and prior to display. Images with added film grain are never used within the decoding process. Being a post-processing method, synthesis of simulated film grain on the decoded images for the display process is not specified in the H.264 standard. The film grain simulation process includes the decoding of film grain supplemental information, transmitted in a film grain SEI message as specified by the Fidelity Range Extensions Amendment of the H.264 standard mentioned above.<br>
In a previously disclosed prior art approach to film grain simulation, a set of specifications was disclosed to allow bit-accurate film grain simulation during normal playback. In order to support bit-accuracy with trick mode play (e.g. fast forward, reverse playback, jump to chapters, and so forth) an addendum to this first prior art approach (the addendum hereinafter referred to as the second prior art approach) was developed. In the second prior art approach to film grain simulation, bit-accuracy was achieved by transmitting the film grain SEI messages only preceding I frames and forcing the transmitted film grain SEI messages to be applied in decoding order. The second prior art approach ensures consistent film grain simulation for all the frames in normal playback as well as in trick mode play, with a minimum overhead in the video bit-stream due to the transmission of the film grain SEI messages. However, since the H.264 standard specifies that SEI messages are to be applied in display order (versus decoding order as specified in the second prior art approach), the solution proposed in the second prior art approach is not compliant with the H.264 standard. While this fact does not affect the perceived visual quality, it may prevent the deployment of the<br><br>
specifications disclosed in the second prior art approach in those forums where conformance to the H.264 standard is required.<br>
Turning to FIG. 1, a film grain simulation in normal playback is indicated generally by the reference numeral 100. In particular, FIG. 1 shows the differences between film grain simulation in decode order 110 according to the second prior art approach and film grain simulation in display order 120 according to the H.264 standard. In this example, film grain SEI messages are sent preceding each I picture. Bold typeface denotes a picture where a film grain SEI has been inserted. In FIG. 1, decode order, the film grain SEI message sent with picture 12 is used in all following pictures until picture B10 is reached (inclusive). Horizontal lines above (decode order) or below (display order) pictures denote the film grain parameters (FG n) used with the pictures; for example, in FIG. 1, display order, film grain parameters FG 1 are used from the first 12 picture until the second B1 picture (inclusive). If SEI messages are assumed to apply to all frames following an I picture in decoding order, as specified in the second prior art approach, the film grain SEI message sent in 12 will apply to frames BO and B1. However, if SEI messages are assumed to apply to all frames following an I picture in display order, as specified in the H.264 standard, frames BO and B1 will be affected by the film grain SEI message of the previous I picture.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have a method for inserting film grain SEI messages in a video system in bit-accurate manner and in compliance with the H.264 standard.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art are addressed by the present invention, which is directed to film grain characteristics Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system.<br>

A description will now be given with respect to FIG. 3 regarding a first illustrative embodiment in accordance with the principles of the present invention relating to film grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system. The method of FIG. 3 extends the specifications described above with respect to the first and second prior art approaches relating to SEI message insertion, with additional specifications that provide both bit-accuracy and compliance with the H.264 standard.<br>
Turning to FIG. 3, a method for film grain SEI message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system is Indicated generally by the reference numeral 300. The method includes a start block 302 that passes control to a function block 305. The<br><br>
function block 305 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall be sent preceding I pictures, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular I picture, and passes control to B function block 310. The function block 310 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall also be sent between two consecutive I pictures, in decoding order, preceding the P or B picture with the smallest POC value, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular P or B picture, and passes control to a function block 315. The function block 315 specifies that the film grain SEI message preceding a P or B picture shall be the same as the film grain SEI message of the closest I picture that precedes the P or B picture, in decoding order, and passes control to an end block 320.<br>
According to the specifications shown and described with respect to FIG. 3, film grain simulation can be performed with bit-accuracy in both display order and decode order. Furthermore, bit-accuracy is also achieved between normal playback and trick mode play.<br>
Turning to FIG. 4, an example of film grain simulation in normal playback in accordance with the method 300 of FIG. 3 is indicated generally by the reference numeral 400. In particular, FIG. 4 shows the differences between film grain simulation in normal playback in decode order 410 and in display order 420, both in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In accordance with the method 300 of FIG. 3, a film grain SEI is inserted preceding the 12 picture (first in decode order) and preceding the BO picture (first in display order). It is to be noted that BO and B1 have the same film grain characteristics regardless of the film grain simulation order.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the method 300 of FIG. 3 ensures bit-accuracy between film grain simulation in decoding order and display order, providing an implementation choice to hardware/software designers. The results obtained by the method 300 of FIG. 3 are compliant with the standard H.264. This is done with a minimum overhead in the coded video-stream due to the insertion of film grain SEI messages. It is to be further appreciated that the method 300 of FIG. 3 ensures bit-accuracy between normal play as well as trick mode play.<br>
Turning to FIG. 5, an example of film grain simulation In trick mode play in accordance with the method 300 of FIG. 3 is indicated generally by the reference<br><br>
numeral 500. In particular, FIG. 5 shows the differences between film grain simulation in trick mode play in decode order 510 and in display order 520, both in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Further, the example 500 relates to a jump to BO in trick mode play that is accomplished with bit-accuracy given that a film grain SEI message has been inserted preceding the BO picture.<br>
A description will now be given with respect to FIG. 7 regarding a second illustrative embodiment in accordance with the principles of the present invention relating to film grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system.<br>
Turning to FIG. 7, a method for film grain SEI message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system is indicated generally by the reference numeral 700. The method 700 of FIG. 7 is derived from the method 300 of FIG. 3 by forcing the insertion of the same film grain SEI in all P pictures and in all B pictures following and I or P picture between two consecutives I pictures.<br>
The method 700 includes a start block 702 that passes control to a function block 705. The function block 705 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall be sent preceding I pictures, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular I picture, and passes control to a function block 710. The function block 710 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall also be sent between two consecutive I pictures, in decoding order, preceding all P pictures or all B pictures following an I or P picture, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular P or B picture, and passes control to a function block 715. The function block 715 specifies that the film grain SEI message preceding a P or B picture shall be the same as the film grain SEI message of the closest I picture preceding the P or B picture, in decoding order, and passes control to an end block 720.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the method 700 of FIG. 7 increases the overhead due to the presence of the film grain SEI messages in the bit-stream. However, It facilitates the access to the SEI message in display order for trick mode play, as in the example 600 illustrated in FIG. 6. Turning to FIG. 6, an example of film grain simulation in 2X fast forward trick mode play in accordance with the method 700 of FIG. 7 is indicated generally by the reference numeral 600. In particular, FIG. 6 shows the differences<br><br>
between film grain simulation in 2X fast forward trick mode play in decode order 610 and in display order 620, both in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In the example 600 of FIG. 6, the decoder will not decode the film grain SEI message in BO. However, it is correct to assume that the film grain SEI message sent preceding the 12 picture applies to B1 since in the second prior art approach forces the SEI messages in 12 and BO to be identical.<br>
A description will now be given with respect to FIG. 8 regarding a third illustrative embodiment in accordance with the principles of the present invention relating to film grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system. In order to allow film grain variations between two consecutive I pictures, the method of FIG. 8 enlarges the set of specifications of the method 300 of FIG. 3 as follows.<br>
Turning to FIG. 8, a method for film grain SEI message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system is indicated generally by the reference numeral 800. It is to be appreciated that the method 800 of FIG. 8 includes the function blocks of the method 300 of FIG. 3.<br>
The method includes a start block 802 that passes control to a function block 305. The function block 305 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall be sent preceding I pictures, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular I picture, and passes control to a function block 310. The function block 310 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall also be sent between two consecutive I pictures, in decoding order, preceding the P or B picture with the smallest POC value, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular P or B picture, and passes control to a function block 315. The function block 315 specifies that the film grain SEI message preceding a P or B picture shall be the same as the film grain SEI message of the closest I picture that precedes the P or B picture, in decoding order, and passes control to a function block 820. The function block 820 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall be sent preceding P pictures, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular P picture, and passes control to a function block 825.<br><br>
The function block 825 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall also be sent between two consecutive P pictures, in decoding order, preceding the B picture with the smallest POC value, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular B picture, and passes control to an end block 830.<br>
According to the specifications of the method 800 of FIG. 8, film grain simulation can be performed with bit-accuracy in both display order and decode order. Furthermore, bit-accuracy is also achieved between normal playback and trick mode play.<br>
A description will now be given with respect to FIG. 10 regarding a fourth illustrative embodiment in accordance with the principles of the present invention relating to film grain Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system.<br>
Turning to FIG. 10, a method for film grain SEI message insertion for bit-accurate simulation in a video system is indicated generally by the reference numeral 1000. The method 1000 of FIG. 10 is derived from the method 800 of FIG. 8 by forcing the insertion a film grain SEI in all B pictures.<br>
The method 1000 includes a start block 1002 that passes control to a function block 1005. The function block 1005 specifies that film grain SEI messages shall be sent preceding I, P and B pictures, further specifies that only one film grain SEI message shall precede a particular picture, and passes control to a function block 1010.<br>
The function block 1010 specifies that the film grain SEI message preceding a B picture shall be the same as the film grain SEI message of its preceding I or P picture, in decoding order, and passes control to an end block 1016.<br>
Turning to FIG. 9, an example of normal playback in accordance with the method 1000 of FIG. 10 is indicated generally by the reference numeral 900. In particular, FIG. 9 shows the differences between film grain simulation in normal playback in decode order 910 and in display order 920, both in accordance with the principles of the present invention.<br>
