				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fermented silkworm pupae silage useful as an ingredient in the animal feeds.<br>
Sericulture and silk production are wed established and are growing industries in India with a high employment potential. Silkworm pupae is a major byproduct (about 40.000MT/ annum on dry wt. basis) generated from these industries. Being rural based industries, the difficulties in collection and transport have resulted in rejection of large quantities of silkworm pupae into the manure pit. In some places, silkworm pupae is sun -dried in the open yard, powdered, oil extracted wherever possible and used mainly in chicken feeds. The CFTRI, Mysore carried out studies on drying of silkworm pupae, extraction of oil and utilisation of silkworm pupae in poultry feed (Panda et ml1968, A CFTRI Report Nr. ES -19/140, 1966 - 68). Discarding silkworm pupae as well as drying of silkworm pupae results into foul smell due to degradation of nutrients. This results into environmental pollution. There is a need for developing a process to prevent these degradative changes and preserve/upgrade the nutrients in silkworm pupae with a dual objective of improving the nutritive value of silkworm pupae and minimising the environmental pollution problem.<br>
Ensiling the silkworm pupae with suitable carbohydrate substrate and additives through fermentation could be a cheaper process to preserve / upgrade the nutrients and minimise the environmental pollution problem.<br>
Reference may be made to Twiddy #f ml 1967 (Int J Food Sci Techno! 22, 115-121), Giurca and Levin 1992 (J Food Biochem 16, 83 - 97), and Zuberi et ml 1993 (Trop Sci 33, 171 - 182)  for fermentation ensiling of fish / fish waste and Russel of ml 1992<br><br><br>
(Poultry Sci 71, 765 - 770), and Uriings et a/1993 (J Anim Sci 71, 2420 - 2426) for poultry processing waste who successfully produced microbiologicalry safe silage product for use in animal feeds.<br>
Seventy issued patents relevant to silages are available in literature including (to mention a few) a process for preparing liquified fish silage prepared using organic/mineral acids, salts and enzymes (Fish silage, US patent nr. 4288458 - 1981), bacterial (Propionibacterium jensenii) treatment to preserve fermented silages from agricultural products ( Bacterial treatment to preserve silage, US patent nr. 4981705-1991), use of sulfites/bisulfites as additive to provide anaerobic atmosphere in fermented silages from grains (Method for preserving silage and related compositions, US patent nr. 4508737-1985), use of methyloluria and methylenediurea to produce silage from fodder for use as a ruminant feed (Method of producing silage, US patent nr. 4483877-1984) and admixing Lactobacillus ptantarum 2B bacteria to produce fermented silage from forages (Silage production from fermentable forages, US patent nr. 4528199-1985).<br>
Besides above mentioned patents, several research papers on preparation and quality evaluation of fermented silages from animal byproducts/offals are available in literature. Our earlier studies have revealed that molasses at 10%(w/w) level was found to be optimum as carbohydrate substrate to effect in situ lactic fermentation in fish viscera (Ahmed and Mahendrakar 1995) and in poultry intestine (Shaw et al 1997, Btoresource Technology, in print). The offal silages had pH of about 4.2 after 48-72 hours fermentation and were free from pathogens, viz., salmonella, conforms (Ecoff), staphylococci and enterococci (Ahmed et al 1996, Journal of Applied Bacteriology 80, 153-156).   Further, inclusion of 0.5%(v/w) propionic acid was effective in suppressing<br><br><br>
yeasts and moulds (Ahmed et al 1996, Journal of Applied Bacteriology 80,153-156) and<br>
0.02%(w/w) ethoxyquin controlled development of rancidity in offal silage lipids<br>
(Mahendrakar et al 1995, dish Journal of Agricultural and Food Research 34, 175-181;<br>
Ahmed and Mahendrakar 1996, Bioresource Technology 58, 247-251). The drawbacks<br>
are these offals harbour large number of microorganisms including pathogens and<br>
spoilage organisms as opposed to possibly very low counts of bacteria associated with<br>
silkworm pupae. This is due to heat treatment of cocoons to facilitate reeling of silk<br>
thread.	Fermentation ensiling of silkworm pupae is based on acid production by<br>
using in situ microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria which, in turn, suppress the growth of spoilage as well as pathogenic bacteria. This process minimises the problem of foul smell resulting from degradative reactions. The silage process is eco-friendly unlike sun-drying of silkworm pupae. However , no information is available in literature on the process for tile preparation of fermented silkworm pupae silage. Hence this process patent.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to convert silkworm pupae into a value - added product, viz., fermented silkworm pupae silage which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to minimise environmental pollution.<br>
Still another object is to utilise the silkworm pupae silage product in animal feeds.<br>
Yet another object is to improve the economy of silk reeling industry by effective utilisation of byproduct, i.e., silkworm pupae.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of fermented silkworm pupae silage useful as an ingredient in animal feed , containing 21-23% protein , 8-11% fat , 1.5 -2.5 minerals , which comprises homogenizing killed silkworm pupae, obtained after reeling of silk thread, to get a past of said silkworm pupae , adding 8% (w/w) molasses as a carbohydrate substrate , 0.25% (v/w) propionic acid , 0.25% (w/w) sorbic acid as antimycotic agents and 0.01% (w/w) butylated hydroxianisde as an antioxidant to the obtained past, mixing the above ingredients thoroughly and allowing the mixture to ferment under microaerophilic condition at a ambient temperature ( 26 + 2 Â° C ) for a period ranging 48-72 hours , getting desired fermented silkworm pupae silage .<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the silkworm pupae contains very low amount of sugars and hence needs addition of carbohydrate substrate to effect fermentation. Silkworm pupae obtained soon after reeling is chopped in Bowl chopper for 2 - 3 min to almost pasty consistency. Optimised quantities of molasses (10% w/w) as a carbohydrate substrate, propionic acid (0.5% v/w) and sorbic acid (0.3% w/w) as antimycotic agents and butylated hydroxyanisole (0.02% w/w) as an antioxidant are added to silkworm pupae white chopping. The mixture was transferred to plastic containers and allowed to ferment under microaerophilic condition at ambient temperature (26 Â± 2Â°C) for 72 hours as shown in the flow chart.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1 Fresh silkworm pupae obtained in a lot of 10 kg soon after reeling was brought to the laboratory and homogenised for 2 minutes in Bowl Chopper. While mixing, 1kg of molasses (Grade 2, IS: 1162 - 1958) as a carbohydrate substrate, 50 ml propionic acid and 30 g sorbic acid as antimycotic agents and 2 g butylated hydroxyanisole as an antioxidant were added to the homogenate. The mixture was transferred in lots of 2 kg in 3L beaker. The sample was layered with a circular film of low density polyethylene and the beaker was covered with petridish. The mixture was allowed to ferment at the temperature of 26Â°C. This sample of fermentation mixture was drawn at a regular interval of 24 hours and analysed for pH, titrable acidity, concentrations of lactic acid and reducing sugars as weN as microbial profiles including mesophilic aerobes (standard plate counts), lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and moulds, spores, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, enterococci and salmonella.<br>
Table 1 lists the chemical composition and microbial profile of silkworm pupae and its fermented silage product. When silkworm pupae was mixed with the optimised quantities of molasses (10% w/w), propionic acid (0.5% v/w), sorbic acid (0.3% w/w) and butylated hydroxyanisole (0.02% w/w), the pH of the mixture was 5.3 and the titrable acidity 1.9 mg NaOH/g. The mixture contained 0.1 % (w/w) lactic acid and 2.7% (w/w) reducing sugar. During fermentation under microaerophilic condition at ambient temperature (26 Â± 2Â° C), the pH declined gradually to 4.2 in 72 hours. The fall in pH was associated with an increase in lactic acid content to 1.7%,<br><br><br>
titrable acidity to 8.6% and decrease in reducing sugar content to 0.7%. The reduction in pH during fermentation resulted in gradual increase in lactic acid bacteria numbers to 6.1 log cfu/g whereas the counts of other bacteria decreased. The inclusion of 0.5% (v/w) propionic acid and 0.3% (w/w) sorbic acid was effective in controlling the growth of yeasts and moulds and 0.02% (w/w) butylated hydroxyanisole controlled the oxidative rancidity in the silage lipids during fermentation. After 72 hours of fermentation, all the pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were absent in the silage product. Table 1.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 2 The silkworm pupae was mixed with ingredients and allowed to ferment at the temperature of 28Â°C as detailed in Example 1.   The chemical composition and microbial profile of silkworm pupae and its fermented silage are listed in Table 2.<br>
The silkworm pupae when mixed with optimised quantities of ingredients as in Example 1, the mixture had pH 5.1, titrable acidity 1.9 mg NaOH/g, lactic acid 0.08 %, reducing sugar 3.4 %. Decrease in pH to 4.1 observed in 72 hours was associated with an increase in lactic acid content to 1.7%, titrable acidity to 7.4% and decrease in reducing sugar content to 0.61%. These changes resulted in to the increase in lactic acid bacteria numbers to 6.6 log cfu/g whereas the counts of other bacteria decreased. As in Example 1, the propionic and sorbic acids suppressed the growth of yeasts and moulds and butylated hydroxyanisole controlled the rancidity development in silage lipids during fermentation. After 72 hours of fermentation, the silage product was free from pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3 The multjvoltine silkworm pupae was mixed with ingredients and allowed to ferment at the temperature of 30Â°C as detailed in Example 1. Table 3 lists the chemical composition and microbial profile of silkworm pupae and its fermented<br>
silage product. The silkworm pupae when mixed with optimised quantities of ingredients as mentioned in Example 1, the mixture had pH 5.2, titrable acidity 1.6 mg NaOH/g, lactic acid 0.05 % and reducing sugar 3.3 %. Fall in pH to 4.2 in 72 hours of fermentation was associated with an increase in lactic acid content to 2.1 %, titrable acidity to 7.1 mg NaOH/g and decrease in reducing sugar content to 0.64%. This reduction in pH resulted in to an increase in lactic acid bacteria numbers to 6.5 log cfu/g whereas the counts of other bacte/ia decreased. As in Examples 1 and 2, the growth of yeasts and moulds was suppressed by propionic and sorbic acids and rancidity development in silage lipids was controlled by butylated hydroxyanisole. After 72 hours of fermentation, the silage was free from all the pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.<br>
