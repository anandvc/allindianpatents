Method for manufacture of sanitised organic sludge<br>
The present invention relates to a method for sanitation of organic<br>
sludge.<br>
Depositing organic sludge, in particular dewatered sludge, from<br>
public sewage treatment plants constitutes a large environmental problem,<br>
particularly with regard to odours, danger of infection, drainage, etc. To be able<br>
to make use of such sludge, it must be sanitised so that the treated sludge can,<br>
for example, be used as a fertiliser or a soil improvement agent. Sanitation<br>
takes place in that the temperature of the mass is brought up to about 60 °C,<br>
something that reduces the bacterial activity in the sludge, and thus the danger<br>
of infection, to an acceptable level.<br>
One problem that arises in the sanitation in particular of sludge<br>
from sewage treatment plants, is that the consistency of the sludge makes it<br>
difficult to achieve sufficiently good sanitation with the help of composting.<br>
Normally, the sludge consists of very fine particulate matter, something that<br>
leads to the aerobic bacteria that carry out the degradation process itself not<br>
being supplied sufficient oxygen for the process to run satisfactorily. In addition<br>
to the sludge consisting of very fine particles, further formation of moisture will<br>
also take place, something that leads to the supply of oxygen being further<br>
reduced. This could result in problems with smells and drainage of fluid.<br>
A series of methods and equipment for treatment of such sludge is<br>
known. The previously most used method is composting of the sludge. This is a<br>
very time consuming process that leads to problems with regard to smell,<br>
drainage and which in addition results in a matter that is difficult to handle.<br>
Another known method is adding lime to the mass, something that<br>
leads to a chemical reaction with an associated increase in the mass<br>
temperature. A disadvantage with this method is that relatively large amounts of<br>
lime are required, something that can lead to odour problems (formation of<br><br>
ammonia), and which also can kill some of the bacteria that are appropriate if<br>
the treated sludge is to be used as a fertilizer or a soil improvement agent.<br>
Yet another known method is heat treatment and/or drying of the<br>
sludge by supplying heat from an external heat source. This is an energy<br>
demanding and costly process.<br>
From the patent literature several different solutions to treat sludge<br>
containing organic matter are known.<br>
From DD 14265 a method to treat drilling muds is known where fly<br>
ash, a coagulation agent, for example lime, and a flocculating agent, for<br>
example polyacrylamide are added. In addition, a binding agent, for example<br>
consisting of cement and potassium silicate, is added.<br>
From DE 199 22 872, a method for manufacture of artificial soil is<br>
known. The product consists of sludge, paper, lime, waste materials from fruit<br>
and vegetables, nitrate and charcoal. The publication does not describe addition<br>
of a super absorbent to the sludge.<br>
From WO 97/10190 a method is known for treatment of organic<br>
waste, for example, sewage water. Firstly, shredded paper or cardboard are<br>
added to the waste. Thereafter, earthworms are allowed to digest the mixture of<br>
waste and paper. An alkali, for example lime, is then added to raise the pH of<br>
the mixture. This publication does not mentioned addition of a super absorbent<br>
to the sludge either.<br>
From US 4,659,472 a method for manufacture of a mixture of<br>
sludge that can be composted from a sewage treatment plant is known. Wet<br>
sludge with a dry matter content of about 3 % by weight is fed to a mixing tank<br>
and sawdust is added during stirring with the help of air. After the mixing tank,<br>
this suspension is pumped further with a polyelectrolyte solution being added<br>
before it is fed to a filter for removal of water, and the resulting mixture has a dry<br><br>
solids content of about 30 % by weight. This dewatered mixture is then<br>
subjected to a composting process. The most important differences between<br>
the methods according to this publication and the invention are that treatment of<br>
a wet (liquid) sludge with a dry matter content of about 3 % by weight is<br>
described, but the invention has as an aim to treat already dewatered sludge<br>
from a sewage treatment plant with a dry matter content of 20-25 % by weight<br>
(claim 4). This difference in dry matter content leads to the further treatment of<br>
the sludge being very different. According to the invention, the cellulose fibres<br>
are firstly mixed with the super absorbent. The aim of this is, according to the<br>
invention, to get a better distribution of the super absorbent in the resulting<br>
mixture than if the super absorbent is added directly to the sludge or after the<br>
sludge and cellulose fibres have been mixed. US 4,659,472 further describes<br>
that the sludge mixture is pressed to a dry matter content of about 30 % by<br>
weight, this means that the mass that comes out from the process in US<br>
4,659,472 has only fractionally higher dry matter content than the mass that is<br>
fed into the process according to the invention. As the dry matter content of the<br>
wet sludge that is supplied to the process according to US 4,659,472 has only a<br>
dry matter content of 3 % by weight, against 20-25 % by weight according to the<br>
invention, this means that at corresponding volumes of the process tanks, the<br>
method according to the invention is capable of treating 7-8 times more sludge<br>
volumes than the method according to US 4,659,472.<br>
From JP 60197299 a method is known for manufacture of a<br>
combustible dehydration promoting agent, where an organic fibrous substance<br>
and a cationic, high molecular substance are mixed and pressed under high<br>
pressure to a density of 0.3 g/cm3 or more. This dehydration-promoting agent is<br>
thereafter added to a sludge, which is finally pressed. This publication does not<br>
describe a method for production of a sludge mixture from a sewage treatment<br>
plant that can be composted, and the abstract indicates that the sludge mixture<br>
is to be burnt. The aim of adding dehydration promoting means produced by the<br>
fibrous organic substance and the cationic substance is to be able to remove<br>
water from the mixture in a later processing step. This publication does not<br><br>
describe a method for the manufacture of a mixture of a fibre containing<br>
substance, a super absorbent and dewatered organic sludge, according to the<br>
present invention, that can be composted either.<br>
From JP 59078098 a method is known to remove the water content<br>
of a dehydrated sludge cake by adding a mixture of a fibrous substance and a<br>
cationic coagulant and thereafter vacuuming dry this mixture. This publication<br>
does not describe a method for manufacture of a mixture of organic sludge, a<br>
fibrous substance and a super absorbent that can be composted either, as<br>
described in the present application.<br>
From US 4,559,143 a method is known for sludge treatment where<br>
fibre, for example, organic fibres, and a coagulant are added to the sludge. The<br>
aim of the addition of these materials is to increase the formation of so-called<br>
flocs to improve the filtration characteristics of the sludge, thereby making it<br>
easier to obtain dewatered sludge. This method is directed toward treatment of<br>
non-dewatered sludge to make it easier to remove the water content. The<br>
sludge according to the present invention has already been dewatered and the<br>
aim of the method according to the invention is thus another. This is further<br>
supported by the examples in US 4,559,143 where a non-dewatered sludge<br>
with a dry matter content of 3.5 % by weight is used in example 1.<br>
From CH 627 718 a method is known for sanitation of sludge with a<br>
dry matter content of at least 4 % by weight. The sludge is fed to an air<br>
container and oxygen containing gas or pure oxygen is added during agitation.<br>
The sludge is thereafter fed to a degradation container where methane gas is<br>
formed. This publication is not considered relevant for the present application<br>
either, as dewatered sludge is not used, there is no addition of fibres and no<br>
absorbent either.<br>
The present invention has as an aim to provide a method for<br>
treatment of organic sludge, which is not encumbered with the disadvantages of<br><br>
the known methods described above, and where the treated sludge can be<br>
used as a fertiliser or a soil improvement agent without any further treatment.<br>
A further aim is to provide a method that does not require supply of<br>
energy to achieve sufficient sanitation of the sludge, at the same time as<br>
problems with drainage and odours are avoided.<br>
These and other aims are obtained with a method for manufacture<br>
of sanitised organic sludge which is characterised in that the method<br>
incorporates the following steps.<br>
mechanical mixing of a part containing cellulose fibres with a super<br>
absorbent and dewatered organic sludge, said dewatered organic<br>
sludge having a dry matter content of 20-25 % by weight, and the<br>
amount of cellulose fibres in relation to dewatered organic sludge is<br>
5-10% by weight.<br>
feeding the sludge mixture containing super absorbent and<br>
cellulose fibres to a sanitation container<br>
continuously feed air to the sludge mixture until the desired<br>
temperature has been reached.<br>
The cellulose fibre containing part is preferably mixed with the<br>
super absorbent before addition of dewatered organic sludge.<br>
The cellulose fibre containing component is preferably shredded<br>
newspaper and the super absorbent is a biologically degradable<br>
polyacrylamide.<br>
The organic sludge is/can be hydrocarbon polluted soil and/or<br>
waste from fish processing/abattoirs.<br>
The method according to the invention will be described in more<br>
detail in the following with the help of an embodiment example.<br><br>
According to the method according to the invention, organic sludge, preferably<br>
dewatered organic sludge from a sewage treatment plant, is mixed with<br>
cellulose fibres and a super absorbent. The super absorbent is, for example,<br>
polyacrylamide or another biological degradable super absorbent. A person<br>
skilled in the arts will easily be able to find an appropriate super absorbent from<br>
the relevant criteria. The cellulose fibres are preferably shredded strips of<br>
newspaper or the like. The amount of super absorbent in relation to newspaper<br>
is of the order 2 % by weight. The amount of newspaper in relation to<br>
dewatered organic sludge is of the order 5-10 % by weight. After mixing of the<br>
ingredients, the resulting sludge mixture is subjected to composting with air<br>
added until the resulting sanitation temperature has been reached. The required<br>
sanitation temperature is around 58-60 °C. This composting takes place without<br>
any supply of external energy.<br>
With regard to an especially preferred embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, the cellulose fibres are first mechanically mixed with<br>
the super absorbent. The dewatered organic sludge, having a dry matter<br>
content of around 20-25 % by weight, is thereafter mechanically mixed into the<br>
mixture of cellulose fibres and super absorbent. The aim of first mixing the<br>
cellulose fibres and the super absorbent before the organic sludge is added to<br>
the mixture is that one achieves a better distribution of the super absorbent in<br>
the final mixture.<br>
After sludge, cellulose fibres and super absorbent have been<br>
mixed, a porous mixture has been produced which can be composted, for<br>
example, in a container with a supply of air, such that the desired sanitation<br>
temperature is reached. As soon as the mass is sanitised, it can be applied as a<br>
fertilizer or a soil improvement agent. Tests have shown that by using the<br>
method according to the invention, the sanitation time can be reduced from<br>
around 3 years for organic sludge with no addition of cellulose fibres and heat to<br>
about 3 days.<br><br>
The method according to the invention is particularly suited to treatment of<br>
dewatered sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants, but it is also implied<br>
that the method can be used in the treatment of other organic sludge, for<br>
example soil contaminated with hydrocarbon containing compounds, typically<br>
oil, wastes from abattoirs/fish processing and the like.<br><br>
