METHOD FOR PRODUCING UNSATURATED UNSATURATED FATTY ACID<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing unsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes by<br>
means of fixed-bed catalytic partial oxidation in a shell-<br>
and-tube heat exchange type reactor, as well as to a fixed-<br>
bed shell-and-tube heat exchange type reactor used in the<br>
above method.<br>
Background Art<br>
A process for producing unsaturated aldehydes and then<br>
unsaturated acids from olefins is a typical example of<br>
catalytic vapor phase oxidation.<br>
To perform the partial oxidation of olefins, a<br>
multimetal oxide containing molybdenum and bismuth or<br>
vanadium or a mixture thereof is used as a catalyst.<br>
Typically, the partial oxidation of olefins may be<br>
exemplified by a process for producing (meth)acrolein and<br>
then (meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing propylene or<br>
isobutylene, a process for producing phthalic anhydride by<br>
oxidizing naphthalene or ortho-xylene or a process for<br>
producing maleic anhydride by partially oxidizing benzene,<br>
butylene or butadiene.<br>
Generally, propylene or isobutylene is subjected to<br>
two-step catalytic vapor phase partial oxidation to form<br>
(meth)acrylic acid as a final product. More particularly, in<br>
the first step, propylene or isobutylene is oxidized by<br>
oxygen, diluted inert gas, water vapor and an optional<br>
amount of catalyst to form (meth)acrolein as a main product.<br>
In the second step, (meth)acrolein obtained from the<br>
preceding step is oxidized by oxygen, diluted inert gas,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
water vapor and an optional amount of catalyst to form<br>
(meth)acrylic acid. The catalyst used in the first step is a<br>
catalyst comprising an oxide and/or a composite oxide based<br>
on Mo-Bi, which oxidizes propylene or isobutylene to form<br>
(meth) acrolein as a main product. Additionally, a part of<br>
(meth)acrolein is further oxidized on the same catalyst to<br>
form (meth) acrylic acid partially. The catalyst used in the<br>
second step is a catalyst comprising an oxide and/or a<br>
composite oxide based on Mo-V, which oxidizes<br>
(meth) acrolein-containing mixed gas produced in the first<br>
step, particularly (meth)acrolein, to form (meth)acrylic<br>
acid as a main product.<br>
Reactors for carrying out the above process are<br>
realized in such a manner that each of the above two steps<br>
are implemented in one system or in two different systems<br>
(see US Patent No. 4,256,783).<br>
Generally, (meth)acrylic acid is reacted with alcohol,<br>
to form (meth) acrylate, which is used for paints, fiber<br>
formula, coating agent of paper. Especially, a high purity<br>
of acrylic acid is -used as a raw material for a highly<br>
hygroscopic resin, and a demand thereof is recently<br>
increasing rapidly.<br>
In general, catalytic vapor phase oxidation is<br>
implemented as follows. At least one catalyst in the form of<br>
granules is packed into reaction tubes, feed gas is supplied<br>
to a reactor through the reaction tubes and the feed gas is<br>
in contact with the catalyst in the reaction tubes to<br>
perform vapor phase oxidation. Reaction heat generated<br>
during the reaction is removed by heat transfer with a heat<br>
transfer medium, wherein the temperature of the heat<br>
transfer medium is maintained at a predetermined temperature.<br>
Particularly, the heat transfer medium for heat exchange is<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
provided on the outer surface of the catalytic tubes to<br>
perform heat transfer. A reaction product mixture containing<br>
a desired product is collected via a duct and then sent to a<br>
purification step. Generally, catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation is a highly exothermic reaction. Therefore, it is<br>
very important to control the reaction temperature in a<br>
specific range and to downsize hot spots in the reaction<br>
zone.<br>
Vapor phase partial oxidation for producing<br>
unsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes is an<br>
exothermic reaction. Therefore, it has a problem in that a<br>
hot spot (a point whose temperature is abnormally high) is<br>
generated in the reactor. Such hot spots show a relatively<br>
high temperature compared to other parts of the reactor.<br>
Accordingly, in hot spots, complete oxidation proceeds<br>
rather than partial oxidation, thereby increasing by-<br>
products such as COx and decreasing the yield of unsaturated<br>
acids. Additionally, excessive heat generated in a hot spot<br>
causes migration or sublimation of molybdenum that is a main,<br>
element of the catalyst, resulting in deposition of<br>
molybdenum in a catalytic layer and pressure drop in the<br>
catalytic layer, degradation of catalytic activity and in<br>
shortening of the lifetime of the catalyst. Therefore, yield<br>
of unsaturated acid decreases.<br>
Generally, various methods are known in order to<br>
control the excessive heat at a hot spot in a catalytic<br>
reaction accompanied with heat generation. Such methods<br>
include a method for reducing the amount of feed gas to<br>
decrease the space velocity and a method of using a reaction<br>
tube having a relatively small inner diameter. However, when<br>
the space velocity decreases, it is not possible to obtain<br>
high productivity in an industrial scale. When the inner<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
diameter of a reaction tube decreases, it is difficult to<br>
manufacture the reactor. Moreover, in the latter case, there<br>
are disadvantages of economically unfavorable high cost<br>
needed for manufacturing the reactor, and increased time and<br>
labor needed for packing a catalyst. For these reasons,<br>
there has been a continuous need for and research into a<br>
method for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids with high yield and high<br>
productivity by using a catalyst stably for a long time,<br>
while avoiding the above problems according to the known<br>
methods.<br>
For example, Such methods include a method for packing<br>
a catalytic bed by controlling the volume of catalyst in<br>
such a manner that the volume gradually decreases from the<br>
inlet to the cutlet(Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Hei9-<br>
241209); a method for packing a catalytic bed by controlling<br>
the volume of catalyst particle in such a manner that the<br>
volume gradually decreases from the inlet to the outlet; a<br>
method for preparing acrylic acid by multistage-packing with<br>
catalysts having different activities; a method of dividing<br>
inside of a reaction tube into a plurality of reaction zones<br>
and packing each catalyst therein; a method for packing a<br>
catalytic bed by controlling the activity of catalyst in<br>
such a manner that the activity gradually increases from the<br>
inlet to the outlet(Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 2000-<br>
336060); a method for packing a catalytic bed by controlling<br>
the amount of catalyst supported on carrier in such a manner<br>
that the activity gradually increases from the inlet to the<br>
outlet(US No. 2000-336060); a method for packing a catalytic<br>
bed wherein a first reaction zone most adjacent to the inlet<br>
is packed with the catalyst having higher activity than that<br>
of the second reaction zone adjacent thereto and then the<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
catalytic bed from second reaction zone is packed by<br>
controlling the activity of catalyst in such a manner that<br>
the activity gradually increases from the inlet to the<br>
outlet(Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 2001-112617). However,<br>
the above mentioned methods for minimizing degradation of<br>
catalyst and suppressing side reactions by decreasing the<br>
temperatures of hot spots are not fully effective to solve<br>
the above described problems.<br>
Therefore, there is a continuous need for a method for<br>
minimizing degradation of catalyst and side reactions caused<br>
by extreme heat generation at a hot spot generated during<br>
the catalytic reaction.<br>

reactor according to Comparative Example 2 and Example 2,<br>

Disclosures of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to minimize<br>
sublimation and/or migration of molybdenum that is a main<br>
element of the catalyst, pressure-drop in catalytic layer<br>
and degradation of catalytic activity, all of which occur at<br>
a hot spot, and to increase the lifetime of catalyst. In<br>
order to achieve the object, the present invention provides<br>
a method for producing unsaturated fatty acids with high<br>
yield in a stable manner for a long time, the method<br>
including estimating the position of a hot spot in a<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
reaction tube and packing an inactive material layer into<br>
the hot spot to reduce heat generation at the hot spot,<br>
thereby facilitating heat control and/or to disperse a<br>
temperature distribution toward a reaction gas outlet.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided a method for producing unsaturated fatty acids<br>
(ex.  (meth)acrylic acid)  from unsaturated aldehydes  (ex.<br>
(meth)acrolein)  by means of fixed-bed catalytic partial<br>
oxidation in a shell-and-tube reactor, characterized in that<br>
the  reactor includes  a  reaction  zone  for  producing<br>
unsaturated acids, the reaction zone having an inactive<br>
material layer inserted into a position where a hot spot is<br>
to be generated in a reaction tube.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a shell-and-tube reactor that may be used<br>
in a method for producing unsaturated fatty acids from<br>
unsaturated acids by means of fixed-bed catalytic partial<br>
oxidation, characterized in that the reactor includes a<br>
reaction zone for producing unsaturated acids, the reaction<br>
zone having an inactive material layer inserted into, a<br>
position where a hot spot is to be generated in a reaction<br>
tube.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail.<br>
According to the present invention, an inactive<br>
material layer is formed at the position of a hot spot in<br>
the reactor so that partial oxidation at the hot spot can be<br>
prevented, thereby minimizing heat generation at the hot<br>
spot and dispersing the temperature distribution, resulting<br>
in minimization of degradation of catalyst and side<br>
reactions.<br>
As used herein, the term "hot spot" is referred to as<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
a point where a peak temperature is generated. For example,<br>
a hot spot may be a point where an abnormally high<br>
temperature is maintained due to excessive heat generation<br>
or heat accumulation, in a catalytic bed in the reaction<br>
tube of the reaction zone for producing unsaturated acids<br>
from unsaturated aldehydes.<br>
A hot spot is formed by the reaction heat generated<br>
during catalytic vapor phase oxidation. The position and<br>
size of a hot spot are determined by many factors including<br>
a reactant composition, space velocity and temperature of<br>
heat transfer medium. Under constant processing conditions,<br>
a hot spot has a constant position and size. Therefore, the<br>
position of a hot spot can be estimated by using a<br>
simulation method, etc.<br>
In general, each catalytic layer has at least one hot<br>
spot. The hot spot may be generated at the front part of the<br>
catalytic bed for the oxidation, enriched with a main<br>
reactant (unsaturated aldehydes) and molecular oxygen. In<br>
addition, the hot spot may be generated at the vicinity of<br>
the border of adjacent catalytic layers having different<br>
activities, in the case of a reactor structure packed with<br>
two or more catalytic layers.<br>
According to the present invention, the position of a<br>
hot spot and the temperature peak size of a hot spot are<br>
quantitatively analyzed based on the temperature profile<br>
(see FIG. 2) of a catalytic bed in a reaction tube. Then, a<br>
predetermined height of an inactive material layer is<br>
inserted into the temperature peak position where a hot spot<br>
is generated so as to prevent partial oxidation at the hot<br>
spot, thereby minimizing heat generation at the hot spot and<br>
dispersing a temperature distribution.<br>
The reactors that may be used in the present invention<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
include a fixed-bed multi-tube reactor and a conical fixed-<br>
bed multi-tube reactor. There is no particular limitation on<br>
the shape of the reactor. In order to form a catalytic bed<br>
needed for carrying out vapor phase partial oxidation, a<br>
catalyst is packed in the reaction tube of a reactor, an<br>
inactive material is packed at the position of a hot spot,<br>
in one layer or two or more layers having different kinds<br>
and sizes of inactive material, and then the catalyst is<br>
further packed in the reaction tube.<br>
In the case of the reaction zone for producing<br>
unsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes, a catalytic<br>
bed may be packed in one layer having uniform activity along<br>
the axial direction, or in two or more layers whose<br>
catalytic activity gradually increases along the axial<br>
direction, if necessary.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst used in the vapor phase<br>
partial oxidation for producing unsaturated fatty acids is a<br>
. metal oxide represented by the following formula 1:<br>
[formula 1]<br>
Moa Ab Bc Cd De Of<br>
wherein Mo is molybdenum;<br>
A is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of W and Cr;<br>
B is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of P, Te, As, B, Sb, Ce, Pb, Mn, V, Nb, and Te;<br>
C is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Si, Al, Zr, Rh, Cu, Ni, Ti, Ag and Sn;<br>
D is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Na, K, Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba and MgO;<br>
and<br>
each of a, b, c, d, e and f represents the atomic,<br>
ratio of each element, with the proviso that when a=12, b is<br>
8<br><br>

a number of between 0.01 and 10, c is a number of between<br>
0.01 and 10, d is a number of between 0.01 and 10, e is a<br>
number of between 0.01 and 10, and f is a number defined<br>
depending on the oxidation state of each of the above<br>
elements.<br>
The catalyst may be supported on carrier having a<br>
cylindrical, a hollow cylindrical or spheral shape, and<br>
there is no particular limitation in shape of the carrier.<br>
The catalyst having a cylindrical shape preferably has an<br>
aspect ratio (the ratio of length to diameter {outer<br>
diameter), i.e., L/D) of between 1 and 1.3. More preferably,<br>
the ratio of L/D equals 1. The catalyst having a cylindrical<br>
or spherical shape has an outer diameter of preferably<br>
3~10mm, and more preferably 5~8mm.<br>
The inactive material layer that may be used in the<br>
present invention may be formed of an inactive material<br>
alone or a mixture of an inactive material with a catalyst.<br>
However, when a mixture of an inactive material, with a<br>
catalyst is used, the activity of the mixture should be<br>
lower than that of a catalytic layer in the vicinity of a<br>
hot spot. The volume ratio of the inactive material to the<br>
catalyst in the inactive material layer is preferably 20-<br>
100%, and more preferably 80-100%.<br>
The inactive material that may be used in the present<br>
invention is referred to as; material inactive to a reaction<br>
for producing uinsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes<br>
such as catalytic oxidation of (meth)acrolein. Such inactive<br>
materials include silica, alumina, silica/alumina, zirconium<br>
oxide, titanium oxide, mixtures thereof, etc.<br>
Although there is no particular limitation in shape of<br>
the inactive material, the inactive material may have the<br>
shape of a sphere, cylinder, ring, rod, and mass with a<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/Kr2006/000343<br>
suitable size. If necessary, mixtures of the above shapes<br>
may be used.<br>
When the inactive material has the shape of a sphere,<br>
cylinder and ring, the diameter is preferably 2-10 mm, and<br>
more preferably 5-8 mm. When the inactive material has the<br>
shape of a cylinder and ring, the ratio of length to<br>
diameter (L/D) is preferably 1-1.3, and more preferably is<br>
1. Preferably, the inactive material has the same or similar<br>
shape and/or size as the catalyst.<br>
At the point of a hot spot, the inactive material<br>
layer is packed to the height of 0.1-1000 mm, preferably to<br>
the height of 10-200 mm, in one or more layers, preferably<br>
in one or two layers. The position where the inactive<br>
material layer is disposed in a reaction tube ranges<br>
preferably 1-80% and more preferably 1-60% of the total<br>
length of the whole catalytic bed in the reaction zone<br>
producing unsaturated acid, when viewed from the reaction<br>
gas inlet toward the outlet.<br>
It is preferable that the temperature at the hot spot<br>
of a reactor is controlled by the inactive material layer<br>
inserted into the hot spot, in such a manner . that the<br>
temperature of the hot spot is equal to or lower than<br>
(reaction temperature + 45°C). Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
minimize sublimation of catalytically active components and<br>
to inhibit side reactions caused by excessive heat, thereby<br>
increasing the lifetime of a catalyst and producing<br>
unsaturated fatty acids from unsaturated aldehydes with high<br>
yield.<br>
Vapor phase partial oxidation for producing<br>
unsaturated acids in a reactor having an inactive layer at<br>
the hot spot according to the present invention is suitably<br>
carried  out  at  a  reaction  temperature  of  200-450 °C,<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/083098	PCT/KR2006/000343<br>
preferably 265-370°C, under a reaction pressure of 0.1-10<br>
atm, preferably 0.5-3 atm. For example, in order to perform<br>
oxidation, a feed gas including 5-10 volume% of a feed<br>
compound such as (meth)acrolein, 10-13 volume% of oxygen, 5-<br>
60 volume% of water vapor and 20-80 volume% of an inert gas<br>
is introduced onto a catalyst at a space velocity of 500-<br>
5000 hr"1 (STP) .<br>

that the following examples are illustrative only and the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto.<br>

Experimental Example: Catalytic Activity Test<br>
The reactors packed with catalysts according to the<br>
above Examples and Comparative Examples were used to perform<br>
oxidation of acrolein, thereby producing acrylic acid. The<br>
oxidation was carried out by introducing a feed gas<br>
containing 7 volume% of acrolein, 5.6 volume% of oxygen, 15<br>
volume% of water vapor and 72.4 volume% of inert nitrogen<br>
onto the catalyst at the reaction temperature of 265-300°C,<br>
under the reaction pressure of 1-3 atm, at the space<br>
velocity of 500-2000 hr-1 (STP).<br>
The results obtained from the above Examples and<br>

As can be seen from Table 1, reactors of Examples 1-4<br>
including at least one layer of inactive material formed at<br>
the point of a hot spot in the catalytic reaction zone<br>
according to the present invention can provide excellent<br>
acrolein conversion ratio and yield of a desired product of<br>
acrylic acid as well as a lower temperature in the point of<br>
heat generation.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the present<br>
invention provides a method for producing unsaturated fatty<br>
acids from unsaturated aldehydes such as (meth)acrolein, by<br>
means of fixed-bed catalytic vapor phase partial oxidation<br>
with molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen-containing gas in<br>
a shell-and-tube heat exchange type reactor. According to<br>
the present invention, it is possible to minimize the heat<br>
generation in hot spots, to disperse a temperature<br>
distribution toward an outlet, and thus to produce<br>
unsaturated fatty acids stably with high yield for a long<br>
time, by virtue of at least one layer of inactive material<br>
inserted into a position where a hot spot is to be generated<br>
in a reaction tube.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection<br>
with what is presently considered to be the most practical<br>
and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the<br>
invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the<br>
drawings. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various<br>
