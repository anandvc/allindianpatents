PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
ENGLISH TRANSLATION VARIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/ EP2006/ 006892 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1 and a textile machine for carrying out the method according to the preamble of claim 9.<br>
A method for preparing a subsequent treating or processing operation of a textile bobbin is known from DE OS 37 32 367 wherein a readable and writable electronic memory chip is arranged on the textile bobbin or the tube thereof. The memory chip is used to store specific information for the respective textile bobbin produced on a textile machine, such as the production date, the production time, the production site, the machine number, the batch number, the fibre material, the yarn length and the like. However, information about the number of completed clearer cuts or the number of yarn breaks eliminated which occurred during production of the textile bobbin and which are relevant to the subsequent treating or processing operations, is also recorded.<br>
A method for operating an open-end spinning mechanism is known from DE 197 55 060 Al, in which an identification marking which is configured as a transponder or as a barcode, is arranged on a spinning rotor. The transponder and also the barcode are used as information carriers of product data specific to the spinning rotor, such as the year of construction, type, size or the like. This readable information is used to avoid faulty use of a spinning rotor type when installing the spinning rotor in a workstation of an open-end spinning mechanism. This serves to ensure that the correct spinning rotors in terms of spinning technology are always used for the respective yarn batch. The transponder used is provided with a permanently stored coding which only allows the specification of the spinning rotor.<br>
The method proposed according to DE 197 55 060 Al only provides for the identification of the spinning rotor used against the background of safety and production aspects.<br><br><br>
It is known from DE 10117 095 Al to provide exchangeable machine components of a textile machine with an identification marking. The identification markings are configured as colour markings which are read out by means of an optical recording system. The information read out allows conclusions in the manner already mentioned about the nature and the type of exchangeable component. In this manner, the sensible use of components on the textile machine is to be ensured in terms of spinning technology, as already known from DE 197 55 060 Al. DE 101 17 095 Al also only discloses the possibility of identification of an exchangeable component against the background of safety and production aspects.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of providing a method and a textile machine for carrying out the method, whereby the automatic recording of data influencing the wear of an exchangeable component is made possible.<br>
This object is achieved by the characterising features of claim 1 with regard to the method and by the characterising features of claim 9 with regard to the textile machine.<br>
Further advantageous configurations are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
According to claim 1, it is proposed that during the lifecycle of the exchangeable components, at least the operating data which directly influence the state of wear of the exchangeable components and can be recorded for these during the period of use thereof are stored on the transponder. The operating data to be recorded are, for example, data such as the tonnage processed with the respective components, optionally broken down over a plurality of batches and the number of operating hours during which the components were used. Likewise, the conditions of use under which the exchangeable components were used may be recorded, such as, for example, the rotational speed during the processing of a batch, the average rotational speed over the period of use or the total period of use of the components.<br><br><br>
However, the number of thread breaks or the clearing cuts in relation to the period of use of the components may also be recorded in the respective transponder.<br>
The operating data recorded over the lifespan allow assessment of the degree of wear-dependent behaviour of the exchangeable components under different conditions of use. In this manner, quality profiles can be set up for the respective components and this allows optimisation of the exchangeable components in relation to their conditions of use. This may lead to improved utilisation of the service lives, components of the same type with a similar state of wear being used to process a batch.<br>
For this purpose, when components are exchanged, the quality of the component used for the exchange can rapidly be checked and compared using operating data and consequently a more reliable statement can be made about the usability thereof. Moreover, a categorisation of the components as a function of wear is made possible so the stock keeping becomes more transparent. Possible categories are above all the actual period of use of the components or the throughput achieved.<br>
In addition, on the basis of knowledge of the wear of the stored components, it can be weighed up whether and to what extent the relevant components are used again or what quality can be achieved through the processing of a batch on the basis of the use of the components on a textile machine.<br>
Above all, the operating data of the exchangeable components directly connected with the material to be processed, such as the fibre band or the thread to be produced, are to be recorded. According to the invention, the method is used in various textile machines, such as rotor spinning machines, ring spinning machines, winding machines, twisting machines or the like, in which the exchangeable components, in particular, are provided with transponders, which directly come into contact with the material to be processed and are therefore subject to greater wear than, for example, other exchangeable components of the textile machine.<br><br><br>
A further substantial advantage is produced in that the operating data recorded in the transponder are not deleted when the exchangeable components are removed from the textile machine. The operating data recorded in the transponders are also available for a repeated use of the exchangeable components as the operating data were stored individually in the transponder associated with the respective component and not at a central location of the textile machine. In this manner, the necessary storage requirement at the textile machine is reduced. In addition, the textile machines do not have to be connected to one another in such a way for this that they can exchange operating data with one another to ensure that when using the component on a different textile machine of the same type, the history of the lifecycle of the exchanged component is available. Rather, the operating data of the components recorded in the transponders can be retrieved at any time and can be used to assess the state of wear.<br>
In particular, the operating data relevant to the exchangeable component can be transferred automatically to the transponder for recording in the event of a work interruption. This may be the case, for example, on the initiation of a bobbin change, or a batch change or when there is a thread break or a clearer cut or after the textile machine has been switched on. This achieves gap-free recording of the operating data over the lifecycle of the exchangeable components.<br>
Advantageously, the operating data stored in the transponder may be automatically read out on introduction of the components into the workstations of the textile machine. Thus, the servicing personnel have available the data of the respective components which are installed in the textile machine as a replacement for other components. The data may be displayed for this purpose, for example directly at the respective workstation or at a central control unit.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the operating data stored in the transponders of the exchangeable components may be read out independently of their use in the workstations of the textile machine. This is, in particular, advantageous when storing the exchangeable components as the operating data recorded in the transponders can be retrieved at any time in order to be able to categorise the components according to their state of wear or to already be able to select them prior to their installation in the workstation of the textile machine.<br>
For this purpose, the transponder may be read out and written by means of a transceiver. Furthermore, the operating data stored in the transponder may be encoded. In this manner, undesired reading or over-writing of the operating data stored in the transponders may be prevented.<br>
According to the characterising features of claim 9, it is proposed that a sensor device for writing and reading the transponders attached to the components or integrated into the components should be arranged in the region of each workstation. In this manner, the operating data already recorded on the transponder are read out when the components are introduced into the respective workstation of the textile machine or the operating data are updated in the already installed position of the components after each completed work cycle to continuously document the lifecycle of the components. When the components are put into operation for the first time, these are initialised, in other words, the time of putting into operation is stored on the transponder of the components.<br>
Advantageously, the workstations may in each case have a control device which is<br>
connected to the transceivers.  Furthermore, the textile machine may have a central<br>
unit which is connected to the transceivers. Thus, the operating data are transmitted<br>
by the superordinate central control unit or by the workstations' own control devices<br>
to the transceivers and vice versa.    For this purpose, the transmission of the<br>
operating data may be initiated, for example, by work interruptions, which are<br>
communicated by the respective control device of the workstations or the central<br>
control  unit  to  the   transceivers.     In  addition,   at  regular  time   intervals,  a<br><br><br>
communication of the operating data may be initiated to update the database on the transponders of the exchangeable components used in the textile machine.<br>
The transponder may be both an active and a passive transponder. The use of an active or passive transponder depends inter alia on the service life to be expected of the component and on the required transmission range of the operating data stored on the transponder. Active transponders are equipped with their own energy supply and therefore have a higher range than passive transponders. On the other hand, passive transponders are more economical.<br>
The transceivers are preferably configured in such a way that the operating data of a plurality of components can be read out simultaneously. This is, in particular, advantageous if, for example, an assessment of components in stock is to be carried out as this process can be considerably accelerated thereby.<br>
Further details of the invention can be inferred below from an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	shows a side view of a workstation of an open-end rotor spinning<br>
machine;<br>
Fig. 2	schematically shows the activation of the individual drives of a<br>
workstation in a further embodiment of the open-end rotor spinning machine;<br>
Fig. 3	shows a schematic view of a spinning rotor;<br>

Fig. 5	shows a perspective view of a draw-off nozzle and a channel plate and<br>
a channel plate adapter.<br><br><br>
Fig. 1 shows one half of a semi-automatic open-end rotor spinning machine 1. Such spinning machines have a plurality of workstations 2, which are in each case equipped with a spinning mechanism 3 and a winding device 33. In the spinning mechanisms 3, the fibre band 34 fed in spinning cans 28 is spun in each case to form a thread 30 which is wound on the winding device 33 to form a cross-wound bobbin 22. The winding devices 33 in this case have, as known per se, a respective creel 21 for the rotatable holding of the tube of a cross-wound bobbin 22, a winding drive roller 23, a thread traversing device 26 and a device 7 for lifting the cross-wound bobbin 22 from the bobbin drive roller 23.<br>
The device 7 is, for example, configured as a thrust piston gear which is connected via a pneumatic line 24, into which an electromagnetic valve 17 is connected, to an excess pressure source (not shown).<br>
In the present embodiment, the drive of the bobbin drive roller 23 is implemented as a group drive. In other words, a drive shaft along the length of the machine is provided, to which the individual bobbin drive rollers 23 are fixed. In an alternative embodiment, however, a single motor drive of the bobbin drive roller 23 is also possible. In a case such as this, the drive of the bobbin drive roller 23 is connected by a corresponding control line to the spinning station's own control device 9.<br>
In the region of the winding device 33, a thread lifting device (not shown), known per se, may also be installed. A thread lifting device of this type prevents the thread unintentionally being able to be captured during the piecing process by the traversing thread traversing device 26. In other words, the thread lifting device configured, for example, as a foldable plate firstly holds the thread 30 during the actual piecing process at a spacing above the thread traversing device 26 moving back and forth.<br>
The spinning mechanism 3 substantially, as known, has a spinning rotor 4, a fibre band opening roller 12 and a fibre band draw-in cylinder 14.<br><br><br>
According to the embodiment of Fig. 1, the spinning rotor 4 is, for example, mounted in a support disc bearing 5 and is driven by a tangential belt 6 along the length of the machine.<br>
To record the rotational speed of the spinning rotor 4, a sensor device 8 may also be provided which is then connected via a signal line 40 to the control device 9. The fibre band opening roller 12 is preferably also acted upon via a tangential belt 13 along the length of the machine, while the fibre band draw-in cylinder 14 is driven by a single motor via a drive 15.<br>
The drive of the fibre band draw-in cylinder 14, for example a stepping motor 15 is also connected to the control device 9 via a control line 16. Furthermore, the workstations 2 in each case have a thread draw-off device 18, the drive 19 of which is connected to the control device 9 via a control line 20.<br>
Arranged in the region of the workstation 2 is a transceiver 38, which allows the contactless reading out and writing of transponders 37 which are arranged on the exchangeable components of the workstation 2 or are integrated in them, as shown in Fig. 3 with the aid of the spinning rotor 4. The transceiver 38 is connected to the spinning station's own control device 9 via a control line 39.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, which is shown in Fig. 2, the spinning rotor 4 is not supported in a support disc bearing 5, but in a magnetic bearing indicated only schematically. The spinning rotor 4 is preferably acted upon in a case such as this by a single drive 31.<br>
The spinning rotor drive 31 is in this case connected to the control device 9 via a<br>
control line 45.  As further shown in the embodiment according to Fig. 2, the fibre<br>
band opening roller 12 may also be driven by a single motor.   In other words<br>
arranged inside the clothing ring of the fibre band opening roller 12 is, for example,<br>
an external rotor drive 59 which is also connected to the control device 9 via a<br>
control line 32.<br><br><br>
An exchangeable component of the workstation 2, the spinning rotor 4 can be inferred from the view of Fig. 3. The spinning rotor 4 is provided on the outside of the spinning cup 35 with a passive transponder 37. Alternatively, active transponders can also be used; in other words, the transponders have their own current supply mechanism. This influences the range within which the data can be received and transmitted by the transponder.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show further exchangeable components of an open-end rotor spinning machine, such as a support disc 58, a draw-off nozzle 56, a channel plate 55 and a channel plate adapter 56 which are in each case equipped with a transponder 37 for recording operating data.<br>
The method according to the invention is described in more detail with the aid of the exchange of the spinning rotor 4. If a new, previously unused spinning rotor 4 is used in a workstation 2, the transponder 37 arranged on the spinning rotor cup 35 is detected upon supply to the workstation 2 by the transceiver 38, which leads to an activation of the transponder 37. The operating data stored at this time in the transponder 37 are read out and passed to the control device 9. The operating data are details about the previous period of use, use conditions such as rotor speed, throughput, number of thread breaks and the like, in particular operating data which are suitable to characterise the behaviour of the spinning rotor as a function of the degree of wear.<br>
Since, as already mentioned this involves an unused spinning rotor 4, the lifecycle of which begins with its first use in the workstation 2, first of all the time at which the spinning rotor 4 is first put into operation is stored on the transponder 37. The operating data required for this are passed from the control device 9 to the transceiver 38 of the relevant workstation 2. All the operating data which directly relate to the spinning rotor 4 and determine its wear behaviour, are now recorded when the spinning rotor is put into operation. The providing of these operating data<br><br><br>
likewise takes place by means of the control device 9. The operating data to be recorded are for example batch data, in particular the fibre material use and the quantity of fibre band processed which was supplied to the spinning rotor 4 during its use on this open-end rotor spinning machine 1. Thus, at any time, the throughput of the batch processed last or the total throughput of the spinning rotor 4 can be determined.<br>
Furthermore, for example, the rotational speeds of the spinning rotor 4 recorded by the sensor device 8 or the rotational speed adjusted at the control device 9 are passed to the transceiver 38 and transmitted to the transponder 37. Furthermore, the number of thread breaks at the workstation 2 is recorded and transmitted to the transponder 37.<br>
This flow of information is maintained over the entire residence time of the spinning rotor 4 in the workstation 2. In the process, the operating data to be recorded are constantly updated on the occurrence of a work interruption, for example at the beginning of a bobbin change to ensure gap-free recording of the operating data of the spinning rotor 4.<br>
When a change of the spinning rotor 4 is required, for example because of a batch change, the operating data stored in the transponder 37 are retained. If at a later point in time, the same spinning rotor 4 is installed in another open-end rotor spinning machine, the operating data of the spinning rotor 4 recorded and stored over the previous lifecycle are read out as already written at this textile machine and are available for evaluation of the state of wear independently of the previous use of the spinning rotor 4.<br><br><br>
For this purpose, the operating data stored in the transponders 37 of the exchangeable components can be read out independently of their use in the workstations 2 of the textile machine 1. Reading out can take place by means of a hand device or the like so as to be able to categorise components to be exchanged before their use in the workstations 2.<br>
The method according to the invention can also be correspondingly used, for example, for the fibre band opening roller 12, the support disc 58, the draw-off nozzle 56, the channel plate 55 or the channel plate adapter 57 of the open-end rotor spinning machine.<br><br><br>
