				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of bio-fuel synthesis, and<br>
more particularly, relates to a new process for producing biodiesel from<br>
renewable oil under lipase catalysis in an organic medium reaction<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
As a promising material of renewable oil industry, biodiesel is a long<br>
chain fatty acid ester produced from renewable oil through<br>
rransesterification reaction. Biodiesel is a novel, pollutionless and<br>
recoverable energy source. The combustion performance of biodiesel is<br>
comparable with the conventional petroleum based diesel, while after<br>
combustion, the content of harmful substances in the exhaust gas<br>
decreases approximately by 50% as compared with the conventional<br>
petroleum-based diesel. By far, wide attentions have been drawn to the<br>
studies and applications regarding biodiesel.<br>
Currently, biodiesel is manufactured mainly through chemical<br>
methods. Particularly, vegetable oils and/or animal fats are used as a<br>
source of long chain fatty acids and a transesterification reaction between<br>
the long chain fatty acids and some short chain alcohols, such as<br>
methanol or ethanol, is earned out in the presence of an acid or base<br>
catalyst, and short chain ester of the fatty acids are obtained. However.<br>
some inevitable disadvantages exist in chemical methods as follows::<br>
(1). Free fatty acid and water contained in the renewable oil raw<br>
material severely spoil the reaction;<br>
(2). Emulsion is undesirably formed due to the poor solubility of<br>
alcohol in renewable oils, and the subsequent treatment steps are<br>
complicated;<br><br>
(3). As required by the process, the amount of short chain alcohol<br>
used is much more than the reaction molar ratio, and the<br>
evaporation/reflux of the excess short chain alcohol leads to increased<br>
energy consumption.<br>
In contrast, synthesizing biodiesel through a biological enzyme<br>
method has the following advantages: mild reaction conditions, non-toxic<br>
emissions, and enzyme-catalyzed reactions am not affected by the free<br>
fatty acid and small amount of water contained in the renev/able oil raw<br>
materials. Therefore, bio-methods are consistent with the requirement of<br>
developing Green Chemistry, and thus nave attracted more and more<br>
attention,<br>
However, when compared with the chemical process, there exist<br>
some problems in the biological enzyme process. In an article entitled<br>
Enzymatic alcoholysis for biodiesel fuel production and application of the<br>
reaction to oil processing (Journal of Molecular Catalysis B: Enzymatic,<br>
2002, 17: 133-142) written by Shimada Yuji et al„ it is reported that<br>
firstly, the poor solubility of short chain alcofols, such as methanol and<br>
ethanol, in the renewable oil raw material is unfavorable for the reaction;<br>
and secondly, the presence of the excess alcohol may lead to severe<br>
deactivation of the enzyme. Therefore, during the process of biodiesel<br>
production by the biological enzyme method, batch addition of short<br>
chain alcohol is generally adopted to moderate the poisonous effect<br>
imposed on the enzyme. However, this process is complicated in<br>
operation and needs long reaction time. Additionally, a short chain<br>
alcohol is used as an acyl acceptor, and byproduct glycerin is produced<br>
during the course of reaction, then the hydrophilic glycerin readily<br>
adheres to the inner pores and the outer strface of the immobilized<br>
enzyme forming a "shield" on the active sites of the enzyme, and severely<br>
affecting the reactivity of the enzyme. Furthermore, the yield of biodiesel<br>
synthesized by the enzyme process is relatively low compared with that<br>
by the conventional chemical process. To solve above-mentioned<br>
problems in a biological enzyme proce s, some scholars have tried to<br><br>
produce biodiesel in organic solvent reaction svstem. It is reported in an<br>
article entitled Enzymatic alcoholysis for biodiesel fuel production and<br>
application of the reaction to oil processing (Journal of Molecular<br>
Catalysis B: Enzymatic, 2002, 17: 133-142) written by Shimada Yuji et al<br>
that, some relatively strong hydrophobic organic solvents, such as hexane,<br>
cyclohexane and petroleum, ether can be used as reaction medium. These<br>
hydrophobic solvents can dissolve renewable oil very well, thus<br>
promoting the reaction to some extent. However, because these highly<br>
hydrophobic solvents can not dissolve lower carbon alcohol, such as<br>
methanol, as well as the byproduct glycerin effectively, the reactivity and<br>
lifetime of the enzyme, and the yield of biodiesel can not be improved<br>
notably.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a new<br>
process for producing biodiesel from renewable oil raw material under<br>
lipase catalysis in an organic medium reaction system. In this process, a<br>
short chain alcohol ROH is used as an acyl acceptor, a relatively<br>
hydrophilic organic solvent having no negative effect on the reactivity of<br>
lipase is used as the reaction medium, and a renewable oil raw material is<br>
catalyzed by a lipase to synthesize biodiesel through a transestenfication<br>
reaction. The process of the present mvention is characterized in that: a<br>
short chain alcohol and a renewable oil raw material having an<br>
alcohol/renewable oil molar ratio of 3:1 to 6:1. together with 20 to 200%<br>
by volume of an organic solvent based on the volume of the renewable oil,<br>
and 2 to 30% by weight of a lipase based on the weight of the renewable<br>
oil are added into an enzyme reactor and mixec evenly, and the mixture is<br>
heated to 20 to 60'C to react for 4-24 hours tc convert the renewable oil<br>
raw material into biodiesel and a byproduct glycerin.<br>
BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the process according to the present invention, said relatively<br>
hydrophilic organic solvent is preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of tert-butanol and short chain farty acid ester RCOOR'.<br><br><br>
wherein R and R' are independently an alkyl group having 1-4 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
Said lipase is preferably a microorgamsm lipase, and is more<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting Lipozyme TL, Lipozyme<br>
RM, Novozym 435, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Said renewable oil comprises biological renewable oils, and<br>
preferably comprises vegetable oil, animal oil and fat, waste edible oil<br>
and residues of refined oil.<br>
Said vegetable oil comprises castor oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil,<br>
peanut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, rice oil, algae oil and mixtures thereof.<br>
Said animal oil and fat comprise fish oil, lard and mixture thereof.<br>
In said short chain alcohol ROH, R is an a kyl group having 1 to 5<br>
carbon atoms, and preferably said short chain alcohol comprises methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol.<br>
Preferably, the reaction molar ratio of said short chain alcohol to<br>
said renewable oil is 3:1 to 5:1, and the amount of the organic solvent<br>
added is 50% to 100% by volume based on the volume of the renewable<br>
oil.<br>
Said enzyme reactor may be a triangle fla;k with a plug, or other<br>
suitable enzyme reactors. Preferably, the heating step is carried out in an<br>
automatically thermostatic oscillating shaker or in various other<br>
bio-reactors suitable for enzyme catalyzed leaction. The preferred<br>
temperature for the reaction is 30 to 50°C.<br>
The advantages of the process of the present invention comprise the<br>
improvement of the lipase reactivity, prolongation of the lifetime of the<br>
lipase, and remarkable increase in the yield of biodiesel. This new<br><br><br>
organic medium reaction system promotes the solubility of the short<br>
chain alcohol in the renewable oil raw material, and effectively decrease<br>
the negative influence imposed on the lipase reactivity by the short chain<br>
alcohol. In the organic medium reaction system, the desired short chain<br>
alcohol may be added in one step to shorten the reaction time notably,<br>
and the yield of biodiesel is increased to 94% or more. Furthermore, the<br>
relatively hydrophilic organic solvent dissolves part of the byproduct<br>
glycerin and thus the "shield" effect imposed on the immobilized lipase<br>
pores by glycerin is avoided, and the lipase reactivity and lifetime are<br>
improved.<br>
