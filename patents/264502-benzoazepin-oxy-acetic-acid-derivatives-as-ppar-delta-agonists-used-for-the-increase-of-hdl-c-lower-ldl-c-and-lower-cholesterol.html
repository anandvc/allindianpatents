CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application<br>
60/793,001, filed on April 18,2006, which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED<br>
RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
The research and development of the invention described below was<br>
not federally sponsored.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are<br>
considered to be metabolic sensors regulating the expression of genes<br>
involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis. They are members of nuclear<br>
receptor superfamily of RXR heterodimers and are ligand-activated<br>
transcription factors. Agonists of the PPARcc (e.g., Gemfibrozil) and PPARy<br>
(e.g., Avandia®) subtypes are used for the treatment of dyslipidemias and<br>
diabetes, respectively. Each receptor has a distinct tissue distribution with<br>
PPARα showing highest expression in liver, PPARγ in adipose tissue and<br>
PPARS having the widest distribution being ubiquitously expressed in adult<br>
rat (Braissant et al., 1996) and in humans, expression was found in many<br>
different tissues involved in lipid metabolism including liver, kidney,<br>
abdominal adipose and skeletal muscle (Auboeuf et al., 1997).<br><br>
Recently, potent ligands for PPARδ have been published allowing a<br>
better understanding of its function in lipid metabolism (Barak et al, 2002;<br>
. Oliver et al., 2001; Tanaka et al, 2003; Wang et al., 2003). The main effect<br>
of these compounds in db/db mice (Leibowitz et al., 2000) and obese rhesus<br>
monkeys (Oliver et al., 2001) was an increase of high density lipoprotein<br>
cholesterol (HDL-C) and a decrease in triglycerides with little effect on<br>
glucose (although insulin levels were decreased in monkeys). HDL-C serves<br>
to remove cholesterol from peripheral cells through a process called reverse<br>
cholesterol transport. The first and rate-limiting step, which is a transfer of<br>
cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to the apolipoprotein A-l component of<br>
HDL, is mediated by the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)<br>
(Lawn et al., 1999). PPAR5 activation appears to increase HDL-C through<br>
transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 (Oliver et al., 2001). Therefore, by<br>
inducing ABCA1 mRNA in macrophages, PPAR5 agonists could increase<br>
HDL-C levels in patients and remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden<br>
macrophages, one of the major players in atherosclerotic lesion<br>
development. This would be an alternative therapy to the statin drugs, which<br>
show little effect on HDL-C and mainly decrease LDL-C or the fibrates, the<br>
only marketed PPARcx agonists, having low potency and inducing only<br>
modest HDL-C elevations. In addition, like the fibrates, PPAR5 agonists<br>
have the potential to also reduce triglycerides, an additional risk factor for<br>
cardiovascular disease.<br>
Examples of known PPAR delta agonists variously useful for<br>
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or atherosclerosis include L-165041 (Leibowitz et<br>
al., 2000) and GW501516 (Oliver et al., 2001). There is a continuing need<br>
for new PPAR delta agonists. There is a further need for new PPAR delta<br>
agonists that increase HDL-C, lower LDL-C, and/or lower cholesterol. There<br>
is a further need for new PPAR delta agonists for the treatment of diabetes,<br>
nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, polycystic ovary syndrome,<br><br>
hypertension, ischemia, stroke, irritable bowel disorder, inflammation,<br>
cataract, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic X Syndrome, hyper-LDL-<br>
cholesterolemia, dyslipidemia (including hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipiderma, and hypo-HDL-<br>
cholesterolemia), atherosclerosis, obesity, and other disorders related to lipid<br>
metabolism and energy homeostasis complications thereof.<br>

compound selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br><br>
and enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, solvates, or pharmaceutlcally<br>
acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be present in the<br>
form of pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts. For use in medicine, the salts of<br>
the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic "pharmaceuticalty<br>
acceptable salts" (Ref. International J. Pharm., 1986, 33,201-217; J.<br>
Pharm.Sci., 1997 (Jan), 66, 1,1). Other salts well known to those in the art<br>
may, however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this<br>
invention or of their pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts. Representative<br>
organic or inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic,<br>
propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartanc, citric,<br>
benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Representative organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited to,<br>
basic or cationic salts such as benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline,<br>
diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, procaine, aluminum, calcium,<br>
lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds that are readily convertible in vivo into the<br>
required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with<br><br>
a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to<br>
the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient.<br>
Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable<br>
prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed.<br>
H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Representative hydroxy group prodrug forms<br>
include, but are not limited to, C1-4alkanylethers, substituted C1-<br>
4alkanylethers, and C1-4alkanyl esters.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist<br>
as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures<br>
thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present<br>
invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water<br>
(i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also<br>
intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according<br>
to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toIuoyl-d-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br><br>
Thus, another embodiment of the present invention is a composition<br>
comprising the dextrorotatory enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I),<br>
wherein said composition is substantially free from the levorotatory isomer of<br>
said compound. In the present context, substantially free means less than<br>
25 %, preferably less than 10 %, more preferably less than 5 %, even more<br>
preferably less than 2 % and even more preferably less than 1 % of the<br>
levorotatory isomer calculated as.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a composition<br>
comprising the levorotatory enantiomer of a compound of formula (l) wherein<br>
said composition is substantially free from the dextrorotatory isomer of said<br>
compound. In the present context, substantially free from means less than<br>
25 %, preferably less than 10 %, more preferably less than 5 %, even more<br>
preferably less than 2 % and even more preferably less than 1 % of the<br>
dextrorotatory isomer calculated as<br><br>
For example, the present invention is also directed to a compound<br>
selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br><br>
wherin the compound is substantially free from the corresponding other<br>
enantiomer.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive<br>
or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be<br>
achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those<br>
described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie,<br>
Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be<br>
removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the<br>
art.<br>
Even though the compounds of the present invention {including their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in<br>
admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent selected with<br>
regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical<br>
or veterinary practice. Thus, the present invention is directed to<br>
pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions comprising compounds of<br>
Formula (I) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients<br>
or diluents.<br>
By way of example, in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention, the compounds of the present invention may be admixed with any<br><br>
suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agents), coating agent<s and></s>
solubilising agent(s).<br>
Tablets or capsules of the compounds may be administered singly or<br>
two or more at a time, as appropriate. It is also possible to administer the<br>
compounds in sustained release formulations.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the general Formula (I) can be<br>
administered by inhalation or in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they<br>
may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or<br>
dusting powder. An alternative means of transdermal administration is by<br>
use of a skin patch. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream<br>
consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin.<br>
They can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by<br>
weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base<br>
together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
For some applications, preferably the compositions are administered<br>
orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose,<br>
or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the<br>
form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring<br>
agents.<br>
The compositions (as well as the compounds alone) can also be<br>
injected parenterally, for example intracavernosally, intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly or subcutaneously. In this case, the compositions will<br>
comprise a suitable carrier or diluent.<br>
For parenteral administration, the compositions are best used in the<br>
form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for<br>
example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with<br>
blood.<br><br>
For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be<br>
administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a<br>
conventional manner.<br>
By way of further example, pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
one or more of the compounds of the invention described herein as the<br>
active ingredient can be prepared by intimately mixing the compound or<br>
compounds with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending upon the desired route of administration (e.g.,<br>
oral, parenteral). Thus for liquid oral preparations such as suspensions,<br>
elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols,<br>
oils, aicohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, stabilizers, coloring agents<br>
and the like; for solid oral preparations, such as powders, capsules and<br>
tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents,<br>
granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like.<br>
Solid oral preparations may also be coated with substances such as sugars<br>
or be enteric-coated so as to modulate the major site of absorption. For<br>
parenteral administration, the carrier will usually consist of sterile water and<br>
other ingredients may be added to increase solubility or preservation.<br>
Injectable suspensions or solutions may also be prepared utilizing aqueous<br>
carriers along with appropriate additives.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form<br>
via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal-skin<br>
patches well known to those skilled in that art.<br><br>
it is also apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically<br>
effective dose for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof will vary according to the desired effect. Therefore,<br>
optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined and will vary<br>
with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength<br>
of the preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition. In<br>
addition, factors associated with the particular subject being treated,<br>
including subject age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in<br>
the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate therapeutic level. The above<br>
dosages are thus exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be<br>
individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and<br>
such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the<br>
foregoing compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those<br>
compositions and dosage regimens established in the art whenever use of the<br>
compounds of the invention is required for a subject in need thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising<br>
one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions of the invention. Optionally<br>
associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a<br>
governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of<br>
Pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the<br>
agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutical composition is preferably<br>
provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01,10.0,50.0,100,160,200,250,<br>
and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of<br>
the dosage to the subject to be treated.<br><br>
invention include, but are not limited to, diabetes, nephropathy, neuropathy,<br>
retinopathy, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, ischemia, stroke,<br>
irritable bowel disorder, inflammation, cataract, cardiovascular diseases,<br>
Metabolic X Syndrome, hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia, dyslipidemia (including<br>
hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, and hypo-<br>
HDL-cholesterolemia), atherosclerosis, obesity, and other disorders related<br>
to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis complications thereof.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are also useful as PPAR delta<br>
agonists for treating, preventing, or inhibiting the progression of, a condition<br>
directly or indirectly mediated by PPAR delta.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are partcularly useful in<br>
treating diabetes, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome, hypertension, ischemia, stroke, irritable bowel disorder,<br>
inflammation, cataract, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic X Syndrome,<br>
hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia, dyslipidemia (including hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, and hypo-HDL-<br>
cholesterolemia), atherosclerosis, obesity, and other disorders related to lipid<br>
metabolism and energy homeostasis complications thereof.<br>
In regard to the use of the present compounds in treatment of the<br>
disases or conditions such as those listed above, a therapeutically effective<br>
dose can be determined by persons skilled in the art by the use of<br>
established animal models. Such a dose would likely fall in the range of<br>
from about 0.01 mg to about 15,000 mg of active ingredient administered 1<br>
to 4 times per day for an average (70 kg) human.<br>
GENERAL SYNTHETIC METHODS<br><br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be<br>
synthesized in accordance with the general synthetic methods described<br>
below as well as the illustrative examples that follow. Since the schemes are<br>
an illustration, the invention should not be construed as being limited by the<br>
chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the<br>
various starting materials used in the schemes is well within the skill of<br>
persons versed in the art.<br>
Scheme 1. General methods for the synthesis of<br>
Compounds of formula (Id)<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 1, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, X and Q are as<br>
described above, describes several general methods for the synthesis of<br>
compounds of Formula Id. For example, in Method 1, alkylation of the<br>
substituted benzoazepine 1-B with a compound of Formula 1-C where Y can<br>
be a leaving group such as Br, Cl, I, mesylate, etc. under a basic condition,<br>
such as CS2CO3 in CH3CN, can generate the corresponding compound of Id.<br>
In Method 2, reductive amination of 1-B with aryl aldehyde 1-D (e.g. R5 = H)<br>
by using NaBH(OAc)3 will generate Id; or reaction of 1-B with aryl ketone<br>
(e.g. R5 = C1-C3 alkyl) to give the shiff-base followed by reduction with<br>
NaCNBH3 will generate Id. In Method 3, reaction of 1-B with aryl aldehyde<br>
1-E to give the shiff-base followed by reaction with organo-alkyl reagents<br>
such as Grignard reagents, CH3Li or organo-cupper reagent, will also<br>
provide Id.<br>
Scheme 2. General methods for the synthesis of Compounds of formula (le)<br><br><br>
Scheme 2, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, X and Q are as<br>
described above, describes several general methods for the synthesis of<br>
compounds of Formula le. For example, in Method 1, reductive amination of<br>
1-B with aryl aldehyde 2-A (e.g. R5 = H) by using NaBH(OAc)3 will generate<br>
le; or reaction of 1-B with aryl ketone (e.g. R5 = C1-C3 alkyl) to give the shiff-<br>
base followed by reduction with NaCNBH3 will generate le. In Method 2,<br>
reaction of 1-B with aryl aldehyde 2-B to give the shiff-base followed by<br>
reaction with organo-alkyl reagents such as Grignard reagents, CH3Li or<br>
organo-cupper reagent, will also provide le.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) that are chiral may be separated into their<br>
enantiomers by chromatography on a chiral stationary phase. Alternatively,<br>
the basic compounds of the present invention may be converted to<br><br>
diastereomeric salts by mixture with a chiral acid and resolved into their<br>
enantiomers by fractional crystallization.<br>
It is generally preferred that the respective product of each process<br>
step be separated from other components of the reaction mixture and<br>
subjected to purification before its use as a starting material in a subsequent<br>
step. Separation techniques typically include evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation and filtration. Purification techniques typically include column<br>
chromatography (Still, W. C. et. al., J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43,2921), thin-layer<br>
chromatography, crystallization and distillation. The structures of the final<br>
products, intermediates and starting materials are confirmed by<br>
spectroscopic, spectrometric and analytical methods including nuciear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLQ. In the descriptions for the preparation of<br>
compounds of this invention, ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane are<br>
common examples of an ethereal solvent; benzene, toluene, hexanes and<br>
heptanes are typical hydrocarbon solvents and dichloromethane and<br>
dichloroethane are representative haiogenated hydrocarbon solvents. In<br>
those cases where the product is isolated as the acid addition salt the free<br>
base may be obtained by techniques known to those skilled in the art. In<br>

Example 2<br><br><br>
Rat Study of Compound 7<br>
Rats carry the majority of serum cholesterol in the HDL lipoprotein<br>
fraction while humans carry the majority of serum cholesterol in LDL and<br>
VLDL lipoproteins. To mimic a human hypercholesterolemic state in a<br>
rodent model, Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet high in cholesterol<br>
(Research Diets, C13002) for 6 days before treatment with the compounds<br>
for another 8 days while remaining on the diet. Under this dietary regimen,<br>
the vehicle controls (HC: High Cholesterol) typically have serum total<br>
cholesterol and LDL-C levels that are increased by 3-8 fold and serum HDL-<br>
C is decreased by approximately 30-50% compared with chow diet (lean)<br>
controls.<br>
Treatment of Sprague Dawley rats fed the high cholesterol diet with<br>
Compound 7 for 8 days significantly increased HDL-C levels, achieving the<br>
levels of the chow fed controls (Chow). There were also significant<br>
decreases in serum total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. Compound 7 had no<br>
effect on serum triglycerides or liver weights. There were dose-related<br>
increases in drug plasma levels (Cmax and AUC) and there may be<br>
accumulation after multiple doses as evidenced by the differences in Cmax<br>
and AUC between the single and multiple doses at 3mg/kg. Data from this<br>
study are shown in Tables 3 and 4 below.<br>
