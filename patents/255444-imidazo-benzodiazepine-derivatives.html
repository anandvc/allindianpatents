It has been found that this class of compounds show high affinity and selectivity for GABA A ot5 receptor binding sites and might be useful as cognitive enhancer or for the treatment of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of a, ß<br>
and y subunits.<br>
Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned<br><br>
and sequenced. Three types of subunits (a, ß and y) are required for the construction of recombinant GAB A A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GAB A A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the a and y subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, alß2y2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas ‹x2ß2y2, ‹x3ß2y2 and a5ß2y2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.<br>
It has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist ß-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, ß-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A ‹x5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A ct5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for a5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A a5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A al, a2 and a3 receptor binding sites are preferred.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The most preferred indication in accordance with the present invention is Alzheimer's disease.<br>

transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition alß3y2,<br>
a2ß3y2, ‹x3ß3y2 and ct5ß3y2.<br>

The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 °C.<br>
Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 µL (96-well plates) which contained 100 µL of cell memebranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for al, a2, a3 subunits and 0.5 nM for a5 subunits and the test compound in the<br><br>
range of 10"   ~ 3 x 10"6 M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10~5 M diazepam and typically represented less than 5 % of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 °C and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.<br>

It has been found that this class of compounds show high affinity and selectivity for GABA A ot5 receptor binding sites and might be useful as cognitive enhancer or for the treatment of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of a, ß<br>
and y subunits.<br>
Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned<br><br>
and sequenced. Three types of subunits (a, ß and y) are required for the construction of recombinant GAB A A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GAB A A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the a and y subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, alß2y2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas ‹x2ß2y2, ‹x3ß2y2 and a5ß2y2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.<br>
It has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist ß-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, ß-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A ‹x5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A ct5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for a5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A a5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A al, a2 and a3 receptor binding sites are preferred.<br>

The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Membrane preparation and binding assay<br>
The affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [3H]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably<br>
transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition alß3y2,<br>
a2ß3y2, ‹x3ß3y2 and ct5ß3y2.<br>
Cell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KC1, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 4 °C (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24 = 20000 rpm). The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 °C.<br>
Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 µL (96-well plates) which contained 100 µL of cell memebranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for al, a2, a3 subunits and 0.5 nM for a5 subunits and the test compound in the<br><br>
range of 10"   ~ 3 x 10"6 M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10~5 M diazepam and typically represented less than 5 % of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 °C and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.<br>
The compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [3H]flumazenil from a5 subunits of the rat GAB A A receptor of 1 uM or less. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the a5 subunit relative to the al, a2 and ot3 subunit.<br>
