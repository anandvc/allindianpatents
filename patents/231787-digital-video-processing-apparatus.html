Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a flow diagram showing a digital video processing method according to the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a digital video processing apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the present invention, in order to classify intensity of a video scene, motion information is used. Referring to FIG. 1, the digital video processing method according to the present invention includes the step of inputting video streams, preferably, MPEG-2 video streams, (step 100). Next, the video streams are grouped using a scene cut detection algorithm (step 102). Then, a group of video streams to be processed is selected (step 104). As known to one skilled in the art of MPEG, each of the video streams consists of a plurality of video frames. Video frames are classified as intra frames and inter frames. In the field of MPEG technology, the intra frames are generally referred to as I frames, and the inter frames include P frames and B frames. For convenience' sake of explanation, let B frames be P frames, then, the video frames are classified as I frames and P frames In other words, the selected group of video streams consist of I frames and P frames.<br>
Next, each P frame of the selected group of video streams is selected in<br>
i<br>
sequence (step 106). Then, in step 108, with respect to the selected P frame, the ratio (R) of the number of blocks whose motion compensation values are zero to the total number of macroblocks is calculated, as expressed in Expression (1):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
wherein NO_MC blocks are blocks whose motion compensation values are zero, among macrobiocks constituting the P frame. With respect to inter frames, the distribution of the blocks whose motion compensation values are zero is defined as motion activity.<br>
Next, the ratio R is quantized into one of five levels 1,, l2, 13, 14 and 15. For example, the levels I,, U, 1,, 14 and 15 refer to the cases where the ratios R are less than 5%, greater than or equal to 5% and less than 10%, greater than or equal to 10% and less than 30%, greater than or equal to 30% and less than 50%, and greater than or equal to 50%, respectively. In such a manner, processing of each P frame is completed.<br>
Next, it is checked whether the processed P frame is the last one (step 112). If not, the next P frame is selected (step 114) and the steps 106 through 110 are performed until the last P frame is processed. Then, supposing i is an integer from 1 to 5, and the ratio of the number of P frames in the ith level (li) to the total number of P frames in a region is denoted by Pi Pi, is calculated as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
to determine a region intensity histogram (RIH) as follows:<br>
RIH = (P„P2, P3, P4,P5)	(3)<br>
where the region denotes a selected group (step 116).<br>
Then, it is checked whether the selected group is the last one (step 118). If not, the next group is selected (step 120) and the steps 106 through 116 are performed.   In such a manner, the video processing for all groups is completed.<br>
According to the digital video processing method, the RIH information is obtained based on the motion compensation values of P frames. The RIH information is a good indicator of the motion information of a video scene. Also, RIH information is quite a good indicator of the intensity of the video scene.<br>
The digital video processing method is programmable by a computer. Codes and code segments constituting a computer program can be easily derived by a computer programmer in the art. Also, the program is stored in computer readable media and is read and executed by the computer, thereby embodying the digital video<br><br>
processing method. The media include magnetic recording media, optical recording media, carrier wave media, and the like.<br>
Also, the digital video processing method can be implemented on a digital video processing apparatus. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the digital video processing apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the digital video processing apparatus includes a grouping unit 200, a NOMC block ratio calculating unit 202, a quantizing unit 204, an RIH calculating unit 206, and an RIH information storage unit 208.<br>
In the operation of the digital video processing apparatus, the grouping unit 200 groups video streams using a scene cut detection algorithm, selects a group to be processed, and selects and outputs each P frame from the selected group in sequence.<br>
The NO_MC block ratio calculating unit 202 calculates the ratio of the number of blocks whose motion compensation values are zero to the total number of macroblocks, as defined in Expression (1) to output a ratio data R representing the calculated ratio.<br>
The quantizing unit 204 quantizes the ratio R into one of five levels 1,, 12, 13, 14 and 15 to then output level indication signals I,, I2,I3, I4 and I5, which indicate the respective levels. The respective levels I,, I2,13, I4 and I5 are for the cases where the ratios R are less than 5%, greater than or equal to 5% and less than 10%, greater than or equal to 10% and less than 30%, greater than or equal to 30% and less than 50%, and greater than or equal to 50%, respectively. In such a manner, processing of each P frame is completed.<br>
If processing of the last P frame is completed, the RIH calculating unit 206 calculates the ratio of the number of P frames in the j'th level (/,) to the total number of P frames in a region, which is denoted by P,. as represented by Expression (2) to then output region intensity histogram (RIH) data, as represented by Expression (3).<br>
The RIH information storage unit 208 receives the RIH information (P,, P:!. P,, P4 , P5) and stores the same therein. More preferably, the RIH information storage unit 208 receives video stream data, interleaves the RIH information with the video stream data and outputs RIH information interleaved video streams.<br><br>
By the video streams processed by the digital video processing method shown in FIG. 1 and using the digital video processing apparatus shown in FIG. 2, the intensities of two arbitrary video streams can be compared and analyzed.<br>
According to a digital video analyzing method of the present invention, the difference between RIH, and RIH2, i.e., Distance (RIH„ RIH2), is calculated as represented by Expression (4):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein, of two video streams in a given video scene. RIH information of the first video stream is RIHt, RIH information of the second video stream is RIH2, and M is a covariance matrix.<br>
The Distance (RIH1, RIH2) calculated by the above-described digital video analyzing method is properly indicative of the difference in intensity between two video streams.<br>
Using the video streams processed by the digital video processing method shown in FIG. 1, which is implemented on the digital video processing apparatus shown in FIG. 2, region searching can be effectively performed by a digital video searching method according to the present invention.<br>
The digital video searching method according to the present invention is based on the assumption that the video streams are processed by the digital video processing method shown in FIG. 1. In other words, it should be understood that the digital video searching method according to the present invention encompasses the digital video processing method which has been described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
According to the digital video searching method of the present invention, the RIH information of a selected vtdeo scene, that is, a video region, is first obtained<br>
Next, with respect to the video streams processed by the digital video processing method shown in FIG. 1. regions having similar RIH information, that is, video scenes having similar intensity, are searched for based on the obtained RIH information.<br>
Since the RIH information is determined based on motion compensation values of P frames, it is properly indicative of motion information of the video scene Also, the distribution of blocks whose motion compensatton values with respect to<br><br>
inter frames are zero, accounts for motion activity quite well. Further, in a video program, in particular, in a sports program, the motion information is" very closely related to the content of the pertinent video stream. The RIH information which is based on motion information is quite a good indicator of the intensity of a video scene. In other words, the video streams of scenes having similar intensities can be effectively searched by searching for similar video scenes based on the RIH information.<br>
The above-described digital video searching method can be applied to multimedia push/pull application fields such as content based video search engines.<br>
Also, the digital video searching method is programmable by a computer program. Codes and code segments constituting a computer program can be easily derived by a computer programmer in the art. Also, the program is stored in computer readable media and is readable and executable by the computer, thereby embodying the digital video searching method. The media include magnetic recording media, optical recording media, carrier wave media, and the like.<br>
Also, the digital video processing method can be embodied on a digital video searching apparatus (not shown). The digital video searching apparatus according to the present invention includes a grouping unit, a motion compensation information retrieving unit, and a searching unit.<br>
In the operation of the digital video searching apparatus, the grouping unit groups input video streams into a plurality of groups using a scene cut detection algorithm.<br>
The motion compensation information retrieving unit extracts information on motion compensation of P frames from a selected group and outputs processed video streams including the information as the RIH information of the selected group.<br>
The searching unit extracts RIH information of a selected group to be searched and searches for regions having similar RIH information based on the retrieved RIH information.<br>
The aforementioned digital video searching apparatus can effectively search the video streams of scenes having similar intensities by searching for similar video scenes based on the RIH information.<br><br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the RIH information is obtained based on the motion compensation values of inter frames, and the RIH information is a good indicator of motion information of a video scene. Also, since the RIH information is quite a good indicator of intensity of the video scene, video streams having similar intensities can be effectively searched by searching for similar video scenes based on the RIH information obtained by a digital video processing method of the present invention.<br>
