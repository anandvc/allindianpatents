Field of Invention :<br>
The invention relates to apparatus for, and to methods of, conditioning communications<br>
signals and configuring filters.<br>
Background of Invention :<br>
In a radio system, a signal travelling between a transmitter and a receiver will be perturbed<br>
by the environment in which the transmitter and the receiver exist.' The performance of a<br>
receiver, i.e. its ability to accurately recover from a received signal information that was<br>
put into the signal by a transmitter, depends, to a significant extent, on the ability of the<br>
receiver to remove perturbations caused by the environment.<br>
Environmental perturbations of a transmitted signal are usually ascribed to three main<br>
sources. These are noise, interference and multipath propagation. Noise may have many<br>
sources, including thermal noise from the general environment and circuit noise from<br>
within the receiver in question. Interference arises from other signals that are being<br>
transmitted in the vicinity of the receiver in question. Multipath propagation arises when a<br>
signal reaches a receiver from a transmitter by more than one path. An example of a<br>
situation in which multipath propagation occurs is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure la shows a transmitter 100 attempting to send a radio signal to a receiver 110.<br>
Three objects 112, 114 and 116 are located in the vicinity of the transmitter and the<br>
receiver 110. The radio signal emitted by the transmitter 100 can reach the receiver 110 by<br>
various paths. First, the radio signal can reach the receiver 110 by the direct path 118<br>
leading from the transmitter 100. The radio signal from the transmitter 100 can also reach<br>
the receiver 110 by reflection from objections 112 to 116. For example, the radio signal<br>
can travel along paths 120, 122 and 124 with reflection from objects 112, 114 and 116,<br>
respectively. It will be apparent that the paths 118 to 124 have different lengths with the<br>
result that the versions of the radio signal travelling along these paths will arrive at the<br>
receiver 110 with differing relative delays.<br>
It is common practice to characterise multipath propagation in terms of a graph showing<br>
how the power of a received signal is distributed with delay. Figure lb illustrates how<br><br>
such a plot might look for a radio signal travelling from transmitter 100 to receiver 110 in<br>
the presence of objects 112 to 116. Figure lb illustrates that the power in the received<br>
signal is spread over a range of delays and Figure 1c illustrates a sampled or digitised<br>
version of the power versus delay profile of Figure lb.	<br>
Commonly, the information to be conveyed by a radio signal emitted by a transmitter<br>
exists in the form of a series of information symbols. Multipath propagation can cause a<br>
phenomenon known as intersymbol interference (ISI). ISI occurs when paths leading to a<br>
receiver from a transmitter differ in length in a way which causes one information symbol<br>
in the radio signal arriving along one path to arrive at the receiver at the same time as<br>
another information symbol in the radio signal arriving at the receiver along another path.<br>
ISI can also be introduced by other mechanisms. For example, in an Enhanced Data rates<br>
for GSM Evolution (EDGE) system, a filter is used to constrain the bandwidth of a<br>
modulated GMSK or 8PSK signal prior to its emission from a transmitter (see, for<br>
example, 3GPP TS 45.004 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification<br>
Group GSM/EDGE; Radio Access Network). Moreover, a signal acquired by a receiver<br>
will usually undergo filtering of one form or another (for example, to reject interference in<br>
adjacent frequency channels that would otherwise reduce dynamic range). Such filtering<br>
mechanisms can be another source of ISI.<br>
It is usual to design a receiver to counteract, in the presence of interference and noise, ISI<br>
due to, for example, one or more of multipath propagation, filtering in a transmitter and<br>
filtering in a receiver and to estimate the information that was put into the signal by the<br>
transmitter that originated the signal. See, for example, "Digital Communications", John<br>
G. Proakis, McGraw-Hill International Series, 3rd Edition.<br>
There are many methods of counteracting ISI, which methods are known generically as<br>
"equalisation". Among these the following are worthy of note:<br>
1. Linear equalisation (see, for example, "Digital Communications", John G. Proakis,<br>
McGraw-Hill International Series, 3rd Edition);<br><br>
2.	Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) using the Viterbi algorithm<br>
(see, for example, ("Maximum-likelihood sequence estimation of digital sequences<br>
in the presence of intersymbol interference", Forney, G., Jr.; IEEE Transactions on<br>
Information Theory, Volume: 18, Issue: 3, May 1972 Pages: 363-378);<br>
3.	Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) (see, for example, "Optimum and sub-<br>
optimum detection of coded data disturbed by time-varying intersymbol<br>
interference [applicable to digital mobile radio receivers]", Koch, W.; Baier, A.;<br>
Global Telecommunications Conference, 1990, and Exhibition. "Communications:<br>
Connecting the Future", GLOBECOM '90., IEEE, 2-5 Dec. 1990 Pagra: 1679-1684<br>
vol. 3), and its lower complexity versions, the max-log-MAP; and<br>
4.	The soft-output Viterbi Algorithm (SOVA) ("A Viterbi algorithm with soft-decision<br>
outputs and its applications", Hagenauer, J,; Hoeher, P,; Global<br>
Telecommunications Conference, 1989, and Exhibition. "Communications<br>
Technology for the 1990s and Beyond". GLOBECOM '89., IEEE, 27-30 Nov.<br>
1989 Pages: 1680-1686 vol. 3).<br>
A number of reduced complexity ISI suppression methods exist, in particular Reduced<br>
State Sequence Estimation (RSSE) (see, for example, "Reduced-state sequence estimation<br>
with set partitioning and decision feedback", Eyuboglu, M. V.; Qureshi, S.U.H.; IEEE<br>
Transactions on Communications, Volume: 36, Issue: 1, Jan. 1988 Pages: 13-20) which<br>
can be of use for higher order modulation schemes such as 8PSK.<br>
In mathematical terms, it is possible to regard a received signal as arriving at a receiver<br>
from a transmitter through a channel consisting of a filter describing the various sources of<br>
ISI that affect the received signal. In this document, such a filter shall be referred to as a<br>
"channel" and the impulse response of such a filter shall be referred to as a "channel<br>
response" and an estimate or measurement of such an impulse response shall be referred to<br>
as a "channel estimate".<br>
In order for an equaliser to work successfully on a received signal, it is desirable to endow<br>
the equaliser with an accurate channel estimate for the signal. This consideration<br><br><br>
advocates the use of a channel estimate which is at least as long as the true channel.<br>
However, the length L of a channel estimate used by an equaliser will directly affect the<br>
complexity of the equaliser. In the case of a linear equaliser, the complexity will vary<br>
linearly with L. In the case of a SOVA equaliser, the complexity will rise exponentially<br>
with L. Thus, the length allowed for a channel estimate in an equalisation scheme is<br>
normally limited. If an equaliser uses a channel estimate whose length is shorter than the<br>
channel response, then the performance of the equaliser will suffer. In general terms, the<br>
greater the proportion of the power of the received signal that lies in the portion of the<br>
channel response that lies beyond the length of the channel estimate, the worse the<br>
performance of the equaliser will be. For this reason, careful thought must be given to the<br>
design of filtering processes in transmitters and receivers to avoid unduly increasing the<br>
length of the channel response of signals presented for equalisation.<br>
It has been found that enhanced equalisation performance can be achieved by using an<br>
equalisation scheme comprised of a linear equaliser for conditioning a received signal prior<br>
to the processing of the signal using a more complicated equalisation scheme, such as a<br>
delayed decision feedback sequence estimation (DDFSE) scheme. See, for example,<br>
"Design of an interference-resistant equaliser for EDGE cellular radio systems" M.<br>
Barberis, S. Heinen, P. Guerra; Vehicular Technology Conference 2002. Proceedings.<br>
VTC 2052-Fall. 2002 IEEE 56th, Volume: 3, 24-28 September 2002, Pages: 1622-1626<br>
vol. 3). In such a composite equalisation scheme, the linear equaliser is used to partially<br>
remove ISI and to condition noise and interference, thereby aiding the channel estimation<br>
and equalisation processes of the succeeding higher complexity equalisation Scheme. The<br>
inventors of the present patent application have realised that a linear equaliser used in such<br>
a capacity must be carefully controlled in order to avoid unduly lengthening the channel<br>
response of the signal as perceived by the higher complexity equalisation scheme following<br>
the linear equaliser relative to the length of the channel estimate that is used by the higher<br>
complexity equalisation scheme.<br>

Dataikd description of preferred enfcodiroants :<br>
Figure 2 shows an EDGE radio system 200 in which a transmitter 210 attempts to convey<br>
an information signal u to a receiver 212. The use of bold text denotes that the information<br>
signal is a vector consisting of a stream of samples un where n=0,1,2,3 ... and the same<br>
convention is used below in relation to other signals and some impulse responses.<br>
In the transmitter 210, the information signal u undergoes error protection coding in unit<br>
214 to produce an error-coded signal d. An example of error protection coding is the<br>
convolutional coding used in an EDGE radio system (see 3GPP TS 45.003 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE; Radio Access Network).<br>
The error-coded signal d is then supplied to unit 216 where the signal undergoes<br>
modulation and becomes modulated signal x. The signal x then passes through a filter 217.<br>
The role of the filter 217 is to constrain the bandwidth of the signal x. , The impulse<br>
response sof the filter 217 is a. After filtering by filter 217, the signal x is emitted from the<br>
transmitter 210 and travels through a channel 218 and arrives at the receiver 212 as a<br>
signal s. The channel describes the effect of the environment on the signal x and has a<br>
channel response c.<br>
In the receiver 212, the signal s is initially processed by a front-end section 220. Within<br>
the front-end section 220, the signal s is filtered by a filter 221. The role of the filter 221 is<br>
to reject signals in adjacent frequency channels that might interfere with the desired signal,<br>
s. The signal s emerges from the front-end section 220 as a signal r which is then<br>
conditioned by a pre-filter 222 and becomes signal y which is then supplied to a<br>
demodulation unit 224. The demodulation unit 224 uses a SOVA scheme to equalise the<br><br>
signal r as conditioned by the pre-filter 222. The pre-filter 222 is an MSE linear equaliser<br>
and its purpose is to partially remove ISI present in signal r and to condition the noise and<br>
interference present in symbol r, thereby aiding the channel estimation and equalisation<br>
processes carried out in the demodulation unit 224. The operation of the pre-filter 222 is<br>
controlled by control unit 223, whose function will be described later. Together, the pre-<br>
filter 222 and the SOVA scheme used in the demodulation unit 224 constitute a composite<br>
equalisation scheme. A demodulated version e of the signal r emerges from the<br>
demodulation unit 224 and proceeds to an error decoding unit 226. The error decoding unit<br>
226 utilises knowledge about the error protection coding applied by unii 214 in the<br>
transmitter 200 in order to produce a signal i that is an estimate of the information signal u.<br>
It will be apparent that most of the signal processing shown in Figure 2 occurs in the<br>
digital domain with digital to analogue and analogue to digital conversion occurring before<br>
filter 217 and after filter 221, respectively.<br>
The signal r that enters the composite equalisation scheme can be thought of as a version<br>
of the signal x that has arrived through a channel having a channel response h where h has<br>
the form h = a®c®b, where <g> denotes the convolution operation. An example form for<br>
the signal channel response h is shown in Figure 3. In the example shown, the channel<br>
response r contains three contains three multipath components n, r2 and r-3. These<br>
multipatti components manifest themselves as peaks 300, 310 and 312. The channel<br>
response h is a summation of the channel responses of the individual mulitpath<br>
components such that h = hi + h2 + h3 where hi, h2 and h3 are the channel responses of the<br>
multipath components n, r2 and r3i respectively. The channel responses hi, h2 and h3 are<br>
shown superimposed on one another in Figure 4 as curves 400, 410 and 412, respectively.<br>
The pre-filter 222 has an impulse response p. If one notionally decomposes r into its<br>
multipath components ri, r2 and r3 and considers the pre-filter 222 as acting on the<br>
multipatil components n, r2 and r3 individually, then, at the output of the pre-filter, the<br>
channel response of ri becomes p®h1 = g!_ the channel response of r2 becomes p®h2 = gz<br>
and the channel response of r3 becomes p®h3 = g3. Ideally, the pre-filter 222 operates to<br>
produce residual channel responses gi, g2 and g3 in the form of single impulses denoting<br>
the positions of the multipath components ri, r2 and r3 in the channel respond h. In order<br><br>
for the pre-filter 222 to produce such a result, however, it is required that r is such that hi =<br>
j®gi&gt; hz,= j®g2 and h3 = j®g3 where gi, g2 and g3 are single impulses and that p can be set<br>
to a vector w where w is such that w<g>j®x = x where x is an arbitrary signal. For the sake<br>
of clarity in the following description of the function of control unit 223, assume now that<br>
r conforms to the requirements stated in the previous sentence. The three impulses gi, g2<br>
and g3 are shown superposed in Figure 5, as impulses 500, 510 and 512, respectively.<br>
Since the pre-filter 222 performs filtering in the digital domain with a finite sample rate,<br>
the pre-filter can only produce an approximation w' of the impulse response w required to<br>
convert hi, h2 and h3 into the single impulses gi, g2 and g3. Assume now that w' is<br>
designed to operate on ri to convert hi into a residual channel response gi' that is a single<br>
impulse, i.e. gi = gi. The channel response gi' is shown in Figure 5, in which the single<br>
impulse is labelled 500. The pre-filter 222 with its impulse response w' will also operate<br>
on multipath components tz and r3 to convert h2 and h3 into residual channel responses gz<br>
and g3', respectively. Whether or not the pre-filter 222 produces g2' in the form of a single<br>
impulse that maps on to g2 will depend on the separation A1.2 between gi and g2, shown in<br>
Figure 5, and enumerated in terms of a number of sample periods of the pre-filter 222. If<br>
A1-2 is an integer number, then g2' will be a single impulse that maps on to g2. This result is<br>
shown in Figure 6 as impulse 600. However, if A1-2 is an non-integer number, then g2 will<br>
be broadened from an impulse into the curve shown in Figure 6 as a broken lfae and having<br>
a peak 610 and slowly decaying tails 612 and 614. The situation as regards g3 and its<br>
conformation to g3 is dependent in an analogous manner on the separation A1-3, again<br>
shown in Figure 5, between gi and g3.<br>
It will be apparent that, largely due to the slowly decaying tails 612 and 614, many more<br>
taps are required to describe the residual channel response represented by the broken line in<br>
Figure 6 than the single tap that is required to characterize impulse 600. Consequently, due<br>
to the finite sampling rate of the pre-filter 222, the channel response of signal r at the<br>
output of the pre-filter is likely to contain peaks encumbered with slowly decaying tails in<br>
place of impulses 510 and 512. Thus, the application of pre-filter 222 can result in a<br>
channel response that is longer than the length of the estimate used in demodulation 224;<br>
this worsens the performance of the receiver.<br><br>
In order restore efficacy to the pre-filter 222, the pre-filter is configured by the control unit<br>
223 so that the pre-filter does not have impulse response w' but rather has an impulse<br>
response w" = w'<g>q where q is an impulse response in the form of a Gaussian pulse<br>
having a shape proportional to:<br><br>
where t is the sample count and T is the sampling interval of the pre-filter 222.<br>
Accordingly, the pre-filter 222 now performs the operations -w"®hi, w"®h2 and w"®h3 on<br>
the multipath components ri, r2 and r3 respectively to produce residual channel responses<br>
&amp;"» g2" and ga" respectively.<br>
The residual channel response g2" is shown in Figure 7 alongside g2". The former is shown<br>
as a solid line and the latter as a broken line. It will be apparent that the tails are greatly<br>
suppressed in g2 when compared to g2'. Therefore, fewer taps are required to characterize<br>
the residual channel response g2" than are required to characterize the response g2'. The<br>
effect of w" on h\ is shown in Figure 8, in which gV is shown as a solid line and gi" is<br>
shown as a broken line. It will be apparent that the single impulse of g/ has in gi<br>
broadened and lowered into a peak of appreciable thickness. (The appearance of &amp;" will,<br>
of course, depend on the separation A,_3 in the same way that g2" depends on g2.<br>
However, the residual channel response gs" is not shown or described here for the sake of<br>
brevity.)<br>
The width — of the Gaussian pulse in q controls the degree of suppression of the tails in<br>
a<br>
g2" and the broadening of the peak in g/. The smaller a becomes^ the less severe the<br>
suppression of the tails in g^ will become and the narrower the peak in gi will become.<br>
Conversely, the greater a becomes, the greater the suppression of the tails will become in<br>
g2" and the broader the peak in gi" will become. It is usually possible to choose a value of<br>
a that provides a useful compromise in terms of the tail suppression and the peak<br>
broadening through trial and error in order to ensure that the pre-filter 222 succeeds in<br>
reducingsthe length of the channel response z of signal y.<br><br>
The shaping of the Gaussian pulse within q is dictated by control unit 223. The control<br>
unit 223 is shown in more detail in Figure 9. In addition to application to pre-filter 222, the<br>
signal r is also applied to an estimation unit 900 within the control unit 223. Estimation<br>
unit 900 calculates some metrics of the signal r and supplies them to filter configuration<br>
unit 910. Filter configuration unit 910 periodically recalculates V, a, q and w" and<br>
reconfigures the pre-filter 222 to operate with the new version of w" thus obtained. In<br>
simpler variants, w" or q is fixed at a form derived by trial and error research.<br>
Some alternatives to the pre-filter 222 and its control unit 223 will now be described with<br>
reference to Figures 10, 11, 14 and 15.<br>
In Figure 10, the pre-filter 222 and its control unit 223 are replaced by a group of pre-filters<br>
222a to c and a decision unit 1000. The pre-filters 222a to c have differing impulse<br>
responses* pa, pb and pc, respectively, and they operate in parallel on signal r to produce<br>
signals sa, Sb and sc, respectively. The decision unit 1000 calculates a quality metric \i for<br>
each of signals sa, Sb and sc and supplies the one of these signals with the best Value of \i to<br>
the demodulation unit 224 for further processing. The quality metric \x can be, for example,<br>
a noise power value calculated by first estimating the channel of a signal from a section of<br>
the signal containing a training sequence. This channel estimate is then convolved with the<br>
known training sequence and the result is subtracted from the section of the signal that was<br>
used to produce the channel estimate. The power in the residual signal section thus<br>
produced yields a value for u. At least one of the impulse responses pa, Pb and pc is<br>
derived in the same manner as w" in the system of Figure 2, i.e. involving convolution with<br>
a Gaussian pulse in order to suppress in the manner shown in Figure 7 tails, of the kind<br>
described with reference to Figure 6. Since the impulse responses pa, Pb an- pc are fixed,<br>
the arrangement shown in Figure 10 avoids the data processing overheads associated with<br>
the periodic recomputation of w" by control unit 223.<br>
In Figure 11, the control unit 223 is omitted and the adjustable pre-filter 222 is replaced<br>
with pre-rfilter 222d that uses a fixed, predetermined impulse response pa having the form<br>
wigiqa where w<g>[a®b] = 1 and q<j is proportional to a gaussian pulse and included></j>
suppress in the manner shown in Figure 7 tails of the kind shown in Figure 6. It will be<br>
recalled that a and b are the known impulse responses of filters 217 and 221, respectively.<br><br>
In Figure 14, instead of arranging that the pre-filter impulse response is modified by<br>
convolution with a Gaussian pulse, the pre-filter 222e is preceded by an inhibiting filter<br>
1400 that has an impulse response in the shape of a Gaussian pulse. Together, pre-filter<br>
222e and inhibiting filter 1400 have the same effect as pre-filter 222 in Figure 1. For<br>
example, given the scenario used in conjunction with Figure 2 wherein the pre-filter is<br>
given an impulse response w'®q, the pre-filter 222e in Figure 14 would be given impulse<br>
response w' and the inhibiting filter 1400 would be given impulse response q. It will be<br>
apparent to the skilled person that the inhibiting filter 1400 can be implemented with an<br>
impulse response that is, for example, periodically recalculated in an analogous manner to<br>
the recalculation of q as described in Figure 9, selected from amongst a number of<br>
available impulse responses in an analogous manner to the selection process performed by<br>
the decision unit 1000 in Figure 10, or fixed in analogy with impulse response qd in Figure<br>
11. It will also be apparent to the skilled person that the inhibiting filter could be relocated<br>
to a position following the pre-filter 222, as shown in Figure 15 (in which the inhibiting<br>
filter is relabelled 1500).<br>
In the systems described with reference to Figures 2,10 and 11, a Gaussian pulse is used in<br>
a convolution step to control tail growth in the channel response z of signal y and, in the<br>
systems described with reference to Figures 14 and 15, an inhibiting filter with an impulse<br>
response |n the shape of a Gaussian pulse is likewise used to control tail growth in channel<br>
response z. It will, however, be apparent to the skilled person that other kinds of pulse<br>
shape can be used in place of the Gaussian pulse and yet achieve the same result in<br>
controlling the length of the channel response z. For example, the pulse could be square,<br>
triangular or raised cosine in shape, the efficacy of the pulse depending on its precise<br>
shape.<br>
in another variant of the scheme described with reference to Figure 2, w does not attempt<br>
to eliminate the effect of a and b but only a such that w®a = 1. By arranging the pre-filter<br>
222^0 counteract a, the co-channel interference affecting r is whitened and this can benefit<br>
the operation of the SOVA equaliser operating on signal y within demodulation unit 224.<br>
Another variant of system 200 is shown in Figure 12. Reference symbols in Figure 12 that<br>
appear in Figure 2 continue to denote the same features as in Figure 2. For the purpose of<br>
simplifying the following discussion of the EDGE system 1200 shown r* Figure 12,<br><br>
assume that signal r has the structure described with reference to Figure 3 and that the<br>
three multipara components ri, r2 and r3 again have channel responses jigtgi, j®g2 and<br>
j<g>g3, respectively, where, as before, gl5 g2 and g3 are single impulses and Aw denotes the<br>
separation between impulses gi and g2 and A,_3 denotes the separate between impulses gi<br>
andg3.<br>
It will be recalled that in the system 200 the configuration of the pre-filter 222 with an<br>
impulse response w' having the property w'®j®gi = gi is rejected in favour of a<br>
configuration w" = w'<g>q, where q has a Gaussian pulse shape, in order to inhibit the<br>
lengthening of the channel response z of signal y. In system 1200, however, the control<br>
unit 223 configures the pre-filter 222 to have an impulse response w' having the property<br>
w'®j®gi = gi and undesirable growth in the length of z is instead inhibited through the<br>
agency of filters 217 and 221, as will now be described.	*<br>
The filters 217 and 221 with their impulse responses a and b respectively can, notionally,<br>
be replaced with a single filter F whose impulse response k is a®b. Conventionally, the<br>
filter 221 includes anti-aliasing filtering so that the frequency response of notional filter F<br>
is quiescent beyond the Nyquist limit of the pre-filter 222. However, in system 1200, the<br>
filters 217 and 221 are arranged such that notional filter F has a non-zero response in the<br>
part of its frequency response that lies beyond the Nyquist limit of the pre-filter 222. This<br>
extension of the frequency response of notional filter F causes aliasing in the* operation of<br>
the pre-filter 222 which, in turn, leads to suppression of the spreading effect in the channel<br>
response z of signal y that will arise if either or both of the alignments A,_2 and A,_3have<br>
non-integer values.<br>
A<br>
An example of the frequency response of notional filter F in system 1200 is shown in<br>
Figure 13 a. The frequency response shown there is sampled at a rate eight times higher<br>
than the sampling rate of the pre-filter 222 and features a non-zero response beyond the<br>
Nyquist limit of pre-filter 222, indicated by line A-A. Figure 13b shows two curves 1312<br>
and 1314 which illustrate how the response of the notional filter F would appear to a signal<br>
at the sample rate used by the pre-filter 222. Curve 1312 applies when the samples of the<br>
signal are aligned with the taps of the notional filter F and curve 1314 applies when the<br>
samples of the signal experiencing filter F are offset by a fraction of a sample relative to<br><br>
the taps of filter F. It will be apparent that curve 1314 drops away from curve 1312 at<br>
higher frequencies and the effect of this difference on the operation of the pve-filter 222<br>
will now be described.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, assume now that j = k such that the pre-filter 222 performs the<br>
convolutions w'®(k®gi) to produce gi', w'®(k®g2) to produce &amp; and w'®(k®g3) to<br>
produce &amp;' for the three multipath components. Curve 1300 in Figure 13c is the frequency<br>
domain representation of impulse response w'®k®gi sampled at the sampling rate of the<br>
pre-filter 222. As is apparent from Figure 13c, curve 1300 is fiat and this characteristic<br>
corresponds to a single impulse in the time domain, which is indeed the result rf w'®k®gi<br>
since it will be recalled that w' is designed to convert hi into the pure impulse gi. If A,_2 is<br>
integer, then w'®h2 will map to pure impulse g2 and the frequency response of w'®h2 (i.e.<br>
of w'®k®g2) will match curve 1300. However, if A^2 is non-integer, then w'®h2 will<br>
behave like curve 1310 and, after initially conforming to curve 1300, drop away due to the<br>
aliasing within the pre-filter 222 of the non-zero frequency response of k beyond the<br>
Nyquist limit of the pre-filter 222. In the time domain, this drop translates into a<br>
suppression, as in Figure 7, of the tails that form around the peak in the residual channel<br>
response w'®k®g2. The frequency response of w'®k®g3 likewise depends orf the value of<br>
A,_3.<br>
The system 1200 includes additional control units 1212 and 1210 for adjusting filters 217<br>
and 221, respectively, for the purpose of adjusting k to manipulate the drop in the curve<br>
1310 so as to produce a desired degree of tail suppression in residual channel responses<br>
responses g2' and g3'. In practice, trial and error would be used to find settings for filters<br>
217 and 221 that are optimum in terms of a balance between the degree of tail suppression<br>
in g2* and &amp; and other operating criteria. In certain embodiments, only h is rendered<br>
adjustable for the purpose of varying k.<br>
Several embodiments of the invention have now been described in which tail growth is<br>
suppressed in the channel response of the output of a pre-filter to an equalisation scheme.<br>
It will be apparent to the skilled person that many other variants of the invention exist. For<br>
example", the described embodiments assume that the information transmitted between the<br>
transmitter and receiver is formatted in blocks of bits rather than as a continuous stream. It<br><br>
will, however, be apparent that the invention is applicable to systems in which the<br>
information is transmitted as a continuous stream. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that<br>
the various units that operate on digital signals, for example, units 214 and 224, can be<br>
implemented as hardware structures or as software running on a general data processor or<br>
used in conjunction with customised data processing hardware.<br><br>
