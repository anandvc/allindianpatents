1.TITLE OF INVENTION PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED POLYSACCHARIDE<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever house, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to substituted polysaccharides, their synthesis, and graft polysaccharide polymers made therefrom.  The graft polymers find utility in laundry cleaning operations and provide soil release, fabric care and other laundry cleaning benefits.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The grafting of synthetic polymers onto a cellulosic backbone has been the subject of research activities for a long time with the object of producing a polymer that has the beneficial properties of both cellulose and the synthetic polymers. Enormous research and development efforts have occurred over the last 40 years, but no polymer or process has yet been discovered which has proceeded to commercialisation.<br>
The grafting of polymers on a cellulosic backbone proceeds through radical polymerisation wherein an ethylenic monomer is contacted with a soluble or insoluble cellulosic material together with a free radical initiator. The radical thus formed reacts on the cellulosic backbone (usually by proton abstraction) , creates radicals on the cellulosic chain, which subsequently react with monomers to form graft chains on the cellulosic backbone. Related techniques use other<br>
2<br><br>
sources of radical such as high energy irradiation or oxidising agents such as cerium salt or redox systems such as thiocarbonate-potassium bromate. These methods are well known, see, eg, McDonald, et al. Prog. Polym. Sci. 1984, 10, 1; Hebeish et al, "The Chemistry and Technology of cellulosic copolymers", (Springer Verlag, 1981); Samal et al. J Macromol. Sci-Rev.Macromol. Chem. 1986, 26, 81; Waly et al, Polymers &amp; polymer composites 4,1,53,1996; and D. Klenn et al,, Comprehensive Cellulose Chemistry, vol. 2 "Functionalization of Cellulose" pp. 17-31 (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1998) .<br>
Another strategy involves functionalising the cellulose backbone with a reactive double bond and polymerising in the presence of monomers under conventional free radical polymerisation conditions, see, eg, US 4 758 645 (Nippon Paint).  Alternatively, a free radical initiator is covalently linked to the polysaccharide backbone to generate a radical from the backbone to initiate polymerisation and form graft copolymers.   For example, in US 4 206 108 (Du Pont) , a thiol is covalently bound to a polymeric backbone with pendant hydroxy groups via a urethane linkage; this polymer containing mercapto group is then reacted with ethylenically unsaturated monomers to form the graft copolymer.<br>
Unfortunately, none of these techniques lead to a well-defined material with a controlled macrostructure and microstructure. For instance, none of these techniques leads to a good control of both the number of graft chains per cellulose backbone molecule and molecular weight of the<br>
3<br><br>
graft chains. Moreover, side reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to avoid, including the formation of un-grafted polymer, graft chain degradation and/or crosslinking of the grafted chains.<br>
In an attempt to solve these problems, pre-formed chains have been chemically grafted onto cellulosic polymers. For instance, in US 4 891 404, polystyrene chains were grown in an anionic polymerisation and capped with, eg, CO2. These grafts were then attached to mesylated or tosylated cellulose triacetate by nucleophilic displacement. This method is difficult to commercialise because of the stringent conditions required by the method. Moreover, the set of monomers that can be used in this method is restricted to non-polar olefins, thus precluding any application in water media.<br>
Block copolymers based on cellulose esters have been reported. See, eg, Oliveira et al, Polymer, 35, 9, 1994; Feger et al, Polymer Bulletin, 3,407, 1980; Feger et al,Ibid, 6, 321, 1982; U.S. Patent No. 3,386,232; Steinmann , Polym. Preprint, Am. Chem.Soc. Div. Polym. Chem. 1970, 11, 285; Kim et al, J.Polym. Sci. Polym, Lett. Ed., 1973, 11, 731; and Kim et al. J Macromol. Sci., Chem (A) 1976, 10, 671. A major problem with these references is the generation of considerable chain branching, grafting or crosslinking. Mezger et al, Angew. Makromol Chem., 116,13,1983 prepared oligomeric, monohydroxy-terminated cellulose coupled with 4,-4'-diphenyldisocyanate, which was then used as a UV-macro-photo-initiator to prepare triblock copolymers. The reaction is known as the iniferter technique<br><br><br>
and uses UV initiation, which limits its applicability to certain processing methods.  Furthermore, it is typically applicable to styrenic and methacrylic monomers. Other monomers, such as acrylics, vinyl acetate, acrylamide type monomers, which are in widespread use in waterborne systems, might require another technique.<br>
So-called "living" radical polymerisation techniques are known which can give better defined polymers in terms of molecular structure.  Three approaches to preparation of controlled polymers in a "living" radical process have been described (Greszta et al, Macromolecules, 27, 638 (19'94) . The first approach involves the situation where growing radicals react reversibly with scavenging radicals to form covalent species.  The second approach involves the situation where growing radicals react reversibly with covalent species to produce persistent radicals.  The third approach involves the situation where reaction which regenerates the same type of radicals.  However, none of these techniques have been successfully applied to polysaccharide substrates.<br>
It has previously been recognised in the art that cellulose<br>
based materials adhere to cotton fibres. For example,<br>
WO 00/18861A and WO 00/18862A (Unilever) disclose cellulosic<br>
compounds having a benefit agent attached, so that the<br>
benefit agent will be attached to the fibre. See also<br>
WO 99/14925A (Procter &amp; Gamble).  However, the ability of<br>
polysaccharide, especially cellulose based materials to<br>
adhere has not been fully investigated, and a need exists to<br>
5<br><br>
find polysaccharide based materials that are of commercial significance.<br>
There is therefore a strong need to develop a process that makes it possible to prepare grafted materials from polysaccharide polymers, with a predictable number of graft chains per polysaccharide backbone.  These graft chains should be controlled in length and chemical composition. Moreover, the method of synthesis should be capable of commercial application.  In addition, a need exists to provide polysaccharide-based polymers which provide benefits to fibres and surfaces.<br>

That is, the phrase "substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl" is to be interpreted as "substituted alkyl, substituted alkenyl and substituted alkynyl". Similarly, "optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl" is to be interpreted as "optionally.substituted alkyl, optionally-substituted alkenyl and optionally substituted alkynyl."<br>
When any of the foregoing substituents are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any one or more of those customarily employed in the development of laundry treatment compounds and/or the modification of such compounds to influence their structure/activity, stability or other property.  Specific examples of such substituents include, for example, halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, cycloalkyl, alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyloxy, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, formyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, alkanoyl, alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, alkylsulphonato, carbamoyl and alkylamido groups.

which contains a halo moiety, such as a haloalkyl group, may thus contain any one or more of these halogen atoms.<br>
The term "amino" is used herein to refer to the group -NZIZ2 where each of Z1 and Z2 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrido and optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl and heterocyclic.<br>
The term "thio" is used herein to refer to the group -SZ1, where Z1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrido and optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl and heterocyclic.<br>

27<br><br><br>
wherein each R8 is independently selected from C1-20 (preferably C1-6) alkyl, C2-2o (preferably C2-6) alkenyl (eg vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (eg phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C1-4 alkyl, C1-12 (preferably C1-4) alkoxy, hydroxyl, vinyl and phenyl groups;<br>

alkenylene and C5-7 arylene (eg phenylene) groups, the carbon atoms in any of these being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C1-12 (preferably C1-4) alkoxy, vinyl, hydroxyl, halo and amine groups;<br>
each R  is independently selected from hydrogen, counter<br>
cations such as alkali metal (preferably Na) or 1/2 Ca or 1/2Mg,<br>
and groups R8 as hereinbefore defined;<br>
29<br><br>
R  is selected from C1-20 (preferably C1-6) alkyl, C2-2o (preferably C2-6) alkenyl (eg vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (eg<br>
phenyl), any of which is optionally substituted by one or<br>
more substituents independently selected from C1-4 alkyl, C1-12 (preferably C1-4) alkoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, cyano,<br>
sulphonato, vinyl and phenyl groups;<br>

groups R which together with the oxygen atom forming the linkage to the respective saccharide ring forms an ester or hemi-ester group of a tricarboxylic- or higher polycarboxylic- or other complex acid such as citric acid, an amino acid, a synthetic amino acid analogue or a protein;<br>
any remaining R groups being selected from hydrogen and ether substituents.<br>
It is particularly preferred that R12 is a methyl, ethyl, phenyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, carboxymethyl, sulphoethyl or cyanoethyl group.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as already mentioned, in formula (II) , some of the R groups may optionally have one or more structures, for example as hereinbefore described.  For example, one or more R groups may simply be hydrogen or an alkyl group.<br>
Preferred groups may for example be independently selected from one or more of acetate, propanoate, trifluoroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate cinnamate, formate,<br>
30<br><br>

Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate, hemisuccinate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate. The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of about 1 or less on a cellulose or other  -1,4 polysaccharide backbone. Thus, "cellulose monoacetate" refers to a molecule that has acetate esters in a degree of substitution of about 1.1 or less, preferably about 1.1 to about 0.5.  "Cellulose triacetate" refers to a molecule that has acetate esters in a degree of substitution of about 2.7 to 3.<br>
Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30°C and in any case below 50°C.  When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160). Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate. Glycollic and lactic ester are most common.<br>
Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose chloracetate (as described in GB 32 0 842) by treating 100 parts with 32 parts of NaOH in alcohol added in small portions.<br>
An alternative method of preparing cellulose es.ers consists in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher<br>
31<br><br>
ionisation constant (FR-A-702 116).  The ester is heated at about 100°C with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester.  By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate.  A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also. As an example cellulose acetate (10 g.) in dioxan (75 ml.) containing oxalic acid (10 g.) is heated at 100°C for 2 hours under reflux.<br>
Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, eg the acetate, is dissolved in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid (1.82 x 10-5) .  With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used.  If a mixed cellulose ester is treated with an acid this should have an ionisation constant greater than that of either of-the acids already in combination.<br>
A cellulose acetate-lactate-pyruvate is prepared from cellulose acetate, 40 per cent, acetyl (100 g.), in a bath of 125 ml. pyruvic acid and 125 ml. of 85 per cent. lactic acid by heating at 100°C for 18 hours.  The product is soluble in water and is precipitated and washed with ether-acetone.  M.p. 230-250°C.<br>
In the case when solubilising groups are attached to the polysaccharide, this is typically via covalent bonding and, may be pendant upon the backbone or incorporated therein.<br>
32<br><br>
The type of solubilising group may alter according to where the group is positioned with respect to the backbone.<br>
The molecular weight of the substituted polysaccharide part may typically be in the range of 1000 to 2 000 000, for example 10 000 to 1 500 000.<br>
Other substituents<br>
As well as the groups of formula -W- (X)p- (L)q-(Y)r-Z, pendant groups of other types may optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not confer a benefit and/or which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance substrate affinity.  Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the material (eg groups which are, or contain one or more free carboxylic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy- and/or (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
The other pendant groups preferably comprise from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 10% of the total number of pendant groups.  The water-solubilising groups could comprise from 0% to 100% of those other groups but preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, still more preferably from 0% to 5% of the total number of other pendant groups.<br>

Preferably, the reaction is carried out over a period of 12 to 24 hours, more preferably, 14 to 18 hours.

Additional suitable ligands include, for example, ethylenediamine and propylenediamine, both of which may be substituted from one to four times on the amino nitrogen atom with a C1-4 alkyl group or a carboxymethyl group; aminoethanol and aminopropanol, both of which may be<br>
42<br><br>
substituted from one to three times on the oxygen and/or nitrogen atom with a C1-4 alkyl group; ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, both of which may be substituted one or two times on the oxygen atoms with a C1-4 alkyl group; diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, etc.<br>
Suitable carbon-based ligands include arenes (as described above for the "aryl" group) and the cyclopentadienyl ligand. Preferred carbon-based ligands include benzene (which may be substituted with from one to six C1-4 alkyl groups &gt;eg, methyl!) and cyclopentadienyl (which may be substituted with from one to five methyl groups, or which may be linked through an ethylene or propylene chain to a second cyclopentadienyl ligand).  Where the cyclopentadienyl ligand is used, it may not be necessary to include a counteranion (N) in the transition metal compound.<br>
Preferred ligands include unsubstituted and substituted pyridines and bipyridines, acetonitrile, (R30O)3 P, PR303/1,10-phenanthroline, porphyrin, cryptands such as K222 and crown ethers such as 18-crown-6. The most preferred ligands are bipyridine and (R30O) 3 P where R30 is C1-20 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more halogen (preferably fluorine or chlorine atoms, C2-20 alkenyl (preferably vinyl) , C2-10 alkynyl (preferably acetylenyl) , phenyl optionally substituted by one or more halogen or C2-4 alkyl groups or phenyl C1-6 alkyl.<br>
In the present polymerisation, the amounts and relative proportions of initiator, transition metal compound and ligand are those effective to conduct this type of<br>
43<br><br>
polymerisation which is known as atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP). Initiator efficiencies with the present initiator/transition metal compound/1igand system are generally very good (at least 50%, preferably a 80%, more preferably  90%). Accordingly, the amount of initiator can be selected such that the initiator concentration is from 104 M to 1M, preferably 10"3 -10"1 M. Alternatively, the initiator can be present in a molar ratio of from 10-4 :1 to 10"1 :1, preferably from 10-3 :1 to 5 x 10-2 :1, relative to monomer.<br>
An initiator concentration of 0.1-1M is particularly useful for preparing end-functional polymers.<br>
The molar proportion of transition metal compound relative to initiator is generally that which is effective to polymerize the selected monomer(s), but may be from 0.0001:1 to 10:1, preferably from 0.1:1 to 5:1, more preferably from 0.3:1 to 2:1, and most preferably from 0.9:1 to 1.1:1. Conducting the polymerisation in a homogeneous system may permit reducing the concentration of transition metal and ligand such that the molar proportion of transition metal compound to initiator is as low as 0.001:1.<br>
Similarly, the molar proportion of ligand relative to transition metal compound is generally that which is effective to polymerize the selected monomer(s), but can depend upon the number of coordination sites on the transition metal compound which the selected ligand will occupy. (One of ordinary skill understands the number of coordination sites on a given transition metal compound<br><br><br>
which a selected ligand will occupy.) The amount of ligand may be selected such that the ratio of (a) coordination , sites on  the transition metal compound to (b) coordination sites which the ligand will occupy is from 0.1:1 to 100:1, preferably from 0.2:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 0.5:1 to 3:1, and most preferably from 0.8:1 to 2:1. However, as is also known in the art, it is possible for a solvent or for a monomer to act as a ligand. For the purposes of this application, a monomer is treated as being (a) distinct from and (b) not included within the scope of the ligand.<br>
The present polymerisation may be conducted in the absence of solvent ("bulk" polymerisation) . However, when a solvent is used, the reaction can be carried out as a suspension or a solution.  Suitable solvents include water, ethers, cyclic ethers, C5-10 alkanes, C5-8 cycloalkanes which may be substituted with from 1 to 3 C1-4 alkyl groups, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, DMSO, DMA.C, mixtures of such solvents, and supercritical solvents (such as CO2, C1-4 alkanes in which any H may be replaced with F, etc.) . Aprotic polar solvents are especially preferred. The present polymerisation may also be conducted in accordance with known suspension, emulsion and precipitation polymerisation processes.<br>
Suitable ethers include compounds of the formula R31 OR32, in which each of R31 and R32 is independently an alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms which may be further substituted with a C1-4 -alkoxy group. Preferably, when one of R31 and R32 is methyl, the other of R31 and R32 is alkyl of from 4 to 6<br>
45<br><br>
carbon atoms or C1-4 -alkoxyethyl. Examples include diethyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, dipropyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, di-t-butyl ether, glyme (dimethoxyethane) diglyme (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether), etc.<br>
Suitable cyclic ethers include THF and dioxane. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbon solvents include benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene and any isomer or mixture of isomers of cumene. Suitable halogenated hydrocarbon solvents include CH2C12/ 1,2-dichloroethane and benzene substituted from 1 to 6 times with fluorine and/or chlorine, although one should ensure that the selected halogenated hydrocarbon solvent(s) does not act as an initiator under the reaction conditions.<br>
Keys to controlling the polymerisation reaction may include (1) matching the reactivity of the groups in the initiator with the group (s) on the monomer (R13-R16) , and (2) matching the energetics of bond breaking and bond forming in dormant species (eg, dormant polymer chains) and transition metal species (as discussed elsewhere in the specification). Matching the reactivities of the initiator with the monomer depends to some degree on the radical stabilizing effects of the substituents.Thus, where the monomer is a simple alkene or halogenated alkene (eg, ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, etc.), one may select an alkyl halide initiator. On the other hand, if one wishes to polymerise an arena- or ester-stabilized monomer (eg, a (meth) acrylate, acrylonitrile or styrene), one may select an initiator which is stabilized by a similar group (ie. it contains an aryl, heterocyclyl, alkoxycarbonyl, CN, carboxyamido group, etc.).<br>
'46<br><br>
Such "matching" of substituents on the initiator and monomer provides a beneficial balance of the relative reactivities of the initiator and monomer.<br>
Preferably, the monomer, initiator, transition metal compound and ligand are selected such that the rate of initiation is not less than 1000 times (preferably not less than 100 times) slower than the rate of propagation and/or transfer of the X group to the polymer radical. (In the present application, "propagation" refers to the reaction of a polymer radical with a monomer to form a polymer-monomer adduct radicals.)<br>
The present polymerisation may be conducted in bulk, in the gas phase (eg, by passing the monomer in the gas phase over a bed of the catalyst which has been previously contacted with the initiator and ligand), in a sealed vessel or in an autoclave. Polymerising may be conducted at a temperature of from -78° to 200°, preferably from 0° to 160° and most preferably from 10° to 80°. The reaction should be conducted for a length of time sufficient to convert at least 10% (preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 75% and most preferably at least 90%) of the monomer to polymer. Typically, the reaction time will be from several minutes to 5 days, preferably from 30 minutes to 3 days, and most preferably from 1 to 24 hours. Polymerising may be conducted at a pressure of from 0.1 to 100 atmospheres, preferably from 1 to 50 atmospheres and most preferably from 1 to 10 atmospheres (although the pressure may not be measurable directly if conducted in a sealed vessel).<br>
47<br><br>
One may also conduct a "reverse" ATRP, in which the transition metal compound is in its oxidized state, and the polymerisation is initiated by, for example, a radical initiator such as azobis(isobutyronitrile) ("AIBN"), a peroxide such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or a peroxy acid such as peroxyacetic acid or peroxybenzoic acid.<br>
After the polymerising step is complete, the formed polymer is isolated. The isolating step of the present process is conducted by known procedures, and may comprise precipitating in a suitable solvent, filtering the precipitated polymer, washing the polymer and drying the polymer.<br>
Precipitation can be typically conducted using a suitable C5-8 -alkane or C5-8-cycloalkane solvent, such as pentane hexane, heptane, cyclohexane or mineral spirits, or using a C1-6 alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or any mixture of suitable solvents. Preferably, the solvent for precipitating is hexane, mixtures of hexanes, or methanol.<br>
The precipitated (co)polymer can be filtered by gravity or by vacuum filtration, in accordance with known methods (eg using a Buchner funnel and an aspirator). The polymer can then be washed with the solvent used to precipitate the polymer, if desired. The steps of precipitating, filtering and washing may be repeated, as desired.<br>
Once isolated, the (co)polymer may be dried by drawing air through the (co)polymer, by vacuum, etc., in accordance with known methods (preferably by vacuum) . The present<br>
48<br><br>
(co)polymer may be analyzed and/or characterized by size exclusion chromatography, in accordance with known procedures.<br>
The (co)polymers of the present invention may have a number average molecular weight of from 1000 to 500 000 g/mol, preferably of from 2000 to 250 000 g/mol, and more preferably of from 3000 to 200 000 g/mol. When produced in bulk, the number average molecular weight may be up to 1 000 000 (with the same minimum weights as mentioned above). The number average molecular weight may be determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or, when the initiator has a group which can be easily distinguished from the monomer(s) by NMR spectroscopy<br>
Thus, the present invention also encompasses novel block, multi-block, star, gradient, random hyperbranched and dendritic copolymers, as well as graft or "comb" copolymers. Each of the these different types of copolymers will be described hereunder.<br>
Because ATRP is a "living" polymerisation, it can be started and stopped, practically at will. Further, the polymer product retains the functional group "X" necessary to initiate a further polymerisation. Thus, in one embodiment, once the first monomer is consumed in the initial polymerising step, a second monomer can then be added to form a second block on the growing polymer chain in a second polymerising step. Additional polymerisations with the same or different monomer(s) can be performed to prepare multi-block copolymers.<br>
49<br><br>
Furthermore, since ATRP is a radical polymerisation, blocks can be prepared in essentially any order. One is not necessarily limited to preparing block copolymers where the sequential polymerising steps must flow from the least stabilized polymer intermediate to the most stabilized polymer intermediate, such as is necessary in ionic polymerisation. (However, as is described throughout the application, certain advantageous reaction design choices will become apparent. However, one is not limited to those advantageous reaction design choices in the present invention.) Thus, one can prepare a multi-block copolymer in which a polyacrylonitrile or a poly (meth) acrylate block is prepared first, then a styrene or butadiene block is attached thereto, etc.<br>
Furthermore, a linking group is not necessary to join the different blocks of the present block copolymer. One can simply add successive monomers to form successive blocks. Further, it is also possible (and in some cases advantageous) to first isolate a (co)polymer produced by the present ATRP process, then react the polymer with an additional monomer using a different initiator/catalyst system (to "match" the reactivity of the growing polymer chain with the new monomer). In such a case, the product polymer acts as the new initiator for the further polymerisation of the additional monomer. Thus, the present invention also encompasses block copolymers. Preferably the number average molecular weight of each block is from 1000 to 250 000 g/mol.<br>
50<br><br>
The present invention is also useful for making essentially-random copolymers. By "essentially random" copolymers, the copolymers are as close to statistically random as is possible under radical polymerisation conditions. The present ATRP process is particularly useful for producing random copolymers where one of the monomers has one or two bulky substituents (eg, 1,1-diarylethylene, didehydromalonate C1-20 diesters, C1-20  diesters of maleic or fumaric acid, maleic anhydride and/or maleic diimides from which homopolymers may be difficult to prepare, due to steric considerations. Preferably, the number average molecular weight of the copolymer is from 1000 to 1 000 000 g/mol. The ratio of (1) the total number of "blocks" of statistically random units to (2) the total number of monomer units is preferably at least 1:5, more preferably at least 1:8, and most preferably at least 1:10. The present random copolymer can also serve as a block in any of the present block copolymers.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the monomers has the formula:<br><br>
wherein at least one of R13 and R14 is CN, CF3, straight or branched alkyl of from 4 to 20 carbon atoms (preferably from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms), C3-8 cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, C(=T)R17,<br>
51<br><br>
C(=T)NR18R19 and TC(=T)R20, where aryl, heterocyclyl, T, R , R18, R19 and R20 are as defined above; and<br>
R15 and R16 are as defined above; or<br>
R13 and R15 are joined to form a group of the formula C(=0)-T-C(=0), where T is as defined above.<br>
More preferred monomers for the present (co)polymer include styrene, acrylonitrile, C1-8 esters of (meth) acrylic acid and 1,1-diphenylethylene and derivatives thereof, especially sodium methacrylate, t-butylaminoethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethylmorpholine methacrylate,<br>
2-methacryloxyethylglucoside, methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate, glycerol monomethacrylate, 2-(sulphooxy)ethyl methacrylate ammonium salt, 3-sulphopropyl methacrylate potassium salt, [2-(methacryloxy) ethyl] dimethyl -(3-sulphopropyl)ammonium hydroxide inner salt, 4-vinyl benzoic acid and 4-styrenesulphonic acid sodium salt.<br>
The present invention is also useful for forming so-called "star" polymers and copolymers.<br>
In the present copolymers, each of the blocks may have a number average molecular weight in accordance with the homopolymers described above. Thus, the present copolymers may have a molecular weight which corresponds to the number of blocks (or in the case of star polymers, the number of<br>
52<br><br>
branches times the number of blocks)  times the number average molecular weight range for each block.<br>
The present invention also encompasses graft or "comb" copolymers, prepared by sequential ATRPs. Thus, a (co)polymer is produced by a first ATRP, in which at least one of the monomers has a halogen substituent. Preferably, this substituent is Cl or Br. Examples of preferred monomers would thus include vinyl chloride, 1- or 2- chloropropene, vinyl bromide, 1,1- or 1,2-dichloro- or dibromoethene, trichloro- or tribromoethylene, tetrachloro- or tetrabromoethylene, chloroprene, 1-chlorobutadiene, 1- or 2-bromodutadiene, etc.More preferred monomers conclude vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide and chloroprene. It may be necessary to hydrogenate (by known methods) a (co)polymer produced in the first ATRP of chloroprene prior to the second ATRP, using the polymer produced by the first ATRP as the initiator.<br>
Gradient or tapered copolymers can be produced using ATRP by controlling the proportion of two or more monomers being added. For example, one can prepare a first block or a oligomer) of a first monomer, then, a mixture of the first monomer and a second, distinct monomer can be added in proportions of from, for example, 1:1 to 9:1 of first monomer to second monomer. After conversion of all monomer(s) is complete, sequential additions of first monomer-second monomers mixtures can provide subsequent "blocks" in which the proportions of first monomer to second monomer vary.<br>
53<br><br>
Preferably, the proportions of first and second monomers in subsequent "blocks" vary by at least 10%, preferably by at least 20%, up to 50%, from the preceding block. In a further embodiment, the relative proportions of first monomer to second monomer can be controlled in a continuous manner, using for example a programmable syringe or feedstock supply pump.<br>
When either the initiator or monomer contains a substituent bearing a remote (ie unconjugated) ethylene or acetylene moiety, ATRP can be used to prepare cross-linked polymers and copolymers.<br>
Polymers and copolymers produced by the present process have surprisingly low polydispersity for (co)polymers produced by radical polymerization. Typically, the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight "Mw /Mn ") is s 1,5, preferably si.4, and can be as low as 1.10 or less.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples:<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of controlled cellulose monoacatate (CMA)-graft-copolymers by atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP).<br>
(i)  Preparation of CMA based ATRP macroinitiator<br>
Method A: Under an atmosphere of nitrogen, 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (5.98 g, 26 mmol) was added to a pre-cooled (0°C) solution of 2-bromoisobutyric acid (4.34 g, 26 mmol) in a mixture of dry pyridine (5 mL) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (5 mL) .  Upon mixing, a yellow colour developed and precipitation was observed.  The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes to allow complete formation of 2-bromoisobutyric anhydride) then added, in one lot, to a rapidly stirred solution of cellulose monoacetate (10.00 g, DS 0.7, 51.4 mmol anhydroglucose unit) in N,N-dimethylacetamide (50 mL) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.10 g, 0.8 mmol).  The resulting pale yellow solution was stirred for 16 hours overnight then the viscous reaction mixture was then poured very slowly into vigorously stirred methanol (600 mL) and the resulting precipitate filtered off (however, if this was too fine it was isolated by centrifugation).  The solids were slurried in methanol (500 mL) and<br>
refiltered/centrifuged;  this process being carried out two times.  Following the second wash cycle the material was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40°C.  This gave 5.53 g of the macroinitiator as a white powder.<br>
1H NMR (20% DC1 in D2O) δH/ppm:  1.9 (0.22H, s, C[CH3]2); 2.1 (6.12H, s, CH3CO); 3.1-3.9 (12H, m, glucose CH's and CH2); 4.7<br><br><br>
and 5.3 (2H, d, anomeric H's).  Thus the NMR showed that the DS of the initiator group was 0.04.<br>
Method B:  Cellulose monoacetate (10.0 0 g, DS 0.7, 51.4 mmol anhydroglucose unit) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide<br>
(55 mL) by rapid stirring and heating to 80°C.  This solution was allowed to cool to room temperature then dry pyridine (5 mL) was added.  2-Bromoisobutyryl bromide was added slowly to this stirred homogeneous mixture during 15 minutes whilst a blanket of nitrogen was maintained over the reaction flask.  The cloudy mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours overnight.  The viscous reaction mixture was then poured very slowly into vigorously stirred methanol (600 ml) and the resulting precipitate filtered off<br>
(however,  if this was too fine it was isolated by centrifugation) .  The solids were slurried in methanol (500 mL) and refiltered/centrifuged;  this process being repeated two times.  Following the second wash cycle the material was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40°C.  This gave 6.86 g of the macroinitiator as a white powder.  The NMR showed (as before) that the DS of the initiator group was 0.04.<br>
(ii) Preparation of CMA-graft-poly(styrene-4-sulphonic acid sodium salt)<br>
To a three-neck round bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet (via a closeable tap) was added a solution (heating was required to achieve full dissolution) of styrene 4-sulphonic acid sodium salt (2.062g, 10.0 mmol) in<br>
56<br><br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide (20 mL) .  A vigorous stream of nitrogen was passed through this solution in order to remove any dissolved oxygen.  N-(n-Pentyl)-2-pyridylmethanimine (0.066 g, 0.4 mmol) and a solution of the<br>
CMA./bromoisobutyrate initiator (DSinitiator=0.04; 0.857 g, 2.3 mmol, so 0.2 mmol Br sites) in N,N-dimethylacetamide (5 mL) were added and the degassing continued.  Copper(1)bromide (0.029 g, 0.2 mmol) was added and the mixture degassed for a further 10 minutes before being sealed under nitrogen.   The brown coloured reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 80°C for 16 hours, allowed to cool, then transferred to a single neck flask.  The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid residue dissolved in demineralised water (70 mL) .  The green coloured aqueous solution was filtered through a short column (45 x 35 mm, W x H) of silica gel (60H) so as to remove the copper.  The pale yellow filtrate was frozen (using dry ice) then lyophilised to give 2.12 g of the grafted polysaccharide as a soft white flaky solid.<br>

Preparation of Locust Bean Gum-graft-copolymers<br>
(i) Preparation of Locust Bean Gum macroinitiator<br>
A 9% w/v solution of lithium chloride (LiCl) in N,N-dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was prepared by heating 9g of LiCl in 100cm3 of anhydrous DMSO to 150°C in a 2-necked round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer.  Once a homogeneous solution had been obtained, Locust Bean Gum (LBG, MUD 246B ex Rhodia) (5g, 0.031 mol of anhydromannose/galactose unit) was added to the solution gradually, maintaining the temperature at 150°C until a highly viscous, clear, yellow solution had formed.  This solution was then cooled to 65°C.<br>
In a separate beaker, a solution of 2-bromoisobutyric acid (10.33g, 0.062 mol) in anhydrous DMSO (50cm3) was prepared. To this solution, 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (10g, 0.00617 mol) was added slowly.  Once the evolution of CO2 had ceased, this solution was added to the LBG/DMSO/LiCl solution with stirring.  The reaction mixture was maintained at 65°C for 24 hours.  It was then poured into a 3-fold volume of methanol, causing the product to precipitate. This was collected on a sinter funnel, then re-dispersed into methanol, filtered and washed with copious amounts of methanol.  The product was dried under vacuo at 60°C for 48 hours, yielding 3.5g of a creamy, crystalline solid.<br>

From the NMR, the degree of substitution (DS) of ester group per repeat unit of Locust Bean Gum is 0.83.<br>
(ii) Preparation of Locust Bean Gum-graft-poly(methacrylic acid)<br>
To a 3-necked round bottom flask fitted with an N2 inlet, thermometer and suba seal fitted with a syringe needle were added Locust Bean Gum - macroinitiator (lg, 9.294xl0-4 mol), sodium methacrylate (5.02g, 0.04647 mol) and a magnetic stirrer bar.  The solids were dissolved in demineralised water (15 cm3) and the resulting solution de-gassed by bubbling nitrogen gas through for 45 minutes.  A mixture of copper (I) bromide (0.1333g, 9.294 x 10-4 mol) and 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.2937g, 1.859xl0-3 mol) was added to the reaction flask.  A polymerisation exotherm of 10°C was noted.  The reaction was stirred for 2 hours at ambient temperature. The contents of the flask was then diluted with demineralised water and the solution passed through a slurry of silica on a sinter funnel, yielding a water-white, clear solution.  This was added to a 3-fold volume of methanol, causing the product to precipitate.  This was collected on a filter and dried in vacuo at 40°C to constant weight, yielding 2.8 g of white, crystalline powder.<br>
