INDIA<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Frit and a method for manufacturing the same. More particularly, it relates to a Frit for use in Refractory coating. The invention also relates to a coating for carbon-containing refractory article comprising of the said frit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditionally, refractory articles which are used in iron and steel industry for continuous casting of molten steel in steel plants are made of alumina, magnesia, alumino-silicate, silicon carbide, chrome, zirconia, silica etc. Carbon is often incorporated along with these refractory articles especially in its components like submerged entry nozzle (SEN), slide gate plates, submerged entry shroud to protect the refractory articles from attack and erosion by molten metal and slag. Carbon is used in the form of graphite, carbon black, pitch coke and the like. Alumina-carbon refractories are quite popular for continuous casting of molten steel in steel plants.<br>
However the carbon is susceptible to oxidation by air at temperature above 600 degree centigrade, which can deteriorate the properties of refractory during preheat and casting operation. Hence carbon must be protected so that properties of refractory do not get deteriorated during preheating at the temperature of 1400 to 1450 degree centigrade and/or casting at about 1550 to 1600 degree centigrade during the casting time which varies between 5-7 hours.<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Frit is generally used for coating non-refractory articles. Such frit has high softening point generally above 850 degree centigrade and therefore cannot be used for coating refractory articles.<br>
Coatings for refractory articles are not known to contain frit. Coating for refractory articles known in the prior art contain refractory filler, fluxing/fusing material and metalloid.<br>
EP - A - 0252621 discloses a coating mass comprising of refractory filler - 35 to 70 % w/w, fluxing/fusible material (Boron compound or Boron Glass) - 20 to 40% w/w, metalloid (aluminum and silicon) - 10 to 25% w/w.<br>
However, the use of fusible material in higher dosage i.e. 20 - 40 % w/w as stated above may increase the fluidity of the coating mass and same may cause the flow down of the coating mass. Boron based compound normally softens at low temperature (292 degree centigrade) whereas the refractory article has the ability to withstand the temperature of 1650 to 1700 degree centigrade. More use of low temperature fluxing material after reaction with the refractory article brings down the refractoriness of the refractory article and because of this refractory article will soften at lower temperature during use and same will cause reduction in the service life.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,856,015 describes a coating mass to be used with liquid carrier comprising of Silica- 40 to 80% w/w, fluxing material (Boron Oxide) - 5 to 20% w/w, oxide of alumina/calcia/magnesia - 5 to 20% w/w, Metal oxide of arsenic/antimony/bismuth/lead/ vanadium /tin (wetting aid) - 0.5 to 10% w/w, Metalloids - 30% w/w wherein particle size is 1 to 250 microns and preferably 10 to 50 microns.<br><br>
In the above coating mass, a high temperature wetting aid is used. These wetting aids have the following limitations:-<br>
a)	Most of the metal oxides mentioned are toxic in nature. Use of the same is banned in most of the countries. These types of oxides in raw form are more dangerous to handle.<br>
b)	Softening/melting temperature of these oxides (wetting aids) are relatively high. Melting point of these compounds is Lead oxide - 888 degree centigrade, Vanadium oxide - 690 degree centigrade, Bismuth oxide - 820 to 860 degree centigrade, Tin oxide - 1127 degree centigrade ( decomposition temp), Antimony oxide - 656 degree centigrade, Arsenic oxide - 193 degree centigrade (it sublimes). As the carbon oxidation starts at about 600 degree centigrade, coating mass needs to melt at temperature near to 600 degree centigrade. Boron based compounds of these coating masses though melt at low temperature, use of those toxic compounds does not satisfy the softening temperature requirement fully.<br>
c)	The particle size distribution is in broader range i.e. 1 - 250 microns (preferably 10-50 microns). This wide variation (more coarse) in particle sizes reduces the surface area which does not favor good sintering and increases the chance of segregation i.e. unsatisfactory dispersion and texture.<br>
d)	Use of raw boron salts cause the removal of chemically combined water. During the removal, pinholes may develop on the coating.<br>
In case of both the above coating mass, the fusible/fluxing mass is used in raw form i.e. unfritted form. In case of application with liquid carrier, the alkali component of the<br><br>
fluxing material gets leached out to some extent and reacts with the carrier to cause precipitation. As a result, proper painting/brushing/spraying cannot be done. Further, in both dry and liquid type, due to presence of higher percentages of fluxing material in raw form, coating mass after application may get spalled due to brittleness of glassy material and the coating comes out by cracking.<br>
Use of Borosilicate glass instead of raw boron compound has also been reported. It has also got following limitations,<br>
a)	It melts at about 820 degree centigrade which is relatively higher for application in coating mass. Percentages of low boron compound possibly raises the melting point.<br>
b)	Absence of alumina raises the temperature of melting possibly due to devitrification.<br>
c)	It has higher coefficient of expansion (8 x 10-6 per degree centigrade at 350 degree centigrade) which can deteriorate the spalling resistance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention therefore proposes a frit for refractory coating having low softening point at around 680 degree centigrade and a method of manufacturing the same. It also proposes, a coating comprising of the said frit. The said coating may be either in dry form or dry powder with liquid carrier.<br><br>

after proportioning is mixed in ribbon mixer for 1-2 hours, and fed in batch type smelter for firing at 1000 to 1500 degree centigrade for 10 - 15 minutes. The temperature of firing is optimized to obtain highest density and minimum coefficient of expansion. This produces a Frit having the following properties:-<br><br>

ADVANTAGES<br>
1.0 The frit has been developed by encapsulating the various oxides/ non-oxide materials through melting so that the pinhole/other defects which are commonly encountered in case of unfritted boron compound due to removal of chemically combined water, can be avoided. This developed mass is in fritted form and superior to raw boron based compounds.<br>
2.0 The frit has been made without use of any toxic materials which are having higher softening point as compared to boron oxide of alkali metals. Non use of these toxic materials make the mass user friendly.<br>
3.0 The frit is made with the use of alumina to ensure proper vitrification so that proper   glassy material can be made at lower temperature. This helps softening of the<br><br>
coating at lower temperature i.e. about 680 degree centigrade as against more than 800 degree centigrade in case of borosilicate glass.<br>
4.0 The thermal expansion coefficient of frit is kept at lower side i.e. between 5.1 X 10 -6 to 6.2 X 10 -6 / degree centigrade thereby it avoids spalling and cracking during heating and cooling of the article. It helps to generate less stress and thus eliminate the breakage of coating during use and ensure better adhesion.<br>
5.0 Frit composition has a flexibility to make it suitable for refractories which are subjected to higher temperature.<br>
6.0 Particle size D50(median)( range 10-30 micron) is kept at narrow range of 10-15 micron for better dispersion, more surface area which helps in better sintering and uniform texture. It helps in better coating of the refractory and also penetration in the micro pores present in the refractory body to arrest infiltration of air which reduces the oxidation of the carbon in the refractory article.<br>
7.0. The frit in the refractory glaze is major component of the coating mass which stops/inhibit oxidation of carbon present in the alumina - carbon and other carbon incorporated refractory articles.<br>
8.0. Frit due to water quenching develops lot of cracks and hence it is easy to grind to very fine size (10 -30 micron). This being a component of coating mass contributes in better wetting of the refractory articles.<br>
9.0. The coating according to the present invention contains less percentage of Boron compound in the form of frit, which improves the life of refractory article coated with the said coating.<br><br>
