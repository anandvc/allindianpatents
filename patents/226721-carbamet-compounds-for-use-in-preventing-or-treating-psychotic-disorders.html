Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims benefit of provisional application Serial Number<br>
60/271,889, filed 27 February 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a method for use of a carbamate compound<br>
in preventing or treating psychotic disorders. More particularly, this invention is<br>
directed to a method for use of halogenated 2-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol<br>
monocarbamate or dicarbamate compounds for preventing or treating<br>
psychotic disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Psychotic disorders are those that are predominantly characterized by<br>
psychosis. Psychosis is an impairment of mental functioning to the extent that<br>
it interferes grossly with an individual's ability to meet the ordinary demands of<br>
life. According to the American Psychiatric Association, psychotic means<br>
grossly impaired, in terms of reality testing. Such testing would define gross<br>
impairment as existing when individuals incorrectly evaluate the accuracy of<br>
their perceptions and thoughts and make incorrect inferences about external<br>
reality, even in the face of contrary evidence. The term psychotic is also<br>
appropriate when behavior is so disorganized that it is reasonable to infer that<br>
results of reality testing would indicate an individual as grossly disturbed, for<br>
instance, by the existence of markedly incoherent speech without apparent<br>
awareness by the person that the speech is not understandable or by the<br>
agitated, inattentive and disoriented behavior observed in the phencyclidine<br>
psychotic disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Ed.<br>
4th, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC 1994; Kaplan &amp;<br>
Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, Seventh Edition, Volume I,<br>
Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins: Philadelphia, pp. 825, 2000).<br>
Psychotic disorders include, and are not limited to, schizophrenia,<br>
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief<br>
psychotic disorder, shared psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a<br>
general medical condition, substance-induced psychotic disorder or psychotic<br>
disorder not otherwise specified (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br>
Disorders, Ed. 4th, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC 1994).<br>
Schizophrenia is any of a group of psychotic disorders usually<br>
characterized by withdrawal from reality, illogical patterns of thinking, delusions<br>
and hallucinations and accompanied in varying degrees by other emotional,<br>
behavioral or intellectual disturbances (Schizophrenia, Decision Resources,<br>
Inc., December 2000). A lifelong chronic mental illness, schizophrenia exhibits<br>
several features including positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits,<br>
onset in young adulthood and deterioration from the previous level ot<br>
functioning. Positive symptoms reflect a distortion or excess of normal<br>
functions (eg, disorganized speech, delusions, hallucinations). Negative<br>
symptoms, on the other hand, reflect a restricted range of normal behavior and<br>
emotions (eg, apathy, paucity of speech and incongruity or flattening of<br>
emotional responses). Schizophrenia can be presented in various forms<br>
depending on the symptoms and signs. The varieties of schizophrenia include<br>
paranoid schizophrenia, hebephrenic schizophrenia, catatonic schizophrenia,<br>
and undifferentiated schizophrenia as well as post-schizophrenic depression,<br>
residual schizophrenia, simple schizophrenia and unspecified schizophrenia.<br>
Increasingly, schizophrenia is conceptualized as a complex biological<br>
disorder in which genes play a role (but not an exclusive one) and in which<br>
brain development is likely to be abnormal. Multiple abnormalities have been<br>
implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including serotoninergic<br>
dysfunctions and abnormal dopminergic transmission which result in the<br>
impairment of sensormotor gating (Aghajanian GK, Marek GJ, Serotonin model<br>
of schizophrenia: emerging role of glutamate mechanisms, Brain Res. Rev.,<br>
2000, 31 (2-3), 302-12; Lieberman JA, Mailman RB, Duncan G, Sikich L,<br>

Compounds that have various activities, including exhibiting 5-HT2A<br>
receptor antagonism, are effective antipsychotics (Carlsson A, Waters N,<br>
Carlsson ML, Neurotransmitter interactions in schizophrenia-therapeutic<br>
implications, Biol. Psychiatry, 1999, 46 (10), 1388-95). For instance,<br>
antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone,<br>
sertindole, and ziprasidone are potent 5-HT2a receptor antagonists (Meltzer<br>
HY, The role of serotonin in antipsychotic drug action,<br>

DOl (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride) is<br>
an hallucinogen having high affinity and selectivity as an agonist at 5-HT2A/2C<br>
receptors (Dowd CS, Herrick-Davis K, Egan C, DuPre A, Smith C, Teitler M,<br>
Glennon RA, 1-[4-(3-Phenylalkyl)phenyl]-2-aminopropanes as 5-HT(2A) partial<br>
agonists, J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43 (16), 3074-84; Yan QS, Activation of 5-<br>
HT2A/2C receptors within the nucleus accumbens increases local<br>
dopaminergic transmission, Brain Res. Bull., 2000, 51 (1), 75-81; Wettstein JG,<br>
Host M, Hitchcock JM, Selectivity of action of typical and atypical anti-psychotic<br>
drugs as antagonists of the behavioral effects of 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-<br>
iodophenyi]-2-aminopropane (DOI), Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol.<br>
Psychiatry, 1999, 23 (3), 533-44). In the DOI-induced head shake animal<br>
model, DOI administration produces dose-related behavioral effects including<br>
head shakes. In a dose-dependent manner, antipsychotics such as<br>
risperidone, haloperidol, clozapine and olanzapine antagonize the behavioral<br>
effects of DOI. Overall, the data shows that antipsychotic agents as a drug<br>
class effectively block the effects of DOI with selective activity and that non-<br>
antipsychotic drugs were generally inactive (Wettstein JG, Host M, Hitchcock<br>
JM, Selectivity of action of typical and atypical anti-psychotic drugs as<br>
antagonists of the behavioral effects of 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-<br>
aminopropane (DOI), Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry, 1999<br>
Apr, 23 (3.), 533-44).<br>
The prepulse inhibition (PPI) animal model (wherein a reduced startle<br>
reflex occurs in dopamine-activated rodents when a startling stimulus is<br>
preceded 30 to 500 msec by a weak stimulus or prepulse) and is predictive of<br>
clinical antipsychotic potency in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients who have<br>
dopaminergic deficits (Vollenweider, Franz X. and Geyer, Mark A., A systems<br>
mode) of altered consciousness: integrating natural and drug-induced<br>
psychoses, Brain Research Bulletin, 2001, 56, 5, 495-507; Braff, D.L., Geyer,<br>

Because schizophrenia is a disease of rnultifaceted origin, the different<br>
animal models used to predict the efficacy of an antipsychotic drug may<br>
suggest that the drug has a specific mechanism of action (for example,<br>
affecting serotoninergic or dopaminergic transmission) in different patient<br>
populations.<br>
Substituted phenyl alkyl carbamate compounds have been described in<br>
US Patent No. 3,265,728 to Bossinger, et al (hereby incorporated by<br>

heterocyclic, ureido and hydrazino radicals and the radical -N(R3)2 wherein R3<br>
represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing less than 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Optically pure forms of halogen substituted 2-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol<br>
monocarbamates and dicarbamates have also been described in US Patent<br>
No. 6,103,759 to Choi, et al (hereby incorporated by reference), as effective for<br>
treating and preventing central nervous system disorders including<br>

Halogen substituted 2-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol carbamate compounds of<br>
Formula (I) or Formula (II) have not been previously described as useful for<br>
preventing or treating psychotic disorders. Recent preclinical studies have<br>
revealed previously unrecognized pharmacological properties which suggest<br>
that a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) is useful in preventing or<br>
treating psychotic disorders. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to teach a method for use of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) in<br>
preventing or treating psychotic disorders.<br>

administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
selected from the group consisting of Formula (I) and Formula (II) in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
and a compound selected from the group consisting of Formula (I) and<br>
Formula (II). The method of the present invention also includes the use of a<br>
compound selected from the group consisting of Formula (I) and Formula (II)<br>
for the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating psychotic<br>
disorders.<br>
Another example of the method of the present invention comprises<br>
administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
selected from the group consisting of Formula (I) and Formula (II) or a<br>
pharmaceutical composition thereof in combination with one or more agents<br>
useful in preventing or treating psychotic disorders.<br>
A compound selected from the group consisting of Formula (I) and<br>
Formula (II) or pharmaceutical composition thereof may be administered by<br>
any conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral,<br>
pulmonary, intraperitoneal (ip), intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im),<br>
subcutaneous (sc), transdermal, buccal, nasal, sublingual, ocular, rectal and<br>
vaginal. In addition, administration directly to the nervous system may include,<br>
and are not limited to, intracerebral, intraventricular, intracerebroventricular,<br>
intrathecal, intracisternal, intraspinal or peri-spinal routes of administration by<br>
delivery via intracranial or intravertebral needles or catheters with or without<br>
pump devices. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that any<br>
dose or frequency of administration that provides the therapeutic effect<br>
described herein is suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of a compound selected from the<br>
group consisting of Formula (I) and Formula (II) or pharmaceutical composition<br>
thereof may be from about 0.01 mg/Kg/dose to about 100 mg/Kg/dose.<br>
Preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.01<br>
mg/Kg/dose to about 25 mg/Kg/dose. More preferably, the therapeutically<br>
effective amount may be from about 0.01 mg/Kg/dose to about 10 mg/Kg/dose.<br>
Most preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.01<br>
mg/Kg/dose to about 5 mg/Kg/dose. Therefore, the therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the active ingredient contained per dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule,<br>
powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonfui and the like) as described herein<br>
may be from about 1 mg/day to about 7000 mg/day for a subject, for example,<br>
having an average weight of 70 Kg.<br>
The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement<br>
of the subjects (including factors associated with the particular subject being<br>
treated, including subject age, weight and diet, strength of the preparation, the<br>
advancement of the disease condition and the mode and time of<br>
administration) and the use of a particular compound of Formula (I) or Formula<br>
(II) or pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by<br>
those skilled in the art and will result in the need to adjust the dose to an<br>
appropriate therapeutic level. The use of either daily administration or post-<br>
periodic dosing may be employed. Preferably, a compound of Formula (I) or<br>
Formula (II) or pharmaceutical composition thereof for treating psychotic<br>
disorders is administered orally or parenterally.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, a compound of<br>
Formula (I) or Formula (II) or pharmaceutical composition thereof described<br>
herein may be administered separately, at different times during the course of<br>
therapy or concurrently in divided combination or single combination forms.<br>
Advantageously, a compound selected from the group consisting of Formula (I)<br>
and Formula (II) or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered<br>
in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered via<br>
continuous delivery or in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. The<br>
instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such methods<br>
and regimes of continuous, simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term<br>
"administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a<br>
mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment,<br>
observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological<br>
or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human, that is being<br>
sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, which<br>
includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a<br>
product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well<br>
as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
To prepare a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, a<br>
compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) as the active ingredient is intimately<br>
admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration<br>
(e.g. oral or parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well<br>
known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients.<br>
published by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the<br>
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.<br>
Methods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions have been<br>
described in numerous publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br>
Tablets. Second Edition. Revised and Expanded. Volumes 1-3, edited by<br>
Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosacie Forms: Parenteral Medications.<br>
Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br>
Disperse Systems, Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by<br>
Marcel Dekker, Inc.<br>
Preferably, a pharmaceutical composition is in a unit dosage form such<br>
as a tablet, pill, capsule, caplet, gelcap, lozenge, granule, powder, sterile<br>
parenteral solution or suspension, metered aerosol or liquid spray, drop,<br>
ampoule, autoinjector device or suppository for administration by oral,<br>
intranasal, sublingual, intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal,<br>
inhalation or insufflation means. Alternatively, the composition may be<br>
presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration or<br>
may be adapted to provide a preparation for intramuscular injection.<br>
In preparing a pharmaceutical composition having a solid dosage form<br>
for oral administration, such as a tablet, pill, capsule, caplet, gelcap, lozenge,<br>
granule or powder (each including immediate release, timed release and<br>
sustained release formulations), suitable carriers and additives include but are<br>
not limited to diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, glidants,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated,<br>
gelatin coated, film coated or enteric coated by standard techniques.<br>
For preparing a solid dosage form, the principal active ingredient is<br>
mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier (e.g. conventional tableting ingredients<br>
such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents<br>
and glidants). Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid<br>
dosage forms to improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally,<br>
colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for<br>
ease of identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are<br>
formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate<br>
dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.<br>
In preparing a pharmaceutical composition having a liquid dosage form<br>
for oral, topical and parenteral administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical<br>
media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid unit dosage forms, such<br>
as suspensions (i.e. colloids, emulsions and dispersions) and solutions,<br>
suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable wetting agents, dispersants, flocculation agents, thickeners, pH<br>
control agents (i.e. buffers), osmotic agents, coloring agents, flavors,<br>
fragrances, preservatives (i.e. to control microbial growth, etc.) and a liquid<br>
vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be<br>
required for each liquid dosage form. The liquid forms in which the novel<br>
compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration<br>
orally or by injection include, but are not limited to aqueous solutions, suitably<br>
flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with<br>
edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well<br>
as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Biological Experimental Example<br>
The activities of a compound of Formula (I) and Formula (II) for use in<br>
preventing or treating psychotic disorders were evaluated in the following<br>
experimental example which is intended to be a way of illustrating but not<br>
limiting the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
DOI-lnduced Headshake Model<br>
The administration of DOI to rodents has been used as a model for assessing<br>
potential efficacy of an atypical antipsychotic in treating psychosis and<br>
schizophrenia in certain patient populations with direct or indirect defects in the<br>
serotonin system.<br>
Male NIH Swiss mice weighing 18-21 grams at the time of purchase were<br>
obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Prattville, AL). They were<br>
individually housed in wire-mesh cages at an ambient temperature of 21 to<br>
23 °C with an automated 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. All rats had free access<br>
to 5001 Rodent Chow (Purina Mills, Brentwood, MO) and water except during<br>
experimental sessions. The principles of laboratory animal care (NIH<br>
publication No. 85-23, revised 1985) were followed.<br>
DOI (purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in saline,<br>
neutralized to pH ~7.4 and injected ip in a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.<br>
Injection solution was freshly prepared 30-45 minutes before each experiment.<br>
Methylcellulose (0.5%, Sigma) was used as oral dosing vehicle. All<br>
experiments were performed between 10 am and 4 pm during the day. The<br>
mice were fasted the evening before the experiment.<br>
An enantiomer of Formula (Ib), Formula (lIb) or vehicle was orally administered<br>
at various concentrations ranging from 10 µg to 100 mg/kg. The animals were<br>
then injected with either saline or DOI (ip, 5 mg/kg) 45 minutes after the<br>
administration of either vehicle or an enantiomer of Formula (Ib) or Formula<br>
(lIb). Immediately upon DOI administration, the mice were placed in isolated<br>
observation cylinders made of a clear polycarbonate (27 cm in diameter and 55<br>
cm deep). The number of randomized headshakes (or twitches) was recorded<br>
by an experienced observer using a hand held mechanical counter.<br>
Headshake responses were counted in consecutive 10-min periods.<br>
DOI-lnduced Headshake Model Analysis<br>
All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The average of the headshakes in<br>
the vehicle group was expressed as 100%. The DOI-induced headshakes in<br>
groups treated with an enantiomer of Formula (Ib) and Formula (lIb) were<br>
expressed as percent suppression compared to the vehicle group. Statistical<br>
analysis for significant differences was done with the Student t test.<br>
The average of the headshakes in the vehicle group was 7.95 ± 0.2,<br>
consistently obtained with 5 mg/kg of DOI (ip) in 382 mice. An enantiomer of<br>
Formula (Ib) suppressed the frequency of DOI-induced headshakes dose-<br>
dependently with a maximal suppression of 76% at the 100 mg/kg dose.<br>
Similar effects, but less potent, were observed in mice treated with an<br>
enantiomer of Formula (lIb), having a maximal suppression of DOI-induced<br>
headshakes of 43% at 100 mg/kg.<br>
Table 1 summarizes the experimental data (n is the number of animals per<br>
group):<br>
Example 2<br>
Pre-Pulse Inhibition Model<br>
The restorative effect of an enantiomer of Formula (Ib) on Pre-Pulse Inhibition<br>
(PPI) was compared to the disruptive PPI effect of phencyclidine (PCP). PCP<br>
is a NMDA antagonist having a wide range of psychotominetic effects in<br>
humans. The PPI disruption caused by PCP can be restored by some atypical<br>
antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine.<br>
Sprague-Dawley-derived male rats were housed in groups of two or three and<br>
maintained in a temperature-controlled environment on a 12h:12h light cycle.<br>
Except during behavioral testing, animals were given free access to food and<br>
water. Animals were handled daily for several days to desensitize them to<br>
handling stress before behavioral analysis.<br>
An SR-LAB Startle System was used to control auditory stimuli and<br>
background noise level and to monitor startle response (± one msec). The<br>
average amplitude of the response was the main dependent variable used.<br>
Animals (n = 20) were grouped according to a baseline mean PPI determined<br>
in a brief matching session. Baseline mean PPI testing consisted of 12 noise<br>
bursts at 118 dB[A] over a 40 msec time period followed by 3 noise bursts at<br>
12 dB[A] over a 40 msec time period two days before testing with drug.<br>
The rats were pretreated with an enantiomer of Formula (Ib) at 5, 15 and 45<br>
mg/kg (p.o.) 110 minutes prior to treatment with PCP (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in saline<br>
in a volume of 1 ml/kg. Rats were placed 10 minutes later into individual startle<br>
chambers for testing. Clozapine (7.5mg/kg) was used as a positive control.<br>
Testing was done with a 70 dB[A] background noise, followed by a series of<br>
startle trials, consisting of several conditions: 1) a 118 dB[A] noise burst over a<br>
40 msec time period, or 2) a 118 dB[A] noise burst over a 40 msec time period<br>
preceded by prepulses (118 dB[A] noise bursts over a 20 msec time period) at<br>
100 msec intervals.<br>
Data were collected online simultaneously from multiple startle chambers and<br>
analyzed using the Statview 5.0 statistical package. The results from this study<br>
showed that acute treatment with an enantiomer of Formula (Ib), up to 45<br>
mg/kg, failed to significantly block the PPI-disruptive effects of PCP. An<br>
enantiomer of Formula (Ib) also lacked an orderly dose-dependent reduction in<br>
startle magnitude in this study.<br>
While the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present<br>
invention, with examples provided for the purposes of illustration, it will be<br>
understood that the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual<br>
variations, adaptations and/or modifications as come within the scope of the<br>
following claims and their equivalents.<br>
