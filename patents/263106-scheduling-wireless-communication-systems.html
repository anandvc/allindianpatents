SCHEDULING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001]	The present disclosure relates generally to wireless<br>
communications and more particularly to scheduling mobile terminals<br>
in wireless communication systems and corresponding methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002]	In wireless communication systems, it is desirable to<br>
reduce overhead associated with signaling for voice and data services,<br>
system information, control, etc. In traditional GSM and UMTS<br>
systems, bearer establishment is enabled through dedicated signaling.<br>
The bearer defines radio parameters, for example, time slot, frequency,<br>
code, etc., associated with a channel during a call. In voice<br>
communications for example a dedicated channel is assigned to each<br>
user. In High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) systems,<br>
transport format and modulation/coding parameters (TFRI) are<br>
provided using dedicated control signaling on a shared control channel,<br>
wherein the shared control channel also signals the code channel<br>
assigned to the user.<br>
[0003]	In some data only (DO) systems, voice is served over IP<br>
(VoIP). It is known to improve such systems for VoIP traffic using<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) error correction schemes and<br>
smaller packet sizes. While VoIP users have the same benefits of<br>
advanced link adaptation and statistical multiplexing as data users, the<br>
greatly increased number of users that may be served because of the<br>
smaller voice packet sizes places a burden on control and feedback<br>
mechanisms of the system. It can be easily envisioned, for example,<br>
that 30 times as many voice packets could be served in a given frame<br>
than data packets. There are typically about 1500 bytes for data and<br>
about 40-50 bytes for voice. Present resource allocation and channel<br>
quality feedback and acknowledgment mechanisms however are not<br>
designed to handle such a large number of allocations.<br>
[0004]	In 802.16e systems, it is known to use a telescoping control<br>
channel that expands to include as many assignments as necessary for<br>
resource allocation. However, such an expansion mechanism does not<br>
address feedback or the fact that the entire downlink may be consumed<br>
for control information. Another mitigating mechanism is to group<br>
several voice packets together for transmission to a particular user.<br>
Unfortunately, this sort of packaging mechanism can adversely affect<br>
speech quality when a transmission is not received, since longer periods<br>
of speech are lost or corrupted. Thus there is a need for increasing the<br>
number of VoIP users supported while reducing control and feedback<br>
overhead. In packet based systems the term "data" is meant to signify<br>
payload information for any service, voice or data.<br>
[0005]	The various aspects, features and advantages of the present<br>
disclosure will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
skill in the art upon careful consideration of the following Detailed<br>
Description thereof with the accompanying drawings described below.<br>
The drawings may have been simplified for clarity and are not<br>
necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	FIG. 1 is an illustrative wireless communication network.<br>
[0007]	FIG. 2 is an illustrative sequence of radio frames each<br>
comprising a plurality of sub-frames.<br>
[0008]	FIG. 3 is an illustrative sub-frame including a control and<br>
data channels portions.<br>
[0009]	FIG. 4 illustrates a first resource allocation scheme.<br>
[0010]	FIG. 5 illustrates another resource allocation scheme.<br>
[0011] FIG. 6 illustrates yet another resource allocation<br>
scheme.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012]	FIG. 1 is a wireless digital communication system 100<br>
comprising a plurality of base transceiver stations 110 providing<br>
wireless communication service, including voice and/or data service, to<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
wireless terminals 102 over corresponding regions or cellular areas.<br>
The base transceiver stations, also referred to by other names such as a<br>
"Node B" depending on the system type, are communicably coupled to<br>
a controller 120 and to other entities that are not shown but are well<br>
known by those having ordinary skill in the art. In FIG. 1, each base<br>
transceiver station includes a scheduling entity 112 for radio resource<br>
scheduling among the wireless communication terminals within the<br>
network. Exemplary communication systems include, but are not<br>
limited to, developing Universal Mobile Telecommunications System<br>
(UMTS) networks, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-<br>
UTRA) networks, and other OFDM based networks.<br>
[0013]	E-UTRA and other communication protocols are being<br>
developed to support delivery of voice services over a packet domain,<br>
in contrast to the traditional support of voice over circuit switched<br>
domain. Thus there is interest in schemes that support voice traffic over<br>
a shared radio channel, wherein multiple users share the time and<br>
frequency resources of the radio interface. In order to attain a<br>
significant increase in capacity with E-UTRA, efficient radio resource<br>
allocation schemes will likely be required to accommodate voice traffic.<br>
In these and other applications, including data applications, it is<br>
generally desirable that control signaling overhead be minimized while<br>
offering flexibility to the scheduler at the network. In the general sense,<br>
it is useful to define a mechanism to efficiently signal resource<br>
allocation and related control channel information to multiple terminals<br>
applicable to a broadband wireless system, relying on shared channels<br>
for delivery of any service using packet based transmission.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
[0014]	FIG. 2 illustrates a sequence of radio frames 200 useful for<br>
communicating in wireless digital communication systems. In FIG. 2,<br>
the frame seqtience generally comprises a plurality of frames 210, 220,<br>
230, wherein each frame comprises a plurality of sub-frames. For<br>
example, frame 210 comprises a sub-frame 212 having a resource<br>
assignment control channel portion within a control channel portion<br>
214 and a data channel portion 216. In some embodiments, the frames<br>
constitute a repeating sequence of frames, wherein the repeating<br>
sequence may be a periodic or aperiodic repeating sequence.<br>
[0015]	FIG. 3 is a more detailed illustration of a sub-frame 300<br>
comprising a resource assignment control portion 310 and a data<br>
portion 320. The resource assignment control portion 310 includes<br>
downlink resource assignment information 312, uplink resource<br>
assignment information 314 and feedback information 316, among other<br>
information. The feedback information may relate to uplink and/or<br>
downlink communications, as discussed further below.<br>
[0016]	In one embodiment, a scheduler or other infrastructure<br>
entity in a wireless communication system groups wireless<br>
communication terminals in one or more groups. In one embodiment,<br>
the terminals are grouped based on radio channel conditions associated<br>
with the terminals, for example, channel quality information reported<br>
by the terminals, Doppler reported by the terminal, distance from the<br>
serving cell, among others. In another embodiment, the terminals are<br>
grouped based on terminal operating characteristic other than<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
participation in a common communication session. Exemplary terminal<br>
operating characteristics include power headroom of the terminals, or<br>
macro diversity considerations, terminal capability, service of the<br>
terminals, codec rate among other considerations. The groupings of the<br>
terminals may also be based on combinations of these and other criteria<br>
not specifically disclosed.<br>
[0017]	Generally, multiple terminals are assigned to<br>
corresponding groups. A terminal may be assigned to more than one<br>
group. Terminals may also be re-assigned from one group to a different<br>
group, for example, based on changing conditions used as criteria for<br>
the grouping. The terminal may also request re-assignment to a<br>
different group.<br>
[0018]	A network entity generally assigns one or more control<br>
channels to each group for radio resource assignment. Controls<br>
channels used for radio resource assignment are referred to herein as<br>
resource or radio resource assignment control channels, which are<br>
distinguished from other types of control channels. Generally, where<br>
there are multiple groups, each group has a different control channel or<br>
a different combination of control channels assigned thereto. Thus in<br>
one embodiment, a first control channel is assigned to a first group and<br>
a second control channel is assigned to a second group.<br>
[0019]	A network entity sends resource assignment control<br>
channel information to the terminals in the group wherein the control<br>
channel information indicates which frame(s) and corresponding sub-<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
frame(s) that the terminals in the group should monitor for radio<br>
resource assignments. The terminals in the group thus monitor the<br>
control channel(s) associated with the group to which the terminals are<br>
assigned. The terminals of the group may determine whether a radio<br>
resource has been assigned to the terminal based on information in the<br>
resource assignment control channel, as discussed further below. The<br>
resource assigned to each terminal may be determined based on an<br>
implied or explicit mapping, also discussed further below.<br>
[0020]	In one embodiment, each of the one or more groups is<br>
assigned to less than all sub-frames constituting a particular frame,<br>
wherein a radio resource assignment control channel of at least one<br>
assigned sub-frame is assigned to each group. Generally different<br>
groups are assigned to different sub-frames. In some embodiments,<br>
two or more groups may be assigned to the same sub-frame. In<br>
embodiments where two or more groups are assigned to the same sub-<br>
frame, the groups are assigned to different resource assignment control<br>
channels within the same sub-frame.<br>
[0021]	In FIG. 2, for example, a first control channel associated<br>
with a first group is assigned to a corresponding sub-frame 212 of frame<br>
210. Generally, the first group could be assigned to multiple sub-frames<br>
in the frame, but not to all sub-frames thereof. Also, generally, each<br>
group is assigned to a sub-frame in different frames in the sequence. In<br>
FIG. 2, for example, the group may be assigned to sub-frame 212 in<br>
frame 210 and to sub-frame 232 in frame 230.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
[0022]	Generally, the frames are part of a repeating sequence of<br>
frames for purposes of reading a resource assignment control channel.<br>
Each group may thus be assigned to less than all sub-frames<br>
constituting a frame in a repeating sequence of frames. In some<br>
embodiments, the group /sub-frame assignments are periodic, and in<br>
other embodiments the assignments are not periodic. Thus a group<br>
may be assigned to the same sub-frame(s) in the same frame in a<br>
sequence of multiple frames. For example, a group is assigned to a first<br>
sub-frame in a first frame in each sequence of frames. In another<br>
embodiment, a group may be assigned to different sub-frame(s) in the<br>
same frame in the sequence of frames. For example, a group is assigned<br>
to a first sub-frame in a first frame in the first sequence of frames, and<br>
the group is assigned to a second sub-frame in the first frame in in the<br>
second sequence of frames. In another embodiment, a group is<br>
assigned to same sub-frame(s) in different frames of the sequence of<br>
frames. For example, a group is assigned to a first sub-frame in a first<br>
frame in the first sequence of frames, and then the group is assigned to<br>
the first sub-frame in the second frame in the second sequence of<br>
frames. More generally, a group may be assigned to every nth sub-<br>
frame in a continuous sequence of frames.<br>
[0023]	Different types of information may be communicated over<br>
the control channel. One type of information is radio resource<br>
assignment information. Other types include modulation format,<br>
coding rate and HARQ information. Another type of control channel<br>
information is feedback, for example, ACK/NACK signaling<br>
information. Generally, feedback control information that the terminal<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
sends is on a different control channel than the control channel<br>
indicating radio resource assignment. Information not related to radio<br>
resource assignment may be communicated with a radio resource<br>
indication, for example, in a radio fesource assignment control channel.<br>
Alternatively, non-radio resource assignment information may be<br>
indicated in a separate portion of a sub-frame, or it may be known a<br>
priori by the terminal.<br>
[0024]	In FIG. 3, for example, feedback control channel<br>
information is communicated in bit map 316. Such feedback<br>
information, for example, ACK/NACK information, is for previous<br>
transmissions by terminals in the group or for prior reception by the<br>
terminals in the group for transmissions sent by a network entity. In<br>
one embodiment, each terminal in the group is assigned to a location in<br>
the bit map, wherein the terminal reads its assigned bit map location in<br>
the control channel to obtain the feedback information.<br>
[0025]	A radio resource may be assigned to at least one terminal<br>
of the group with radio resource assignment information in the control<br>
channel. Generally, the resource assignment information may<br>
simultaneously assign different portions of the radio resource to<br>
corresponding terminals of the group. The resource assignments may<br>
be for the uplink or the downlink. In FIG. 3, downlink assignments are<br>
made by the downlink resource assignment information 312 and uplink<br>
assignments are made by the uplink resource assignment information<br>
314. Also, the radio resource assignment information may indicate that<br>
the radio resource assigned is located in more than one sub-frame,<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
wherein the assigned sub-frames may be in the same frame or in<br>
different frames on either the uplink or downlink. For uplink resource<br>
assignments, the radio resource assignment information may provide<br>
frame/sub-frame offset information.<br>
[0026]	In EUTRA, radio resources are assigned as a set of sub-<br>
carriers over a timeslot. Thus in E-UTRA Scheduling embodiments, for<br>
example, the radio resource assignment includes assigning a sub-carrier<br>
for a specified time interval. In UMTS scheduling embodiments, the<br>
radio resource assignment includes assigning a channelization code in a<br>
frequency channel for a specified time interval. These radio resource<br>
assignments are only illustrative and not intended to limit the subject<br>
matter of the disclosure.<br>
[0027]	Generally, the radio resource assignment information of the<br>
control channel identifies at least one terminal to which a radio resource<br>
has been assigned. In one embodiment, one or more terminals to which<br>
a resource has been assigned are identified by information in the control<br>
channel. In another embodiment, the identity is a group identity<br>
assigned to at least one terminal. In a more particular embodiment, the<br>
terminals to which a resource has been assigned are identified and the<br>
order in which the terminals are identified dictates what resource has<br>
been assigned. For example, if three of the 5 terminals in a group are<br>
identified as having been assigned a resource, by virtue of the terminals<br>
having been referenced by a code or other identifier in the control<br>
channel assignment information, the first referenced terminal is<br>
assigned a first unique predefined radio resource, the second referenced<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
terminal is assigned a second unique predefined radio resource, and the<br>
third referenced terminal is assigned a third unique predefined radio<br>
resource, wherein the unique predefined radio resources are known a<br>
priori by the terminals in the group. Thus in this first embodiment,<br>
only the identity of the terminals to which an assignment has been<br>
made needs to be communicated by the scheduler to the group. FIG. 4<br>
illustrates a sub-channel 400 comprising a control channel 410 having a<br>
resource assignment bit map 420 with locations that are mapped to<br>
unique predefined radio resources in the data channel 430. Particularly,<br>
resource assignment location 422 is associated with radio resource 432<br>
and bit map location 424 is associated with radio resource 434. Each of<br>
the other bit map location is also associated with a corresponding radio<br>
resource.<br>
[0028]	In an alternative embodiment, the control channel<br>
assignment information may include additional information associated<br>
with each terminal reference indicating what resource has been<br>
assigned. In this alternative embodiment, for each assignment, the<br>
control channel information must identify the terminal and identify the<br>
radio resource assigned. FIG. 5 illustrates a sub-channel 500 comprising<br>
a control channel 510 having a resource assignment bit map 520 with<br>
locations that are mapped to unique predefined radio resources in the<br>
data channel 530. Particularly, resource assignment location 522<br>
includes additional bit defining radio resource 532 and bit map location<br>
424 includes additional bit defining radio resource 534. The use of<br>
additional bits to define the radio resources provides the scheduler with<br>
greater flexibility in scheduling and allocating radio resources.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
[0029]	In another alternative embodiment, the control channel<br>
assignment information includes additional (pointer) information<br>
associated with each terminal indicating where to obtain a resource<br>
assignment. FIG. 6 illustrates a sub-channel 600 comprising a control<br>
channel 610 having a resource assignment bit map 620 with locations<br>
that include pointers to unique predefined radio resources in the data<br>
channel 630. Particularly, resource assignment location 622 includes<br>
additional bits pointing to location 626, which defines or identifies radio<br>
resource 632. The resource assignment location 624 includes additional<br>
bits pointing to location 628, which defines or identifies radio resource<br>
634.<br>
[0030]	In another embodiment, each terminal in the group is<br>
associated with a location within a bit map that is part of the<br>
assignment control channel. In FIG. 3, for example, five terminals in a<br>
group are each associated with a corresponding location in the uplink<br>
and downlink resource assignment control channels. For example, the<br>
first terminal reads the first location 318, the second terminal reads the<br>
second location 322, etc. in each of the uplink and downlink assignment<br>
channels. In one embodiment, a unique pre-defined radio resource,<br>
known a priori by each terminal, is associated with each bit map<br>
location. According to this exemplary embodiment, the bit map merely<br>
needs to indicate whether or not an assignment has been made.<br>
[0031]	In one embodiment, a communication terminal is grouped<br>
in first and second groups. For example, one group may be associated<br>
with frequency diverse radio resources and another group associated<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
with frequency selective radio resources. In one exemplary application,<br>
a terminal is assigned to a frequency selective group for a first<br>
transmission and to a frequency diverse group for re-transmissions.<br>
Alternatively, a terminal may be assigned to a frequency diverse group<br>
for first transmissions and to a frequency selective group for re-<br>
transmissions. In another application, one group may be for receiving<br>
compressed information and another group for receiving uncompressed<br>
information. Multiple grouping may also be based on whether the<br>
terminal is communicating both data and voice, and more generally<br>
whether the terminal is communicating using both longer and shorter<br>
data packets. Also terminals may be grouped in more than one group<br>
to address overload conditions. Terminals may also be grouped in<br>
multiple groups for other reasons not explicitly identified herein.<br>
[0032]	The first and second groups to which the terminal is<br>
assigned may be assigned to the same sub-frames or to different sub-<br>
frames in the same or different frames. In embodiments where<br>
terminals are grouped in more than one group, the first and second<br>
groups are assigned or associated with less than all sub-frames of the<br>
same or different frame.<br>
[0033]	In one embodiment, a terminal is assigned to first and<br>
second groups wherein the first and second groups are assigned to the<br>
same sub-frames of the same frame. Such a grouping assignment may<br>
be suitable for terminals using compressed and uncompressed<br>
communications. This exemplary grouping assignment is also suitable<br>
for terminals simultaneously using voice and data services. Another<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
application for this exemplary grouping is to accommodate overload<br>
conditions. An overload condition may occur when terminals in a<br>
particular group require more resources than are available for the group<br>
in a particular sub-frame. Thus where resources are unavailable in a<br>
sub-frame associated with the primary group, a terminal may be<br>
granted resources in a different sub-frame associated with a secondary<br>
group. In one embodiment, a terminal is assigned to first and second<br>
groups wherein the first and second groups are assigned to different<br>
sub-frames of the same frame. Such a grouping assignment may be<br>
suitable for terminals simultaneously using voice and data services.<br>
Another application for this exemplary grouping is to accommodate<br>
overload conditions. In another embodiment, a terminal is assigned to<br>
first and second groups wherein the first and second groups are<br>
assigned to the same or different sub-frames of different frames. Such a<br>
grouping assignment may also be suitable for terminals simultaneously<br>
using voice and data services.<br>
[0034]	In one embodiment where a terminal is assigned to first<br>
and second groups, a control channel is assigned to at least one sub-<br>
frame of the first and/or second group. In one embodiment, first and<br>
second groups are assigned to common sub-frames of a common frame,<br>
and different control channels are assigned to at least one sub-frame in<br>
the first and second groups. The control channels may or may not be<br>
resource assignment control channels.<br>
[0035]	In another embodiment where a terminal is assigned to<br>
first and second groups, a resource assignment control channel is<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
assigned to at least one sub-frame of the first and/or second group, and<br>
a radio resource is assigned to the terminal grouped in the first and<br>
second groups over the resource assignment control channel. The<br>
assigned radio resource may be in the same sub-frame as the control<br>
channel and/or in one or more different sub-frames of the same or<br>
different frame as the sub-frame in which the control channel is located.<br>
In another embodiment, the assigned radio resource is in at least one of<br>
two sub-frame groups, wherein each sub-frame group includes at least<br>
one sub-frame and each of the first and second groups is associated<br>
with a corresponding one of the sub-frame groups. The assigned radio<br>
resource may be in at least one of two different sub-frame groups, or the<br>
assigned radio resource may be in two or more different sub-frame<br>
groups.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, the wireless communication terminal<br>
determines a radio resource assignment based on control channel<br>
information on an assigned control channel, wherein the control<br>
channel information indicates all possible assignments of first and<br>
second radio resources to the terminal. Particularly, either one of the<br>
first or second resources may be assigned, or both the first and second<br>
resources may be assigned, or neither of the first and second resources<br>
may be assigned.<br>
[0037]	In one embodiment, the radio resource assignment is<br>
determined based on control channel information received in first<br>
and/or second sub-frames. In one embodiment, for example, an uplink<br>
radio resource assignment is determined based on control channel<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
information received in the first sub-frame, and a downlink radio<br>
resource assignment is determined based on control channel<br>
information received in the second sub-frame. Non-resource<br>
assignment information, for example, modulation format, coding rate,<br>
etc., may also be communicated over a control channel and determined<br>
by the terminal for one or more radio resources assigned to the<br>
terminal, hi one embodiment, the non-resource assignment information<br>
may be located in the data channel portion of a sub-frame, wherein the<br>
location of the non-resource assignment information is known to the<br>
terminal a prior or information is included in the control channel<br>
indicating the location of the non-resource assignment information.<br>
[0038]	In one embodiment, a wireless communication terminal<br>
determines whether it has been assigned first and second radio<br>
resources by monitoring first and second corresponding control<br>
channels. In one particular embodiment, the terminal determines<br>
whether it has been assigned the second radio resource only if the first<br>
radio resource was not assigned. In another particular embodiment, the<br>
terminal is assigned a first radio resource through a first control channel<br>
and, thereafter, the terminal monitors a second control channel only if a<br>
condition is not satisfied in connection with the radio resource assigned<br>
via the first control channel. For example, if the terminal experiences a<br>
failed transmission or reception on the first radio resource, the terminal<br>
would monitor the second control channel for an alternate radio<br>
resource assignment.<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
[0039]	In another embodiment, a wireless communication<br>
terminal monitors a first control channel for radio resource assignment<br>
information on a wireless communication network and, while<br>
monitoring the first control channel, the terminal obtains information<br>
for monitoring a second control channel on the same wireless<br>
communication network. In one embodiment, the second control<br>
channel is different than the first control channel wherein the terminal<br>
may monitor one or both of the first and second control channels. In<br>
other embodiment, the terminal the second control channel instead of<br>
the first control channel, wherein the second control channel is a<br>
modification of the first control channel. An exemplary modification is<br>
one such that the modified control channel is capable of assigning<br>
resources associated with groups to which the terminal has been<br>
associated at an infrastructure entity, for example, a base station<br>
scheduler. This additional control channel monitoring information may<br>
be obtained by reading a broadcast control or other channel, or by<br>
receiving a dedicated message. Assignment to a secondary group may<br>
be to accommodate services, for example, voice or data, in addition to<br>
services already used by the terminal. Such a subsequent assignment<br>
may also be for addressing overloading conditions. The terminal may<br>
monitor the second channel for radio resource assignments or for other<br>
information.<br>
[0040]	In one embodiment, the terminal determines whether the<br>
terminal has been identified, by at least one of two different identities<br>
assigned to the terminal, in the control channel information monitored<br>
by the terminal. For example, the terminal may be assigned one or<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2007/044173	PCT/US2006/035525<br>
more identities by a scheduler, wherein each identity is associated with<br>
a corresponding group to which the terminal has been associated by the<br>
scheduler. The terminal may thus use the one or more identities to<br>
determine which radio resources, for example, uplink, downlink, voice,<br>
data, first transmission, re-transmission, etc., have been assigned.<br>
[0041]	While the present disclosure and the best modes thereof<br>
have been described in a manner establishing possession by the<br>
inventors and enabling those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use<br>
the same, it will be understood and appreciated that there are many<br>
