				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a miniaturised device for producing high pressure in a fluid.<br>
Tne invention relates to a device for producing high pressure in a fluid.  It consists of a piston which is movable in a cylinder, and a valve, both of miniaturised construction. The invention further relates to a high pressure atomiser which contains this device, and the use thereof, preferably for medicinal purposes.<br>
The aim of the invention is to enable a device of this kind and the atomiser containing the device to be made simpler in design and cheaper to produce.<br>
In liquid chromatography (HPLC), for example, generally relatively small quantities of liquid are conveyed at high pressure through the separating column. Moreover, in medicinal aerosol therapy, aerosols are used, by atomising or nebulising liquid drugs for treating diseases of the respiratory tract in humans or for treating asthmatic conditions. Here again, a high pressure is required in a, generally relatively small, quantity of fluid, in order to produce the small droplet size needed for the aerosol. In the nebulizer according to WO-91/14458 a given volume of; a fluid is sprayed through a nozzle with a small aperture .under a pressure of between 5 and 40 MPa {about 50 to 400 bar) to produce an aerosol.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide a device suitable for producing high pressure in a fluid and. an atomiser containing this device, the device for producing high, pressure being easier to produce and  optimally adapted to its function, preferably in a high pressure atomiser.<br>
The first part of this problem is solved according to the invention by a devic for producing high pressure in a fluid, of miniaturised constrution, consisting of<br>
a piston which is movable in a cylinder, a high pressure chamber located in front of the piston inside the cylinder, and a valve, characterised by:<br>
a cylindrical hollow piston,<br>
a valve member which is guided by the hollow piston and: is mounted so as to be axially movable against the hollow piston,<br>
a stop means on the hollow piston which holds the valve member together with the hollow piston, and<br>
a defined sealing surface at the inlet end of the valve member.<br>
In the specification which follows, the terms inlet and outlet side or inlet and outlet end are used in relation to the main direction of flow of the fluid within the device.<br>
The valve member is somewhat displaceable against the hollow piston but it moves substantially with the hollow piston.<br>
The valve member is preferably uniaxially rotationally symmetrical in shape, e.g. it is a circular cylinder or a frustum. Its cross-section is somewhat smaller than the cross- sect ion of the chamber in which Che valve member is movably mounted. This is achieved by means of one or more channels preferably extending in the outer surface of the cylindrical valve member, or by a somewhat smaller diameter of the valve member in relation to the diameter of the chamber in which the valve member is movably mounted.<br>
The valve member is guided in the chamber in which it is movably mounted; the cylindrical valve member can rotate about its axis as required, but its axis always remains parallel to the axis of the hollow piston. This produces a defined sealing surface at the inlet of the valve member.<br>
The distance over which the valve member can travel relative to the hollow piston is limited by a stop or stop means which holds the movable valve member together with the hollow piston.<br>
In the region of the outlet end of the valve member there is at least one recess to enable the fluid to flow through between the stop and the valve member when the valve is open. The or each recess is located either in the valve member at the outlet end thereof or in the stop in the hollow piston.<br>
In the position where the valve member abuts on the stop of the hollow piston, the valve is opened. In the position where the valve member abuts on the defined sealing surface, the valve is closed.<br>
The valve member arranged inside the hollow piston has virtually no friction against the inner wall of the hollow piston. The valve member arranged directly in front of the end of the hollow piston may possibly rub against the wall of the cylinder.  In this case, the valve is actively closed and opened as the hollow piston moves, on account of the friction between the valve member and the cylinder wall.<br>
The cylinder preferably consists of plastics and the hollow piston of metal or plastics. The material for the valve member is selected, in terms of its hardness, to complement the hardness of the material for the hollow piston and may be metal, ceramics, glass, gemstone, plastics or elastomer. The valve member is preferably manufactured in one piece.<br>
When the fluid is sucked in, the high pressure chamber is connected to the fluid supply by means of the channels in the valve member. During the intake stroke of the hollow piston the fluid flows through the hollow piston and past the valve member into the high pressure chamber of the cylinder. During the exhaust stroke of the hollow piston the valve is sealed in high pressure tight manner against the defined sealing surface of the valve member.<br>
The device according to the invention for producing high pressure in a fluid is connected to the fluid supply at its inlet end. The high pressure chamber is connected to another device into which or through which<br>
the fluid is conveyed under high pressure. The hollow piston or the cylinder is attached to a drive which brings about relative movement between the hollow piston and cylinder and which applies the force required to generate the high pressure.<br>
In the first embodiment, the cylindrical valve member may be guided and mounted in axially mcvable manner directly in front of the end of the hollow piston, the diameter of the valve member being substantially equal to the internal diameter of the cylinder.  On the outside, near its outlet end, the hollow piston has an encircling, preferably turned or shaped groove as a stop member, into which a plurality of snap hooks mounted on the valve member engage. Instead of the groove, the hollow piston may have at its outlet end a shaped taper with an encircling, outwardly funnel-shaped edge. The outer diameter of the hollow piston at its outlet end is greater than the base diameter of the groove and less than the diameter of the cylinder. Instead of the encircling groove, the outlet end of the hollow piston may be provided on the outside, at several, preferably 2 diametrically opposed points, with flattened areas which form a step to act as a stop means. The flat end of the hollow piston is the defined sealing surface. The outer edge at the end of: the hollow piston may be chamfered.<br>
In the second embodiment, the cylindrical valve member may be guided and movably mounted directly in front of the end of the hollow piston, the diameter of the valve member being substantially equal to the internal diameter of the cylinder. The end of the hollow piston is shaped inwardly and acts as a stop means.  On the valve member is mounted a coaxial, undercut, mushroom-shaped peg the snap hooks of which engage behind the shaped edge of the hollow piston.  The defined sealing surface rests on the outside of the piston at the shaped edge.<br>
In the third embodiment, the preferably cylindrical<br>
valve member may be mounted so as to be fully movable inside the hollow piston. The outlet end of the hollow piston has an internal diameter greater than the internal diameter of the remainder of the hollow piston. The length of this widened portion of the hollow piston is somewhat greater than the length of the valve member. The diameter of the valve member is substantially equal to the inner diameter at the widened end of the hollow piston. The outlet end of the hollow piston is shaped inwardly either over its entire periphery or over a part of its periphery and acts as a stop which holds the valve member inside the hollow piston. The base of the widened portion which forms the defined sealing surface may be flat or conical. The recess in the valve member may, for example, take the form of a stepped channel. The recess in the stop may be constructed, for example, as an indentation.<br>
In a variant of this embodiment, the valve member may be arranged totally inside the hollow piston at the inlet end thereof. The stop will then be located at the outlet end of the widened portion and the defined sealing surface will then be on the shaped edge at the inlet end of the hollow piston.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the hollow piston consists of a thin-walled tube which is shaped at its end projecting into the cylinder and is provided with an encircling constriction at the end of the space allowed for the valve member. The cylindrical valve member is guided and movably mounted in the space between the shaped edge and the encircling constriction. Another thick-walled tube may be pushed into the inlet end of the hollow piston, its outer diameter being equal to the inner diameter of the hollow piston, and this thick-walled tube further being fixedly connected to the hollow piston and preferably extending approximately up to the encircling constriction in the hollow piston.  The thick-walled tube acts as a displacement member and makes it easier for the fluid to be sucked into the high<br>
pressure chamber virtually without pressure. The thick-walled tube is preferably made of plastics.<br>
In a variant of this embodiment, the valve member may be mounted fully inside the hollow piston at the inlet end thereof, The stop is then located at the encircling constriction and the defined sealing surface is located at the shaped edge at the inlet end of the hollow piston.<br>
In the fifth embodiment, the hollow piston comprises a thin-walled tube which contains a thick-walled tube the outer diameter of which is equal to the inner diameter of the hollow piston, and which is fixedly connected to the hollow piston. The thick-walled tube functions as a displacement body and makes it easier for the fluid to be sucked in virtually without pressure.<br>
The inlet end of the hollow piston is widened. At the widened end, the hollow piston is fixedly connected to a closure member the outer diameter of which is greater than the outer diameter of the widened inlet end of the hollow piston. The closure member contains a depression which is open on its side facing the widened end of the hollow piston. In the base of the depression is an opening acting as an inlet for the fluid. The base of the depression may be conical or flat; it forms the defined sealing surface.<br>
The valve member is arranged in the depression, in the closure member; it. is guided so as to be axially movable in the depression. The external diameter of the valve member is smaller than the internal diameter of the depression, but preferably greater than the internal diameter of the hollow piston in that part of it which projects into the cylinder. The valve member may contain, at its outlet end, at least one recess through which the fluid flows into the high pressure chamber during the intake stroke of the hollow piston.<br>
The stop for the valve member is preferably the end of the displacement body which projects into the widened<br>
portion or the hollow piston, or if the end of the displacement body is located in the unwidened portion of the hollow piston - the transition from the unwidened portion of the hollow piston into the widened inlet end thereof.<br>
The hollow piston, with the widened inlet end preferably consists of metal. The displacement body and closure member are preferably made of plastics. The valve member may be made of plastics or metal.<br>
Of particular significance is the use of the device according to the invention for producing high pressure in a fluid in an atomiser (nebulizer) for propellent-free spraying of the fluid.<br>
The second part of the objective is achieved according to the invention by an atomiser for spraying a fluid, consisting of an upper housing part, a pump housing, a nozzle, a blocking mechanism, a spring housing, a spring and a supply container, characterised by<br>
a pump housing fixed in the upper housing part, which has at one end a nozzle member with the nozzle,<br>
a hollow piston with valve member,<br>
a drive flange in which the hollow piston is secured and which is located in the upper housing part,<br>
a blocking mechanism located in the upper housing part,<br>
a spring housing with the spring located therein, which is rotatably mounted by means of a rotary bearing on the upper housing part,<br>
a lower housing part which is fitted onto the spring housing in the axial direction.<br>
The hollow piston with valve member corresponds to one of the devices according to the invention mentioned hereinbefore.  It projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing and is mounted in axially movable manner in the cylinder. The hollow piston with valve member exerts a pressure of 5 to 60 MPa (about 50 to 600 bar) , preferably 10 to 60 MPa (about 100 to 600 bar) on<br>
the fluid at its high pressure end at the moment of release of the spring.<br>
The nozzle in the nozzle member is preferably microstructured, ie. produced by microtechnology. Microstructured nozzle members are disclosed, for<br>
example, in #0-94/07607; we hereby refer to the contents of this specification.<br>
The nozzle member consists, for example, of two plates of glass and/or silicon firmly joined together, of which at least one plate has one or more microstructured channels which connect the nozzle inlet end to the nozzle outlet end. At the nozzle outlet end is at least one circular or non-circular opening less than or equal to 10µm in size.<br>
The directions of. spraying of the nozzles in the nozzle member may run parallel to one another or may be inclined relative to one another. In a nozzles member having at least two nozzle openings at the outlet end, the directions of spray may be inclined relative to one another at an angle from 20 to 160", preferably at an angle from 60 to 150°. The directions of spraying meet in the vicinity of the nozzle openings.<br>
In the pump housing, a non-return valve with or without spring bias may be provided between the nozzle opening and the high pressure chamber of the cylinder. This non-return valve closes off the high pressure chamber in the resting state of the atomiser, protects the fluid from the entrance of air and may if necessary prevent volatile components of the fluid from evaporating out of the pump housing.  The non-return valve opens automatically as soon as the pressure of the fluid in the high pressure chamber exceeds a minimum value and the current of fluid is created; it closes automatically as soon as the current of fluid is<br>
exhausted. The non-return valve may be, for example, a<br>
t ball valve. It may also consist of a flexible plate<br>
which is clamped on one side and rests like a flap on the outlet end of the high pressure chamber.  In another<br>
embodiment it may consist of a disk of preferably flexible material, clamped all the way round, pierced by a pin. The pierced hole allows the current of fluid to pass through to the nozzle as soon as the pressure in the fluid exceeds a minimum value. After the current of fluid is exhausted, the pin hole closes up again.<br>
The valve member is preferably mounted at the end of the hollow piston facing the nozzle member.<br>
The blocking mechanism contains a spring, preferably a cylindrical helical compression spring, as a store for mechanical energy. The spring acts on the driven flange as a jumping member the movement of which is determined by the position of a blocking member. The path of travel of the driven flange is precisely defined by an upper and lower stop. The spring is preferably tensioned by an external torque via a power stepping-up gear, eg. a helical thrust gear, which is generated as the upper housing part rotates counter to the spring housing in the lower housing part. In this case, the upper housing part and the driven flange contain a single or multiple wedge gear.<br>
The blocking member with engaging blocking surfaces is arranged -in an annular configuration around the driven flange. It consists, for example, of a. plastics or metal ring which is inherently radially resiliently deformable. The ring is arranged in a plane at right angles to the atomiser axis. After the biassing of the spring, the blocking surfaces of the blocking member move into the path of the driven flange and prevent the spring from being released. The blocking member is actuated by a button. The actuating button is connected or coupled to the blocking member. In order to actuate the blocking mechanism the actuating button is pushed parallel to the plane of the ring, preferably into the atomiser; the deformable ring is thereby deformed in the plane of the ring.<br>
The atomiser optionally contains a mechanical counter consisting of a spindle with rotational barrier<br>
which is mounted on the spring housing.  The axis of the spindle extends in the region of the outer surface parallel to the axis of the atomiser. The spindle is mounted, in the region of its ends, by means of a rotary bearing on the spring housing.  The spindle has teeth at the end closest to the upper housing part. On the edge of the upper housing part is at least one cam which, engages in the teeth at the end of the spindle when the two housing parts are rotated relative to one another. A slider with rotation prevention means sits on the spindle.<br>
The lower housing part is pushed axially over the spring housing and covers the mounting, the drive of the spindle and the storage container for the fluid.  The position of the slider is visible through a recess in the lower housing part and can be read off on a scale, eg. on the lower housing part.<br>
When the atomiser is actuated the upper housing part is rotated relative to the lower housing part, the lower housing part carrying the spring housing with it. The spring meanwhile is compressed and biassed by means of the helical thrust gear, and the blocking mechanism engages automatically. The angle of rotation is preferably a whole-number fraction of 360º, eg. 180º. At the same time as the spring is biassed, the driven part in the upper housing part is moved a certain distance, the hollow piston is retracted inside the cylinder in the pump housing, as a result of which some of: the fluid is sucked out of the storage container into the high pressure chamber in front of the nozzle.<br>
By means of the gears, which consist of the teeth on one end of the spindle and the or each cam on the edge of the upper housing part, the relative movement of the two housing parts is picked up and converted into a rotary movement of the spindle and displacement of the slider on the spindle.  On each actuation of the atomiser, the slider is moved a certain distance along the spindle.<br>
The position of the slider indicates what proportion of the fluid to be atomised has already been taken from the storage container and how much is still available. The slider on the spindle can be reset if necessary by means of a resetting lug.<br>
If desired, a plurality of replaceable storage containers holding the fluid which is to be atomised can be inserted into the atomiser one after another and used. The storage container is not pressurised or substantially-not pressurised. The pressure of the fluid in the storage container is in any case substantially lower than the pressure generated in the high pressure chamber by the mechanically operated atomiser. The storage container contains, for example, a fluid containing a drug.<br>
The atomising process is started by gently pressing the actuating button. The blocking mechanism then opens up a path for the driven part to move. The biassed spring pushes the piston into the cylinder of the pump housing. The fluid leaves the nozzle of the atomiser in spray form.<br>
The components of the atomiser are made of a material which is suitable for the function. The housing of the atomiser and, insofar as function allows, other parts are preferably made of plastics, eg. by injection moulding.  For medicinal purposes, physiologically acceptable materials are used.<br>
The atomiser according to the invention is used, for example, for propellant-free production of medicinal aerosols. An inhalable aerosol with an average particle size of about 5 µm can be produced thereby.<br>
The following active substances are mentioned by way of example of pharmaceutical compositions in the form of aqueous or ethanolic solutions, depending ,cn the solubility of the active substance: berotec, berodual, flunisolide, atrovent, salbutamol, budesonide, combivent, tiotropium, oxivent and suitable peptides.<br>
The solutions may also contain pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients..<br>
The device according to the invention for producing<br>
high pressure in a fluid and the atomiser containing<br>
this device have the following advantages:<br>
The device contains a valve which operates without<br>
any auxiliary force (produced by a spring) and<br>
closes as a result of the flow resistance of the<br>
fluid on the valve member or as a result of the<br>
friction on the cylinder wall.<br>
The valve is tight against a pressure generally<br>
above 3 MPa (30 bar) .<br>
The valve member is made in one piece; it is easy<br>
to manufacture and assemble.<br>
The valve closes very rapidly owing to the short<br>
distance travelled by the valve member to reach the<br>
defined sealing surface.<br>
The valve has a high sealing action.<br>
As a result of the guiding of the uniaxially<br>
rotationally symmetrical valve member, a defined<br>
sealing surface is produced which is high pressure<br>
tight through a very large number of cycles of<br>
movement of the hollow piston.<br>
The dead space of the high pressure chamber can be<br>
kept extremely small.<br>
The atomiser can be operated safely and easily even<br>
by untrained persons, both to bias the spring and<br>
to actuate the atomising process.<br>
The atomiser works without propellant gas and is<br>
therefore environmentally friendly.<br>
The storage container for the fluid is not<br>
pressurised or substantially not pressurised.<br>
The movement of the blocking member is<br>
automatically coupled, by a simple method, to the<br>
rotary movement for Massing the spring.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the atomiser consists of<br>
low-wear purely mechanical components and operates<br>
reliably over long periods.<br>
Owing to the defined abutments for the driven part<br>
the metering of the fluid is very accurate.<br>
The atomiser can be manufactured cheaply and<br>
assembled easily.<br>
The mechanical counter is automatically advanced as<br>
the atomiser is actuated; it is uncritical of<br>
tolerance, easy to assemble and operates safely and<br>
reliably.<br>
The counter is inaccessible when the atomiser is<br>
used properly and cannot be falsified by accident.<br>
The counter can be adapted to any number of<br>
releases of fluid from the storage container and to<br>
different overall numbers of storage containers to<br>
be used with one atomiser.<br>
The counter is integrated in the atomiser and does<br>
not take up any additional space.<br>
No substances can pass from the counter into the<br>
substance which is to be atomised.<br>
The device according to the invention for producing high pressure in a fluid and the atomiser containing this device are explained more fully with reference to Figures l to 6.<br>
Figure la shows a longitudinal section, viewed obliquely, through the first embodiment of the device according to the invention for producing high pressure in a fluid.  In the cylinder (1) is the hollow piston (2) with the coaxial bore (7) and the valve member (3) in the partly open position of the valve. Between the bottom of the valve member (3) and the end of the cylinder is the high pressure chamber (4). The high pressure chamber is closed off by another component (not shown). Mounted on the hollow piston, outside the cylinder, is a device (non shown) by means of which the hollow piston can be displaced inside the cylinder.<br>
Figure ib shows the hollow piston (2) viewed obliquely. The end of the hollow piston facing the valve member is provided with a groove (5) which is bounded, at its end facing the valve member, by a step (8) the diameter of which is less than the external<br>
diameter of the hollow piston (2) and greater than the base diameter of the groove. The front edge at the end of the hollow piston may be chamfered.<br>
Figure 1c shows the valve Timber (3) viewed obliquely,  it has, for example, three channels (9) on its outer surface. Mounted on the valve member (3), on its side facing the hollow piston, are, for example, three snap hooks (6) the width of which, in the direction of the circumference of the valve member, is less than a third of this circumference. The snap hooks<br>
(6)	are shorter in the axial direction than the length<br>
of the, for example, gxooved end of the hollow piston.<br>
During assembly, the valve member {3) is placed on the end of the hollow piston (2), and the hooks (10) slide into the groove. The hollow piston together with the valve member is then pushed into the cylinder.<br>
When the valve is open, the inner edge o£ the hooks (10) abut on the step (8). When the valve is closed, the base of the valve member (3) facing the hollow piston fits tightly on the end of the hollow piston (2) which acts as the defined sealing surface.<br>
In order to take in the fluid, the hollow piston is<br>
lifted partly out of the cylinder, whereupon the valve<br>
automatically opens. The fluid flows through the bore<br>
(7)	in the hollow piston and past the valve member into<br>
the high pressure chamber (4) .  In order to expel the<br>
fluid, the hollow piston (2) is pushed into the cylinder<br>
(1), whereupon the valve closes automatically, virtually<br>
instantly, and high pressure is generated in the fluid.<br>
Figure 2a shows the second embodiment of the device according to the invention for producing high pressure in a fluid as a longitudinal section viewed obliquely. In the cylinder (1) is the hollow piston (11) and the valve member (13) in the partly open position of the valve.<br>
Figure 2b shows a longitudinal section through the" hollow piston (11) with the shaped outlet end (12) of the hollow piston. The displacement body (26) may be<br>
located in the hollow piston.<br>
Figure 2c shows the valve member (13) as a longitudinal section viewed obliquely. Mounted on the valve member is a coaxial, undercut peg (14) the projecting end of which engages behind the shaped edge (12) of the hollow piston.
