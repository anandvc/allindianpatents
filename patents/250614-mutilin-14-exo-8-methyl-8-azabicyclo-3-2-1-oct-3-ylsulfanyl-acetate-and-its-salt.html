				<td>The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medical therapy, particularly antibacterial therapy.<br>
Pleuromutilin, the compound of formula (A), is a naturally occurring antibiotic which has<br>
antimycoplasmal activity and modest antibacterial activity. It has been shown that the<br>
antimicrobial activity can be improved by replacing the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 by an R-X-CH2CO2- group, where R is an aliphatic or aromatic moiety and X is O, S, or<br>
NR' (H Egger and H Reinshagen, J Antibiotics, 1976,29,923). Tiamulm, the compound<br>
of formula (B), which is used as a veterinary antibiotic, is a derivative of this type<br>
(G Hogenauer in Antibiotics, Vol. V, part 1, ed. F E Hahn, Springer-Verlag, 1979, p 344)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 In this application, the non-conventional numbering system which is generally used in the literature (G Hogenauer, loc cit.) is used.<br>
WO 97/25309 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further modification of the acyloxy group, disclosing 14-0-carbamoyl derivatives of mutilm or 19, 20-dihydromutilin, in which the N-atom of the carbamoyl group is unsubstituted, mono- or di-substituted.<br>
WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives of mutilin or 19, 20-dihydromutilin, in which the N-atom of the carbamoyl group is acylated by a group which includes an azabicyclic moiety<br>
WO 98/14189 (SmithKline Beecham, International Publication Date 9 April 1998) discloses the use of the topical antibacterial agent mupirocm for treating bacterial infections associated with the colonisation of the nasopharynx by pathogenic organisms, in particular, the prophylatic treatment of recurrent sinusistis and recurrent otitis media, especially with novel spray or cream formulations adpated for administration to the<br>
nasopharynx. In addition, Nsouli (Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, January<br>
1996, 76(1), 117) has described a clinical study involving the use of a 0.2% aqueous solution of mupirocin in reducing the attacks of sinusitis.<br>
We have now found that further novel pleuromutilin derivatives have improved antimicrobial properties.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
 in which Y is hydrogen or a removable hydroxy-protecting group, and R1Aand R3A<br>
are R1 and R3 are as defined for formulae (lA) and (IB) or groups convertible to R1 and<br>
R3.<br>
with an active derivative of a carboxylic acid of formula (HI)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 where R2A is R2 as defined for formulae lA and IB or a group convertible to R2, under<br>
ester forming conditions and, where required or desired,<br>
converting Y to hydrogen,<br>
converting an R1A, R2A or R3A group to a R1 , R2 or R3 group, and/or<br>
converting one R1 , R2 or R3 group to another R1 , R2 or R3 group<br>
Conventional methods for ester formation are described in the literature, for example in Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations, Vol. 5, ed. C J Moody, p 123-130, Elsevier Scientific, Oxford, 1995   The active derivative used as an acylating agent may be for example an acid chloride, acid bromide, a mixed anhydride, or an N-acyl-imidazole. The preferred agent is an acid chloride   General methods for fonmng such acylating agents are described in the chemical literature (see IO Sutherland, Comprehensive Organic Chemistry, Vol 2, ed. IO Sutherland, pages 875-883 (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1979), and references therein).<br>
The ester-forming reaction can be carried out in the presence of an organic base, an inorganic base, or an acid   Organic bases include pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, triethylamine, and N,N-dimethylaniline. Inorganic bases include sodium hydride, lithium hydride, potassium carbonate, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, and sodium hexamethyldisilazide   Acids include p-toluenesulphonic acid, benzene sulphonic acid, and sulphunc acid. Optionally, when the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, an acylation catalyst (G Hofle and W Steglich, Synthesis, 1972, 619) such as 4-dimethyamino-pyridine or 4-pyrrolidino-pyridine may also be added to the reaction mixture   Solvents for the ester forming reaction include tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, and chloroform   A preferred solvent is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Useful methods for acylating the 14-hydroxyl in the present invention include the use of the following: acid chloride in N,N-dimethylformamide at elevated temperature (e g 100°C to 120°C); acid chloride in the presence of an organic base (e g. pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, 2,4,6-collidine, di-iso-propylethylamine) or an inorganic base {e.g sodium or lithium hexamethyldisilazide); carboxylic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodumide and an acylation catalyst (e g. 4-dimethylamino-pyridine, 4-pyrrolidino-pyridine); a mutilin 14-chloroformate derivative plus carboxylic acid, tertiary base (e g triethylamine, di-iso-propyl-ethylamine), and an acylation catalyst (e g 4-dimethylamino-pyridine, 4-pyrrolidino-pyridme)<br>
Conversions of an R1A, R2A or R3A group to a R l,R2orR3 group typically arise when a protecting group is needed during the above coupling reaction or during the preparation of<br>
the reactants by the procedures described below. Interconversion of one Rl,R2orR3<br>
group to another typically arises when one compound of formula lA/B is used as the immediate precursor of another compound of formula lA/B or when it is easier to introduce a more complex or reactive substituent at the end of a synthetic sequence<br>
Preferably Y is a hydroxyl protecting group such as an acyl group, for example so that -OY is trifluoroacetyl or dichloroacetyl   When the intended R3 IS also hydroxyl, then R3A is also preferably acyloxy, for example acetyl or dichloroacetyl. Hydroxyl groups at positions 11 and 2 (as groups OY and R3A) may be protected using, for example, dichloroacetic anhydride and pyridine in tetrahydrofuran or N-trifluoroacetyl-imidazole in tetrahydrofuran at 0°C. After the reaction with the derivative of acid III is complete the protecting acyl groups may be removed to restore the hydroxyl groups by hydrolysis e.g. using NaOH in MeOH<br>
It may also be necessary to protect substituent groups in the acid component (HI) prior to reaction with the the compound of formulae (DA) or (IIB), for example protecting N atoms with alkoxycarbonyl, for example f-butoxycarbonyl<br>
Suitable hydroxy, carboxy and amino protecting groups are those well known m the art and which may be removed under conventional conditions and without disrupting the remainder of the molecule. A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which hydroxy, carboxy and ammo groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in for example "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W Greene, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991)   Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organoczirbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl Pzirticularly suitable carboxy protecting groups include alkyl and aryl groups, for instance methyl, ethyl and phenyl. Particularly suitable amino protecting groups include alkoxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl<br>
R1A is typically the R1 group vinyl, and this may be converted to the alternative R1 ethyl group by hydrogenating the vinyl group to form an ethyl group, typically by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e g 10% palladium-on-carbon) m a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
R3A is typically hydrogen or protected hydroxyl, such as acyloxy   After the coupling reaction, protecting acyl groups may be removed to restore the hydroxyl groups by hydrolysis e g. using NaOH in MeOH<br>
Alternatively a compound of formula (lA) in which R3 is hydrogen may be prepared by treating a compound of formula (EC)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 where R1Ais as defined for formulae (IIA) and (IIB),<br>
with an active derivative of the acid of formula (III) under ester forming conditions, and then treating the product with an acid, and, where required or desired,<br>
converting an<br>
R1 A or R2A<br>
group to a R1 or R2 group, and/or converting one R1 or R2 group to another R1 or R2 group.<br>
The acid treatment indicated above converts the epi-mutilin configuration of formula (HC) to the usual mutilin nucleus of formula (DA)   Typically this conversion is carried out by treatment with cone. HCl or Lukas reagent (cone. HCl saturated with ZnCl2) in dioxane<br>
As in formulae (IIA) and (HE), R2A ig typically the R2 group vinyl, and this may be converted to the alternative R2 group by hydrogenating the vinyl group to form an ethyl group   Also It may again be necessary to protect substituent groups in the derivative of acid component (HI) prior to reaction, for example protecting N atoms with , for example, t-butoxycarbonyl<br>
In cases where the intermediate of formula (HA) and (IIB) ( such as Y= acetyl) are used, a base-labile protecting group may conveniently be removed at the same time as the group Y is deprotected. In cases when the intermediate of formula (HC) is used, an acid-labile protecting group may conveniently be removed at the same time as the acid treatment that converts the epi-mutilin configuration into the desired configuration of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formulae (HA), (IIB) and (DC) may be prepared from compounds of formulae (IV) and (V)<br>
 (Formula Removed) <br>
 Suitable compounds as formula (IV) include 11-O-acyl mutilin derivatives, e g mutilin 11-acetate (A J Birch, C W Holzapfel, R W Richards, Tetrahedron (Suppl.), 1966, 8, Part H, 359) or mutilin 11-dichloroacetate or mutilin 11-trifluoroacetate. Formula (V) is (3R)-3-deoxo-1 l-deoxy-3-methoxy-ll-oxo-4-epi-mutilin (H Bemer, G Schulz and H Schneider, Tetrahedron, 1980, 36, 1807)<br>
Compounds (IV) and (V) are effectively the compounds of formula (DA) and (EC) respectively in which R^^ is vinyl and R^A is hydrogen (compound HA). They may be converted into the corresponding compounds in which R^^ is ethyl by hydrogenation, typically by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e.g. 10% palladium-on-carbon) in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Copmpounds of formula (HA) in which R^ A is hydroxyl may be obtained by first preparing 2-hydroxymethylene mutihn from a compound of formula (IV). Using procedures based on that described by A J. Birch, C.W. Holzapfel and R.W. Rickards (Tet (Suppl) 1996 8 part EI 359), a compound of formula (IV) m toluene and methyl formate is treated with sodium methoxide and stirred under argon. The product is a mixture of the desired 2-hydroxymethylene compound and corresponding compounds substituted by formate at position 11 (if OY is OH) and /or position 14. The formate groups may be removed when desired by treatment with potassium hydroxide in methanol.<br>
The product mixture may however be used directly to prepare 2-diazo-mutilin derivatives using the method described by H Bemer, G Schulz, and G Fisher, Monatsh. Chem , 1981, 112, 1441, for example reacting a solution of a 2-hydroxymethylene-mutilin and the formate derivatives in dichloromethane at -10 °C under argon with tosylazide and triethylamme. Removal of the formate groups as described above leaves 2-diazo-mutilin, which may be reacted with a carboxyhc acid to give a 2-acyloxy-mutilin, effectively a compound of formula (HA) in which R^^ is protected hydroxyl   Suitably reaction with dichloroacetic acid gives 2-dichloroacetoxy-mutilin, which can be deprotected as described above to provide 2-OH, preferably after coupling with the derivative of acid (HI)  This reaction produces (25)-2-hydroxy derivatives<br>
Compounds of formula (lEB) are either 1,2-didehydro-mutilin or obtainable therefrom by manipulation of OY and R1A as described above   1,2-Didehydro-mutilins may be prepared using the method described by G Schuiz and H Bemer m Tetrahedron, 1984, 40, 905.<br>
The above described modifications to the mutilin nucleus may also be carried out after coupling of compounds of formula (DA) and (IIC) where R3A is hydrogen {i.e based on mutilin and epi-mutilin) with the active derivative of acid (HI).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing compounds of the invention m which X is O, S, NH, CO.O or CONH which comprises reacting a compound of formula VIA or VIB<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 where Y is hydrogen or a removable hydroxy-protecting group, and R1A and R3A are R1 and R3 as defined for formulae lA and IB or groups convertible to R1 and R3, n is as defined for formulae lA and IB, and RL is a leaving group or OH or NH2, with a compound of formula (VII):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 where R2A is R2 as defined for formulae (lA) and (IB) or a group convertible to R2, and X<br>
and m are as defined for formulae lA and EB, or<br>
when X is CO O with an active derivative of the acid of formula (VII),<br>
by one of the procedures set out below,<br>
and where required or desired<br>
converting Y to hydrogen,<br>
converting an R  lA ,R2AorR3A  group to an R1, R- or R3 group, and/or converting one R1 , R2 or R3 group to another R 1 , R2 or R3 group<br>
where R2A is R2 AS defined for formulae (lA) and (IB) or a group convertible to R2, and X<br>
and m are as defined for formulae lA and EB, or<br>
when X is CO O with an active derivative of the acid of formula (VII),<br>
by one of the procedures set out below,<br>
and where required or desired<br>
converting Y to hydrogen,<br>
converting an R  lA ,R2AorR3A  group to an R1, R- or R3 group, and/or converting one R ^ , R1 or R2 group to another R1 , R3 or R5 group<br><br>
As in the method discussed above starting from compounds (IIA/B/C), preferably Y is a hydroxyl protecting group such as an acyl group, for example so that -OY is trifluoroacetyl or dichloroacetyl. When the intended R3 is also hydroxyl then R3A is also preferably acyloxy, for example acetyl or dichloroacetyl.<br>
It may also be necessary to protect substituent groups in the compound of formula (VII) prior to reaction with the compound (VIA) or (VIB), for example protecting N atoms with alkoxyczirbonyl, for example f-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Suitable hydroxy, carboxy and amino protecting groups are those well known in the art and are discussed above.<br>
R1A is typically the R1 group vinyl, and this may be converted to the alternative R1 ethyl group by hydrogenatmg the vinyl group to form an ethyl group, typically by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e.g 10% palladium-on-carbon) m a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran.<br>

IS typically hydrogen or protected hydroxyl, such as acyloxy. After the coupling<br>
reaction, protecting acyl groups may be removed to restore the hydroxyl groups by<br>
hydrolysis e.g. using NaOH in MeOH<br>
Procedures for coupling the group R (CH2)nCH2CO O- with compond R2A.(CH2)m-XH include the following:<br>
(a)       when RL IS a leaving group, such as 4-MeC6H4S020, MeS020, F3CSO2O, Br or<br>
CI, and X IS O, S or NH.<br>
(I)	where X = O, the alcohol R2-(CH2)m-OH may be converted into the alkoxide by<br>
reaction with an inorganic base, such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, sodium hexamethyldisilazide, or lithium hexamethyldisilazide, in a non-hydroxylic solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, prior to reaction with the compound of formula VIA/B,<br>
(II)	where X = S, the thiol R2-(CH2)ni'SH may be reacted with the compound of formula<br>
VIA/B in the presence of an inorganic base, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide,<br>
sodium hydride, sodium hexamethyldisilazide, or lithium hexamethyldisilazide, in a<br>
solvent such as 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, or<br>
tetrahydrofuran<br>
(ill) where X = NH, the amine R2-(CH2)m-NH2 may be reacted with the compound of<br>
formula VIA/B in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, optionally<br>
in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, pyridine, N,N-di-(iso-propyl)'-<br>
ethylamine, or triethylamine.<br>
(b)	when X is CONH, a compound of formula VIA/B m which RL IS ammo may be<br>
reacted with a compound of formula R2A.-(CH2)in-C02H, or an acylating agent derived<br>
therefrom, using one of the general methods for amide formation that are described in the chemical literature. General methods for amide formation are described by B C Challis and J A Challis m Comprehensive Organic Chemistry, Vol. 2, ed. I O Sutherland, pages 959-964 (Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1979)<br>
(c)	when X is CO.O, a compound of formula VIA/B m which RL is hydroxy may be<br>
reacted with an acylating agent derived from a compound of formula R2A.(CH2)in-C02H,<br>
usmg one of the general methods that are described in the chemical literature, for example treating the acid with oxalyl chloride and reacting with RL = hydroxy in a suitable solvent such as DMF.<br>
Altematively the above reactions may be carried out usmg a compound of formula (VIC).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 where Y and R1A are as defined for formulae IIA and IIB and RL IS as defined for formulae (VIA) and (VIB)<br>
with the compound (VII) by the procedures (a), (b) or (c) set out above, and then<br>
treating the product with an acid, and where required or desired<br>
converting an R1A or   R2A  group to a R1 or R2 group, and/or converting one R1 or R- group to another R1 or R2 group.<br>
As mentioned previously, the acid treatment indicated above converts the epi-mutilin<br>
configuration of formula (VIC) to the usual mutilm nucleus of formula (VIA)  Typically<br>
this conversion is carried out by treatment with cone HCI or Lukas reagent (cone HCl saturated with ZnCl2) in dioxane<br>
As in fomulae (VIA) and (VIB), R1A is typically the R1 group vinyl, and this may be converted to the alternative Rl group by hydrogenating the vinyl group to form an ethyl group. Also it may again be necessary to protect substituent groups in the compound (VII) prior to reaction, for example protecting N atoms with alkoxycarbonyl, for example t-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
The compounds of formulae (VIA), (VIB) and (VIC) may be prepared by reacting the corresponding compounds of formula (HA), (HE) and (EC) by conventional methodology to introduce acyl groups substituted by hydroxyl or amine or a leaving group<br>
Reference is directed to the preparation of the chloride and tosylate by K Riedl m J. Antibiotics, 1976, 29, 132; and the tosylate and mesylate described by H Egger and H Reinshagen in J. Antibiotics, 1976, 29, 915; starting from pleuromutilm or 19,20-dihydro-pleuromutilin (n=0). Also compounds where R   is chloro or bromo may be prepared by reacting Br(CH2)n(CH2)COOCl or Cl(CH2)n(CH2)COOCl with compounds IV and V above. It will be appreciated that when n=0, compounds where R   is hydroxy are pleuromutilm and 19,20-dihydro-pleuromutilin   Compounds where R   is NH2 may be prepared from the compound where R   is a leaving group, for example treating a tosylate with sodium azide, followed by treatment with triphenyl phosphine and a base.<br>
Compounds of formula (lA) wherein X is C ,(0) or SO2 may be obtained by preparing the corresponding compound in which X = S and treating it with an oxidising agent; for example, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in chloroform, or catalytic osmium tetroxide plus N-methylmorpholine iV-oxide in tetrahydrofuran and tertiary-butanol<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to carry out the reaction of the compounds VIA/B/C with compound Vn with the substituents reversed, i.e with -CH2 (CH2)nXH as<br>
a 14-mutilin substituent and R  on the R2A.(CH2)m- residue. For example 22-deoxy-22-sulfanyl-pleuromutilm (US Patent 4130709) may be reacted with a compound of formula R2A.(CH2)ni- R , where R  is a leaving group, such as 4-MeC6H4S020, MeS020, CF3SO2O, or CI, in the presence of an inorganic base, such as sodium methoxide, sodium<br>
ethoxide, or sodium hydride, in a solvent such as 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, or tetrahydrofuran<br>

Preferred compositions of the present invention include those adapted for intranasal administration, in particular, those that will reach into the nasopharynx. Such compositions are preferably adapted for focussed delivery to, and residence within, the nasopharynx. The term Yocussed delivery' is used to mean that the composition is delivered to the nasopharynx, rather than remaining within the nares. The term 'residence' within the nasopharynx is used to mean that the composition, once delivered to the nasopharynx, remains withm the nasopharynx over a course of several hours, rather than being washed away more or less immediately. Preferred compositions include spray compositions and creams. Representative spray compositions include aqueous compositions, as well as oily compositions which contain amphiphihc agents so that the composition increases in viscosity when m contact with moisture. Creams may also be used, especially creams having a rheology that allows the cream to spread readily m the nasopharynx<br>
Preferred aqueous spray compositions include, m addition to water, further excipients including a tonicity modifier such as a salt, for instance sodium chloride; preservative, such as benzalkonium salt; a surfactant such as a non-ionic surfactant, for instance a polysorbate, and buffer, such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate; present m low levels, typically less than 1%. The pH of the composition may also be adjusted, for optimum stability of the drug substance during storage. For compounds of the present invention, a pH in the range 5 to 6, preferably about 5 3 to 5 8, typically about 5.5 is optimal<br>
Representative oily spray and cream compositions are described in WO 98/14189 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Suitably, the drug substance is present in compositions for nasal delivery in between 0 001 and 5%, preferably 0 005 and 3%, by weight of the composition   Suitable amounts include 0.5% and 1% by weight of the composition (for oily compositions and creams) and from 0 01 to 0 2% (aqueous compositions)<br>
Preferably, an aqueous spray composition is used. Such compositions are found to show similar retention in the target area (nasal cavity and nasopharynx) in gamma scintigraphy<br>
studies and have superior release rates in synthetic membrane diffusion studies when<br>
compared to an oily composition as described in WO 98/14189.   In addition, an aqueous base was found to be prefered to an oily base in sensory analysis studies.<br>
Spray compositions according to the present invention may be delivered to the nasal cavity by spray devices well known in the art for nasal sprays, for instance an air lift pump Prefrrred devices include those which are metered to provide a unit volume of composition, prefereably about 100µl, and optionally adpated for nasal administration by addition of a modified nozzle.<br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Example 1 - Oily Spray Formulation<br>
A carrier for a nasal spray formulation was prepared by forming a blend of 67% w/w fractionated coconut oil (medium chain length)* and 33% w/w of glyceryl mono-oleate **. To this blend was added 0 2% w/w of powdered lemon juice flavour, followed by 0.5 or 1.0% w/w of drug substance (either in solution or, if insoluble, micronized)***.<br>
The resultant formulation has a viscosity which is sprayable at 20°C or above. When sprayed into the nose of a patient, the liquid coats the nasal passages and contact with moisture mside the nose (from the mucous membranes, and the humid environment generally) causes the carrier to thicken. This prolongs the residence time of the sprayed formulation on the nasal surfaces. A spray volume of about 100 µl contains approximately 0.5 or Img of drug substance<br>
