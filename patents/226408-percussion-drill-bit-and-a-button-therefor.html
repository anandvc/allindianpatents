				<td>PERCUSSION DRILL BIT AND A BUTTON THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a percussion drill bit for drilling bores in rock. A typical<br>
percussion drill bit comprises a steel drill body, means at one end of the drill body for<br>
connecting the bit to a percussive unit such as a drill string for a jack hammer or a down-the-<br>
hole hammer, and a plurality of buttons embedded in the other end of the drill body. The<br>
present invention also relates to a regrindable button for use in said drill bit.<br>
Each button comprises a cemented carbide body having a rear mounting portion embedded in<br>
the drill body and a front end protruding from the drill body.<br>
Known drill bits that are provided with non-enhanced cemented carbide buttons such as<br>
disclosed in EP-B1-886 715 have disadvantages in thai they wear prematurely and have slow<br>
penetration rates. Furthermore regrinding of conventional buttons becomes unstable. Other<br>
known drill bits are shown in US-A-3,788, 409 and US-A-6,220, 376.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a drill bit for percussive drilling, wherein the<br>
life of the bit is extended.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a drill bit for percussive drilling with an<br>
increased penetration rate.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a regrindable cemented carbide<br>
button for percussive drilling, which makes the pressing tool more durable.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a regrindable cemented carbide<br>
button for percussive drilling, which button can be reground in a stable manner.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
In Figs. lA and 1 B a rock drill bit is shown, which in a usual manner comprises a body and<br>
cemented carbide buttons. The body comprises a substantially cylindrical head portion 1 and a<br>
more slender shaft 2. The body of the drill bit is made of steel.<br>
The head portion 1 comprises a front surface or a front side designated with 3, in which a<br>
number of buttons are mounted. The front surface may be substantially planar. A first surface<br>
portion 6, located between the front surface 3 and the periphery of the head portion, is<br>
conically shaped. On this conical surface 6 are provided a number of first buttons or gauge<br>
row buttons 7 forming a peripheral ring on the head portion. The buttons 7 in this case project<br>
somewhat outside the periphery of the head portion in order to machine a hole during drilling<br>
which has a somewhat bigger diameter than the very head portion. Chipways or recesses 8 are<br>
provided in areas between adjacent peripheral buttons 7, through which flush medium can<br>
pass. A number of front buttons are provided also in the area located inside the peripheral<br>
buttons 7, which depending on their position, are designated by numerals 9 and 10,<br><br>
respectively. The rock drill bit is to be coupled to a drill tube or a drill rod in a drill string by<br>
means of a threaded connection, not shown, or to a driver sub of a down-the-hole hammer, not<br>
shown, so as to transfer rotational movement in the usual manner. The tube or rod includes a<br>
channel for conveying a flush medium.<br>
A main channel 11 for flush medium is provided inside the drill bit. This main channel<br>
communicates at its forward end with a number of branch channels 12, which terminate in<br>
recesses 4 in the front surface 3 and in return grooves 5. In this connection it may be noted<br>
that one or more flush medium channels also can terminate in the chipways 8. The flush<br>
medium will in practice be water or air.<br>
A number of un-coated buttons 7,9 and 10 is provided in the conical surface 6 and in the front<br>
surface 3 of the drill body. The buttons are completely made of cemented carbide and secured<br>
in borings preferably by press fit. A number of buttons 7 is positioned at the periphery of the<br>
bit 10, the radially outer portions of which define the diameter of the bit and thus the diameter<br>
of the bore being drilled.<br>
At least each row button 7 when mounted projects a maximum distance L2 from the<br>
associated rim surface 23 of the bit body 2 (Fig. 2). The distance L2 is large in comparison<br>
with the prior art button as shown as a dashed line in Fig. 2., i. e. about 53% of the button<br>
diameter D to compare with 49% for the prior art button. In other words in accordance with<br>
the present invention the distance L2 is not less than 50 % of the button diameter D.<br>
preferably it's not less than 52%.<br>
The buttons 7 are tilted in such a way, that a longitudinal centerline (center axis) CL2 of each<br>
button 7 diverges by a preferably acute angle from the longitudinal center axis CLl of the<br>
drill bit in a forward direction of the bit.<br>
All buttons 7,9 and 10 are embedded in the front surface of the drill body. Each button<br>
comprises a non-enhanced cemented carbide body having a cylindrical grip or mounting<br>
portion 20 embedded in the drill body and a front converging end protruding from the drill<br>
body. A radius Rl defines the envelope surface 25 of the mounting portion 20. The<br><br>
converging end of each cemented carbide button defines the cutting end 18 of the button.<br>
The surface 18A of the cutting end 18 starts from an edge 22 substantially lying in a<br>
plane P, see Fig. 2. The edge 22 is preferably disposed at a junction between a conical<br>
intermediate surface 21 of the cemented carbide button, and the cylindrical envelope<br>
surface 25. The conical intermediate surface 21 forms in the cross-section of Fig. 2 an<br>
acute angle a of about 13-19°, preferably about 15° with the envelope surface 25 of the<br>
rear mounting portion 20. The conical intermediate surface is there for pressing reasons<br>
when compacting the carbide and binder powder which makes the upper or lower punch<br>
in the pressing tool more durable. The edge 22 is parallel with the associated rim surface<br>
23 and they are spaced by the distance L1, which is in the magnitude of 0.5 to 2 mm.<br>
The longitudinal centerline CLl of the drill bit and the longitudinal centerline CL2 of the<br>
buttons 7 include an angle therebetween. The angle is in the range of about 13°-163°,<br>
preferably 20°-55°.<br>
The surface 18 A of the cutting end 18 of the button is substantially semi- spherically<br>
curved and defined by a radius R2 lying on the center axis CL2, and the origin C of the<br>
radius R2 is positioned axially rearwardly of the plane P. The plane P intersects the center<br>
axis CL2 at a point. The distance A between said point and the radius origin C is 5 to<br>
10% of the radius Rl. The radius R2 is about 85 % to 115 % of the radius Rl of the rear<br>
mounting portion 20.<br>
Since the radius R2 of the semi-spherical cemented carbide front end is smaller than<br>
hitherto known buttons the new inventive drill bit will drill longer than prior art drill bits<br>
before regrinding is needed, i. e. there is be more cemented carbide in the cutting end 18<br>
of the inventive cemented carbide button (compare the dashed line in Fig. 2).<br>
Furthermore, the drill bit will achieve an increased penetration rate due to the higher<br>
contact pressure that each button exerts on the rock surface in the borehole. In addition,<br>
the inventive cemented carbide button can be reground in a stable manner since the<br><br>
button projects from the steel bit body more than usual and thus the grinding recess of a<br>
grinding cup will be made deeper than previous cups. The grinding cup will thus have a<br>
substantially semi-spherical recess adapted to grind the button, which recess has a depth<br>
which is not less than 50 % of the largest diameter of the recess and preferably not less<br>
than 52%. The radius of the semi- spherical recess is about 85 % to 115 % of the radius<br>
Rl of the rear mounting portion 20. With the term "regrindable" is here meant that a<br>
single grinding cup rotating and orbiting on the button end can substantially restore the<br>
original shape of the button end.<br>
Tests have shown that during percussive drilling the duration of life of the inventive bit<br>
was twice the life of conventional bits. The diameters of the buttons of said inventive bits<br>
were chosen such that the largest buttons 7 were located at the periphery and the inner<br>
buttons 9 were smaller while the innermost buttons 10 were smallest in diameter. The<br>
projections from the rim surfaces 23 varied in a similar way, i. e. from 9.4 mm to 8.6 mm<br>
and 7.6 mm, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the shape of the button according to the present invention gives a freedom<br>
for the drill bit designer in that the present button can be mounted in the drill bit at an<br>
inclination angle within an interval of about 150° starting from about 13° relative to the<br>
bit axis CLl.<br>
The geometry of the button according to the present invention provides numerous<br>
advantages as compared with prior buttons such as extended life, increased penetration<br>
rate and stable regrinding.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additions,<br>
deletions, modifications, and substitutions not specifically described may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended<br>
claims.<br><br>
