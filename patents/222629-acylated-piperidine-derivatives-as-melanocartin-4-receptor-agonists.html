TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
ACYLATED   PIPERIDINE   DERIVATIVES   AS   MELANOCORTIN-4<br>
RECEPTOR AGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to acylated piperidine derivatives, their synthesis, and their use as melanocortin receptor (MC-R) agonists. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are selective agonists of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC-4R) and are thereby useful for the treatment of disorders responsive to the activation of MC-4R, such as obesity, diabetes, male sexual dysfunction, and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides are known to affect food intake. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the melanocortin receptor (MC-R) family, several of which are expressed in the brain, are the targets of POMC derived peptides involved in the control of food intake and metabolism. A specific single MC-R that may be targeted for the control of obesity has not yet been identified, although evidence has been presented that MC-4R signalling is important in mediating feed behavior (S.Q. Giraudo et ah, "Feeding effects of hypothalamic injection of melanocortin-4 receptor ligands," Brain Research, 80: 302-306 (1998)).<br>
Evidence for the involvement of MC-R's in obesity includes: i) the agouti (Avy) mouse which ectopically expresses an antagonist of the MC-IR, MC-3R and -4R is obese, indicating that blocking the action of these three MC-R's can lead to hyperphagia and metabolic disorders; ii) MC-4R knockout mice (D. Huszar et al.. Cell, 88: 131-141 (1997)) recapitulate the phenotypc of the agouti mouse and these mice are obese; iii) the cyclic heptapeptide MT-II (a non-selective MC-IR, -3R, -4R, and -5R agonist) injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) in rodents, reduces food intake in several animal feeding models (NPY, ob/ob, agouti, fasted) while ICV injected SHU-9119 (MC-3R and 4R antagonist; MC-IR and -5R agonist) reverses this effect and can induce hyperphagia; iv) chronic intraperitoneal treatment of Zucker fatty rats with an a-NDP-MSH derivative (HP228) has been reported to activate MC-IR, -3R, -4R, and -5R and to attenuate food intake and body weight gain over a 12-week period (I. Corcos et al., 'HP228 is a potent<br><br>
agonist of melanocortin receptor-4 and significantly attenuates obesity and diabetes in Zucker fatty rats/' Society for Neuroscience Abstracts, 23: 673 (1997)).<br>
Five distinct MC-R's have thus far been identified, and these are expressed in different tissues. MC-IR was initially characterized by dominant gain of function mutations at the Extension locus, affecting coat color by controlling phaeomelanin to eumelanin conversion through control of tyrosinase. MC-IR is mainly expressed in melanocytes. MC-2R is expressed in the adrenal gland and represents the ACTH receptor. MC-3R is expressed in the brain, gut, and placenta and may be involved in the control of food intake and thermogenesis. MC-4R is uniquely expressed in the brain, and its inactivation was shown to cause obesity (A, Kask, et al., "Selective antagonist for the melanocortin-4 receptor (HS014) increases food intake in free-feeding rats," Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245: 90-93 (1998)). MC-5R is expressed in many tissues, including white fat, placenta and exocrine glands. A low level of expression is also observed in the brain. MC-5R knockout mice reveal reduced sebaceous gland lipid production (Chen et al., Cell, 91: 789-798 (1997)).<br>
Erectile dysfunction denotes the medical condition of inability to achieve penile erection sufficient for successful sexual intercourse. The term "impotence" is oftentimes employed to describe this prevalent condition. Approximately 140 million men worldwide, and, according to a National Institutes of Health study, about 30 million American men suffer from impotcncy or erectile dysfunction. It has been estimated that the latter number could rise to 47 million men by the year 2000. Erectile dysfunction can arise from either organic or psychogenic causes, with about 20% of such cases being purely psychogenic in origin. Erectile dysfunction increases from 40% at age 40, to 67% at age 75, with over 75% occurring in men over the age of 50. In spite of the frequent occurrence of this condition, only a small number of patients have received treatment because existing treatment alternatives, such as injection therapies, penile prosthesis implantation, and vacuum pumps, have been uniformly disagreeable [for a discussion, see "ABC of sexual health - erectile dysfunction," Brit. Med. J. 318: 387-390 (1999)]. Only more recently have more viable treatment modalities become available, in particular orally active agents, such as sildenafil citrate, marketed by Pfizer under the brand name of ViagraÂ®. (See "Emerging pharmacological therapies for erectile dysfunction," Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 9: 1689-1696(1999)). Sildenafil is a selective inhibitor of type V phosphodiesterase (PDE-V), a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase isozyme [see R.B. Moreland et al., "Sildenafil: A Novel Inhibitor of Phosphodiesterase Type 5 in Human Corpus Cavernosum Smooth Muscle Cells," Life Sci., 62: 309-318 (1998)]. Prior to the<br><br>
introduction of Viagra on the market, less than 10% of patients suffering from erectile dysfunction received treatment. Sildenafil is also being evaluated in the clinic for the treatment, of female sexual dysfunction.<br>
The regulatory approval of ViagraÂ® for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction has invigorated efforts to discover even more effective methods to treat erectile dysfunction. Several additional selective PDE-V inhibitors are in clinical trials. UK-114542 is a sildenafil backup from Pfizer with supposedly improved properties. Tadalafil or IC-351 (ICOS Corp.) is claimed to have greater selectivity for PDE-V over PDE-VI than sildenafil. Other PDE-V inhibitors include vardenafil from Bayer, M-54033 and M-54018 from Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., and E-4010 from Eisai Co., Ltd.<br>
Other pharmacological approaches to the treatment of erectile dysfunction have been described [see, e.g., "Latest Findings on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction," Drug News &amp; Perspectives, 9: 572-575 (1996); "Oral Pharmacotherapy in Erectile Dysfunction," Current Opinion in Urology, 7: 349-353 (1997)]. A product under clinical development by Zonagen is an oral formulation of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine mesylate under the brand name of VasomaxÂ®. VasomaxÂ® is also being evaluated for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction.<br>
Drugs to treat erectile dysfunction act either peripherally or centrally. They are also classified according to whether they "initiate" a sexual response or "facilitate" a sexual response to prior stimulation [for a discussion, see "A Therapeutic Taxonomy of Treatments for Erectile Dysfunction: An Evolutionary hnperative," Int. J. Impotence Res., 9: 115-121 (1997)]. While sildenafil and phentolamine act peripherally and are considered to be "enhancers" or "facilitators" of the sexual response to erotic stimulation, sildenafil appears to be efficacious in both mild organic and psychogenic erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil has an onset of action of 30-60 minutes after an oral dose with the effect lasting about 4 hours, whereas phentolamine requires 5-30 minutes for onset with a duration of 2 hours. Although sildenafil is effective in a majority of patients, it takes a relatively long time for the compound to show the desired effects. The faster-acting phentolamine appears to be less effective and to have a shorter duration of action than sildenafil. Oral sildenafil is effective in about 70% of men who take it, whereas an adequate response with phentolamine is observed in only 35-40% of patients. Both compounds require erotic stimulation for efficacy. Since sildenafil indirectly increases blood flow in the systemic circulation by enhancing the smooth muscle relaxation effects of nitric oxide, it is contraindicated for patients with unstable heart conditions or<br><br>
cardiovascular disease, in particular patients taking nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, to treat<br>
angina. Other adverse effects associated with the clinical use of sildenafil include<br>
headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and "abnormal vision," the latter the result of inhibition of<br>
the type VI phosphodiesterase isozyme (PDE-VI), a cyclic-GMP-specific<br>
phosphodiesterase that is concentrated in the retina. "Abnormal vision" is defined as a<br>
mild and transient "bluish" tinge to vision, but also an increased sensitivity to light or<br>
blurred vision.<br>
Synthetic melanocortin receptor agonists (melanotropic peptides) have<br>
been found to initiate erections in men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction [Sec H.<br>
Wessells et al.. "Synthetic. Melanotropic Peptide Initiates Erections in Men With<br>
Psychogenic Erectile Dysfunction: Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Crossover Study,"<br>
J. UroL. 160: 389-393 (1998); Fifteenth American Peptide Symposium. June 14-19, 1997<br>
(Nashville TN)]. Activation of melanocortin receptors of the brain appears to cause<br>
normal stimulation of sexual arousal. In the above study, the centrally acting a-<br>
mclanocyte-stimulating hormone analog, melanotan-II (MT-II), exhibited a 75% response<br>
rate, similar to results obtained with apomorphine, when injected intramuscularly or<br>
subcutaneously to males with psychogenic erectile dysfunction. MT-II is a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide, Ac-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH2, v^hich contains the 4-<br>
10 melanocortin receptor binding region common to a-MSH and adrenocorticotropin, but with a lactam bridge. It is a non-selective MC-IR, -3R, -4R, and -5R agonist (DOIT et ah, Life Sciences. Vol. 58, 1777-1784, 1996). MT-II (also referred to as PT-14) (ErectideÂ®) is presently in clinical development by Palatin Technologies, Inc. and TheraTech, Inc. as a non-penile subcutaneous injection formulation. It is considered to be an "initiator" of the sexual response. The time to onset of erection with this drug is relatively short (10-20 minutes) with a duration of action approximately 2.5 hours. Adverse reactions observed with MT-II include nausea, flushing, loss of appetite, stretching, and yawning and may be the result of activation of MC-IR, MC-2R, MC-3R, and/or MC-5R. MT-II must be administered parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intramuscular route, since it is not absorbed into the systemic circulation when given by the oral route.<br>
MT-II's erectogenic properties apparently are not limited to cases of psychogenic erectile dysfunction in that men with a variety of organic risk factors developed penile erections upon subcutaneous injection of the compound; moreover, the level of sexual desire was significantly higher after MT-II administration than after placebo [see H. Wessells, "Effect of an Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone Analog<br><br>
on Penile Erection and Sexual Desire in Men with Organic Erectile Dysfunction," Urology, 56: 641-646 (2000)].<br>
Compositions of melanotropic peptides and methods for the treatment of psychogenic erectile dysfunction are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,576,290, assigned to Competitive Technologies. Methods of stimulating sexual response in females using melanotropic peptides have been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,051,555.<br>
Spiropiperidine and piperidine derivatives have been disclosed in WO 99/64002 (16 December 1999); WO 00/74679 (14 December 2000); WO 01/70708 (27 September 2001); WO 01/70337 (27 September 2001); and WO 01/91752 (6 December 2001) as agonists of the melanocortin receptor(s) and particularly as selective agonists of the MC-4R receptor and thereby useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
Because of the unresolved deficiencies of the various pharmacological agents discussed above, there is a continuing need in the medical arts for improved methods and compositions to treat individuals suffering from psychogenic and/or organic sexual dysfunction. Such methods should have wider applicability, enhanced convenience and ease of compliance, short onset of action, reasonably long duration of action, and minimal side effects with few contraindications, as compared to agents now available.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide acylated piperidine derivatives which are melanocortin receptor agonists and thereby useful to treat obesity, diabetes, male sexual dysfunction, and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide acylated piperidine derivatives which are selective agonists of the melanocortin-4 (MC-4R) receptor.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising the melanocortin receptor agonists of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for the treatment or prevention of disorders, diseases, or conditions responsive to the activation of the melanocortin-4 receptor in a mammal in need thereof by administering the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for the treatment or prevention of obesity, diabetes mellitus, male sexual dysfunction, and female sexual dysfunction by administering the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention to a mammal in need thereof<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for the Ireatment of erectile dysfunction by administering the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention to a mammal in need thereof<br>

Such diseases, disorders or conditions include, but are not limited to, obesity (by reducing appetite, increasing metabolic rate, reducing fat intake or reducing carbohydrate craving), diabetes mellitus (by enhancing glucose tolerance, decreasing insulin resistance), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, cancer, gall bladder disease, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, compulsion, neuroses, insomnia/sleep disorder, substance abuse, pain, male and female sexual dysfunction (including impotence, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction), fever, inflammation, immunemodulation, rheumatoid arthritis, skin tanning, acne and other skin disorders, neuroprotective and cognitive and memory enhancement including the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Some compounds encompassed by formula I show highly selective affinity for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC-4R) relative to MC-IR, MC-2R, MC-3R, and MC-5R, which makes them especially useful in the prevention and<br><br>
treatment of obesity, as well as male and/or female sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction.<br>
"Male sexual dysfunction" includes impotence, loss of libido, and erectile (lysfunclion.<br>
'lirectile dysfunction' is a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve erection, ejaculation, or both. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction and sexual dysfunction can have numerous underlying causes, including but not limited to (1) aging, (b) an underlying physical dysfunction, such as trauma, surgery, and peripheral vascular disease, and (3) side-effects resulting Irom drug treatment, depression, and other CNS disorders.<br>
"Female sexual dysfunction" can be seen as resulting from multiple components including dysfunction in desire, sexual arousal, sexual receptivity, and orgasm related to disturbances in the clitoris, vagina, periurethral glans, and other trigger points of sexual function. In particular, anatomic and functional modification of such trigger points may diminish the orgasmic potential in breast cancer and gynecologic cancer patients. Treatment of female sexual dysfunction with an MC-4 receptor agonist can result in improved blood flow, improved lubrication, improved sensation, facilitation of reaching orgasm, reduction in the refractory period between orgasms, and improvements in arousal and desire. In a broader sense, "female sexual dysfunction" also incorporates sexual pain, premature labor, and dysmenorrhea.<br>

usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously.employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray. The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials, of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both, A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation<br><br>
of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>

The compounds of structural formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Schemes and Examples, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the following specific examples. Moreover, by utilizing the procedures described in detail in PCT International Application Publications WO 99/64002 (16 December 1999) and WO 00/74679 (14 December 2000), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, in conjunction with the disclosure contained herein, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily prepare additional compounds of the present invention claimed herein. The compounds illustrated in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention. The Examples further illustrate details for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compounds. The instant compounds are generally isolated in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as those described previously hereinabove. The free amine bases corresponding to the isolated salts can be generated by neutralization with a suitable base, such as aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide, and extraction of the liberated amine free base into an organic solvent followed by evaporation. The amine free base isolated in this manner can be further converted into another pharmaceutically acceptable salt by dissolution in an organic solvent followed by addition of the appropriate acid and subsequent evaporation, precipitation, or crystallization. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted. Mass spectra (MS) were measured by electron-spray ion-mass spectroscopy.<br>
The phrase "standard peptide coupling reaction conditions" means coupling a carboxylic acid with an amine using an acid activating agent such as EDC, DCC, and BOP in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a catalyst such as<br><br>
HOBT. The use of protecting groups for the amine and carboxylic acid functionalities to facilitate the desired reaction and minimize undesired reactions is well documented. Conditions required to remove protecting groups are found in standard textbooks such as Greene, T, and Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 1991. CBZ and BOC are commonly used protecting groups in organic synthesis, and their removal conditions are known to thos6 skilled in the art. For example, CBZ may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal or its oxide such as palladium on activated carbon in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In cases where catalytic hydrogenation is contraindicated due to the presence of other potentially reactive functionalities, removal of CBZ groups can also be achieved by treatment with a solution of hydrogen bromide in acetic acid or by treatment with a mixture of TFA and dimethylsulfide. Removal of BOC protecting groups is carried out with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or hydrogen chloride gas, in a solvent such as methylene chloride, methanol, or ethyl acetate.<br>

Reaction Schemes A-L illustrate the methods employed in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention of structural formula I. All substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Reaction Scheme A illustrates a key step in the synthesis of the novel compounds of structural formula I of the present invention. As shown in reaction Scheme A, the reaction of a 4-substituted piperidine or 4-substituted tetrahydropyridine of type 1 with a carboxylic acid derivative of formula 2 affords a title compound of structural formula I. The amide bond coupling reaction illustrated in reaction Scheme A is conducted in an appropriate inert solvent such as dimethylformamide (OMF), methylene chloride or the like and may be performed with a variety of reagents suitable for amide coupling reactions such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3&gt;3-tetramethyluronium<br><br>
hexafluorophosphate (HATU), l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or benzotriazol-l-yloxytripyrrolidinephosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP). Preferred conditions for the amide bond coupUng reaction shown in reaction Scheme A are known to those skilled in organic synthesis. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, the use of basic reagents such as triethylamine (TEA) or N-methylmorpholine (NMM), or the addition of an additive such as l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) or l-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt). Alternatively, 4-substituted piperidines or 4-substituted tetrahydropyridines of formula 1 may be treated with an active ester or acid chloride derived from carboxylic acid 2 which also affords compounds of structural formula I. The amide bond coupling shown in reaction Scheme A is usually conducted at temperatures between 0Â°C and room temperature, occasionally at elevated temperatures, and the coupling reaction is typically conducted for periods of 1 to 24 hours.<br>
When 1 is a 4-substituted tetrahydropyridine, the amide coupling product can be reduced to form the corresponding piperidine derivative (I) by hydrogenation in a solvent such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid or mixtures thereof using a noble metal catalyst on carbon such as platinum (IV) oxide, palladium-on-carbon, or palladium hydroxide.<br>
If it is desired to produce a compound of structural formula I wherein Rlis a hydrogen, the N-BOC protected analogs of structural formula I may be used in the synthesis and deprotected under acidic conditions, for instance using trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent like methylene chloride or hydrogen chloride in a solvent such as ethyl acetate at room temperature.<br>
When it is desired to prepare compounds of structural formula I wherein R1 is not a hydrogen, the compounds of general formula I (Rl = H) may be further modified using the methodology described below in reaction Scheme M.<br><br><br>
Reaction Schemes B-I illustrate methods for the synthesis of the carboxylic acids of general formula 2 that are utilized in the amide bond couphng reaction shown in reaction Scheme A. Reaction Schemes J-L illustrate additional methods for the synthesis of 4-substituted piperidines of general formula! that are used in that same step.<br>
Reaction Scheme B illustrates a preferred method for the synthesis of compounds of general formula 2 wherein r is 2 and s is 1 such that the resulting heterocycle is a 3-aryl-4-piperidine carboxylic acid derivative 10. The synthesis of 10 begins with a commercially available P-keto ester such as 2. Generally a protecting group interchange of an N-BOC group for the N-benzyl group is performed initially. Thus a (3-keto ester of formula 3. is subjected to debenzylation by hydrogenolysis using a palladium-on-carbon catalyst in a solvent system such as 1:1 ethanol-water under a hydrogen atmosphere. The resulting piperidone 4 is then protected as its tert-butyl carbamate using BOC anhydride in the presence of a base and a suitable solvent. For example, this can be accomplished in a two phase mixture of chloroform and aqueous sodium bicarbonate as shown. Incorporation of the 3-aryl substiluent is then performed in two steps. First, the P-keto ester group is converted to the corresponding vinyl triflate 6 using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and an organic base like //,//-diisopropylethy]amine in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting vinyl triflate 6 is then subjected to a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with an aryl boronic acid (7) using a palladium (II) catalyst such as [l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)-fcrrocene]dichloropalladium(II). Preferred conditions for this reaction are the use of a<br><br>
toluene-elhanol-aqueous sodium carboncite solvent system at an elevated temperature, for instance 50-100Â°C, for a period of 2-24 hours. The resulting aryl-substituted tetrahydropyridine derivative 8 can be reduced to a piperidine such as 9 using a variety of known techniques and the method chosen will determine the stereochemical outcome of the product. For instance, hydrogenation of 8 with a palladium on carbon catalyst in a solvent such as ethanol affords cis-3,4-disubstituted piperidines of general formula 9. Alternatively, a dissolving metal reduction using a metal, such as magnesium in methanol, reduces the double bond of 8 and produces a mixture of both cis and trans 3,4-disubstiluted piperidines of formula 9. The resulting mixture of cis and trans diastereoisomers may be separated chromatographically or it may be subsequently epimerized to afford the pure trans isomer of 9 by treating the mixture with a base like sodium methoxide in methanol. Finally, hydrolysis of either the cis or trans 3-aryl-4-piperidine carboxylic ester 9 affords either a cis or trans 3-aryl-4-piperidine carboxylic acid of general formula 10, corresponding to an acid of general formula 2 wherein r is 2 and s is I. The cis or trans carboxylic acids of general formula J_0 are produced as racemates and cither may be resolved to afford enantiomerically pure compounds by methods known in organic synthesis. Preferred methods include resolution by crystallization of diastereoisomeric salts derived from acids J_0 and a chiral amine base or the use of chiral stationary phase liquid chromatography columns.<br><br><br><br>
Reaction Scheme C illustrates a preferred method for the synthesis of compounds of general formula 2 wherein r is 1 and s is 2, such that the resulting heterocycle is a 4-aryl-3-piperidine-carboxylic acid derivative JJZ. The synthesis of JJ7 is similar to the one shown in reaction Scheme B, and may begin with either of the commercially available P-keto esters J_l or 12. Conversion of one of these starting materials to the N-BOC-protected piperidine 13 is performed as shown and the resulting P-keto ester is subjected to the two-step arylation protocol previously described to yield 15. Reduction of the double bond of 15 using conditions appropriate for obtaining either cis or trans 17 is followed by ester hydrolysis which affords either a cis or trans 4-aryl-3-piperidine-carboxylic acid of general formula 17 which corresponds to an acid of general formula 2 wherein r is 1 and s is 2. The cis or trans carboxylic acids of general formula V]_ are produced as racemates and either may be resolved to afford enantiomerically pure compounds by methods known in organic synthesis. Preferred methods include resolution by crystallization of diastereoisomeric salts derived from the acids 17_ and a chiral amine base or by the use of chiral stationary phase liquid chromatography columns.<br><br><br>
The synthesis of the N-BOC protected carboxylic acids of general formula 10 and _17 illustrated in reaction Schemes B and C are useful for the preparation of title compounds of structural formula I bearing a variety of Rl substituents as noted above. For the synthesis of certain title compounds of structural formula I, for instance when it is desired that Rl be a (ert-buiyl group, it is preferable to incorporate that Rl substituent at an earlier stage of the synthesis. The synthesis of a l-substituted-3-ketopiperidine-4-carboxylic ester (21) is shown in reaction Scheme D. A primary amine 18 bearing a<br><br>
desired Rl substituent like a teri-huiyl group is reacted with ethyl 4-bromobutyrate at elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent to afford the N-substituled ethyl 4-aminobutyiate 19. The amino ester J_9 is then alkylated a second time with ethyl bromoacctate in a high boiling inert solvent such as toluene and in the presence of a base such as powdered potassium carbonate. The resulting aminodiesters of general formula 20 are then cyclized using an intramolecular Dieckmann reaction to afford piperidines such as 21. The Dieckmann reaction is performed using a strong base such as potassium /^r^butoxide or the like, in an aprotic solvent such as THF at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent. The resulting l-substituted-3-ketopiperidine-4-carboxylic ester 21 corresponds to a compound of general formula 5 shown in reaction Scheme B, where the BOC group is replaced with the desired Rl substituent. The compounds of general formula 21 may then be converted to compounds of general formula 2 where the Rl substituent replaces the BOC group using the reaction sequence illustrated in reaction Scheme B.<br><br>
When it is desirable to synthesize a compound of general formula 12 wherein the BOC group is replaced with a substituent group Rl, a reaction sequence similar to the one illustrated in reaction Scheme C may be employed as shown in reaction Scheme E. An amine 18 bearing the desired Rl substituent is first subjected to a Michael addition with excess ethyl acrylate in the presence of a solvent such as THF or ethanol. The resulting diester 22 is then converted to a l-substituted-4-ketopiperidine-3-carboxy[ic ester 21 using an intramolecular Dieckmann reaction under conditions similar to those illustrated in reaction Scheme C. The substituted piperidine 23 corresponds to a compound of general formula 13 shown in reaction Scheme C, wherein the BOC group is replaced with the desired Rl substituent. The compounds of general formula 23 may then be converted to compounds of general formula 2 where the Rl substituent replaces the BOC group using the methodology illustrated in reaction Scheme C.<br><br><br>
Reaction Scheme F illustrates a strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula 2 when the values of r and s are selected such that the resulting heterocycle is a 3-aryl-4-pyrrolidine carboxylic acid derivative (29). The preferred method for the synthesis of compounds of general formula 29 involves the azomethine ylid 3+2 cycloaddition reaction of an azomethine ylid precursor of general formula 25 and a substituted cinnamic ester 24. The azomethine cycloaddition reaction of 24 and 25 affords the 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidine 26, and the stereochemical relationship of the substituents on the newly formed pyrrolidine ring is determined by the stereochemistry of the double bond in the cinnamate ester 24. Thus the trans ester 24 affords a irans 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidine of formula 26 as shown. The con-esponding cis cinnamate ester affords a cis 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidine of general formula 26. Cis or trans 3-arylpyrrolidine-4-carboxylic esters of general formula 26 may be resolved to afford enantiomerically pure compounds using a method such as resolution by crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts derived from 26 and a chiral carboxylic acid, or directly by the use of chiral stationary phase liquid chromatography columns. Reaction Scheme F illustrates the case where a trans cinnamic ester 24 is converted to a trans 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidine 26 and its subsequent resolution affords the enantiomerically pure trans pyrrolidine esters 27 and 28. Finally, the esters of general formula 26 (or their pure enantiomers 27 and 28) are hydrolyzed to the corresponding amino acid hydrochlorides of general formula 29 as shown at the bottom of reaction Scheme F.<br>
Amino acids of general formula 29 are zwitterionic. Therefore it is in some cases difficult to achieve efficient separation and purification of these compounds from aqueous reactions or workups. In these cases it is preferred to effect the hydrolysis using a reagent such potassium trimethylsilanolate in diethyl ether. Under these conditions the potassium salt of the carboxylic acid is produced which affords an easily isolated<br><br>
precipitate in ether. The resulting salt is then converted to the corresponding amino acid hydrochloride by treatment with excess hydrogen chloride in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. Alternatively, esters such as 26 may be converted directly to the amino acid hydrochlorides 29 under acidic hydrolysis conditions. The hydrolysis of the ester 26 is achieved by prolonged reaction with concentrated hydrochloric acid at an elevated temperature. For example, this reaction may be conducted in 8 M hydrochloric acid at reflux overnight. The reaction mixture is then cooled and evaporated in vacuo to afford the amino acid hydrochloride 29. The amino acid hydrochlorides of general formula 29 correspond to an amino acid hydrochloride of general formula 2 wherein both r and s are 1 and may be employed directly in the amide bond coupling step illustrated in reaction Scheme A to produce the compounds of the present invention of structural formula I.<br><br><br>
with a chiral auxilliary such as (S)-(-)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (30). The ticylation of chiral auxiliary 30 with cinnamic acids of formula 29 is performed by initial activation of the acid to afford a mixed anhydride. Typically acids of general formula 29 are reacted with an acid chloride such as pivaloyl chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and in a suitable aprotic solvent such as THF. The intermediate cinnamyl-pivaloyl anhydride is converted to the product 31 by reaction with the oxazolidinone 30 in the presence of lithium chloride, an amine base such as triethylamine and in a solvent such as THF, and the reaction is conducted at temperatures between -20Â°C and room temperature for periods of 1-24 hours. Alternatively, the oxazolidinone 30 may be deprotonated with a strong base such as n-butyllithium in THF at low temperatures such as -78Â°C and then reacted with a mixed anhydride obtained from acid 29 and an acid chloride like pivaloyl chloride as noted above. The cinnamyl oxazolidinone of general formula 3i, which is produced by either of these methods, is then reacted with the azomethine ylid precursor 25 in' a manner similar to that described in reaction Scheme F, and the products of the reaction are the substituted pyrrolidines of general formulas 33. and 34 as shown. The products 33 and 34 are diastereoisomers of each other and may therefore be separated by standard methods such as recrystallization or by liquid chromatography on a solid support such as silica gel. As discussed above, if the trans isomer of the cinnamic acid of general formula 29 is employed in the first step of reaction Scheme G, then a trans isomer of the substituted cinnamyl oxazolidinone 31 is produced. If such a trans cinnamyl oxazolidinone is then subjected to the azomethine ylid cycloaddition with an azomethine ylid precursor of formula 25, the products are the diastereoisomeric trans- disubstituted pyrrolidines related to 33. and 34.<br><br><br><br>
The azomethine ylid cycloaddition reactions shown in reaction Schemes F and G are generally conducted with the commercially available azomethine ylid precursor A^-(methoxymethyl)-A^-(trimelhylsilylmethyl)-benzylamine (25, Rl = -CH2Ph). When the R1 subslituent in the title compounds of structural formula I is chosen to be a group other than benzyl, it is generally preferable to remove the benzyl group from the substituted pyrrolidine compound at this point, and replace it with a more readily removed protecting group such as an N-BOC group. Reaction Scheme H illustrates this process with a generalized 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidine of formula 32. The preferred method for removal of Ihe N-benzyl group from compounds of general formula 32 will depend upon the identity of the R3 substituents. If these substituents are unaffected by hydrogenation conditions, then the N-benzyl group may be removed by hydrogenolysis using a palladium on carbon catalyst in a solvent such as ethanol and in the presence of hydrogen gas or a hydrogen donor such as formic acid. Occasionally it may be preferred that one of the substituents R3 be a halogen or another substituent defined above which would be reactive under hydrogenation conditions. In these cases, the compound of general formula 32 is reacted with 1-chloroethyl chloroformate in an inert solvent such as toluene at temperatures between room temperature and 110Â°C (Olafson, R.A. et al../ Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 2081). The toluene is then removed, and the residue is heated in methanol for a period of 15-60 minutes, and the product is the debenzylated pyrrolidine of general formula 15. The resulting pyrrolidine 31 is then protected as its tert-butyl carbamate (36) using BOC anhydride in the presence of a base and a suitable solvent. For example, this<br><br>
can be accomplished in a two phase mixture of chloroform and aqueous sodium bicarbonate as shown in reaction Scheme H.<br>
The oxazolidinone chiral auxilliary is next hydrolyzed from the pyrrolidines of general formula 36 as shown at the bottom of reaction Scheme H. The hydrolysis reaction is accomplished using lithium hydroperoxide generated in situ from lithium hydroxide and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is typically conducted in a solvent system such as aqueous THF, and the reaction is performed at temperatures between 0Â°C and room temperature for a period of 1 -6 hours. The resulting carboxylic acids of general formula 37 correspond to carboxylic acids of general formula 2 where both r and s are 1. Using the methodology presented in reaction Scheme A, the compounds of general formula 37 may tlien be converted to the compounds of the present invention of structural formula I.<br><br>
As noted previously in the discussion of reaction Scheme D, it may occasionally be preferable to incorporate the Rl substituent into the substituted pyrrolidine of general formula 37 at an earlier stage of the synthesis, for instance when it is desired that Rl be a tert-huiyl group. In such cases, it is possible to utilize an azomethine ylid precursor (25) bearing the desired R1 substituent in the cycloaddition reactions illustrated in reaction Schemes F and G. Reaction Scheme I illustrates the preparation of azomethine precursors of formula 25 starting with amines of general<br><br>
formula J_8. Reaction of the amine of formula J_8 with chioromethyltrimethylsilane at high temperature and in the absence of solvent affords the N-trimethylsilylmelhyl-substituted amine of general formula 31. Subsequent reaction of 38 with aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of methanol and a base such as potassium carbonate then affords the generalized ylid precursor 25, which can be utilized in the cycloaddition reactions discussed above.<br><br>
Reaction Schemes J-L illustrate additional methods for the synthesis of the 4-substituted piperidines of general formula i which are required in the amide bond coupling step illustrated in reaction Scheme A. As shown in Reaction Scheme J, treatment of enoltriflate 39 (prepared as described in: Rohr, M.; Chayer, S.; Garrido, F.; Mann, A.; Taddei, M.; Wermuth, C-G. Heterocycles 1996, 43, 2131-2138.) with bis(pinacolato)diboron reagent in the presence of a suitable palladium (II) catalyst such as [l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium (II) (Pd(dppf)Cl2) and potassium acetate in a polar, inert organic solvent such as methyl sulfoxide at about 80Â°C under an inert atmosphere for a period of 6-24 hours provided the vinyl dioxaborolane 40. Borolane 40 can be further reacted with an aryl halide such as 4i in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (Pd(Ph3)4) and potassium phosphate in an inert solvent such as A',A^-dimethylformamide to give the coupled 4-aryl tetrahydropyridine product 42. The tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group can be removed by any of the known methods such as treatment with a protic acid such as hydrogen chloride in an inert organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride to give amine 43.    Alternatively, it is sometimes desirable to reduce the double bond in synthetic intermediate 42. This can be effected by treatment with hydrogen at atmospheric or elevated pressure and a noble metal catalyst on carbon such as palladium (0) or platinum(IV) oxide in an inert organic solvent such-as ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid or mixtures thereof to give the 4-arylpiperidine 44. Removal of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group as described above provides amine 45. Both amine intermediates, 41 and 45, may be used as coupling partners in Reaction Scheme A.<br><br><br>
As shown in Reaction Scheme K, aryl groups containing substituents with acidic hydrogens (e.g. 46 and 48) can be modified by alkylation under known protocols. For instance, treatment of esters 46 or 48 with a strong base such a lithium diisopropylamide at low temperature in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran can form an intermediate enolate which can be reacted in a second step with any alkylating agent (B-LG) such as iodomethane, iodoethane, 1,2-dibromoethane or the like to form the corresponding alkylated product. In addition to ester groups, related amides and functionalities that promote the formation of a stable anion can be alkylated under similar protocols.<br><br><br>
Ester intermediates such as 47 and 49 may be further modified by conversion to the corresponding carboxylic acids and coupled with amines to form amides as described in Reaction Scheme L. Conversion of the methyl esters 47 and 49 to the carboxylic acid can be effected by dealkylation using potassium trimethylsilanolate at room temperature in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran for a period of about one to about 24 hours to provide, after acidification, the corresponding carboxylic acids. In certain cases, a base-catalyzed hydrolysis known to those skilled in the ait may be used to effect this same transformation. These acids may be reacted further to form amides by treatment with a primary or secondary amine under a variety of amide coupling protocols such as described in Scheme A to provide intermediates 50 and 51-<br><br><br>
Reaction Scheme M illustrates general methods for the elaboration of an Rl substituent following assembly of a compound of structural formula I (wherein Rl = BOC) as described in reaction Scheme A. The N-BOC protected compound of structural formula I is first deprotected under acidic conditions for instance by treatment with hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate or using trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. The resulting heterocyclic compound of structural formula I (Rl = H) may then be subjected to one of several alkylation strategies known in organic chemistry. For instance, compounds (I) (RI = H) may be utilized in a reductive amination reaction with a suitable carbonyl containing partner (52). The reductive amination is achieved by initial formation of an imine between the amine of formula I (Rl = H) and either an aldehyde or ketone of formula 52. The intermediate imine is then treated with a reducing agent capable of reducing carbon-nitrogen double bonds such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride and an alkylated product of structural formula I is produced. Alternatively, a heterocyclic compound of structural formula (I) (Rl = H) may be directly alkylated using an alkylating agent such as 51 in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMF. In this reaction, the substituent Z of compound 53 is a good leaving group such as a halide,<br><br>
mesylate or tritlate and the product is the compound of structural formula I bearing the R' substituent.<br><br>
The following Examples are provided to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner. Intermediate Wl was prepared as described in Scheme N following the general procedure described in Scheme F.<br><br><br>
Step A:	Preparation N-tert-butyl-N-(trimethvlsilvlmethyantine (N-1)<br>
A mixture of/er/-butylamine (18.0 mL, 171 mniol) and (chloromethyl)trimethylsilane (7.00 g, 57.1 mmol) was heated jn a thick-walled glass tube at 200Â°C overnight. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into 1 N NaOH and extracted three times with diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgS04), and the volatiles evaporated in vacuo. Distillation (atmospheric pressure; -135Â°C) of the residual liquid gave the title compound as a colorless liquid (7.67 g).<br>

stirred solution of aqueous formaldehyde (5.98 mL of a 37 wt. % solution in water, 79.7 mmol) at 0C (ice cooling). After 45 min, methanol (6.45 mL, 159.3 mmol) was added and the resulting solution was saturated with potassium carbonate. After stirring vigorously for approximately 5 h, the aqueous phase was removed. The organic phase was saturated with potassium carbonate and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted three times with diethyl ether. The; combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgS04) and the volatiles evaporated in vacuo. Distillation (high vacuum; -70Â°C) of the residual liquid afforded the title compound as a colorless liquid (3.50 g).<br>

After 18 h, the reaction mixture was poured into saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and extracted three times with methlene chloride. The combined organic extracs were washed with brine, dried (Na2S04) and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the residue by normal phase medium pressure liquid chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution;0-9% methanol (containing 10% v/v ammonium hydroxide)/methylene chloride as eluent) gave the title compound as a colorless liquid (3.50 g, 78%). The racemic titled compound was resolved into its enantiomeric components using preparative chiral high pressure liquid chromatography on CHIRALPAK AD Phase (5 % isopropanol/heptanes as eluent) to give in order of elution: methyl (3S,4R)-]-/er/-butyl-4-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidine-3-carboxylate enantiomer (1.37 g) as a colorless oil followed by the methyl {3R,4S)-\-lert-butyl-4-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidine-3-carboxylate enantiomer (1.18 g) as a colorless oil.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS<br>
A. Binding Assay. The membrane binding assay was used to identify competitive inhibitors of 125I-NDP-alpha-MSH binding to cloned human MCRs expressed in mouse Ivor Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-cens.<br>
Cell lines expressing melanocortin receptors were grown in T-180 flasks containing selec(ive medium of the composition: 1 L Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g L-glucose, 25 mM Hepes, without sodium pyruvate, (Gibco/BRl); 100 ml 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma); 10 mL 10,000 unit/mL penicillin &amp; 10,000 |ig/mL streptomycin (Gibco/BRl); 10 ml 200 mM L-glutamine<br>
(Gibco/BRl); 1 mg/mL geneticin (G418) (Gibco/BRl). The cells were grown at 37Â°C with CO2 and humidity control until the desired cell density and cell number was obtained.<br>
The medium was poured off and 10 mls/monolayer of enzyme-free dissociation media (Specialty Media Inc.) was added. The cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min or until cells sloughed off when flask was banged against hand.<br>
The cells were harvested into 200 mL centrifuge tubes and spun at 1000 rpm, 4Â° C, for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 5 mls/monolayer membrane preparation buffer having the composition: 10 mM Tris pH 7.2-7.4; 4 Âµg/mL Leupeptin (Sigma); 10 \xM Phosphoramidon (Boehringer Mannheim); 40 Âµg/mL Bacitracin (Sigma); 5Âµ g/mL Aprotinin (Sigma); 10 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were homogenized with motor-driven dounce (Talboy Setting 40), using 10 strokes and the homogenate centrifuged at 6,000 rpm, 4Â°C, for 15 min.<br>
The pellets were resuspended in 0.2 mls/monolayer membrane prep buffer and aliquots were placed in tubes (500-1000 ÂµL/tube) and quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80Â°C.<br>
Test compounds or unlabelled NDP-a-MSH was added to 100 (,iL of membrane binding buffer to a final concentration of 1ÂµM. The membrane binding buffer had the composition: 50 mM Tris pH 7.2; 2 mM CaCb; 1 mM MgCL; 5 mM KCl; 0.2% BSA; 4 Âµg/mL Leupeptin (SIGMA); 10ÂµM Phosphoramidon (Boehringer Mannheim); 40 l-tg/mL Bacitracin (SIGMA); 5Âµg/mL Aprotinin (SIGMA); and 10 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), One hundred ÂµL of membrane binding buffer containing 10-40 Âµg membrane protein was added, followed by 100ÂµM 125I-NDP-a-MSH to final concentration of 100 pM. The resulting mixture was vortexed briefly and incubated for 90-120 min at room temp while shaking.<br><br>
The mixture was filtered with Packard Microplate 196 filter apparatus using Packard IJnifilter 96-well G17C filter with 0.1% polyethyieneimine (Sigma). The filter was washed (5 times with a total of 10 mL per well) with room temperature of filter wash having the composition: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 and 20 mM NaCl. The filter was dried, and the bottom sealed and 50 p,L of Packard Microscint-20 was added to each well. The top was sealed and the radioactivity quantitated in a Packard Topcount Microplate Scinfillation counter.<br>
D. Funcfional assay. Functional cell based assays were developed to discriminate melanocortin receptor agonists from antagonists.<br>
Cells (for example, CHO- or L-cells or other eukaryotic cells) expressing a human melanocortin receptor (see e.g. Yang-YK; Ollmann-MM; Wilson-BD; Dickinson-C; Yamada-T; Barsh-GS; Gantz-I; Mol-Endocrinol. 1997 Mar; 11(3): 274-80) were dissociated from tissue culture flasks by rinsing with Ca and Mg free phosphate buffered saline (14190-136, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and detached following 5 min incubation at 37Â°C with enzyme free dissociation buffer (S-014-B, Specialty Media, Lavellette, NJ). Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (14015-069, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) with additions of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 rnM glutamine and 1 mg/.ml bovine serum<br>
albumin. Cells were counted and diluted to 1 to 5 x 10 /mL. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyI-l-methylxanthine was added to cells to 0.6 mM.<br>
Test compounds were diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (10" to 10 M) and 0.1 volume of compound solution was added to 0.9 volumes of cell suspension; the final DMSO concentration was 1%. After room temperature incubation for 45 min, cells were lysed by incubation at 100Â°C for 5 min to release accumulated cAMP.<br>
cAMP was measured in an aliquot of the cell lysate with the Amersham<br>
(Arlington Heights, IL) cAMP detection assay (RPA556). The amount of cAMP<br>
production which resulted from an unknown compound was compared to that amount of<br>
cAMP produced in response to alpha-MSH which was defined as a 100 % agonist. The EC50 is defined as the compound concentration which results in half maximal stimulation,<br>
when compared to its own maximal level of stimulation.<br>
Antagonist assay: Antagonist activity was defined as the ability of a compound to block cAMP production in response to alpha-MSH. Solution of test compounds and suspension of receptor containing cells were prepared and mixed as described above; the mixture was incubated for 15 min, and an EC50 dose (approximately<br><br>
10 nM alpha-MSH) was added to the cells. The assay was terminated at 45 min and cAMP quantitated as above. Percent inhibition was determined by comparing the amount ofcAMP produced in the presence to that produced in the absence of test compound.<br>
C. In vivo food intake models.<br>
1)	Overnight food intake. Sprague Dawiey rats are injected intracerebroventricularly with a test compound in 400 nL of 50% propylene glycol/artificial cerebrospinal fluid one hour prior to onset of dark cycle (12 hours). Food intake is determined using a computerized system in which each rat's food is placed on a computer monitored balance. Cumulative food intake for 16 h post compound administration is measured.<br>
2)	Food intake in diet induced obese mice. Male C57/B16J mice maintained on a high fat diet (60% fat calories) for 6.5 months from 4 weeks of age are are dosed intraperitoneally with test compound. Food intake and body weight are measured over an eight day period. Biochemical parameters relating to obesity, including ieptin, insulin, triglyceride, free fatty acid, cholesterol and serum glucose levels are determined.<br>
D. Rat Ex Copula Assay<br>
Sexually mature male Caesarian Derived Sprague Dawiey (CD) rats (over 60 days old) are used with the suspensory ligament surgically removed to prevent retraction of the penis back into the penile sheath during the ex copula evaluations. Animals receive food and water ad lib and are kept on a normal light/dark cycle. Studies are conducted during the light cycle.<br>
1) Conditioning to Supine Restraint for Ex Copula Reflex Tests. This conditioning takes - 4 days. Day 1, the animals are placed in a darkened restrainer and left for 15-30 minutes. Day 2, the animals are restrained in a supine position in the restrainer for 15-30 minutes. Day 3, the animals are restrained in the supine position vhich the penile sheath retracted for 15 - 30 minutes. Day 4, the animals are restrained in the supine position with the penile sheath retracted until penile responses are observed. Some animals require additional days of conditioning before they are completely acclimated to the procedures; non-respondcrs are removed from further evaluation. After any handling or evaluation animals arc given a treat to ensure positive reinforcement.<br>
2) Ex Copula Reflex Tests. Rats are gently restrained in a supine position with their anterior torso placed inside a cylinder of adequate size to allow for normal head<br><br>
and paw grooming. For a 400-500 gram rat, the diameter of the cylinder is approximately 8 cm. The lower torso and hind limbs are restrained with a non-adhesive material (vetrap). An additional piece of vetrap with a hole in it, through which the glans penis will be passed, is festened over the animal to maintain the preputial sheath in a retracted position, Penile responses will be observed, typically termed ex copula genital reflex tests. Typically, a series of penile erections will occur spontaneously within a few minutes after sheath retraction. The types of normal reflexogenic erectile responses include elongation, engorgement, cup and flip. An elongation is classified as an extension of the penile body. Engorgement is a dilation of the glans penis. A cup is defined as an intense erection where the distal margin of the glans penis momentarily flares open to form a cup. A flip is a dorsi flexion of the penile body.<br>
Baseline and or vehicle evaluations are conducted to determine how and if an animal will respond. Some animals have a long duration until the first response while others are non-responders altogether. During this baseline evaluation latency to first response, number and type of responses are recorded. The testing time frame is 15 minutes after the first response.<br>
After a minimum of 1 day between evaluations, these same animals are administered the test compound at 20 mg/kg and evaluated for penile reflexes. All evaluations arc videotaped and scored later. Data are collected and analyzed using paired 2 tailed t-lests to compared baseline and/ or vehicle evaluations to drug treated evaluations for individual animals. Groups of a minimum of 4 animals are utilized to reduce variability.<br>
Positive reference controls are included in each study to assure the validity of the study. Animals can be dosed by a number of routes of administration depending on the nature of the study to be performed. The routes of administration includes intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC) and intracerebral ventricular (ICV).<br>
1:. Models of Female Sexual Dysfunction<br>
Rodent assays relevant to female sexual receptivity include the behavioral model of lordosis and direct observations of copulatory activity. There is also a urethrogenital reflex model in anesthetized spinally transected rats for measuring orgasm in both male and female rats. These and other established animal models of female sexual dysfunction are described in McKenna KE et al, A Model For The Study of Sexual Inmction In Anesthetized Male And Female Rats. Am. J. Physiol. (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol 30): R1276-R1285, 1991; McKenna KE et al, Modulation By Peripheral<br><br>
