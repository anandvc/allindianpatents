nerve protective action, nerve regeneration promotion<br>
action and neurite outgrowth action, and is a useful<br>
compound as remedies for central nervous system and<br>
peripheral nerve diseases.<br>
As processes for production of this compound,<br>
for example, (1) a process of reacting 5-(2-(3-<br>
chloropropoxy)ethyl)-1-benzothiophene with 3-azetidinol<br>
or salts thereof, (2) a process of subjecting 1-(3-(2-<br>
(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy) propionyl)azetidin-3-ol<br>

yl)ethoxy)propionic acid or its salts thereof to<br>
reduction reaction with borane-tetrahydrofuran complex<br>
or subjecting it to reduction reaction with sodium<br>
borohydride in the presence of boron trifluoride<br>
complex tetrahydrofuran complex, and so forth are known<br>
(patent document 1).<br>
However, the process of (1) has the following<br>
defects, (A) the yield is low, (B) complicated<br>
procedures of purification such as silica gel column<br>
chromatography are necessary, (C) therefore, a lot of<br>
waste is egested, and so forth.<br>
In addition, the process of (2) cannot be<br>
satisfied as an industrial manufacturing process,<br>
because the process has the following defects, (A) the<br>
process uses reagents of borane-tetrahydrofuran complex<br>
and boron trifluoride tetrahydrofuran and so forth,<br>
which are harmful to human body, highly flammable,<br>
highly toxic and having problems of stability, (B)<br>
therefore, attention is necessary to handle and store<br>
it and special equipments are required, and so forth.<br>
[0003]<br>
In addition, as a process for production of<br>

to Michael addition reaction with acrylonitrile,<br>
subsequently subjecting it to hydrolysis with acid, and<br>

However, the processes of (3) and (4) cannot<br>
be satisfied as industrial manufacturing processes,<br>
because these processes have the following defects, the<br>
process of (3): (A) by-products form because of the<br>
occurrence of trans-esterification of acrylic acid, (B)<br>
special equipments and treatments are required because<br>
of the occurrence of a large quantity of combustible<br>
isobutene gas in de-tert-butylation reaction, the<br>
process of (4): the yield of hydrolysis with acid is<br>
low, and so forth.<br>
[0004]<br>

hydrolysis to obtain (1-benzothiophen-5-<br>
yl)acetaldehyde, subsequently subjecting it to<br>
reduction reaction, and so forth (patent document 3).<br>
However, the processes of (5) to (7) cannot<br>
be satisfied as industrial manufacturing processes,<br>
because these processes have the following defects, (A)<br>
intermediates have a stimulatory property, (B) a highly<br>
toxic reagent(cyano compounds) is used, (C) a<br>
carcinogenic reagent(ethylene oxide) is used, (D)<br>
highly ignitable reagents(butyllithium, Grignard<br>
reagent) are used, (E) procedures of the reaction are<br>
complicated, and so forth.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, as processes for<br>
production of benzothiopheneacetic acid derivative or<br>
salts thereof, for example, the following processes are<br>
known, (8) a process of subjecting the hydroxyl group<br>
of benzothiophenemethanol to halogenation, subsequently<br>
subjecting it to reaction with cyano compounds to<br>
obtain benzothiopheneacetonitrile, subsequently<br>
subjecting it to hydrolysis (non-patent document 3),<br>
(9) a process of subjecting 7-oxo-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrobenzothiophene produced from 3-bromothiophene<br>
to Reformatsky reaction with ethyl bromoacetate,<br>
subsequently subjecting it to aromatization by<br>
dehydrogenation by use of sulfur, and subjecting it to<br><br>
hydrolysis, and so forth (non-patent document 4).<br>
However, the processes of (8) and (9) cannot<br>
be satisfied as industrial manufacturing processes,<br>
because these processes have the following defects, (A)<br>
intermediates have a stimulatory property, (B) a highly<br>
toxic reagent(cyano compounds) is used, (C) therefore,<br>
complicated treatments of waste are required, (D) there<br>
are many steps of the process (E) the yield is low, (F)<br>
the reaction temperature is high, (G) procedures of the<br>
reaction are complicated, and so forth.<br>
[0006]<br>

base to obtain 2-(4-halogenophenylthio)acetaldehyde<br>
dimethylacetal, subsequently subjecting it to<br>
intramolecular ring closure reaction in the presence of<br>
polyphosphoric acid, and so forth (non-patent document<br>
5, patent document 4, patent document 5).<br>
However, the process of (10) cannot be<br>
satisfied as an industrial manufacturing process,<br>
because the process has the following defects, (A)<br>
complicated procedures such as distillation or silica<br>
gel column chromatography and so forth are necessary to<br>
isolated because the production intermediates are oily<br>
substances, (B) treatments of the process are<br><br>
complicated in ring closure reaction by use of<br>
phosphate compound because complicated by-products<br>
form, (C) complicated procedures such as distillation<br>
or silica gel column chromatography and so forth are<br>
necessary to separate 5-halogeno-1-benzothiophene<br>
derivatives from formed by-products because their<br>
derivatives have low melting points, (D) a large<br>
quantities of liquid waste is formed, which contains<br>
phosphorus compounds that require complicated<br>
procedures for treatment, and so forth.<br>
[0007]<br>
