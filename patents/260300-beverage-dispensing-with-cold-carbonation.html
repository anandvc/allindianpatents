				<td>BEVERAGE DISPENSING WITH COLD CARBONATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to beverage dispensing, and in particular to<br>
methods and apparatus for beverage dispensing with cold carbonation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In "post-mix" beverage dispensing, beverage syrups are mixed with plain or<br>
carbonated water to form finished beverages. With respect to carbonated beverages,<br>
issues surrounding carbonation significantly affect the quality of the finished beverage.<br>
For high quality beverages, for example, it is important that the specified<br>
carbonation level be consistently produced, regardless of system variations, such as<br>
ambient temperature. As another example, it is important that, in the dispensing of the<br>
finished product, foaming be minimized.<br>
Efficient and cost-effective production of such high quality beverages is, of course,<br>
desirable. It has been discovered that lowering the temperature of water to be carbonated<br>
increases carbonation efficiency, and can allow for lower CO2 pressures. Accordingly,<br>
prior art efforts have been made to increase carbonation efficiency by using colder water.<br>
For example, US Patent number 4,754,609 discloses pre-cooling water before carbonation.<br>
As further examples, US Patent numbers 5,319,947, 5,419,461, and 5,524,452 disclose<br>
chilled carbonators. However, significant improvements can be made to the efficiency,<br>
cost, and space utilization (among other aspects) of the prior art.<br>
Therefore, a need has arisen for an improved beverage dispenser and methods that<br>
make use of cold carbonation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, methods and apparatus<br>
for beverage dispensing with cold carbonation are provided that substantially eliminate or<br>
reduce problems associated with prior art systems.<br>
A dispenser is provided that includes a cold source (such as a cold plate or an<br>
ice/water bath) and a carbonator that comprises one or more conjoined segments located<br>
substantially within the cold source. The conjoined segments may form a continuous or<br>
discontinuous hollow structure.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a carbonator is provided that includes a toroidal tank, a<br>
water inlet, a carbon dioxide inlet, and a sensor for measuring water level within the tank.<br>
The tank may form a continuous or discontinuous structure.<br><br>
Furthermore, a dispenser is provided that has a first side, and includes a cold plate,<br>
a carbonator at least partially within the cold plate, and a sensor coupled to the carbonator,<br>
the sensor being accessible from the first side of the dispenser. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the first side is the front side of the dispenser at which beverages are<br>
dispensed.<br>
Also provided is a dispenser having a horizontal plane, the dispenser including a<br>
cold plate, and a carbonator at least partially within the cold plate, the carbonator being<br>
tilted with respect to the horizontal plane.<br>
Also provided is a carbonator that includes a first tank section, a second tank<br>
section, and a third tank section. The first and third sections are coupled with the second<br>
section, the third section extending outward from said second section. .<br>
In particular embodiments, a dispenser includes a substantially flat carbonator tank<br>
and a substantially horizontal cold plate, with the carbonator tank located substantially<br>
within the cold plate. Also, the dispenser may include a plurality of water inlets into the<br>
carbonator tank. Also, the dispenser may include a probe assembly substantially parallel<br>
to the carbonator tank.<br>
Methods of carbonating water are also provided, including a method of<br>
carbonating water that comprises providing a carbonator tank within a cold plate, injecting<br>
carbon dioxide into the tank, chilling water, injecting the chilled water into the tank, and<br>
chilling soda received from the tank.<br>
With each of the embodiments, a pre-carbonation chilling circuit may be coupled<br>
to the carbonator. Similarly, a post-carbonation chilling circuit may be coupled to the<br>
carbonator.<br>
An important technical advantage of the present invention is that it greatly<br>
improves carbonation efficiency by including a carbonator integrally formed with a cold<br>
plate.<br>
Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the use of<br>
carbonation tank segments or toroid shapes to achieve geometries that provide efficient<br>
carbonation in small shapes.<br>
Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the use of<br>
integral pre-carbonation cooling circuits and/or post carbonation cooling circuits.<br>
Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the use of<br>
multiple water inlets to a cold carbonator. Still another important technical advantage of<br><br>
FIGURE 3 also illustrates pre-chill circuit 42. Pre-chill circuit 42 allows plain<br>
water to be chilled before entering carbonator tank 13. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
pre-chilled water is injected through a plurality of orifice blocks into the carbonator tank<br>
13. However, only one injection point may also be used. Soda is conveyed from the<br>
carbonator tank 13 through one or more ports to a post-carbonation chilling circuit 44.<br>
This post-carbonation chilling circuit 44, like the pre-chill circuit 42, is preferably<br>
integrally formed within the cold plate 12. The post-chilled soda is then conveyed to a<br>
manifold 46 for transmission to the valves 18.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pre-chill circuit 42 chills the plain water to<br>
approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The post-chill circuit 44 chills the soda to a<br>
temperature in the range of preferably 34-40 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to chilling<br>
the soda, the post-chill circuit 44 stabilizes the flow from the carbonator 13 into a less<br>
turbulent flow. Thus, more CO2 remains in stream because of this more laminar flow,<br>
resulting in less foaming at dispense and higher carbonation (and therefore higher quality<br>
in the finished beverage product). However, it should be understood that either or both of<br>
the chilling circuits 42 and 44 may or may not be included as part of the present invention.<br>
FIGURE 4 illustrates details of the carbonator tank 13 for the particular<br>
embodiment discussed in connection with FIGURE 3. As shown in FIGURE 4, CO2 is<br>
supplied to the carbonator through fitting 50. Connected to fitting 50 is safety relief valve<br>
28. The CO2 is injected into the carbonator tank 13 at connection 52. Although only one<br>
connection 52 is shown, a plurality of injection points may be used. Soda is conveyed<br>
from the carbonator tank 13 through outlet fittings 54, which transmit the soda to the post<br>
cooling circuit 44 shown in FIGURE 3.<br>
FIGURE 5 illustrates the embodiment shown in FIGURES 3 and 4, with examples<br>
of pre-and post- chill circuits 42 and 44. As shown in FIGURE 5, in a particular<br>
embodiment, two post-chill circuits 44 begin at the outlet connection points 54 and convey<br>
soda to the soda manifold 46. In the particular embodiment shown, two separate circuits<br>
44 are shown, one beginning from each connection point 54. However, it should be<br>
understood that only one, or more than two, circuits may be used without departing from<br>
the intended scope of the present invention. Also shown in FIGURE 5 are two pre-<br>
carbonation chilling circuits 42. These pre-carbonation chilling circuits 42 begin at a T-<br>
connection 56 that splits a single stream of plain water into two streams for the two<br>
separate chilling circuits 42. It should be understood, however, that only one, or more<br><br>
the present invention is its easy access to sensors for measuring water level in the<br>
carbonator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a beverage dispenser 10 according to the teachings of the<br>
present invention. The particular dispenser 10 shown in FIGURE 1 is adapted to be<br>
placed on the top of a counter and dispenses both beverages and ice. However, it should<br>
be understood that the present invention is not limited to this particular embodiment, and<br>
applies to all dispensers, including those that have areas underneath the counter, and<br>
whether or not they also dispense ice.<br><br>
Included within dispenser 10 is a cold plate 12, a carbonator tank 13 within the<br>
cold plate 12, and carbonator probe assembly 14. The carbonator probe assembly 14 is<br>
used for measuring water levels within the carbonator 13, and is easily accessible through<br>
the front of dispenser 10. The cold plate 12 and probe assembly 14 may also be<br>
configured for access through the rear or sides of dispenser 10. Configuration of the probe<br>
assembly 14 for horizontal access is a significant improvement of the present invention<br>
over prior art systems, as it facilitates easy access for maintenance and repair.<br>
Importantly, the carbonator tank 13 of one embodiment of the present invention is<br>
located within the cold plate 12, and is generally substantially horizontal in its orientation.<br>
This provides significant advantages. In particular, the carbonator probe assembly can be<br>
easily accessed, as discussed above. Also, the carbonation occurs at a low temperature,<br>
thus increasing carbonation efficiency and allowing for lower (and thus easier to work<br>
with) CO2 pressures. With carbonation occurring in the cold plate, instead of without<br>
cooling, the carbonation level is substantially constant as ambient temperatures change,<br>
thus eliminating the need to change carbonation pressures in different seasons. Also,<br>
because carbonation occurs in the dispenser, installation and manufacturing are made<br>
easier as there is no separate carbonator. Similarly, asset tracking is made easier, and asset<br>
loss is reduced, as there is no separate carbonator to keep up with.<br>
Furthermore, the relatively horizontally-oriented carbonator of one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, located substantially within the cold plate, provides significant<br>
advantages in that space is used very efficiently, in contrast to certain prior art attempts,<br>
where carbonators are located adjacent to or extend substantially from a relatively<br>
horizontal cold plate.<br>
To achieve appropriate carbonation capacity, and to accommodate the other<br>
elements of the cold plate (cooling circuits for syrups and plain water), the geometry of the<br>
carbonator of the present invention is designed as one or more continuous or discontinuous<br>
tank segments. These segments allow room for the other cooling circuits. And, because<br>
of the relatively high surface area to volume ratio (thus efficient heat transfer) that results<br>
from using segments, very efficient carbonation is achieved.<br>
Dispenser 10 also includes nozzles 16 through which finished products are<br>
dispensed. These nozzles mix either non-carbonated water (plain water) or carbonated<br>
water (soda) with beverage syrups and/or syrup flavors from valves 18 to produce finished<br>
beverages. The particular embodimentillustrates multiflavor nozzles 16 each coupled to a<br><br>
plurality of valves 18; however, single flavor setups are within the present scope. Ice<br>
chute 20 is also provided for dispensing ice. Drip tray 22 is positioned below the nozzles.<br>
In operation, finished products are dispensed into cups placed between the nozzles 16 and<br>
the drip tray 22.<br>
The present invention also includes an integral pump 24 for pumping water to the<br>
carbonator tank 13. Also illustrated is motor 26, used to drive a mechanism for moving<br>
ice from the interior of the dispenser 10 to the ice chute 20, as will be discussed below in<br>
connection with FIGURE 2.<br>
It should be understood that, in a final dispenser, one or more cover plates are<br>
included to cover, from the user's view, items such as the valves 18, the pump 24, and the<br>
motor 26. However, such cover plates are easily removed (such as with a few screws), to<br>
facilitate easy maintenance. As shown, most of the elements of the dispenser 10 are<br>
located at the front of the dispenser, thus allowing for easy access and improved<br>
maintenance.<br>
Removal of the drip tray 22 reveals the front of the cold plate 12, allowing easy<br>
access to the carbonator probe assembly 14. Also illustrated is CO2 relief valve 28 and<br>
cold plate inlets 30 and outlets 32. Inlets 30 receive water and syrup to be chilled through<br>
the cold plate 12, and also water to be carbonated in the carbonator tank 13. The outlets<br>
32 transmit chilled syrups and water (both plain and carbonated water) to the valves 18.<br>
The cold plate 12 is cooled with ice that can be manually dropped into ice bin 33 of the<br>
dispenser 10, or, alternatively, an icemaker can be placed atop or adjacent to the dispenser<br>
10 to produce ice and convey it into the ice bin 33. As another alternative, a remote<br>
icemaker can be used to generate ice which can then be conveyed automatically, such as<br>
through a pneumatic tube, to the ice bin 33.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a side cut away view of the dispenser 10 shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2, the cold plate 12 includes integral carbonator 13. The carbonator<br>
probes of carbonator assembly 14 extend through the cold plate 12 and into the carbonator<br>
13.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2, the dispenser 10 includes insulation 31 surrounding the<br>
central ice bin 33 of the dispenser. The motor 26 drives a paddle wheel 35 used to convey<br>
ice from the ice bin to the ice dispenser chute 20. The paddle wheel conceptually shown<br>
in FIGURE 2 is illustrative only, and other mechanisms may also be used. As discussed<br><br>
above, it should be understood that the cold plate of the present invention does not have to<br>
be used in connection with a dispenser that also dispenses ice.<br>
In operation, ice cools the cold plate 12, which is formed from a conductive<br>
material, such as aluminum. Water and syrup are thus cooled as they flow through their<br>
respective water and syrup circuits within the cold plate 12. Importantly, the carbonator<br>
13, and the water within the carbonator 13, are cooled in this same way, thus allowing for<br>
higher carbonation efficiency. With this higher carbonation efficiency, lower CO2<br>
pressures can be used, resulting in a more reliable, less expensive dispenser.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2, cold plate 12 is tilted with respect to a horizontal plane of<br>
the dispenser 10. This tilting allows for the sensor of probe assembly 14 to more easily<br>
read changes in the water level, because, for some geometries, the more nearly horizontal<br>
the carbonator tank 30 and cold plate 12 are, the smaller the change in the water level is<br>
when soda is discharged from the carbonator tank 30. However, no such tilting is<br>
necessary. When, in this description, the carbonator 13 of the present invention is referred<br>
to as substantially, or relatively, horizontal, it includes orientations with some tilting.<br>
Also, the tilting can be accomplished by tilting the cold plate in winch the carbonator tank<br>
is cast, or by tilting the carbonator within an otherwise horizontal cold plate. Although<br>
any tilting angle can be used, preferably a tilting angle of less than about 20 degrees with<br>
respective horizontal plane is used.<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates a top view schematic of a cold plate 12 with integral<br>
carbonator 13 according to the teachings of the present invention. As shown in FIGURE<br>
3, carbonator tank 13 includes four conjoined segments 34, 36, 38, and 40. The cross<br>
section of any of these segments is preferably a circle, however any shape may be used.<br>
Similarly, the quadrilateral shape of carbonator tank 13 is exemplary only. Any shape can<br>
used that will provide the carbonation capacity required for the particular application. The<br>
particular geometric shape of the carbonator tank can be changed as desired to create the<br>
desired ratio of water to CO2 headspace in the carbonator, and to accommodate the amount<br>
of space needed in the cold plate for plain water and syrup cooling circuits.<br>
Although the particular carbonator 13 shown in FIGURE 3 includes segments that<br>
are continuously connected, such continuous shapes are not required, and as will be<br>
discussed below in connection with other embodiments, one or more continuous or<br>
discontinuous segments can be used.<br><br>
than two, circuits may be used without departing from the intended scope of the present<br>
invention. As discussed earlier, the pre-carbonation chilling circuits 42 cool the plain<br>
water before injection into the carbonator tank 13. The pre-chilled plain water is injected<br>
into the carbonator tank 13 at orifice blocks 58. In a particular embodiment shown, two<br>
orifice blocks 58 are used for generating two streams of water into the carbonator tank 13.<br>
The use of two streams improves efficiency over the use of a single stream by causing<br>
more turbulence within the carbonator tank. However, it should be understood that only<br>
one stream, or more than two streams, may be used without the departing from the<br>
intended scope of the present invention.<br>
FIGURE 6 and 7 show a side view of the carbonator tank 13 being discussed in<br>
connection with FIGURES 3-5. As shown in FIGURES 6 and 7, the plain water streams<br>
enter through orifice blocks 58 parallel to the segment 38 of the carbonator tank 13.<br>
However, it should be understood that other entry angles may be used without departing<br>
from the intended scope of the present invention. As is seen in FIGURE 6 and 7, the<br>
carbonator probe assembly 14 is an assembly that comprises two particular probes 60 and<br>
62. These probes measure the water level within the carbonator 13 and are used to control<br>
the pump 24 that pumps plain water into the pre-chill circuits 42 and into the carbonator<br>
tank 13. In particular, when both probes 60 and 62 are under water (as designated by the<br>
high water level mark in FIGURES 6 and 7) the signals from the probes will be used to<br>
turn the pump 24 off. Similarly, if probes 60 and 62 are both uncovered, as shown by the<br>
low water level, then the pump 24 will be turned on to inject more plain water into the<br>
carbonator tank 13. Although probe assembly 14, with probes 60 and 62, is illustrated,<br>
any kind of sensor for measuring water levels may be used, including, without limitation,<br>
those that reside outside of the carbonator tank and measure the levels indirectly (such as,<br>
without limitation, ultrasound-based sensors).<br>
The following descriptions of FIGURES 8, 9, and 10 illustrate that the present<br>
invention is not limited to any particular geometric shape or layout. In particular,<br>
continuous geometric shapes, such as toroids, or those formed with conjoined segments,<br>
may be used. Similarly, individual or conjoined segments that are not continuous may<br>
also be used. Also, embodiments with vertically displaced segments or sections can also<br>
be used.<br>
The particular carbonator embodiments discussed to this point are substantially flat<br>
embodiments. However, the present invention may also be used with carbonator<br><br>
geometries that have segments that are vertically (with respect to the dispenser) displaced.<br>
Thus, as seen in FIGURE 8, a particular carbonator 70 is illustrated that includes segments<br>
72, 74, and 76. Segments 72 and segments 76 are joined through vertical segment 74.<br>
The water level can be measured in segment 74 (as well as in segments 72 and 76) with<br>
carbonator probes that are either parallel, perpendicular, or at some other angle to the<br>
segment 74. Plain water is preferably injected into segment 72 or 74 of the carbonator 70,<br>
but can also be injected into segment 76. Soda is receive out of the segment 76 and then<br>
sent to one or more post-chill circuits as discussed in connection with previous FIGURES.<br>
Similarly, water injected into the carbonator 70 can be sent through one or more pre-chill<br>
circuits as discussed in connection with the previous embodiments. Also, the carbonator<br>
shown in FIGURE 8 is preferably cast into a cold plate.<br>
FIGURE 9 illustrates a carbonator 80 that is in the shape of a toroid, cast into a<br>
cold plate 82. As discussed above in connection with the other embodiments, plain water<br>
is injected into the carbonator tank 80 through one or more inlet ports after being chilled<br>
through a pre-chill circuit 84. Similarly, soda is taken out of the carbonator tank 80<br>
through a post-carbonation chill circuit 86. Although a toroid shape is shown in FIGURE<br>
9, other shapes can also be used, such as, without limitation, a single segment with an<br>
irregular shape (for example, like a snake), a single segment with a varying radius (for<br>
example a spiral or ovoid), and need not form a continuous hollow structure (for example,<br>
a "C" shape or spiral). For convenience, all such single segment shapes are referred to<br>
herein as toroids.<br>
FIGURE 10 illustrates a discontinuous carbonator tank 90 according to the<br>
teachings of the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 10, carbonator tank 90<br>
comprises a plurality of segments, some of which are joined but do not continuously join<br>
others. For example, segments 92 and 94 do not join together at their ends, but are stubs.<br>
Plain water is injected into carbonator tank 90 through inlet ports after being chilled<br>
through a pre-chill circuit 96. Also, soda is taken out of the carbonator tank 90 through a<br>
post-chill circuit 98. The carbonator tank 90, and pre-chill circuit 96 and post-chill circuit<br>
98 are preferably integrally formed within cold plate 100.<br>
FIGURE 11 illustrates the dispenser 110 according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Generally speaking, the teachings above apply to dispenser 110, except<br>
that rather than cooling with ice and a cold plate, dispenser 110 is cooled with a<br>
mechanical cooling unit, such as a vapor compression refrigeration unit 112.<br><br>
Refrigeration unit 112 generates an ice/water bath to cool the carbonator tank assembly<br>
120. In the particular embodiment shown, the carbonator tank assembly 120 is similar to<br>
that shown above in connection with FIGURE 5, and includes carbonator tank 130. Also<br>
shown in FIGURE 11 are circuits 132, 134, and 136. These circuits are used for cooling<br>
syrup, or plain water for non-carbonated beverages. These circuits reside in the chilled<br>
water bath created by refrigeration unit 112. Although not illustrated in connection with<br>
previous embodiments, such syrup and plain water circuits are also used and cast in the<br>
cold plates discussed above in connection with the cold plate embodiments.<br>
Although not shown, an electronic control system is also provided for controlling<br>
operation of the various embodiments dispensers discussed herein. The control system<br>
includes a microprocessor or micro-controller, and various input/output ports to effect the<br>
