ANTMGFR1 ANTIBODY THERAPEUTIC COMBINATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 50/524,732; filed November 21, 2003 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to therapeutic combinations comprising one or more anti-IGFR1 antibodies and one or more chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The insulin-like growth factors, also known as somatomedins, include insulin-like growth factor-! (IGF-l) and insulin-like growth factor-ll (IGF-II) (Klapper, et a/., (1983) Endocrinol. 112:2215 and Rinderknecht, et a/., (1978) Febs.Lett 89:283). These growth factors exert mitogenic activity on various cell types, including tumor cells (Macaulay, (1992) Br. J. Cancer 65:311), by binding to a common receptor named the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGFR1) (Sepp-Lorenzino, (1998) Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 47:235). Interaction of IGFs with IGFR1 activates the receptor by triggering autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues (Butler, et a/., (1998) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 121:19). Once activated, IGFR1, in turn, phosphorylates intracellular targets to activate cellular signaling pathways. This receptor activation is critical for stimulation of tumor cell growth and survival. Therefore, inhibition of IGFR1 activity represents a valuable potential method to treat or prevent growth of human cancers and other proliferative diseases.<br>
Several lines of evidence indicate that IGF-l, IGF-II and their receptor IGFR1 are important mediators of the malignant phenotype. Plasma levels of IGF-l have been found to be the strongest predictor of prostate cancer risk (Chan, et al., (1998) Science 279:563) and similar epidemiological studies strongly link plasma IGF-l levels with breast, colon and lung cancer risk.<br>
Overexpression of Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor-l has also been demonstrated in several cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. IGFR1 is overexpressed in 40% of all breast cancer cell lines (Pandini, et a/., (1999) Cancer Res. 5:1935) and in 15% of lung cancer cell lines. In breast cancer tumor tissue, IGFR1 is overexpressed 6-14 fold and 1GFR1 exhibits 2-4 fold higher kinase activity as compared to normal tissue (Webster, et al., (1996) Cancer Res. 56:2781 and Pekonen, et al, (1998) Cancer Res. 48:1343).<br><br>
Moreover, colorectal cancer tissue has been reported to exhibit strongly elevated IGFR1 levels (Weber et a/., Cancer 95(10):2086-95 (2002)). Analysis of primary cervical cancer cell cultures and cervical cancer cell lines revealed 3- and 5-fold overexpression of IGFR1, respectively, as compared to normal ectocervical cells (Steller, et a/., (1996) Cancer Res. 56:1762). Expression of IGFR1 in synovial sarcoma cells also correlated with an aggressive phenotype {i.e., metastasis and high rate of proliferation; Xie, et at., (1999) Cancer Res. 59:3588).<br>
Acromegaly, a slowly developing disease, is caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone and IGF-l (Ben-Schlomo, etai, (2001) Endocrin. Metab.Ciin. North. Am. 30:565-583). Antagonism of IGFR1 function is helpful in treating the disease.<br>
There are several antibodies, which are known in the art, which inhibit the activity of IGFR1. However, these are of relatively low therapeutic value: For example, a-IR3 (Kull, et a/., (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258:6561), 1H7 (U et a/., (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 196.92-98 and Xiong et a/., (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 89:5356-5360; Santa Cruz biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA) and MAB391 (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) are mouse monoclonal antibodies which interact with IGFR1 and inhibit its activity. Since these are mouse antibodies, their therapeutic utility in humans is limited. When an immunocompetent human subject is administered a dose of a murine antibody, the subject produces antibodies against the mouse immunoglobulin sequences. These human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) neutralize the therapeutic antibodies and may induce acute toxicity (i.e., a HAMA response).<br>
One method by which to avert a HAMA response is through the use of fully human antibodies which lack any foreign (e.g., mouse) amino acid sequences. Although the use of fully-human antibodies is an effective method by which to reduce or prevent human host immune rejection of the therapeutic antibody, rejection of the fully-human antibody can occur. Human rejection of human antibodies may be referred to as a human anti-human antibody response (HAHA response). HAHA response can be mediated by factors such as the presence of rare, low occurrence amino acid sequences in the fully-human antibodies. For this reason, therapeutic antibodies can also be optimized by the inclusion of non-immunogenic or only weakly immunogenic human antibody framework sequences. Preferably, the sequences occur frequently in other human antibodies.<br>
Although anti-IGFR1 antibodies are an effective means by which to treat medical conditions mediated by the receptor (e.g., cancer or acromegaly), the efficacy of such treatments would be enhanced by use of one or more additional chemotherapeutic<br><br>
agents. For example, an anti-)GFR1 antibody can be administered to a subject in association with a second anti-IGFR1 antibody or a small molecule IGFR1 antagonist. The present invention provides, inter alia, such treatments and compositions for use in the treatments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides combinations and methods for treating medical conditions that are characterized by a high level of IGFR1 expression, iigand binding or activity or a high level of IGF-1 or IGF-2, such as cancer. The combinations of the invention, which can be used to treat the medical conditions, include one or more anti-IGFR1 antibodies (e.g., an isolated fully-human monoclonal antibody) in association with one or more chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The combinations of the invention include the binding composition component and chemotherapeutic agent component “in association” with one another. The term “in<br><br>
association” indicates that the components of the combinations of the invention can be formulated into a single composition for simultaneous delivery or formulated separately into two or more compositions (e.g., a kit). Furthermore, each component of a combination of the invention can be administered to a subject at a different time than when the other component is administered; for example, each administration may be given non-simultaneously at several intervals over a given period of time. Moreover, the separate components may be administered to a subject by the same or by a different route (e.g., orally, intravenously, intratumorally).<br>
The compositions of the invention provide a particularly effective means for treating diseases mediated by IGFR1, IGF-1 and/or lGF-2. The therapeutic efficacy of both the binding composition of the invention and the chemotherapeutic agent(s), when administered in association, is far superior to that of either component alone.<br>
The present invention includes any isolated nucleic acid or isolated polypeptide (e.g., an isolated fully-human monoclonal antibody) which comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) of any of the nucleic acids or polypeptides (including mature fragments thereof) set forth, below, in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Molecular Biology<br>
In accordance with the present invention there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch &amp; Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York {herein “Sambrook, et a/., 1989”); DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Volumes I and II (D.N. Glover ed. 1985); Oligonucleotide Synthesis (M J. Gait ed. 1984); Nucleic Acid Hybridization (B.D. Hames &amp; S.J. Higgins eds. (1985)); Transcription And Translation (B.D. Hames &amp; S.J. Higgins, eds. (1984)); Animal Cell Culture (R.I. Freshney, ed. (1986)); Immobilized Cells And Enzymes (IRL Press, (1986)); B. Perbal, A Practical Guide To Molecular Cloning (1984); F.M. Ausubel, et a/, (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1994).<br>
A “polynucleotide”, “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” may refer to the phosphate ester polymeric form of ribonucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, uridine or cytidine; “RNA molecules”) or deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, deoxythymidine, or deoxycytidine; “DNA molecules”), or any phosphoester analogs thereof, such as phosphorothioates and thioesters, in single stranded form, double-stranded form or otherwise.<br>
A “polynucleotide sequence”, “nucleic acid sequence” or “nucleotide sequence” is a series of nucleotide bases (also called “nucleotides”) in a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, and means any chain of two or more nucleotides.<br>
A “coding sequence” or a sequence “encoding” an expression product, such as a RNA, polypeptide, protein, or enzyme, is a nucleotide sequence that, when expressed, results in production of the product.<br>
The term “gene” means a DNA sequence that codes for or corresponds to a particular sequence of ribonucleotides or amino acids which comprise all or part of one or more RNA molecules, proteins or enzymes, and may or may not include regulatory DNA sequences, such as promoter sequences, which determine, for example, the conditions<br><br>
under which the gene is expressed. Genes may be transcribed from DNA to RNA which may or may not be translated into an amino acid sequence.<br>
“Amplification” of DNA as used herein may denote the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase the concentration of a particular DNA sequence within a mixture of DNA sequences. For a description of PCR see Saiki, et a/., Science (1988) 239:487. In a specific embodiment, the present invention includes a nucleic acid, which encodes an anti-IGFR1 antibody, an anti-IGFR1 antibody heavy or light chain, an anti-IGFR1 antibody heavy or light chain variable region, an anti-IGFR1 antibody heavy or light chain constant region or anti-IGFR1 antibody CDR {e.g., CDR- L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2 or CDR-H3) which can be amplified by PCR.<br>
As used herein, the term “oligonucleotide” refers to a nucleic add, generally of at least 10 (e.g., 10,11,12,13 or 14), preferably at least 15 (e.g., 15,16,17,18 or 19), and more preferably at least 20 nucleotides (e.g., 20, 21,22, 23, 24, 25,26, 27,28, 29 or 30), preferably no more than 100 nucleotides (e.g., 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90), that may be hybridizable to a genomic DNA molecule, a cDNA molecule, or an mRNA molecule encoding a gene, mRNA, cDNA, or other nucleic acid of interest. Oligonucleotides can be labeled, e.g., by incorporation of 32P-nucleotides, 3H-nucleotides, 14C-nucleotides, 35S-nucleotides or nucleotides to which a label, such as biotin, has been covalently conjugated. In one embodiment, a labeled oligonucleotide can be used as a probe to detect the presence of a nucleic acid. In another embodiment, oligonucleotides (one or both of which may be labeled) can be used as PCR primers, either for cloning full length or a fragment of the gene, or to detect the presence of nucleic acids. Generally, oligonucleotides are prepared synthetically, preferably on a nucleic acid synthesizer.<br>
The sequence of any nucleic acid (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding an 1GFR1 gene or a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IGFR1 antibody or a fragment or portion thereof) may be determined by any method known in the art (e.g., chemical sequencing or enzymatic sequencing). “Chemical sequencing” of DNA may denote methods such as that of Maxam and Gilbert (1977) (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:560), in which DNA is randomly cleaved using individual base-specific reactions. “Enzymatic sequencing” of DNA may denote methods such as that of Sanger (Sanger, et a/., (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:5463).<br>
The nucleic adds herein may be flanked by natural regulatory (expression control) sequences, or may be associated with heterologous sequences, including promoters, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and other ribosome binding site sequences,<br><br>
enhancers, response elements, suppressors, signal sequences, polyadenylation sequences, introns, 5- and 3’- non-coding regions, and the like.<br>
A “promoter” or “promoter sequence” is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding an RNA polymerase in a cell (e.g., directly or through other promoter-bound proteins or substances) and initiating transcription of a coding sequence (e.g., LCF or HCA). A promoter sequence is, in general, bounded at its 3’ terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5’ direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at any level. Within the promoter sequence may be found a transcription initiation site {conveniently defined, for example, by mapping with nuclease S1), as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. The promoter may be operably associated with other expression control sequences, including enhancer and repressor sequences or with a nucleic acid of the invention. Promoters which may be used to control gene expression include, but are not limited to, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,385,839 and 5,168,062), the SV40 early promoter region (Benoist, et a/., (1981) Nature 290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3’ long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto, et a/., (1980) Cell 22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner, et a/., (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster, et a/., (1982) Nature 296:39-42); prokaryotic expression vectors such as the p-lactamase promoter (Villa-Komaroff, et a/., (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:3727-3731), or the tac promoter (DeBoer, et a/., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:21-25); see also “Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria” in Scientific American (1980) 242:74-94; and promoter elements from yeast or other fungi such as the Gal 4 promoter, the ADC (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter, PGK (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter or the alkaline phosphatase promoter.<br>
A coding sequence is “under the control of, “functionally associated with” or “operably associated with” transcriptional and translational control sequences in a cell when the sequences direct RNA polymerase mediated transcription of the coding sequence into RNA, preferably mRNA, which then may be trans-RNA spliced (if it contains introns) and, optionally, translated into a protein encoded by the coding sequence.<br>
The terms “express” and “expression” mean allowing or causing the information in a gene, RNA or DNA sequence to become manifest; for example, producing a protein by activating the cellular functions involved in transcription and translation of a corresponding<br><br>
gene. A DNA sequence is expressed in or by a cell to form an “expression product” such as an RNA (e.g., mRNA) or a protein. The expression product itself may also be said to be “expressed” by the cell.<br>
The terms “vector”, “cloning vector” and “expression vector” mean the vehicle (e.g., a plasmid) by which a DNA or RNA sequence can be introduced into a host cell, so as to transform the host and, optionally, promote expression and/or replication of the introduced sequence.<br>
The term “transfection” or “transformation” means the introduction of a nucleic acid into a cell. These terms may refer to the introduction of a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IGFR1 antibody or fragment thereof into a cell. The introduced gene or sequence may be called a “clone”. A host cell that receives the introduced DNA or RNA has been “transformed” and is a “transformant” or a “clone”. The DNA or RNA introduced to a host cell can come from any source, including cells of the same genus or species as the host cell, or cells of a different genus or species.<br>
The term “host cell” means any cell of any organism that is selected, modified, transfected, transformed, grown, or used or manipulated in any way, for the production of a substance by the cell, for example the expression or replication, by the cell, of a gene, a DNA or RNA sequence, a protein or an enzyme.<br>
The term “expression system” means a host cell and compatible vector which, i under suitable conditions, can express a protein or nucleic acid which is carried by the vector and introduced to the host cell. Common expression systems include E. coii host cells and plasmid vectors, insect host cells and Baculovirus vectors, and mammalian host cells and vectors. In a specific embodiment, IGFR1 or an antibody and antigen-binding fragment of the invention may be expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Other suitable cells include CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells and NSO cells (non-lg-producing murine myeloma cell line). Nucleic acids encoding an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention, sIGFRI (see infra) or IGFR1 may be expressed at high levels in an E.co///T7 expression system as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,952,496, 5,693,489 and 5,869,320 and in Davanloo, P., etaL, (1984) Proc. i Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 2035-2039; Studier, F. W., et a/., (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189:113-130; Rosenberg, A. H., et a/., (1987) Gene 56:125-135; and Dunn, J. J„ et a/., (1988) Gene 68:259 which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention contemplates any superficial or slight modification to the amino add or nucleotide sequences which correspond to the antibodies or antigen-<br><br>
binding fragments of the invention. In particular, the present invention contemplates sequence conservative variants of the nucleic acids which encode the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention. “Sequence-conservative variants” of a polynucleotide sequence are those in which a change of one or more nucleotides in a given codon results in no alteration in the amino acid encoded at that position. Function-conservative variants of the antibodies of the invention are also contemplated by the present invention. “Function-conservative variants” are those in which one or more amino acid residues in a protein or enzyme have been changed without altering the overall conformation and function of the polypeptide, including, but, by no means, limited to, replacement of an amino acid with one having similar properties. Amino acids with similar properties are well known in the art. For example, polar/hydrophilic amino acids which may be interchangeable include asparagine, glutamine, serine, cysteine, threonine, lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid; nonpolar/hydrophobic amino acids which may be interchangeable include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine; acidic amino acids which may be interchangeable include aspartic acid and glutamic acid and basic amino acids which may be interchangeable include histidine, lysine and arginine.<br>
The present invention includes anti-IGFRI antibodies and fragments thereof which are encoded by nucleic acids as described in Table 1 as well as nucleic acids which hybridize thereto. Preferably, the nucleic acids hybridize under low stringency conditions, more preferably under moderate stringency conditions and most preferably under high stringency conditions and, preferably, exhibit IGFR1 binding activity. A nucleic acid molecule is “hybridizable” to another nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA, when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid molecule can anneal to the other nucleic acid molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook, et a/., supra). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the “stringency” of the hybridization. Typical low stringency hybridization conditions include 55°C, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and no formamide; or 30% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42°C. Typical, moderate stringency hybridization conditions are similar to the low stringency conditions except the hybridization is carried out in 40% formamide, with 5X or 6X SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 42°C. High stringency hybridization conditions are similar to low stringency conditions except the hybridization conditions are carried out in 50% formamide, 5X or 6X SSC at 42°C or, optionally, at a higher temperature (e.g., 57 °C, 59 °C, 60 °C, 62 °C, 63 °C, 65°C or 68 °C). In general,<br><br>
SSC is 0.15M NaC1 and 0.015M Na-citrate. Hybridization requires that the two nucleic adds contain complementary sequences, although, depending on the stringency of the hybridization, mismatches between bases are possible. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing nucleic acids depends on the length of the nucleic acids and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the higher the stringency under which the nucleic acids may hybridize. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating the melting temperature have been derived (see Sambrook, et a/., supra, 9.50-9.51). For hybridization with shorter nucleic acids, i.e., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook, et a/., supra, 11.7-11.8).<br>
Also included in the present invention are nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences and polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences which are at least about 70% identical, preferably at least about 80% identical, more preferably at least about 90% identical and most preferably at least about 95% identical (e.g., 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) to the reference nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Table 1 when the comparison is performed by a BLAST algorithm wherein the parameters of the algorithm are selected to give the largest match between the respective sequences over the entire length of the respective reference sequences. Polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences which are at least about 70% similar, preferably at least about 80% similar, more preferably at least about 90% similar and most preferably at least about 95% similar (e.g., 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) to any of the reference amino acid sequences of Table 1 when the comparison is performed with a BLAST algorithm wherein the parameters of the algorithm are selected to give the largest match between the respective sequences over the entire length of the respective reference sequences, are also included in the present invention.<br>
Sequence identity refers to exact matches between the nucleotides or amino acids of two sequences which are being compared. Sequence similarity refers to both exact matches between the amino acids of two polypeptides which are being compared in addition to matches between nonidentical, biochemically related amino acids. Biochemically related amino acids which share similar properties and may be interchangeable are discussed above.<br>

Antibody Structure<br>
In general, the basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain may include a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino adds primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-termina! portion of each chain may define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody’s isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a D” region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).<br><br>
The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in Afunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.<br>
Normally, the chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is, generally, in accordance with the definitions of Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest.

Binding Compositions<br>
The binding compositions of the combinations of the present invention include any composition which binds specifically to IGFR1. A binding composition or agent refers to a molecule that binds with specificity to IGFR1, e.g., in a ligand-receptor type fashion or an antibody-antigen interaction, e.g., proteins which specifically associate with IGFR1, e.g., in a natural physiologically relevant protein-protein interaction, either covalent or non-covalent. The term “binding composition” includes small organic molecules, nucleic acids and polypeptides, such as a full antibody (preferably an isolated monoclonal human antibody) or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention (e.g., antibody 19D12/15H12, antibody 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA or any peptide set forth, above, in Table<br>

All restrictions on access to the plasmids deposited in ATCC will be removed upon grant of a patent.<br>
Each of the above-referenced plasmids constitutes part of the present invention. Further, the nucleic acid located within each expression cassette, along with the immunoglobulin variable region therein, along with the mature, processed version thereof (/.e, lacking the signal sequence), particularly, SEQ ID NO: 3, mature HCA (nucleotides 58-411 of SEQ ID NO: 3), SEQ ID NO: 1 or mature LCF (nucleotides 58-384 of SEQ ID NO: 1), optionally including an immunoglobulin constant region, along with any polypeptide encoded by any of the foregoing nucleic acids, including mature or unprocessed chains, optionally including an immunoglobulin constant region, is a part of the present invention. Moreover, any antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprising one of the encoded polypeptides is part of the present invention.<br>
The scope of the present invention includes antibody variable regions of the present invention (e.g., any variable region, mature or unprocessed, indicated in Table 1) linked to any immunoglobulin constant region. If a light chain variable region is linked to a constant region, preferably it is a K chain. If a heavy chain variable region is linked to a constant region, preferably it is a y1, y2, y3 or y4 constant region, more preferably, y1, y2 or y4 and even more preferably y1 or y4.<br>
The anti-IGFRI antibody molecules of the invention preferably recognize human IGFR1, preferably a soluble fragment of IGFR1 (/.e„ sIGFRI) such as amino acids 30-902 or SEQ ID NO: 11; however, the present invention includes antibody molecules which recognize IGFR1 from different species, preferably mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep or dog).<br>
The present invention also includes an anti-IGFR1 antibody (e.g., LCF/HCA) or antigen-binding fragments thereof which are complexed with IGFR1 or any fragment thereof (e,g.f sIGFRI, such as amino acids 30-902 of SEQ ID NO: 11) or with any cell which is expressing IGFR1 or any portion or fragment thereof on the cell surface (e.g., HEK293 cells stably transformed with human IGFR1 or MCF7 (e.g., ATCC Cell Line No.<br><br>
HTB-22)). Such complexes may be made by contacting the antibody or antibody fragment with IGFR1 or the IGFR1 fragment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, fully-human monoclonal antibodies directed against IGFR1 are generated using transgenic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic mice, which may be referred to, herein, as TiuMAb” mice, contain a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encodes unrearranged human heavy []x and y) and K light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p. and K chain loci (Lonberg, N., ef a/., (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse lgM or K, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgGK monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N., ef a/., (1994), supra] reviewed in Lonberg, N. (1994) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113:49-101; Lonberg, N., ef a/., (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93, and Harding, F., ef a/., (1995) Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci 764:536-546). The preparation of HuMab mice is commonly known in the art and is described, for example, in Taylor, L„ ef a/., (1992) Nucleic Acids Research 20:6287-6295; Chen, J., et aL, (1993) International Immunology 5: 647-656; Tuaillon, ef a/., (1993) Proc.

WO 98/24884; WO 94/25585; WO 93/12227; WO 92/22645 and WO 92/03918 the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entity.<br>
To generate fully human, monoclonal antibodies to IGFR1, HuMab mice can be immunized with an antigenic 1GFR1 polypeptide, preferably amino acids 30-902 of SEQ ID NO: 11, as described by Lonberg, N., ef a/., (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859; Fishwiid, D., ef a/., (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14: 845-851 and WO 98/24884.<br><br>
Preferably, the mice will be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified preparation of 1GFR1 or sIGFRI can be used to immunize the HuMab mice intraperitoneally. The mice can also be immunized with whole HEK293 cells which are stably transfected with an IGFR1 gene. An “antigenic IGFR1 polypeptide” may refer to an IGFR1 polypeptide of any fragment thereof, preferably amino acids 30-902 of SEQ ID NO: 11, which elicits an anti-IGFR1 immune response, preferably in HuMab mice.<br>
In general, HuMAb transgenic mice respond well when initially immunized intraperitoneally (IP) with antigen in complete Freund’s adjuvant, followed by every other week IP immunizations (usually, up to a total of 6) with antigen in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Mice can be immunized, first, with cells expressing IGFR1 (e.g., stably transfected HEK293 cells), then with a soluble fragment of IGFR1 (e.g., amino acids 30-902 of SEQ ID NO: 11) and continually receive alternating immunizations with the two antigens. The immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma can be screened for the. presence of antMGFRI antibodies, for example by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of immunoglobulin can be used for fusions. Mice can be boosted intravenously with antigen 3 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. It is expected that 2-3 fusions for each antigen may need to be performed. Several mice can be immunized for each antigen. For example, a total of twelve HuMAb mice of the HC07 and HC012 strains can be immunized.<br>
Hybridoma cells which produce the monoclonal, fully human antMGFRI antibodies may be produced by methods which are commonly known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler, et a/., (1975) (Nature 256:495-497), as well as the trioma technique (Hering, et a/., (1988) Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 47:211-216 and Hagiwara, et al„ (1993) Hum. Antibod. Hybridomas 4:15), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor, et a/., (1983) Immunology Today 4:72 and Cote, et a/., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 80:2026-2030), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole, et a/., in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96,1985). Preferably, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line based upon standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice may by fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63- Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells may be plated at<br><br>
approximately 2 x 105 cells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% “653” conditioned media, 5% origen (IGEN), 4 mM L~glutamine, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1X HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks, cells may be cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells may then be screened by ELISA for human anti-IGFR1 monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas may be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-IGFR1 monoclonal antibodies, can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones may then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.<br>
The anti-IGFRI antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention may also be produced recombinantly (e.g., in an E.oolim expression system as discussed above). In this embodiment, nucleic acids encoding the antibody molecules of the invention (e.g., VH or VL) may be inserted into a pET-based plasmid and expressed in the E.coiim system. There are several methods by which to produce recombinant antibodies which are known in the art. One example of a method for recombinant production of antibodies is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567, which is herein incorporated by reference. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene-mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, biolistic injection and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In addition, nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into mammalian cells by viral vectors. Methods of transforming cells are well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216; 4,912,040; 4,740,461 and 4,959,455.<br>
Anti-IGFR1 antibodies can also be synthesized by any of the methods set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,331,415.<br>
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These include, inter alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO,<br><br>
SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, 3T3 cells, HEK-293 cells and a number of other cell lines. Mammalian host cells include human, mouse, rat, dog, monkey, pig, goat, bovine, horse and hamster ceils. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels. Other ceil lines that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9 cells, amphibian cells, bacteria! cells, plant cells and fungal cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding the heavy chain or antigen-binding portion thereof, the light chain and/or antigen-binding portion thereof are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown.<br>
Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods. Further, expression of antibodies of the invention (or other moieties therefrom) from production cell lines can be enhanced using a number of known techniques. For example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system (the GS system) is a common approach for enhancing expression under certain conditions. The GS system is discussed in whole or part in connection with European Patent Nos. 0 216 846, 0 256 055, and 0 323 997 and European Patent Application No. 89303964.4.<br>
it is likely that antibodies expressed by different cell lines or in transgenic animals will have different glycosylate from each other. However, all antibodies encoded by the nucleic acid molecules provided herein, or comprising the amino acid sequences provided herein are part of the instant invention, regardless of the giycosylation of the antibodies.<br>
The term “monoclonal antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, /.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized by a hybridoma culture, essentially uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being amongst a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. As mentioned above, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention<br><br>
may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler, et a/., (1975) Nature 256: 495.<br>
A polyclonal antibody is an antibody which was produced among or in the presence of one or more other, non-identical antibodies. In general, polyclonal antibodies are produced from a B-!ymphocyte in the presence of several other B-lymphocytes which produced non-identical antibodies. Usually, polyclonal antibodies are obtained directly from an immunized animal.<br>
A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab’ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai, et aL, (1990) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79: 315-321, Kosteiny, et at., (1992) J Immunol. 148:1547-1553. In addition, bispecific antibodies may be formed as “diabodies” (Holiiger, et a/., (1993) PNAS USA 90:6444-6448) or as “Janusins” (Traunecker, et a/., (1991) EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 and Traunecker, et a/., (1992) Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 7:51-52).<br>
The term ‘fully human antibody” refers to an antibody which comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, “mouse antibody” refers to an antibody which comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only.<br>
The present invention includes “chimeric antibodies”- an antibody which comprises a variable region of the present invention fused or chimerized with an antibody region (e.g., constant region) from another, non-human species (e.g., mouse, horse, rabbit, dog, cow, chicken). These antibodies may be used to modulate the expression or activity of IGFR1 in the non-human species.<br>
“Single-chain Fv” or “sFv” antibody fragments have the VH and VL domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. Techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,476,786; 5,132,405 and 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce anti-IGFR1-specific single chain antibodies. For a review of sFv see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, N.Y., pp. 269-315 (1994).<br><br>
“Disulfide stabilized Fv fragments” and “dsFv” refer to antibody molecules comprising a variable heavy chain (VH) and a variable light chain (VL) which are linked by a disulfide bridge.<br>
Antibody fragments within the scope of the present invention also include F(ab)2 fragments which may be produced by enzymatic cleavage of an IgG by, for example, pepsin. Fab fragments may be produced by, for example, reduction of F(ab)2 with dithiothreitol or mercaptoethylamine. A Fab fragment is a VL-CL chain appended to a VH-CHI chain by a disulfide bridge, A F(ab)2 fragment is two Fab fragments which, in turn, are appended by two disulfide bridges. The Fab portion of an F(ab&gt;2 molecule includes a portion of the Fc region between which disulfide bridges are located.<br>
An Fv fragment is a VL or VH region.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are at least five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. lgG-1, lgG-2, lgG-3 and lgG-4; lgA-1 and lgA-2.<br>
The anti-IGFRI antibody molecules of the invention may also be conjugated to a chemical moiety. The chemical moiety may be, inter alia, a polymer, a radionuclide or a cytotoxic factor. Preferably the chemical moiety is a polymer which increases the half-iife of the antibody molecule in the body of a subject. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., PEG with a molecular weight of 2kDa, 5 kDa, 10 kDa, 12kDa, 20 kDa, 30kDa or 40kDa), dextran and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). Lee, et a/., (1999) (Bioconj. Chem. 10:973-981) discloses PEG conjugated single-chain antibodies. Wen, et a/., (2001) (Bioconj. Chem. 12:545-553) disclose conjugating antibodies with PEG which is attached to a radiometal chelator (diethylenetriaminpentaacetic acid (DTPA)).<br>

The antibody molecules may also be conjugated to a cytotoxic factor such as diptheria toxin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modecdn A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins and compounds (e.g., fatty acids), dianthin proteins, Phytolacca americana proteins PAPl, PAPII, and PAP-S, momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, saponaria officinalis inhibitor, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin.<br>
Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody molecules of the invention to the various moieties may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter, et a/., (1962) Nature 144:945; David, et aL, (1974) Biochemistry 13:1014; Pain, et al., (1981) J. Immunol. Meth. 40:219; and Nygren, J., (1982) Histochem. and Cytochem. 30:407. Methods for conjugating antibodies are conventional and very well known in the art.<br>
Chemotherapeutic Agents<br>
The present invention includes combinations and methods comprising one or more binding compositions, such as an anti-IGFR1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in association with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. A chemotherapeutic agent provides a therapeutic effect which is helpful in the treatment of any medical condition being treated by administration of a binding composition of the invention (e.g., LCF/HCA). For example, if a binding composition is administered to treat cancer in a subject (e.g., human), the chemotherapeutic agent(s) provide an additional anti-cancer therapeutic effect or some other therapeutic effect which will improve the subject’s treatment outcome. The chemotherapeutic agent component of a combination of the invention can operate by any mechanism (/.e., by the same mechanism by which the binding composition acts or by a different mechanism). Chemotherapeutic agents in the combinations and methods of the present invention include, but are, by no means, limited to, signal transduction inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, IGF/IGFR1 system modulators (e.g., inhibitors or activators), farnesyl protein transferase (FPT) inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, HER2 inhibitors, vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitors, mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors, MEK<br><br>

Antisense oligonucleotides can be produced that are complementary to the mRNA of the IGFR1, IGF-1 or lGF-2 gene and can be used to inhibit transcription or translation of the genes. Production of antisense oligonucleotides effective for therapeutic uses is well known in the art. Antisense oligonucleotides are often produced using derivatized or modified nucleotides in order to increase half-life or bioavailability. The primary sequence of the IGFR1, IGF-1 or IGF-2 gene can also be used to design ribozymes. Most synthetic ribozymes are generally hammerhead, tetrahymena and haripin ribozymes. Methods of designing and using ribozymes to cleave specific RNA species are well known in the art.<br><br>

Categorization of a particular agent into a particular class (e.g., FPT inhibitor or microtubule stabilizer) is only done for descriptive purposes and is not meant to limit the invention in any way.<br>
The scope of present invention includes compositions and methods comprising an ant-IGFR antibody along with one or more of the foregoing chemotherapeutic agents or any salt, hydrate, isomer, formulation, solvate or prodrug thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
A combination, or any component thereof, of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition, along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, suitable for administration to a subject in vivo. The scope of the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions which may be administered to a subject by any route, such as a non-parenteral (e.g., oral, ocular, topical or pulmonary (inhalation)) or a parenteral route (e.g., intratumoral injection, intravenous injection, intraarterial injection, subcutaneous injection or intramuscular injection). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise an antibody comprising 15H12/19D12 LCF and 15H12/19D12 HCAin association with one or more chemotherapeutic agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
As stated above, the combinations of the invention include the binding composition component and chemotherapeutic agent component “in association” with one another. The term “in association’ indicates that the components of the combinations of the invention can be formulated into a single composition for simultaneous delivery or formulated separately into two or more compositions (e.g., a kit). For example, the scope of the present invention includes combinations comprising an anti-IGFR1 antibody formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous) to a subject and a chemotherapeutic agent formulated for oral delivery (e.g., pill, tablet, capsule). Alternatively, both components of the combination can be formulated, separately or together, for parenteral delivery or non-parenteral delivery (e.g., oral).<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may include additives and carriers such as starch (e.g., potato, maize or wheat starch or cellulose), starch derivatives (e.g., microcrystalline cellulose or silica), sugars (e.g., lactose), talc, lactose, stearate, magnesium carbonate or calcium phosphate. In order to ensure that oral compositions are well tolerated by the patient’s digestive system, mucus formers or resins may be included. It may also be desirable to improve tolerance by formulating in a capsule which<br><br>
is insoluble in the gastric juices. An exemplary pharmaceutical composition of this invention in the form of a capsule is prepared by filling a standard two-piece hard gelatin capsule with the combination of the invention or any component thereof in powdered form, lactose, talc and magnesium stearate. Oral administration of immunoglobulins has been described (Foster, et a/., (2001) Cochrane Database System rev. 3:CD001816)<br>
A combination of the invention or any component thereof (e.g., binding composition and/or chemotherapeutic agent) may also be included in a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration. Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site where treatment is required, such as liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose.<br>
Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the combination of the invention or any component thereof (e.g., binding composition and/or chemotherapeutic agent) in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and preferably including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration.<br>
Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile, aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil.<br>
Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semi-solid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the combination of the invention or any component thereof in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy basis. The basis may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, com, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives, or a fatty acid such as stearic or oleic add together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or macrogels. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surface active such as sorbitan esters or polyoxyethylene derivatives thereof. Suspending agents such as<br><br>
natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic materials such as sllicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included.<br>
A combination of the invention or any component thereof (e.g., binding composition and/or chemotherapeutic agent) may also be administered by inhalation. A suitable pharmaceutical composition for inhalation may be an aerosol. An exemplary pharmaceutical composition for inhalation of a combination of the invention or any component thereof may include: an aerosol container with a capacity of 15-20 ml comprising the active ingredient (e.g., binding composition and/or chemotherapeutic agent), a lubricating agent, such as polysorbate 85 or oleic acid, dispersed in a propellant, such as freon, preferably in a combination of 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane and difluorochloromethane. Preferably, the composition is in an appropriate aerosol container adapted for either intranasal or oral inhalation administration.<br>
Dosage<br>
Preferably, a combination of the invention is administered to a subject at a “therapeutically effective dosage” or “therapeutically effective amount” which preferably inhibits a disease or condition (e.g., tumor growth) to any extent-preferably by at least about 20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and still more preferably by at least about 80%-100% relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a combination of the invention or any component thereof to inhibit cancer can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human tumors. Alternatively, this property can be evaluated by examining the ability of a combination of the invention or any component thereof to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro by assays well-known to the skilled practitioner. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject’s size, the severity of the subject’s symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.<br>
Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a dose may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For<br><br>
example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. The effectiveness of a given dose or treatment regimen of an antibody or combination of the invention can be determined, for example, by determining whether a tumor being treated in the subject shrinks or ceases to grow- The size of tumor can be easily determined, for example, by X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MR!) or visually in a surgical procedure.<br>
In general, a suitable daily dose of a combination of the invention or any component thereof may be that amount which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. It is preferred that administration be by injection, preferably proximal to the site of the target (e.g., tumor). If desired, a therapeutically effective daily dose of an antibody or antibody/chemotherapeutic agent combination of the invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day. In an embodiment, a “therapeutically effective” dosage of any anti-IGFR antibody of the present invention is in the range of about 3 mg/kg (body weight) to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., 3,4, 5,6,7, 8, 9 or 10 mg/kg) per day. In an embodiment, a “therapeutically effective dosage” of a chemotherapeutic agent is as set forth in the Physicians’ Desk Reference 2003 (Thomson Healthcare; 57th edition (November 1, 2002)) which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, in an embodiment, the daily dose of gefitinib is 250 mg/day or the daily dose of paclitaxel is about 135 mg/m2 to about 175 mg/m2.<br>
Therapeutic Methods and Administration<br>
A combination of the invention or an anti-IGFR antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention, alone, can be used to inhibit or reduce the growth or proliferation of any cell, such as a malignant cell, either in vitro (e.g., in cell culture) or in vivo (e.g., within the body of a subject suffering from a disease mediated by elevated expression or activity of IGFR1 or by elevated expression of its ligand (e.g., IGF-I or IGF-II)). Such inhibition or reduction of growth or proliferation of a cell can be achieved by contacting the cell with the combination.<br>
A combination of the invention or an anti-IGFR antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, alone, of the invention can be used for treating or preventing any<br><br>
disease or condition in a subject in need of such treatment or prevention which is mediated, for example, by elevated expression or activity of 1GFR1 or by elevated expression of its ligand (e.g., IGF-I or IGF-II) and which may be treated or prevented by modulation of IGFR1 ligand binding, activity or expression. Preferably, the disease or condition is mediated by an increased level of IGFR1, IGF-I or IGF-II and is treated or prevented by decreasing IGFR1 ligand binding, activity (e.g., autophosphorylation activity) or expression. Preferably, the disease or condition is malignancy, more preferably a malignancy characterized by a tumor which expresses IGFR1, such as, but not limited to, bladder cancer, Wilm’s cancer, bone cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, synovial sarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diarrhea associated with metastatic carcinoid and vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting tumors (e.g., VIPoma or Werner-Morrison syndrome). Acromegaly may also be treated with a combination of the invention. Antagonism of IGF-I has been reported for treatment of acromegaly (Drake, et a/., (2001) Trends Endocrin. Metab. 12:408-413). Other non-malignant medical conditions which may also be treated, in a subject, by administering a combination of the invention, include gigantism, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, smooth muscle restenosis of blood vessels or inappropriate microvascular proliferation, such as that found as a complication of diabetes, especially of the eye rheumatoid arthritis, Grave’s disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Myasthenia Gravis, auto-immune thyroiditis and Bechefs disease.<br>
The term “subject!” may refer to any organism, preferably an animal, more preferably a mammal (e.g., rat, mouse, dog, cat, rabbit) and most preferably a human.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, where possible, a composition of the invention is administered to a subject in accordance with the Physicians1 Desk Reference 2003 (Thomson Healthcare; 57th edition (November 1,2002)).<br>
A combination of the invention or any component thereof can be administered by an invasive route such as by injection (see above). Administration by a non-invasive route (e.g., orally; for example, in a pill, capsule or tablet) is also within the scope of the present invention. In an embodiment of the invention, an anti-IGFR antibody of the invention, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, is administered intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraarterialiy or intratumorally while a chemotherapeutic agent of the invention (e.g., gefitinib (e.g., Iressa™)) is administered orally in tablet form.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is paclitaxel (e.g., Taxol®) which is administered intravenously.<br>
Compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be administered by injection with a hypodermic needle.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device; such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,620,135; 6,096,002; 5,399,163; 5,383,851; 5,312,335; 5,064,413; 4,941,880; 4,790,824 or 4,596,556.<br>

No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Kits<br>
The present invention also provides kits comprising the components of the combinations of the invention in kit form. A kit of the present invention includes one or more components including, but not limited to, a binding composition, as discussed herein, which specifically binds IGFR1 (e.g., 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA) in assodation with one or more additional components including, but not limited to, a chemotherapeutic agent, as discussed herein. The binding composition and/or the chemotherapeutic agent can be formulated as a pure composition or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, in a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In one embodiment, a kit includes a binding composition of the invention (e.g., 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof in one container (e.g., in a sterile glass or plastic vial) and a chemotherapeutic agent or a pharmaceutical composition thereof in another container (e.g., in a sterile glass or plastic vial).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the kit comprises a combination of the invention, including a binding composition component (e.g., 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA) along with a chemotherapeutic agent component formulated together, optionally, along<br><br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, in a pharmaceutical composition, in a single, common container.<br>
- If the kit indudes a pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration to a subject, the kit can indude a device for performing such administration. For example, the lot can indude one or more hypodermic needles or other injection devices as discussed above.<br>

Generally, such information aids patients and physidans in using the endosed pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms effectively and safely. For example, the following information regarding a combination of the invention may be supplied in the insert: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, dinical studies, efficacy parameters, indications and usage, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, overdosage, proper dosage and administration, how supplied, proper storage conditions, references, manufacturer/distributor information and patent information.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided to further describe the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Example 1: Proliferation Assay Using an Anti-IGFRI Antibody and a Chemotherapeutic Agent<br>
The ability of cells in culture to proliferate when exposed to varying concentrations of the19D12/15H12 wild-type or 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA anti-IGFR1 antibody and either paditaxel, gefitinib, lonafarnib 4-hydroxy tamoxifen or doxorubicin was evaluated in this example.<br>
Cell Preparation. H322 NSCLC cells or MCF7 cells were cultured for several passages no greater than 80% confluency in T-75 TC treated filtered flasks. The cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 25000 cells/ml in 10% HI-FBS (heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) RPMI medium containing NEAA (non-essential amino adds), L-Glu, MEM Vitamins and PS. 100ul of cell suspension (2500 cells) was added to each well of a BD Falcon 96 well black, dear bottom TC treated plate. The cells were allowed to attach and spread overnight at 37°C. The 10% RPMI solution<br><br>
was replaced with 100μl RPMI containing 2% HI-FBS containing NEAA, L-Glu, MEM Vitamins and PS,<br>
Solution Preparation. All assay reagents were prepared in RPMI containing 2% HI-FBS at 20X concentration and serial diluted for a total of 10 test concentrations per treatment. Every test point was prepared in triplicate on separate assay plates. Each plate included experimental wells containing either (i) antibody 19D12/15H12 and paclitaxel, (ii) antibody 19D12/15H12 and gefitinib; (Hi) antibody 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA and lonafamib; (rv) antibody 19D12/15H12 and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen; or (v) antibody 19D12/15H12 and doxorubicin along with internal controls of containing either (a) no treatment (b) reagentl (paclitaxel, gefitinib, lonafamib, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen or doxorubicin) alone, and (c) antibody 19D12/15H12 or 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA alone.<br>
Reagent 1 and 19D12/15H12 or 19D12/15H12 LCF/HCA were set up individually as dose responses as well as in combination with each other. Cell proliferation was measured on Day4.<br>
Assay. Cell proliferation was measured using the Promega Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega Corp.; Madison, Wl). This assay provided a method for determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP in the culture, which indicates the presence of metabolically active cells.<br>
The assay reagents and assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature and prepared immediately before addition to the assay plates. One volume of assay reagent was added to each well of the assay plate and shaken on an orbital platform for at least ten minutes to allow for equilibration of the ATP reaction and to ensure total lysis of all cells in the assay plate. The reaction had a half-life of five hours but in no case was reading done later than 30 minutes after addition of reagent. Luminescence was detected on Wallac 420 Plate Reader with stacker.<br>
The results from these experiments are shown below in Tables 2-6. The units in the tables (proliferation index) are arbitrary and are proportional to the number of viable cells observed in the culture under each respective condition. The data from the “no treatment” experiments indicate the proliferation index observed in the absence of any drug (/.e, antibody or chemotherapeutic composition).<br>
In Tables 2-6, “ug” indicates micrograms and “uM” indicates micromolar.<br><br>

Example 2: In vivo tumor inhibition assay of anti-IGFR and paclitaxei using a NSCLC xenograft model H322.<br>
In this example, the effectiveness of an anti-IGFR/pacIitaxei combination of the invention for tumor growth inhibition was demonstrated in vivo.<br>
Five million H322 human NSCLC cells in Matrigel were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. Anti-IGFR antibody 19D12 and/or paclitaxei treatment was initiated when the tumor size reached ~105-115 mm3 at day 0. Both 19D12 and paclitaxei were dosed twice per week. Anti-IGFR antibody 19D12 was dosed at 0.5 mg per mouse. Paclitaxei was at 15 mpk. Ten animals per group. Tumor volumes were measured by Labcat<br><br>
