THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (gee Section 10, rule 13)<br>
CARDING ENGINE<br>
HOLLINGSWORTH GMEH of ROSENSTRASSE 7-9,  75387 NEUBULACH, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Carding Engine<br>
A carding engine of this kind serves the purpose of parallelizing of fibers, particularly cotton fibers. The fibers are guided on a "Tambour" [drum] in bundles oriented lengthwise and the fibers lie on the jacket surface of the drum. The ' lambour" has a shape of a cylindrical roller, which is suspended in horizontal position.<br>
The fibers guided in the circumferential direction on the "Tambour" are held in fittings which are fixed on a carding rail guided through a system of rollers. The individual fittings consist of flexible strip like fabric linings, on whose top side comb structures are formed in the shape of metallic needle combs.<br>
The fittings run in lengthwise direction of the "tambour" closely on the top of its surface, so that due to comb structures the fibers are combed and oriented lengthwise.<br>
Here each fitting is fixed on a cover column, wherein the dimensions of the cover columns are matched with the dimensions of the fittings. The cover columns along with the fittings are guided at the carding rail.<br>
In case of known carding engines the fittings are located on the topside of the cover columns. Here the cover columns are widened at the top ends and have the form of profiles with rectangular cross section, wherein the fittings are located acij 'he entire upper front side of the profiles. For fixing purpose on the side walls sheet metal parts placed or similar other arrangement is made. These metal parts project somewhat above the top edge of the profiles with fittings and above<br><br>
the lower edge of the profiles. Through flanging the projecting ends of the metal parts are bent so that these rest on the top and bottom sides of profiles and thus fix the respective fitting to a profile.<br>
The individual fittings are relatively prone to wear, so that these need to replaced within the specified time intervals. For this purpose the fittings along with permanently joined cover columns are dismantled from the carding rails. Then these are mechanically processed in work shops or service stations to remove fittings fixed with cover columns by flanging. Thereafter, new fittings are brought on the cover columns and fixed by flanging of new metal parts placed on sideways.<br>
One disadvantage here is that the mounting expenditure for replacement of fittings is very high. Particularly, the disadvantage is that the change of fitting requires suitable mechanical tools, which means the replacement cannot be carried out at site on the carding engine, but must be carried out in mechanical workshops or service stations. Therefore, for changing the fittings one must bear not only assembly time but also considerable transport time and costs.<br>
The invention is based on the task of developing carding engine as mentioned in the beginning in such a way that as far as possible easy replacement of fittings can be made possible.<br>
For resolving this task the features of the claim 1 are planned. Advantageous design forms and appropriate further development of the invention are described in the sub-claims. According to the invention the fittings are joined one each with cover column through fixing media, wherein the fixing media can removed in reverse position.<br><br>
The major advantage here is offered by the fact that through this kind of fixing the fittings at the cover columns can be easily and quickly replaced with simple tools at site on the carding engine. Here particular advantage is that fixing media can be used on cover columns as being removal in reverse, so that after replacement of a fitting the same fixing media can be used again.<br>
In a particularly advantageous design form of the invention the fittings are fixed on a rigid base like for example on a sheet metal piece.<br>
The sheet metal part together with the fitting forms a rigid shaped assembly unit, which can be easily mounted at a cover column as flexible. Particularly, in this arrangement, the flexible fitting is protected against distortion or mechanical damages. Another advantage is that the form stable assembly unit consisting of the base and the fitting can be positioned securely and easily on the cover column, whereby mounting on the cover column is considerably simplified.<br>
The fixing media for fixing of a fitting at the cover column can be made up in a preferred design form of clips. In this case the fitting along with the base lies on the top portion of the front side on the cover column. The clips can then be locked on the side at the cover column and on the fittings.<br>
In another advantageous design form the fixing media are formed as guides in the cover columns, in which fittings can be introduced, which are fixed on the bases.<br>
The invention is explained as follows on the basis of drawings. Following figures are shown<br><br>
Figure 1: Schematic representation of a carding engine for parallelizing of fibers<br>
Figure 2: Cut out of a carding engine as per Fig.l along with fittings engaged with  fibers and fixed to the cover columns<br>
Figure 3a, b: First and second design example of a base for admitting a fitting<br>
Figure 4: First design example of fixing media for fixing of a fitting to a cover column<br>
Figure 5: second design example of fixing media for fixing of a fitting to a cover column<br>
Figure 2 shows a design example of a carding engine 1 for parallelizing of fiber 1, particularly cotton fibers.<br>
The carding engine 1 has a "Tambour" 3, which is made up in the form of a cylindrical roller, whose longitudinal axis lies in horizontal direction. The "tambour" [drum] is suspended around a rotating axis rurming across longitudinal axis and is driven in rotary movement by means of a drive not shown here.<br>
On the topside of the jacket surface of the drum 3 joins a carding rail 4, which driven by a roller system. The rollers 5 of the roller system are arranged such that via an angular segment of nearly 180° the carding rail 4 is guided to a short distance to jacket surface and runs in the circumferential direction of the tambour<br>
3.<br><br>
Via a guiding fixture with a guide shoe 6 the fibers 2 are guided on the Tambour 3. The fibers 2 are guided as fiber bundle in the circumferential direction as lying on the jacket surface of the Tambour 3.<br>
As is apparent from cut out of the carding engine 1 shown in Fig.2 the fibers 2 are guided between the jacket surface of the Tambour 3 and fittings 8 suspended at the cover columns 7. The cover columns 7 are suspended on the carding rails. The fittings 8 are placed at the front side of the cover columns 7.<br>
The cover columns 7 are arranged - as lying in short distance from each other -at the carding rail 4. The longitudinal axes of cover columns 7 run in longitudinal direction of the Tambour 3.<br>
The fittings 8 have nearly the same sizes like the cover columns 7 and consist of strip shaped, long stretched and track shaped fabric linings 9 on whose top side comb structures Ip are there. The comb structures 10 are formed by metallic needle combs, which cover nearly entire surface of the fitting 8.<br>
These comb structures 10 are engaged with the fibers 2 guided on the Tambour 3. Thereby, fibers are combed in lengthwise direction and thus oriented in parallel.<br>
According to the invention for fixing fittings 8 to the cover columns 7 fixing media are planned, which can be removed as reversible and thus have an advantage of fixing and removing from the cover columns several times with simple tools.<br>
Here the fittings 8 are not directly fixed on the cover columns 7. The fittings 8 are fixed on bases 11. One base 11 and one fitting 8 forms a rigid shaped assembly unit, which can be easily and accurately positioned on a cover column 7.<br><br>
The figures 3 a and b show different design examples of such bases 11, which are preferably formed of sheet metal parts or thin metal profiles. In any case the base 11 has a rigid form, so that it provides a secure hold for the flexible fitting 8.<br>
The design example represented in Fig.3 a shows a base 11, whose top side has a surface similar to that of fitting 8. Here the base 11 has an even surface, on which the fitting 8 rests.<br>
The base 11 represented in Fig.3 b has analogue to design example as per Fig.3a an even surface, on which the fitting 8 rests. Further, the base 11 has edge bars 12 on both of its lengthwise edges, which project from the topside and fix the fitting 8 sideways. Here the height of edge bars 12 is matched with the installation height of fitting 8. The edge bars 12 are formed preferably as a single piece with the main body of the base 11.<br>
The fitting 8 is fixed on the base 11, wherein fitting 8 is screwed or firmly sticked to base 11.<br>
The assembly unit - formed in this manner along with fitting 8 fixed on base 11 -is fixed with the respective cover column 7.<br>
In principal the fixing can be done either by screwing or sticking of base 11 on the topside of the cover column 7.<br>
Figure 4 shows fixing media for fixing of fitting 8 with the base 11 to a cove column 7, which facilitate an especially easy, time saving and economical assembly.<br><br>
As can be seen from Fig.4 the cover column 7 has at its top end a cross seqtion widening in the form of a profile with rectangular cross section, to which joins the rear narrow end of the cover column 7.<br>
The cover column 7 has two shoulders, which form the lower end of the profile. To these shoulders join to even, vertically ruiming side walls, to which the even topside of the cover column 7 joir\s.<br>
For mounting of fitting 8 the same is placed along with the base 11 on the topside of the cover column 7, wherein the side walls of the base 11 are flush with side walls of the profile of the cover column 7.<br>
For fixing of cover column 7 sideways on the profiles the clips 13 forming the fixing media are locked. The clips 13 are made up of sheet metal parts or equivalent and have contact surface, which is in contact with side walls of the profile of the cover column 7 and the base 11 located on it. On the topside and bottom side of each clip 13 a projection 14 protrudes from the contact surface. The projection 14 at the top side of clip 13 is in contact with the topside of the base 11, whereas the projection 14 at the bottom side of the clip 13 is in contact with the offset of the profile of the cover column 11, so that the clips 13 secure the fitting 8 with the base 11 against loosing from the cover column. The clips 13 can be locked and removed preferably without tools on the base 11 and cover column 7, without causing damage to clips 13.<br>
In a preferred design form the clips 13 are designed as rail shaped elements, wherein each clip 13 covers the entire length of the cover column 7.<br>
Alternatively several single clips 13 lying behind each other can be arranged along the cover column 7.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows another design example of fixing media for fixing of base 11 with fitting 8 at the cover column 7. In this case the fixing media consist of a guide in the cover column 7, wherein the guide is designed as dovetail guide. The guide covers in the lengthwise direction of the cover column 7. the dovetail guide is formed as a single piece along with cover column 7 and consists of two guide rails 15, which merge on the lengthwise edge at the top upper side of the cover column 7.<br>
The heights of this guide rails 15 are matched at the installation height of the base 11 with the fitting 8 fixed on it.<br>
Further, the gaps of guide rails 15 at the width of the base 11 are matched with the fitting 8 fixed on it, so that the base 11 with the fitting 8 rests close at the inner side of the guide rails 15.<br>
The basell with the fitting 8 is inserted at the front or the rear end of the cover column in the opening of the hide, until the base 11 rests with its entire length on the topside of the cover column 7.<br>
For fixing of base 11 at the cover column 7 there can be tap holes provided [not shown here] in the side walls of the guide rails 15 and in the base 11. In these tap holes screws are inserted for fixing of base 11 at the guide rails 15.<br>
Alternatively or additionally base 11 [suspended in the guide] can be fixed with fitting 8 that the merging of guides at the front and rear ends are closed with a closure not shown here. Here it is necessary that the length of the base 11 matches exactly with the length of the cover column 7, so that the base 11 lies closely between closures at the front and the rear ends.<br><br>
As closures, for example, plates can be provided, which can be screwed on the front and rear front sides of the cover column 7. Alternatively as closures closing caps or equivalent can be planned, which are fixed by locking at the cover column 7.<br>
In deviation from the design example as per Fig.5 the guides and the basic bodies of cover columns 7 can be designed as multi piece.<br>
For example the basic body of cover column 7 can have an even topside on which the base 11 lies along with fitting 8. The base 11 covers again the entire length of cover column 7. However, the width of the topside of the cover column 7 is larger than the width of the bases 11. In the edge strip projecting over the fitting 8 fixing holes are provided.<br>
For fixing of base 11 on this edge strip guide raillS is mounted, which are fixed on the basic body of the cover column 7 by screws catching in the fixing holes.<br><br>
