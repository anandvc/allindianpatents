				<td>The object of the invention is an arrangement for supporting the stator of an electrical<br>
machine.<br>
The fundamental wave of magnetic flux creates a rotating force field in the air gap of<br>
an electrical machine, between the rotor and the stator. The spatial wavelength of this<br>
harmonic force field is 360/2p degrees, in which p is the number of pairs of poles.<br>
The rotating force wave is a required part of electrical machine operation and cannot<br>
be substantially reduced. On the other hand, the amplitude of the force wave is so<br>
great that even a thick stator back tends to deform. This happens in spite of the fact<br>
that the elastic properties of the stator pack in a plane perpendicular to the shaft are<br>
close to the corresponding values for steel. On the other hand, the deformations of the<br>
stator have a quasi-static nature because the frequency of the characteristic form<br>
corresponding to the force wave, for example 400 Hz, is clearly higher than the<br>
excitation frequency, for example 100 Hz. The excitation frequency is the supply<br>
frequency multiplied by two.<br>
The frame structure of large electrical machines is usually box-shaped. The frame<br>
structure is usually relatively symmetric in relation to the vertical plane containing the<br>
axial line and the sectional plane perpendicular to the axial line going through the<br>
centre point. However, the motor is usually asymmetric in relation to the horizontal<br>
plane containing the axial line. In such a structure the rotating deformation wave<br>
present in the stator creates vibration in the frame structure due to the asymmetry of<br>
the structure and support. These deformations are manifested as bearing vibration, for<br>
example.<br>
The stator usually comprises thin plates that are attached together using back beams<br>
and welding, for example. The outermost part of the stator forms the stator back, and<br>
there are grooves in the internal part of the stator in which the windings are placed.<br>
Stator deformation can be reduced by making the stator back thicker or by using<br>
external reinforcements to stiffen the stator. However, this will increase the number<br>
of stages of manufacture, the manufacturing costs, the weight of the machine and its<br>
space requirement.<br><br>
Another method of solving the problem is isolating the stator from the frame. The<br>
objective of isolation is to reduce the transmission of stator deformations to the frame<br>
and the subsequent emergence of bearing vibration. A common method for the<br>
construction of machines is to suspend the source of vibration in a flexible manner. In<br>
the case of a stator, this is impeded by the fact that the stator support must be able to<br>
bear quasi-static and dynamic loads in various situations. Such loads include<br>
gravitational force, nominal torque and short circuit torque. Furthermore, the stator<br>
pack and its suspension have a substantial effect on the characteristic frequencies and<br>
vibration behaviour of the entire motor.<br>
The vibration problem at the second multiple of the supply frequency is particularly<br>
substantial in large two-pole asynchronous machines. Higher numbers of poles<br>
shorten the spatial wavelength of the force field, which reduces the deformations of<br>
the stator.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to create an arrangement for reducing frame<br>
and bearing vibrations in an electrical machine in a manner that is advantageous in<br>
terms of manufacturing technique. In order to achieve this, the invention and some<br>
other preferred embodiments of the invention have the characteristics described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
According to the invention, the stator is supported and fastened at the ends of the<br>
stator pack. Support is implemented by means of in the circumferential direction<br>
narrow necks of material on the outer circumference of the stator having the smallest<br>
possible circumferential width. The length of necks to the axial direction of the stator<br>
is short in comparison to the length of the stator in the axial direction. The number of<br>
the necks at the end of the stator pack is even. The stator has a vertical symmetry axis<br>
perpendicular to the axial direction and a horizontal symmetry axis perpendicular to<br>
the axial direction. The necks of material are located symmetrically to at least one of<br>
the symmetry axes, or the necks may be located symmetrically to both symmetry axes.<br>
In a preferred solution the necks are located close to the vertical axis perpendicular to<br>
the axial direction and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial direction. The<br>
support isolates the stator from the frame by utilising the natural properties of the<br><br>
frame structure. Furthermore, the support eliminates the transmission of the rotating<br>
stator deformation wave into horizontal vibration of the frame.<br>
A particularly preferred solution includes four necks of material at the end of the<br>
stator pack, with the necks located on the vertical axis perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction and on the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial direction.<br>
The intention does not aim to prevent elliptical movement caused by the force field.<br>
In the solution according to the invention, only a small amount of vibration energy is<br>
transmitted from the stator to the frame of the machine due to a symmetric and<br>
flexible attachment.<br>
The solution according to the invention substantially reduces the frame and bearing<br>
vibrations caused by the fundamental flux of electrical machines. The invention<br>
particularly improves the management of second-order vibrations in large two-pole<br>
electrical machines. The invention can also be used to reduce higher-frequency<br>
impulses originating in the stator from being transmitted to the frame and becoming<br>
audible. The solution according to the invention is not limited to two-pole machines;<br>
it is also suitable for asynchronous or synchronous machines with more poles.<br>
A support arrangement with four necks of material is preferred in terms of<br>
manufacturing technique. A particularly preferred solution can be achieved by<br>
implementing an attachment of four necks of material between the stator end plate and<br>
the intermediate wall. Either of the surfaces, which have originally been machined to<br>
a round shape, can be made thinner between the necks. The required reduction in<br>
thickness is small, for example 0.1 to 2 mm. This does not have any substantial effect<br>
on structural rigidity. In particular, rigidity in the cross direction of the intermediate<br>
walls remains unchanged. Furthermore, the narrow slot does not cause any substantial<br>
through flow of cooling air that would require the slot to be blocked. In a solution<br>
according to the invention, positioning the stator is simple as the attachment surfaces<br>
are concentric. The circumferential width and the length in axial direction of the neck<br>
are determined from the ultimate load transmitted from the stator to the frame of<br>
electrical machine. A suitable circumferential width of the neck seen from the centre<br>
of the stator to the circumference is 4°...20°, preferably 5°...10°. In an embodiment,<br><br>
where the necks are formed on an intermediate wall, it is preferred in terms of<br>
manufacturing technique to dimension of the length of the neck to axial direction<br>
equal to the thickness of the intermediate wall. In an embodiment, where the necks are<br>
elements attached to an intermediate wall or an end plate, it is efficient to dimension<br>
the necks to be longer than the thickness of the intermediate wall; the length of a neck<br>
is 1...6 times the thickness of the intermediate wall or and-plate, for instance.<br>
The structure presented in the invention is preferable in terms of quasi-static loads.<br>
When the necks of material are located close to the vertical axis perpendicular to the<br>
axial direction and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial direction, they are<br>
also close to the side walls, bottom plate and top plate of the frame. As a consequence<br>
of this, the support of the attachment points is rigid at the planes of these plates.<br>
When the stator is supported at both ends with four narrow necks of material, it can be<br>
generalised that the stator is supported at eight axially rigid points and four vertically<br>
and horizontally rigid points. All of the eight attachment points are inherently flexible<br>
in the radial direction. If necessary, the attachment can be further improved locally by<br>
reinforcing the inherently rigid directions of the support points specified above.<br>
Rigidity in the radial direction can also be reduced. A particularly preferred solution<br>
in the radial direction is a radially flexible support to a frame that is as rigid as<br>
possible in the radial direction.<br>
When the solution according to the invention is implemented by two necks of material<br>
at the end of the stator pack, it is preferable to locate the necks at the intersection<br>
points of the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial direction, the outer surface of<br>
the stator and the ends of the stator. In this case the necks are located symmetrically<br>
in relation to the vertical symmetry axis perpendicular to the axial direction.<br>
In a solution implemented with six necks of material, it is preferable to locate two<br>
necks either at the intersection points of the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction, the outer surface of the stator and the ends of the stator, or at the intersection<br>
points of the vertical axis perpendicular to the axial direction, the outer surface of the<br>
stator and the ends of the stator. The remaining four necks are located at the<br>
intersection points of the outer surface of the stator and the ends of the stator so that<br>
all six necks are symmetrical to each other.<br><br>
In a solution with eight necks it is most preferable to locate four necks at the<br>
intersection points of the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axial direction, the outer<br>
surface of the stator and the ends of the stator so that the necks are located close to<br>
each other at both sides of the intersection points. The remaining four necks are<br>
located at the intersection points of the vertical axis perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction, the outer surface of the stator and the ends of the stator so that the necks are<br>
located close to each other at both sides of the intersection points. In this case the<br>
necks are located symmetrically in relation to the vertical symmetry axis<br>
perpendicular to the axial direction and the horizontal symmetry axis perpendicular to<br>
the axial direction.<br>
The structure presented in the invention receives the load imposed by torque on the<br>
stator by means of the necks and transfers the load to the base through the top plate,<br>
side walls, bottom plate and the frame mounts.<br>
In the following the invention will be described in more detail with the help of certain<br>
embodiments by referring to the enclosed drawings.<br>

The frame structure 1 of an electrical machine and the applicable coordinate system<br>
(xyz) are illustrated in Figure 1. The frame is assumed to be a box. The frame<br>
structure is relatively symmetric in relation to the vertical plane containing the axial<br>
line 2 (the yz plane), as well as the sectional plane perpendicular to the axial line 2<br><br>
containing the centre point (the xy plane). The motor and its support are asymmetric<br>
in relation to the horizontal plane containing the axial line 2 (the xz plane).<br>
In a two-pole electrical machine a force field deforms the stator and makes it<br>
elliptical. Figure 2 illustrates deformations imposed by a rotating elliptical wave on<br>
the frame 1 according to prior art. Simply said, the rotating stator deformation ellipse<br>
bends the frame 1 into a diamond shape and causes horizontal net movement of the<br>
centre of gravity.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates frame deformations with a support according to the invention. The<br>
number of necks 40a-d is four. The intention does not aim to prevent elliptical<br>
deformation of the stator pack caused by the force field. In a solution according to the<br>
invention, only a small amount of vibration energy is transmitted from the stator to the<br>
frame 1 of the machine due to a symmetric and flexible attachment. This means that<br>
the rotating deformation wave is not transmitted into horizontal vibration of the frame<br>
1.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 emphasise the frame deformations caused by the force field.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 4. In Figure 4 the stator 10 is<br>
located inside the frame 1 of the machine. The stator 10 is supported at both ends 12<br>
of the stator at the locations of the thrust rings 30 and intermediate walls 20 using<br>
narrow necks of material 21a, 21c, 21 e, 21f (the remaining four necks are not visible<br>
in the illustration). The intermediate walls 20 are supported on the frame 1. The<br>
concentrically machined necks position the stator 10 radially in relation to the frame 1.<br>
The necks 21a, 21c, 21e, 21f are apart of the intermediate wall 20. Controlled contact<br>
between the stator 10 and the intermediate walls 20 of the frame can be created by a<br>
crimp or shrink fit, for example.<br>
The embodiment presented in Figure 5 the square intermediate wall 20 has a round<br>
opening 24 in the middle, with four necks 21a, 21b, 21c, 21d supporting the stator on<br>
the inner surface of the opening. The necks are of substantially equal size and shape.<br>
The first neck 21a is located at the midpoint of the side 25a of the intermediate wall,<br>
the second neck 21b is at the midpoint of the side 25b, the third neck 21c is at the<br><br>
midpoint of the side 25c and the fourth neck 21d is at the midpoint of the side 25d.<br>
These locations of the necks 21a-d place them close to the side walls 3, bottom plate 4<br>
and top plate 5 of the frame. Thus the support of the necks 21a-d is rigid in the planes<br>
of these plates. The torque is transmitted through the necks 21a-d, the intermediate<br>
wall 20, the top plate 5, the bottom plate 4, the side walls 3 and the frame mounts to<br>
the base 6. The outer surface 11 is marked with a broken line in the drawing.<br>
The side length or protrusion 23 of the neck, for example 0.5 mm, is very small<br>
compared with the diameter L of the opening 24, for example 1000 mm. The width of<br>
the base 22 of the neck, 80 mm, is small compared with the diameter L of the opening<br>
24, for example 1000 mm. The length of the neck in axial direction is the same as the<br>
thickness of the intermediate wall, 20.. .40 mm for instance.<br>
The necks are located symmetrically in relation to the vertical symmetry axis 7<br>
perpendicular to the axial direction. The necks are also located symmetrically in<br>
relation to the horizontal symmetry axis 8 perpendicular to the axial direction.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6 illustrates a<br>
thrust ring that forms the end plate of the stator. There are four necks of material 31a,<br>
31b, 31c, 31d machined on the thrust ring 30. The necks are of substantially equal<br>
size and shape. The necks 31a-31d are located symmetrically to each other on the<br>
outer circumference 34 of the thrust ring. The necks 31a-31d are located<br>
symmetrically in relation to the vertical symmetry axis 7 perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction. The necks 31a-31d are also located symmetrically in relation to the<br>
horizontal symmetry axis 8 perpendicular to the axial direction.<br>
The side length or protrusion 33 of the neck is very small compared with the diameter<br>
D of the thrust ring. The width of the base 32 of the neck is small compared with the<br>
diameter D of the thrust ring.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 7. In Figure 7 there are<br>
four necks 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d at the stator end 12. The necks 40a-d are of<br>
substantially equal size and shape. The necks 40a-d are wedge-shaped elements<br>
attached to the intermediate wall 20. The necks 40a-d are located at the intersection<br><br>
point of the vertical axis 41 perpendicular to the axial direction 2, the outer surface 11<br>
of the stator and the end 12 of the stator, as well as at the intersection point of the<br>
horizontal axis 42 perpendicular to the axial direction 2, the outer surface 11 of the<br>
stator and the end 12 of the stator.<br>
The dimensions of the necks illustrated in Figures 4 to 7 are not to scale with the rest<br>
of the illustrations but are emphasised for the sake of clarity.<br>
