Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found that a class of isoflavan derivatives of the general<br>
formula (I) show surprising and unexpected biological and pharmaceutical properties.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the invention are believed to have favourable toxicity<br>
profiles with normal cells and good bioavailability. Surprisingly the compounds of the<br>
invention-exhibit anti-cancer activity, significantly.better than or at least comparable to<br>
known cancer treatments.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are cytostatic and cytotoxic against a broad range of cancer<br>
cells of human and animal origin. By cancer cells, it is meant cells that display malignant<br>
characteristics and which are distinguished from non-cancer cells by unregulated growth<br>
and behaviour which usually ultimately is life-threatening unless successfully treated.<br>
The cancer cells that have been found to be responsive to compounds of formula (I) are of<br>
epithelial origin (for example, prostate, ovarian, cervical, breast, gall-bladder, pancreatic,<br>
colorectal, renal, and non-small lung cancer cells), of mesenchymal origin (for example,<br>
melanoma, mesothelioma and sarcoma cancer cells), and of neural origin (for example<br>
glioma cancer cells). It is highly unusual and surprising to find a related group of<br>
compounds that display such potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells, but with low toxicity<br>
against non-cancer cells such as keratinocytes derived from human foreskin. Such cancer<br>
cell selectivity is highly unusual and unexpected.<br>
Advantageously the compounds of formula (I) show cytotoxicity against cancer cells that<br>
are well recognised for being poorly sensitive to standard anti-cancer drugs. It is highly<br>
unusual and unexpected to find such potent activity against cancers, for example,<br>
cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and melanoma.<br>
Advantageously the compounds of formula (I) also unexpectedly display an ability to<br>
radio-sensitise cancer cells, by which it is meant that these compounds either lower the<br>
amount of gamma-irradiation that is required to kill the cells, or they convert cancer cells<br>
from a state of radio-resistance to a radio-sensitive state.<br>
Additionally the compounds of formula (I) are thought to possess chemo-sensitising<br>
activity, that is they increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, especially to<br>
cancer cells, and/or convert cancerous cells from a state of chemo-resistance to a chemosensitive<br>
state.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also provide chemo and/or radio-protective properties for<br>
non-cancerous cells. This has significant therapeutic implications because the traumatic<br>
side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are caused by the toxicity of the traditional<br>
treatments to non-cancerous cells.<br>
The properties described above offer significant clinical advantages.<br>
The radio and/or chemo-protective properties of the compounds of the invention may be<br>
employed to protect healthly individuals from the effects of radiation and/or chemical<br>
toxins, or lessen the effects of the same.<br>
Thus, the invention also provides the use of compounds of formula (I) to treat patients with<br>
cancer by either reducing the rate of growth of such rumours or by reducing the size of<br>
such tumours through therapy with said compounds alone, and/or in combination with each<br>
other, and/or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, and/or in combination with<br>
radiotherapy.<br>
The use of compounds of the present invention either alone or in combination therapy as<br>
described above may reduce the adverse side-effects often experienced by patients when<br>
treated with standard anti-cancer treatments. The use of compounds of the invention may<br>
mean that lower doses can be employed in such therapy which represents an important<br>
advance for cancer sufferers.<br>

di-(C1-C4-alkyl)-amino-carbonyl, hydroxyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, formyloxy, C1-C4-<br>
alkyl-carbonyloxy, C1-C4-alkylthio, C3-C6-cycloalkyl or phenyl.<br>
Preferably the alkyl group does not bear any substituents.<br>
The term "aryl" is taken to include phenyl, benzyl, biphenyl and naphthyl and may be<br>
optionally substituted by one or more C1-C4-alkyl, hydroxy, C1-C4-alkoxys carbonyl, Cj-<br>
C4-alkoxycarbonyl, C1-C4-alkylcarbonyloxy, nitro or halo.<br>
The term "halo" is taken to include fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo, preferably fluoro and<br>
chloro, more preferably fluoro. Reference to for example "haloalkyl" will include<br>
monohalogenated, dihalogenated and up to perhalogenated alkyl groups. Preferred<br>
haloalkyl groups are trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl.<br>
The compounds of the invention include all salts, such as acid addition salts, anionic salts<br>
and zwitterionic salts, and in particular include pharmaceutically acceptable salts as would<br>
be known to those skilled in the art. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to<br>
an organic or inorganic moiety that carries a charge and that can be administered in<br>
association with a pharmaceutical agent, for example, as a counter-cation or counter-anion<br>
in a salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable cations are known to those of skilled in the art, and<br>
include but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc and quaternary amine.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable anions are known to those of skill in the art, and include but<br>
are not limited to chloride, acetate, tosylate, citrate, bicarbonate and carbonate.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed from: acetic, ascorbic, aspartic,<br>
benzoic, benzenesulphonic, citric, cinnamic, ethanesulphonic, fumaric, glutamic, glutaric,<br>
gluconic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, lactic, maleic, malic, methanesulphonic, naphthoic,<br>
hydroxynaphthoic, naphthalenesulphonic, naphthalenedisulphonic, naphthaleneacrylic,<br>
oleic, oxalic, oxaloacetic, phosphoric, pyruvic, P-toluenesulphonic, tartaric, trifluoroacetic,<br>
triphenylacetic, tricarballylic, salicylic, sulphuric, sulphamic, sulphanilic and succinic<br>
acid.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" or "prodrug" refers to a derivative of<br>
the active compound that upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing<br>
directly or indirectly, the parent compound or metabolite, or that exhibits activity itself<br>
and includes for- example phosphate derivatives and sulphonate derivatives. Thus,<br>
derivatives include solvates, pharmaceutically active esters, prodrugs or the like. This also<br>
includes derivatives with physiologically cleavable leaving groups that can be cleaved in<br>
vivo to provide the compounds of the invention or their active moiety. The leaving groups<br>
may include acyl, phosphate, sulfate, sulfonate, and preferably are mono-, di- and per-acyl<br>
oxy-substituted compounds, where one or more of the pendant hydroxy groups are<br>
protected by an acyl group, preferably an acetyl group. Typically acyloxy substituted<br>
compounds of the invention are readily cleavable to the corresponding hydroxy substituted<br>
compounds.<br>
Chemical functional group protection, deprotection, synthons and other techniques known<br>
to those skilled in the art may be used where appropriate to aid in the synthesis of the<br>
compounds of the present invention, and their starting materials.<br>
The protection of functional groups on the compounds and derivatives of the present<br>
invention can be carried out by well established methods in the art, for example as<br>
described in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
New York, 1981.<br>
Hydroxyl protecting groups include but are not limited to carboxylic acid esters, eg acetate<br>
esters, aryl esters such as benzoate, acetals/ketals such as acetonide and benzylidene, ethers<br>
such as o-benzyl and/?-methoxy ben2yl ether, tetrahydropyranyl ether and silyl ethers such<br>
as 7-butyldimethyl silyl ether.<br>
Protecting groups can be removed by, for example, acid or base catalysed hydrolysis or<br>
reduction, for example, hydrogenation. Silyl ethers may require hydrogen fluoride or<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride to be cleaved.<br>
It will be clear to persons skilled in the art of medicinal chemistry that compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be converted into other compounds of formula (I), for example, where a<br>
compound of formula (I) bears one or more hydroxyl substituents then one or more of<br>
these substituents can be converted in to a halo substituent such as bromo, chloro or iodo<br>
by treating the alcohol with a halogenating agent. Halogenating agents include compounds<br>
like NBS, hydrobromic acid, chlorine gas etc. It may be necessary during processes such<br>
as halogenation to use protecting groups to protect other functionality in the molecule.<br>
Phenolic type hydroxyls may not be readily convertible to the corresponding halogen<br>
compound by treatment with a halogenating agent. However, the desired halogen<br>
compound may be prepared by, for example, treating an appropriate aryl amine starting<br>
material with NaNO2 in the presence of HCI under reduced temperature conditions such as<br>
15 0°C, to form the corresponding azide salt. Subsequent treatment with CuCl, CuBr, KI or<br>
HBF4 may be used to convert the azide into the required halo-compound.<br>
A general process for preparing compounds of formula (I) comprises the step of treating a<br>
compound of formula (IV):<br>
wherein R1 R2, R3 and W are as defined above in relation to compounds of formula <br>
with a reducing agent to provide a compounds of formula (I) or a protected derivative<br>
thereof.<br>
Reducing agents are well known to persons skilled in the art and can include hydride<br>
sources like borohydrides and alkali metal borohydrides, but would include hydrogen in<br>
catalytic hydrogenation where a suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon may be used.<br>
Other suitable hydride sources include sodium triacetoxyborohydride tetrabutyl ammonium<br>
triacetoxyborohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
Preferably the double bond in compounds of formula (IV) is reduced by hydrogenation.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) are prepared by dehydrating a compound of formula (III):<br>
wherein R1, R2 R3 and W are as defined above, in relation to compounds of formula (II) or<br>
a protected derivative thereof.<br>
Dehydration can, for example, be catalysed by acid, by base or facilitated by conversion of<br>
the tertiary alcohol into a better leaving group as would be known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
Preferably compounds of formula (III) are dehydrated, for example, by treatment with<br>
para-toluene sulphonic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by treating compounds of formula (II):<br>
(II)<br>
O<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 are as defined above for compounds of formula (II) or a protected<br>
derivative thereof with an arylating agent, for example, a compound of formula WM*<br>
wherein W is an optionally substituted aryl radical and M* is one ore more counter ions,<br>
preferably [MgBr]"1".<br>
The arylating agent W"M+ may be prepared by Grignard chemistry where the haloaryl<br>
compound (V):<br>
or a protected derivative thereof wherein<br>
R4, R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen, alkoxy, alkyl, acyl, OC(0)R7, a protected<br>
hydroxy such as OSi(R1o)3 or protected amino such as trimethylsilylamino phenyl<br>
halide, and<br>
RIO is independently alkyl or aryl, and<br>
X is halo, preferably bromo,<br>
is reacted with a metal such as magnesium to form the arylating agent.<br>
Preferably the haloaryl compound (V) is selected from:<br>
(VA)<br>
wherein R4, R5, R6 and X are as defined above for compounds of formula (V).<br>
Reaction of the arylating agent with the ketone of formula (II) provides access to the<br>
corresponding isoflavan-4-ols (III), isoflav-3-enes (IV) and isoflavans (I) of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by reacting compounds of<br>
formula (II) with a compound analogous to compounds of formula (V) wherein X<br>
represents any appropriate leaving group L which is lost in the formation of the product by<br>
nucleophilic addition of the aryl moiety to a ketone by reactions well known by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Preferably any free alcohols, esters or other such reactive groups in the keto compounds of<br>
formula (II) will be protected, for example, as f-butyldimethylsilyl ethers during the<br>
nucleophilic addition reaction.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) can be prepared by reducing the eneone double bond in<br>
compounds of formula (VI):<br>
(Figure Removed)or a protected derivative thereof, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, for<br>
compounds of formula (II).<br>
Suitable reducing agents are described above. Preferably reduction of the carbon-carbon<br>
double bond can be effected, for example, by hydrogenation.<br>
Access to compounds of general formula (VI) is available by general synthetic methods as<br>
set out in Scheme 1 below and as described in published International application No.<br>
WO01/17986, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A typical<br>
synthesis is depicted in Scheme 1.<br>
(Figure Removed)Scheme 1<br>
Access to the variatious 3-phenyl substituted chromans is available by varying the<br>
substitution pattern on the phenylacetic acid derived group.<br>
Access to the 4-phenyl substituted chromans is available by varying the substitution pattern<br>
of the arylating agent (V).<br>
Analogues of compounds employed in the processes may be used which include a<br>
substituent which corresponds to R9 as defined for compounds of formula (I).<br>
As used herein, the terms "treatment", "prophylaxis" or "prevention", "amelioration" and<br>
the like are to be considered in their broadest context. In particular, the term "treatment"<br>
does not necessarily imply that an animal is treated until total recovery. Accordingly,<br>
"treatment" includes amelioration of the symptoms or severity of a particular condition or<br>
preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of developing a particular condition.<br>
The amount of one or more compounds of formula (I) which is required in a therapeutic<br>
treatment according to the invention will depend upon a number of factors, which include<br>
the specific application, the nature of the particular compound used, the condition being<br>
treated, the mode of administration and the condition of the patient.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered in a manner and amount as is<br>
conventionally practised. See, for example, Goodman and Oilman, "The pharmacological<br>
basis of therapeutics", 7th Edition, (1985). The specific dosage utilised will depend upon<br>
the condition being treated, the state of the subject, the route of administration and other<br>
well known factors as indicated above. In general, a daily dose per patient may be in the<br>
range of 0.1 mg to 5 g; typically from 0.5 mg to 1 g; preferably from 50 mg to 200 mg.<br>
The length-of dosing may- range from a single dose given once every day or two, to twice<br>
or thrice daily doses given over the course of from a week to many months to many years<br>
as required, depending on the severity of the condition to be treated or alleviated.<br>
It will be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens<br>
should be adjust over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment<br>
of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions.<br>
15 Relatively short-term treatments with the active compounds can be used to cause<br>
stabilisation or shrinkage or remission of cancers. Longer-term treatments can be<br>
employed to prevent the development of cancers in high-risk patients.<br>
The production of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of the therapeutic<br>
indications herein described are typically prepared by admixture of the compounds of the<br>
invention (for convenience hereafter referred to as the "active compounds") with one or<br>
more pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable carriers and/or excipients as are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other<br>
ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the subject. The carrier or<br>
excipient may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the<br>
compound as a unit-dose, for example, a tablet, which may contain up to 100% by weight<br>
of the active compound, preferably from 0.5% to 59% by weight of the active compound.<br>
One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention,<br>
which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting<br>
essentially of admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory<br>
ingredients. The preferred concentration of active compound in the drug composition will<br>
depend on absorption, distribution, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as<br>
other factors known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, ocular, buccal (for<br>
example, sublingual), parenteral (for example, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or<br>
intravenous), transdermal administration including mucosal administration via the nose,<br>
mouth, vagina or rectum, and as inhalants, although the most suitable route in any given<br>
case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature<br>
of the particular active compound which is being used.<br>
Formulation suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as<br>
capsules, sachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the<br>
active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into<br>
association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more<br>
accessory ingredients as noted above).<br>
In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately<br>
admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and<br>
then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture such as to form a unit dosage. For<br>
example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or moulding a powder or granules<br>
containing the active compound, optionally with one or more other ingredients.<br>
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound<br>
of the free-flowing, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant,<br>
inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Moulded tablets may be made by<br>
moulding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid<br>
binder.<br>
Formulations suitable for buccal (sublingual) administration include lozenges comprising<br>
the active compound in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and<br>
pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatine and glycerin or sucrose<br>
and acacia.<br>
Formulations suitable for ocular administration include liquids, gels and creams<br>
comprising the active compound in an ocularly acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration conveniently<br>
comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the active compounds, which preparations are<br>
preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are<br>
preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also be effected by<br>
means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such preparations may<br>
conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water or a glycine buffer and<br>
rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable formulations<br>
according to the invention generally contain from 0.1% to 60% w/v of active compound<br>
and can be administered at a rate of 0.1 ml/minute/kg.<br>
Formulations for infusion, for example, may be prepared employing saline as the carrier<br>
and a solubilising agent such as a cyclodextrin or derivative thereof. Suitable<br>
cyclodextrins include ct-cyclodextrin, p-cyclodextrin, y-cyclodextrin, dimethyl-pcyclodextrin,<br>
2-hydroxyethyl-β-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, 3-<br>
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and tri-methyl-β-cyclodextrin. More preferably the<br>
cyclodextrin is hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. Suitable derivatives of cyclodextrins<br>
include Captisol® a sulfobutyl ether derivative of cyclodextrin and analogues thereof as<br>
described in US 5,134,127.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose<br>
suppositories. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration are preferably presented as<br>
unit dose pessaries. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or<br>
more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting<br>
mixture.<br>
Formulations or compositions suitable for topical administration to the skin preferably take<br>
the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which<br>
may be used include Vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, and combination<br>
of two or more thereof. The active compound is generally present at a concentration of<br>
from 0.1% to 5% w/w, more particularly from 0.5% to 2% w/w. Examples of such<br>
compositions include cosmetic skin creams.<br>
Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches<br>
adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged<br>
period of time. Such patches suitably contain the active compound as an optionally<br>
buffered aqueous solution of, for example, 0.1 M to 0,2 M concentration with respect to<br>
the said active compound. See for example Brown, L., et al, (1998).<br>
Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by<br>
15 iontophoresis (see, for example, Panchagnula R, et al., 2000) and typically take the form of<br>
an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations<br>
comprise citrate or Bis/Tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 M to 0.2<br>
M active ingredient.<br>
Formulations suitable for inhalation may be delivered as a spray composition in the form<br>
of a solution, suspension or emulsion. The inhalation spray composition may further<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable propellant such as carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide<br>
or a hydrogen containing fluorocarbon such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-<br>
heptafluoro-n-propane or mixtures thereof.<br>
The active compounds may be provided in the form of food stuffs, such as being added to,<br>
admixed into, coated, combined or otherwise added to a food stuff. The term food stuff is<br>
used in its widest possible sense and includes liquid formulations such as drinks including<br>
dairy products and other foods, such as health bars, desserts, etc. Food formulations<br>
containing compounds of the invention can be readily prepared according to standard<br>
practices.<br>
Therapeutic methods, uses and compositions may be for administration to humans or other<br>
animals, including mammals such as companion and domestic animals (such as dogs and<br>
cats) and livestock animals (such as cattle, sheep, pigs and goats), birds (such as chickens,<br>
turkeys, ducks), marine animals including those in the aquaculture setting (such as fish,<br>
crustaceans and shell fish) and the like.<br>
-The active compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives prpdrugs or salts thereof<br>
can also be co-administered with other active materials that do not impair the desired<br>
action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antibiotics,<br>
antifungals, antiinflammatories, or antiviral compounds. The active agent can comprise<br>
two or more isoflavones or derivatives thereof in combination or synergistic mixture. The<br>
active compounds can also be administered with lipid lowering agents such as probucol<br>
and nicotinic acid; platelet aggregation inhibitors such as aspirin; antithrombotic agents<br>
such as coumadin; calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine;<br>
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril, and Pblockers<br>
such as propanolol, terbutalol, and labetalol. The compounds can also be<br>
administered in combination with nonsteriodal antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen,<br>
indomethacin, aspirin, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid and sulindac. The<br>
compounds can also be administered with corticosteroids or an anti-emetic such as<br>
zofran®.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) seem to be particularly suitable for co-administration with one<br>
or more anti-cancer drugs such as cisplatin, dehydroequol (DHE), taxol (paclitaxel),<br>
gemcitabine, doxorubicin, topotecan and/or camptothecin, especially cisplatin,<br>
dehydroequol (DHE), taxol. This may result in improved effects in the treatment, for<br>
example in the form of synergistic effects, in comparison to when only one of the<br>
medicaments is employed. Particularly the compounds of the presently claimed invention,<br>
especially HMC (ie compound 1) seem to be chemosensitisers and increase the<br>
cytotoxicity of the one or more anticancer drug co-administered therewith. This seems to<br>
be the case even though said anticancer drugs work through a variety of different<br>
mechanisms, for example cisplatin is thought to work by interacting with nuclear DNA,<br>
taxol is thought to work by blocking cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and prevent<br>
hem forming normal mitotic apparatus, gemcitabine is thought to work by incorporating<br>
itself into the DNA of the cell, ultimately preventing mitosis, doxorubicin is though to be a<br>
topoisomerase II inhibitor thereby preventing DNA replication and transcription and<br>
topotecan is thought to be a topoisomerase I inhibitor.<br>
Interestingly, in some situations this increased cytotoxicity to cancerous cells is not<br>
associated with a corresponding increase in toxicity to non-cancerous cells.<br>
Whilst this observation has important implications for the treatment of many cancers, it is<br>
especially important to the treatment of cancers such as melanoma, which are extremely<br>
difficult to treat.<br>
The co-administration may be simultaneous or sequential. Simultaneous administration<br>
may be effected by the compounds being in the same unit dose, or in individual and<br>
discrete unit doses administered at the same or similar time. Sequential administration<br>
may be in any order as required and typically will require an ongoing physiological effect<br>
of the first or initial active agent to be current when the second or later active agent is<br>
administered, especially where a cumulative or synergistic effect is desired.<br>
The invention also extends to a pack comprising the combination therapy.<br>
Compounds for use in the preferred synthetic methods of the present invention may be<br>
derived from any number of sources readily identifiable to a person skilled in the art. For<br>
example, daidzein is readily available or can be synthesised by standard methods known in<br>
the art. Suitable methods may be found in, for example, published international patent<br>
applications WO 98/08503 and WO 00/49009, and references cited therein, which are<br>
incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
Compounds of the general formulae (II), (III) and (IV) described above are intermediates<br>
in the production of the active isoflavan compounds of formula (I). These intermediates<br>
also represent further aspects of the present invention.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory the compounds of the present invention are<br>
thought to regulate a wide variety of signal transduction processes within animal cells and<br>
that these signal transduction processes are involved in a wide range of functions that are<br>
vital to the survival and function of all animal cells. Therefore, these compounds have<br>
broad-ranging and important health benefits in animals including humans, and in particular<br>
have the potential to prevent and treat important and common human diseases, disorders<br>
and functions, which represents .a substantial unexpected benefit.<br>
Thus it seems that the compounds of the present invention have activity as TNFoc<br>
inhibitors. It Is hypothesised that TNFa is part of a tightly regulated cytokine network,<br>
activating multiple signal transduction pathways and inducing or suppressing a wide<br>
variety of genes. TNFa can provide a survival signal for cancer cells and hence it has been<br>
referred to as a tumour promoting factor. As a central mediator of inflammation, TNFa<br>
provides a molecular link between chronic inflammatory stimuli and the subsequent<br>
15 development of malignant disease. Consequently its inhibition by the compounds of the<br>
invention may provide one mechanism by which they exert anti-cancer and/or antiinflammatory<br>
activity. Alternatively, these compounds may be used as chemopreventative<br>
agents.<br>
The particular benefits of this invention lie in (a) the large range of signal transduction<br>
processes targeted by the compounds, (b) the fact that regulation of these various processes<br>
includes both up-regulation of some processes and down-regulation of others, and (c) that<br>
such a broad and varied effect on signal transduction processes also is accompanied by an<br>
independent effect on a range of important enzymes that are fundamental to metabolism<br>
and steroidogenesis.<br>
The isoflavan compounds of the present invention exhibit good in vitro toxicity profiles<br>
against normal cells. The isoflavans have broad activity, markedly better than or at least<br>
comparable with dehydroequol. The isoflavans are highly active against cancer cells<br>
representative of leukaemia, glioma, prostate, ovarian, breast and lung cancer. The<br>
isoflavan compounds show potent activity against melanoma and cholangiocarcinoma<br>
(gall bladder cancer) cell lines. Good activity was observed against colorectal cancer<br>
PCT/AU2005/001436<br>
cells.<br>
Radio-sensitisation in vivo may be tested for example employing human epidermoid vulval<br>
carcinoma A431 tumours established on the upper leg and subjected to several doses of<br>
local radiation (to the tumour bearing leg only). A radiation treatment regimen of<br>
2.5Gy/day for 4 days will delay tumour growth, and the effect of the radiation dose in<br>
combination with the test compound.could be assessed by monitoring tumour growth<br>
delay. Tumour growth delay of ~6 days can be expected using radiation alone. Tumour<br>
growth delay using orally dosed test compound can be determined separately. Evidence of<br>
:est compound mediated radio-sensitisation of A431 tumours is then determined by<br>
measuring tumour growth delay using a regimen of orally dosed test compound pre-treated<br>
animals followed by the standard radiation therapy regimen described above. A mean<br>
growth delay of up to 30 days using the combination treatment compared to up to 10 days<br>
using either radiation or test compound monotherapy regimens is evidence of the radio-<br>
15 sensitisation properties of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Radio-sensitisation in vitro may be tested, for example, employing clonogenic assays using<br>
human the human epidermoid vulva carcinoma A431 cell line to measure response to<br>
radiation alone or in combination with test compounds. A drug dose causing 10% toxicity<br>
to the cells may be used in combination with graded doses of radiation. The appropriate<br>
dose of compound would be determined by clonogenic assay. Evidence of test compound<br>
mediated radio-sensitisation is shown by, for example, a &gt;20% toxicity to cells using<br>
chemoradiation therapy compared to 10% toxicity using the corresponding monotherapy<br>
regimens.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of<br>
diseases associated with aberrant cell survival, aberrant cell proliferation, abnormal cellular<br>
migration, abnormal angiogenesis, abnormal estrogen/androgen balance, dysfunctional or<br>
abnormal steroid genesis, degeneration including degenerative changes within blood vessel<br>
walls, inflammation, and immunological imbalance.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples and<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

1.0. Synthesis<br>
Example 1: 4',7-Diacetoxydaidzein<br>
A<br>
A mixture of daidzein (2.0 g), acetic anhydride (10 ml) and pyridine (2 ml) was heated at<br>
105-110 C for Ih. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, it was stirred for a<br>
further 30 min during which time the diacetate crystallised from solution. The product was<br>
filtered, washed thoroughly with water and recrystallised from methanol to yield 4',7-<br>
diacetoxydaidzein as colourless prisms (2.4 g, 90%).<br>
Example 2: 7-Acetoxy-3-(4-acetoxyphenyl)chroman-4-one<br>
Palladium-on-charcoal (5%, 0.02g) was added to a solution of 4',7-diacetoxydaidzein<br>
(O.50g, 1.5 mmol) in ethyl acetate (80 ml) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
under a hydrogen atmosphere for 72h. The catalyst was removed by filtration through<br>
Celite and the resulting filtrate was evaporated in vacua. The residue was recrystallised<br>
WO 2006/032086 PCT/AU2005/001436<br>
from ethanol to yield 7-acetoxy-3-(4-acetoxyphenyl)chroman-4-one (0.40g, 80%) as<br>
colourless plates.<br>
Example 3: 7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one<br>
Imidazole (0.63g) was added to a suspension of 4',7-diacetoxydihydrodaidzein (0.26g, 0.08<br>

2.0. Materials and Methods<br>
2.1. Tissue culture<br>
The human pancreatic cancer cell line, HP AC (CRL-2119) was routinely cultured in 1:1<br>
mixture DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium Sigma) plus Ham's F12 (Sigma)<br>
medium containing HEPES (15 mM), insulin (0.002 mg/mlX transferrin (0.005 mg/ml),<br>
hydrocortisone, (40 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). The ovarian cancer cell<br>
lines; CP70 was obtained as a gift from Dr. Gil Mor (Yale University) and cultured in a 1:1<br>
mixture DMEM plus Ham's F12 medium, and SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer cell line) was<br>
purchased from ATCC and cultured in McCoys 5a medium. The breast cancer cell line<br>
MDA-MB-468 cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium. The melanoma cell line MM200<br>
was obtained as a gift from Peter Hersey (University of Newcastle) and A2058 was<br>
obtained as a gift from Dr Peter Parsons (QIMR), Both were cultured in DMEM medium.<br>
All cultures were supplemented with 10% PCS (fetal calf serum CSL, Australia), penicillin<br>
(lOOU/ml), streptomycin (lOOmg/ml), L-glutamine (2mM) and sodium bicarbonate (1.2<br>
g/L), and cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% COj. All cell lines were<br>
purchased from ATCC (Maryland, USA) except where noted.<br>
The normal cell line NFF (neonatal foreskin fibroblasls) was a gift from Dr. Peter Parsons<br>
(Queensland Institute of Medical Research). RK (rabbit kidney) cells were obtained from<br>
Miller Whalley (Macquarie University). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI<br>
supplemented with 10% PCS (CSL, Australia), penicillin (lOOU/ml), streptomycin<br>
(lOOmg/ml), L-glutamine (2mM) and sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/L), and cultured at 37°C<br>
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.<br>
2.2. Proliferation assays<br>
IC50 values were determined for each cell line. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at an<br>
appropriate cell density as determined from growth kinetics analysis and cultured for 5<br>
days in the absence and presence of the test compounds. Cell proliferation was assessed<br>
after the addition of 20 μl of 3-4,5 dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide<br>
(MTT, 2.5mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) for 3-4hrs at 37°C according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions. IC50 values were calculated from semi-log plots of % of control proliferation<br>
on the y-axis against log dose on the x-axis.<br>
2.3. DHE and HMC Pharmacokinetics - Oral<br>
HMC and DHE were prepared as homogenous suspensions in 1% CMC (m:v, water). Both<br>
formulations were delivered orally by gavage to female BALB/c mice at a dosage of 50<br>
mg/kg. Three animals were allocated to each timepoint (15 min, 30 min, Ihr, 4 hr and 24<br>
hr). At each respective timepoint, animals were euthanased by cervical dislocation and<br>
blood collected. Free HMC was analysed by mass spectroscopy.<br>
2.4. HMC Pharmacokinetics - i.v. and i.p.<br>
HMC was prepared as a solution in 20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m:v, water).<br>
The formulation was delivered either orally by gavage or by i.p. injection to female<br>
BALB/c mice at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Three animals were allocated to each timepoint (15<br>
min, 30 min, Ihr, 4 hr and 24 hr). At each respective timepoint, animals were euthanased<br>
by cervical .dislocation and blood collected. Urine was also collected and analysed for<br>
HMC. Free HMC was analysed by mass spectroscopy.<br>
2.5 Pilot in vivo efficacy study — HP AC tumour bearing mice<br>
Subconfluent (80%) flasks of HP AC cells were trypsinised, washed in Hanks balanced salt<br>
solution (Sigma), resuspended in dubellco's minimal essential medium (Sigma) and an<br>
equal volume of matrigel™ (Becton Dickson) at a density of 3.7 x 107cells per ml.<br>
Athymic nu/nu BALB/c mice were s.c. inoculated with 3.7xl06 HPAC cells bi-laterally<br>
midway along the dorsal surface. For the HMC (n=3 per dosage regimen) and control<br>
groups (n=2), treatment commenced five days post inoculation to allow tumour formation.<br>
HMC was formulated 20% HPBCD and delivered i.p. daily for 15 days. The control group<br>
received equivalent (weight:weight) i.p. doses of 20% HPBCD. Tumour measurements<br>
commenced on day 5 post inoculation (10x10 mm2) and were measured in 2 dimensions,<br>
length (a) and width (b), using calipers. Tumor weight (W) was calculated by the formula<br>
W=ab2 /2, where a, is the longer of the 2 measurements (Odwyer et al., 1994), Tumour<br>
proliferation curves were analyzed with respect to maximal tumour inhibition<br>
(treated/control, TIC). On sacrifice, liver, kidney, femur, stomach and colon tissue were<br>
fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sections cut and stained with H&amp;E.<br>
Stained sections were then submitted to Rothwell consulting for histopathology analysis.<br>
Serum biochemistry was conducted on bloods taken from control, vehicle control and<br>
HMC treatment groups. Serum analysis was conducted by Veterinary Clinical pathology<br>
(U. Syd).<br>
2.6 Three-D model analysis of synergy<br>
3-D model analysis of the cytotoxic interaction between drug A and drug B enables the<br>
representation of predicted inhibitory effect of two drugs in combination in 3 dimensions<br>
to reveal actual regions of synergy or antagonism. The 3D synergy plots are based on a<br>
theory of "Theretical Additivity" (TA) as outlined by Kanzawa et al (Int. J. Cancer 71,<br>
311-319 (1997)). Theoretical Additivity was calculated from the cytotoxicities of drug A<br>
and drug B as monotherapies using the following formula which assumes the drugs are<br>
mutually exclusive inhibitors:<br>
(fa)ATA(<br>
D =<br>
Where: (fa)A<br>
= fraction of cells affected by drug A<br>
(fa)s - fraction of cells affected by drug B<br>
The TA is calculated for each combination of drug concentrations and subtracted from the<br>
observed experimental effect for each combination to give a measurement of synergistic<br>
action. A positive difference indicates that more cells are affected by the drug combination<br>
than would be expected in theory if the two drugs were administered together - hence<br>
synergism. A negative difference indicates that less cells were affected than theoretically<br>
expected - hence antagonism.<br>
3.0. Results<br>
3.1. Normal cell toxicity<br>
Dehydroequol (DHE) was less toxic to both NFF and rabbit kidney cells with IC50 values<br>
above 150 uM when compared to HMC (86 and 61 uM respectively) (Table 1 and Figure<br>
1). In a separate study, HHC was found to be non-toxic to both NFF and RK cells (see<br>
again Table 1). When compared to cisplatin, a benchmark chemotherapeutic agent, the<br>
degree of toxicity exhibited by HMC and HHC is mild.<br>

fibroblasts (NFF) and rabbit kidney cells.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.2. In vitro efficacy against cancer cells<br>
When compared to DHE IC50 values, HMC demonstrated markedly superior activity (~5-<br>
10 fold greater) against the multi-drug resistant, p53 mt ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3),<br>
the AR negative, p53 Mt prostate cancer cell line (PC3), both ER positive (p53 wt) and<br>
negative (p53 mt) breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 respectively), p53<br>
Mt Glioma (HTB-138), p53 Mt pancreatic cancer (HPAC) and p53 Mt large cell lung<br>
cancer (Table 2). HMC exhibited anti-cancer activity comparable to that of DHE against<br>
all other cell lines tested (Table 1). Particular efficacy of HMC was noted against<br>
melanoma cells. (Table 2.1 and Fig 2). This represents a substantial advantage over the<br>
prior art.<br>
HMC was differentially active against 2 separate colorectal cell lines, with marked activity<br>
observed against HT-29 cells and somewhat less activity against HCT-15. It is noted that<br>
HT-29 and HCT-15 are COX-2 positive and deficient respectively. When examined<br>
microscopically and compared to cells treated with vehicle only, HMC treated SKOV-3<br>
cells exhibited morphological changes consistent with cells undergoing apoptosis (cell<br>
enlargement, granular appearance in cytosol and blebbling of plasma membrane). In<br>
contrast SKOV-3 cells exposed to 100 uM Dehydroequol after 18 hr retained a relatively<br>
normal morphology, comparable with that of vehicle only treated cells.<br>

representative of different malignancies.<br>
(Table Remobed)<br>
In further studies, the cytotoxicity of various compounds described herein against various<br>
cell lines was determined. Compound 14-ene is the 3-ene chromene precursor to .the<br>
correspondingly reduced chroman, compound 14. It was observed that compounds 1,2<br>
and 11 show the best efficacy against most all cancer cell lines. Compound 14 shows<br>
slightly better efficacy in general compared to its corresponding 14-ene and to compound 6<br>
(Table 2.2).<br>

3.3.1. HMC Pharmacokinetics - oral<br>
When compared with the pharmacokinetic profile of orally dosed DHE, HMC<br>
administered via the same route and dosage (50 mg/kg), HMC exhibited a Cmax of<br>
141 μM (achieved after 1 hr) compared to 511 μM for DHE (achieved after 15 min) (Table<br>
3 and Figure 3). Like DHE, HMC is also subject to conjugation with low plasma<br>
concentrations of the free form of the molecule observed (1.3 uM after 30 min) (Table 3<br>
and Figure 3). This is less than half the maximum concentration of free dehydroequol<br>
achieved using the same dosage regimen (3.3 uM after 15 min) (Figure 3). The ratio of<br>
free:total is greater for HMC when compared to DHE (0.92 vs 0.64 respectively).<br>

with 50 mg/kg of either HMC or DHE p.o.<br>

3.3.2. HMC and HHC Pharmacokinetics - oral<br>
Human patients were orally dosed with 200 mg of either HMC or HHC. For each<br>
challenged patient, blood was taken over a 6 hour period and the results averaged to<br>
characterise the plasma pharrnacokinetics. The initial results give an oral half life of 3.99<br>
hours for HMC and 3.26 hours for HHC (Table 3.2).<br>

200 mg of either HMC or HHC<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.4. HMC Pharmacokinetics — i.v. and i.p.<br>
When formulated in HPBCD and delivered i.v., extremely high levels of HMC were<br>
observed in the blood equating to 1 mM of drug, 15 min post administration (Figure 4).<br>
Elimination kinetics of i.v. delivered HMC were biphasic with HMC being rapidly<br>
excreted from blood at a rate of ~1000 uM/hr in the first hr post administration. Assuming<br>
linear excretion, this rate slowed to 0.97 uM/hr in hours 1 -4 hr post administration. When<br>
the same formulation was administered i.p., approximately 1 log less HMC was observed<br>
in plasma (131 μ,M by i.p. administration vs 1069 μM by i.v. administration) up to 1 hour<br>
post administration (Fig 4). Elimination kinetics by i.p. administration however, was much<br>
slower during this period (112 uM/hr) thus resulting in a serum concentration some 4.5<br>
fold higher at 1 hr post administration (18.7 by i.p. vs 3.98 by i.v.). Conversely, in hours 1-<br>
4 post administration, elimination kinetics was faster after i.p. administration when<br>
compared to i.v. (4.6 μM/hr by i.p. vs 0.97 f^M/hr by i.v.). These data confirm that HMC<br>
is highly bioavailable in its free state when administered by i.v. or i.p. routes. In<br>
conjunction with oral PK data, these data also suggest that HMC is susceptible to rapid<br>
removal by GI detoxification enzymes. Large concentrations of free HMC were observed<br>
in urine over 0.5, 1 and 4hr where collected (3.3 mM, 3.9 mM and 0.093 mM).<br>

administration of HMC formulated in 20% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin at a dose of 50<br>
mg/kg). Inset shows HMC concentrations in serum.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.5. Pilot in vivo efficacy study - HP AC tumour bearing mice<br>
HMC when dosed daily, i.p. at 100 mg/kg significantly retarded the proliferation of HP AC<br>
tumours over the treatment period when compared to vehicle control (Figures). When the<br>
mean terminal tumour mass was assessed a significant reduction in final tumour burden<br>
(%T/C = 62) was also noted (Figure 6). Importantly, no signs of toxicity were noted in<br>
10 animals dosed with HMC at 100 mg/kg daily for 15 days as determined by weight loss.<br>
Indeed animals treated with HMC appeared to thrive when compared to control (Figure 7).<br>
Organs (liver, kidney, spleen, femur, stomach and colon) were collected and submitted for<br>
histopathological assessment by Rothwell consulting. A limited serum biochemistry<br>
analysis was also conducted. These data confirm that HMC demonstrates antitumorigenie<br>
activity against HPAC tumours in vivo.<br>
3,5.1, Histpathological examination of HMC treated groups<br>
Histopathological examination of haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections cut from<br>
formalin-fixed tissues from two series of experimental mice was made. The liver, kidney,<br>
stomach and colon were examined for evidence of toxic damage, the spleen and bone<br>
marrow for evidence of myelosuppression and the tumour for degree of necrosis. A score<br>
of 0-5 was allocated to each rumour specimen for the degree of necrosis present, a 0 score<br>
representing, no necrosis and a score of 5, total necrosis. The sections were scored 'blind'<br>
on two separate occasions and the final score given in the results is the mean of these two<br>
scores.<br>
-47-<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.5.1.1, Overview of results<br>
No evidence of toxicity or myelosuppression was detected in sections cut from the tissues<br>
of the drug-treated mice. However, in all the drug-treated mice there were patchy<br>
mild/moderately severe chronic inflammatory changes affecting the serosa and attached<br>
mesentery, as well as reactive changes of the mesothelial cells, in some of the tissues<br>
examined. These changes are consistent with the intra-peritoneal injection of a mildly<br>
irritant material.<br>
Significant necrosis of tumour tissue was not detected in control specimens 1/8 and 1/11.<br>
However, there was considerable necrosis in the rumour sections from the drug-treated<br>
mice.<br>
3.5.1.2. Serum biochemistry of HMC treated mice in comparison to control<br>
Alakalines phosphatase (ALP), alanine transferase (ALT) and creatine (Cre) were assessed<br>
in HMC treated vs control animals. ALP and Cre levels were similar to control and fell<br>
within normal ranges (for rat) however, ALT levels in vehicle control and HMC treated<br>
groups were much lower than no treatment control levels.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.6. HMC induced apoptosis in melanoma cells and normal fibroblasts<br>
3.6.1. Melanoma<br>
HMC induced apoptosis in all TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cells at<br>
concentrations down to 2uM (~7-10% apoptosis) over 24 aind 48 hrs of exposure (Table 7<br>
and Figure 8A). At the clinically significant drug concentration of 4 μM, the incidence of<br>
apoptotic cells after 24 hr exposure to HMC rose to 25% and 39% in TRAIL sensitive<br>
(MEL-RM) and TRAIL negative (IGR3) cell lines respectively (Table 7 and Figure 8A).<br>
The incidence of HMC induced apoptosis at 4 uM after 24 hr exposure in the other cell<br>
lines was ~9%. In comparison, the incidence apoptosis in DHE- treated cells at a<br>
concentratoin of 4 μM after 24 hr exposure was 0-1 %. Over 48 hr at the same<br>
concentration of HMC (4μM), the incidence of apoptosis rose to 21-42 % in all cell lines<br>
examined (Table 7 and Figure 8B). DHE was the only other agent to induce moderate<br>
levels of apoptosis after 48 hr exposure at a concentration of 4μM, but only in ME4405<br>
(14%) and Mel-AT (15%) cell lines (Table 7 and Figure 8B).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.6.2. Normal fibroblasts<br>
Studies were conducted on normal fibroblasts (MRC-5) and TRAIL-sensitive melanoma<br>
cells (ME4405 and MEL-RM) using 8μM of either DHE or HMC over 24 and 48 hr of<br>
exposure (Figure 9). These data demonstrate that HMC, and to a lesser extent DHE,<br>
induced marked levels of apoptosis in both melanoma cell lines over 24 and 48hr.<br>
Importantly, while promoting programmed cell death in malignant cells, normal fibroblasts<br>
were shown to both HMC and DHE induced apoptosis at 8 μ,M drug over 24 and 48 hr of<br>
exposure. These data confirm that HMC is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells.<br>
The isoflavan compounds of the invention exhibit a superior efficacy profile against all<br>
cancers tested when compared to DHE. While HMC is marginally more toxic than DHE in<br>
NFF and RBC cells, HMC is markedly less toxic than cisplatin. HMC delivered orally in<br>
mice is less bioavailable when compared to DHE but the ratio of free:total is greater.<br>
HPBCD-formulated HMC was markedly bioavailable in its free form when delivered i.v<br>
and i.p. Significant serum concentrations of free HMC post delivery i.p. were some 18 fold<br>
above that of orally delivered HMC. It has been demonstrated that HMC, formulated in<br>
20% HPBCD and delivered i.p., exerts a moderate antitumorigenic activity against HP AC<br>
tumours in vivo. HMC when delivered at 100 mg/kg to mice is not toxic to major organs as<br>
determined by histopathology however, in all the drug-treated mice there were patchy<br>
mild/moderately severe chronic inflammatory changes affecting the serosa and attached<br>
mesentery, as well as reactive changes of the mesothelial cells which are consistent with<br>
the intra-peritoneal injection of a mildly irritant material.<br>
HMC induced moderate-strong levels of apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant and TRAILsensitive<br>
melanoma cells after both 24 and 48 hrs of exposure. Normal fibroblast cells<br>
were resistant to apoptosis after 48 hrs exposure DHE induces mild-moderate levels of<br>
apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant and TRAIL-sensitive melanoma cells after 48 hrs of<br>
exposure. Normal fibroblast cells were resistant to apoptosis after 48 hr exposure. The<br>
ability of both HMC and DHE to induce apoptosis in caspase negative cells suggest that an<br>
operational extrinsic programmed cell death pathway is not essential for HMC and DHE<br>
mediated apoptosis.<br>
3.7 In vitro HMC synergistic toxicity in cancer cells when combined with cisplatin,<br>
paclitaxel and gemcitabine, camptothecin, topotecan and doxorubicin<br>
3.7.1. HMC combination with cisplatin against the MM200 melanoma cell line.<br>
HMC synergy with cisplatin was assessed either in combination over 5 days exposure or in<br>
sequence (HMC -&gt; cisplatin) against the MM200 melanoma cell line. It was difficult to<br>
assess for synergisitic toxicity using a change in IC50 as a measure of synergy due to HMC<br>
toxicity as monotherapy (Table 8). 3D analysis of the data reveals that only additive<br>
toxicity was apparent vising the 5-day combination protocol (Fig. 11). Evidence of synergy<br>
using the HMC-cisplatin combination was further assessed using the HMC—&gt; cisplatin<br>
sequence (24hr exposure to each compound in sequence) against the melanoma cell line<br>
MM200. Using change in IC50 to assess for synergy it was noted that HMC at<br>
concentrations of 2 μM markedly chemosensitised the MM200 cells to cisplatin by &gt;1000<br>
fold (Table 8). HMC induced chemosensitisation of MM200 cells to cisplatin was<br>
confirmed using 3D analysis of the data (Fig. 1 IB). These data demonstrate that HMC is<br>
able to chemosensitise cancer cells, in this case melanoma, to cisplatin.<br>

Mel-RM melanoma cell line. Average IC50 data for each agent when assessed as a<br>
monotherapy or in combination are shown<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3.7.2 HMC combination with gemcitabine against the Mel-RM melanoma cells.<br>
HMC synergy with gemcitabine was assessed either in combination over 5 days exposure<br>
or in sequence (HMC -» gemcitabine) against the Mel-RM melanoma cell line. It was<br>
difficult to assess for synergisitic toxicity using a change in IC50 as a measure of synergy<br>
due to HMC toxicity as monotherapy (Table 9). 3D analysis of the data reveals that 5-day<br>
combination protocol did not elicit synergisitic toxicity against the Mel-RM cell line.<br>
Evidence of synergy using the HMC-gemcitabine combination was further assessed using<br>
the HMC-* gemcitabine sequence (24hr exposure to each compound in sequence) against<br>
the melanoma cell line Mel-RM. Using change in ICSO to assess for synergy it was noted<br>
that HMC at concentrations of 2 and luM markedly chemosensitised the Mel-RM cells to<br>
gemcitabine by &gt;1000 fold. HMC-induced chemosensitisation of Mel-RM cells to<br>
gemcitabine was confirmed using 3D analysis of the data. These data demonstrate that<br>
HMC is able to chemosesnsitise cancer cells to gemcitabine.<br>

3.7.3. HMC combination with paclitaxel against the 4405 melanoma cell line.<br>
HMC synergy with paclitaxel was assessed either in combination over 5 days exposure or<br>
in sequence (HMC -» paclitaxel) against the 4405 melanoma cell line. It was difficult to<br>
assess for synergisitic toxicity using a change in IC50 as a measure of synergy due to HMC<br>
toxicity as monotherapy (Table 10). A 30 fold reduction in IC50 was noted in the<br>
combination experiment when compared to the paclitaxel monotherapy. However, 3D<br>
analysis of the data revealed that the 5-day combination protocol did not elicit synergisitic<br>
toxicity against the 4405 cell line. Evidence of synergy using the HMC-paclitaxel<br>
combination was further assessed using the HMC-&gt; paclitaxel sequence (24hr exposure to<br>
each compound in sequence) against the melanoma cell line 4405. Using change in IC50<br>
to assess for synergy it was noted that HMC at concentrations of 2 jaM markedly<br>
chemosensitised the 4405 cells to paclitaxel by &gt;1000 fold (Table 10). HMC-induced<br>
chemosensitisation of MM200 cells to paclitaxel was confirmed using 3D analysis of the<br>
data. These data demonstrate that HMC is able to chemosesnsitise cancer cells to<br>
pacltaxel.<br>

3.7.4. HMC combination with topotecan against the MM200 melanoma cell line.<br>
HMC synergy with topotecan was assessed either in combination over 5 days exposure or<br>
in sequence (HMC -»topotecan) against the MM200 melanoma cell line. It was difficult<br>
to assess for synergisitic toxicity using a change in IC50 as a measure of synergy due to<br>
HMC toxicity as monotherapy (Table 8). 3D analysis of the data confirmed that the 5-day<br>
combination protocol did not elicit synergisitic toxicity against the MM200 cell line.<br>
Evidence of synergy using the HMC-gemcitabine combination was further assessed using<br>
the HMC-» topotecan sequence (24hr exposure to each compound in sequence) against the<br>
melanoma cell line MM200. Using change in IC50 to assess for synergy it was noted that<br>
HMC at a concentration of 2 u.M markedly chemosensitised the MM200 cells to topotecan<br>
by &gt; 1000 fold (Table 11). HMC-induced chemosensitisation of MM200 cells to topotecan<br>
was confirmed using 3D analysis of the data. These data demonstrate that HMC is able to<br>
chemosesnsitise cancer cells to topotecan. From the 3D analysis the optimum combination<br>
of HMC and topotecan against the MM200 melanoma cell line would appear to be 2 u.M<br>
HMC and between 1 and 0.1 uM topotecan.<br>
-54-<br>

3.7.5. HMC combination with camptothecin against the Mel-RM melanoma ceil line.<br>
HMC synergy with doxorubicin was assessed either in combination over 5 days exposure<br>
or in sequence (HMC -» doxorubicin) against the Mel-RM melanoma cell line. It was<br>
difficult to assess for synergisitic toxicity using a change in IC50 as a measure of synergy<br>
due to HMC toxicity as monotherapy (Table 12). 3D analysis of the data confirmed that<br>
the 5-day combination protocol did not elicit synergisitic toxicity against the Mel-RM cell<br>
line, indeed evidence of antagonism was noted. Evidence of synergy using the HMCdoxorubicin<br>
combination was further assessed using the HMC-» doxorubicin sequence<br>
protocol (24hr exposure to each compound in sequence) against the melanoma cell line<br>
Mel-RM. Using change in IC50 to assess for synergy it was noted that HMC at a<br>
concentration of 2 uM chemosensitised the Mel-RM cells to camptothecin by -12 fold<br>
(Table 12). 3D analysis of the data, however, reveal a marked degree of synergy between<br>
HMC and doxorubicin against Mel-RM cells. These data demonstrate that HMC is able to<br>
chemosesnsitise cancer cells to pacltaxel. From the 3D analysis the optimum combination<br>
of HMC and camptothecin against the MM200 melanoma cell line would appear to be 2<br>
uM HMC and between 1 and 0.1 (μ.M doxorubicin.<br>

3.8 Inhibition of TNFa in murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) by compounds 4,6 &amp; 7<br>
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with<br>
PCS, 2mM glutarnine and 50U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Subconfluent cells were<br>
detached from the flask by gentle scraping and 24-well plates seeded at 5 x 10s cells per<br>
well and allowed to adhere for Ihr. Cells were treated with either test agent (in 0.025°/o<br>
DMSO) or vehicle alone, Ihr prior to the addition of 50ng/ml LPS. After incubation for 16<br>
hrs, culture media was collected and stored at -80°C for TNFa measurement using an<br>
enzyme immunometric assay (Becton Dickinson),<br>
Compound 6 and compound 7 of the present invention were tested and the results are<br>
shown in Figure 12, which indicated that the compounds tested inhibit TNFa in murine<br>
macrophages in a dose dependent manner over the concentration ranges tested.<br>
The raw data for compounds 6, 7 and additionally compound 4 is shown in Table 13<br>
below.<br>

3,9 Assessment of HHC as a chemosensitiser<br>
HHC was screened as chemosensitiser against a panel cell lines representative of a range<br>
cancer indications using a panel of cytotoxics commonly used in the treatment of cancer. It<br>
has emerged that HHC has an ability to strongly chemosensitise cancer cell lines from<br>
different pathologies to gemcitabine (ovarian, prostate, breast and pancreatic cancers, and<br>
glioma) (Table 14). Strong synergy has been noted using HHC:cisplatin against ovarian<br>
and prostate cancer, mild synergy against colorectal cancer cell lines and synergy was not<br>
observed in pancreatic cancer and glioma. Moderate synergy has been noted using the<br>
HHCrpaclitaxel combination against breast and colorectal cancer, and melanoma cell lines.<br>
Equivocal synergy data using the HHC:paclitaxel combination has been noted against<br>
ovarian cancer and glioma cell lines and there was no evidence of synergy against prostate<br>
and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Data has revealed that HHC is able to strongly<br>
chemosensitise the MM96L melanoma cell line to cisplatin, carboplatin and decarbazine<br>
(Table 7).<br>

3.10. Efficacy of DHE, HMC and HHC against selected melanoma cell lines.<br>
In comparison with DHE, both HMC and HHC showed excellent anti-cancer activity<br>
against a range of melanoma cell lines. HHC was the most efficacious agent against all<br>
melanoma cell lines tested to date having sub 1 uM IC50 values (Table 15).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
4.0 Effect on murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) stimulated with LPS<br>
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with<br>
foetal calf serum (PCS), 2mM glutamine and 50U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.<br>
Subconfluent cells were detached from the flask by gentle scraping and 24-well plates<br>
seeded at 5 x 10s cells per well and allowed to adhere for Ihr. Cells were then treated<br>
either test compound at a concentration of lOμM (in 0.025% DMSO) or vehicle alone, and<br>
incubated for Ihr. LPS 50ng/ml (LPS -Sigma-Aldrich) was then added. After incubation<br>
for 16hrs, culture media was collected and stored at -80°C for ecosanoid measurements<br>
using enzyme immunometric assays (PGE2 and TXB2 - Cayman Chemical).<br>
Table 16: Percentage change in eicosanoid synthesis after incubating test compound at<br>
lOμM compared with incubation with vehicle alone. Positive values indicate enhanced<br>
synthesis; negative values indicate inhibition of synthesis and consequently suggest antiinflammatory<br>
