RELATED APPLICATIONS SECTION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/843,644, filed on September 11, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/895,873, filed on March 20,2007, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Erb-Bl) belongs to a family of proteins, involved in the proliferation of normal and malignant cells (Artega, C.L., J. Clin Oncol 19, 2001, 32-40). Overexpression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is present in at least 70% of human cancers (Seymour, L.K., Curr Drug Targets 2, 2001, 117-133) such as, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), breast cancers, gliomas, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and prostate cancer (Raymond et al. Drugs 60 Suppl 1, 2000, discussion 41-2; Salomon etal., Crit Rev OncolHematol 19,1995,183-232; Voldborg et al., Ann Oncol 8,1997, 1197-1206). The EGFR-TK is therefore widely recognized as an attractive target for the design and development of compounds that can specifically bind and inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity and its signal transduction pathway in cancer cells, and thus can serve as either diagnostic or therapeutic agents. For example, the EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) reversible inhibitor, TARCEVA®, was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC and advanced pancreatic cancer. Other anti-EGFR targeted molecules have also been approved such as IRESSA®.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Despite the early success of Tarceva, it has become clear that selectively targeting individual kinases can lead to the development of drug resistant tumors. Cells that have developed mutations within the drug/kinase binding pocket display a growth advantage in the presence of drug eventually leading to disease progression. Current clinical strategies<br>
aimed at combining these molecularly targeted drugs with standard chemotherapeutics, radiation, or other targeted agents will lead to novel strategies to improve overall response rate and increase the number of complete remissions.<br>
Furthermore, elucidation of the complex and multifactorial nature of various diseases that involve multiple pathogenic pathways and numerous molecular components suggests that multi-targeted therapies may be advantageous over mono-therapies. Recent combination therapies with two or more agents for many such diseases in the areas of oncology, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and other complex pathologies demonstrate that this combinatorial approach may provide advantages with respect to overcoming drug resistance, reduced toxicity and, in some circumstances, a synergistic therapeutic effect compared to the individual components.<br>
Certain cancers have been effectively treated with such a combinatorial approach; however, treatment regimes using a cocktail of cytotoxic drugs often are limited by dose limiting toxicities and drug-drug interactions. More recent advances with molecularly targeted drugs have provided new approaches to combination treatment for cancer, allowing multiple targeted agents to be used simultaneously, or combining these new therapies with standard chemotherapeutics or radiation to improve outcome without reaching dose limiting toxicities. However, the ability to use such combinations currently is limited to drugs that show compatible pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic properties. In addition, the regulatory requirements to demonstrate safety and efficacy of combination therapies can be more costly and lengthy than corresponding single agent trials. Once approved, combination strategies may also be associated with increased costs to patients, as well as decreased patient compliance owing to the more intricate dosing paradigms required.<br>
In the field of protein and polypeptide-based therapeutics it has become commonplace to prepare conjugates or fusion proteins that contain most or all of the amino acid sequences of two different proteins/polypeptides and that retain the individual binding activities of the separate proteins/polypeptides. This approach is made possible by independent folding of the component protein domains and the large size of the conjugates that permits the components to bind their cellular targets in an essentially independent manner. Such an approach is not, however, generally feasible in the case of small molecule therapeutics, where even minor structural modifications can lead to major changes in target binding and/or the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the resulting molecule.<br>
The use of EGFR inhibitors in combination with histone deacetylases (HDAC) has been shown to produce synergistic effects. Histone acetylation is a reversible modification, with deacetylation being catalyzed by a family of enzymes termed HDAC's. HDAC's are represented by X genes in humans and are divided into four distinct classes (JMol Biol, 2004, 338:1, 17-31). In mammalians class I HDAC's (HDACl-3, and HDAC8) are related to yeast RPD3 HDAC, class 2 (HDAC4-7, HDAC9 and HDAC10) related to yeast HDAl, class 4 (HDAC 11), and class 3 (a distinct class encompassing the sirtuins which are related to yeast Sir2).<br>
Csordas, Biochem. J., 1990,286: 23-38 teaches that histones are subject to post-translational acetylation of the, e-amino groups of N-terminal lysine residues, a reaction that is catalyzed by histone acetyl transferase (HATl). Acetylation neutrahzes the positive charge of the lysine side chain, and is thought to impact chromatin structure. Indeed, access of transcription factors to chromatin templates is enhanced by histone hyperacetylation, and enrichment in underacetylated histone H4 has been found in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome (Taunton et al. Science, 1996, 272:408-411). In the case of tumor suppressor genes, transcriptional silencing due to histone modification can lead to oncogenic transformation and cancer.<br>
Several classes of HDAC inhibitors currently are being evaluated by clinical investigators. The first FDA approved HDAC inhibitor is Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Zolinza®) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Other HDAC inhibitors include hydroxamic acid derivatives; PXD101 and LAQ824, are currently in the clinical development. In the benzamidc class of HDAC inhibitors, MS-275, MGCD0103 and CI-994 have reached clinical trials. Mourae et al. (Abstract #4725, AACR 2005), demonstrate that thiophenyl modification of benzamides significantly enhance HDAC inhibitory activity against HDAC 1.<br>
Recent advances suggest that EGFR-TK inhibitors in combination with HDAC inhibitors may provide advantageous results in the treatment of cancer. For example, co-treatment with SAHA significantly increased EGFR2 antibody trastuzumab-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells and induced synergistic cytotoxic effects against the breast cancer cells (Bali, Clin. Cancer Res., 2005,11, 3392). HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA, have demonstrated synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects when used in combination with gefitinib in head and neck cancer cell lines, including lines that are resistant to gefitinib monotherapy (Bruzzese et al., Proc. AACR, 2004). Pretreating<br>
gefitinib resistant cell lines with the HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, led to a growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effect of gefitinib similar to that seen in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines including those harboring EGFR mutations (Witta S.E., et al. Cancer Res 66:2, 2006, 944-50). The HDAC inhibitor PXD101 has been shown to act synergistically to inhibit proliferation with the EGFRl inhibitor Tarceva® (erlotinib) (WO2006082428A2).<br>
Current therapeutic regimens of the types described above attempt to address the problem of drug resistance by the administration of multiple agents. However, the combined toxicity of multiple agents due to off-target side effects as well as drug-drug interactions often limits the effectiveness of this approach. Moreover, it often is diflficult to combine compounds having differing pharmacokinetics into a single dosage form, and the consequent requirement of taking multiple medications at different time intervals leads to problems with patient compUance that can undermine the efficacy of the drug combinations. In addition, the health care costs of combination therapies may be greater than the cost of single molecule therapies. Furthermore, it may be more difficult to obtain regulatory approval of a combination therapy since the burden for demonstrating activity/safety of a combination of two agents may be greater than for a single agent (Dancey J &amp; Chen H, Nat. Rev. DrugDis., 2006, 5:649). The development of novel agents that target multiple therapeutic targets selected not by virtue of cross reactivity, but through rational design will help improve patient outcome while avoiding these limitations. Thus, enormous efforts are still directed to the development of selective anti-cancer drugs as well as to new and more efficacious combinations of known anti-cancer drugs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to quinazolines containing zinc-binding moiety based derivatives that have enhanced and unexpected properties as inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK). The compounds of the present invention also act as HDAC or matrix mctalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors and HER2 inhibitors. Surprisingly, these compounds are active at multiple therapeutic targets and are effective for treating diseases related to EGFR-TK activity, HDAC activity and/or HER2 activity, such as cancer and proliferative diseases. Moreover, it has even more surprisingly been found that the compounds have enhanced activity when compared to the activities of separate molecules individually having the EGFR-TK and HDAC activities and combinations thereof In other words, the combination of pharmacophores into a single molecule may<br>
provide a synergistic effect as compared to the individual pharmacophores. More specifically, it has been found that it is possible to prepare compounds that simultaneously contain a first portion of the molecule that binds zinc ions and thus permits inhibition of HDAC and/or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and at least a second portion of the molecule that permits binding to a separate and distinct target that inhibits EGFR-TK and thus provide therapeutic benefit. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention inhibit EGFR-TK, HER2 and HDAC activity.<br>

Such combinations may enhance therapeutic efficacy over efficacy achieved by any of the agents alone and may prevent or delay the appearance of resistant mutational variants.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutic agents encompass a wide range of therapeutic treatments in the field of oncology. These agents are administered at various stages of the disease for the purposes of shrinking tumors, destroying remaining cancer cells left over after suR8ery, inducing remission, maintaining remission and/or alleviating symptoms relating to the cancer or its treatment. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents such as mustard gas derivatives (Mcchlorcthamine, cylophosphamidc, chlorambucil, melphalan, ifosfamide), ethylenimincs (thiotepa, hexamethylmelanine), Alkylsulfonates (Busulfan), Hydrazines and Triazines (Altretamine, Procarbazine, Dacarbazine and Temozolomide), Nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine and Streptozocin), Ifosfamide and metal salts (Carboplatin, Cisplatin, and Oxalipiatin); plant alkaloids such as Podophyllotoxins (Etoposide and Tenisopide), Taxanes (Paclitaxel and Docetaxel), Vinca alkaloids (Vincristine, Vinblastine, Vindesine and Vinorclbine), and Camptothecan analogs (Irinotecan and Topotecan); anti-tumor antibiotics such as Chromomycins (Dactinomycin and Plicamycin), Anthracyclines (Doxorubicin, Daunonibicin, Epirubicin, Mitoxantrone, Valrubicin and Idarubicin), and miscellaneous antibiotics such as Mitomycin, Actinomycin and Bleomycin; anti-metabolites such as folic acid antagonists (Methotrexate, Pemetrexed, Raltitrexed, Aminopterin), pyrimidine antagonists (5-Fluorouracil, Floxuridine, Cytarabine, Capecitabine, and Gemcitabine), purine antagonists (6-Mercaptopurine and 6-Thioguanine) and adenosine deaminase inhibitors (Cladribine, Fludarabine, Mercaptopurine, Clofarabine, Thioguanine, Nelarabine and Pentostatin); topoisomerase inhibitors such as topoisomerase I inhibitors (Ironotecan, topotecan) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (Amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide); monoclonal antibodies (Alemtuzumab, Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Rituximab, Trastuzumab, Ibritumomab Tioxetan, Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Tositumomab,<br>

Chemoprotective agents act to protect the body or minimize the side effects of chemotherapy. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, amfostine, mesna, and dexrazoxane.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the subject compounds are administered in combination with radiation therapy. Radiation is commonly delivered internally (implantation of radioactive material near cancer site) or extemally from a machine that employs photon (x-ray or gamma-ray) or particle radiation. Where the combination therapy further comprises radiation treatment, the radiation treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and radiation treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the radiation treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.<br>
It will be appreciated that compounds of the invention can be used in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent. One form of immunotherapy is the generation of an active systemic tumor-specific immune response of host origin by administering a vaccine composition at a site distant from the tumor. Various types of vaccines have been proposed, including isolated tumor-antigen vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines. Another approach is to use tumor cells from the subject to be treated, or a derivative of such cells (reviewed by Schirrmacher et ai (1995) J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 121:487). In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,596, Hanna Jr. et al. claim a method for treating a resectable carcinoma to prevent recurrence or metastases, comprising suR8ically removing the tumor, dispersing the cells with collagenase, irradiating the cells, and vaccinating the patient with at least three consecutive doses of about 10^ cells.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention may advantageously be used in conjunction with one or more adjunctive therapeutic agents. Examples of suitable agents for adjunctive therapy include a 5HTi agonist, such as a triptan (e.g. sumatriptan or naratriptan); an adenosine Al agonist; an EP ligand; an NMDA modulator, such as a glycine antagonist; a sodium channel blocker (e.g. lamotrigine); a substance P antagonist<br>
(e.g. an NK1 antagonist); a cannabinoid; acetaminophen or phenacetin; a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; a leukotriene receptor antagonist; a DMARD (e.g. methotrexate); gabapentin and related compounds; a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. amitryptilline); a neurone stabilising antiepileptic drug; a mono-amineR8ic uptake inhibitor (e.g. venlafaxine); a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, such as an iNOS or an nNOS inhibitor; an inhibitor of the release, or action, of tumour necrosis factor .alpha.; an antibody therapy, such as a monoclonal antibody therapy; an antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside inhibitor (e.g. lamivudine) or an immune system modulator (e.g. interferon); an opioid analgesic; a local anaesthetic; a stimulant, including caffeine; an H2-antagonist (e.g. ranitidine); a proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole); an antacid (e.g. aluminium or magnesium hydroxide; an antiflatulent (e.g. simethicone); a decongestant (e.g. phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine, naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxyephedrine); an antitussive (e.g. codeine, hydrocodone, carmiphen, carbetapentane, or dextramethorphan); a diuretic; or a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine.<br>
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all matrix components. Over 20 MMP modulating agents are in pharmaceutical develop, almost half of which are indicated for cancer. The University of Toronto researchers have reported that HDACs regulate MMP expression and activity in 3T3 cells. In particular, inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin A (TSA), which has been shown to prevent tumorigenesis and metastasis, decreases mRNA as well as zymographic activity of gelatinase A (MMP2; Type IV coUagenase), a matrix metalloproteinase, which is itself, implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis (AilenbeR8 M., Silverman M., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 , 298:110-115). Another recent article that discusses the relationship of HDAC and MMPs can be found in Young D.A., et al.. Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy, 2005, 7: 503. Furthermore, the commonality between HDAC and MMPs inhibitors is their zinc-binding functionality. Therefore, in one aspect of the invention, compounds of the invention can be used as MMP inhibitors and may be of use in the treatment of disorders relating to or associated with dysregulation of MMP. The overexpression and activation of MMPs are known to induce tissue destruction and are also associated with a number of specific diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, cancer and atherosclerosis.<br>
The compounds may also be used in the treatment of a disorder involving, relating to or, associated with dysregulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC). There are a number of disorders that have been implicated by or known to be mediated at least in part by HDAC activity, where HDAC activity is known to play a role in triggering disease onset, or whose symptoms are known or have been shown to be alleviated by HDAC inhibitors. Disorders of this type that would be expected to be amenable to treatment with the compounds of the invention include the following but not limited to: Anti-proliferative disorders (e.g. cancers); Neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's Disease, Polyglutamine disease, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Seizures, Striatonigral degeneration.

Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the compound can be formulated in an aqueous solution for intravenous injection. In one embodiment, solubilizing agents can be suitably employed.

In a particularly preferred embodiment, the inclusion complex comprises a cyclodextrin and a compound selected from the group consisting of compound 12 and compound 18 or a geometric isomer, enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug or solvate thereof<br>
Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligomers of dextrose with a truncated cone structure consisting of a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior cavity. A cyclodextrin can form an inclusion complex with a guest molecule by complexing with all or a portion of a hydrophobic guest molecule within its cavity (for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,727,064, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). The size of the cavity is determined by the number of glucopyranose units in the cyclodextrin. Alpha- (a), beta- (B) and gamma- (y) cyclodextrins are the most common cyclodextrins and possess six, seven and eight glucopyranose units, respectively.   Because natural cyclodextrins have relatively low aqueous solubility and are associated with toxicity, chemically modified cyclodextrin derivatives have been developed to overcome these limitations. Such cyclodextrin derivatives typically possess a chemical modification at one or more of the 2,<br>
3, or 6 position hydroxyl groups. Cyclodextrin derivatives have, for example, been described in U.S. Pat.Nos. 5,134,127, 5,376,645, 5,571,534, 5,874,418, 6,046,177 and 6,133,248, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference and made a part hereof As used herein, the terms "cyclodextrin," "a -cyclodextrin," "ß-cyclodextrin and "-cyclodextrin" are intended to encompass unmodified cyclodextrins as well as chemically modified derivatives thereof<br>

In order to determine the minimum amount of cyclodextrin needed to solubilize a compound encompassed by Formulae I-IV, a plot of the compound's solubility versus cyclodextrin concentration can be carried out. By interpolating or extrapolating from<br>
the plot, a composition can be prepared that contains the minimum amount of cyclodextrin needed to dissolve the desired concentration of the active compound.<br>

Cancer Res., Vol. 43, pp. 175-203 (1985)). Anti-angiogenic agents interfere with this process. Examples of agents that interfere with several of these steps include thrombospondin-1, angiostatin, endostatin, interferon alpha and compounds such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors that block the actions of enzymes that clear and create paths for newly forming blood vessels to follow; compounds, such as .alpha.v.beta.3 inhibitors, that interfere with molecules that blood vessel cells use to bridge between a parent blood vessel and a tumor; agents, such as specific COX-2 inhibitors, that prevent the growth of cells that form new blood vessels; and protein-based compounds that simultaneously interfere with several of these taR8ets.<br>

In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention.<br>
The term "metastasis," as used herein, refers to the migration of cancer cells from the original tumor site through the blood and lymph vessels to produce cancers in other tissues. Metastasis also is the term used for a secondary cancer growing at a distant site.<br>
The term "neoplasm," as used herein, refers to an abnormal mass of tissue that results from excessive cell division. Neoplasms may be benign (not cancerous), or malignant (cancerous) and may also be called a tumor. The term "neoplasia" is the pathological process that results in tumor formation.<br>

The synthesized compounds can be separated from a reaction mixture and further purified by a method such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, or recrystallization. As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, further methods of synthesizing the compounds of the formulae herein will be evident to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an altemate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, Comprehensive OR8anic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in OR8anic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M.

The compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, or as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, other unsaturation, or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers and/or cis- and trans- isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon-heteroatom double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion.<br>
In some embodiments, the inventive compound is a crystalline or an amorphous form of a compound of the invention. In another embodiment, the inventive compound is a mixture of two or more crystalline forms of the compound. In a further embodiment, the invention is a crystalline form or a mixture of two or more crystalline forms of compound<br>

In a further embodiment, the crystalline form of compound 12 exhibits a differential scanning calorimetry pattem that is substantially the same as the differential scanning calorimetry pattem of the compound produced according the Example 8 (Method 2).<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient" means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as com starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt;<br>
gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safElower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other nontoxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrastemal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions, may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a<br>
sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water. Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in tum, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoestcrs) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof<br>
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propcllants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the<br>
compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
For pulmonary delivery, a therapeutic composition of the invention is formulated and administered to the patient in solid or liquid particulate form by direct administration e.g., inhalation into the respiratory system. Solid or liquid particulate forms of the active compound prepared for practicing the present invention include particles of respirable size: that is, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. Delivery of aerosolized therapeutics, particularly aerosolized antibiotics, is known in the art (see, for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,068 to VanDevanter etal, U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,269 to Smith et al. and WO 98/43,650 by Montgomery, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). A discussion of pulmonary delivery of antibiotics is also found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,969, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
By a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of the invention is meant an amount of the compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated subject, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). An effective amount of the compound described above may range from about 0.1 mg/Kg to about 500 mg/Kg, preferably from about 1 to about 50 mg/Kg. Effective doses will also vary depending on route of administration, as well as the possibility of co-usage with other agents. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or contemporaneously with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other animal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50<br>

For example, 1000 mg compound, 345 mg tartaric acid (0.345 mg tartaric acid per mg compound) and 40 ml 30% Captisol or 1000 mg compound, 2.3 ml IN HCl (2.3 ul IN HCl per mg compound), 12 gram Captisol, Add water to 40 ml. Stock solution is diluted with 30% CAPTISOL before use.<br>
Example 77: Pharmacokinetics of test salts in plasma, lung and colon after intravenous administration<br>
20 mg/kg of hydrochloride, citrate, sodium and tartrate salts of compound 12 in 30% CAPTISOL was administered intravenously to mice in order to determine the concentration<br>
(ng/ml) over time (hours) of compound 12 after intravenous (iv) administration in plasma, lung and colon. The results of these studies are shown in FIG. 13. As shown there, similar plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics was observed for the sodum, hydrochloride and tartrate salts.<br>
Example 78: Pharmacokinetic study of compound 12 formulation in mice<br>
20 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg of a hydrochloride salt of compound 12 in 30% CAPTISOL was administered intravenously (iv) and intraperitoneally (ip) to mice and the half life (tl/2), maximal observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUG) were determined. As shown in Table H below, the concentration of compound 12 is dose proportional when administered intravenously but not intraperitoneally.
