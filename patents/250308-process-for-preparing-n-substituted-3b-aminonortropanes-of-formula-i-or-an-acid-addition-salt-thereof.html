METHOD FOR PRODUCING N-SUBSTITUTED 3P-AMINONORTROPANES<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
1. TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing N-substituted 3p-aminonortropanes of formula I (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 has the meaning given in the claims, from the corresponding 3-oxonortropane or the corresponding 3 a-aminonortropane, in which the latter is converted with an arylmethylamine or an arylaldehyde into the corresponding imines which are then tautomerised or isomerised and then hydrolysed.<br>
2. PRIOR ART<br>
The compounds of formula I are valuable intermediate products in the chemical synthesis of various pharmaceutical active substances (e.g. A. Nuhrich et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 31, 12, 1996, 957-964), or are pharmaceutical active substances themselves, particularly NMDA receptor modulators (e.g. A. H. Lewin et al., J. Med. Chem, 1998, 41, 988-995).<br>
By hydrogenation of tropanone-oximes in the presence of a platinum catalyst and a diluent under elevated pressure (e.g. S. Archer, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80, 1958, 4677), N-substituted 3-aminonortropanes are predominantly obtained in the a form.<br>
By reacting tropanone-oximes with metallic sodium in an alcohol (e.g. A. Nuhrich et al., loc. cit) predominantly the p-isomers of the N-substituted 3-aminonortropanes are obtained.<br>
However, this process is of only limited use for large-scale industrial production for safety reasons.<br>
The aim of the present invention was therefore to propose a method of producing N-substituted 3p-aminonortropanes of formula I which can be carried out on an industrial scale, with high yields and with favourable space/time ratios. The invention also set out to provide 3p-aminonortropanes of formula I which are substantially free from the corresponding 3a-isomers.<br>
This objective was achieved according to the invention by the provision of a process in which the 3p-aminonortropane is obtained starting from a correspondingly substituted 3-oxonortropane or a correspondingly substituted 3a-aminonortropane.<br>
The process according to the invention makes it possible to prepare 30-aminonortropanes on an industrial scale in a high yield and purity.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing N-substituted 30-<br>
aminonortropanes of formula I or an acid addition salt thereof,<br>

H2N-CH2-Ar (IIIA) wherein<br>

wherein R1 and Ar have the meanings specified, as well as the tautomers or isomers of formulae IVA and IVB.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention the reaction between the compound of formula IIA and the compound of formula IIIA or between the compound of formula IIB and the compound of formula IIIB is carried out under dehydrating conditions.<br>
As a rule 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably 0.8 to 1.2 equivalents of a compound of formula IIA or IIB are reacted, based on one equivalent of formula IIIA or IIIB. Preferably, roughly equimolar amounts of compounds of formula IIA or IIB are used, based on formula IIIA or IIIB.<br>

As a rule the hydrolysis of the compound of formula IV is carried out in the presence of an acid. Strong inorganic or organic acids are preferred, such as for example sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid. It is particularly preferable to carry out the hydrolysis in a two-phase system consisting of an organic, slightly water-miscible solvent, particularly toluene or dichloromethane, water and the corresponding acid, particularly sulphuric acid.<br>
The hydrolysis is generally carried out at a temperature from 0 to 100 °C, preferably at 10 to 60 °C, particularly at 15 to 30 °C. Under the conditions specified the hydrolysis is complete in 15 to 360 minutes.In a particularly preferred embodiment the aqueous phase of the crude product thus obtained is separated off, and made slightly alkaline with a suitable base, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide, particularly sodium hydroxide solution, preferably to a pH of 7.5 to 9.5, particularly about 8.0.

The combined organic phases thus obtained areoncentrated. In this way the compound of formula I is obtained in the form of the free base.<br>
This may be converted into the corresponding acid addition salt by known methods, by treating with an inorganic or organic acid. Preferably for this purpose the free base is taken up in a polar solvent, preferably an alcohol such as for example methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, water or a mixture thereof, particularly a mixture of ethanol and water and adjusted to a slightly basic pH with the corresponding acid, preferably an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid.<br>
The precipitate of the salt thus formed is separated off, washed with a polar solvent and dried. In this way the product is obtained in pure crystalline form without any further purification.<br>
Other advantageous aspects of the procedure according to the invention are the high space/time yield in the present process and also the high yield and purity of the intermediate products, which can be further processed without chromatographic purification.<br>
