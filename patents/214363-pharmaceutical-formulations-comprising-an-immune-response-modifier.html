				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical formulations comprising at<br>
least one immune response modifier chosen from imidazoquinoline amines,<br>
imidazopyridine amines, 6,7-fused cycloalkylimidazopyridine amines, 1,2-bridged<br>
imidazoquinoline amines, thiazoloquinoline amines, oxazoloquinoline amines,	r<br>
thiazolopyridine amines, oxazolopyridine amines, imidazonaphthyridine amines, imidazotetrahydronaphthyridine amines, and thiazolonaphthyridine amines. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to topical formulations for application to the skin of a mammal. Other embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods for treating dermal diseases.<br>
Background<br>
Many imidazoquinoline amine, imidazopyridine amine, 6,7-fused cycloalkylimidazopyridine amine, 1,2-bridged imidazoquinoline amine, thiazoloquinoline amine, oxazoloquinoline amine, thiazolopyridine amine, oxazolopyridine amine, imidazonaphthyridine amine, imidazotetrahydronaphthyridine amine, and thiazolonaphthyridine amine compounds have demonstrated potent immunostimulating, antiviral and antitumor (including anticancer) activity, and have also been shown to be useful as vaccine adjuvants. These compounds are hereinafter collectively referred to as "IRM" (immune response modifier) compounds.    One of these IRM compounds, known as imiquimod, has been commercialized in a topical formulation, Aldaratm, for the treatment of anogenital warts associated with human papillomavirus.<br>
The mechanism for the antiviral and antitumor activity of these IRM compounds is thought to be due in substantial part to enhancement of the immune response by induction of various important cytokines (e.g., interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, etc.). Such compounds have been shown to stimulate a rapid release of certain monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines and are also capable of stimulating B cells to<br><br>
secrete antibodies which play an important role in these IRM compounds" antiviral and antitumor activities. One of the predominant immunostimulating responses to these compounds is the induction of interferon (IFN)-a production, which is believed to be very important in the acute antiviral and antitumor activities seen. Moreover, up regulation of other cytokines such as, for example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 also have potentially beneficial activities and are believed to contribute to the antiviral and antitumor properties of these compounds.<br>
Although some of the beneficial effects of IRMs are known, the ability to provide therapeutic benefit via topical application of an IRM compound for treatment of a particular condition at a particular location may be hindered by a variety of factors. These factors include irritation of the skin to which the formulation is applied, formulation wash away, insolubility and/or degradation of the IRM compound in the formulation, physical instability of the formulation (e.g., separation of components, thickening, precipitation/agglomerization of active ingredient, and the like), poor permeation, and undesired systemic delivery of the topically applied IRM compound. Accordingly, there is a continuing need for new methods and formulations to provide the greatest therapeutic benefit from this class of compounds.<br>

In some embodiments, the topical formulations of the present invention are prepared using the free base form of the IRM compound.<br>
The amount of an IRM compound that will be therapeutically effective in a specific situation will depend on such things as the activity of the particular compound, the dosing regimen, the application site, the particular formulation and the condition being treated. As such, it is generally not practical to identify specific administration amounts herein; however, those skilled in the art will be able to determine appropriate therapeutically effective amounts based on the guidance provided herein, information available in the art pertaining to these compounds, and routine testing. The term "a therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of the compound sufficient to induce a therapeutic effect, such as cytokine induction, inhibition of TH2 immune response, antiviral or antitumor activity, reduction or elimination of postsurgical scarring, or reduction or resolution of actinic keratosis or pre-actinic keratosis lesions.<br>
In general, the amount of the IRM compound present in a topical formulation of the invention will be an amount effective to treat a targeted condition, to prevent recurrence of the condition, or to promote immunity against the condition. The amount or concentration of the IRM compound can range from 0.001% to 10% by weight based on the total formulation weight, such as, for example, from 0.03% to 5.0% by weight, or from 0.1 to 1.0% by weight. In certain embodiments, the amount of the IRM compound is at least 0.003%) by weight, such as, for example, at least 0.005%, at least 0.01%), at least 0.03%, at least 0.10%, at least 0.30% and at least 1.0%. In other embodiments, the amount of the IRM compound is at most 5.0% by weight, such as, for example, at most 3.0%, and at most 1.0%.<br>
The topical formulations of the invention additionally comprise a fatty acid. As used herein, the term "fatty acid" means a carboxylic acid, either saturated or unsaturated,<br><br>
comprising 6 to 28 carbon atoms, such as, for example, from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of such fatty acids include isostearic acid, oleic acid, and linear-or- branched chained carboxylic acids of 6 to 18 carbon atoms. The fatty acid maybe present in the formulation in an amount sufficient to solubilize the IRM compound. In one embodiment, the amount of the fatty acid can range from 0,05 % to 40 % by weight based on the total weight of the formulation, such as, for example, from 1% to 30%, from 3% to 15% and from 5% to 10%. In certain embodiments, the amount of the fatty acid is at least 3.0% by weight, such as, for example, at least 5.0%, at least 10.0%, and at least 25%. The fatty acid component of the formulation can comprise one or more fatty acids.<br>
The topical formulations of the invention additionally comprise at least one hydrophobic, aprotic component miscible with the fatty acid and comprising a hydrocarbyl group of 7 or more carbon atoms. By "hydrophobic" is meant that the component is essentially insoluble in water, i.e. immiscible with water and unable to form a micelle in water, and does not contain polyoxyethylene or acid salt groups. Preferably the hydrophobic, aprotic component has a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) of less than 2. The HLB of a component may be determined as described, for example, in Attwood, D., Florence, A. T. Surfactant Systems: Their Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Biology. New York: Chapman &amp; Hall, 471-473, 1983. By "aprotic" is meant that the component cannot donate a proton to the IRM and does not contain groups such as carboxyl, hydroxy, primary and secondary amino, primary and secondary amido, or quaternary ammonium groups. Preferably this component has a pKa of at least 14.2 and does not substantially solubilize or form a complex such as an acid-base pair or complex or a hydrogen bond complex with the IRM compound. By "not substantially" is meant that the ratio of the IRM compound"s solubility in the hydrophilic, aprotic component to that in isostearic acid is less than 1:40.<br>
Formulations intended for dermal or topical use desirably haye a certain minimum amount of an oil phase to provide qualities such as spreadability, feel on the skin, texture, and so on. However, if all the components of the oil phase solubilize the IRM, then the degree of saturation of the IRM in the formulation will decrease, making it more difficult to deliver the IRM from the formulation to the skin. Addition of the hydrophobic, aprotic component can increase the oil phase volume of the topical formulation to provide desirable qualitites such as spreadability and feel, while at the same time not appreciably altering the degree of s^"ti"i"^ti"" nr thRrmndvnamir. activitv of the IRM. For examole. the<br><br>
IRM saturation while maintaining a sufficient oil phase volume by virtue of the addition o the hydrophobic, aprotic component, which does not offset the increased IRM saturation. Thus, the topical formulation of the present invention can facilitate both physical property and drug delivery requirements. Degree of saturation and thermodynamic activity of the IRM in these formulations is equal to the IRM concentration in the oil phase divided by the saturation concentration of the IRM in the oil phase. When the topical formulations ol the present invention contain saturated IRM the thermodynamic activity or degree of saturation is unity, and when partially saturated the thermodynamic activity or degree of saturation is less than unity.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples are provided to further describe various IRM formulations and methods according to the invention. The examples, however, are not intended to limit the formulations and methods within the spirit and scope of the invention. Examples 1-7 and Comparative Example CI<br>
Table 1 summarizes topical formulations made in accordance with the present invention in a percentage weight-by-weight basis.<br><br><br><br>
The formulations set forth in Table 1 were prepared in the following manner:<br>
Oil phase preparation: 2-methyl-1 -(2-methylpropyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c] [l,5]naphthyridin-4-amine (IRM compound 1) was dissolved in isostearic acid and isopropyl myristate, with heat if necessary. Carbomer 974P was then dispersed in the oil phase.<br>
Water phase preparation: Edetate disodium was dissolved in the water. Methylparaben and propylparaben were dissolved in propylene glycol and the solution was subsequently added to the water phase. Poloxamer 188 was then added to the water phase and mixed until dissolved.<br>
Phase combination: The oil phase was added to the water phase at ambient conditions.    ,v<br>
The emulsion was then homogenized. After homogenization, sodium hydroxide solution	"<br>
(20% w/w) was added and the resulting cream was mixed until smooth and uniform. The pH of the cream was measured and a pH adjustment was made with additional sodium hydroxide solution, if necessary, to meet the in-process target pH of 5.<br>
Formulations containing 2-methyl-l-(2-methylpropyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c] [l,5]naphthyridin-4-amine (IRM Compound 1) were tested for their ability to induce increases in cytokine concentrations in rats following topical application. This study was undertaken to evaluate cytokine induction following a single dosing of various strengths and timepoints or a multiple vs. single dosing of IRM Compound 1. The formulations described above were tested by examining tissue and serum concentrations of TNF-a, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and IFN-a cytokines following drug treatment.<br>
Female CD hairless rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 200-250 grams were used in all studies. Animals were randomized to treatment groups and dosed five per treatment group.<br>
The rats were acclimated to collars around the neck on two consecutive days prior to actual dosing. The rats were collared before dosing to prevent ingestion of the drug, and were then dosed topically with 50 \iL of active cream or the appropriate placebo on right flank and then housed individually following dosing. At various times following dosing, the rats were anesthetized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature and serum was separated from the clot via centrifugation and stored at -20 "C until it was analyzed for cytokine concentrations.<br><br>
Following blood collection, the rats were euthanized and their skins removed. Tissue from both treated site (at) and contralateral site (away) were obtained using an 8 mm punch biopsy, weighed, placed in a sealed 1.8 ml cryovial and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue sample was then suspended in 1.0 mL RPMI medium (Celox, Hopkins, MN) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol (RPMI complete) combined with a protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The tissue was homogenized using a Tissue Tearor™ (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) for approximately 1 minute. The tissue suspension was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes under refrigeration to pellet debris, and the supernatant collected and stored at -20 °C until analyzed for cytokine concentrations.<br>
ELISAs for rat MCP-1 were purchased from BioSource Intl. (Camarillo, CA) and rat TNF-a were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and performed according to manufacturer"s specifications. Results for both TNF-a, and MCP-1 were expressed in pg/200 mg tissue or pg/ml serum. The sensitivity of the TNF-a ELISA was 31.2 pg/ml and of the MCP-1 ELISA was 11.7 pg/ml. IFN-a concentrations in both serum and skin tissue were determined using a bioassay that measured inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on rat LMS-C2 fibroblast cells as previously described (Reiter, M. J., Testemian, T. L., Miller, R. L., Weeks, C. E., and Tomai, M. A. (1994) "Cytokine Induction in Mice by the Immunomodulator Imiquimod." J. Leukocyte Biol. 55, 234-240). IIT Research Institute, Chicago IL, performed these assays. Results for IFN-a concentrations were normalized to a standard reference rat IFN-a, preparation with results being reported in U/mL and are normalized per mg of tissue.<br>
The data shown below in Tables 2-4 are from three separate experiments and analyzed to 1) measure pharmacokinetics by full time course, 2) measure dose response and 3) measure multiple vs. single dosing.<br>
In order to determine the kinetics of local and systemic cytokine production following local administration of IRM Compound 1, the full time course study (Study 1 with results in Table 2) was done by topically dosing rats with the topical cream formulation of Example 7.<br><br>
Serum and tissue samples were taken at 1, 2,4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours post dose. Multiple cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-a and IFN-a) were analyzed separately.<br>
With the tissue data, for each hour measured, a paired t-test (used to eliminate within subject variability) analyzed the difference between treated tissue and control tissue from the same animal. A p-value less than alpha=0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference between the treated and control tissue at that hour. The data are presented in Table 2.<br><br>

The tissue is homogenized using a Tissue Tearor™ (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) for approximately 1 minute. The tissue suspension is then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes under refrigeration to pellet debris. The supernatant is collected and stored at -20°C until analyzed for cytokine concentrations.<br>
ELISAs for rat MCP-1 are purchased from BioSource Intl. (Camarillo, CA) and rat TNF-a are purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and performed according to<br><br>
manufacturer"s specifications. Results are expressed in pg/ml, the values for the tissue<br>
samples are normalized per 200 mg of tissue. The sensitivity of the<br>
MCP-1 ELISA is 12 pg/ml and the sensitivity of the TNF-a ELISA is 31 pg/ml.<br><br><br>
