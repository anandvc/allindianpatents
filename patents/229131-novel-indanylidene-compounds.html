The invention relates to novel indanylidene compounds which are effective in absorbing ultra violet radiation and to light screening compositions comprising said indanylidene compounds.<br>
Light screening compositions comprising indanylidene compounds are described in the European patent publication EP 0823 418 A2. This publication especially refers to cyano-(2,3-dihydroxy-lH-inden-l-ylidene) acetic acid ester compounds. These compounds do not have a sufficient solubility in the media usually employed in cosmetics, in particular in oil and fats. Furthermore, it is desirable that the active ingredient remain on the surface of the skin rather than penetrate into or through the skin.<br>
It has now been found that compounds having an indanylidene residue grafted via a linker to a silane, an oligosiloxane- or a polysiloxane moiety overcome the problem of penetration and show improved solubility.<br>
According to this invention there are provided compounds of the general formula I<br><br><br>

Example i:<br>
Cyano-(2,3-dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-3,3-dimethyl -lH-inden-1-ylidene) acetic acid ethyl ester <br>
122 g (0.55 mol) of 2,3-Dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-3,3-dimethyl-lH-inden-l-one (CAS N°[4136-26-9] for preparation see F. Camps, Z. Naturforsch., B : Anorg. Chem., Org. Chem. (1984), 39B (12), 1801-5), 63,3 g (0.56 mol) of ethyl cyano acetate, 12 g (0.14 mol) of piperidine, 12 g (0.1 mol) of benzoic acid and 1000 ml toluene were mixed together and heated under reflux for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, washed with diluted HC1, aq Na2CC&gt;3, water and dried (MgS04). Removal of the solvent and crystallization from EtOH gave 123.8 g of a yellow solid (m.p.: 148-149 °C). Yield : 71% ; E1%cm : 790 (1 max.: 367 nm) in EtOH. Solubility: 0.35% in Cetiol LC<br>
Example 2:<br>

a) 3-(l,l,3,3,3-Pentamethy-disiloxanyl)-propanol<br>
A 50 ml reaction flask was charged with 13.6 ml (200 mmol) of allylic alcohol and a catalytic amount of divinyl-tetramethyl disiloxane platinum complex under inert atmosphere and heated to 60°C. 19.5 ml (lOOmmol) of pentamethyl disiloxane was slowly added through a dropping funnel. The exothermic reaction mixture was stirred over night at 75°C, followed by a distillation at 105 to 107°C / 40 to 41 mbar over a Vigreux column. Yield 18.3 g (88.5% of the theory) of a clear liquid.<br><br>
b) Transesterification<br>
A 25 ml reaction flask equipped with a distillation bridge and connected to vacuum was charged with 2 g (6.3 mmol) of cyano-(2,3-dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-33-dimethyl -1H-inden-1-ylidene) acetic acid ethyl ester (see Example 1), 1.37 g (6.6 mmol) of 3-(l,1,3,3,3-pentamethy-disiloxanyl)-propanol (see above) and 3 mg of tetraisopropyl ortho titanate. The mixture was heated to 115 to 120°C at a vacuum of 360 mbar with stirring for 11 hours. The excess of silylated alcohol was removed at 100°C / 0.2 mbar and the residual product was chromatographed over SiC&gt;2 in hexane: ethylacetate (9.1 to 8:2) to yield 1.2 g (41%) of a liquid honey (m.p.: ca. 25°C), UV 364 nm (s=26'093), which showed excellent solubility in cosmetic solvents such as &gt;20% in Cetiol LC (Coco-caprylate/caprate) and was miscible in Crodamol DA (Diisopropyl adipate). The product showed an excellent photostability in high dilution of an ethanol solution using a Hg-lamp 150 W from Heraeus with Pyrex filter.<br>

b)	Transesterification<br>
The reaction of Example 2b was repeated using 3-(l,l,3,3,3-pentamethy-disiloxanyl)-2-methyl propanol (see above) instead of 3-(l,1,3,3,3-pentamethy-disiloxanyl)-propanol. After 15 hours reaction time the product was concentrated and<br><br>
:hromatographed as above to yield 57% of a liquid material. UV 364 nm (e=25,200), laving the same solubility and photostability qualities as described in Example 2b.<br>
