HALOGENATED SELECITVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a novel class of androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM). The SARM compounds are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADD?), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; and/or h) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [00021 The androgen receptor ("AR") is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens- Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern (Matsumoto, Endocrinol. Met Clin. N. Am. 23:857-75 (1994)). The endogenous steroidal androgens<br><br>
include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ("DHT"). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by Hie testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions (Zhou, et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 9:208-18 (1995)). Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone, such as the cypionate, propionate, phenylpropionate, cyclopentylpropionate, isocarporate, enanthate, and decanoate esters, and other synthetic androgens such as 7-Methyl-Nortestosterone ("MENT) and its acetate ester (Sundaram et al., "7 Alpha-Methyl-Nortestosterone(MENT): The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception,' Ann. Med., 25:199-205 (1993) ("Sundaram")). Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.<br>
[0003] Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma, religious implications, and, most certainly, significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices, historically, society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits, women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices, from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more pefananent options, such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However, to date, the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use, however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity, the interruption in sexual spontaneity, and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men, particularly long-term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior<br><br>
to a sexual act, such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.<br>
[0004] Administration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressing and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (Steinberger et aL, "Effect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone Levels: A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive, Fertility and Sterility 28:1320-28 (1977)). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very low level (oligospermia). The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However, a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia (i.e., less than 3 million sperm per ml) and infertility in 98% of men receiving therapy (World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility, "Contraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone-Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men," Fertility and Sterility 65:821-29 (1996)).<br>
[0005] A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in tains of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception, it has several drawbacks,. including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection (Wu, "Effects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men: Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study," Fertility and Sterility 65:626-36 (1996)).<br>
[0006] Steroidal ligands which bind the AR and act as androgens (e.g. testosterone enanthate) or as antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have been known for many years and are used clinically (Wu 1988). Although nonsteroidal antiandrogens are in<br><br>
clinical use for hormone-dependent prostate cancer, nonsteroidal androgens have not been reported. For this reason, research on male contraceptives has focused solely on steroidal compounds.<br>
[0007] Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One approach to this problem is to find prostate cancer earlier through screening programs and thereby reduce the number of advanced prostate cancer patients. Another strategy, however, is to develop drugs to prevent prostate cancer. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). THe number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental fectors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer. Thus, the development of treatment and preventative strategies against prostate cancer may have the greatest, overall impact both medically and economically<br>
against prostate cancer.<br>

[0008] Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal diseaseor CHaracterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.<br><br>
[0009]'Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years folio-wing menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However, osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength, and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex-hormones in non-reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood, but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life-cycle. Consequently, when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males, the natural decline in sex-hormones at maturity (direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens) is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.<br>
[00010] Androgen decline in the aging male (ADAM) refers to a progressive decrease in androgen production, common in males after middle age. The syndrome is characterized by alterations in the physical and intellectual domains that correlate with and can be corrected by manipulation of the androgen milieu. ADAM is characterized biochemically by a decrease not only in serum androgen, but also in other hormones, such as growth hormone, melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone. Clinical manifestations include fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, benign prostate hyperplasia, and alterations in mood and cognition.<br>
[00011] Androgen Deficiency in Female (ADIF) refers to a variety of hormone-related conditions including, common in females after middle agest The syndrome is characterized by sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, anemia, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.<br><br>
[00012] Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathies), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle. The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation. Protein degradation occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein " degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein degradation, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. Muscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchienne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Diseaseor CHronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy, In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include, chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injuryor Chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damageor CHemical damage,<br>
bums, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long, term<br>
* * -	^<br>
hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism. Muscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, poor performance status and susceptibility to injury.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF SELECTIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOUNDS<br>
[000126]	Selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compounds are a novel<br>
class of androgen receptor targeting agents ("ARTA"), that have previously been shown to be useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related<br><br>
conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; and/or h) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell.<br>
[000127]	As used herein, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are<br>
collectively referred to as "cell signaling receptors". Many'cell signaling receptors are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface; when they bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), they become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell.<br>
[000128]	Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that<br>
diffuse directly, across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.<br>
[000129]	In addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be<br>
blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-<br><br>
dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cell, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific, genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction).<br>
[000130]	In one  embodiment, die present invention is directed to selective<br>
androgen receptor modulator compounds which are agonist compounds. A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and activating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the agonist compound of the present invention is an agonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the agonist compound also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the present invention provides selective androgen modulator compounds which have agonistic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal compound for the androgen receptor.<br>
[000131]	In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to selective<br>
androgen receptor modulator compounds which are antagonist compounds. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and inactivating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the antagonist compound of the present invention is an antagonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor.<br><br>
[000132]	In a yet another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present<br>
invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as inhibitors at the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.<br>
[000133]	Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are<br>
AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.<br>
[000134]	The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or<br>
irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.<br>
[000135]	In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the<br>
androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human * Thus, in one embodiment/the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylaiion of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous Iigands DHT and testosterone. An "alkylating agent" is defined herein as an agent which alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active<br><br>
molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.<br>
[000136]	According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is<br>
provided for binding the SARM compounds of the present invention to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a SARM compound and/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, prodrug, polymorph, crystal or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the selective androgen receptor modulator compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the selective androgen receptor modulator compounds to the androgen receptor enables .the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.<br>

found in any internal organ and the major cause of morbidity in the adult male. BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade. BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to empty Urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure.<br>

Obesity is often multifactorial, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Overweight due to obesity is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including: Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes; high blood pressure (hypertension); stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA); heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI); heart failure (congestive heart failure); cancer (certain forms such as cancer of the prostate and cancer of the colon and'rectum); gallstones and gallbladder ' disease (cholecystitis); Gout and gouty arthritis; osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) of the knees, hips, and the lower back; sleep apnea (failure to breath normally during sleep, lowering blood oxygen); and Pickwickian syndrome (obesity, red face, underventilation and drowsiness). As contemplated herein, the term "obesity" includes any one of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases. Thus the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and/or treating obesity and any one or more of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases.<br><br>
[000163]	"Prostate cancer" is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among<br>
men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer.<br>

In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.<br><br>
[000179]	In addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e.g. acacia,<br>

[000180]	In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are<br>
controlled release compositions, i.e. compositions in which the SARM compound is released.over a period of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots-(e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.<br>
[000181]	In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be<br>
delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used<br><br>
(see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Grit Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et aL, Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et aL, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of. the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol, 2, pp. 115-138 (1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990).<br>
[000182]	The compositions may also include incorporation of the active material<br>
into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, inicroemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo release, aijd rate.of.in vivo clearance,<br>
[000183]	Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated<br>
with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.<br>

covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et aL, 1981; Newmark et aL, 1982; and Katre et aL,' 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.<br><br>
[000185]	The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active<br>
component is well understood in the art, fox example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically  acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.<br>
[000186]	An active component can be formulated into the composition as<br>
neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or<br>
antibody, molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example,<br>
hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric,<br>
mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived<br>
from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or<br>
ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-<br>
ethylamino ethairol, histidine, procaine, and the like. '	-  - -<br>
[000187]	For use in medicine, the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid,<br><br>
maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.<br>

[000190]	The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS SECTION<br>
EXAMPLE 1-ANl)ROGENIC AND ANABOLIC ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS 1-4<br>
[000191]	Binding affinities of select B-ring F, CI, Br, Iated SARMS were<br>
determined and are represented in Table 1:<br><br><br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
[000192]	Animals.   Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 90 to lOOg,<br>
were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.<br>
[000193]	Study Design.   Rats were randomly distributed into treatment groups<br>
groups. One day prior to the start of drug treatment, animals were individually removed from the cage, weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine/xylazine (87/13 mg/kg; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pinch), the animals'- ears were marked for identification purposes- Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.<br>
[000194]	Twenty-four    hours    later,    animals    were    re-anesthetized    with<br>
ketamine/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved<br><br>
and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).<br>
[000195]	After   14   days   of drug  treatment,   rats  were   anesthetized   with<br>
ketamine/xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at -20°C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.<br>
[000196]	For data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body<br>
weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.<br>
RESULTS<br>
[000197]	The androgenic and anabolic activities of compounds 1-4 were examined<br>
in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. The results are shown in Figure 1 A-D as a percent of the Intact Contol (not castrated, untreated). Omg/day denotes Castrated Controls (castrated, untreated).<br><br>
[000198]	As shown in Figure 1, the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and<br>
levator ani muscle in castrated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Treatment with increasing dosages of compounds 1-4 (Figure 1 A-D respectively) resulted in a tissue-selective increase in levator ani muscle weights, with little or no stimulation of prostate and seminal vesicle growth (i.e. the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 40% of that observed in intact animals for compound 2, and less than 20% for compounds 1, 3 and 4). Thus these compounds showed little potency and intrinsic activity* in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a great potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly, compound 2 was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus, compounds 1-4 are potent nonsteroidal anabolic agents. This is a significant improvement over previous compounds, in that these compound selectively stimulate muscle growth and other.anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.<br>
EXAMPLE2-ANDROGENIC AND ANABOLIC ACTIVITY OF COMPOUND 5<br>
[000199]	The binding affinitiy of select compound 5 is represented in Table 2:<br><br><br>
[000200]	The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 5 was examined in a<br>
castrated rat model after 14 days of administration, using the method outlined in Example 1 above.<br>
[000201]	As shown in Table 3 and in Figure 2, compound 5 demonstrated tissue-<br>
selective pharmacological effects in castrated male rats, with higher efficacy in anabolic tissues (i.e. levator ani) as compared to androgenic tissues (i.e. prostate and seminal vesicles). Compound 5 demonstrated little pharmacologic activity in the prostate (8.7± 1.39% of intact at 1.0 mg/day dose) and sminal vesicles (10.7± 0.91% of intact at 1.0 mg/day dose), suggesting that it acts as a weak partial agonist in these tissues. Importantly, compound 5 demonstrates highly efficacious anabolic activity at 1.0 mg/day dose, returning the levator ani muscle to 75.2± 9.51% of that observed in intact animals.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3-ANDROGENIC AND ANABOLIC ACTIVITY OF COMPOUND 6<br>
[000202]	The binding affinitiy of select compound 6 is represented in Table 4:<br><br><br><br>
[000203]	The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 6 was examined in a<br>
castrated rat model after 14 days of administration, using the method outlined in Example 1 above.<br>
[000204]	As shown in Figure 3, the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and<br>
levator ani muscle in castrated, vehicle-treated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Exogenous administration of testosterone propionate,. an androgenic and anabolic steroid, increased the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated rats in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with compound 6 resulted in dose-dependent increases in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights. Compared with testosterone propionate, compound 6 showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly, compound V, at a dose as low as 0.3 mg/day, was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus, compound 6 is a potent nonsteroidal anabolic agent with less androgenic activity but more anabolic activity than testosterone propionate. As in compounds 1-5 above, this is a significant improvement in that this compound selectively stimulates muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4 Binding Affmties of Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators<br>
[000205]	The in-vitro   androgen receptor binding  affinity  of other  SARM<br>
compounds was studied and the results are presented in Table 5.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES Nonsteroidal Ligands with Androgenic and Anabolic Activity<br>
[000206]	The in-vivo efficacy and acute toxicity of four nonsteroidal androgens<br>
(compounds 1, 21, 22 and 23) in rats was examined. Ih-vitro assays established that these compounds bind tiie androgen receptor with very high affinity. The structures and names of the four compounds are presented below:<br><br>
Compound 1	R=F<br>
Compound 21	R==NHCOCH3<br>
Compound 22	R=COCH3<br>
Compound 23	R=COC2H5<br>
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
[000207]	Materials. The S-isomers of 1,21,22 and 23 and R-isomer of compound<br>
1 were synthesized in accordance with the scheme as set forth in Figure 7, Testosterone propionate (TP), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300, reagent grade) and neutral buffered formalin (10% w/v) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis, MO). Alzet osmotic pumps (model 2002) were purchased from Alza Corp. (Palo Alto, CA).<br>
[000208]	Animals,   Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 90 to lOOg,<br>
were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.<br><br>
[000209]	Study Design..   Rats were randomly distributed into twenty-nine (29)<br>
groups, with 5 animals per group. Treatment groups are described in Table 6. One day-prior to the start of drag treatment, animals in groups 2 through 29 were individually removed from the cage, weighted and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine/xylazine (87/13 mg/kg; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pinch), the animals' ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.<br>
[000210]	Twenty-four hours later, animals in groups 2 through 29 were re-<br>
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their : cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment (designated in Table 1) dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).<br>
[000211]	After   14   days   of drug  treatment,   rats   were   anesthetized   with<br>
ketamine/xylazine, Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at -20°C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials<br><br>
containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.<br>
[000212]	For data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body<br>
weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.<br>
RESULTS<br>
[000213]	The androgenic and anabolic activities the S isomers of compounds 1, 21,<br>
22 and 23, and the R isomer of compound 1 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. Testosterone propionate, at increasing doses, was used as the positive control of anabolic and androgenic effects.<br>
[000214]	As shown in Figure 4, the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and<br>
levator ani muscle in castrated, vehicle-treated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Exogenous administration of testosterone propionate, an androgenic and anabolic steroid, increased the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated rats in a dose-dependent manner. The R-isomer of compound 1, and S-isomers of compounds 22 and 23 showed no effect on the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated animals ' (data not shown). The S-isomer of compound 1 (Figure 4) resulted in dose-dependent ~ increases in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights.<br>
[000215]	Compound   1   but  showed  great  tissue   selectivity.  Compound   1<br>
significantly increased levator ani muscle weights, but showed little to no ability to stimulate prostate and seminal vesicle growth (i.e., the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 20% of that observed in intact animals or in animals treated with testosterone propionate).<br><br>
[000216]	In  summary,   Compound   1   showed  selective   anabolic  activity  in<br>
comparison with testosterone propionate, an androgenic and anabolic steroid. The tissue-selective activity is actually one of the advantages of nonsteroidal androgens in terms of anabolic-related applications,<br>
[000217]	None of the examined compounds produced significant effect on body<br>
weight or the weights of other organs (i.e., liver, lddneys, spleen, lungs and heart). Nor did any compound produce any signs of acute toxicity, as gauged by diagnostic hematology tests and visual examination of animals receiving treatments. Importantly, compound 21 did not suppress the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at a dose of 0.3 mg/day (i.e., a dose that exhibited maximal anabolic effects).<br>
.. [000218] . These studies show the discovery of compound 1 is a member of a class of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS) that demonstrates potent anabolic effects (e.g., muscle growth) with less androgenic activity (e.g., prostatic growth). This new class of drugs has several advantages over non-selective androgens, including potential therapeutic applications in males and females for modulation of fertility, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, sexual libido and in men with or at high risk for prostate cancer.<br>
[000219]	Further, Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate the effects-of compound 1 and<br>
compound 21 on LH and FSH levels in rats. These results further demonstrate the novelty of these' SASMs, due to" their differential effects on these reproductive hormones, thus demonstrating the tissue-specific pharmacologic activity. In Figure 5, LH levels in castrated animals treated with TP and compound 1 were significantly lower than those of untreated animals (i.e., castrated controls) at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/day. However, higher doses (Le., 0.5 mg/day or higher) of compound 21 were required before significant decreases in LH levels were observed. Thus, compound 21 does not suppress LH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth. In Figure 6, FSH levels in castrated animals treated with compound 1 were significantly lower than those of untreated animals (i.e., castrated<br><br>
controls) at doses of 0.5 mg/day or higher. Similarly, lower FSH levels were observed in animals treated with IP. However, only this difference was only significant at a dose of 0.75 mg/day. FSH levels in animals treated with compound 21 were not significantly different from those of untreated anfmals at any dose level tested. Thus, compound 21 does not suppress FSH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 - SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES<br>
[000221]	(2R)-l-Methacryloylpyrrolidin-2-carboxylic Acid (R-129). D-Proline<br>
(R-128, 14.93 g, 0.13 mol) was dissolved in 71 mL of 2 N NaOH and cooled in an ice bath; the resulting alkaline solution was diluted with acetone (71 mL). An acetone solution (71 mL) of metacryloly chloride 127 (13.56 g3 0.13 mol) and 2N NaOH solution (71 mL) were simultaneously added over 40 min to the aqueous solution of D-proline in an ice bath. The pH of the mixture was kept at 10-11°C during the addition of the metacryloly chloride. After stirring (3 h, room temperature), the mixture was evaporated in vacuo at a temperature at 35-45 °C to remove acetone. The resulting solution was washed with ethyl ether and was acidified to pH 2 with concentrated HC1. The acidic mixture was saturated with NaCl and was extracted with EtOAc (100 mL x 3).
